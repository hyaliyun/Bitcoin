Geneva (Switzerland) Holy Trinity Church, Geneva, Switzerland, was completed in 1853. The church is located at rue du Mont-Blanc, between the Gen√®ve-Cornavin railway station and the famous hotels at the banks of Lake Geneva. The church is part of the Diocese in Europe of the Church of England and is also a Swiss monument of regional significance (class B).Registered with KGS No. 2515. History In 1555 services in English had been celebrated according to the rites of the Geneva Reformed Church for Marian exiles. The place of worship has been in the Church of Sainte-Marie-la-Neuve (Auditoire). One year later John Knox was elected as minister. The first Anglican worship was held by Rev. Gilbert Burnet in 1685. There has been organised Anglican worship in the Old Hospital Chapel (place du Bourg de Four) since 1814. In 1846 the English community decided to build a church of their own. Land was given by the State of Geneva, and the foundation stone was laid by bishop Charles Sumner in 1851. The construction was entirely financed by private subscription. The church was consecrated by the Bishop of Winchester on 30 August 1853. The East window was presented by Mrs. Jephson in 1884. The other stained-glass windows had been created by Jacques Wasem from 1958 to 1981. The Parish hall was constructed in 1966. Renovations took place in 1976 and from 1983 to 1985. The new organ had been installed in 1985 and updated in 2015. The church has many plaques and memorials to individuals who died in Geneva or in the Swiss Alps. A new constitution was adopted in 1910. Holy Trinity became a society instead of a foundation. The 150th anniversary of the church was celebrated with an exhibition at the Geneva State Archives.

Life =Early career (1805‚Äì50)= Andr√© C√©sar V√©rand was born on 18 February 1805 in Toulon. He joined the navy on 17 December 1828, and became a navy clerk on 1 January 1830. V√©rand was promoted to senior navy clerk (commis principal de la marine) as of 26 April 1845. He was promoted to Deputy Commissioner on 23 December 1847. V√©rand was appointed Knight of the Legion of Honour on 22 May 1850 as deputy commissioner in Guadeloupe. He became an Assistant Commissioner (commissaire-adjoint de la marine) on 5 August 1850. =Senegal (1850‚Äì54)= On 25 October 1850 V√©rand was appointed head of the Senegal administrative services. On 11 December 1851 V√©rand married Anne Louise Seveau (1809‚Äì1882) in Saint Louis, Senegal. From May 1853 to 30 January 1854 V√©rand was acting governor of Senegal in place of Auguste L√©opold Protet. He was ordonnateur in Senegal from 22 May 1853 until 25 April 1854, when he was replaced by Victor- √âtienne Costet as acting ordonnateur. He was promoted to Commissioner on 18 October 1853. =Mayotte (1854‚Äì56)= From 1854 V√©rand was Commanding Officer on Mayotte, an archipelago between Madagascar and Mozambique. Conditions on the plantations were deteriorating, with workers complaining of abuses such as lack of payment and seizure of their land without compensation. On 2 October 1855 V√©rand issued a decree that imposed forced labour contracts of 3-5 years on all the islanders, and prevented workers from leaving their work without authorization after they had filed complaints. On 18 March 1856 there was a revolt on Mayotte after V√©rand had sailed to Nosy Be to look into a case where three men with spears had attacked a plantain supervisor. 500-600 Sakalavas and Mozambicans left the plantations and took refuge in the mountains. Attempts were made to negotiate with the rebels, while a curfew was imposed. V√©rand returned on 3 April 1856, stopped the negotiations, imposed a state of siege and called for military assistance from R√©union. He refused to improve conditions on the plantations for workers who returned. before the start of the rice harvest. Military action in April and May intimidated most of the rebels into returning to their villages. A judicial inquiry in June resulted in public execution of the leader of the revolt and sentences of forced labour for other rebels. In 1857 V√©rand surprisingly took the side of seven leading Mayotte citizens against ten French planters in a land dispute. =Later career (1856‚Äì69)= V√©rand was in French Guiana in 1858. He was promoted to Officer of the Legion of Honour on 30 December 1858. On 16 December 1861 V√©rand, commissaire de marine 1st class, returned to French Guiana from leave and resumed his functions as Ordonnateur.

Cambodia's ancient geologic history in the Precambrian is poorly understood. The region experienced tectonic activity and low-grade metamorphic rock formation throughout the Paleozoic, which a shift to marine conditions and fossil formation during the Permian and through much of the Mesozoic. Few rocks remain from the Cenozoic. Cambodia has comparatively few natural resources, although there is bauxite formed from laterite weathering, as well as phosphorite, iron, gems, limestone and other materials. Stratigraphy, Tectonics & Geologic History There are no dated Precambrian rocks in Cambodia, but the gneiss and schist of the Proterozoic Kontum Massif Vietnam extend into the northeast of the country from Vietnam. High-grade metamorphic rocks that may be from the Precambrian are also found at Pailin in the west. This area has gneiss and amphibolite, diorite, granodiorite and relatively uniform mineralogy including quartz, plagioclase and hornblende. =Paleozoic (541-251 million years ago)= Not much is known about the early Paleozoic in Cambodia. Some rock sequences without fossils have been mapped as Cambrian and Silurian rocks because they underlie younger Paleozoic rocks. They tend to be intensely deformed and have low-grade regional metamorphism and are most common in southern Cambodian. Quartzite is interbedded with rhyolite, quartz, tourmaline schist, sericite shist and chlorite schist. Some true mica schist is also found along with sillimanite but the grade of metamorphism tends to be low. Only one fossil in Cambodia is known from the Cambrian. It is a trilobite from 10 kilometers northwest of Stung Treng in the north. The fossil is housed in black, sandy argillite. Late Paleozoic rocks from the Devonian to the Carboniferous are common in southern Cambodia. Most exposures lack fossils, and many are strongly folded and heavily fractured, containingchert and jasper. In some cases, there are trace radiolaria and sponge fossils. Sandstone, black shale, breccia, and limestone are found toward the top of the sequences. The Permian is primarily marked by limestones with large occurrences at Battambang. Extensive Permian limestone rocks are found at Sisophon in the west and to the south at Kampot, containing coral and brachiopod fossils. These fossils helped to establish the age of the limestone which is sometimes interbedded with clastic rocks. There is extensive karst landscape with many caves underlying much of Cambodia. =Mesozoic (251-66 million years ago)= Triassic rocks are very common in Cambodia, although they do not contain many fossils. Marine Triassic rocks are well documented near Rovieng in the north. Triassic rocks include shale, sandstone, conglomerates and some fragments of volcanic rocks including andesite. The Indosinian Orogeny in the Triassic affected the region with some moderate folding. Hydrocarbon research on the Khorat Plateau suggests that the Indochina Terrane was a series of continental fault blocks separated by Permian rifting. Marine conditions were common, although the later periods were marked by lagoon and continent conditions and red beds formed. During the Jurassic marine conditions returned. A fossil ammonite was found at one location in eastern Cambodia. The Sre Pok Valley has numerous beds of rock with ammonite fossils, recording deep water sediments near the Vietnamese border by the Middle Jurassic. Continental conditions were the norm and thick sequences of sandstone and conglomerate formed during the Cretaceous. These comprise much of the Cardamome Mountains in the southwest and can be up to one to two kilometers thick. Sometimes these rocks also contain plan and pollen remains. =Cenozoic (66 million years ago-present)= There are very few Cenozoic rocks in Cambodia. However, there is quite a bit of evidence from the Quaternary, the last 2.5 million years, particularly in floodplains and valleys where terraces in the sediment are common. However, sometimes these deposits are very thin over underlying bedrock. Natural resource geology Cambodia has few natural resources, mainly gold and some non-metallic minerals. Artisanal mining often extracts gold bearing alluvium, which originated from quartz veins in different rocks. Gold was found at Suptrup in 1877 and mined until 1940. Bauxite, iron ore, tin, greisen and aplite are also known, although only bauxite appears to be economically valuable. Bauxite formed from laterite weathering of Cenozoic basalt on the Haut Chhalong Plateau near the Vietnamese border. Phosphorite and limestone are the main non metallic minerals. Phosphorite forms in caves and fissures from Permian organic material. A small phosphorite mine opened in 1966 with a crushing plant after having first been worked starting in 1919. Cambodia also has gems including sapphire. Pailin, in the area of Bokeo is known for large, high quality zircon crystals. History of geologic research Geological mapping of Cambodia was first carried out by the French service, Service Geologique de l'Indochine based in Hanoi in the years between World War I and World War II. Various mineral prospects were explored at that time and again in the 1950s and 1960s with the assistance after independence of France, China in the UN between 1967 and 1970. The whole country was mapped in a reconnaissance level by French geologists and a 1:200,000 scale map with 14 sheets was published. Out of a pre-1975 staff of 60 only eight returned including four technicians after the Khmer Rouge. Currently the responsibility for mapping rests with the Department of Geology and Mines and the Ministry of Industry.

History The Journal of NIH Research was established in 1989 by William Miller and Tod Herbers, both former employees of the American Association for the Advancement of Science. Miller and Herbers received funding to start the publication from a group of venture capitalists, including Martin Peretz, the then-chair of The New Republic.

When the magazine was first launched, 35,000 copies of it were sent to NIH-funded researchers for free, and Miller and Herbers planned to make all the revenue they needed from advertising. After they failed to generate enough revenue to keep producing the magazine, Miller and Herbers sold it to Medical Economics Company, based in Montvale, New Jersey, in 1994. Medical Economics soon tried to cut the magazine's costs by telling Barnes to reduce the size of the magazine's six-person staff. Rather than comply, Barnes resigned from her position as editor in February 1996. Medical Economics decided that it would permanently stop publishing the magazine in 1997, after failing to either generate enough revenue to keep publishing it or to find another company willing to buy it.

Zhao Pu (922 ‚Äì 14 August 992), courtesy name Zeping, was a Chinese politician and strategist during the reigns of the first two Song dynasty emperors (Emperor Taizu and Emperor Taizong), who was instrumental in plotting the seizure and consolidation of power for both of them. Despite several crisis in his long career, Zhao Pu was by far the most powerful politician for most of the early Song dynasty, serving as a chief councilor (in many years the only one) three times for a total of 17 years. He has been praised for his brilliance in foreign and domestic policies which helped shape Song's Confucian outlook for the next 2‚Äì3 centuries. A proud Confucian (though not as learned as later ministers who came from the imperial examination), Zhao Pu is well known for allegedly claiming that he administered the state with \\"half the Analects\\".http://baijiahao.baidu.com/s?id=1600605672120551687 Confucian historians, however, also note his cunning, avarice, as well as ruthlessness towards political opponents like Lu Duoxun and Zhao Tingmei, all self-serving and un-Confucian traits. Biography Before he entered politics, he was a tutor and was hired by the future Empress Dowager Du to tutor her son Zhao Kuangyin along with another tutor named Chen. Kuangyin always consulted Pu but ignored Chen's advice because of the tutor's constant scolding for his impatience. Once Zhao Kuangyin became Emperor Taizu, he invited Zhao Pu to become Grand Chancellor. In 961, he was summoned by Emperor Taizu to record the will of his mother Empress Dowager Du which she stated that upon Taizu's death, would go to his brother Zhao Guangyi and then upon Guangyi's death, would go to Zhao Guangmei, the youngest surviving brother. Before Du died, she told Zhao Pu to follow her words. Zhao Pu who recorded the entire conversation signed it and kept it in a golden box. Zhao Pu was relieved of his post of Grand Chancellor and banished by Emperor Taizu in 973 due to rumors that he was being corrupt by the war minister Lu Duoxun (934 ‚Äì 985) whom Zhao Pu bore a grudge against for repeatedly criticizing him. Lu did this to increase his own power and gain the favor of the Emperor. However, Pu was recalled back into the capital once Emperor Taizu died in which he was succeeded by Zhao Guangyi. Zhao Guangyi would become Emperor Taizong posthumously. Zhao Pu became chancellor and then accused Zhao Tingmei ( ‚Äì 984 (formerly named Zhao Guangmei)) and Lu Duoxun for plotting against Emperor Taizong and as a result, Tingmei was imprisoned while Lu was exiled. It is worth mentioning that Zhao Pu advised Emperor Taizong to have his own son become Emperor instead of Zhao Tingmei.

She was laid down in 1875 at the AG Vulcan shipyard in Stettin, was launched in June 1876, and was commissioned into the fleet in August 1877. Originally named Sedan after the Battle of Sedan of the Franco-Prussian War, she was renamed Prinz Adalbert to avoid antagonizing France in 1878, less than a decade after the battle. Prinz Adalbert went on two overseas cruises during her career, both to East Asia. The first, from late 1878 to late 1880, was uneventful, though Prince Heinrich, the Kaiser's grandson, was aboard the ship as part of his naval training. The second cruise, from late 1883 to late 1885, was repeatedly altered; her voyage to East Asia was delayed by an order to carry Crown Prince Friedrich to Spain. Once she reached East Asia, she observed the Sino-French War of 1884, though she remained in the area for less than six months before being ordered home. The return voyage was delayed several times, first with orders to protect German interests in western South America, then to join a new cruiser squadron to settle a dispute with Zanzibar, once again to serve as the flagship of that squadron while the other vessel was being repaired, and again during a colonial dispute with Spain. After Prinz Adalbert returned to Germany, she was converted into a training ship for naval cadets, a role she filled for less than three years. Worn out by 1888, she was decommissioned and reduced to a barracks ship, a role she filled until 1907, when she was stricken from the naval register and broken up in Rotterdam. Design After the Franco-Prussian War of 1870‚Äì1871, the newly formed Kaiserliche Marine (Imperial Navy) began an expansion program to strengthen the fleet. The naval command determined that modern steam corvettes were necessary for scouting purposes, as well as overseas cruising duties to protect German interests abroad. The two Leipzig-class corvettes were ordered as part of the fleet plan of 1873, which called for a total of twenty unarmored corvettes, twelve of which were already either in service or under construction. Prinz Adalbert was long overall, with a beam of and a draft of forward. She displaced at full load. The ship's crew consisted of 39 officers and 386 enlisted men. She was powered by a single marine steam engine that drove one 2-bladed screw propeller, with steam provided by ten coal-fired fire-tube boilers, which gave her a top speed of at . She had a cruising radius of at a speed of . Prinz Adalbert was equipped with a full ship rig to supplement her steam engines on long-distance cruises. Prinz Adalbert was armed with a battery of twelve breech-loading guns, two of which were 25-caliber (cal.); the other ten were shorter 20-cal. weapons. Later in her career, she had four Hotchkiss revolver cannon installed, along with four torpedo tubes. These were all above-water launchers, with two in the bow and one on each side. Service history The keel for the second member of the Leipzig class was laid down in 1875, under the contract name \\"A\\", at the AG Vulcan shipyard in Stettin. She was launched on 17 June 1876 and christened by Konteradmiral (KAdm‚ÄîRear Admiral) Ludwig von Henk as Sedan, after the Battle of Sedan of the Franco-Prussian War. The ship was completed the following year, and she was commissioned into the fleet on 1 September 1877. She was then moved to Kiel for final fitting-out, which included the installation of the four torpedo tubes, making Sedan the first large German warship to be equipped with them. On 1 September 1878, her name was changed to Prinz Adalbert after Prince Adalbert of Prussia, by order of the Kaiserliche Admiralit√§t (Imperial Admiralty) so as to not offend France, since the French had been defeated at Sedan just eight years before. Prinz Adalbert remained out of service in 1878 owing to a shortage of officers and crewmen, since the available men had been assigned to the Armored Squadron, which was on a training cruise. Following the sinking of the ironclad in an accidental collision in May, the cruise was cancelled and the ships returned to Germany; the crews from the ironclads that were then placed in reserve could then be used to commission Prinz Adalbert for an overseas deployment. Naval cadets from the 1877 crew year, which included Prince Heinrich, were taken aboard for the cruise. Heinrich was briefly accompanied by his brother Wilhelm while the ship was in German waters. =First overseas deployment= German 1872 map of China, Japan, and Korea On 14 October 1878, the ship left Kiel, bound for East Asia, under the command of Kapit√§n zur See (KzS‚ÄîCaptain at Sea) Archibald MacLean. She sailed south through the Atlantic Ocean, around South America, passed through the Strait of Magellan and crossed the Pacific Ocean. Prinz Adalbert arrived in Japan in May 1879, and MacLean, having the earliest date of rank of the captains in East Asia, became the squadron commander. At the time, the East Asia Squadron also included the corvette and the gunboats and . Prinz Adalbert then began a tour of Japanese and Russian ports, at times in company with Luise. Prinz Adalbert remained in Japanese waters into early 1880, and visited a number of cities, include Kobe, Nagasaki, and Yokohama. Unrest in China threatened German interests, particularly around Shanghai, but Prinz Adalbert had too deep a draft to allow her to operate in the area, so only Luise, Wolf, and Cyclop were available to protect Germans in the city. Prinz Adalbert therefore remained in Hong Kong from May to June. While in Hong Kong, MacLean received word that the steam frigate had arrived in Japan to replace Prinz Adalbert, though at the time, the latter's crew was battling a severe gastrointestinal disease. It was hoped that the fresh air of the high seas would help the crew return to health, so Prinz Adalbert began the voyage back to Germany. She passed through the Dutch East Indies, stopping in the Sultanate of Johor, before transiting the Indian Ocean. She stopped in Simonstown, South Africa, and the island of Saint Helena, where the crew visited the tomb of Napoleon. The ship finally arrived in the Kieler F√∂rde on 29 September 1880, where she was greeted by Kaiser Wilhelm I, Prince Heinrich's grandfather, and Admiral Albrecht von Stosch, the chief of the Admiralit√§t. Since the voyage had gone so well, Stosch promoted MacLean to the rank of Konteradmiral; the ship's first officer, Kapit√§nleutnant (KL‚ÄîLieutenant Captain) Albert von Seckendorff, was also promoted. =Second overseas deployment= Sketch of Prinz Adalbert at sea, c. 1884 Prinz Adalbert remained out of service until 1883, when she was reactivated for another foreign deployment. Before she began the cruise, however, she was ordered to carry the Crown Prince, Frederick, from Genoa, Italy for a visit to Spain. She left Kiel on 20 October, and on 19 November, Frederick boarded the ship in Genoa. Prinz Adalbert was joined by the corvette and the old aviso for the trip to Spain. Severe storms battered the ships on the voyage to and from Spain. The flotilla arrived in Spanish waters on 24 November, where they remained until 15 December. While they were there, Loreley was detached to repair storm damage at Malta on 14 December. The next day, Prinz Adalbert and Sophie left to return to Genoa, where they arrived on 16 December and disembarked Frederick. From there, Prinz Adalbert was able to embark on the overseas cruise to East Asia for which she had been activated. She arrived in Singapore on 24 April 1884, where she replaced her sister ship . Prinz Adalbert then steamed to Shanghai, where she rendezvoused with the squadron flagship, the corvette , and its commander, KzS Carl Paschen. In mid- May, a fever epidemic broke out among the crews of the German ships, prompting Paschen to take the vessels to Japan to receive treatment, but in July, Prinz Adalbert and Stosch had to return to Chinese waters owing to increase in tensions that led to the Sino-French War the following month. The ships stayed in Shanghai until late August, when Paschen ordered Prinz Adalbert to sail to Fuzhou. The French squadron under Vice Admiral Am√©d√©e Courbet was preparing to attack the Chinese fleet there, and Prinz Adalbert joined warships from Britain and the United States to protect Europeans and Americans in the city. In the ensuing Battle of Fuzhou, the French rapidly defeated the Chinese forces, allowing Prinz Adalbert to return to Shanghai in early September. Shortly thereafter, she received orders to return to Germany. She left Shanghai and stopped in Japan and Papeete, Tahiti en route to South America. Prinz Adalbert arrived in Callao, Peru on 11 January 1885; here her voyage to Germany was interrupted with a change of orders. A conflict between Colombia and Nicaragua threatened German interests, prompting the German naval command to send Prinz Adalbert there to protect Germans in the area. She remained there for two months, before steaming south to Valparaiso, Chile, where she stayed from 21 to 28 March. From there she resumed her voyage back to Germany, and after rounding Cape Horn and entering the Atlantic, she arrived in Montevideo on 7 May. There, she again received new orders, diverting the ship to Mauritius, where she was to join a new cruiser squadron, again led by Paschen aboard Stosch. Paschen's new squadron was tasked with settling the dispute between Germany and Zanzibar over the protectorate of Wituland in eastern Africa. After the squadron was assembled in Mauritius, the ships proceeded to Zanzibar, where they quickly convinced the Sultan of Zanzibar to drop his objections to the protectorate. This allowed the squadron to be dissolved and Prinz Adalbert to resume her voyage home. She was again delayed, however, as Stosch was in need of maintenance, and so Paschen transferred to Prinz Adalbert while the former was in the dry dock in Cape Town. Prinz Adalbert went to the recently-acquired colony of Kamerun so Paschen, who had been promoted to the rank of Konteradmiral, could examine conditions there. In late November, Prinz Adalbert met with Stosch in Freetown; Paschen returned to his flagship, and the two ships steamed to Cape Verde to join the Training Squadron, which had stopped there during a dispute between Germany and Spain over the Caroline Islands. After Pope Leo XIII intervened to settle the dispute, Prinz Adalbert could finally resume the voyage back to Germany, where she arrived in Wilhelmshaven on 22 December. =Training ship= Shortly after her return to Wilhelmshaven, Prinz Adalbert was placed in the I. Reserve with a reduced crew. The navy decided to convert the vessel into a training ship, and she was reactivated for that role on 8 April 1886 with a crew of naval cadets and four-year volunteers aboard. The ship's commander at this time was KzS Iwan Oldekop. Prinz Adalbert began a series of short training cruises in the Baltic Sea to familiarize the crew with the ship before she joined the Training Squadron. The squadron participated in fleet exercises from 20 July to 15 August. Following the conclusion of the exercises, the Training Squadron embarked on a major cruise to the West Indies, departing Wilhelmshaven on 14 October. The ships were in Saint Thomas at the start of 1887, and on the way back to Germany, Prinz Adalbert collided with the Hamburg-flagged schooner Ellenholt, though she was not seriously damaged in the accident. The Training Squadron returned to Wilhelmshaven on 30 March, where Prinz Adalbert went into the Kaiserliche Werft (Imperial Shipyard) for repairs. Prinz Adalbert began the 1887 training schedule on 5 May with another contingent of cadets and four-year volunteers, again with familiarization cruises in the Baltic. On 3 June, she was present at the celebration marking the beginning of construction of the Kaiser Wilhelm Canal. In August, the squadron participated in the fleet maneuvers as II. Division. The winter training cruise began on 1 October; the ships were to have gone into the Mediterranean Sea, but an outbreak of cholera in Italy led to the trip being limited to Cape Verde and the Canary Islands. The squadron arrived back in Wilhelmshaven on 10 April 1888. The normal training routine for the year was interrupted in July, when the Training Squadron and the Maneuver Squadron were sent to accompany the new Kaiser, Wilhelm II, on a visit to Scandinavian ports from 2 to 31 July. This was to be Prinz Adalberts last cruise. =Later career= Prinz Adalbert was worn out from her long overseas deployments by 1888, and after just ten years in active service, she was retired from training duties on 20 September. On 6 May 1890, Prinz Adalbert was stricken from the naval register and thereafter converted into a barracks ship, based in Wilhelmshaven. She served in that capacity until 1907, when she was sold for scrap on 7 June. The ship was broken up later that year in Rotterdam, the Netherlands. Her figurehead is preserved at the Naval Academy M√ºrwik. Curiously, the ship was never renamed, despite the christening of the armored cruiser in 1901.

Michigan Ave. in Jackson, Michigan. The building was built partly in 1895, and was listed on the National Register of Historic Places in 1993. The listing included four contributing buildings. History In 1885, prominent businessmen Samuel B. Collins and Dwight and Henry Smith established the Collins Manufacturing Company to manufacture wagons, carts, surreys, sleighs and buggies. The owners looked for a place to build a factory, and decided on this area, then near the eastern edge of Jackson. Around 1880, the Michigan Central Railroad had constructed a spur in this area, which prompted the construction of a number of nearby industrial buildings. Collins Manufacturing constructed an 1885 factory at this site and began manufacturing. A decade later, the company employed 300‚Äì400 men and was producing 20,000 vehicles per year. However, in 1895, a fire destroyed the factory. Collins Manufacturing immediately rebuilt the same year, constructing a massive U-shaped factory on the site. A few years later, in 1897, the Collins Manufacturing Company was absorbed by another Jackson business, the National Wheel Company. National Wheel relocated its general offices into the former Collins Manufacturing complex site, occupying it until 1908. In 1908, the former Collins factory was purchased by the Jackson Automobile Company, which built cars there. Around this time, a second building was constructed, enclosing the U of the original building. In 1909, Jackson Automobile built another two buildings on the site. The company used the factory until its dissolution in 1922. The site was then used by Cardon-Phonocraft Corporation, who made neon signs, radio tubes and radio/phonograph receivers. In 1930, Cardon-Phonocraft was purchased by the Sparks-Withington Company (later Sparton Corporation), a Jackson-area manufacturer of auto parts and radios. Sparks-Withington occupied the building until the late-1950s. In 1961, the manufacturing complex was purchased by a new owner, who renamed the building the \\"Commercial Exchange Building.\\" Building space is leased to a variety of tenants, who use the space for commercial and manufacturing purposes, as well as warehouse, office, and residential space. Description The Collins Manufacturing-Jackson Automobile Company Complex consists of four adjacent buildings, distributed over most of sixteen lots. The buildings are brick, set back from the street and former railroad spur by about twenty feet. Building A (1895) was the first building constructed in the site. It is a three story, U-shaped red brick building with a six-story tower at the street corner that contains the main entry. The sections have shallow pitched gable roofs. The U shape is composed of sections that run parallel to East Michigan Avenue and Horton Street, with a third perpendicular to Horton. The East Michigan section is 224 feet (27 bays) long, the Horton Street section is 207 feet (26 bays) long, and the last section is 227 feet long. The basement, first and second stories contain double-hung, 1/1 and 6/9 sash window units. The top floor contains fixed nine- pane sash window units. All windows are in segmentally arched enclosures. The tower in the corner is angled to face the street intersection. The entryway was remodeled in 1930, and reflects an Art Deco design. It contains double brass doors with a fixed glass transom above, flanked by limestone panels. Building B () is along the former rail spur, creating a fourth side to the U shape of building A and forming an inner courtyard. This building is also a three story brick structure with a shallow pitched gable roof. It measures 155 feet long (19 bays) on the exterior and 139 feet long (15 bays) along the interior courtyard. Covered ramps lead into the courtyard from Buildings A and B. There are no basement windows, but the first and second stories contain double-hung, 6/9 sash windows, while the third floor contains double-hung 6/6 sash windows. Building C (1909) is located to the south of Building A, and is connected to it through a single-story power house/and loading dock. It is also a three-story brick structure. It is a three-story building, measuring approximately 227 feet (23 bays) long and 65 feet (six bays) along the gable ends. The windows are segmentally arched and contain predominantly 8/12 windows on the first and second floors and 8/8 windows on the third floor. Building D (1909) is also located south of Building C. It is a single-story brick building measuring approximately 60 feet (six bays) by 100 feet (ten bays). It has a slightly-pitched gable roof with a monitor roof running for about 40 feet along the center. All of the window openings are segmentally arched and contain 8/12 sash windows with stone lug sills. The building complex is surrounded by minimal landscaping. Paved parking and service areas run along Horton Street and between the Buildings. A low cement retaining wall borders the parking area.

This was decades after explorers like Robert Gray and Lewis and Clark first arrived in the region, several months before the first newspaper was issued in neighboring California, and several years before the United States formally asserted control of the region by establishing the Oregon Territory. According to historian Johan B. Horner, early pioneers craved newspapers from the east coast, which delivered news of loved ones back home as well as national news, but which arrived as infrequently as twice a year. Horner stated that in the absence of printed material, the community-based art of song drove early Oregon knowledge sharing and patriotism, and drove an intense interest in local newspapers when they did begin to emerge.  Newspapers  Oregon's first newspaper, the Spectator, made use of the first newspaper printing press in the western United States. George Stanley Turnbull, professor of journalism at the University of Oregon School of Journalism and Communication, published his History of Oregon Newspapers in 1939. The book has been described as the most authoritative overview of the field, as recently as 1993. The first printing press in the region, a small Ramage press gifted by a native church in the Sandwich Islands, came to the Waiilatpu mission in Walla Walla in 1839.wikisource:en:Oregon Historical Quarterly/Volume 23/The History of the Oregon Mission Press That press was never used to print newspapers; but in 1844, a group formed in Oregon City with the purpose of establishing a newspaper. The Oregon Printing Association formally declared that the press they acquired was never to be used as a vehicle for partisan politics. (Frances Fuller Victor speculated that the non-partisan rule reflected misgivings about missionary influence among early American Oregon pioneers.) The group secured a press from New York, and produced the first newspaper in the western United States, the Oregon Spectator, in 1846. After going through three editors in the first few months, the Spectator hired George Law Curry as editor. Curry remained in the post until 1848, when he resigned due to a dispute with the Association over his wish to adopt a \\"firm and consistent American tone.\\" The Oregon Territory was formally established in August 1848, with Oregon City‚Äîthe home of the Spectator‚Äîserving as its seat of government for the first three years. The Spectator continued, with changes in ownership, focus, and political focus (becoming a Whig mouthpiece in its later years) until 1855. In 1845, the U.S. Postal Service made the first effort to establish mail communication with Oregon. Other early Oregon papers included the short-lived Free Press, founded by Curry upon his departure from the Spectator, with type purchased from Catholic missionaries and an improvised press; the Western Star, later renamed the Oregon Weekly Times, founded in Milwaukie in 1850 and moving to Portland in 1851. The Weekly Oregonian was the fifth paper in Oregon, and the oldest one still extant. It launched in Portland on December 4, 1850. Its press was purchased in 1852 and used to found the Columbian, the first paper north of the Columbia River. The Statesman was founded in Salem in 1851, in response to the Whig-oriented Oregonian. The first daily paper was Portland's Daily News, begun by S. A. English and W. B. Taylor, April 18, 1859. The \\"first real Republican paper\\" on the west coast was the Oregon City Argus, founded in 1855 and merged into the Statesman in 1863. A number of pro-Southern newspapers in Oregon were suppressed by the federal government in 1862. In the 1860s, telegraph service came to Oregon, initially connecting Portland and other Willamette Valley cities to northern California. Even as late as 1872, according to Oregon news historian George S. Turnbull, there was a shortage of local news published in what he terms the \\"pioneer papers,\\" as compared with his present day (1939). Turnbull identified three reasons: the relative scarcity of important happenings as compared with today; the fact that the demand was still much heavier for the news from \\"outside\\" than for the home news; the earlier reporters had not yet built up the technique of effective reporting. Around the turn of the century, the average lifespan of a newspaper was less than a decade. In the teens, Oregon (along with Washington) banned liquor advertising, prompting at least some out-of-state newspapers to cancel subscriptions in the state. During the Great Depression, when the cost of newsprint was high, the number of newspapers in the state dropped from 278 (1930) to 125 (1940). The number of newspapers in Oregon as a percentage of the population spiked around 1900. Turnbull, who compiled the data, attributed this to \\"a decade of opening up the country, establishing towns and cities, a decade of land and timber notices,\\" and observed that, from 1900 up to the date of his writing (1939), a shrinking number of newspapers provided greater circulation numbers overall. The Oregon Journal was established in 1902, and rivaled the Oregonian in statewide coverage throughout much of its existence. It took positions on a number of policy issues, and was generally considered a Democratic newspaper. The Journal acquired radio stations in the 1930s and '40s, and in 1947 it became the first paper in the country to purchase its own news helicopter. The Journal's circulation peaked the next year. The Oregonian vacated the Oregonian Building, its home of more than 50 years, in 1948, but put itself in financial distress in the construction of its new building; this resulted in the sale of the newspaper to S. I. Newhouse in 1950. Newhouse subsequently bought the Oregon Journal in 1961. The Journal continued as a separate publication (though its Sunday edition ceased) until 1982, when Newhouse merged it with the Oregonian. During a strike which lasted from 1959 to 1964, the Portland Reporter emerged as an alternative to the Oregonian and the Journal. It ceased publication upon the conclusion of the strike. Several locally-owned companies operate groups of newspapers in Oregon. These include the Pamplin Media Group, which launched its flagship Portland Tribune in 2001, simultaneously buying a number of newspapers in the Portland metropolitan area, and later adding newspapers in Central Oregon and the Willamette Valley; the EO Media Group, which runs the East Oregonian, the Daily Astorian, and several other newspapers on the Oregon Coast and southwest Washington, as well as the Capital Press; Eagle Newspapers, which runs newspapers in Hood River, The Dalles, Polk County, and several others in neighboring Washington and Idaho, and previously owned several Oregon newspapers sold to Pamplin in 2013; the Willamette Week of Portland, which also owns weekly newspapers in New Mexico and North Carolina; Rosebud Media, which owns two daily newspapers in Southern Oregon. The Oregonian (Newhouse), the Salem Statesman-Journal (and affiliated papers in Silverton and Stayton) (Gannett), and the Klamath Falls Herald and News (Adams Publishing Group) are owned by national newspaper chains. = Significant events = * Pulitzer: Medford Mail Tribune (1934) local corruption; Llewellyn Banks and the Good Government Congress * Pulitzer: The Oregonian (1957) Teamsters (see Jim Elkins, Dave Beck, McClellan Committee) * In the 1992 United States Senate election in Oregon, the Oregonian was faulted for missing a crucial story, which was then broken by on the east coast by the Washington Post.

Samuel described it as being \\"devoted to Literature, Science, Art, and the Resources of the Pacific Northwest.\\" He promoted the magazine all over the United States and in Europe, and claimed the largest circulation of any Oregon publication. The magazine peaked in 1889, weekly, when it began publishing weekly, with color and tint-block illustrations. Samuel was known for turning down advertising deemed problematic, prior to the emergence of more formal journalism ethics and standards. * Lucy A.

Following an episode in which editorial attacks between newspapers resulted in one Portland newspaper editor being fatally shot by another, a number of editors organized with the purpose of promoting an effective libel law.wikisource:en:History of Oregon Newspapers/Libel and Violence Bear Fruit They achieved that goal, but with some ambivalence from the Portland Bee, whose assistant editor had been sentenced to 15 years for the slaying. The group is not known to have reconvened. The Washington State Press Association hosted an annual conference beginning in the mid-1880s, which attracted Oregon journalists. The Oregon Press Association, now known as the Oregon Newspaper Publishers Association (ONPA), was founded in 1887. Eighteen journalists, primarily from the Willamette Valley, convened at Lincoln City at the urging of editors and publishers of the Roseburg Review, the Yaquina Post, and the Benton Leader; 18 more, including journalists from Eastern Oregon, enrolled by letter.Lincoln County Until 1971, the organization's offices were at the University of Oregon School of Journalism and Communication (SOJC); after that, the offices were moved to Portland and then to Lake Oswego, where they remain as of 2018. ONPA's Hall of Fame The Fourth estate; In 1917, the University of Oregon's journalism school established Oregon Exchanges, a monthly periodical \\"for the newspapermen of the State of Oregon.\\" It was succeeded in 1932 by Oregon Publisher. The Annual Oregon Newspaper Conference is said to have been first held in 1916,Oregon Exchanges v1n1 though another reference suggests it was established as much as a decade prior. At the fourth such conference, in 1922, participants adopted Oregon Code of Ethics for Newspapers, considered the problem of paper cost, proposed a wireless news service, and held concurrent meetings of members of the Associated Press and United Press International. A syndicate, headed by George Putnam, was established to address the problem of newsprint price. The ONPA revised and republished the Code of Ethics in 1951. In 1949 a Houghton-Mifflin textbook, Newsmen at Work, related stories of several reporters who originally hailed from Oregon, including Eric W. Allen (first dean of the University of Oregon School of Journalism), Palmer Hoyt (publisher of the Denver Post), and Charles E. Gratke (of the Christian Science Monitor). Laurence R. Campbell of the University of Oregon was a co- author of the book. Tom McCall * Oregon Shield Law The Payne Award for Ethics in Journalism was established at the SOJC in 1999. During the George Floyd protests in summer 2020, independent journalists covered the events on a nightly basis, in contrast with local media (which sent reporters to some, but not all, of the events) and national media (which generally did not cover the story until federal agents arrived in Portland, about 45 days into the protests).  Education  * University of Oregon School of Journalism and Communication * Student media e.g. Oregon Daily Emerald = General commentary on news media in Oregon = A 2018 Columbia Journalism Review report noted the decline in dedicated statehouse reporters since the mid-2000s, and cited interviews with current and past members of the press corps as giving overall coverage of state politics a low rating. The report noted various new models for gathering state government news, such as a partnership in which the Pamplin Media Group and the East Oregonian news group share two statehouse reporters. * Oregon reporters missed the story of a failing health exchange‚Äîuntil they didn‚Äôt: After a slow start, the state press corps recovers with a bang Trudy Lieberman, CJR May 5, 2014  References   Further reading  * This is in the public domain; the preceding link is to a currently incomplete transcription.

It is located south of Rainy Pass and southeast of Frisco Mountain on the borders of the Stephen Mather Wilderness and North Cascades National Park. Its nearest higher peak is Corteo Peak, to the northwest. Precipitation runoff from Rainy Peak drains into Rainy Lake and tributaries of Bridge Creek. The retreating Lyall Glacier in its north cirque contributes to waterfalls which tumble into Rainy Lake. Climate Rainy Peak is located in the marine west coast climate zone of western North America.Beckey, Fred W. Cascade Alpine Guide, Climbing and High Routes. Seattle, WA: Mountaineers Books, 2008. Most weather fronts originate in the Pacific Ocean, and travel east toward the Cascade Mountains. As fronts approach the North Cascades, they are forced upward by the peaks of the Cascade Range (Orographic lift), causing them to drop their moisture in the form of rain or snowfall onto the Cascades. As a result, the west side of the North Cascades experiences high precipitation, especially during the winter months in the form of snowfall. During winter months, weather is usually cloudy, but, due to high pressure systems over the Pacific Ocean that intensify during summer months, there is often little or no cloud cover during the summer. Because of maritime influence, snow tends to be wet and heavy, resulting in high avalanche danger. Geology The North Cascades feature some of the most rugged topography in the Cascade Range with craggy peaks and ridges and deep glacial valleys. Geological events occurring many years ago created the diverse topography and drastic elevation changes over the Cascade Range leading to the various climate differences.Rainy Peak from Highway 20 The history of the formation of the Cascade Mountains dates back millions of years ago to the late Eocene Epoch. With the North American Plate overriding the Pacific Plate, episodes of volcanic igneous activity persisted. In addition, small fragments of the oceanic and continental lithosphere called terranes created the North Cascades about 50 million years ago. During the Pleistocene period dating back over two million years ago, glaciation advancing and retreating repeatedly scoured the landscape leaving deposits of rock debris. The ‚ÄúU‚Äù-shaped cross section of the river valleys are a result of recent glaciation. Uplift and faulting in combination with glaciation have been the dominant processes which have created the tall peaks and deep valleys of the North Cascades area.

It was built in 1911 on the south shore of Rainy Lake, and preserves its original belt-driven machinery. George Finstad acquired the shop in 1924 and continued to provide maintenance and storage services for fishermen, residents, and vacationers there for just over fifty years. The building was listed on the National Register of Historic Places in 1983 for its local significance in the themes of entertainment/recreation and transportation. It was nominated for its association with the early tourists and summer residents of the Rainy Lake region, a significant factor in Koochiching County's early-20th-century development. With Description Finstad's Auto Marine Shop is a gable-roofed, concrete-block building. Double doors at the front of the building allowed cars to be pulled inside for repairs. At the back of the building, another set of double doors provided access from the lake. The shop featured a belt-driven central machinery system that ran a drill, lathe, and other equipment. Living quarters were on the second floor. History The shop was constructed in 1911 by Jim DiOnne, a gunmaker and automobile dealer. In 1922, DiOnne hired George Finstad, a World War I veteran and native of Buyck, Minnesota. Under DiOnne's guidance, Finstad fine-tuned his machinist and mechanical skills for two years before buying the business in partnership with his brother. He later bought out his brother's share. George Finstad discontinued the shop‚Äôs work on guns and autos to focus on maintaining recreational and commercial fishing boats, as well as selling and repairing boat motors and parts. George's wife Clara handled the shop's bookkeeping. In the years following World War I, outdoor recreation was becoming increasingly popular and accessible. As Minnesota's transportation systems improved and automobiles became more reliable and affordable, wilderness campers and anglers arrived in Ranier by car or on the Duluth, Winnipeg and Pacific Railway. They launched their boats and canoes from the town dock and headed to campsites on the islands and peninsulas scattered throughout American and Canadian waters. In lakes dotted with rocks and strewn with fallen logs, damage to boats and motors was a constant hazard. Finstad's lakeside shop offered convenient, reliable service. Rainy Lake became a fashionable destination in the 1920s and 1930s as a summer escape from the heat and smog of industrial cities across the American Midwest. A number of wealthy tycoons built imposing homes on the lake's islands. The social scene included Minneapolis grain moguls from the Pillsbury and Bell families; William Hapgood, owner of an Indiana cannery; and Major Horace Roberts, president of the Gordon‚ÄìVan Tine Company in Davenport, Iowa, manufacturer of prefabricated homes. Finstad tended to their Chris-Crafts, Hacker-Crafts, and Gar Woods, the wooden speedboats of the era. Larger yachts also sailed Rainy Lake, including the James Ford Bell family's cruiser the Loafden, and Major Roberts' Virginia. The arrival of any new yacht was a civic spectacle in Ranier, with crowds gathering at Finstad's shop to watch the launch. Boats arrived by truck or train, packed in custom-made cradles that protected them during shipping. Finstad loaded the yachts onto his \\"marine railroad\\", a track that shuttled the boats down a two-block slope into Rainy Lake. Each fall Finstad used the marine railway to pull the yachts out of the water. He wrapped them with canvas tarps and stored them on the cradles that had protected them during shipping. Over the winter he repaired, resealed, and readied the boats for relaunching in the spring. Rainy Lake's summer population was lively throughout the 1920s and 1930s, but during World War II the lake grew quiet. Finstad spent the war years maintaining and repairing equipment at the paper mill in nearby International Falls. Following the war, Rainy Lake's wealthy families gradually withdrew from their summer homes. Outhouses and lake-drawn water systems seemed uncomfortably rustic in a prosperous convenience society. Many of the elegant yachts were sold or transported to lakes closer to the Twin Cities or permanent moors in southern states. The Virginia and the Loafden were both moved to Lake Minnetonka. Aluminum and fiberglass boats and canoes gained popularity in the post-war years. The new boats were less expensive and easier to transport and store at home than wooden boats. Although Finstad's winter storage business declined, his Johnson Outboard Motors franchise covered a large territory between Rainy Lake and Kabetogama Lake and provided a steady income. He continued selling and repairing motors and fixing boats until his death in 1975. Clara Finstad kept the shop running until 1992.

These nurses work in a variety of settings such as jails, prisons, and juvenile detention centers. In these correctional settings, nurses are the primary healthcare providers. Roles Correctional facilities vary widely in size and population. Correspondingly, there is a wide range of roles which correctional nurses fill. Some facilities are as large as small cities and include an in-house hospital with inpatient and emergency facilities. Most correctional nurses fall into four categories: Reception Screening, Chronic Care Clinicians, Medication Administration, and Ambulatory Care (often called, \\"sick call\\"). =Intake Screening= Intake Screening is often called, \\"R&R; Screening\\" for, \\"Reception and Release\\". Generally, all inmate new to the institution are evaluated by a nurse prior to being installed into their housing unit. This process has nurses screen inmates for a variety of immediate medical and mental health needs such as alcohol or drug withdrawal, suicide potential, trauma, infectious diseases, and necessity for chronic medications. Custodial officers uses this information in order to decide which part of the facility is appropriate for housing, sometimes initiating movement to another facility if the inmate's medical or mental health needs cannot be met at the initial placement. The nurse performing intake screening generally schedules the inmate for an appointment with a healthcare provider for a detailed history and physical depending on the inmate's needs and presence of chronic diseases. =Chronic Care Clinicians= Inmates with chronic health care concerns (asthma, diabetes, high blood pressure, etc.) generally have regularly scheduled appointments in chronic care clinics. Nurses here provide patient assessments and education about chronic health concerns. Generally, these clinics are overseen by a physician or other mid level provider such as a nurse practitioner. =Medication Administration= Medications, even over- the-counter ones, can be misused in a correctional environment. Most frequently, medications are administered to patients via a medication pass or pill line process. At set, scheduled times during the day, inmates requiring medication either report to a nurse located centrally in a medical unit or receive their doses in their housing unit. In higher security areas, where patients are largely confined to cells and movement is more restricted, the medications are administered at cell front. =Nursing Sick Call= Inmates requiring episodic health care generally follow a process called Sick Call. Inmates request treatment, generally by completing a form (a \\"Sick Call Slip\\") and are seen by a nurse. Most facilities have standardized protocols which allow administration of over-the-counter medications for simple conditions like headache, athlete‚Äôs foot, and constipation without the need for communication with an advanced medical provider such as a physician. An assessment of a more serious condition, or one that falls outside the protocols, would be referred to a medical provider for further evaluation.

The first 10 years of her career are currently obscure. In 1801 she made a voyage to England for the British East India Company (EIC), and then was briefly registered in England. She returned to India to continue to sail as a \\"country ship\\" until she was sold to Portuguese or Spanish owners in 1811. She returned to British ownership circa 1816 and made a second voyage for the EIC, this time from China to England. She returned to English registry and made one voyage to India under a license from the EIC. She then switched to sailing between Liverpool and Quebec and was lost in the Atlantic around 1822. Career =First EIC voyage (1800-1801)= Aurora was at Calcutta on 17 November 1800. Captain Mungo Gilmore sailed her from Kedgeree on 5 April 1801, bound for England. She was St Augustine's Bay on 22 July, reached St Helena on 19 September, and arrived at Deptford on 24 December. Aurora was admitted to the Registry of Great Britain on 4 February 1802. On 13 March Auroras agents paid Messrs. David Scott & Co., or Fairlie, Bonham and Co. ¬£2586 3s for her outfitting for her return voyage to India.

He is considered by historians to be one of the most prominent commercial, financial, and political Ohioans of the first half of the 19th century. Kelley is known as the \\"Father of the Ohio and Erie Canal\\" for his successful legislative attempt to establish the Ohio and Erie Canal. He was one of the canal's first two \\"acting commissioners\\", and oversaw its construction and completion. He was the president of Columbus and Xenia Railroad (completed in 1850) and the Cleveland, Columbus and Cincinnati Railroad (completed in 1851), and pushed for a state charter for the Cleveland, Painesville and Ashtabula Railroad (later known as the Lake Shore and Michigan Southern Railroad). For this, he is known as the architect of Ohio's rail system. As a member of the Canal Commission Fund, he helped save Ohio from bankruptcy in 1841 and 1842. As a state legislator, he led the investigation into and secured the resignation of two Ohio State Treasurers for financial malfeasance, successfully proposed legislation abolishing imprisonment for debt, created the State Bank of Ohio, reformed the state's tax system, and successfully proposed legislation to create the first state oversight of public education. Early years Joshua Stow, who encouraged his nephew Alfred Kelley to emigrate to Ohio Alfred Kelley was born in Middlefield, Connecticut, on November 7, 1789, to Daniel and Jemima ( Stow) Kelley. He was the second of six children (all boys). The Kelleys were of English descent, having lived in Connecticut since at least 1690. The Stows were an important English land-owning family which emigrated to Massachusetts in 1630 and then Connecticut in 1650. Alfred's uncle, Silas Stow, was the land agent for Nicholas Low, who owned the township that later became Lowville, New York. At the urging of Silas Stow, the Kelleys moved to Lowville in the winter of 1798‚Äì1799. Daniel built and operated a gristmill, and Jemima dispensed medication and medical treatment to the settlers in the area. Having attended public school in Middlefield and Lowville, Alfred enrolled at Fairfield Academy in Fairfield, New York, in 1804. Daniel Kelley was appointed a judge of the New York Court of Common Pleas in 1805, and held various other public offices in Lowville and Oneida County. The Kelleys became moderately wealthy. In 1807, Alfred began the study of law under Jonas Pratt, a judge of the New York Supreme Court. Daniel Kelley was increasingly unhappy with the Stow family's liberal religious views, which were beginning to influence his sons. Another of Alfred's uncles, Joshua Stow, was one of the original investors in the Connecticut Land Company. By royal charter, the Connecticut Colony laid claim to most of the lands west of the colony between the 41st and 42nd parallels of north latitude. In 1786, Connecticut ceded all its land claims to the government of the United States in exchange for cancellation of its American Revolutionary War debts. Connecticut retained only those lands known as the Connecticut Western Reserve, an area bounded by Lake Erie on the north, Pennsylvania on the east, and the 41st parallel of north latitude on the south. The Western Reserve extended for exactly to the west, and came to an abrupt halt. On August 3, 1795, the state of Connecticut sold the Western Reserve to the Connecticut Land Company for $1.2 million ($ in dollars). Joshua Stow was a member of the party led by Moses Cleaveland which surveyed the Western Reserve in 1796. Encouraged by his uncle's descriptions of the lush lands of the Western Reserve, Alfred's eldest brother, Datus, traveled to the nascent settlement of Cleveland in early 1810. Although he returned almost immediately, Alfred emigrated to Cleveland in May 1810. He made the journey on horseback, accompanied by Joshua Stow and a medical student, Jared Potter Kirtland. Business and legal career in Cleveland Alfred Kelley was admitted to the bar on November 7, 1810. He was the first lawyer to practice in Cleveland. The local court immediately appointed him prosecuting attorney for Cuyahoga County‚Äîa position he held until 1822. In one of his most notable cases, he prosecuted a slave-hunter for kidnapping in 1820. He won the case. In 1811, Kelley and 16 others formed the first library association in Cuyahoga County. (It lasted about four years.) Largely through the efforts of Kelley, Cleveland was incorporated as a village by the state of Ohio on December 23, 1814. The village's first elections were held on June 1, 1815, and Kelley was elected the first president (mayor) of the village unanimously. Kelley held the position only a few months, resigning on March 19, 1816. House built in Cleveland by Alfred Kelley about 1814. Kelley bought several properties in and around Cleveland. In 1814, he purchased a parcel of land near the mouth of the Cuyahoga River. This property was defined by Water Street (now W. 9th Street) in the east, W. Lakeside Avenue on the south, the Cuyahoga River on the west, and Lake Erie on the north. Kelley constructed a home on this land in 1816. It was only the second brick house in the village of Cleveland. The structure was intended as a residence for his parents, but his mother died before it was completed. Kelley and his wife took up residence there instead, occupying the house until 1827. Kelley and his brothers Datus and Irad formed a general store in January 1815. They erected a brick building on Superior Avenue at the intersection with Bank Street (now W. 6th Street). Kelley also purchased a peninsula on the west bank of the Cuyahoga River, where he established a farm. In 1833, he sold most of this land to local merchant Joel Scranton. The area thereafter became known as \\"Scranton Flats\\" or the \\"Scranton Peninsula\\". Kelley was a major investor in and helped organize the Commercial Bank of Lake Erie (also known as the Commercial Bank of Cleveland) in August 1816. It was the first bank in Cleveland. The bank survived the Panic of 1819, but its finances were in such disarray that it was reorganized in 1820. Kelley was named one of 11 members of the reorganized bank's board of directors, and elected the bank's president in 1823. The bank's charter expired in 1842, its affairs wound up, and its assets distributed to its investors in 1845. The same year that Kelley helped organize the Commercial Bank, he and 13 others formed the Cleveland Pier Company to build a pier into Lake Erie. This structure, located at the mouth of the Cuyahoga River, was erected on sand without pilings and storms soon destroyed it. On March 2, 1817, Kelley met with eight others in Brooklyn Township to form an Episcopal congregation named Trinity Parish. Holding services in the township, Cleveland, and occasionally in the village of Euclid, it was the first Christian church formally organized in Cuyahoga County. Early legislative career In October 1814, Alfred Kelley was elected to the Ohio House of Representatives. He was the youngest member of the state legislature, barely old enough to meet the Ohio constitution's age requirement for holding public office. He was re-elected in 1815 and 1816. Kelley did not seek office in 1817 or 1818, but was elected again to the House in 1819. He served a single term, and did not run for reelection. His legislative accomplishments in this short period were numerous. Kelley successfully proposed that the Ohio House create a finance committee, and the members elected him its first chair. Within weeks, he authored a report which argued for taxation of land according to value and not use. No action was taken on the report; it would not be until 1846 that the state's property tax laws were changed. Kelley was also one of five members of the legislature appointed to a special committee to investigate financial malfeasance by Hiram M. Curry, the Ohio State Treasurer, and his predecessor, William McFarland, both of whom had incurred substantial deficits, embezzled funds, and exhibited incompetence. Curry resigned, the first state official to do so for corruption. Some of Kelley's legislative proposals were less successful. He introduced the first bill barring imprisonment for debt, but it did not pass. He also supported a bill to allow free African Americans to testify in court against white citizens, but this also did not win enactment. Involvement with the Ohio & Erie Canal =Support for a north-south canal in Ohio= In 1816, the state of New York asked the state of Ohio's aid in building the Erie Canal. The request was referred to the Ohio House committee on public works, which was chaired by Kelley. He wrote a report endorsing the project, but the Ohio General Assembly did not act on New York's request. Kelley and others came to believe that a canal linking the Ohio River with Lake Erie would greatly benefit Ohio. They frequently communicated with New York Governor DeWitt Clinton and those building the Erie Canal, and circulated glowing reports about construction progress and the ease with which financing was obtained. They also worked to build a coalition strong enough to overcome parochial opposition to an Ohio canal. In one of his first acts as Governor of Ohio, in December 1818 Ethan Allen Brown proposed construction of a canal between the Ohio River and Lake Erie. A financial panic occurred between March and August 1818 that led to a severe national recession (known as the Panic of 1819) that mitigated against any consideration of a major spending bill like the canal. The recession finally eased in the spring of 1821. =Role on the investigating commission= Micajah Williams Kelley was elected to the Ohio Senate in 1821 and again in 1822. On January 31, 1822, the Ohio General Assembly passed legislation authorizing the appointment of a commission to investigate the feasibility of building the canal proposed by Governor Brown. Five different routes were described in the authorization bill, and the commission was charged with assessing each of them. The seven individuals appointed to the commission were Ethan Allen Brown, newly sworn in on January 3 as a U.S. Senator; Ebenezer Buckingham Jr., who had surveyed much of central Ohio; former Madison County judge Isaac Miner; former U.S. Senator Jeremiah Morrow; former Ohio State Senator and prominent Steubenville attorney Benjamin Tappan; former governor and U.S. Senator Thomas Worthington; and Alfred Kelley. Morrow resigned after being elected governor of Ohio in the fall of 1822, and was replaced by Micajah Williams, a Cincinnati banker, on January 27, 1823. Kelley drafted the report of the investigatory commission. He grasped the need for a statewide (not regional or local) transportation network, and realized that only the state government could be the catalyst for making this improvement. His expansive vision for the state was moderated by a strong commitment to careful planning and strong cost‚Äìbenefit analysis. Kelley and Williams did most of the work of the investigating commission. They examined and surveyed routes, collected data, wrote economic studies, and analyzed construction techniques to determine the best means of building the canal. Kelley traveled to New York to see the kind of construction technology used there, consulted with Erie Canal construction supervisors and state officials, and procured as much information as he could on how the canal was financed. Kelley purchased engineering and surveying instruments from firms on the East Coast, identified engineers available to work on the canal, and obtained a $1,400 ($ in dollars) appropriation for the State Library of Ohio so it could purchase books on canal engineering and construction. This work gave Kelley critical insight into the importance of design and the mastery of detail. The investigating commission issued its report on January 21, 1824. The report recommended that the northern terminus be near the mouth of the Cuyahoga River. The canal route followed the Cuyahoga from Cleveland to Akron, the Tuscarawas River from Akron through Dover to Coshocton, the Muskingum River from Coshocton to Zanesville, and the Licking River from Zanesville to Newark. The proposed route then proceeded overland from Newark south to Licking Summit Reservoir (now Buckeye Lake) and then overland again to Baltimore and Carroll before turning northwest toward Canal Winchester. Thereafter, the report recommended that the canal generally follow Big Walnut Creek to Columbus, and then the Scioto River south from Columbus through Chillicothe to Portsmouth on the Ohio River. The investigating commission also recommended simultaneous construction of the Miami and Erie Canal from Cincinnati at least as far as Dayton. Opponents of the canal accused Kelley and other investigating commissioners of recommending a route along which they already owned land, enriching themselves. These accusations appear unfounded. The commission had surveyed the other routes and extensively documented their unfeasibility, and historian Harry N. Schreiber has observed that there is no evidence in the commission's papers or Kelley's private correspondence to suggest any impropriety. Nor did the report actually designate Cleveland as the northern terminus. Instead, it required the canal to be built along the route with the most water. To placate its critics, the investigating commission had the route between Sandusky and Columbus resurveyed by a new engineer. Once more, the investigating committee rejected this route as lacking enough water to sustain the canal. The investigating commission issued its updated report on January 8, 1825. =Canal commissioner= Map of the Ohio and Erie Canal (in red) The Ohio General Assembly approved legislation on February 4, 1825, authorizing construction of the Ohio & Erie Canal. The same day, the legislature adopted a bill to reconstitute the investigating commission as the Canal Commission, with authority to oversee financing and construction of the canal. Canal Commission members included Kelley; newcomer Nathaniel Beasley, a former surveyor and soldier who had served several terms in both chambers of the General Assembly; newcomer John Johnston, a former Indian agent with extensive landholdings in Miami County; Miner; Tappan; Williams; and Worthington. The Canal Commission picked two of their members, Kelley and Williams, to be \\"acting commissioners\\", individuals with direct supervision over canal construction. The two men located the actual canal route, negotiated for and purchased land, wrote engineering specifications for the canal bed and locks, advertised for and awarded contracts, purchased supplies, and supervised the engineers and surveyors in the employ of the state who worked on the canal. The raising of funds through the issuance of bonds and stock was the legal responsibility of a separate Canal Fund Commission, but in practice the Canal Fund Commission delegated most of its power to Kelley and Williams. Kelley and Williams accomplished two major tasks in 1825. The first was to purchase or obtain a right of way to the land needed for the canal. The Canal Commission did not formally select the northern route of the canal until May 1825, and until that happened Kelley and Williams had to solicit land along both the Black and Cuyahoga rivers. They were highly successful, and managed to have significant amount of land donated (rather than sold). Kelley himself donated about a third of his remaining Scranton Flats land for the project. Kelley and Williams also established a large, professional bureaucracy to construct and finance the canal. In the United States in the early 1800s, state governments employed only a few dozen people. Kelley and Williams made recommendations to the full commission regarding organizational structure, staffing, and the duties of each job. The commission invariably followed their guidance, and in so doing allowed Kelley and Williams to create the first large bureaucracy in Ohio history. Work on the Ohio & Erie Canal commenced on December 10, 1825. Ohio was underdeveloped and starved for capital, and there was not nearly enough private money in the state to make even a small domestic bond sale successful. Kelley and Williams had to spend money judiciously. Rather than market all or a large portion of the necessary bonds immediately, the Canal Fund Commission decided to float only $400,000 ($ in dollars) worth of bonds. These bonds were offered at a high rate of interest to attract buyers. The hope was that, as segments of the canal became operational and substantial toll income was generated, the bonds would become more attractive and the interest rate on future offerings would necessarily fall. Work on the Cleveland-to-Akron segment began first. Kelley fought against constant pressure from politicians and the press to spread finances and workforce thin and work on all segments of the canal at the same time. The \\"acting commissioners\\" also had to overcome unexpected labor shortages and contractors who abandoned their work. Kelley's topographical map of Ohio Through his hands-on work on the canal, Kelley became so well acquainted with the geography of Ohio that he authored the first comprehensive topographical map of the state in 1826. The other canal commissioners agreed to allow it to be published. Kelley tried to have the map published by a printer in the state of Delaware, but was embarrassed to discover that the Ohio General Assembly claimed copyright of his document. The Cleveland-to- Akron portion of the canal opened in July 1827, ahead of schedule. The high quality work, lack of corruption, and budget-conscious construction impressed investors, making it easier to sell canal bonds in the future. The responsibility for setting toll rates on the new canal also fell to Kelley and Williams. Impressed with the efficiency and speed of Ohio canal construction, the federal government agreed donate public land to the state with the stipulation that this land be sold to aid canal construction. Almost were donated along the route of the Miami Extension Canal, almost along the Wabash and Erie Canal, and another throughout the state for other canals. In 1832, the Ohio & Erie Canal was finished, except for the final lock at Portsmouth. Work on the Miami and Erie Canal was also complete, except for the lock connecting the Great Miami and Ohio Rivers at Cincinnati. Kelley contracted malaria in his first years of work on the canal, and in 1832 his health was so poor that canal commission meetings had to be held at his home. In their 1832 annual report to the state legislature, Kelley and Williams proposed that the Canal Commission be abolished and a new commission, consisting entirely of politically neutral engineers, be established to oversee future construction and operation. This was one of only a handful of recommendations the two made which the General Assembly refused to adopt. With work on both canals completed in 1833, and in poor health, Kelley resigned from the Canal Commission on January 24, 1834 (effective March 1). For his role in authorizing and construction the Ohio and Erie Canal, the press and civic leaders in Ohio lauded him as the \\"father of the Ohio and Erie Canal\\". Return to the state legislature The Alfred Kelley House in 1958, a few years before it was demolished. In October 1830, Alfred Kelley relocated from Cleveland to Columbus after his wife, Mary, pleaded with him to move the family so they could spend more time together. Kelley, one of the wealthiest men in Columbus, purchased of land on E. Broad Street. Beginning in 1837, he began construction on a large Greek Revival home at 282 East Broad Street. Kelley also made large real estate purchases in Franklin County and in Cleveland after leaving the Canal Commission. Kelley, Moylen Northrup, and John Kerr purchased a large parcel in what became downtown Columbus. This land was platted and subdivided in 1838 and incorporated into the city of Columbus, making Kelley a substantial profit. =Becoming a Whig= In the early 1830s, Kelley left the Democratic-Republican Party and joined the Whig Party. This switch in political affiliations began in the mid-1810s when Kelley became a supporter of Henry Clay, the Democratic-Republican Speaker of the United States House of Representatives. Clay had proposed the \\"American System\\", an economic program consisting of high tariffs, strong banking regulation, and federal subsidies for infrastructure improvements like roads and canals. The Democratic-Republican Party was deeply divided over these proposals, however. One faction, led by Andrew Jackson, harbored a deep suspicion of the federal government. These \\"Jacksonians\\" viewed strong government as a threat to individual freedom, favored the farmer over the businessman, and believed that government programs (such as banking reform and regulation, infrastructure development, public education, and high tariffs) benefited the rich at the expense of the common man. The other faction, led by Clay and John Quincy Adams, favored high tariffs, believing they would prevent specie from going overseas and thus allow banks to expand capital and credit. Coupled with a strong and activist central government and system of federally-financed infrastructure improvement, these \\"National Republicans\\" hoped to expand the economy, empower producers (businessmen and farmers), and bring new and improved products to markets (consumers). Clay ran against Jackson for the presidency in 1824, but John Quincy Adams won the nation's highest office after the election was thrown into the House for resolution. The Democratic- Republican Party collapsed, with Jackson forming a new Democratic Party in 1828. Rejecting the label \\"National Republican\\" as too closely tied to northeastern business interests, Clay formed the Whig Party in 1834. Neither the national Democratic Party (which dismissed state intervention in the economy and a stronger banking system) nor the Ohio Democratic Party (which rejected prioritization of canal construction projects, distrusted the opinions of professionals and experts, and wished to retain a politicized canal board) held any interest for Kelley. Kelley was elected chairman of the Whig State Central Committee of Ohio in 1840. His prominence in the party made him a frequent target of political invective. =Return to the Ohio House= Kelley sought and won election to the Ohio House again in 1836. Columbus and Franklin County were Democratic strongholds, however, and Democratic- controlled newspapers accused Kelley of making immorally high profits from his banking business, speculating on real estate, and enriching himself by ensuring that the Ohio & Erie Canal passed near his land. As evidence of his wealth, the newspapers pointed to the \\"palace\\" Kelley was building in Columbus. These attacks were largely ignored by voters, who elected Kelley by a wide margin even though he was now a Whig. During the 1836-1837 legislative term, Kelley sponsored a resolution instructing the House Committee on Schools and School Lands to report a bill authorizing appointment of a state school commissioner. The resolution passed and the reported bill became law, creating the modern Ohio public school system. Kelley sought and won re-election to the Ohio House in 1837. The previous session, the Ohio General Assembly had enacted legislation (known colloquially as the \\"Loan Law\\") which required the state to match, on a dollar-for-dollar basis, any private investment in canals, railroads, or turnpikes so long as these ventures met certain requirements. The state was rapidly issuing bonds to comply with the law, despite the ill-considered or parochial nature of these projects. Kelley's bill to repeal the Loan Law failed. He was successful on another front, when his 17-year legislative effort to abolish imprisonment for debt finally won the approval of the legislature. Bank investor and executive =Using the canal fund to build banking relationships= Kelley built extensive business and personal relationships with bankers in Ohio and New York City while a Canal Commissioner. To help Ohio banks, Kelley required that canal workers be paid in bank scrip. This ensured that bank scrip circulated more widely, helping to expand a bank's market and making each bank's scrip more widely accepted by the public. =Banking roles= Kelley's close association with the banks made him a leading figure in the Ohio banking community by the mid-1830s. In April 1832, Kelley and eight others sought additional investment to help expand the Commercial Bank of Lake Erie. Most of the capital was provided by Henry W. Dwight and his wealthy family of bankers and investors. The Commercial Bank of Lake Erie was Cleveland's only bank from 1832 to 1834, and afterward only one of two. Until the expiration of its charter in 1843, it provided most of the scrip and bills of credit in northern Ohio, provided the underpinning for nearly all of Cleveland's business community, and was one of only a few major banks where the state and federal government deposited specie. Kelley pushed the bank to become involved with the Ohio & Erie Canal. It received specie payments from Eastern bond investors and disbursed scrip and specie on behalf of the Canal Fund Commission. Kelley also became a major investor in the Franklin Bank of Columbus (probably no later than June 1836). This institution, founded in 1816, became a depository for canal funds and disbursed specie and scrip on behalf of the Canal Commission, and Kelley was later elected to the bank's board of directors. Through Micajah Williams, Kelley also became a stockholder in the Franklin Bank of Cincinnati. Ohio Life Insurance and Trust Co. banknote from 1839 or 1840 Kelley's biggest role as a banker was his participation as an organizer and trustee of the Ohio Life Insurance and Trust Company. The Trust Co., as it was more commonly known, was conceived by Connecticut and New York financier Isaac Bronson, his son Arthur Bronson, and New York lawyer and prominent Jacksonian Charles Butler (brother of U.S. Attorney General Benjamin Franklin Butler). They had previously incorporated the New York Life Insurance and Trust Company, which gave wealthy Easterners the chance to invest in a bank whose sole business was to make real estate mortgages in western New York. It made large profits. They now conceived of a similar organization for Ohio, and gathered a secretive group of initial investors (\\"the associates\\"). At this period in American history, nearly all states refused to allow \\"foreign\\" (out-of-state) corporations to do business within their borders. The associates recruited Elisha Whittlesey and Micajah T. Williams to be \\"front men\\" for them, so that the project would appear to be conceived by and for the benefit of Ohioans. The Bronsons and a few of the other associates wrote the Trust Co. charter. Although Democrats attacked the Trust Co. as a \\"moneyed monster\\", a majority of Ohio state legislators were deeply concerned that a capital liquidity crisis was about to emerge in Ohio. To alleviate the problem, on February 12, 1834, the Ohio General Assembly chartered 10 new private banks with total a capitalization of $4.4 million ($ in dollars). Among them was the Trust Co., which accounted for $2 million ($ in dollars) of that capital. Although Trust Co. stock was supposed to be sold to the public, the associates ensured that all the stock was sold in advance to their most trusted friends and business partners. Fully 75 percent of the stock was owned by wealthy New Englanders and large New York City investment companies. The remaining stock was sold to prominent Ohioans such as Jacob Burnet, David T. Disney, John H. Groesbeck, Simon Perkins, Elisha Whittlesey, Micajah Williams, and Alfred Kelley. The Bronsons, who secured a large majority of shares via proxy from the eastern shareholders, hand-picked the board of directors, who were elected on September 30, 1834. The charter required that at least two-thirds of the board be Ohioans, which required great care on the part of the Bronsons to ensure that the board did not include risk-takers or self-dealers. Among the Ohioans on the board were Jacob Burnet, David T. Disney, Calvin Pease, Simon Perkins, Benjamin Tappan, Allen Trimble, Joseph Vance, Elisha Whittlesey, Micajah Williams, and Alfred Kelley. =Dilemma of 1839= The Trust Co. was highly respected at the outset. As expected, it served as a depository institution for the state of Ohio, receiving and disbursing scrip and specie. It also did a large amount of business with private banks in addition to its real estate mortgage business. The Panic of 1837 significantly damaged the financial standing of the Trust Co. In October 1839, the company stopped making payment in specie. This placed its charter at risk, for state law allowed the company to suspend payment of specie only for 30 days. As a director of the bank, Kelley faced a dilemma: The Trust Co. held more than $1 million ($ in dollars) in canal and state bonds. The only way the company could survive was if it sold these bonds. However, this risked driving down the price of the bonds the Canal Fund Commission was trying to sell at the same time and could imperil work on the many Ohio & Erie branch canals under construction as well as other state- backed canals. Kelley decided to risk further work on the canal system and advocated saving the bank by placing the bonds on the market. He believed that the Trust Co. was \\"too big to fail\\"; there was no way state legislature would retaliate by rescinding the bank's charter because this would cause too much damage to Ohio's economy. Disaster was averted when the bond market, recovering from the Panic of 1837, absorbed the sale of bonds sold by the Trust Co. and the Canal Fund. Canal Fund Commission and the Panic of 1837 Kelley returned to state employment when he was appointed a Canal Fund Commissioner on March 30, 1841. He did not relinquish his seat on the Trust Co. board of directors. Kelley became a commissioner as the Canal Fund and Ohio state finances were in crisis. =Causes of the Canal Fund crisis= A political cartoon caricatures Andrew Jackson and others for starving the American economy of cash, causing the Panic of 1837 One distal cause of the financial crisis was the extensive amount of canal construction the state had embarked on beginning in 1833. The General Assembly authorized construction of the Miami Canal Extension (from Dayton to Lake Erie) in 1833, construction of the Wabash and Erie Canal in 1834, and more than 15 feeder and branch canals and sidecuts. Unlike the prioritized building program adopted by Kelley and Williams, the state pursued all these construction projects simultaneously. This greatly increased the Canal Fund Commission's need to raise money. Moreover, while the cost of these projects was originally estimated at $4.5 million ($ in dollars), actual costs were much closer to $10 million ($ in dollars). Another distal cause of the crisis was the Loan Law of 1837. By 1839, state debt had soared to $12 million ($ in dollars), of which $2.5 million was Loan Law debt and $8.5 million was attributable to work on the six new feeder and branch canals. The debt reached $14.8 million ($ in dollars) in 1840, and another $2.5 million was needed to complete the work. The debt reached $17 million ($ in dollars) in 1841. The proximate cause of the financial crisis was the Panic of 1837. The Canal Fund had great difficulty selling bonds in 1837, and had so little money on hand that (except for those working on the Wabash & Erie Canal) it stopped paying contractors in December 1837. Additionally, canal revenues were not high enough to pay the interest on canal construction debt. In order to make interest payments in early 1838, the Canal Fund floated even more bonds and sought loans from banks. By early 1840, there was talk in the state legislature and among politicians and other civic leaders of repudiating a portion of the state debt. The Canal Fund was able to make its $281,000 ($ in dollars) interest payment in June 1840 only after the state (in March) approved $300,000 in new borrowing expressly to meet the interest payment. The Canal Fund was nearly out of cash again by November 1840. The fund commissioners asked the Ohio State Auditor for an advance of $200,000 ($ in dollars), which was refused. =Canal Fund financial crisis of 1841= In early 1841, the State Auditor warned the commissioners that $400,000 ($ in dollars) would be needed pay the January 1842 interest payment. Instead of taking action to put the Canal Fund on a sound financial footing, the General Assembly asked the Canal Commission to expand construction and seek temporary loans to pay contractors and interest. Kelley and the other Canal Fund commissioners declined to borrow the money. Kelley discovered that New York City banks were unwilling to loan the Canal Fund Commission any money except on a short-term basis, and bonds could be sold only at a steep 25 percent discount of the par value and at high guaranteed interest rate (6 percent). The Canal Fund Commission decided to seek loans from Ohio banks instead. Despite advertising widely, only two banks responded in April 1841. The first of these was the Bank of Chillicothe, which agreed to lend the Canal Fund $581,000 ($ in dollars) at 6 percent interest. The Bank of Franklin, on whose board of directors Kelley still sat, agreed to loan the Canal Fund $500,000 ($ in dollars) at 6 percent interest. The loans were dispersed in banknotes, paper money similar to scrip but which was redeemed by the bank's own specie (rather than federal specie on deposit). Contractors, suppliers, and others accepted these banknotes only at a discount, and even then many doubted they could be redeemed. But the commissioners had no choice. Later in 1841, a third institution, the Bank of Wooster, agreed to loan the Canal Fund $199,355 ($ in dollars) at 6 percent, the entire principal due in one year. These loans were not enough to cover essential costs, however, and the Canal Fund was forced to borrow $275,000 ($ in dollars) in high-interest, very short-term loans from New York City banks. All of these loans proved critical to helping the Canal Fund survive. The Canal Fund was able to make its interest payments and pay contractors about $580,000 ($ in dollars). Without them, the canal fund would have had been all but bankrupt and would have stopped paying contractors for the entire year. The overall financial situation was still poor, however. The Canal Fund's total debt rose to $15.573 million ($ in dollars) in 1841, and there was $1.6 million ($ in dollars) in non-contractor current and accumulated liabilities. The Canal Fund commissioners were able to eliminate some of the current and accumulated liability by selling $1.3 million ($ in dollars) in bonds at an average discount of about one-third (netting just $858,000). By November 1841, the Canal Fund had a balance of $1,393 ($ in dollars), with interest due in January 1842 of $400,000 ($ in dollars) and a $300,000 ($ in dollars) temporary loan due shortly thereafter. When General Assembly's legislative session opened in early December, there was immense pressure to repudiate all or a portion of the state's debt. To help prevent this, Kelley used his influence with the Ohio Life and Trust Co. (on whose board he still sat). Although it had no authorization to do so, the commission gave the Trust Co. $300,000 ($ in dollars) in bonds in late 1841 and early 1842 as collateral for a $200,000 ($ in dollars) loan. (The commission received the loan funds in March 1842.) Kelley and the other fund commissioners also illegally withdrew in late 1841 several large sums from the general tax fund of the Ohio State Treasury so that the Canal Fund Commission could make bond interest payments in January 1842. Although the Ohio State Auditor accused the Canal Fund Commission of fraud, their actions avoided certain default. According to historian Harry N. Scheiber, Kelley likely approved the highly irregular advances because he was convinced that revenues from the soon-to-be-finished canals would bring in substantial revenues a few months later that would allow these advances to be repaid swiftly. =Canal Fund financial crisis of 1842= A Canal Fund Commission stock certificate issued in 1842 The Canal Fund's financial crisis continued through 1842, even though the depression was lifting and the Hocking Canal, Walhonding Canal, Warren County Canal, and the Muskingum Improvement (a branch canal and a series of locks and dams designed to improve navigability on the Muskingum River) were all completed (which not only meant the need for less borrowing but the beginning of tax and toll revenues from these works). Canal contractors were owed $1.4 million ($ in dollars) by February 1842, but only two payments were made to them during following 10 months. Beginning in March 1842, the Canal Fund began issuing checks to non-contractor businesses to which it owed money. The checks were redeemable only in state bonds, and were rarely cashed because banks and businesses discounted them 30 to 50 percent below par. Completion of these four canals was possible because work did not actually stop, despite the lack of payment to contractors. Some contractors declared bankruptcy and quit working, but the unfinished canals could not be abandoned because rain, snow, floods, and other factors would damage them. To complete the works and leave them in a state where they could be left idle, the Canal Commission was forced to hire new contractors at much higher rates of pay. Some contractors avoided bankruptcy by taking out loans from banks in Michigan. These banks paid in banknotes which proved nearly worthless, but in many cases it was enough to keep the contractor solvent. Other contractors kept working without pay. They believed the state would eventually meet its obligations and perhaps even compensate them extra for being patient. Putting the Canal Fund Commission on a solid financial footing was paramount, and Kelley and the other Canal Fund commissioners heavily lobbied the Ohio General Assembly to act. It finally did so in March 1842 by repealing the Loan Law. With the Canal Fund still in deficit, the legislation also authorized the commissioners to sell more than $500,000 ($ in dollars) in bonds so the fund could repay the Chillicothe and Franklin banks and to issue $500,000 in scrip so that contractors could be paid at least a portion of what they were owed. To ensure that this scrip was accepted, the legislature used its Wabash and Erie Canal lands as collateral. Notably, the law required the Canal Fund to issue scrip only in $100 ($ in dollars) denominations. Kelley and the other fund commissioners, however, turned a blind eye when Ohio banks issued scrip in smaller denominations to meet the needs of contractors and workers. The General Assembly also adopted legislation that suspended work on all branch and feeder canals and sidecuts, except for final work on the Wabash and Erie Canal and on those canals already under contract. About $1.5 million ($ in dollars) was needed to fund this work. In the past, Canal Fund commissioners themselves traveled around the state and to New York City to sell these bonds. Now, however, the legislature required these bonds to be sold through brokers. The sale was successful, although the bonds had to pay 7 percent interest. The General Assembly also agreed to the Canal Fund Commission's proposal to sell canal lands. The sale of these lands had essentially ceased in 1836. A new law, adopted on March 8, 1842, permitted the sale of canal land at $2.50 ($ in dollars) an acre or its appraised value, whichever was higher. The value of some Miami Extension Canal lands, which had sharply risen in value, was reduced by law to $4.00 ($ in dollars) an acre. The law required that land be purchased only in \\"cash\\", which meant specie, banknotes from specie-paying banks, or state-issued scrip (essentially allowing contractors, paid in state-issued scrip, to redeem the scrip for valuable land). Bonds still needed to be sold to raise revenue for the rest of 1842 and early 1843, and in April 1842 Kelley went to New York City to sell the bonds authorized by the legislature. Initially, he met with agents of overseas bond-holders to see if they were interested. They were not. Kelley then offered to insure the interest payments on the bonds, with his personal real estate as collateral for the insurance. When the agents still hesitated, Kelley signed a note in which he personally agreed to pay $10,000 ($ in dollars) of the July 1842 interest payment. The agents accepted the note, bought the insurance, and agreed to purchase the bonds he was selling. To further boost confidence, Kelley also offered to accept canal bonds at par value in payment for any property he had for sale. Since the state's bonds were selling well below par value at the time, Kelley took considerable risk in making the offer. Kelley was forced to conceal how he had personally guaranteed the bonds and bond interest payments. If word had gotten out, it might have induced panic selling of canal fund bonds. Kelley also secured a $250,000 ($ in dollars) loan from New York City banks, but once more only after personally guaranteeing the payment of interest. Kelley traveled to the United Kingdom in the spring of 1842 to sell canal bonds to cover the July 1842 and January 1843 interest payments on existing bonds. Kelley personally conducted negotiations with Baring Brothers & Co. in attempt to sell bonds. Through the Ohio Life and Trust Co., Kelley had a pre-existing relationship with Barings: Baring Brothers had sold canal bonds on behalf of the Trust Company in Europe, and Barings itself owned some canal bonds. Kelley sold Baring Brothers $400,000 ($ in dollars) of canal bonds at a 40 percent discount, netting $240,000 ($ in dollars). When word of the bond sale became known in Ohio, Kelley's political opponents accused him of selling out the state in order to enrich his wealthy British business associates. =End of the Canal Fund financial crisis= In February 1843, Kelley once more relied on his banking friends and colleagues to secure the canal fund's solvency. Kelley and the other canal fund commissioners traveled to New York City to sell $1.5 million ($ in dollars) in bonds. They were unable to sell the bonds at first, as investors expected Ohio to default on its debt. The commissioners then wrote and jointly published a statement outlining the state's financial situation, the financial status of the canal fund, and the progress on the Canal Commission's public works. By once more pledging the 1836 surplus and raising the interest rate on the bonds from 6 to 7 percent, they were able to sell all the securities. The 1843 bond sale greatly stabilized the finances of the Canal Fund Commission and the state of Ohio. Canal Fund Commission checks, which were trading (but still not being cashed) at a 40 to 50 percent discount, now rose almost to par. Contractors began to be paid in specie- paying bank notes. With the crisis over, the Ohio General Assembly reorganized the Canal Fund Commission in March 1843, and Kelley resigned from the board after the law passed. Despite the attacks on Kelley during the crisis, conservative Democrats joined with Whigs in the General Assembly to pass a resolution retroactively approving every measure he had taken to avoid default by the Canal Fund Commission. He was widely known as \\"savior of the state honor\\" for successfully helping the state to avoid default. According to historian Harry N. Scheiber, it is highly doubtful that Ohio would have avoided default and bankruptcy had Kelley and the other canal fund commissioners not had exceptionally close ties to Ohio and New York bankers. Second return to the state legislature Kelley's role in the Canal Fund Commission financial crisis left him with strong views about the state's banking system. His experience on the fund commission had not changed his belief in strong, centralized state government. However, rather than heavily regulate Ohio's banks, he now sought to strengthen state incentives for banks to engage in better decision-making. Like-minded individuals persuaded him to run for Ohio Senate in 1844 in order to pass banking reform legislation. Kelley ran for and won office to the state senate in 1844 and 1845. During the 1844-1845 legislative session, Kelley was elected chairman of Ohio Senate's committee on currency and was a member of its committee on finance. On January 7, 1845, he introduced a bill to establish a State Bank of Ohio. The state bank was authorized to establish branches throughout the state to provide new capital to local banks and the public. The capital provided to local banks carried with it new requirements designed to strengthen and reform financial practices, thus lessening the likelihood of future bank failures. This, in turn, would encourage outside investment in Ohio. The second part of the bill concerned the issuance of new bank charters and the re-issuing of charters to banks whose charters expired. All state-chartered banks henceforth would be required to participate in a form of deposit insurance, limits were set on the rate of interest which could be charged (to avoid usury), and the size of loans given to any individual or firm were restricted (to help rein in risk- taking and reduce the likelihood that a single large loan default could ruin the bank). Although strongly attacked by Democrats, Kelley's banking bill was adopted by the legislature almost unchanged. The Kelley bank bill ended much banking chaos and confusion in Ohio. As predicted, the banking legislation increased capital in Ohio at a time when it was sorely needed, and helped end much of the conflict of interest and mismanagement in the state's private banks. Kelley also sought to reform the state tax code. He authored a comprehensive report on the tax system which the finance committee submitted to the Ohio Senate on February 17, 1845. As he had 26 years earlier, Kelley proposed taxing property according to its value, not its use. This time he was successful: The bill passed the General Assembly on March 2, 1846, and the parameters of the bill governed Ohio's tax code for more than a century. Early involvement with railroads Even as Kelley was at work on the Ohio and Erie Canal, railroads were beginning to be built in Ohio. The first of these was the Erie and Kalamazoo Railroad on April 22, 1833. It was chartered by the Michigan Territory at a time when the border between the states of Michigan and Ohio was not settled. A portion of the railroad ended up within the borders of Ohio after the settlement of the Toledo War in 1836. Interest in railroads increased significantly after the Panic of 1837 ended. The state canal system was nearly overwhelmed with traffic, and investors saw railroads as a means of augmenting the canal system. Eastern investors were particularly interested in creating a system of integrated railroads that would extend from the Iowa Territory to the Atlantic Ocean. Kelley first became involved with a railroad in 1836 when the Muskingum and Columbus Railroad was chartered by the Ohio General Assembly. This company intended to build a line from Zanesville west through the Licking Valley to Columbus. One of nine original incorporators of the company, Kelley became involved with the scheme because of the extensive construction management and financial knowledge he had gained while building the Ohio & Erie Canal. As with many early railroads, this one was never built. =Columbus and Xenia Railroad= A Columbus & Xenia Railroad stock certificate issued in 1849, bearing Alfred Kelley's signature The Columbus and Xenia Railroad (C&X;) was chartered by the state of Ohio on March 12, 1844. The Little Miami Railroad, chartered some years earlier, was already under construction and would like Cincinnati and Xenia, Ohio, in 1845. The C&X; would link Xenia to Columbus‚Äîcreating the first rail link between Ohio's two largest cities. The incorporators of the C&X; had difficulty raising funds and initiating construction, and no survey of the route had been made by February 1847. Kelley agreed to become president of the railroad in 1847 at a salary of $500 ($ in dollars) a year. With private investors unwilling to take a risk on the line, Kelley convinced city and county governments along the route to sell bonds and use the money to invest in the C&X.; With this money in hand, Kelley was able to convince East Coast financiers that the railroad was a sound investment. He personally went to New York City to sell C&X; bonds, and raised enough money to not only complete construction of the railroad but also to buy locomotives and rolling stock to equip it. Kelley also accompanied engineer Sylvester Medbery as he traveled the line's likely routes, the two men essentially surveying them together. Kelley then personally approved the route of the C&X.; For the track, Kelley traveled to the United Kingdom and contracted with Sir John Guest & Co. of Wales for T rails. The C&X; was one of the first railroads in Ohio to used T rails instead of strap rails. The of rails did not arrive in Cleveland until July 1849, delaying the laying of track until the fall. Work on the road began in October 1847, just months after Kelley assumed the line's presidency. The laying of track was complete on either February 19 or February 21, 1850, and regular service began on February 27. The C&X; began generating substantial profits, and Kelley personally negotiated an agreement with the Little Miami Railroad which ensured an excellent working relationship between the two lines for many years. Kelley stepped down as the C&X;'s president some time between May 4, 1852 and April 21, 1853. Cleveland, Columbus and Cincinnati Railroad =Election as president of the line= The Cleveland, Columbus and Cincinnati Railroad (CC&C;) was chartered by the state of Ohio on March 14, 1836, and authorized to construct a railroad from Cleveland to Cincinnati, passing through the cities of Columbus and Wilmington. Fundraising failed, no construction occurred, and the charter lapsed. In 1845, a group of Cleveland business and civic leaders succeeded in persuading the Ohio General Assembly to revive the charter on March 12, 1845. Once more, the company failed to raise funds for the venture; Financier Edmund Dwight, representing the wealthy Dwight family of Massachusetts and New York, visited the city in August 1847. The Dwights and Kelleys had invested in the Commercial Bank of Lake Erie, and the Dwight family was strongly interested in Ohio railroads. Edmund Dwight told the board that improved investor confidence was needed to raise funds, and this required that the board seek a new leader who could ensure the efficient and timely construction of a well-built railroad. The president of the CC&C; resigned and Alfred Kelley and Leonard Case Jr. were elected to the board of directors. Kelley was appointed president on August 13. =Raising funds and constructing the road= Kelley immediately began speaking with his colleagues in the banking and finance fields, and by early September 1847 indicated to the board that a favorable response had been found among investors in New York City. Kelley ordered construction of of track near Cleveland to test new construction methods and railroad technology. To ensure that the new charter did not lapse, on September 30, 1847, Kelley and other members of the board of directors went to Cleveland's Scranton Flats and ceremoniously filled a wheelbarrow with earth to symbolize the start of construction. The company hired an old man to work five days a week, continuously digging this trench, in order to prove to the state that construction was \\"ongoing\\". Kelley also began to raise substantial funds. He began his tenure as president by urging the board of directors (composed of wealthy Ohioans) to show faith in the business by purchasing company bonds. By September 15, 1847, the board had invested $100,000 ($ in dollars) in the CC&C.; Kelley heavily promoted the railroad in Cleveland and by April 15, 1848, investors there had purchased $100,000 ($ in dollars) in company bonds with pledges to purchase another $100,000 when the company asked. Kelley traveled to Cleveland in early August 1848, delivering a rousing one-hour speech which led listeners to purchase $73,000 ($ in dollars) more in stock. Kelley ordered the railroad's route resurveyed, a process which began in October 1847 and concluded about the end of January 1848. Engineers issued a new report to the board on August 19, 1848. The contract for construction was awarded to the firm of Stone, Harbach, and Witt on November 1. Harbach was one of the two engineers who had resurveyed the line in late 1847 and early 1848. Amasa Stone had worked with Harbach and another railroad engineer, Stillman Witt, while building railroad bridges in New England, and Kelley knew Stone well from his visits selling bonds back east. Kelley reached out to Stone, Harbach, and Witt, and asked them to build the railroad. The three men formed a company in late 1848 to do so, and agreed to take a portion of their pay in the form of railroad stock. Kelley personally traveled to the United Kingdom in 1848 where he again contracted with Sir John Guest & Co. for T rails. The of rail purchased was sufficient to lay half the road. Some 3,000 to 4,000 men were at work on the line at the end of July, completing the grading, constructing the track bed, and beginning to lay rail. With the cost of the main line appearing to hold steady at $2.5 million ($ in dollars), Kelley personally went to New York City in July 1849 and sold another $400,000 ($ in dollars) in bonds to keep the work going. He sold another $100,000 ($ in dollars) in bonds to Ohio investors the same month. The first of CC&C; track, between Cleveland and Wellington, Ohio, opened about September 1, 1849. A train carrying Kelley and several board members toured the completed of track in mid-March 1850. Alfred Kelley was reelected president of the Cleveland, Columbus and Cincinnati Railroad in January 1850. With the company in need of more rail, Kelley traveled to New York City in late May, where he sold enough bonds to pay for the necessary iron. He then made a second trip to Britain to purchase more rail. He returned in mid-June having purchased another of rail. The CC&C; reached Shelby, Ohio, on November 12, 1850.; =Celebratory completion trip= The Cleveland, Columbus and Cincinnati Railroad was completed on February 18, 1851. At 7 A.M. on February 18, Alfred Kelley and a party consisting of the railroad's directors, Columbus mayor Lorenzo English, and a number of other business and civic leaders departed on a special northbound train from Columbus. Kelley and Mayor English each laid a final rail on the line, and then Kelley drove the last spike at noon. The party reboarded the train and, after a salutary cannonade, proceeded to Cleveland. The train gave three whistles as it entered the city, which was returned by a three-cannon salute. The CC&C; began freight and passenger operations on February 21, 1851. To celebrate the event, Kelley invited Ohio Governor Reuben Wood, the entire Ohio General Assembly, the mayors and city councils of Cincinnati and Columbus, and numerous other local politicians and business leaders to travel at the railroad's expense on a four-day excursion trip from Columbus to Cleveland and back. The excursion train and its 425 passengers left Columbus on February 21. The following day, the excursionists watched a parade in Cleveland's Public Square. Although several politicians and local leaders spoke, Kelley declined to address the crowd. The excursion train returned to Columbus on February 24. The completion of the Cleveland, Columbus and Cincinnati Railroad created the first direct rail link between Cleveland and Cincinnati. Cleveland, Painesville and Ashtabula Railroad =Election as first president of the railroad= In 1847, a group of businessmen from Ashtabula, Cuyahoga, and Lake counties undertook an effort to build Cleveland's railroad link to the east, and on February 18, 1848, they received a state charter for the Cleveland, Painesville and Ashtabula Railroad (CP&A;). The line had authority to build a railroad from Cleveland to some point on the Ohio-Pennsylvania border. The stockholders met for the first time on August 1, 1849, and elected Herman B. Ely, George G. Gillett, Alfred Kelley, Tappan Lake, David R. Paige, Peleg P. Sanford, and Samuel L. Selden to the initial board of directors. Kelley was elected president, but due to other pressing business had to temporarily step aside. Herman Ely was named acting president until such time as Kelley could take up his duties. Frederick Harbach surveyed the route for the CP&A; in late 1849 and early 1850. In his report, issued at end of March 1850, he proposed two routes. Kelley reviewed both and chose the northern route. To construct the road, Kelley once more turned to the firm of Harbach, Stone & Witt, which won the CP&A; construction contract on July 26, 1850. Financing for the road was never an issue, and construction proceeded swiftly. Regular trains began running on the line on November 20, 1851. =Role in creating the Franklin Canal Company railroad= The CP&A; did not have the legal authority to build a railroad in Pennsylvania. The railroad soon discovered that the Franklin Canal Company (FCC) had been empowered by the Pennsylvania state legislature to build a railroad in April 1849. Railroad historian Anthony Churella says the CP&A;'s New York City-based financial backers first realized the value of the FCC's charter. However, Kelley biographer James L. Bates and Cleveland historian Harland Hatcher both claim it was Alfred Kelley who did so. On July 5, 1849, the FCC issued $500,000 ($ in dollars) in stock, with the CP&A; purchasing $448,500 of it. In addition to building north to the city of Erie, Pennsylvania, the FCC also intended to build a branch line along the shore of Lake Erie from Erie west to the Ohio- Pennsylvania border. Completion of this branch line (the \\"Lake Shore Division\\") would connect the CP&A; with the Erie and North East Railroad (E&NE;) and bring the FCC significant income with which to build its main line. On January 10, 1850, Kelley agreed to connect the CP&A; with the FCC at the Ohio-Pennsylvania border. This was superseded by a new agreement on August 26, 1850, under which the CP&A; not only committed to connecting with the FCC but also to building and operating its lakeshore line. Kelley was able to commit to these agreements because the CC&C; was generating large revenues. Kelley used these revenues to subsidize the construction of other important railroads in Ohio, which in turn gave him leverage to forge operating agreements with the CC&C; once they opened. The CC&C; was completed in February 1851, and Alfred Kelley took up the CP&A; presidency the following month. As the cost of building the FCC rose, the canal company decided to sell bonds to raise the necessary funds. Kelley offered to have the CP&A; guarantee the bonds. The CP&A; began construction on the Lake Shore Division shortly after November 1851 and the line was completed 12 months later. =Role in the Erie Gauge War= People in Pennsylvania were angry that the FCC's track gauge was the same as that of connecting railroads in New York and Ohio. This meant passengers and freight did not have to be transshipped at Erie, and threatened to allow the railroads to largely bypass Erie. The Erie Gauge War erupted, in which state and local authorities as well as mobs attempted to prevent completion of the Lake Shore Division. The Attorney General of Pennsylvania filed suit on October 12, 1852, to enjoin the Franklin Canal Company from opening its nearly-completed railroad. This threatened the CP&A;'s investment, as construction had only reached as far west as Crooked Creek. Although the Supreme Court of Pennsylvania overturned the injunction in January 1853, the court interpreted the FCC's charter to preclude the construction of any railroad within of the Ohio border. Alarmed that the Lake Shore Division might not reach the state border, Alfred Kelley personally purchased the right of way. Pennsylvania law permitted private individuals to construct \\"lateral railroads\\" to connect their factories, farms, mines, or other real estate to state-chartered railroads. Kelley initially proposed that several less- prominent directors of and investors in the CP&A; and FCC purchase the land and build this lateral railroad with funds provided by the CP&A;, but none were willing to take the risk. Kelley went forward with the project on his own, using funds secretly provided by the CP&A.; Kelley personally visited landowners along the route, making friends with them and buying the land he needed. In some cases, he was required to purchase entire farms. He also won passage of local ordinances permitting his lateral railroad to cross public roads. Kelley then had the line graded and constructed, and conveyed the lateral railroad to the FCC. Kelley's actions did not end the Gauge War. By April 1853, the situation had so deteriorated that Kelley considered bypassing Erie altogether and connecting the CP&A; to existing railroad lines which routed traffic through Pittsburgh. The people of Erie were further alarmed when the CP&A; took over operation of the FCC's Lake Shore Division on December 1, 1853. On December 7, mobs tore up the FCC's track, demolished several of its bridges, and assaulted railroad officials. Kelley threatened to raise a private militia to protect FCC property if the state could or would not do so. Rioters tore up railroad track again in January 1854.; Tensions died down considerably when, on January 28, 1854, the Pennsylvania General Assembly enacted legislation repealing the FCC's charter. Pennsylvania Governor William Bigler seized the FCC on January 30, and appointed William F. Packer as the company's superintendent. The CP&A; continued to operate the FCC on behalf of the state, forwarding 47 percent of all revenues generated by the Lake Shore Division to the state treasury. =Resignation= To further placate certain Pennsylvanians, Kelley resigned as president of the CP&A; in February 1854, and was replaced by William Case.; The state of Pennsylvania had no interest in running a railroad, and in May 1854 the Pennsylvania General Assembly enacted new legislation permitting the CP&A; to build a line from the Ohio-Pennsylvania border east to Erie. The law allowed the CP&A; to purchase the FCC, provided that the CP&A; invested in a nearby Pennsylvania railroad. The CP&A;, which already owned the FCC, assumed title to the Lake Shore Division. With the CP&A; link between Cleveland and Erie (and the east coast) complete, Kelley negotiated a contract under which the CC&C; and CP&A; jointly operated the CP&A;'s line. Third return to the state legislature =Health problems= Kelley took a leave of absence from the CC&C; presidency in early October 1851. He resigned his position at the railroad about May 24, 1853, and was replaced by Henry Payne (who had unofficially been acting president for some time already). Kelley retained his directorships on the CC&C; and CP&A; until his death. Having long suffered from malaria contracted while working on canal system, Kelley was in extremely poor health after six years leading three railroads. After stepping down as CP&A; president, he went to Europe for an extended vacation, not returning until early May 1854. =Final legislative term= Grave of Alfred Kelley at Green Lawn Cemtery in Columbus, Ohio After returning from Europe, Kelley was offered the presidency of several railroads on Ohio. He declined all opportunities, feeling that these railroads were parochial efforts that would not benefit the state was a whole. The deteriorating national political situation led Kelley to re-enter politics. The U.S. Supreme Court heard oral argument in the case of Dred Scott v. Sandford, , in February 1856. Deeply alarmed by the worsening political discourse concerning slavery and worried by Ohio's deteriorating state finances, Kelley once more decided to seek election to the Ohio General Assembly. He sought and won a seat in the Ohio Senate in 1856, becoming the oldest legislator in either branch of the General Assembly in the 1856‚Äì1857 term. Kelley led an investigation into whether Ohio could impose due process requirements on the federal Fugitive Slave Act of 1850, but this led to no legislation being introduced. As chair of the Senate finance committee, he forced an investigation into Ohio State Treasurer William Harvey Gibson. Extensive evidence of check kiting, conflict of interest, embezzlement, and fraud were uncovered, and Gibson resigned in disgrace. Kelley sponsored two successful bills which placed tighter controls on the state treasurer, but had few other legislative accomplishments that term. Personal life Kelley married Mary Seymour Welles of Lowville, New York, on either August 25 or August 27, 1816. He purchased a one-horse chaise in Lowville, and drove to Buffalo in it. Their schooner for Cleveland was not yet ready to sail, so they traveled to Niagara Falls. Upon their return, they discovered the ship had sailed, so they rode in the chaise from Buffalo to Cleveland. Theirs was the first carriage ever seen in Cleveland. The Kelleys had had 11 children: Maria (1818-1887), Jane (1820-1897), Charlotte (1822-1828), Edward (1824-1825), Adelaide (June‚ÄìSeptember 1826), Henry (1828-1830), Helen (April 3, 1831), Frank (1834-1838), Annie (1836-1888), Alfred (1839-1909), and Katherine (1841-1918). Death and legacy For portions of 1856, Kelley was severely ill and confined to home. His health noticeably declined during his last term in the state legislature, and he was once more confined to his home several times in 1857. Physicians could not determine the nature of Kelley's illness, even as he lost weight and his energy declined. From 1857 to 1859, he became increasingly paralyzed. He was feeble for the last few months before his death, and fell into a coma on November 28. He died at his home in Columbus on December 2, 1859. Kelley was interred at Green Lawn Cemetery in Columbus, Ohio. His estate was worth $250,000 ($ in dollars). Historians consider Kelley one of the most dominant commercial, financial, and political people in the state of Ohio in the first half of the 1800s. He is widely considered the \\"architect\\" of Ohio's canal and railroad systems.

The municipality existed from 1926 until its dissolution in 1964. The municipality included the southern part of what is now Harstad Municipality on the eastern coast of the island of Hinn√∏ya as well as some smaller islands in the V√•gsfjorden. The administrative centre was actually located in the town of Harstad, immediately north of Sandtorg (although Harstad was not in Sandtorg municipality). Sandtorg Church, the main church for the municipality was in the village of S√∏rvika. History Since the early 13th century, there has been a trading post at Sandtorgholmen (where the village of Sandtorg is located). This location became more important in the late 18th century when pilot services were added for foreign and local ships. The trading post continued to be a focal point of Sandtorg until 1945 when the Norwegian Army's communication services took over the facilities after the German occupation (1940‚Äì1945). The army returned Sandtorgholmen to civilian use in the 1990s. Today, the Sandtorgholmen trading post features a hotel with a harbor restaurant and meeting facilities. The municipality of Sandtorg was established on 1 July 1926, when the municipality of Trondenes was divided into three separate municipalities. The areas east of the Tjeldsundet strait and east of the V√•gsfjorden (population: 2,443) became the municipality of Sk√•nland and the areas on the west side of the Tjeldsundet and V√•gsfjorden were split two ways. The southern part (population: 4,224) became the municipality of Sandtorg and the northern part (population: 3,429) remained as the municipality of Trondenes. During the 1960s, there were many municipal mergers across Norway due to the work of the Schei Committee. On 1 January 1964, Trondenes municipality (population: 6,567), Sandtorg municipality (population: 7,512), the town of Harstad (population: 3,808) were merged to form a new, larger Harstad Municipality. Bjarne Berg-S√¶ther (born 1919) was a significant leader in Sandtorg during the 20th century. He was the mayor of Sandtorg from 1948 until 1964 when it was merged with Harstad. He was also the first mayor of the newly merged municipality of Harstad, which occurred in 1964 (and therefore also the last mayor of Sandtorg). During his 20 years as mayor after World War II, boat building factories at R√∏dskj√¶ret were added, lighted ski tracks, and a community cultural house was built. Many of these additions caused Sandtorg's population to almost double. Today, Sandtorg is a community in transition from farming, fishing, and meat production to a commuter community with a significant part of the population working in Harstad about away. Name The municipality is named after the old Sandtorg farm (Old Norse: Sand√æorghom). The first element comes from the word sandr which means \\"sandy area\\" and the second element means \\"square\\". The name was frequently used historically for farms where there was a marketplace. Government =Municipal council= The municipal council of Sandtorg was made up of 35 representatives that were elected to four year terms.

The Palazzo di Sangro di Casacalenda is an 18th-century aristocratic palace located across a pizza from the church of San Domenico Maggiore in central Naples, region of Campania, Italy. The East flank of the facade faces the facade of the church of Sant'Angelo a Nilo. History The initial design was made reputedly by Cosimo Fanzago in the late 16th century. In 1754-1762, the architects Mario Giofffredo and later Luigi Vanvitelli refurbished the palace as we mainly see it today, for the Duchess Marianna de Sangro di Casacalenda. It is said that during this construction, the Byzantine-era church of Santa Maria della Rotonda was demolished. That church putatively had been erected by Emperor Constantine atop a temple of Vesta. The columns of the temple are now in use in the courtyard. The design of monumental pilasters of the top floors of the facade are attributed to Mario Gioffredo. In 1831, the palace was sold by the Sangro family to the Del Balzo family In 1922, as part of the urban renewal of Naples and to widen Via Mezzocannone, the easternmost bay of the palace was demolished, requiring the removal of frescoes from this part of the piano nobile. The frescoes were relocated to the Museum of Capodimonte.Palazzi di Napoli website, citing Da I palazzi di Napoli by A.

He is Chairman of Arctic 21, a network of organizations focused on communicating issues of Arctic climate change to policy-makers and the general public. Beginning in the late 1970s, he played a key role in raising awareness of the risks of climate change for United States policy-makers.  Early life and education  Pomerance grew up in Greenwich, Connecticut. He graduated from Cornell University in 1968, with a B.A. in History.  Career  After graduating from university, Pomerance served as a VISTA volunteer. He was the operating chief at Friends of the Earth for four years until 1984. From 1986 to 1993, he served as a Senior Associate at the World Resources Institute. In 1993, he was appointed Deputy Assistant Secretary of State for Environment and Development under U.S. president Bill Clinton. He left the department in 1999 and founded a non-profit, Climate Policy Center. He is now a consultant for Rethink Energy Florida and the National Academy's Polar Research Board.  Climate change activism  = History = Pomerance first became interested in climate change after reading a 1978 EPA report, \\"Environmental Assessment of Coal Liquefaction: Annual Report\\". The report's prediction, which \\"warns that continued use of fossil fuels as a primary energy source for more than 20 to 30 more years could result in increased atmospheric levels of carbon dioxide. The greenhouse effect and associate global temperature increase and resulting climate changes could, according to NAS be both 'significant and damaging.'\\" led to Pomerance contacting a number of scientists for answers. He teamed up with scientist Gordon MacDonald and began scheduling meetings with government officials to discuss the issue of climate change. Their meeting with top White House scientist, Frank Press, prompted a National Academy of Sciences study, \\"Carbon Dioxide and Climate: A Scientific Assessment\\", informally known as the Charney report, the first formally recognized report on the impacts of CO2 on the climate. In 1981, Pomerance met with atmospheric physicist James Hansen. He chose Hansen to speak as a witness at the Senate hearings, where then-House Representative Al Gore also spoke. However, these and other scientists' warnings that action needed to be taken were ignored by the Reagan-led government. Dismayed by the lack of attention and seriousness that Americans had for the warming planet, Pomerance resigned from Friends of the Earth in 1984. Pomerance joined the World Resources Institute in 1986 and continued to attempt to fight for climate change policy. He convinced a senator to hold the June 10 and 11, 1986 hearings on ‚ÄúOzone Depletion, the Greenhouse Effect, and Climate Change\\", with Hansen again speaking. Though previously unsuccessful, Hansen's 1988 testimonies on the effects of climate change are now regarded as a turning point in the public's awareness of the issue. Press coverage of the event was much more extensive, resulting in higher public awareness of the issue. These hearings resulted in, a year later, Reagan announcing his support for The Montreal Protocol, an international agreement aimed at stopping the ozone layer problem. In 1989, at the World Conference on the Changing Atmosphere, Pomerance suggested proposing a concrete goal. His suggestion was \\"a 20 percent reduction in carbon emissions by 2000.\\" This goal became internationally known as a target for emission reductions. = Legacy = Pomerance is now considered an \\"Unsung Hero of the Climate Wars\\". His lobbying efforts in the 1980s were the subject of a 2018 New York Times article entitled \\"Losing Earth: The Decade We Almost Stopped Climate Change\\". The article brought significant attention to his past work.  Personal life  Pomerance is married and has three children. He has lived in Washington, D.C. since 1975.

History of Mount Washington A view of Mount Washington from Bigbee Street In the early history of Pittsburgh, Mount Washington was known as Coal Hill, but Coal Hill was actually on the south bank of the Monongahela River.1787 PLAN OF THE LOTS LAID OUT AT PITTSBURG AND THE COAL HILL Easy access to the Pittsburgh coal seam's outcrop near the base of Mt. Washington allowed several mines to operate there. Also, rock was quarried from the hill. Gray sandstone, for example, was quarried at Coal Hill for the second Allegheny County Courthouse. By 1876, the name had been changed to Mount Washington,OUTLINE PLAN OF ALLEGHENY COUNTY and a year later, the view of the City of Pittsburgh was first drawn from Mt. Washington.1877 BIRDSEYE VIEW OF PITTSBURGH Many photos of the Pittsburgh skyline are from Mt. Washington, due to the elevation of the hill overlooking the river valley and Downtown Pittsburgh below.1908 Panoramic photo Inclines P. & L.E. Ry. Pittsburgh and Lake Erie Railroad station and the Monongahela Incline on Mt. Washington, c. 1905 The original switchback trails that wound up the steep slopes of Mt. Washington were barely passable to a team of horses pulling a loaded wagon. Immigrants, predominantly from Germany, settled Mount Washington by the early 19th century and worked in the plants adjacent to the Monongahela River. They became weary of climbing steep footpaths and steps to their homes, from the river valley, after work. They remembered the standseilbahns (inclines) of their former country, and proposals were advanced to construct one or more of them along Coal Hill. The Monongahela Incline was the first of these to be built in 1869‚Äì1870. The Duquesne Incline opened to the public in May 1877, and it was one of four inclined planes climbing Mount Washington that carried passengers and freight to the residential area that had spread along the top of the bluff. As the hilltop communities were virtually inaccessible by any other means, many of Pittsburgh's inclines carried horses and wagons as well as foot passengers. All carried some light freight. A third incline, the Castle Shannon Incline, which closed in 1964, also served the hilltop community on Mt. Washington with a lower station at the corner of East Carson Street and Arlington Avenue, just east of the present Station Square Transit Station. This incline was closed by its owner, the Pittsburgh Railways Company, just prior to all of their streetcar and bus routes being taken over by the Port Authority. The Monongahela and Duquesne Inclines allow access to Mt. Washington's overlook of the downtown area of Pittsburgh. Tourists marvel at the view while riding two of only a few remaining inclines in the country. The inclines remain the best way for thousands of Pittsburghers on Mt. Washington to get to their jobs, entertainment and shopping in downtown Pittsburgh and Station Square. Pittsburgh sign In the 1930s, a huge neon billboard sign, 226 feet wide and 30 feet high, was erected on the Mount Washington hillside near the Duquesne Incline tracks. Its earliest known advertisers were Iron City Beer, Clark's Teaberry Gum and WTAE-TV Channel 4. In 1967, the Alcoa aluminum company took over the sign and changed its plain background into a gray-and-white mosaic font pattern that spelled out \\"PITTSBURGH\\" when seen in the daytime, giving the sign new popularity. Alcoa became the sign's most well-known advertiser, remaining for the next 25 years. In 1992, Miles Laboratories moved their U.S. headquarters from Elkhart, Indiana to Pittsburgh and became the sign's new advertiser. In April 1995, the Miles brand name was absorbed by its parent company, Bayer AG and the sign was changed to feature the Bayer name and its circular cross logo. Bayer AG declined to renew their lease on the sign in 2014. As of May 2015, Lamar Advertising and the City of Pittsburgh were in disagreement over the proper use and maintenance responsibilities of the sign. In June 2016, Lamar Advertising erected a new vinyl sign over the old neon sign for the Sprint Corporation; a gold banner with black letters reading \\"Pittsburgh WINS with Black & Yellow\\". Many Pittsburgh natives reacted negatively to the wording \\"black & yellow\\" as opposed to the city's traditional \\"black & gold\\" moniker. On April 30, 2019, with Sprint's lease on the sign expired by that time, Lamar mounted a new sign bearing an American flag representing the National Flag Foundation, a nonprofit organization based in Pittsburgh. The future of the long-rusted Pittsburgh sign and its neon lighting is unknown as there are no current plans for renovation. Beneath Mt. Washington The first tunnel through Mt. Washington was the Pittsburgh and Castle Shannon Tunnel, which began life as a coal mine but was extended through from the Mt. Washington Coal Incline to Saw Mill Run in 1861. This was followed by the Mount Washington Transit Tunnel for Pittsburgh Railways and Wabash Tunnel for the Wabash Pittsburgh Terminal Railway, both in opening in 1904. The former continues in use by Pittsburgh Light Rail and the latter as a High Occupancy Vehicle tunnel. The Liberty Tunnel through Mt. Washington opened in 1928. The Fort Pitt Tunnel beneath and through Mt. Washington opened September 1, 1960.

The aircraft was purchased in early December 1947, was given RI-003 register number, and was used as a military and civil air transport facility. The effort to purchase this aircraft started with the establishment of the Panitia Pusat Pengumpul Emas (Central Gold Collection Committee) by Mohammad Hatta, Indonesia's first vice president, in Bukittinggi, West Sumatra, on 27 September 1947. The committee aimed at collecting public donations to buy aircraft, in the framework of resistance to Operation Product (now known in Indonesia as the First Dutch Military Aggression), an offensive by Netherlands forces against Indonesian-held territory. The committee was led by A. Karim, a director of the Bank Negara (State Bank). The West Sumatra community collected 14 kg of gold donations, which were used to buy an Avro Anson aircraft in Thailand. The aircraft was previously owned by Paul H. Keegan, an Australian citizen and a former RAF airman. The aircraft was then flown by Keegan himself to the Gadut airfield in Bukittinggi. At the end of December 1947, Air Commodore Iswahyudi and Air Commodore Halim Perdanakusuma flew the aircraft past the Dutch blockade to garner support from Singapore and Thailand. The two Indonesians then loaded war equipment and medicine in Songkhla, Thailand, but on their way home through Singapore, the aircraft crashed in Tanjung Hantu, Perak Malaya, killing both of its crew. The aircraft pieces were scattered in the sea of Labuhan Bilik, between Tanjung Hantu, Malaya and Teluk Senagih, North Sumatra. Perdanakusuma's body was found, but Iswahyudi's was missing.

He was a two-sport athlete at the Arkansas State Teachers College, playing guard for the football team and pitching for the baseball team. He also played professional baseball for parts of at least three seasons, including a stint at Jonesboro during which he pitched seven consecutive shutouts and 67 scoreless innings. Appleby spent most of his career as a coach. He was the head baseball coach at Henderson State University (1949‚Äì1951), Millikin University (1952‚Äì1953), and the University of Toledo (1954‚Äì1957). He was also the head football coach at Millikin in 1951 and 1952 and an assistant coach at Henderson and Toledo. He later served as the head football coach at Fenton High School in suburban Chicago from 1959 to 1985. Early years Appleby grew up in University City, Missouri, a suburb of St. Louis. He attended University City High School where he was a member of the football, basketball and baseball teams. He received all-county honors at fullback. He attended the Maryville Northwest Missouri College for one semester before being drafted. He served in the Air Corps during World War II. He played football as a halfback for service teams at Kearns Army Air Base and Keasler Field in Mississippi. He later served in Germany where he was a player-coach for the Second Armored Division regimental football team.(two-column profile of Appleby) After the war, he attended Arkansas State Teachers College (now the University of Central Arkansas) where he played guard for the football team and was a pitcher for the baseball team. He threw a no-hitter for Arkansas State in 1947 and received his bachelor's degree there in 1949. Professional baseball and college coaching In July 1947, Appleby signed to play professional baseball for the Memphis Chicks. He appeared in seven games for the Chicks during the 1947 season. He also played for Jonesboro in the Northeast Pro League, pitching seven consecutive shutout and 67 scoreless innings. From 1949 to 1951, Appleby was the football line coach and baseball coach at Henderson State Teachers College (now Henderson State University) in Arkadelphia, Arkansas. In July 1951, he was hired by Millikin University as the head coach of the school's football and baseball teams. He served as the baseball coach for the 1952 and 1953 seasons. His teams won College Conference of Illinois (CCI) championships in both football and baseball. In March 1953, Appleby resigned from Millikin and returned to professional baseball. He appeared in 14 games for the Decatur Commodores during the 1953 season. In July 1953, Appleby accepted a position as head baseball coach and freshman football coach at the University of Toledo in Toledo, Ohio. He was the head baseball coach at Toledo through the 1957 season. After three years as Toledo's freshman football coach, he became the backfield coach for Toledo's varsity football team in 1956. Athletes mentored by Appleby at Toledo included Mel Triplett who later played eight years in the NFL. In January 1957, Toledo fired its athletic director as well as Appleby and several other athletic department personnel. At the time of his departure, his 29 wins ranked second among Toledo's baseball coaches, trailing only David V. Connelly. High school coaching and later years After leaving Toledo, Appleby worked for many years as a high school football coach, beginning at Evergreen Park High School near Chicago. His Evergreen Park teams won a championship in baseball and finished second in football. In September 1959, he was hired as the head football coach, assistant baseball coach, and teacher at Fenton High School in suburban Chicago. He remained the head coach at Fenton for more than 25 years. Interviewed in 1968, Appleby noted that the task of coaching high school athletes was more challenging: \\"You have tremendous pressure in college -- an entirely different atmosphere -- but you also get boys who are more skilled. Actually, I don't think you have to do as much coaching in college.\\" After retiring from Fenton High School, Appleby taught handicapped skiing in Colorado from 1985 to 2004. He died in July 2006 in Norman, Oklahoma, at age 83.

Roger Crosskey was born in Croydon to Harold and Elfreda n√©e Ward. His mother died of cancer when he was sixteen and after that spent a lot of his time outdoors collecting insects including butterflies and diving beetles. He studied at Whitgift School and his first publication was in 1951. He studied ensign wasps (Aulacidae and Gasteruptiidae) for his master's degree from the University of London. He married Margaret Eileen (\\"Peggy\\") n√©e Godfrey with whom he studied at college. Peggy was also an entomologist and worked alongside him throughout his career. Crosskey joined as an entomologist in the service of the Government of Northern Nigeria to study sleeping sickness in 1951. He also studied onchocerciasis vectors and helped in monitoring and examining the effectiveness of control measures. Along with John B. Davies, he conducted studies on blackflies in the Galma valley. The work conducted over six years involved catching nearly 13,000 flies over an area of 1000 square miles and dissecting 1200 flies to check for larvae of Onchocerca volvulus. They found nearly 20% of the flies being infected in the rainy season and formulated a DDT spraying scheme to reduce the transmission of the parasite. The scheme has come to be called the Crosskey-Davies Experiment of 1954‚Äì1960. He returned from Africa to London in 1959 and began to work as a dipterologist and specialized in the Tachinidae. Roger illustrated most of his publications by himself. Crosskey revamped the classification of the Simuliidae. Crosskey and Graham B. White used the biogeographical designation of \\"Afrotropical Region\\" as a more specific term than the previously used terms such as \\"Ethiopian region\\" or \\"Sub-Saharan Africa\\". He began to work along with Curtis Sabrosky and became a key member of the ICZN code committee. The tachinid genera Crosskeya and Crosskeyellum are named in his honour as are nearly a dozen species of flies with the epithet crosskeyi. Crosskey himself described a couple of hundred species and established a few new genera while revising the dipteran groups that he worked on.

He is regarded as a driving force behind the founding of Namsos, which was established as a \\"small seaport\\" ( or ) in 1845. Havig also served several terms as a Storting representative. Havig was born in Vemundvik, the son of the bailiff Johan Havig, and he performed his father's duties while he was ill. Already at the age of 12, he was employed at the stipendiary magistrate (sorenskriver) Elias Frederik Hetting's office, and he became a formal assistant at his father's bailiff's office at the age of 16. He never received formal schooling, but was taught by his father (who was trained as a teacher), the attorney S√∏ren Reiersen Thorn√¶s, and the dean Peter Christian Boye, and he is said to have been particularly talented in mathematics, astronomy, and French. Havig took over the bailiff's office from his father at the age of 18 in 1826, and he was in charge of the Namsos and Fosnes bailiff districts until he retired in 1878, after 52 years of service. Havig also operated Havika, his family farm in Vemundvik outside of Namsos. He married his cousin Anne Margrethe Guldvig, to whom their son Johannes Bernhard Havig (1838‚Äì1893) was born. After passage of the laws introducing local government (formannskapslovene) in 1837, Havig quickly gained trust as a member of the Vemundvik rural district council (1838‚Äì1873), but his position as a bailiff forbade him from becoming the mayor or a member of the municipal executive board. He was elected to the Storting to represent Nordre Trondhjem county from 1839 to 1841 (at the age of 31), and again from 1845 to 1847. He was a member of the Storting's protocol committee, but he exercised the most influence through the contacts he created with the capital. In order to simplify timber exports, he worked to construct a small seaport with a customs office in Namdalen. In 1845, Namsos was founded at the mouth of the Namsen River, and Havig even contributed to surveying and distributing the plots of land. Havig also served as settlement commissioner (forlikskommiss√¶r) in Overhalla from 1856 to 1862 and in Namsos from 1862 to 1875, as director and treasurer for the Namsos Savings Bank (Namsos Sparebank) from 1842 to 1875, and as the managing director of the public library. Havig was awarded the Medal for Outstanding Civic Service in 1876. Lensmann Havigs gate (Bailiff Havig Street) in Namsos is named after him.

Membership  The Boston Library Consortium is an academic consortium of nineteen institutions: fifteen in Massachusetts, two in Connecticut, one in New Hampshire, and one in Rhode Island. Member institutions are a mix of liberal arts colleges, research universities, public and private institutions, and special libraries. New members may join the BLC if they are based in the northeastern United States, preferably New England, and their application is approved by a two-thirds vote of the Board of Directors. The BLC is funded through membership dues. As of 2017, institutional membership fees ranged from $20,000 to $24,000 per year, plus an equivalent one-time fee. Affiliate members contributed a flat $6,500 per year. Members Current members include the following institutions: * Bentley University * Boston College * Boston University * Brandeis University * Marine Biological Laboratory and Woods Hole Oceanographic Institution * Northeastern University * State Library of Massachusetts * Tufts University * University of Connecticut * University of Massachusetts Amherst * University of Massachusetts Dartmouth * University of Massachusetts Lowell * University of Massachusetts Medical School * University of New Hampshire * University of Rhode Island * Wellesley College * Wesleyan University * Williams College History The BLC was founded in 1970 and officially incorporated in 1977, consisting originally of five institutions. It had grown to twelve institutions by 1993, seventeen by 2014, and nineteen by 2019. Former members include Boston Public Library and Massachusetts Institute of Technology (MIT). The BLC is administered by an Executive Director and governed by a Board of Directors. Each member library of the BLC is represented on the Board by the chief librarian of its principle library. Per its bylaws, the BLC's purpose is \\"to share human and information resources so that the collective strengths support and advance the research and learning of the members‚Äô constituents.\\"  Activities  Major BLC areas of activity include resource sharing and professional development. The BLC runs a \\"BLC Leads\\" program to foster leadership development among member library staff, a reciprocal borrowing agreement through which faculty and other patrons affiliated with any member library can borrow materials for free from other member libraries, a shared virtual catalog and rapid delivery of materials between libraries to fulfill patron requests, cooperative purchasing of scholarly resources, and hosting of communities of interest to foster discussion and collaboration among member libraries. Past activities included cooperative collecting and sharing of materials in select subject areas, such as women's studies. In 2007, the BLC partnered with the Open Content Alliance (OCA) to digitize BLC member libraries' out-of-copyright print collections and make them freely available online via the Internet Archive. To fund the effort, the BLC pledged more than $845,000 over two years. This partnership made the BLC the first large-scale consortium to embark on a self-funded digitization project with the OCA. In 2014, the BLC, along with the Orbis Cascade Alliance and other groups, pushed back against a publisher price increase on e-books, which they feared would negatively impact academic library budgets. Since 2014, the BLC has administered the Eastern Academic Scholars' Trust (EAST), a collective collections initiative across sixty-five academic libraries throughout the eastern United States. EAST member libraries have committed to retaining over six million volumes. EAST's goal is \\"preserving the print scholarly record and ensuring its availability for scholars, students and faculty.\\" Under BLC auspices, the EAST initiative received startup grants totaling $1.5 million from the Andrew W.

In accordance with its war plan, it ignored Russia and moved first against France‚Äìdeclaring war on August 3 and sending its main armies through Belgium to attack Paris from the north. The German invasion of Belgium caused Britain to declare war on Germany on August 4. Most of the main parties were now at war. In October 1914, Turkey joined the war on Germany's side, becoming part of the Central Powers. Italy, which was allied with Germany and Austria- Hungary before World War I, was neutral in 1914 before switching to the Allied side in May 1915. Historians have vigorously debated Germany's role. One line of interpretation, promoted by German historian Fritz Fischer in the 1960s, argues that Germany had long desired to dominate Europe politically and economically, and seized the opportunity that unexpectedly opened in July 1914, making her guilty of starting the war. At the opposite end of the moral spectrum, many historians have argued that the war was inadvertent, caused by a series of complex accidents that overburdened the long-standing alliance system with its lock-step mobilization system that no‚Äìone could control. A third approach, especially important in recent years, is that Germany saw itself surrounded by increasingly powerful enemies‚ÄìRussia, France and Britain‚Äìwho would eventually crush it unless Germany acted defensively with a preemptive strike.Mark Hewitson. Germany and the Causes of the First World War (2004) pp 1-20. Military alignments in 1914. When the war started Italy declared neutrality; in 1915 it switched and joined the Triple Entente (i.e. the Allies). Background As the war started, Germany stood behind its ally Austria-Hungary in a confrontation with Serbia, but Serbia was under the protection of Russia, which was allied to France. Germany was the leader of the Central Powers, which included Austria-Hungary at the start of the war, and later included the Ottoman Empire and Bulgaria; arrayed against them were the Allies, consisting chiefly of Russia, France and Britain at the beginning of the war, Italy, which joined the Allies in 1915, and the United States, which joined the Allies in 1917. There were several main causes of World War I, which broke out unexpectedly in June‚ÄìAugust 1914, including the conflicts and hostility of the previous four decades. Militarism, alliances, imperialism, and ethnic nationalism played major roles. However the immediate origins of the war lay in the decisions taken by statesmen and generals during the July Crisis of 1914, which was sparked by the assassination of Archduke Franz Ferdinand, heir to the throne of Austria-Hungary, by a Serbian secret organization, the Black Hand.Christopher Clark, The Sleepwalkers: How Europe Went to War in 1914 (2012) Since the 1870s or 1880s all the major powers had been preparing for a large-scale war, although none expected one. Britain focused on building up its Royal Navy, already stronger than the next two navies combined. Germany, France, Austria, Italy and Russia and some smaller countries set up conscription systems whereby young men would serve from one to three years in the army, then spend the next 20 years or so in the reserves with annual summer training. Men of higher social status became officers.F. H. Hinsley, ed. The New Cambridge Modern History, Vol. 11: Material Progress and World-Wide Problems, 1870-98 (1962) pp 204-42, esp 214-17. Each country devised a mobilisation system whereby the reserves could be called up quickly and sent to key points by rail. Every year the plans were updated and increased in complexity. Each country stockpiled arms and supplies for an army that ran into the millions. Germany in 1874 had a regular professional army of 420,000, with an additional 1.3 million reserves. By 1897, the regular German army was 545,000 strong and the reserves 3.4 million. The French in 1897 had 3.4 million reservists, Austria 2.6 million, and Russia 4.0 million. All major countries had a general staff which designed war plans against possible enemies.Paul M. Kennedy, ed., The War Plans of the Great Powers, 1880-1914 (1979) All plans called for a decisive opening and a short war.Hinsley (1962) pp 204-42. Germany's Schlieffen Plan was the most elaborate; the German Army was so confident that it would succeed that they made no alternative plans. It was kept secret from Austria, as well as from the German Navy, the chancellor and the foreign ministry, so there was no coordination‚Äìand in the end the plan failed.Craig, \\"The World War I Alliance of the Central Powers in Retrospect: The Military Cohesion of the Alliance\\" Leadership Historians focus on a handful of German leaders, as is the case for most countries in 1914.T,G, Otte, July Crisis (2014) pp. xvii-xxii for a list. For Germany special attention focuses on the Chancellor Theobald von Bethmann-Hollweg, thanks to the discovery of the very rich, candid diary of his top aide Kurt Riezler.Konrad H. Jarausch, \\"The Illusion of Limited War: Chancellor Bethmann Hollweg's Calculated Risk, July 1914\\" Central European History 2.1 (1969): 48-76. online Wilhelm II, German Emperor, the Kaiser, was given enormous publicity by both sides, and signed off on major decisions, but he was largely shunted aside or persuaded by others.Lamar Cecil, Wilhelm II: Emperor and Exile, 1900‚Äì1941 (1996) online. Helmuth von Moltke, the Chief of the German General Staff, was in charge of all planning and operations for the German army. He kept his plans quiet. He had the Kaiser's approval, but did not share any details with the Navy, the Chancellor, or his allies. Increasingly as a crisis grew, Moltke became the most powerful man in Germany.Craig, Gordon A. The politics of the Prussian army 1640-1945 (1955) pp 292-95. =Public opinion= Public opinion and pressure groups played a major role in influencing German politics. The Army and Navy each had their nationwide network of supporters, with a million members in the German Navy League, founded in 1898,Geoff Eley, \\"Reshaping the right: Radical nationalism and the German Navy League, 1898‚Äì1908.\\" Historical Journal 21.2 (1978): 327-340 online. and 20,000 in the German Army League, founded in 1912.Marilyn Shevin Coetzee, The German Army League: Popular Nationalism in Wilhelmine Germany (1990) The most articulate and aggressive civilian organization was the \\"Pan- German League\\".Roger Chickering, . We men who feel most German: a cultural study of the Pan-German League, 1886-1914 (1984). The agrarian interest was led by large landowners who were especially interested in exports and was politically well organized. Major corporations in the steel and coal industries were effective lobbyists. All of these economic groups promoted an aggressive foreign-policy. Bankers and financiers were not as pacifistic as their counterparts in London, but they did not play a large role in shaping foreign policy. Pacifism had its own well-organized groups, and the labour unions strongly denounced war before it was declared. In the 1912 elections, the Socialists (Social Democratic Party or SPD), based in the labour unions, won 35% of the national vote. Conservative elites exaggerated the implicit threats made by radical Socialists such as August Bebel and became alarmed. Some looked to a foreign war as a solution to Germany's internal problems; others considered ways to suppress the Socialists.Dieter Groh, \\"The 'Unpatriotic Socialists' and the State.\\" Journal of Contemporary History 1.4 (1966): 151-177. online. SPD policy limited antimilitarism to aggressive wars‚ÄîGermans saw 1914 as a defensive war. On 25 July 1914, the SPD leadership appealed to its membership to demonstrate for peace and large numbers turned out in orderly demonstrations. The SPD was not revolutionary and many members were nationalistic. When the war began, some conservatives wanted to use force to suppress the SPD, but Bethmann-Hollweg wisely refused. The SPD members of parliament voted 96-14 on 3 August to support the war. There remained an antiwar element especially in Berlin. They were expelled from the SPD in 1916 and formed the Independent Social Democratic Party of Germany.V. R. Berghahn, Germany and the Approach of War in 1914 (1974) pp 178-85 Newspaper editorials indicated that the nationalist right-wing was openly in favor of war, even a preventive one, while moderate editors would only support a defensive war. Both the conservative press and the liberal press increasingly used the rhetoric of German honour and popular sacrifice, and often depicted the horrors of Russian despotism in terms of Asiatic barbarism.Margaret MacMillan, The war that ended peace p. 605.Jeffrey Verhey, The Spirit of 1914: Militarism, Myth, and Mobilization in Germany (2000) pp 17-20. German goals Historian Fritz Fischer unleashed an intense worldwide debate in the 1960s on Germany's long-term goals. American historian Paul Schroeder agrees with the critics that Fischer exaggerated and misinterpreted many points. However, Schroeder endorses Fischer's basic conclusion: : From 1890 on, Germany did pursue world power. This bid arose from deep roots within Germany's economic, political, and social structures. Once the war broke out, world power became Germany's essential goal.Paul W. Schroeder, \\"World War I as Galloping Gertie: A Reply to Joachim Remak,\\" Journal of Modern History 44#3 (1972), pp. 319-345, at p/ 320 online However, Schroeder argues, all that was not the main cause of the war in 1914‚ÄîIndeed the search for a single main cause is not a helpful approach to history. Instead, there are multiple causes any one or two of which could have launched the war. He argues, \\"The fact that so many plausible explanations for the outbreak of the war have been advanced over the years indicates on the one hand that it was massively overdetermined, and on the other that no effort to analyze the causal factors involved can ever fully succeed.\\"Schroeder p 320 Many historians in recent years have stressed that insecurity about the future deeply troubled German policy makers and motivated them toward preemptive war before it was too late. The nation was surrounded by enemies who were getting stronger; the bid to rival British naval supremacy had failed.Matthew S. Seligmann, \\"‚ÄòA Barometer of National Confidence‚Äô: a British Assessment of the Role of Insecurity in the Formulation of German Military Policy before the First World War.\\" English Historical Review 117.471 (2002): 333-355.online Bethmann-Hollweg was mesmerized by the steady growth of Russian power, which was in large part due to French financial and technical assistance. For the Germans, this deepened the worry often expressed by the Kaiser that Germany was being surrounded by enemies who were growing in strength. One implication was that time was against them, and a war happening sooner would be more advantageous for Germany than a war happening later. For the French, there was a growing fear that Russia would become significantly more powerful than France, and become more independent of France, possibly even returning to its old military alliance with Germany. The implication was that a war sooner could count on the Russian alliance, but the longer it waited the greater the likelihood of a Russian alliance with Germany that would doom France.Otte, July Crisis (2014) pp 99, 135-36. France, a third smaller than Germany, needed Russia's vast potential, and the fear was that together the two would in a few years clearly surpass Germany's military capability. This argued for war sooner rather than later. Bethmann-Hollweg knew he was undertaking a calculated risk by backing a local war in which Austria would politically destroy Serbia. The hope was to \\"localize\\" that war by keeping the other powers out of it. Russia had no treaty obligations to Serbia, but was trying to fashion itself as the leader of the Slavic peoples in opposition to their German and Austrian oppressors. If Russia intervened to defend Serbia, Germany would have to intervene to defend Austria, and very likely France would honor its treaty obligation and join with Russia. Bethmann-Hollweg assumed Britain had no interest in the Balkans and would remain neutral. It was also possible that Russia would go to war but France would not follow, in which case the Triple Entente would become meaningless. The calculated risk failed when Russia mobilized. The German general staff, which was always hawkish and eager for war, now took control of German policy. Its war plan called for immediate action before Russia could mobilize much force, and instead use very rapid mobilization of German active duty and reserve forces to invade France through Belgium. Once France was knocked out, the German troops would be sent to the East to defeat Russia with the assistance of the Austrian army. Once Russia mobilized, on July 31, Austria and Germany mobilized. The Germans had a very sophisticated plan for rapid mobilization. It worked well while everyone else was days or weeks behind. The general staff convinced the Kaiser to activate their war plan, and Bethmann- Hollweg could only follow along. Most historians treat the Kaiser as a man far out of his depth who was under the spell of the Army General staff.Konrad H. Jarausch, \\"The Illusion of Limited War: Chancellor Bethmann Hollweg's Calculated Risk, July 1914\\", Central European History 2.1 (1969): 48-76. online In 1913, the Army Act raised Germany's peace strength to 870,000 men, and raising the eventual war strength from 4.5 million to 5.4 million. France responded by expanding the training period for all draftees from two years to three. Russia likewise raised its army size to a wartime basis of 5.4 million. Austria in 1913 raised its war strength to 2.0 million. All the rival armies improved their efficiency, especially with more powerful artillery and machine guns. The main war plan, the Schlieffen Plan, was drawn up by the Army headquarters. It called for a great infantry sweep through Belgium to encircle Paris and defeat France in a matter of weeks. Then the forces would be moved by rail to the Eastern Front, to defeat the Russians. The plan was not shared with the Navy, the Foreign Office, the Chancellor, the main ally in Vienna, or the separate Army commands in Bavaria and the other states. No one could point out problems or plan to coordinate with it. The generals who did know about it counted on it giving a quick victory within weeks‚Äîif that did not happen there was no \\"Plan B.\\"Holger H. Herwig, \\"Through the Looking Glass: German Strategic Planning before 1914\\" The Historian 77#2 (2015) pp 290-314.Peter Padfield, The Great Naval Race: The Anglo-German Naval Rivalry, 1900-1914 (2005) p 335. Rivalry with Britain  In explaining why neutral Britain went to war with Germany, Paul Kennedy (1980) recognized it was critical for war that Germany become economically more powerful than Britain, but he downplays the disputes over economic trade imperialism, the Baghdad Railway, confrontations in Central and Eastern Europe, highly-charged political rhetoric and domestic pressure groups. Germany's reliance time and again on sheer power, while Britain increasingly appealed to moral sensibilities, played a role, especially in seeing the invasion of Belgium as a profound moral and diplomatic crime. Kennedy argues that by far the main reason was London's fear that a repeat of 1870 ‚Äî when Prussia and the German states smashed France in the Franco-Prussian War ‚Äî would mean that Germany, with a powerful army and navy, would control the English Channel and northwest France. British policymakers insisted that that would be a catastrophe for British security.Paul M. Kennedy, The Rise of the Anglo-German Antagonism, 1860‚Äì1914 (1980) pp 464‚Äì70. =Naval race= The British Royal Navy dominated the globe in the 19th century, but after 1890, Germany attempted to challenge Britain's supremacy. The resulting naval race heightened tensions between the two nations. In 1897, Admiral Alfred von Tirpitz became German Naval Secretary of State and began transformation of the Imperial German Navy from a small, coastal defence force to a fleet that was meant to challenge British naval power. As part of the wider bid to alter the international balance of power decisively in Germany's favour, Tirpitz called for a Risikoflotte (Risk Fleet), so called because, although still smaller than the British fleet, it would be too large for Britain to risk taking it on.William L. Langer, The diplomacy of imperialism: 1890-1902 (1951) pp 433-42.Peter Padfield, The Great Naval Race: Anglo-German Naval Rivalry 1900-1914 (2005) The German Navy, under Tirpitz, had ambitions to rival the Royal Navy and dramatically expanded its fleet in the early 20th century to protect the colonies, German commerce, the homeland, and to exert power worldwide.David Woodward, \\"Admiral Tirpitz, Secretary of State for the Navy, 1897‚Äì1916,\\" History Today (July 1963) 13#8 pp=548‚Äì55. In 1890, to protect its new fleet, Germany traded possessions. It obtained the strategic island of Heligoland off the German North Sea coast and gave up the island of Zanzibar in Africa.David R. Gillard, \\"Salisbury's African Policy and the Heligoland Offer of 1890.\\" English Historical Review 75.297 (1960): 631-653. online In 1898, Tirpitz started a programme of warship construction. The British, however, were always well ahead in the race. The British Dreadnought battleship of 1907 was so advanced in terms of speed and firepower that all other warships were immediately made obsolete. Germany copied it but never surged ahead in quality or numbers.Holger H. Herwig, \\"The German reaction to the Dreadnought revolution.\\" International History Review 13.2 (1991): 273-283. Blank cheque Berlin repeatedly and urgently called on Vienna to act quickly in response to the assassination on June 28, so that a counter alliance would not have time to organize, and Austria could blame its intense anger at the atrocious act. Vienna delayed its critical ultimatum until July 23, and its actual invasion until August 13. That allowed time for the Russian-French opposition to organize. It also allowed an investigation to turn up many details but no evidence pointing directly to the government of Serbia. The main reason for the delay was the fact that practically the entire Austrian army was tied down at home in harvest work, providing a food supply that would be essential for any war once the reserves were called to duty.Richard F. Hamilton, and Holger H. Herwig, Decisions for War, 1914-1917 (2004) pp. 63-67.Samuel R. Williamson, Jr. \\"Confrontation With Serbia: The Consequences of Vienna's Failure to Achieve Surprise in July 1914\\" Mitteilungen des √ñsterreichischen Staatsarchivs 1993, Vol. 44, pp 168-177. In July, 1914, Germany gave Austria a \\"blank cheque\\" in handling its punishment of Serbia regarding the assassination of the heir to the Austrian throne. It meant that Germany would support whatever decision Austria made. Austria decided on war with Serbia, which quickly led to escalation with Russia. Bethmann-Hollweg on July 6 told the Austrian ambassador in Berlin: :Finally, as far as concerns Serbia, His Majesty, of course, cannot interfere in the dispute now going on between Austria-Hungary and that country, as it is a matter not within his competence. The Emperor Francis Joseph may, however, rest assured that His Majesty will faithfully stand by Austria- Hungary,[editor: Bethmann-Hollweg here deleted the phrase \\"under all circumstances\\" which had appeared in his first draft] as is required by the obligations of his alliance and of his ancient friendship. Shortly after the war began, the German foreign office issued a statement justifying the Blank Check as necessary for the preservation of Austria, and the Teutonic (German) race in central Europe. The statement said: : it was clear to Austria that it was not compatible with the dignity and the spirit of self-preservation of the monarchy to view idly any longer this agitation across the border. The Imperial and Royal Government appraised Germany of this conception and asked for our opinion. With all our heart we were able to agree with our ally's estimate of the situation, and assure him that any action considered necessary to end the movement in Servia (sic) directed against the conservation of the monarchy would meet with our approval. We were perfectly aware that a possible warlike attitude of Austria-Hungary against Servia might bring Russia upon the field, and that it might therefore involve us in a war, in accordance with our duty as allies. We could not, however, in these vital interests of Austria- Hungary, which were at stake, advise our ally to take a yielding attitude not compatible with his dignity, nor deny him our assistance in these trying days. We could do this all the less as our own interests were menaced through the continued Serb agitation. If the Serbs continued with the aid of Russia and France to menace the existence of Austria-Hungary, the gradual collapse of Austria and the subjection of all the Slavs under one Russian sceptre would be the consequence, thus making untenable the position of the Teutonic race in Central Europe.See \\"The German White Book\\" (1914) July: crisis and war In early July 1914, in the aftermath of the assassination of Franz Ferdinand and the immediate likelihood of war between Austria-Hungary and Serbia, the German government informed the Austro-Hungarian government that Germany would uphold its alliance with Austria-Hungary and defend it from possible Russian intervention if a war between Austria-Hungary and Serbia took place. Austria depended entirely on Germany for support ‚Äì it had no other ally it could trust‚Äì but the Kaiser lost control of the German government. Bethmann-Hollweg had repeatedly rejected pleas from Britain and Russia to put pressure on Austria to compromise. German elite and popular public opinion also was demanding mediation. Now in late July he reversed himself, and pleaded, or demanded, that Austria accept mediation, warning that Britain would probably join Russia and France if a larger war started. The Kaiser made a direct appeal to Emperor Franz Joseph along the same lines. However, Bethmann-Hollweg and the Kaiser did not know that the German military had its own line of communication to the Austrian military, and insisted on rapid mobilization against Russia. German Chief of Staff Moltke sent an emotional telegram to the Austrian Chief of Staff Conrad on July 30: \\"Austria-Hungary must be preserved, mobilise at once against Russia. Germany will mobilise.\\" Vienna officials decided that Moltke was really in charge‚Äîwhich was true‚Äîand refused mediation and mobilized against Russia.Margaret MacMillan, The War That Ended Peace: The Road to 1914 (2013) pp 605-607. When Russia enacted a general mobilization, Germany viewed the act as provocative. The Russian government promised Germany that its general mobilization did not mean preparation for war with Germany but was a reaction to the events between Austria-Hungary and Serbia. The German government regarded the Russian promise of no war with Germany to be nonsense in light of its general mobilization, and Germany, in turn, mobilized for war. On 1 August, Germany sent an ultimatum to Russia stating that since both Germany and Russia were in a state of military mobilization, an effective state of war existed between the two countries. Later that day, France, an ally of Russia, declared a state of general mobilization. The German government justified military action against Russia as necessary because of Russian aggression as demonstrated by the mobilization of the Russian army that had resulted in Germany mobilizing in response.Richard F. Hamilton and Holger H. Herwig, Decisions for War, 1914-1917 (2004), pp 70-91. After Germany declared war on Russia, France with its alliance with Russia prepared a general mobilization in expectation of war. On 3 August 1914, Germany responded to this action by declaring war on France. Germany, facing a two- front war, enacted what was known as the Schlieffen Plan, which involved German armed forces needing to move through Belgium and swing south into France and towards the French capital of Paris. This plan aimed to gain a quick victory against the French and allow German forces to concentrate on the Eastern Front. Belgium was a neutral country and would not accept German forces crossing its territory. Germany disregarded Belgian neutrality and invaded the country to launch an offensive towards Paris. This caused Great Britain to declare war against the German Empire, as the action violated the Treaty of London that both Britain and Prussia had signed in 1839 guaranteeing Belgian neutrality and defense of the kingdom if a nation reneged. Subsequently, several states declared war on Germany in late August 1914, with Italy declaring war on Austria-Hungary in 1915 and Germany on 27 August 1916; the United States on 6 April 1917 and Greece in July 1917. Ottoman ally 1912 Danish cartoon shows Balkan states tearing apart the rickety Ottoman Empire in First Balkan War, October 1912 Turkey had been badly defeated in a series of wars in the previous decade, losing the two Balkan Wars of 1912-13 and the Italo-Turkish War in 1911-12.R. Ernest Dupuy and Trevor N. Dupuy, The Encyclopedia of Military History from 3500 B.C. to the Present (1977) pp 926-28. However, relations with Germany had been excellent, involving investment aid in financing, and assistance for the Turkish army.Frank G. Weber, Eagles on the crescent: Germany, Austria, and the diplomacy of the Turkish alliance, 1914-1918 (1970). In late 1913 German general Liman von Sanders was hired to reorganize the army, and to command the Ottoman forces at Constantinople. Russia and France vigorously objected, and forced a reduction in his role. Russia had the long-term goal of sponsoring the new Slavic states in the Balkan region, and had designs on control of the Straits (allowing entry into the Mediterranean), and even taking over Constantinople. There was a long-standing conflict between Britain and Germany over the Baghdad Railway through the Ottoman Empire. It would have projected German power toward Britain's sphere of influence (India and southern Persia), was resolved in June 1914. Berlin agreed not to construct the line south of Baghdad, and to recognize Britain's preponderant interest in the region. The issue was resolved to the satisfaction of both sides and did not play a role in causing the war. In June, 1914, Vienna and Berlin discussed bringing Bulgaria and Turkey into their military alliance, to neutralize the threat of the Balkan League under Russian and French auspices. When the war broke out, the Ottoman Empire was officially neutral at first, but leaning toward the Central Powers. Promises of war loans, military coordination, and recovery of lost territories appealed to Turkish nationalists, especially the Young Turks under Enver Pasha and the nationalist Committee of Union and Progress (CUP).F.

With a handful of exceptions, all their cards are still made by hand. The company logo is a tengu mask with a long nose.Pate, Alan. Kanban: Traditional Shop Signs of Japan, p. 17. Princeton University Press. History The company itself states they were founded under the name Minatoya in 1800 by an Oishi Kuranosuke, during the Edo period, when both selling and using hanafuda and many other karuta for gambling was illegal. To get around this, their cover business was that of a rice merchant, and the production and selling of hanafuda and other karuta happened strictly under the counter. If the official founding date of 1800 could be independently verified, this would make Oishi Tengudo the oldest card manufacturer continuously producing cards in the world, though since the production was illicit at the time, there is only scant evidence for this founding date. The name \\"Tengudo\\" was most likely adopted after hanafuda was legalized in the middle of the Meiji period. At this time, they were sold in Tokyo through a reseller called Nishimura Shoten, who took out several newspaper advertisements for their cards. The \\"gwang\\" (or \\"hikari\\") marks seen on modern Korean hanafuda (\\"hwatu\\") stem from an innovation by Oishi Tengudo according to the 7th head Masafumi Maeda. Oishi Tengudo would stamp the 20-point cards in some of their decks with a gold stamp, and some of these decks were subsequently exported to Korea, before World War II, when Korea was annexed by Japan. While in the 1930s, the company had 30 employees, in 2000, that number had been reduced to only 6. The demand for hanafuda decreased precipitously in the mid-1970s, and the market was largely dominated by Nintendo, who had began mass-producing hanafuda soon after the war (around 1955, a couple of years after the construction of their first factory, they held 95% of the market). Oishi Tengudo were one of few traditional playing card manufacturers able to survive thanks to a \\"silent boom\\" in their hyakunin isshu karuta sales. Though the company is small, it held half the market in terms of hyakunin isshu sales in 2000., largely thanks to being the official manufacturer for competitive karuta.  Notable products  Oishi Tengudo was commissioned by Japan's first prime minister It≈ç Hirobumi to produce a 'Prime Minister's edition' of Hanafuda. Reproductions are still sold in Paulownia-wood boxes. They are the only commercial manufacturer recently producing Tensho karuta, the earliest pattern of playing card produced in Japan.\\"Kyoto shop reprints 400-year-old 'karuta'\\", The Japan Times. Oishi Tengudo have released a hanafuda together with Studio Ghibli, containing illustrations of characters from the movie Spirited Away. They have also released a limited edition hanafuda in subdued \\"coffee-inspired\\" colors for the launch of Starbucks Reserve Roastery's first store in Tokyo.

Prusik Peak is part of The Enchantments within the Alpine Lakes Wilderness, and is often the iconic photographic image of both areas. Prusik Peak belongs to the Stuart Range which is a subset of the Cascade Range. The name honors Dr. Karl Prusik (1896‚Äì1961) who was an Austrian mountaineer, and is known as the inventor of the prusik, a rope knot which happened to be used to gain access to the summit horn during the first ascent by Fred Beckey in 1948. Precipitation runoff drains into Icicle Creek, a tributary of the Wenatchee River. Climate Most weather fronts originate in the Pacific Ocean, and travel east toward the Cascade Mountains. As fronts approach, they are forced upward by the peaks of the Cascade Range, causing them to drop their moisture in the form of rain or snowfall onto the Cascades (Orographic lift). As a result, the Cascades experience high precipitation, especially during the winter months in the form of snowfall. During winter months, weather is usually cloudy, but, due to high pressure systems over the Pacific Ocean that intensify during summer months, there is often little or no cloud cover during the summer. Because of maritime influence, snow tends to be wet and heavy, resulting in high avalanche danger. Geology The Alpine Lakes Wilderness features some of the most rugged topography in the Cascade Range with craggy peaks and ridges, deep glacial valleys, and granite walls spotted with over 700 mountain lakes. Geological events occurring many years ago created the diverse topography and drastic elevation changes over the Cascade Range leading to the various climate differences. The history of the formation of the Cascade Mountains dates back millions of years ago to the late Eocene Epoch. With the North American Plate overriding the Pacific Plate, episodes of volcanic igneous activity persisted. In addition, small fragments of the oceanic and continental lithosphere called terranes created the North Cascades about 50 million years ago. During the Pleistocene period dating back over two million years ago, glaciation advancing and retreating repeatedly scoured the landscape leaving deposits of rock debris. The last glacial retreat in the Alpine Lakes area began about 14,000 years ago and was north of the Canada‚ÄìUS border by 10,000 years ago. The ‚ÄúU‚Äù-shaped cross section of the river valleys are a result of that recent glaciation. Uplift and faulting in combination with glaciation have been the dominant processes which have created the tall peaks and deep valleys of the Alpine Lakes Wilderness area.

Small numbers may also be present in Kuwait, Iraq, Jordan, and Syria. The total population of wild sand gazelles is thought to be less than 3,000.

A 2010 genetic study established that it was a distinct lineage, and it is now considered a separate species. Further genetic analysis reported in 2012 found that the sand gazelle was closely related to two North African gazelles, Cuvier's gazelle (Gazella cuvieri) and the rhim (Gazella leptoceros), perhaps even belonging to a single species.

He was an Honorary Fellow of the International Institute of Social History.  Biography  Keshavarz Sadr was the son of Mohammad Ali Keshavarz Sadr, Prime Minister Mossadegh's deputy and a leader of the National Front (1960-1963). He obtained his BA in 1963 in Social Sciences and in 1967 in Anthropology from the University of Tehran. He became active in politics at a young age as a member of the Tudeh Party, but after the August 28 Coup, along with Bijan Jazani and some other leftist students from the University of Tehran, he joined the national movement and enlisted at the Second National Front. It was at this point that he formed a close friendship with Abolhassan Banisadr, whom he would stay in touch with for the rest of his life. Through his continued political engagement he became a member of the National Front's Executive Council. Shapur Bakhtiar, the last prime minister before the overthrow of the Shah's regime, invited Keshavarz Sadr to be a minister in his cabinet, but failed to secure his consent. In 1978, Keshavarz Sadr was appointed Director of the Centre for Indigenous Development Studies, the research arm and effective think-tank of the Alashtar Indigenous Regional Development Project. In 1979, he was appointed Deputy Minister of Agriculture in Bazargan's Provisional Government and later became the President's Rural and Agricultural Advisor. In 1981 he was forced into exile. Since 1986, he has been the President and Director of CIDR, the Centre for Iranian Documentation and Research. He was a frequent visitor to Chicago and lived in the city for a year and a half beginning in fall 1990. He made significant contributions to the intellectual and cultural life of Iranians living there. His residence was a small room in the Dehkhoda Library (3224 West Bryn Mawr Avenue), which he had named, and which was an attempt by Iranians to provide a cultural centre for their community in Chicago. He authored the book 'Mossadegh and the Future of Iran', a document of historical significance considering his friendship with Mossadegh. Ali Rahnema dedicated his book 'Behind the 1953 Coup in Iran: Thugs, Turncoats, Soldiers, and Spooks' to his memory. He donated an important collection of documents of and about the CIDR to the International Institute of Social History.

Established by the Swiss Confederation and the University of Geneva it focuses on hydro-diplomacy to prevent and resolve water-related conflicts, conducts water related research, runs education courses and is a think-tank on global water governance and its challenges.  History and Key Work Founded in 2014, the Geneva Water Hub, with offices at the University of Geneva and the World Meteorological Organization, works to bridge the gap between water research, policy and practice on the ground - often at cross boundary and river basin scale. From 2015 until 2017 it acted as the Secretariat to the Global High Level Panel on Water and Peace and now acts as the secretariat for the Group of Friends for Water and Peace, about forty countries represented by their Permanent Missions to the United Nations in Geneva. It also coordinates the Universities Partnership for Water Cooperation and Diplomacy, launched at the 2018 World Economic Forum in Davos, Switzerland with IHE Delft Institute for Water Education, the Indian Institute of Technology Guwahati, the German-Kazakh University in Almaty, and Oregon State University. This university consortium was established to encourage dialogue and capacity-building between countries and among different professional sectors. = Water and Peace = In 2015, the World Economic Forum ranked water scarcity as the largest global risk over the next decade. Already, 40% of the world's population is affected by water scarcity on a planet where more than 260 international rivers cross many man-made boundaries. In addition, more than half the planet's wetlands have disappeared and climate change is impacting weather and water patterns around the world. Yet, as the dialogue of ‚Äòwater wars‚Äô increases, research shows that water is far more a tool for cooperation and peace than conflict. During the 20th century there were only seven minor confrontations over water, with 145 treaties signed in the same 100 years. Through academic research, policy and hydro-diplomacy the Geneva Water Hub works to shift the global dialogue from ‚Äòwater and conflict‚Äô to ‚Äòwater for peace and cooperation‚Äô, to deliver better water governance and the long-term protection of critical water resources and infrastructure. = Global High-Level Panel on Water and Peace = In 2015, the Geneva Water Hub began working as Secretariat to the Global High Level Panel on Water and Peace ‚Äì a 15 country co-convened initiative focused on strengthening the global framework to prevent and resolve water-related conflicts and to facilitate the use of water as an instrument of peace and cooperation. In its 2017 report ‚ÄúA Matter of Survival‚Äù the Global High-Level Panel on Water and Peace outlined its recommendations for a fundamental rethinking of international water cooperation from the UN Security Council to other multilateral institutions and down to grass-roots level organisations. = Water Governance Education = At the University of Geneva, the Geneva Water Hub runs an annual Summer School in Water Governance and a distance learning course on International Water Law and the Law of Transboundary Aquifers.

Development The gun was initially conceived as a replacement for the FB P-64, FB P-83 Wanad and WIST-94 in the Polish military. At first there were plans to modernize the MAG-98 with the help of Works 11, but this idea was soon dropped. Work on the development began in 2009. The design was to be in accordance with the requirements of the Polish military, which were outlined in a tactical-technical document published in 2014. The projects head designer was Piotr Dygas, who was supported by an engineering team which included Pawe≈Ç Madej and Marian Gryszkiewicz. Both of whom were related to the development of the MAG-95/98 pistol. Despite external similarities to the MAG-98, the PR-15 was actually designed from scratch because FB Radom did not have the technical documentation of the pistol, which was owned by a different company that was bought by Works 11. However, the initial prototypes did feature some components from the MAG-98. There were twelve pre-production prototypes manufactured for various trials, including military certification tests. These were also presented to journalist in 2014, which later created some confusion over the origin of this guns design. In reality, the designs are largely incompatible, including their magazines. Preliminary and qualification tests began in 2016. Development of the pistol ended in 2017 and it passed military qualification tests at the end of the year. In December 2018, a contract was signed for the delivery of PR-15, or Vis 100, to the Polish army. In 2019, the contract was extended to a total of 19,900 pistols.https://www.armyrecognition.com/december_2018_global_defense_security_army_news_industry/radom_to_provide_20000_pr-15_ragun_or_vis_100_pistols_to_polish_army.html The name PR-15 is derived from the acronymization of pistolet, meaning pistol in Polish, and Radom, which is the name of the company. The number 15 signifies the initial projected year of release of the pistol. Ragun is a portmanteau of Radom and gun. Design details The PR-15 Ragun is a semi- automatic pistol chambered for the 9√ó19mm Parabellum round, utilizing the short recoil method of operation. The gun has a double-action/single-action trigger with a pull force of 25 N in single-action and 50 N in double-action and 14 mm of travel. It features an aluminium-alloy frame with a MIL-STD-1913 compatible rail, which enables the attachment of tactical lights or laser sighting equipment. The frame has steel inserts to accommodate the steel slide. The metal parts are covered with Tenifer metal coating for abrasion and corrosion resistance. The frame grip covers are plastic. It was developed to be fully ambidextrous, with the magazine release, slide stop and decocker lever positioned on both sides of the gun. Some of the components are manufactured with metal injection molding. It uses a double-stack, 15-round box magazine, weighing about 90 grams. Civilian versions of the gun might have an option for fitting a rail adapter on the slide of the gun to attach red dot sights.

Documented from 1483, the was resident on the estate, given as a fief of Bishop , the head of the Diocese of Paderborn. Some of the present buildings date back to the 16th century. When the moated castle was destroyed by a fire, the Borch family erected a manor house in Neoclassical style, built from 1801 to 1809 by Wilhelm Carl Hisner, an architect from Kassel, within the former moat. Close to the manor house are four stables. The estate is well preserved and a listed monument. It is still used as a farm, following the standards of the Demeter organisation for biodynamic agriculture. It is also a venue of community events, such as a Christmas market, school theatre festivals and a regular culture festival called Voices.

Produced by Dinesh Vijan under Maddock Films, it stars Kartik Aaryan and Kriti Sanon and the film tells the story of a television reporter who cohabits with his headstrong intern. Chaos ensues when their traditional families assume them to be married to each other. Principal photography for Luka Chuppi began in August 2018 and was completed the following month. It was released on 1 March 2019 and has grossed over worldwide. Plot The film starts with reporters asking film star Nazeem Khan if he is in a live-in relationship. When he replies he is, it causes a media uproar about how he is disrespecting India's culture and being a bad influence for the youth. The film shifts to the small town of Mathura, where Vishnu Trivedi, a failing politician wants a ban on live-in relationships because they are disgraceful and against India's conservative culture. His daughter Rashmi takes up an internship at a local news channel, and starts working with the channel's star reporter Vinod \\"Guddu\\" Kumar Shukla and his best friend, cameraman Abbas Sheikh. Guddu and Rashmi fall in love and Guddu proposes. Flustered, she says she is not ready for marriage and wants to get to know Guddu first. She suggests a live-in relationship to test their compatibility but Guddu doesn't want one, being slightly more traditional. Abbas suggests trying a live-in relationship during their 20-day business trip to Gwalior. The couple agree. The three find an apartment to rent. Their neighbor Mrs. Srivastava however is suspicious and asks how long they have been married. On the spot, they mix up answers and Mrs. Srivastava, certain that they are living together without being married, calls for the neighborhood to oust them from the apartment. Guddu and Rashmi come up with fake photos of their wedding overnight to put around the house as proof. The next morning, the neighbors are shocked to see the wedding pictures and blame Mrs. Srivastava for accusing them. At the end of the 20 days, Guddu reaffirms his love for Rashmi and she says she is ready to marry him. Guddu's nosy relative Babulal sees the two together in public, follows them, sees the fake wedding pictures, and assumes that they eloped. The next morning, Babulal brings Guddu's entire family to their house. His family is shocked and Guddu and Rashmi are unable to admit the truth. They go back to Mathura to tell Rashmi's father Vishnu. Vishnu decides that they should be thankful the two got married and weren't in a live-in relationship and after a quick wedding ceremony, sends Rashmi off. Rashmi goes to live with Guddu and his family because everyone thinks they are now married. Rashmi feels bad about such a big lie and she and Guddu decide to secretly get officially married. The two try multiple times but something or someone always gets in the way. In their last attempt, they try to get married in an anonymous public mass marriage event. Unfortunately, Vishnu is the chief guest. Guddu and Rashmi are caught as his family also shows up at the venue. Exasperated, they admit they are not married and had been in a live-in relationship. Guddu explains to Vishnu that the reason Vishnu keeps losing the elections is because the majority of the voting group is the new generation, who believe in modernity, and opposing their methods equals lack of support from them, making Vishnu lose the majority percentage of votes. He convinces Vishnu to stop opposing live-in relationships. Everyone finally gets Guddu and Rashmi married.

This clean comedy would get thumbs up not just from the youngsters but also from the family audiences. Kartik Aaryan once again is in a great form. His boyish looks work instantly but it's his performance that makes it even more endearing. Kriti Sanon has a fantastic screen presence and maintains a strong position. She also surprisingly shines in an important emotional sequence in the second half.\\" Komal Nahta said, \\"Kartik Aryan does a fine job as Guddu. His acting is effortless and he is the best when he is helpless in the second half. Kriti Sanon looks very pretty and plays Rashmi ably. She has an endearing style which enables her to connect well with the viewers. Pankaj Tripathi deserves full marks for playing Babulal so effectively. It would not be wrong to say that he brings the house down with laughter each time he comes on the screen. Aparshakti Khurrana stands out in a relatively subdued role as Abbas. He is very entertaining in the second half.\\" Filmfare said, \\"Kriti Sanon is spontaneous throughout and seems to be finding her feet in comedy, having a gala time of it all in the process. Kartik Aaryan displays wholesome charm and plays his part perfectly. Aparshakti instils the fun with minute shrugs and gestures and keeps it subtle but effective nonetheless.\\" Faridoon Shahryar of Bollywood Hungama said, \\"Laxman Utekar's Luka Chuppi is a feel good entertainer that charms with its simplicity, cool music score and fine performances by Kartik, Kriti, Vinay Pathak, Pankaj Tripathi and Aparshakti Khurrana.

The Watsons were also keen gardeners. A car accident brought this outdoors lifestyle to an abrupt halt however, leaving Watson paralysed and in great pain. He was nursed by his wife and died in 2001, at the age of 77, from pneumonia in the coronary care unit he had helped establish. Bibliography * Paediatric cardiology, Hamish Watson.

Early life  George Neil Stewart was born in Canada at London, Ontario, the son of James Innes and Catherine Sutherland Stewart. His parents returned to Scotland and he grew up in Lybster in Caithness. He studied at the University of Edinburgh starting in 1879, graduating M.A. in 1883 with honours in Mathematics before progressing to study Medicine. He was Mackay Smith scholar in 1883-1884. Eminent professors from whom he learned included Peter Guthrie Tait, with whom he took up an assistantship in 1879, and William Rutherford, from whom he learned physiology. To pursue these interests further, in 1886‚Äì1887 he went to Berlin to study with Emil du Bois-Reymond. He received further qualifications at Edinburgh, receiving his B.Sc in 1886, D.Sc in 1887, M.B., C.M. in 1889, and finally his M.D. in 1891, winning the gold medal for his graduation thesis, The influence of temperature and of endocardiac pressure on the heart, and particularly on the action of the vagus and cardiac sympathetic nerves. Additionally, in 1892 he submitted an essay for the Goodsir Memorial Prize, Researches on the circulation time in organs and on the influences which affect it.  Early career  Following his D.Sc, Stewart became senior demonstrator of physiology at Owens College, Victoria University, Manchester (1887‚Äì1889), where he learned from William Stirling the value of the illustrative experiment in teaching science. He then became a George Henry Lewes student at Downing College, Cambridge (1889-1893), receiving his D.P.H. in 1890. He acted as examiner in physiology at Aberdeen (1890‚Äì1894) and spent time in Strasbourg in 1892.  American career  In 1893, Stewart went to Harvard University as instructor in physiology following an invitation from Henry P. Bowditch. In 1894 he was appointed professor of physiology and histology at Western Reserve University School of Medicine, in Cleveland, Ohio, where he remained with the exception of the years 1903‚Äì1907 during which he was professor of physiology at the University of Chicago. In 1907 he became professor of experimental medicine and director of the H.K. Cushing Laboratory of Experimental Medicine; he was also clinical physiologist to Lakeside Hospital, Cleveland.  Research and publications  At Cleveland, using improvised laboratory equipment, Stewart began illustrating lectures with experiments. This inspired his 796-page Manual of Physiology (1895), the first work of its kind to include practical exercises for students. The practice spread and the Manual became a standard text, going into 8 editions by 1918. After earlier work on color vision, electrophysiology, Talbot's law, cardiac nerves, otoliths, muscle proteins, and permeability of blood corpuscles, Stewart later experimentally investigated such clinical problems as the effect of total anemia on the brain, resuscitation, the measurement of blood flow by the calorimetric method, and the estimation of pulmonary blood capacity and cardiac output by indicator-dilution techniques. With Julius M. Rogoff he studied the functions of the adrenal medulla and cortex, including the epinephrine output and the usefulness of cortex extracts to treat Addison's disease. They discovered that the adrenal cortex was indispensable to the life of higher animals. Stewart published a series of papers on \\"The liberation of epinephrin from the adrenals\\" in the Journal of Pharmacology and Experimental Therapeutics. Stewart was a member of the Physiology Society, American Physiology Society, American Pharmacology Society. The University of Edinburgh awarded him the honorary L.L.D. in 1920.  Later life  Stewart was described as a brilliant teacher, witty, and possessed of prodigious energy and an amazing memory. In later life he suffered from pernicious anemia and progressive spinal degeneration, but he remained mentally alert until the end and made notes about his own condition. Stewart married Louise Kate Powell on 20 September 1906, and his wife and four children were living in Toronto at the time of his death. His funeral was held at the University Chapel at Cleveland on 31 May 1930; his body was cremated and his ashes taken to Toronto. His life was summarised in obituaries of the time in Nature, Science and (with some inaccuracies) in the British Medical Journal.

It was lengthened in both ends in the Late Gothic era. A tower was built on the north side of the church in the Gothic period and later heightened in the Late Gothic style. A chapel was also built on the north side of the church in the late Gothic period while a south chapel was added in circa 1765. The church was probably owned by the crown in early times. The area was crown land and the parish was in 1463 referred to as \\"Koningx Lyngby\\" (Royal Lyngby). In 1682-1758, Lyngby Church was annexed to Gentofte.

The company was launched in 1834 by Dwarakanath Tagore in partnership with William Carr, an indigo trader of Kolkata (then known as Calcutta). Dwarakanath played a leading role in the company, providing its capital, selecting its partners and directing its investment strategy throughout his life. Backdrop The period starting from the late 18th century to the mid-19th century was one of great change. The Industrial Revolution was having a great impact on power equations across the world. The British were reworking their strategy in India. The Charter Act of 1813 ended the monopoly of the East India Company in India‚Äôs overseas trade, except for some items. It opened a flood gate of opportunities for many people. In such an environment Carr, Tagore and Company was a kind of modern day holding company, which promoted many of Dwarakanath‚Äôs pioneering efforts. Soon after its formation, the company became a market leader in indigo trade. Trading in opium, then the currency of world trade, was in the hands of the Europeans and only non-Europeans allowed to handle the contraband material were Parsis. Dwarakanath managed to get an entry into the trade as something like a middle level sub-agent. In capital starved India, the inflow of cash from it gave Dwarkanath an opportunity to toy with a new idea. Carr, Tagore and Company entered the fledgling coal business. Coal In 1770, Suetonius Grant Heatly and John Sumner teamed up to get permission of the East India Company to mine coal. The permission was not granted and they tried again in 1774 and succeeded in getting permission. Miners were brought in from England but they fell sick and died. The problem could be solved by engaging local miners but transportation proved a bottleneck. The Damodar had enough water only few months of the year for transporting coal and so the coal mined had to be stacked for a long time. That degraded its quality. A test carried out in 1778, showed that Indian coal was only half as effective as imported British coal. That sealed the efforts of Heatly and Sumner. The coal front was quiet for some time, but as the demand for coal picked up in Kolkata, in 1814 the economics of mining Indian coal made sense again. The East India Company sponsored William Jones for mining coal in Bardhaman (then Burdwan). He took land on lease from the Rani of Bardhaman and named it Raniganj in her honour. Jones mined coal but incurred persistent losses. In 1821, Alexander & Company, which had secured the loans taken by Jones, took over and started mining. They performed better, raised production and even earned profits for some time, but the company failed in 1832. It was subsequently taken over by Carr, Tagore and Company. In his biography, Partner in Empire: Dwarakanath Tagore and the Age of Enterprise in Eastern India, Blair B. King says, ‚ÄúThe purchase of Raniganj was the most important single transaction of Dwarakanth‚Äôs business transactions.‚Äù King opines that the firm had managerial and technical expertise, plenty of capital and vital ability to handle both the Kolkata officials and the local powers. In C.D.Taylor they had a very effective mine manager at site. There were two troublesome rivals: Jeremiah Homfray, who had a mine at Naraincoory, and the Erskine brothers, with a mine at Munglepore. Carr, Tagore and Company fought with them on many fronts and tried to establish themselves as the sole supplier of coal in the region. In 1843, Homfray‚Äôs mine was taken over by Carr, Tagore and Company to form Bengal Coal Company, whose first action was to close Homfray‚Äôs mine. The British authorities were not happy with the near-monopoly of Carr, Tagore and Company in the field of coal mining. They tried to break it but failed. Bengal‚Äôs industrial development started taking off, powered by Bengal Coal Company‚Äôs coal. After the formation of Bengal Coal Company, the coal industry started getting regularised, but Dwarakanath Tagore, the prime mover, started losing interest in it. Railways Dwarakanath was fascinated by steam engines, which had fuelled the Industrial Revolution in Europe. He dreamt of revolutionising Indian industry with the steam engine. He imported steam engines from England for use in his business ventures. Having seen the earliest railways in Europe he was convinced about their utility in India. With the objective of building a railway from Kolkata to Raniganj, that would carry all his coal to Kolkata, he registered the Great Western of Bengal Railway Company in 1845 and appointed Carr, Tagore and Company its agent. Dwarakanath tried his best to have a deal with the then newly formed East Indian Railway Company but never succeeded. East India Company flatly refused to allow him to build a railway because it felt that it was inappropriate to have railways ‚Äòunder the control of natives‚Äô. The first steam engine of the East Indian Railway Company chugged into Raniganj in 1855. Dwarakanath was dead and gone, but the railways did carry to Kolkata coal mined by the company he had founded. That really was a great chapter in the annals of Indian business marking the beginning of systematic coal mining in India.

However, only one could be definitely proven - the murder of lawyer Bernd Serv√© in January 1953.Der Spiegel, article Murderer on the way from July 5, 1971  Life  Werner Boost was born in 1928 under the name Werner Korecki and spent his childhood and youth in a Protestant orphanage in D√ºsseldorf-Kaiserswerth, where he was adopted. Later he was admitted to a care home after he stole 300 Reichmarks from his mother. Boost never met his father. At the age of 16, after two broken-off lessons, he was drafted into the Wehrmacht and shortly thereafter became an American prisoner of war. After the end of the war and a failed attempt to complete his baker's journeyman apprenticeship, Boost became a casual worker and escape aid in the former GDR. He was therefore sentenced by the judiciary in the Soviet occupation zone to a three-week prison term. In 1949, Boost married and moved the following year with his family, consisting of his wife and two daughters, to his mother's home in D√ºsseldorf. During this time he was sentenced to several months imprisonment for theft, which he had committed together with his friend and later accomplice Franz Lorbach.  Murders  In 1953, a three-year series of couple slayings began. The first victim was the lawyer Bernd Serv√©. Serv√© was in his car with his 18-year-old boyfriend Adolf H√ºllencremer when they were attacked by two masked perpetrators. While Dr Serv√© died immediately after a targeted headshot, Herr H√ºllencremer could escape the same fate thanks to feigning death, at the whispered suggestion of Boost's accomplice. The killers believed he was dead after a blow to the head, but in fact, his skin was only slightly injured and could later alert the police. In November 1955, the police uncovered a sunken car from a gravel pit near D√ºsseldorf-Kalkum, where the bodies of 26-year-old Friedhelm Behre and his girlfriend Thea K√ºrmann were discovered - both robbed and killed, akin to the attack on Serv√© and H√ºllencremer. On February 8, 1956, police officers came across an empty vehicle while searching for two missing persons. Because numerous traces of blood were found inside, the surrounding area was searched extensively. The next day, in a haystack not far from the vehicle, the bodies of the missing 20-year-old secretary Hildegard Wassing and her date Peter Falkenberg were found.  Arrest and trial  Four months later, Boost was arrested. A Revieroberj√§ger discovered him while he was watching a couple in amusement in their car in a grove near D√ºsseldorf. Although there was a chance to escape, Boost did not resist his arrest. At the trial in June 1956, his former accomplice Lorbach testified against Boost. He confessed to the raid on Bernd Serv√© and his partner in 1953, stating that Boost had killed his victim by a targeted headshot. Because of this statement was tried for murder and convicted to life imprisonment. The other murder charges - and another attempted murder of a couple in 1956, which was only prevented because the woman called on passer-bys for help - were seen by the court as insufficient evidence to be proven. The behaviour and actions of the rather unobtrusive defendant during the process were described as charismatic. Similarly, Lorbach, who was portrayed as Boost's personal instrument of bizarre fantasies in search of the perfect murder, described his relationship with Werner Boost. Lorbach was convicted as an accessory of aiding and abetting to six years imprisonment, taking his confession into account. In July 1990, Werner Boost was released after 34 years of imprisonment from the Schwerte Prison.Maxwill, Peter: The excursion murder.

After he had seriously injured two other inmates in jail, he remained in detention until the end of his life.http://vice.typepad.com/vice_germany/2008/10/der- serienkille.html  Early life  Reiner Sturm's parents divorced when he was 15. After attending primary school, he broke off tow lessons as a decorator and toolmaker. He then attended a sailing school in Bremen and went to sea for several years. Instead of became a captain, he became a pimp on the Reeperbahn in St. Pauli. In 1974, he was involved in a bank robbery in Eschersheim, was arrested and sentenced to three years imprisonment, which he served in Preungesheim Prison. There he met felon Heinz Otto Bartel, whom he began to admire. After his release, he broke up with his fianc√©e and best friend, found no work and accumulated debts in six figures. According to his own statements, he contemplated suicide at the time.  Murders  On July 19, 1977, he murdered his 26-year-old ex-girlfriend Gabriele E. in her Wuppertal apartment by knocking her down with a wine bottle, choking, throttling and stabbing her with a kitchen knife several times. Only two hours later, he also murdered his 23-year-old friend Marlies R., also in Wuppertal. Sturm hit the woman down with a hammer, strangled her with her bare hands, abused her with a whip and then killed her with a razor. At the scene of his first murder, he left a message in which he demanded that his friend Heinz Otto Bartel, sentenced to life imprisonment for murder, be released. Sturm then fled to Frankfurt, where he found shelter in the apartment of 28-year-old banker Wolfgang G. Unterschlupf, whom he had met in a pub near the main station. In the following days, he returned to Wuppertal to kill, according to his own words, a hated acquaintance, but could not locate him and returned to Frankfurt. After a search request on television appeared for Sturm, he decided to kill Unterschlupf and in the early morning of July 25 he stabbed him a knife.  Arrest, trial and imprisonment  After spending another day in the apartment, he called a private detective, pretending to be his victim, and was taken to the nearest police station, claiming to have \\"an important clue.\\" During the trip, the detective recognized Reiner Sturm, who immediately admitted that he was the culprit. He said that he couldn't resist killing a third person. He was immediately arrested at the police station in Nordend. Sturm showed no regrets, mocking his victims, refusing to apologize to the bereaved and threatening to kill the prosecutor. He was sentenced on November 23, 1978 by the Wuppertal assizes for threefold murder to life imprisonment. Despite a noted severe mental abnormality, he was found to be fully culpable. In custody, he brutally injured two fellow prisoners perilously and was therefore transferred to the high-security wings in the Cologne Prison, where he spent most of his time in solitary confinement. There Sturm also had a visit from the criminalist Stephan Harbort, who spoke to him for seven hours. After that, Harbort said: \\"The then 47-year-old laughed not once during the first three hours of our conversation, he jumped up from his chair repeatedly, demonstrating how he had cruelly killed the two women. Told that he would like to have killed his father as well. Then this man finally tried to smile. It was a horrible grimace that suddenly flashed on me, barely describable in words. I did not see such a face before and after. I spontaneously thought that could be exactly what is commonly called \\"evil\\". A formative experience that still bothers me today.\\" Reiner Sturm was transferred to the Aachen Prison on April 29, 1998, where he was imprisoned until his death.

In there he kidnapped 61-year-old Hildegard K., the wife of his teacher, on 12 March 1986. As well as kidnapping her, he took money and jewelry worth a total of about 40,000 Deutsche Mark. He tortured the woman before he killed and dismembered her after a week had passed.mopo.de: The sadist with the acid barrel On 5 October 1988, Reinstrom locked 31-year-old Annegret B. in the dungeon. He cleared her accounts, tortured and abused her sexually, recording her torture on tape and photos until he killed and dismembered her after about four weeks. Outside the basement, Reinstrom led the life of a blameless and affable family man. Although the police, at the behest of Annegret's mother, an acquaintance of her daughter and a potential whistleblower, interviewed Reinstrom, but due to the fact that he knew the interviewing police officer from a swimming club they attended, he persuaded the man that he knew nothing and further investigations were omitted. Presumably, Annegret was still alive at the time. Reinstrom had forced his victims to write farewell letters and postcards to their relatives, which were gradually sent from abroad: they wanted to start a new life abroad and no longer wanted any contact. Subsequently, it was recognized that the victims had hidden cries for help in some of the cards. On 6 September 1991, Reinstrom kidnapped 53-year-old Christa S., his teacher's new partner, from her own car and dragged her into his bunker using a stun gun. He handcuffed her and showed her perverse torture photographs of Annegret. Reinstrom demanded 300,000 marks in ransom. However, since the transfer was delayed and his wife had prematurely come home from vacation, he gave up his plan and took Christa to the police station in Langenhorn on September 13th.  Discoveries  Reinstrom was then arrested on 17 September 1991, sentenced on 26 May 1992 to three years imprisonment for extortion and robbery. At the trial, detective Atzeroth-Freier testified. She was brought in on the night of 13-14 September, to bring Christa S. home after her police interrogation. In a break from negotiations, the officer was approached by the mother of Annegret. She reported the disappearance of her daughter, who was a friend of Reinstrom. Atzeroth-Freier then requested the authorities to interrogate the victims' relatives, make lists of items they had lost and, in part of their spare time, to determine that the homicide division to which they belonged investigate their disappearances, as the three cases had striking parallels. During the search of Reinstrom's weekend property in Basedow and in Rahlstedt, the body-tracking dogs at first were unable to locate any body parts. On 21 November 1992, at the Dompfaffenweg, five canisters of hydrochloric acid were found. Neighbours in Basedow reported that Reinstrom had dug a deep pit there some time after Annegret's disappearance. When the police approached it with heavy equipment, on 1 December 1992, they were able to recover a barrel full of human remains. Cofronted with this, Reinstrom informed the police that he had buried the corpse of Hildegard in acid barrel in Dompfaffenweg, which was seized on December 4, 1992.  Trial  The main trial before the jury under chairman Gerhard Schaberg began on 10 January 1995. The accused Reinstrom denied any guilt in the death of the two women and on the recommendation of his three defenders (Leonore Gottschalk-Solger, Klaus Martini and Uwe Maeffert), he largely remained silent. He claimed that an \\"organ mafia\\" killed women to obtain transplant material, or that Hildegard unfortunately had broken her neck while falling down the stairs. Finally, he claimed that Annegret had died in the sauna when, after consensual sexual intercourse, she had bitten his penis violently, so that he pushed her no less violently and left her to bleed and take care of the bleeding limb in the sauna. The jury found it necessary to commission the medical examiner Klaus P√ºschel with the investigation of the defendant on any bite injuries.The secrets of the dead. After 93 days of negotiations, on 22 May 1996, the jury handed down a sentence containing the most severe penalties foreseen in German criminal law: life imprisonment for a special severity of guilt and preventative detention. Unlike the case of Annegret, in the case of Hildegard the court found it impossible to have been killed for sexual reasons; Reinstrom had killed out of murder lust or for satisfaction of his sexual urges, but to be regarded as proven, the killing was made out at least out of greed and to cover a criminal offence.Legal medicine on perpetrator hunt.

The green LIL sign is still visible on the left side of building 2001. After groundbreaking for the LEP Collider had taken place in September 1983, the design for its injection scheme, the LEP Pre-Injector (LPI), was finalized in 1984. The construction was planned and implemented in close collaboration with Laboratoire de l'acc√©l√©rateur lin√©aire (LAL) in Orsay, France. Since there had been no electron/positron accelerators at CERN before, LAL was a valuable source of expertise and experience in this regard.CERN Document Server  D. J. Warner: New and Proposed Linacs at CERN: The LEP (e+/e-) Injector and the SPS Heavy Ion (Pb) Injector (1988) Retrieved on 24 July 2018 The first electron beam with an energy of 80 keV was produced on May 23, 1985.CERN bulletin n¬∞ 24 (1985) Retrieved on 30 July 2018 LIL injected electrons with an energy of 500 MeV into EPA from July 1986 on, and soon after EPA reached its design intensity. The same was achieved for positrons in April 1987, so the LPI-complex was fully operational in 1987.https://www.researchgate.net/publication/257069402_Fifty_years_of_the_CERN_Proton_Synchrotron_Volume_2 For the following two years, the accelerating system was further commissioned, threading the electron and positron beams through LIL, EPA, the Proton Synchrotron (PS), the Super Proton Synchrotron (SPS), until finally reaching LEP. The first injection into LEP's ring was achieved on July 14, 1989, one day earlier than originally scheduled. The first collisions were performed on August 13 and the first physics run, allowing LEP's experiments to take data, took place on September 20.CERN Document Server  S. Myers: The LEP Collider, from design to approval and commissioning (1990) Retrieved on 30 July 2018 LPI was serving as a source of electrons and positrons for LEP from 1989 until November 7, 2000, when the last beams were delivered to LEP. Nevertheless, the source continued to operate for other experiments until April 2001 (see section below). After this, work begun to convert LPI facility to be used for the CLIC Test Facility 3 (CTF3), which conducted preliminary research and development for the future Compact Linear Collider (CLIC). The conversion happened in stages, with the first stage (so-called Preliminary Phase) starting accelerator commissioning in September 2001.CERN Document Server  G. Geschonke and A. Ghigo (editors): CTF3 Design Report (2002) Retrieved on 31 July 2018 At the end of 2016, CTF3 stopped its operation. From 2017 on, it was transformed into the CERN Linear Electron Accelerator for Research (CLEAR).Official CLEAR Homepage Retrieved on 31 July 2018 Operation LPI comprised the LEP Injector Linac (LIL), which had two parts (LIL V and LIL W), as well as the Electron Positron Accumulator (EPA). LIL consisted of two linear accelerators in tandem, having a total length of approximately 100 meters. First, at the starting point of LIL V, electrons with an energy of 80 keV were created by a thermionic gun.G. McMonagle et al: The Long-Term Performance of the S-Band Klystron Modulator System in the CERN LEP Pre- Injector (2000) Retrieved on 30 July 2018 LIL V then accelerated electrons at high currents to an energy of around 200 MeV. These were either accelerated further or used to create positrons, their antiparticles. At the beginning of LIL W, which followed directly behind LIL V, the electrons were shot onto a tungsten target, where the positrons were produced. In LIL W, both the electrons and positrons could then be accelerated to 500 MeV at lower currents than in LIL V. In the initial reports, LIL was designed to reach beam energies of 600 MeV. However, during the first months of operation, it became clear that an output energy of 500 MeV allowed for a more reliable running of the machine. LIL consisted of so-called S band Linacs. These linear accelerators used a 35 MW pulsed klystron that drove microwave cavities at a frequency of 3 GHz, which accelerated the electrons and positrons. After passing through LIL, the particles were injected into EPA, electrons rotating clockwise and positrons counterclockwise. There, both particle types were accumulated to achieve sufficient beam intensities and to match the high frequency output of LIL (100 Hz) to the frequency at which the PS operated (approximately 0.8 Hz). After passing EPA, the particles were delivered to the PS and SPS for further acceleration, before they reached their final destination, LEP.CERN Document Server  F. Dupont: Status of the LEP (e+/e-) Injector Linacs (1984) Retrieved on 30 July 2018 EPA had a circumference of 125.7 m, which corresponded to exactly one fifth of PS' circumference.CERN Document Server  S. Gilardoni, D. Mangluki: Fifty years of the CERN Proton Synchrotron Vol. II (2013) Retrieved on 10 July 2018 Other experiments LPI didn't just provide electrons and positrons to LEP, but also fed different experiments and test installations located directly at LPI's infrastructure. The first of these was the Hippodrome Single Electron (HSE) experiment. The unusual request for single electrons was made in March 1988 by the L3 collaboration. By the end of 1988, the setup was running, allowing for a precise calibration of the L3 detector, which was to be installed at LEP soon after.CERN Document Server  B. Frammery et al.: Single Electron Beams from the LEP Pre-Injector (1989) Retrieved on 31 July 2018 Those particles that were not deflected into EPA when coming from LIL, were directed straight into a \\"dump line\\". There, in the middle of the EPA ring, the LIL Experimental Area (LEA) was set up. The electrons coming there were used for many different applications throughout LIL's operation, testing and preparing LEP's and later LHC's detectors. Most famously, the optical fibres for one of CMS's calorimeters were tested here in 2001 during the preparation time of the LHC.CERN Bulletin 20/2001: LPI goes out on a high note Retrieved on 31 July 2018 Additionally, the two Synchrotron Light Facilities SLF 92 and SLF 42 used the synchrotron radiation emitted by the electrons that were circling EPA. Until the beginning of 2001, the effects of synchrotron radiation on LHC's vacuum chambers were studied at SLF 92 with the COLDEX experiment.CERN Document Server  V.

It was in June 2005 that he was sentenced to life imprisonment with subsequent preventative detention for the sexual abuse and murder of two children. In addition, it can not be completely ruled out that Hoffmann is possibly responsible for more, until today unresolved sexual offenses and murders.Mordfall Levke ‚Äì ‚ÄûEr war einfach nicht gesegnet‚Äú, Stern, 2004, April 1, 2012Gerichtsurteil ‚Äì H√∂chststrafe f√ºr Kinderm√∂rder Hoffmann, Stern, 2005, April 1, 2012  Life  = Childhood and Youth = Marc Hoffmann was born the son of a former sailor and a nurse in Plettenberg in the Sauerland. He first grew up as an only child in Plettenberg, before his family relocated to the small village of Nuttmecke near Attendorn in 1980, where he and his parents lived in a shared home with his grandparents. Hoffmann was teased during his school years due to his strong preponderance, his bow-legs and a speech disorder rendering him an outsider. After completing elementary school, Hoffmann attended secondary school. His academic achievements were below average, which is why he had to repeat a grade in both elementary and secondary school. At the age of 16, Hoffmann dropped out of secondary school after completing the eight grade. = Adulthood = Hoffmann was unemployed for three years after leaving school, and from 1992 onwards worked as a warden at the Attendorner Bauhof for eleven months. Hoffmann spent his spare time increasingly playing first-person shooters, at this time also developing a fondness for violence and horror films. Hoffmann soon discovered his sexually sadistic inclinations and began to torment and kill frogs and mice that he himself caught. In 1993, Hoffmann did his military service with the Bundeswehr. After completing his service he returned to Nuttmecke, where he was temporarily active in the local Neo-Nazi scene, but only remained a Mitl√§ufer. At the age of 20 he had a relationship with a young woman from a neighbouring town, who brought a certificate showing that they had a daughter in 1994. Attempted rape and indictments In February 1994, Hoffmann first emerged as a sex offender when he wanted to rape a 17-year-old hitchhiker in a remote forest. Because Hoffmann was a confessor and also had no previous criminal record, he was in the course of a subsequent lawsuit a \\"positive social prediction\\" was certified, so that the two-year prison sentence was suspended. His girlfriend, however, separated from him as a result.Mordf√§lle Levke/Felix: Schluderte die Polizei?, RP-Online, 2005, April 1, 2012 In 1995, Hoffmann moved from Nuttmecke to Bremerhaven together with his parents, grandparents and daughter. Shortly after the move, however, his father died of Creutzfeldt-Jakob disease. After his father's death Hoffmann began training as a plumber, but after failing the final exam twice he dropped out of training. After her worked for the German Red Cross as a paramedic at major events for five years, he met his future wife, whom he soon married. From the year 2000 Hoffmann worked for a security company in Bremerhaven, where he regulated bus tickets. During this time, he was again accused of raping a 17-year-old, whom he had met while working. This trial was discontinued for lack of evidence. In 2002, his wife gave birth to a daughter. The marriage was in crisis because his wife suspected him of unfaithfulness. Hoffmann had a passion for driving aimlessly over long distances, presumably to relieve emotional tensions. Therefore, his wife increasingly complained about the monthly high spending of gasoline. She also suspected her husband of regularly visiting Bremerhaven's \\"baby street\\". In June 2003, Hoffmann lost his job with the Bremerhaven security company and was unemployed from then on, which further increased his aimless driving around. His wife separated from him in the spring of 2004 and moved out of the apartment with their daughter, while Hoffmann stayed there with his older daughter.  Murders  On May 6, 2004, Hoffmann was in the Cuxhaven district of Altenwalde when he happened to meet 8-year-old Levke S., who was waiting outside his parents' house, as he wheeled aimlessly around in his car. He lured the girl into his car with false promises and carried her to a wooden area where he sexually abused the child and then strangled her with a zip tie. After the murder, Hoffmann searched for a place to hide the corpse several times before choosing the immediate vicinity of his hometown. The now skeletonized body of Levke was discovered in late August 2004 by a mushroom collector. Undeterred by the massive manhunt for Levke's murderer, Hoffmann apparently continued the search for new victims. On October 30, 2004, during one of his aimless tours, he met 8-year-old Felix W. from Ebersdorf, Rotenburg, who was riding his bicycle. Similar to Levke, Hoffmann lured the boy into his car and drove to a nearby forest. After waiting for the onset of darkness, Hoffmann abused and then strangled the boy with his bare hands, throwing the body into the Geeste river at Bremerhaven. The corpse was found on January 7, 2005, after a note from Hoffmann, who had been arrested, and had confessed that he \\"tied up him as a package\\" and thrown his body into the river.Fall Levke und Felix: Hoffmann voll schuldf√§hig?, RP-Online, 2005, April 1, 2012Soko weist Pannen in den Mordf√§llen Levke und Felix zur√ºck, Hamburger Morgenpost, 2005, April 1, 2012Polizei f√ºhrt Hoffmann zur Fundstelle der Leiche von Adelina, RP-Online, 2005, April 1, 2012Prozess nach den Morden an Levke und Felix, Hamburger Morgenpost, 2005, April 2, 2012Levke und Felix ‚Äì Hoffmann schweigt vor Gericht, Focus, 2005, April 1, 2012  Arrest, trial and condemnation  Hoffmann was arrested on the evening of December 8, 2004 in connection with the murders of Levke and Felix. On the same day he confessed to the murder of Levke. On January 7, 2005, he also confessed to Felix's murder to his lawyers. On May 9, 2005, the lawsuit against Hoffmann was opened in the Stade district court.Wir haben ihn, Welt, 2004, April 1, 2012 The family of Levke appeared in the trial as co-plaintiffs. Hoffmann remained silent during the whole process, and all statements on his part were read by his lawyers. On June 29, 2005, the Stade County Court sentenced Hoffmann to life imprisonment for the sexual abuse and murder of the two children. In addition, a particular severity of debt was determined, for which Hoffmann was also ordered preventative detention. Thus, it is possible that Hoffmann may never leave prison again. The chairman of the assizes, Berend Appelkamp, justified the verdict that Hoffmann \\"inflicted unimaginable suffering\\" on others. Hoffmann accepted the verdict without apparent emotion. Hoffmann is currently serving his life sentence in the Oldenburg prison.Gest√§ndnis ‚Äì Mordfall Levke ist aufgekl√§rt, Stern, 2004, April 1, 2012  Personality  The witnesses resolutely described his mother as someone who should haven taken better care of him, and Hoffmann was considered a mama's boy. Contemporary witnesses described him as an intelligent \\"grobian\\" (boorish individual) with little empathy. With regard to his sexual experiences, Hoffmann was regarded as a \\"late bloomer\\", especially since in his teens, unlike his peers, he was hardly able to establish ties to the opposite sex. The fact that Hoffmann was born with only one testicle was certainly a major reasons for his inhibitions. In this context, he increasingly consumed pornography as a teenager. In the course of his psychiatric exam, Hoffmann was classified as \\"not mentally ill\\" and therefore could not apply for the insanity defense. According to these reports, he was neither sadistic nor a pedophile. In this regard, the reviewers came to the realization that Hoffmann merely saw the children as simple sacrifices, and that he was attested for a \\"massive lack of emotionality and compassion\\".  Possible other crimes  With regard to other possible crimes, the murder of 10-year-old Adelina in Bremen in June 2001, which remains unsolved, has been and is still considered. Hoffmann was questioned and pressured to confess by the to the girl's murder in September 2005, but to this day he denies involvement. However, he allegedly has confessed to the murder to a cellmate. Furthermore, Hoffmann also allegedly confessed to a fellow prisoner to six more sexually motivated murders. According to media reports, this is supposed to refer to two children killed in East Germany, two hitchhikers and two older women. Although he did in fact tell his cellmate this, Hoffmann claims it was all fictitious.Der Doppelmord passt nicht ins Bild, Stern, 2005, April 1, 2012 Even the unexplained for many years murder of 8-year-old Johanna from Hesse, who disappeared on September 2, 1999, is sometimes associated with Hoffmann. The body was found seven months later. On October 26, 2017, it was announced that a partly-confessed suspect has been arrested for her murder, and thus Hoffmann was eliminated as a suspect.Levke-Prozess: Hoffmann deutet Mord an alter Frau an, Stern, 2005, April 1, 2012 During his remand, Hoffmann allegedly hinted to officials about the murder of an old woman in his home village. Because in 1994 an 86-year-old woman disappeared without a trace, Hoffmann is considered associated with this case. Hoffmann was also increasingly associated with the so-called Schullandheim murders, which remained unexplained for a long time. These, however, were found to be the work of another sex offender. While imprisoned in the Oldenburg prison, Hoffmann allegedly confessed to an informant to the rape of two women.  Police allegations  According to the police officers, Hoffmann was considered a special criminal due to choosing both girls and boys as victims. The investigating authorities in the murders cases of Levke and Felix were accused after Hoffmann's capture of ignoring evidence. Seven weeks before Felix's murder, evidence of Hoffmann's alleged perpetration in the Levke case became available. However, corresponding testimonies were viewed as insufficient, and the police continue to reject such claims.Mordprozess: ‚Äû‚Ä¶danach f√ºr Kinder entschieden‚Äú, Focus, 2005, April 1, 2012 In May 2010, the former special commissioner for the Levke case, G√ºnter K√∂nig-Kruse, admitted to the Nordsee-Zeitung that on June 13, 16 and 29, Hoffmann had returned to the parking lot where he had thrown away Levke's satchel and jacked, where he was filmed by video cameras positioned by the police. This was around four months before Felix's disappearance. However, because the video recordings did not come to a police file until November 29, about three weeks after Felix's death, nothing could be done. In addition, a longtime acquaintance of Hoffmann's, a police officer who was present and was faced with suspicions it Hoffmann could indeed be Levke's murderer. The next day she made an official statement to the police, especially after confessing to knowing about Hoffmann's criminal record for rape.Levke-Mord: Unausgewertete Hinweise, S√ºddeutsche Zeitung, 2010, April 1, 2012  References   External links  Uwe Ruprecht: Child trap on the move Category:1973 births Category:Living people Category:2004 crimes Category:German serial killers Category:Male serial killers Category:Prisoners sentenced to life imprisonment by Germany Category:2000s murders in Germany Category:2004 crimes in Germany Category:2004 murders in Europe ","title":"Marc Hoffmann (sex offender)"},{"id":"58053332","text":"The 2018 Bretagne Classic Ouest‚ÄìFrance was a road cycling one-day race that took place on 26 August 2018 in France.

They were sparked by the deaths of two high-school students in Dhaka struck by a bus operated by an unlicensed driver who was racing to collect passengers. The incident impelled students to demand safer roads and stricter traffic laws, and the demonstrations rapidly spread throughout Bangladesh. The protests were peaceful until 2 August, when police attempted to disperse the demonstrators with tear gas and people believed to be members of a pro-government youth league attacked protesters and journalists. The government arrested several protesters and a photographer for giving an interview about the protests to international media. Various international organisations and high-profile figures expressed solidarity with the protesters. The crack-down on the student protesters received high criticism both domestically and internationally. The third Sheikh Hasina Cabinet approved on 6 August a draft traffic act stipulating capital punishment for intentional killing and a maximum five-year prison sentence for accidental killing with a motor vehicle. The protesters felt that the maximum five-year sentence was too light for accidental deaths due to reckless driving. By 8 August, the situation in the city had returned to normal, most students had returned to their classes and traffic had resumed as normal, with many sources stating that the nine-day protests were over.https://bdnews24.com/bangladesh/2018/08/10/dhaka-traffic-chaos-returns- as-campaign-for-safe-roads-peters-outhttp://southasiajournal.net/bangladesh- students-started-an-enduring-movement-even-as-street-protests-end/  Background  Bus services in Dhaka are notoriously unregulated and accident- prone. Although many traffic laws and regulations were passed by the parliament, it had not been put into action. Research by the National Committee to Protect Shipping, Roads and Railways showed that more than 4,200 people were killed and 16,100 others were injured in road accidents in Dhaka in 2017. It is estimated that approximately 2.4 million vehicles are being driven by unqualified drivers in Dhaka in 2018. The deaths of two students had led to these protests. alt=  Protests  left The protests started on 29 July 2018 after two students of Shaheed Romijuddin Cantonment College were killed when a speeding bus ploughed into a bus stop on Airport Road, Dhaka. The vehicle had been racing another bus to pick up passengers when it drifted onto the sidewalk, killing the two and injuring 12 others. Hundreds of students poured into the streets demanding justice for the incident. The bus responsible for the crash was run by Jabal-e-Nur Paribahan and owned by Shahadat Hossain, who was later arrested. It was later revealed that three buses were involved in the incident. All three drivers were arrested, along with two assistants. Hours later, journalists spoke with Shajahan Khan, Bangladeshi Minister of Shipping, who is also the Executive President of Bangladesh Road Transport Workers Federation, who said, \\"a road crash has claimed 33 lives in India's Maharashtra; but do they talk about it like the way we do?\\" His remark and smile were highly criticised by citizens and triggered protests in other areas of the country, and the protesters started demanding his apology. The protests then spread outside Dhaka. The protesters, mostly students aged 15 to 19, blocked roads at major points and checked the legal documents and fitness certificates of different vehicles at different points throughout the country. The students declared 9 demands. Members of civil rights organisations expressed solidarity with protests. The protests continued for a fifth day despite the government's declaration that all educational institutions would remain closed countrywide on 2 August 2018.Bangladeshis of various age groups protesting for safe roads Ilias Kanchan, a Bangladeshi film actor, road safety activist and founder of the Nirapad Sarak Chai campaign, expressed solidarity with the protests by initiating a human chain in Dhaka on 3 August. On 5 August, Dhaka University students blocked Shahbag Square demanding Shahjahan's resignation, before proceeding to Science Lab Square, where police attempted to disperse them with tear gas. Dozens of students were injured and several journalists were beaten up by pro-government activists. On 6 August 2018, demonstrations were held in different parts of the country by students of the private and public universities. In Dhaka, police used tear gas and rubber bullets to disperse the protesters, and approximately 40 students were injured and 10 people were arrested from the nearby area of the private university campuses. On 7 August 2018, hundreds of journalists formed a large human chain outside the National Press Club demanding punishment for attacks by BCL activists on journalists while covering the news of the protests, and also demanding punishment for attacks on the student protesters. Following arrests of some of the student protesters, BRAC University students boycotted class on 8 August demanding release of the detained protesters, while Professor Abdul Mannan Choudhury, Vice-Chancellor of World University of Bangladesh also asked the government to release the protesters. No further protests have been reported since.  Retaliation and attacks on protesters and journalists  Student protesters and journalists collecting news of the protests were attacked by pro- government supporters alleged to be members of Bangladesh Chhatra League (BCL), the student wing of the ruling political party, injuring about 115 students and 15 journalists in Dhaka. One local daily newspaper reported that three of its journalists were beaten and one female journalist was molested by BCL men while covering protests in the Jhigatola area of Dhaka on 4 August. Local journalists also reported having their camera equipment destroyed and phones snatched. They also alleged that they were forced to delete the videos of violence from their mobile phone. Bangladesh Police fired tear gas and rubber bullets and used batons to disperse the protesters leaving many people injured. The police and the road transport minister Obaidul Quader rejected all allegations of attack on the protesters. One top leader of the ruling Bangladesh Awami League alleged that some criminals wearing school uniforms had joined the violence, but this was unconfirmed. Photographer alt= Posts on social media alleged that four female students of Bir Shreshtha Noor Mohammad Public College were taken to Bangladesh Awami League office and raped by BCL activists; however, these reports remain unconfirmed and have been denied by BCL leadership. Some of the alleged incidents, including rape, were later described as rumours that spread over social media. On 4 August, a group of armed men riding motorcycles attacked an official car carrying Marcia Bernicat, the US ambassador to Bangladesh, although nobody was injured. On 5 August, police used tear gas again to disperse thousands of school, college and university students. Prime Minister Sheikh Hasina urged the protesters to go home and expressed concern that a \\"third party\\" could sabotage the protests and put the safety of students at risk. At least six photojournalists, including photojournalists of Associated Press, The Daily Bonik Barta, Janakantha, a photography student of Pathshala South Asian Media Institute as well as freelance photojournalists, were attacked with iron rods, machetes and sticks in Dhaka by activists of BCL. Law enforcement was present for the incident, but did not make any attempt to stop the attackers. The attackers tried to snatch the victims' camera and phones, threatening to attack anyone who possessed a camera. Following a live interview about the protests with Al Jazeera, photographer Shahidul Alam was detained by a group of between 30 and 35 plainclothes police officers on 5 August. Alam was charged under Section 57 of the Information and Communication Technology Act and was remanded for seven days. He told the court that he had been tortured while in police custody. The Supreme Court halted the seven-day remand on 7 August and after observing his physical condition ordered authorities to admit him to a hospital.https://www.thedailystar.net/news/city/jail-authorities-asked-to- admit-photographer-shahidul-alam-bsmmu-for-treatment-1617196 Alam was taken to a hospital on 8 August at 9 am. However, Alam was taken back to the office of the Detective Branch of police again at 2 pm on the same day. More 5 people have been detained by the Bangladesh Police including Mahabubur Rahaman Arman, a human rights activist, and cybersecurity and crime analyst who was charged under Section 57 of the Information and Communication Technology Act and was remanded for six days. Others were remanded for 3‚Äì5 days in the same Act during that time. On 6 August, East West University students who had blocked the road in front of the University in late morning protests were attacked by a group of men carrying sticks. Local residents stated that the labour union wing of the ruling party, the \\"Shecchashebok League\\" activists,https://www.justice.gov/sites/default/files/eoir/legacy/2013/11/07/BGD41828.FE.pdf were among the attackers. Police also fired tear gas shells to disperse the protesters. Prothom Alo correspondent Nasrin Akhtar Shumi, who recorded the violence on her phone, had her phone snatched away by the police who took her to the local police outpost and erased the video recording. Police were also alleged to have sought assistance from pro-government youths to deal with the protesters. Relatives of the protesters expressed their dismay when 22 private university students involved in the protests were detained by the police on 7 August, but no legal action was taken on the alleged ruling party activists who attacked the protesters. On 8 August, police raided the Bashundhara Residential Area in Dhaka, where a number of private university students reside, but no one was arrested during the operation.  Official response  Although no official statement was published by the Prime Minister Sheikh Hasina, Home Minister Asaduzzaman Khan Kamal said at a press briefing on 2 August that the prime minister had requested students to stop protesting on the streets and return to their schools. The Ministry of Education advised all educational institutions to remain closed on 2 August in order to control the ongoing wave of student agitation. Education Minister Nurul Islam Nahid said that this decision was taken based on security concerns. The Cyber Crime Unit of Dhaka Metropolitan Police filed cases against 29 individuals and online news portals for sharing news and media related to the protests at the Ramna Police Station. Private television channel Ekattor TV was issued a letter of warning by the Information Ministry after it aired footage of student protests on national television. On 3 August, the government donated a savings certificate of 2 million BDT to each of the families of the students who died in the bus accident. On 4 August, the government blocked mobile internet access for 24 hours in response to supposed misinformation circulating online. Internet service providers were ordered to reduce the mobile internet speed to 1.28 kbit/s to prevent upload of pictures or videos to the internet. Home Minister Asaduzzaman Khan announced that police would take \\"tough action\\" against the agitating students \\"\\". On 5 August, 3G and 4G cellular networks were again reportedly blocked by authorities in an attempt to control the mass spread of misinformation online, resulting in a temporary communication black- out. On 6 August, a new traffic act was approved at a cabinet meeting, proposing capital punishment for intentional killing and five years prison for accidental killing with a motor vehicle. Bus owners took the decision to put contract drivers on monthly payroll. They commented: \\"The drivers move recklessly so that they can earn extra on an additional trip when they can. If they get a monthly salary, their mentality of rash driving will change.\\" The announcement came on 8 August and had been set to be enforced from 1 September 2018.  Aftermath  In response to the protests, national authorities launched \\"Traffic Week\\", a week-long road-safety program. On its first day, 5 August, 19,366 cases were filed for traffic rule violators, with 25,882 more recorded the following day. Bangladesh police filed 34 cases against protesters and arrested at least 37 of them. No charges were filed against the attackers over attacks on protesters and journalists. Photographer Shahidul Alam was detained for interrogation and remanded by police due to his social media activity on the protest; Amnesty International condemned the arrest. In retaliation to the arrest of protesters, Noakhali District's Noakhali University on 9 August announced its indefinite closure until all protesters were released. According to an official in the cyber crime division of the Dhaka metropolitan police, up to 1,200 social media accounts have been identified to allegedly spread rumours. In addition to police officers, members of pro-government youth league BCL, also asked followers to send examples of anyone allegedly spreading rumours. Posts featuring the names and pictures of alleged activists including four women were spread across Facebook and Instagram. These actions have made many students in Dhaka to panic and made them stop posting about the protests online. There are also reports of terrified students deleting their online messages of support to the protests. On 9 August, Dhaka University authority handed over one of their student to police with the assistance of pro-government youth league BCL for his Facebook posts. Dhaka Metropolitan Police (DMP) scrutinised over 1,500 profiles on different social media and launched legal action against 150 such profile holders for their alleged involvement in instigating anarchy during the movement.  International response  The United Nations expressed concern for the safety of Bangladeshi children and young people in the protests. The US Embassy in Dhaka issued a statement condemning the actions taken against the student protesters. London-based Save the Children urged the government to meet the demands of the students and to ensure the safety of the protesting students. The High Commission of Canada to Bangladesh also expressed Canada's concern for the safety of the students exercising their rights and called for action against \\"those violating these democratic rights\\". Amnesty International also released a statement, calling for the release of activist and photographer Shahidul Alam and for an end to the crackdown on student protesters. Similarly, PEN International issued a statement demanding the immediate release of the photographer. Indian writer Arundhati Roy, Canadian author Naomi Klein, American writer philosopher Noam Chomsky and Indian intellectual Vijay Prashad also demanded immediate release of photographer Alam in a joint statement. RSF urged the government to protect those involved in the freedom of the press. Swedish Foreign Affairs Minister Margot Wallstr√∂m voiced her concern regarding the violent scenes witnessed in Dhaka and called for the respect of the right to peacefully protest. The European Union also expressed concern over the attacks on students and journalists. New York-based Human Rights Watch criticised the Bangladesh government for \\"unlawfully attacking\\" student protesters and locking up people for \\"peaceful criticism\\".

Early life She was born 14 December 1779 and baptised as Sarah Carr Wilkinson. Her parents were Hannah and William. Wilkinson was born in and remained in the middle class throughout her life, often on the cusp of poverty. In 1788, John Marshall published Midsummer Holydays; or, A Long Story. The book is credited to Wilkinson, a claim substantiated in the publication of Visits to the Parsonage; or, the Juvenile Assembly. Furthermore, Wilkinson wanted to work with literature since she was young. Wilkinson made early connections through reading to Lady Charlotte Finch, who was blind.  Adult life  Wilkinson lived in London for the majority of her life. In 1806 she resided in Soho, and in Westminster in 1807. In 1818, she lived near Maidenhead in Berkshire. She is said to have had a husband named Scadgell, described as \\"nebulous\\", who died in 1818, and had a daughter Amelia, born around 1807. For some years she earned an income from a circulating library, acquired with the financial and networking assistance of Lady Charlotte Finch, but this failed after 1811. She took in boarders, taught at Whitechapel Free School in Gower's Walk in eastern London, later served as mistress at Bray in Berkshire, and started a day-school herself. In 1818, she requested and received financial support from the Royal Literary Fund, an amount varying between two and five pounds. In 1820, at the time struggling to support herself with a parlour shop as well as selling tape and picture books for children, she was diagnosed with breast cancer. In 1821, she resumed writing and editing. She nearly ended up in debtors' prison due to breaking a window. She again petitioned the Royal Literary Fund for aid, citing the difficulty of earning income as a female; furthermore, her publishers backed her petitions by attesting to her hard work as well as the suffering of the publishing industry. Sarah Wilkinson's daughter, Amelia, obtained work in a lady's household. In 1824, the Royal Literary Fund provided five pounds towards her medical care; as a result, she underwent two surgeries in St. George's Hospital. Sarah Wilkinson died in St Margaret's Workhouse, Westminster, on 19 March 1831. Writing career Wilkinson wrote about 50 chapbooks, a third of which were adaptations of existing romances; a few original novels, including The Thatched Cottage; and a school textbook and various other works for children. She also wrote articles in periodicals and created songs and short writings for Valentine's Day. Between 1800 and 1820, Wilkinson created about 103 works, all in English; however, some books, such as \\"Historical Reveries by a Suffolk Villager\\" were published after she died. The Tragical History of Miss Jane Arnold, Commonly called Crazy Jane (1818) was reprinted many times and is described as \\"an ostensibly moral tale of seduction, madness, and suicide, ... very popular on the northern provincial circuit\\". Various people published her books, including Tabart, Richard Phillips, and W. Darton. Oftentimes, Sarah Wilkinson signed her books \\"S.W.\\" She also published in Ladies Monthly Museum. Many of her works are abridgments of novels by authors such as Henry Fielding, Matthew Lewis, Walter Scott, Ann Radcliffe, Amelia Opie, and James Porter. Wilkinson dedicated novels; for example, The Fugitive Countess contained a dedication to Mary Champion de Crespigny. For her gothic fiction she was described as \\"one of the most productive and gifted of female fiend-mongers\\". Her literary style combined a more gothic style with mainstream writing. Her Valentine's verses gave women more social liberty in reaching out to men whom they loved. Her work often satirized Ann Radcliffe's work as well as ghostly figures, and her female characters often found themselves socially isolated.

It is the largest port on the eastern seaboard of the United Arab Emirates and the world second largest bunkering hub. History Construction of the port started on 1978 as part of the economic development of Fujairah and container operations commenced in 1982. The port assumed full operation on 1983. Two oil terminals were also constructed on the port. The first oil terminal commenced operation in January 2006 while the second oil terminal commenced operation in June 2010. On the morning of 12 May 2019 a pro-Hezbollah news channel Al Mayadeen falsely reported that seven oil tankers were involved in an explosion in the Port of Fujairah. The news report was quickly picked up by Press TV and other news outlets. The United Arab Emirates denied any explosions on the port and stated that the port continues to operate normally. The UAE Ministry of Foreign Affairs and International Cooperation later released a statement that four ships off the port of Fujairah in UAE territorial waters were targeted in a \\"sabotage attack\\". One ship was flying the UAE flag and another was flying the Norwegian flag while two Saudi oil tankers were also among the targeted ships. No casualties were reported and no oil or chemical spills occurred. The UAE requested assistance from the US in launching an investigation probe to determine the cause of the damage. The assessment determined that holes near or below all the ships water line were likely caused by explosive charges. The US military team that assessed the blasts initial investigation blamed Iran or Iranian-backed proxies of causing the attack. The US issued new warnings to commercial ship of acts of sabotage targeting ships in the Middle East. Port facilities The port has two bulk loaders for exports, the first loader is capable of loading 2,000 tons per hour while the second loader is capable of loading 4,000 tons per hour. The port consists of two breakwater berths; a southern and a northern breakwater berth. The southern breakwater berth has of general cargo berth and a draft of . The southern breakwater berth is the common site for repairing vessels and has a travel lift facility for vessel maintenance and repair. The northern breakwater berth hosts two oil terminals. The port is expanding its operational capacity to enable the handling of larger vessels and provide more services. The port is expected to install advanced cargo lifting equipment by 2021. The port is connected to the Etihad Rail linking the industrial city of Ruwais in the western region of the UAE to the town of Ghuwaifat close to the Saudi border and then to Fujairah in the east. The rail in Fujairah is used to carry bulk containers and oil. UAE-based Brooge Petroleum and Gas Investment Company announced plans to set up an oil refinery to produce bunker fuel with a capacity of 250,000 barrel per day (bpd) in the port. The facility will be the first in the Middle East and North Africa to comply with the new IMO 2020 regulations of the International Maritime Organization by capping sulfur content in shipping fuels. The first phase of the project is expected to be finished in the first quarter of 2020. Strategic location US Navy boat patrolling waters around Port of Fujairah. The Port of Fujairah has a strategic location being connected to all the emirates within and located on the only eastern seaboard of the United Arab Emirates. Fujairah location as a bunkering hub occurred as a result of the Iran‚ÄìIraq War in the 1980s, when the Strait of Hormuz was mined by the Iranian military and tankers were targeted by Iran. As the United States launched Operation Earnest Will to protect oil tankers from being targeted, vessels lined up to enter the Persian Gulf in convoys and Fujairah was established as a anchorage for tankers and a bunkering hub. Due to the increasing Iranian threats of closing the Strait of Hormuz to international shipping, in July 2012 the UAE began using the new Habshan‚ÄìFujairah oil pipeline from the Habshan fields in Abu Dhabi to the Fujairah oil terminal on the Gulf of Oman, effectively bypassing the Strait of Hormuz. It has a maximum capacity of around 2 million barrels per day, over three-fourths of the UAE's 2012 production rate, effectively allowing the UAE to export oil without concerns of the increasing threats from Iran to close the strait. The UAE is also increasing Fujairah's storage and off-loading capacities. The UAE is building the world's largest crude oil storage facility in Fujairah with a capacity of holding 14 million barrels to enhance Fujairah's growth as a global oil and trading hub. The Habshan ‚Äì Fujairah route secures the UAE's energy security and has the advantage of being a ground oil pipeline transportation which is considered the cheapest form of oil transportation and also reduces insurance costs as oil tankers would no longer enter the Persian Gulf. The port is also a logistical land link to the Port of Jebel Ali, the biggest and busiest port in the Middle East. Security The United Arab Emirates Navy has a naval base located on the port. The Fujairah Naval Base offers protection to oil tankers and ensures the safety of the oil export route.

It was developed by the Human Research and Engineering Directorate (HRED) at the Army Research Laboratory (ARL) to combine the positive aspects of traditional military sand tables with the latest digital technologies to better support soldier training and offer new possibilities of learning. It uses a projector to display a topographical map on top of the sand in a regular sandbox as well as a motion sensor that keeps track of changes in the layout of the sand to appropriately adjust the computer-generated terrain display. An ARL study conducted in 2017 with 52 active duty military personnel (36 males and 16 females) found that the participants who used ARES spent less time setting up the table compared to participants who used a traditional sand table. In addition, ARES demonstrated a lower perceived workload score, as measured using the NASA Task Load Index (NASA-TLX) ratings, compared to the traditional sand table. However, there was no significant difference in post-knowledge test scores in recreating the visual map.  Development  The ARES project was one of the 25 ARL initiatives in development from 1995 to 2015 that focused on visualizing spatial data on virtual or sand table interfaces. It was developed by HRED‚Äôs Simulation and Training Technology Center (STTC) with Charles Amburn as the principal investigator. Collaborations involved with ARES included Dignitas Technologies, Design Interactive (DI), the University of Central Florida‚Äôs Institute for Simulation and Training, and the U.S. Military Academy at West Point. ARES was largely designed to be a tangible user interface (TUI), in which digital information can be manipulated using physical objects such as a person‚Äôs hand. It was constructed using commercial off-the-shelf components, including a projector, a laptop, an LCD monitor, Microsoft‚Äôs Xbox Kinect sensor, and government-developed ARES software. With the projector and Kinect sensor both facing down on the surface of the sandbox, the projector provides a digital overlay over the sand and the Kinect sensor scans the surface of the map to detect any user gestures inside the boundaries of the sandbox. During development, researchers explored the possibility of incorporating ideas such as multi-touch surfaces, 3D holographic displays, and virtual environments. However, budget restrictions limited the implementation of such ideas. On September 2014 during the Modern Day Marine exhibition in Quantico, Virginia, researchers from ARL showcased ARES for the first time.  Uses  According to a 2015 technical report by ARL scientists, ARES is reported to have the following capabilities. * Images, maps, and videos can be projected into the sand table from a top-down point of view in real time. * Terrain and scenarios created in ARES can be imported into different simulation applications, such as Virtual Battlespace 3 (VBS3) and One Semi-Automated Forces (OneSAF). * Military symbols and graphics can be created, labeled, and placed onto the sand table to set up different scenarios. * Visual aids such as color schemes and contour lines can be used to guide users to shaping the sand to replicate a previously saved 3D terrain. * Users can use their hand to navigate the different menus available in ARES as if it was the mouse. * The ARES sensor can detect and track the presence of hand(s) to identify where the user points on the sand table. * A web camera can be used to communicate with other users and provide a top-down view of the sand table to collaborators. * AR-based tablet apps and specially-made note cards can be used to project images of different vehicles on the terrain.

The seamount reaches a depth of below sea level and has the appearance of an atoll with a flat top and steep slopes. Some active coral growth takes place at its top, but if it ever was an active atoll it has now drowned. It was probably formed by the Samoa hotspot 24 million years ago, although older volcanism about 40 million years ago has also been identified.  Geology and geomorphology  = Local = Alexa Bank rises to depths of , has an eastward elongated flat top and is long and wide, widening towards the west; such dimensions resemble these of Savaii and Upolu in Samoa. The flat top has some features of an atoll including a raised rim, and it may indeed once have been an atoll. The rim is surrounded by a narrow terrace and in turn encloses a much wider terrace, that surrounds the flat top at an average depth of . The northern and southern flanks are formed by steep scarps, with the eastern slope featuring a terrace at depth and the western slope extending as a long volcanic ridge. The upper of the Bank are formed by carbonate sediments, while the eastern slope terrace may be part of the original volcanic edifice that was carried to this depth by thermal subsidence of the oceanic crust; seismic data may support the existence of a volcano within the carbonate sediments that form the bulk of Alexa Bank as well. Such thicknesses of the sediments are comparable to these of Bikini Atoll and Eniwetok. = Regional = The seafloor around Alexa Bank has a rough relief, with additional seamounts known as the Louisa Bank, Morton Bank, Penguin Bank and Turpie Bank nearby; the last two are often considered to be part of Alexa Bank. The deep Alexa Trough lies west and south of Alexa Bank and is part of the Vitiaz Trench, connecting it with the Tonga Trench. The bank itself is part of the \\"Melanesian Border Plateau\\", a group of seamounts and islands along the Vitiaz Trench that are mostly of volcanic origin. Alexa Bank appears to be the westernmost extension of the Samoa hotspot trail, which has covered a length of at least. The hotspot trail is in part coincident with a large group of islands and seamounts which were probably formed by the same hotspot but also featured substantial postshield volcanism, probably owing to tectonic phenomena triggered by the Tonga Trench close by. The seafloor is part of the Pacific Plate. = Composition = Samples dredged from the Alexa Bank include basaltic rocks and have alkali basalt to tholeiitic composition. Isotope data display affinities to these from other Samoan volcanoes. Other rocks dredged from the seamount are argillite, breccia, shale and siltstone but they may not have originated on Alexa Bank proper.  Geologic history  Rocks from Alexa Bank have been dated to be 37‚Äì36.9 million years old and may be a product of Eocene volcanism. More recent age estimates are 24 million years ago, while fossil data have been inferred to justify a Cretaceous age. Alexa Bank has been considered to be a product of the Samoa hotspot, but its age may be too high to be a product of this hotspot. The newer age measurements however are consistent with the association with the Samoa hotspot. Some tectonic activity may have continued until later times, leading to the development of segmentation and tilting. The bank was probably an atoll during the Pleistocene and then drowned. It is possible that unusually rapid geological subsidence of Alexa Bank outpaced the ability of its reefs to keep up. Originally, the flat surface of Alexa was explained by wave erosion during sea level lowstands.  Biology  Dead corals and foraminifera occur on Alexa Bank. Some corals are still alive and form pinnacles on the surface of the bank. Algal rhodoliths and stromatoliths have been found on Alexa as well. The Japanese snake blenny has been found at Alexa Bank. Radiolarians in Eocene- Quaternary sediments south of Alexa Bank probably originate there.

It is also known as The Screamers for their practice of primal scream therapy. The commune moved to Colombia in 1989, where they increasingly focused on ecological concerns. Two of its members, one a grandson of the founder, were killed by Revolutionary Armed Forces of Colombia (FARC) rebels in 2000.  History  alt=A road between two buildings, one red the other pebbledash, with cars parked on either side. Englishwoman Jenny James (born 1942) established the Atlantis commune in a three-storey house in Burtonport, County Donegal, in 1974, moving there from another primal commune in London. The name 'Atlantis' came from Burtonport's location on the Atlantic coast and from the legend of Atlantis. At any one time around thirty people lived in the commune in \\"Atlantis House\\", which was brightly decorated, with eyes around the windows and symbols on the walls. The group's way of life raised objections and accusations of abuse. They received bomb threats and some members of the D√°il √âireann ‚Äì the lower house of the Irish legislature ‚Äì called for them to be deported. In 1980, the commune relocated to cottages on the island of Inishfree off the coast of Donegal. After a split and two years of traveling, James relocated the commune again in 1989, this time to Colombia near the town of Icononzo in Tolima, where membership peaked at around sixty during the 1990s. James had intended to move to Bolivia, inspired by Che Guevara, but settled on Colombia instead. Inishfree has been uninhabited since 2013. After they left Burtonport the house they used was occupied by a different religious group, the Silver Sisterhood, whom Atlantis had a dispute with over rent in 1992. In 1999, a group of Atlantis members who had moved to Caquet√° were expelled by the Revolutionary Armed Forces of Colombia (FARC), with whom Atlantis had previously co-existed peacefully, followed by the original group near Icononzo. James, with a 15-year-old daughter and an 18-year-old grandson, Tristan, moved to Pacho. In 2000, Tristan James was travelling with another Atlantis member, Javier Nova, aged 19, back to Icononzo. James was planning a gap year in Ireland and wanted to see his half-brother before he left. Both were taken by FARC rebels in a village called Hoya Grande, where they were murdered after a show trial, and their bodies burned. At the time of the murders, some other members of Atlantis, including Nova's mother, Rebecca Garcia, were living on a moored ketch in Baltimore, County Cork, called the Atlantis Adventure.  Lifestyle  The members of Atlantis were known as The Screamers by locals in Burtonport for their practice of primal therapy. The idea of primal screaming was developed and popularised by Arthur Janov, especially in his 1970 book The Primal Scream, the goal being to expunge and prevent repressed emotion. Janov's theory focuses on repressed childhood pain. At Atlantis this was extended to a general, radical emotional honesty, where members would yell at one another. Parts of this approach, which James viewed as therapeutic, also derived from the ideas of Wilhelm Reich. James was a client of Reichian psychotherapist in London before moving to Ireland and Boadella's poems and letters to James feature in her first book, Room to Breathe. In an interview for RT√â show The Live Mike, James claimed that the aggression of this approach was both helpful and healthy, and a counterpoint to a society that \\"puts a premium on mediocrity and niceness, and being sweet and being polite\\". The hostility of the sessions could be intense, with members of the commune pushing one another into being ever more harassing and angry towards one another. On Inishfree and in Colombia, Atlantis focused also on self-sufficiency. In Colombia they established an organic farm and focused increasingly on ecological issues. In an interview in 2002, James stated Atlantis's goals as \\"self-sufficiency, to show ourselves and everyone else that life is possible without technology, without damaging and raping the planet\\" and stressed the importance of physical labour, saying that \\"therapy, sexual freedom for children, no school, political involvement, all flow organically from this basic premise\\". The members of the commune have also practised non-monogamy and \\"free love\\". The \\"sexual freedom for children\\" was elaborated on by James in an interview with The Independent in 2000, where she is quoted as saying: \\"We don't set an age at which a child is a sexual creature. If they want to sleep with each other at nine or 10, that's fine\\".  Atlantis books  In the 1970s and 1980s, Jenny James wrote several books about Atlantis and her ideas: * 323 p. * 184 p. * 173 p. * 132 p. * 262 p. * 248 p. * 259 p. Two later e-books have since been produced: * Atlantis Adventure. The story of James's travels from March 1987 (the Canary Islands) to June 1989 (Colombia) 241 p. *  In culture  A documentary about the commune, The Family, was made for RT√â in 1978 by Bob Quinn, as part of \\"The Other Lives\\" sequence of films about alternative lifestyles. The film was considered too disturbing for broadcast, and was not shown on television until the 1990s. The 2017 TULCA Festival of Visual Art in Galway took the Atlantis commune as its theme, and its name, \\"They Call Us The Screamers\\", from James' 1980 book. The festival included a screening of The Family and thirteen newly- commissioned artworks. The choice to take Atlantis as inspiration caused controversy and the curator, Matt Packer, had to clarify that: \\"The exhibition does not seek to promote or advocate the Atlantis commune\\" because \\"news of the exhibition has nevertheless caused concern and anxiety to some former members that are still affected by their experiences\\". The 31 July 2018 episode of Seriously... on BBC Radio 4, \\"The Silence and the Scream\\", told the story of Atlantis's time in Donegal. It is presented by Garrett Carr, who grew up in Donegal, and includes his interviews with locals who remember the commune's time there.

It was designed and built by the Metropolitan Board of Water Supply and Sewerage. It is also known as Ashfield Reservoir (Elevated) (WS 0003) and WS 0003. The property is owned by Sydney Water (State Government). It was added to the New South Wales State Heritage Register on 15 November 2002.  History  =Indigenous history= =Early European history= The first European land grant in Canterbury was to a \\"very good, pious, inoffensive man\\", the Reverend Richard Johnson (1753-1827), the colony's first chaplain, in 1793. He called his grant Canterbury Vale, as a tribute to Canterbury in England, and the suburb took its name from the farm. The farm extended over the area of modern- day Canterbury and Ashbury suburbs. By 1800, when it was sold to Lieutenant William Cox, the property covered . In 1803, when it covered , it was sold to Robert Campbell the elder (1769-1846), who then bought up most of the land north to Liverpool Road. The village of Canterbury was formed after 1841 subdivision of this land, then owned by Campbell. Sales of the land in the area west of Canterbury Road and north of the railway, were successful, and several other sales followed in the 1840s and 1850s. Although the soil in this area was rather poor, there was some farm cultivation, but the main work was wood cutting and carting, and brickmaking. In 1840 the Australian Sugar Company bought of Campbell's Canterbury estate and a steam engine was installed, but after passing through the hands of several owners, the factory closed in 1856. The first post office opened in 1858, and the first official public school in 1878, and the district slowly developed. Canterbury Race Course, on the northern bank of the Cooks River has been one of Sydney's major racetracks since 1871.

Petersham Reservoir supplied western Sydney and Illawarra suburbs. A pumping station at Carlton lifted water to Penshurst to supply the higher areas of Kogarah. Originally, water from Woollahra Reservoir was fed back to Ashfield Reservoir (1888) to supply the higher areas in Inner West. By 1927 an additional main from Potts Hill supplied Ashfield Reservoir. The reservoir is now supplied by the City Tunnel.  Description  Ashfield Reservoir (Elevated), (WS 3) is one of a group of four similar elevated reservoirs in the Sydney Water system, the others being Bellevue Hill Reservoir (WS 10), 1910, Drummoyne Reservoir (Elevated) (WS 38), 1910, and Penshurst Reservoir (Elevated) (WS 87), 1910. Each reservoir is an elevated cylindrical riveted steel tank, resting on a concrete apron and supported on a steel girder frame. The perimeter of the steel stand has a facade of concrete columns and arches, which forms a decorative, rather than a structural feature. The walkway around the rim of the reservoir is attached to the outside and supported on brackets (decking planks removed). Standard features include: handrail in tubular steel, davit, access ladder, trigonometric station, inlet and outlet valve chambers. At its full service level of , the reservoir has a capacity of .

The film stars husband and wife actors Patrick J. Adams and Troian Bellisario, playing astrophysicist Isaac and itinerant artist Clara, who become close while searching for signs of intelligent life in the universe. The film is grounded in recent technological and theoretical advances, and attracted the attention of astronomers. The film received divided or mixed reviews from critics, and out of a handful of nominations from various bodies, won an award from the Austin Film Festival.  Plot  Dr. Isaac Bruno holds a postdoctoral research fellowship in astrophysics at (fictional) Ontario University, in Toronto. His goal of finding signs of intelligent life in the universe has become an obsession, linked to an unspecified trauma in his personal life two years earlier. He has become increasingly antagonistic towards his students and has taken to misappropriating time on ground-based telescopes in Chile, intended for a colleague's research. His department head suspends him, denying him any access to the school's research facilities. The TESS orbiting telescope is launched, providing enormous amounts of data that is shared with the world, in a community effort to analyze and find possible life on exoplanets. Isaac posts flyers looking for an unpaid research assistant, offering nothing but room and board. His only response is from Clara, an uneducated artist who has lived a Bohemian lifestyle. Clara has her own secrets, seen taking some type of medicine for an unspecified issue. Isaac focuses on results from M dwarf stars, believing it to be a niche that no one else will bother with. When Clara finds a promising exoplanet, Isaac sneaks into the university in the night and lies to the telescope operators in Chile, claiming to have permission from his friend Charlie, to get more data on the planet. Charlie is furious, but also intrigued by the data results. He advises Isaac to contact Rebecca, Isaac's ex-wife, who holds an endowed chair at Caltech. Clara convinces Isaac to contact Rebecca, despite his reluctance. The upheaval in their lives is finally revealed, when Rebecca tells Isaac that finding life will not bring back their dead baby son. She gets him some time on the Keck telescope. This results in proving that they have found a habitable planet candidate. Clara is falling in love with Isaac, but he has become jaded about love or anything else that can not be scientifically proven. She kisses him, then abruptly backs off when he starts to respond. When Charlie's wife has a baby, Isaac pontificates on how a minuscule change took his own son, and could equally change the entire universe. Clara reminds him that those same minuscule changes did result in his son existing at all. This leads to them finally becoming a couple. When they learn that someone else discovered \\"their\\" planet a week before them, Isaac becomes despondent. He soon decides to focus on finding direct evidence of life, rather than just a potentially habitable planet. In his obsession, he is blind to Clara's declining health, until Charlie chastises him. Isaac tells Clara it is time for him to stop his search, but she makes him ignore the data and focus on his inner connection to the universe. He is surprised when it works, but rejects it and her. She grabs her bag to leave - and collapses. At the hospital, it is revealed that Clara has an autoimmune disease that is causing the complete breakdown of every organ and muscle in her body. The doctors are shocked that she can even walk or talk, and confirm she will soon be dead. Isaac stays at her bedside for her last few days. Moments before she dies, she tells him he is going to \\"see it\\". A fresh batch of TESS data is released, and Isaac does \\"see it\\" - proof of a seemingly artificial object in coincident orbit with an exoplanet. He takes his findings to Charlie, who introduces him to Dr. Rickman, head of the TESS project. Two years later, at a press conference at the JPL, Dr. Rickman, Rebecca and Charlie explain that the data gathered now conclusively proves the existence of the artificial object, orbiting a star 200 light years distant, in turn proving the existence of intelligent alien life. Isaac is not in his assigned seat on the panel, choosing instead to spend time reminiscing about Clara. A few months later, Rebecca summons Isaac to the SETI laboratory. She reveals that the aliens have sent a message--\\"Isaac Bruno\\". He is present when the next message arrives - an audio file of a Bob Dylan song that he and Clara often listened to together. The film ends with Isaac smiling through his tears.  Cast  * Patrick J. Adams as Dr. Isaac Bruno * Troian Bellisario as Clara * Ennis Esmer as Dr. Charlie Durant * Kristen Hager as Dr. Rebecca Jenkins * R. H. Thomson as Dr. Rickman * Jennifer Dale as Astrophysics Department Head  Themes  Victor Stiff summarizes Clara's main themes, which are \\"life's big questions\\": the nature of existence, human purpose, and \\"our need to connect with others.\\" The film asks us to consider the infinite, \\"but not before looking inward.\\" = \\"Are we alone?\\": existential longing = Clara is most simply described as a story about \\"space and love\\": space, in the sense of \\"this search for life among the stars\\" (the title itself was chosen because it means \\"clear\\" and \\"bright,\\" like a star), and love as it relates to bereavement: \\"As I was writing this film, I went through a very personal loss. I lost my grandfather.\\" = \\"We are not alone\\": science and spirituality = Sherman approaches the idea of life beyond Earth from both a scientific perspective from \\"a place of spirituality\\" in thinking that \\"there might be something out there... we're not alone\\", and, in an interview, he references Neil deGrasse Tyson looking up at the sky and \\"feeling a type of connectivity that's almost spiritual.\\"  Genre  Sherman calls the film a \\"high concept\\" science fiction drama. He does not consider it a romance, but anticipated it would be marketed that way \\"because the lead actors are married in real life\\"; it is a love story to the extent that there is \\"a binding bond between two characters\\" who are \\"just two people connecting for a bit.\\" Jim Slotek disagrees: \\"Sherman's objections notwithstanding, Clara is a romance, albeit an interrupted one ‚Äî kind of what you'd get if you crossed Carl Sagan's Contact with Erich Segal's Love Story.\\"  Production  = Background = At age 18, Sherman competed in the CineCoup Film Accelerator at the Banff World Media Festival, where he won second place and attracted the attention of producer Ari Lantos. Lantos immediately recognized a \\"visionary talent he needed to support\\". Sherman studied at Ryerson University's film school for one year, where one day, at 19, he became determined to write a story, shutting himself in his dormitory room for seven hours. Troian Bellisario = Writing and development = Friends Sherman made at Ryerson worked with him on his debut, The Rocket List, \\"made on no budget ... on a four-day road trip with a camera,\\" as well as on Clara. Together with James Ewasiuk, a \\"close collaborator\\" who co-wrote The Rocket List with him, Sherman did four months of research on \\"the Kepler telescope and transits and things like that.\\" Two years after they had met in Banff, Sherman ran into Lantos while pitching the draft script to Serendipity Point Films, from whom he received an option agreement the next day. Patrick J. Adams Both leads also contributed ideas. Patrick Adams was involved with the project from an early stage, giving feedback to Sherman on his script, on character in particular, which the director began revising in earnest at age 20 and finished two years later. Troian Bellisario provided \\"a similar depth for her character,\\" and suggested a different ending for the film, a note which Sherman accepted: \\"I had a different ending in mind, which I don't want to share because it's not as good.\\" It was Bellisario who brought up quantum entanglement for one of the earlier drafts.  Characterization  The character Isaac in the film is dealing with a loss so deep that he is \\"giving up on the universe\\". Adams pushed Sherman to allow him and Belissario to explore that loss \\"to its limits\\": \\"Akash had done such a good job of setting the framework in the initial script I had read, but then the depths of how far these characters had gone and could go wasn't quite there yet... you've built this. Let's get in there and go deep. We discussed some of the ways and how deep that could go and how bad it could get.\\"  Realism and consultation with scientists  The project relied on three scientific advisors, Canadian astrophysicists John Moores and Doug Welch, at York and McMaster universities respectively, and Barth Netterfeld of the University of Toronto. Sherman and producer Ari Santos sent out an e-mail to Toronto-area physics and astronomy departments asking for help. Welch responded because there was so much \\"real science\\" in Sherman's script. During preproduction Welch spent time with Sherman, Adams, and Bellisario, explaining such concepts as the Fermi paradox and the Drake equation in relation to the mechanics of astronomical observing, and later also suggested some dialogue exchanges. According to Sherman, almost everything was vetted by the three consultants. \\"It's so vetted, in fact, that the climactic discovery in the movie... turned out to be an original idea\\", later published by the American Astronomical Society. = Financing = Clara was produced by Serendipity Point in association with London-based Distant Horizon, with the support of Telefilm Canada, the Ontario Media Development Corporation (Ontario Creates), the CBC, and Bell Media's TMN. = Filming = Principal photography took place in Toronto and surrounding areas during the month of March in 2017. Leads Adams and Bellisario were married a little earlier, and spent a large portion of their honeymoon working on the film.  Locations  Locations included Sherman's alma mater Ryerson and the Mississauga campus of the University of Toronto for several NASA scenes, because of their \\"spectacular buildings\\". There are also outdoor scenes shot near Sugar Beach, while a shot of the exterior of the McLaughlin Planetarium in Toronto was not included in the final cut of the theatrical release.  Visual effects and scientific accuracy  TESS with technicians, prior to its April 2018 launch The detection method and the specialized telescopes depicted in Clara are not fictional. The TESS space telescope is a 2018 upgrade of the Kepler Telescope which was used to discover over 4000 exoplanets in the decade since 2009. Sherman started his filmmaking career as a visual effects artist and film editor, and all such VFX shots in the film were made by him rather than by his cinematographer, sourced from NASA: shots of planets transiting a sun come from the Solar Dynamics Observatory; shots of nebulae come from the Hubble Space Telescope: \\"I really wanted to show space honestly and in a way that would look familiar to people working in the field.\\" = Music = Composer Jonathan Kawchuk wrote a \\"soft score\\", complementing musical selections by Bob Dylan. Kawchuk converted sounds from NASA's Voyager spacecraft into a synthesizer, sounds which were \\"baked into a lot of the tracks.\\"  Marketing and related works  Lantos said that Clara was aimed at teenagers and women in their twenties, and science fiction fans in general. The film's trailer was uploaded to YouTube on 3 August 2018. Sherman gave a talk in advance of the film's premiere on the science behind the film at the Astronomy On Tap event in Toronto on 17 August 2018. Isaac and Clara's use of publicly available data from NASA's TESS led to a \\"Clara- inspired academic paper\\" written by Welch and Moores and published in Research Notes of the American Astronomical Society. The article, titled \\"Simulating Transits at the L1 Point\\", shares credit with Sherman. Welch describes the relevant part of the film and the published paper: > Near the end, when the characters are going over graphs of a star's light > dimming from a transiting planet, there is a nice lump on the graph that > draws the eye‚Äîan object or artifact that becomes a very important plot > point. Well, John Moores and I had figured out how such an object would > appear in actual data, and that's part of what we ended up submitting as a > paper. During the time we were developing this there was someone else, the > astrophysicist Eric Gaidos, who also wrote a paper of a similar nature > showing that our description was correct.  Release  Clara premiered at the 2018 Toronto International Film Festival.\\"TIFF 2018: Rob Stewart, Denys Arcand, Jennifer Baichwal films among Canadian titles\\". Now, 1 August 2018. This was followed by a Canadian limited theatrical release. = Distribution = D Films was responsible for Clara's Canadian theatrical distribution, while the CBC holds the television broadcast rights, and TMN holds the pay TV rights. In February 2019, the United States film rights were acquired by Screen Media Films for a limited theatrical release in May, in a deal negotiated with SVP Worldwide Acquisitions. = Home media and streaming = Clara is available on DVD from Screen Media Video and Blu-ray. The film is available on video on demand platforms such as Amazon Prime.  Reception  = Critical response = Clara has an approval rating of 50% on Rotten Tomatoes, based on 24 reviews. On Metacritic, which uses a weighted score, the film has a score of 43 out of 100, based on six reviews. Writing for The Hollywood Reporter, Frank Scheck finds Clara dry and academic, slow moving, the dialogue full of platitudes, and feels there is no chemistry between the married leads. Assigning the film 2 stars at RogerEbert.com, Peter Sobczynski called the film \\"peculiar and largely unsatisfying\\" despite the ambitions displayed by Akash Sherman: \\"the result is a weird muddle that's both too silly to be taken seriously and too staid to completely go off the beaten path.\\" Toronto critic Norman Wilner, writing for Now, though conceding the film has its moments, feels that the story stops where it ought to have begun. Tara Thorne finds that Clara has \\"outsized ideas that dominate and weaken the film beneath it\\", lacking in humour but featuring too much \\"data talk\\", though it finally gains traction in the last twenty minutes, a \\"big reveal\\" that pays off but also sacrifices genuine emotions for \\"dutifully plotted emotional beats.\\" Having said all this, Thorne calls Sherman an \\"assured director who clearly has big plans.\\" Unlike Thorne, Don Shanahan finds the real life science as an \\"interwoven backdrop\\" provides a \\"narrative boon for the science fiction of Clara.\\" Its \\"sense of intelligence intertwines with the unpredictability found in the amorous reverberations of the human heart\\", a combination which makes for an \\"intimate and daring film experience\\", a \\"rare treat\\" to have \\"two narrative genres combined with smarts and affection.\\" Writing for Exclaim!, Alex Hudson finds the science more intriguing than what he calls the film's philosophical musings, but, despite its flaws, it works as a mood piece: \\"the colours are muted, the score is appropriately ethereal, and it effectively captures Isaac's depression as he searches for meaning in his broken life. It gets under the skin even when it doesn't stimulate the mind.\\" Assigning the film 3.5 stars, Victor Stiff complains of the \\"glaring imbalance between the male and female lead characters\\", though the actors themselves \\"play well off each other\\" and, despite those issues, the film \\"comes through with a rousing conclusion that speaks to a longing we all feel as humans.\\" Giving the film a B rating, Jim Slotek calls Clara a \\"solidly written\\" film with an impressive \\"level of sophistication in the storytelling\\", benefiting from NASA‚Äìprovided photos and effects \\"cannily\\" used to give it \\"the look of a much higher budgeted movie\\". Daniel Hart assigns the film 4.5 stars, calling it a \\"remarkable\\" and \\"thought-provoking\\" story with applaudable performances\\". = Scientific response = Doug Welch responded to Sherman's original script because \\"it captures the excitement of revealing other planets and the potential for even identifying life elsewhere during our lifetime... it was clear to me that Akash understood a lot of the field and how it worked. You see this in small details, too, like ... using remote observations with a telescope in Chile.\\" The film's trailer, due both to \\"lush\\" visual effects and such \\"teasing science-savvy plot points\\" attracted a lot of attention on social media from astronomers. = Accolades =  Award  *Austin Film Festival, 2018 ‚Ä¢ Jury Award for a Narrative Feature (Akash Sherman and James Ewasiuk)  Nominations  ;2018 *Directors Guild of Canada Discovery Award; shortlisted (1 of 4) *Vancouver Film Critics Circle One to Watch Award and Best Best Actress in a Canadian Film ;2019 *Golden Trailer Awards Best Foreign Poster  References   External links  * Official page on Facebook * Official trailer on YouTube * Category:2018 films Category:2018 science fiction films Category:Canadian films Category:Canadian science fiction films Category:Films about extraterrestrial life Category:Films shot in Toronto ","title":"Clara (film)"},{"id":"58054225","text":"Grand Forks station is an active train station in Grand Forks, North Dakota.

Sometime before 960, Ordulf, Earl of Devon, built a church under his invocation. Several other churches in Devon and Cornwall were also named after him as well as the village of Romansleigh.

She taught drawing in London schools, and her work documents extensive British and European travel. In 1902 she was elected a full member of the Bristol Academy.  Early life  Blanche Baker's father, William Baker, was born in Bristol in about 1820 and in 1840 married Mary Anne Crispin, whose mother was from Devon. They lived in Trenchard Street, in central Bristol. Initially he was a plasterer, then a builder.Ancestry.co.uk, Census 1841 and 1861.

The Baker family moved to Sneyd Park Villa in a wealthier part of Bristol.Local historian Chris Stephens in Bristol Nine Magazine (February and June 2018) gives the date of the move as 1859 and the full address as being Ivywell Road. Stephens says that Baker purchased some land following the break-up of the Sneyd Park Estate in 1855, and goes on to explain that Baker‚Äôs company went on to build the Montpelier and Clifton Downs stations ‚Äòin ‚Ä¶ Gothic revival style‚Äô. These suggestions are not fully referenced. This was a substantial property with ‚Äòlawns, gardens, a conservatory, stables and one and a half acres of land‚Äô plus an adjacent farm.Western Daily Press, 23 May 1885. On the date of the 1861 census Blanche Baker was not actually in residence at Sneyd Park Villa, although the census indicates that she is one of nine siblings. Her grandmother Betsy Crispin had lived with them for several years, and there were live-in servants. Following her general education, Blanche attended Bristol School of Art (established in 1853 as ‚ÄòBristol School of Practical Art‚Äô and later accommodated within the Bristol Academy for the Promotion of Fine Arts's grand building that had been opened in 1958. The School of Art would become the Royal West of England Academy Schools).‚ÄòOur History‚Äô, Royal West of England Academy website.

Meanwhile, in 1863, in the competitions that Bristol Rifle Club held annually in Sneyd Park, Blanche had taken second prize in the Ladies Rifle Match ‚Äì 100 yards, seven shots with Prussian needle rifles. ‚ÄòThese novelty, but interesting matches attracted, of course, a great gathering of both sexes.‚ÄôWestern Daily Press, 1 Aug. 1863. In 1865 Mary Baker, Blanche's mother, died at the age of 46. There were three girls under the age of 10 to be looked after, and presumably much of the running of the household now fell to Mary's older daughters Rosa, 23, Blanche, 20, and Kate, 16. The oldest boy, Herbert, 21, had followed his father into the building business.  Artistic success and a family crisis  The acceptance of a watercolour drawing, Greenfell Lane, Gloucester, by the Royal Academy in 1869 seems to have been a turning point for Blanche's artistic career.Titles of Baker‚Äôs works exhibited at the Royal Academy are taken from Algernon Graves, The Royal Academy of Arts: A Complete Dictionary of Contributors and Their Work from Its Foundation in 1769 to 1904, vol. 1: Abbayne to Carrington, (London: Henry Graves & Co. and George Bell & Sons, 1905) and Royal Academy of Arts, Royal Academy Exhibitors, 1905‚Äì1970: A Dictionary of Artists and Their Work in the Summer Exhibitions of the Royal Academy of Arts (Wakefield: EP Publishing, 1973).

The choice of watercolour as Blanche's preferred medium and of landscape as her preferred genre was common among ‚Äòlady artists‚Äô, but the Bristol Academy did have traditional links to ‚ÄòBristol School‚Äô landscape painters such as William Muller, Francis Danby, J. B. Pyne and John Syer ‚Äì active in the early nineteenth century ‚Äì whose Bristol Society of Artists it had incorporated.‚ÄòOur History‚Äô Royal West of England Academy website. In 1876 Blanche was elected an Associate of the Bristol Academy.Western Daily Press, 5 Feb. 1876. Around this time her father ‚Äòmade the acquaintance of the wife of the Rev. Mr Wilkinson, on the death of whom he conceived the idea of marrying the widow, and communicated this fact to his family, who however were greatly opposed to the match.‚Äô Nevertheless, the marriage to Mrs Gertrude Blanche Wilkinson, age 44, went ahead in April 1877.Ancestry.co.uk, Parish registers 1720‚Äì1933. The extent to which the changed circumstances at Sneyd Park Villa may have prompted Blanche to move from Bristol is not known, but a brief item in the Western Daily Press of 17 January 1878 noted that ‚ÄòMiss Blanche Baker has retired from the committee of the Boys‚Äô Home in consequence of having left Bristol.‚Äô The second marriage of William Baker proved even more calamitous than the family had feared. Mrs Gertrude Blanche Baker, in her mid-forties, was an ‚Äòexceedingly improper person, for she was addicted to drink‚Äô. She behaved in an ‚Äòunbecoming and indecent way‚Äô, committing adultery with the Sneyd Park Villa coachman (Wheeler) and the carpenter (Owen). Newspaper accounts from 1880 explain that her behaviour brought about ‚Äòinsanity‚Äô and the necessity for William to be ‚Äòremoved to a lunatic asylum‚Äô. The Baker siblings took the unusual, but understandable, step of forming a committee and filing for divorce on behalf of their father, who was deemed incapable of representing himself. With adultery having been proved, a decree nisi was issued in July 1880 and a final decree in March 1881.Baker (by his committee) v. Baker, Wheeler & Owen in the High Court of Justice (Divorce), Court Minutes. The family now had the possibility of holding on to some of William's assets. Although Blanche was said to have left Bristol in 1878, at the time of the 1881 census she was living with her sister Laura on the farm adjacent to Sneyd Park Villa.Ancestry.co.uk, Census 1881. However, a few years later she had moved to the outskirts of London ‚Äì to Spring Cottage, Hanwell, Ealing, near where her father was living in a small private asylum, Wyke House, in Isleworth. William Baker probate summary and Historic Hospitals website.  Teaching  Blanche had apparently left Bristol to teach art in a London school, partly inspired by a collection of essays on education by the philosopher and social theorist Herbert Spencer.Herbert Spencer, Education: Intellectual, Moral, and Physical (London: Williams & Norgate, 1861). The article ‚ÄòSpencer on Education‚Äô at the Online Library of Liberty gives a full account of his educational theories. By coincidence, her sisters Rosa and Mabel Baker would be managing house for Spencer in the late 1880s and ‚Äòwe told him how the reading of this book [Education] by [Blanche] had induced her to take the post of art mistress in a London school, and had led to our leaving the country to join her in town.‚Äô‚ÄòTwo‚Äô [Rosa and Mabel Baker], Home Life with Herbert Spencer (Bristol: J. W. Arrowsmith, 1906, reprinted 1910), p. 106. It may have been Spencer's ideas on what was later termed a ‚Äòchild-centred‚Äô approach to education that resonated with Blanche. The earlier reference to her serving on the committee of a boys‚Äô homeWestern Daily Press, 17 Jan. 1878. seems to suggest social concern on her part and an awareness of the lack of opportunities for underprivileged children at this time before education had become nationally compulsory.  Becoming established  The Dutch House, Bristol exhibited in Bristol in 1885 Blanche's strength of personality and independence are further evidenced in an 1884 classified advertisement in The Times: ‚ÄòSketching Tours ‚Äì Miss Blanche Baker, an exhibitor at the Royal Academy, will give LESSONS to ladies travelling with her on the Thames during the months of July and August.‚ÄôThe Times, 16 July 1884. Assuming that this enterprise went ahead, it was interrupted by her father's death on 16 August 1884. Blanche and her elder brother, Herbert Baker ‚Äì who was now running their father's business at Canon's Marsh Steam Saw Mills ‚Äì were the two executors of the will.William Baker probate summary. When probate was finally settled later in the year, William Baker's personal estate was worth about ¬£5,311 (equivalent to about ¬£627,000 in 2017) with a resworn amount of ¬£14,938 in November 1884 (about ¬£1,690,000 in 2017). Sneyd Park Villa was advertised for sale in the following year.Western Daily Press, 23 May 1885. It is not known whether the sale went ahead, as in 1888 Blanche used the Sneyd Park Villa address in the Royal Academy catalogue. In early 1885 Blanche exhibited at a ‚ÄòLoan Exhibition of Women‚Äôs Industries‚Äô at Clifton, Bristol.Western Daily Press, 27 Feb. 1885. Later in 1885 she had 11 watercolours in the Winter Exhibition of the Bristol Academy, ‚Äòinclud[ing] transcripts of quaint buildings The Dutch House, Bristol; Clovelly and Mary-le-Port Street, Bristol‚Äô.Western Daily Press, 4 Dec. 1885. In 1887 she exhibited three watercolours ‚Äì Clovelly Pier, Clovelly and Bristol Streets ‚Äì with the Society of Lady Artists (SLA) in London. The Society's purpose was ‚Äòto gain acceptance for women artists by giving them the opportunity to exhibit their work. Membership was granted to women who had exhibited with the Society and who earned their livelihood through art.‚Äô The Society's name changed to the more assertive Society of Women Artists in 1899.Elizabeth Lomas, Guide to the Archive of Art and Design, Victoria & Albert Museum (London: Fitzroy Dearborn, 2001), p. 228. Cabbages and The Thames from Streatley were exhibited at the Royal Academy in 1888, and by the end of the year Blanche had moved back to Bristol, living at Leworthy Lodge, Stoke Bishop. In the Winter Exhibition of the Bristol Academy ‚ÄòA Weedy Pond affords a glimpse of a retired spot, where the quiet beauty of nature has been well observed, and, modest in its dimensions, it is a most successful study.‚ÄôWestern Daily Press, 4 Dec. 1888. In the following year The Thames and The Float, Bristol were exhibited in London with the SLA, and in 1890 Summer and November and Back of the Old Home (perhaps a view of Sneyd Park Villa) were shown at the Royal Academy. That was also the year of a joint exhibition with the landscape painter Edward Wilkins Waite at Messrs Frost and Reed in Queens Road, Bristol.Bristol Mercury, 4 Feb. 1890. In the census of 1891 Blanche, 47, gave her profession as ‚Äòartist ‚Äì landscape painting and teacher‚ÄôAncestry.co.uk, Census 1891.  Home Life with Herbert Spencer  One might assume that the settlement of William Baker's estate would have left the members of his family ‚Äòcomfortably well off‚Äô, so it is somewhat surprising that Blanche's sisters Rosa and Mabel Baker (writing in 1906) reflected on 1889 as beginning as a year ‚Äòof gloom and sadness to us ‚Ä¶ Misfortunes had come to us, as they come to so many, unforeseen and unsuspected, none the less hard to bear because they were not the first we had experienced.‚Äô They make it clear that a significant aspect of their distress was through ‚Äòmoney losses‚Äô.‚ÄòTwo‚Äô [Rosa and Mabel Baker], Home Life with Herbert Spencer (Bristol: J. W. Arrowsmith, 1906, reprinted 1910), p. 11. In 1889 Herbert Spencer, now 69 and a controversial and much celebrated public figure, had grown tired of staying in lodging houses. ‚ÄòI have taken a house in St. John‚Äôs Wood and am going to have three maiden ladies to take care of me!‚Äô he wrote to a friend.Letter to John Tyndall, 12 June 1889, quoted in David Duncan, The Life and Letters of Herbert Spencer (London: Methuen, 1908), p. 289. These ‚Äòmaiden ladies‚Äô were initially Rosa and Mabel Baker ‚Äì Blanche's older sister and a younger sister, although the reference to ‚Äòthree maiden ladies‚Äô indicates that from the outset Blanche was to be part of the ‚Äòarrangement‚Äô, brought about by a mutual friend, and by the time of the following year's Royal Academy Summer Exhibition she too was living at 64 Avenue Road, NW.The house at this address where Spencer lived with the Baker sisters was apparently demolished in 1939 (E. S. P. Haynes, 'Herbert Spencer's House' (letter), The Spectator, 3 Feb. 1939, p. 22). Some years after Spencer had died, Rosa and Mabel Baker ‚Äì using the pseudonym ‚ÄòTwo‚ÄôThey identified themselves as the authors in a letter to Alfred Russel Wallace, dated 13 January 1911 ‚Äì WCP6179.7155 in G.

W. Arrowsmith, 1906, reprinted 1910). This is a warm portrait of Spencer, and also gives an insight into the relationship between the sisters: > [Blanche] had not seen us since our instalment in Avenue Road, and she was > evidently surprised at the unexpected subjects that had already begun to > interest as. We were talking of something we had just read in one of Mr. > Spencer‚Äôs books, and quite innocently used one or two long words not > formerly in our vocabulary.

W. Arrowsmith, 1906, > reprinted 1910), pp. 87‚Äì8. Blanche's move to London saw her broadening her exhibition base: in 1893 The Only Customers and A Deserted Farmhouse were exhibited at the Royal Hibernian Academy of Arts in Dublin. In 1895 she exhibited A Cornish Roadside at a loan exhibition in Hampstead,Hampstead and High Express, 2 Feb. 1895. and, maintaining her links with her home town, at Bristol Academy she showed ‚Äòa little picture ‚Ä¶ a sketch of a thatched homestead and meadows. It is called The Home Fields and it is carefully worked, almost too careful; but very sunny and full of light.‚ÄôWestern Daily Press, 29 April 1895. Blanche was elected an Associate of the Society of Lady Artists in 1895, and there was a further Bristol exhibition in 1896: ‚ÄòAn attractive collection of watercolour drawings by Miss Blanche Baker, a Bristol lady, is on view at Messrs Frost and Reed Gallery, 47 Queens Road.‚ÄôBristol Mercury, 3 Oct. 1896. Around 1894 Spencer, who was spending an increasing amount of time away from London, gave warning that he was planning to terminate the arrangement at 64 Avenue Road, but wrote warmly, ‚ÄòThe remembrance of times spent with you and your sisters during 1889, ‚Äô90, ‚Äô91 and ‚Äô92 will always will always be pleasant to me.‚ÄôDavid Duncan, The Life and Letters of Herbert Spencer (London: Methuen, 1908), pp. 365‚Äì6. Despite this warning, however, Spencer did not act to evict the sisters until 1897, and by then he took a more negative view of their relationship. There were disagreements about expenses, and he complained that ‚Äòthe house is occupied by the [Baker] family, yourselves and relatives; and when I am home the social intercourse and the administration give the impression that 64, Avenue Road is the residence of the Misses [Baker] where Mr. Spencer resides when he is in town.‚ÄôLetter of 1 April 1897 quoted in David Duncan, The Life and Letters of Herbert Spencer (London: Methuen, 1908), p. 404.  European travel and a family home  At some point after the sisters left Avenue Road in 1897 they moved to the northern outskirts of London, to Sneed Cottage, an eight-room house in Totteridge Lane, Whetstone, near Barnet. The name may have been an example of the Bakers‚Äô self-deprecating humour ‚Äì ‚ÄòSneed‚Äô was the local Bristol pronunciation of ‚ÄòSneyd‚Äô. Having been brought up in the grander ‚ÄòSneyd Park Villa‚Äô of their youth, they now lived in Sneed Cottage. Towards the end of the century Blanche broadened the subjects of her work as she travelled to Europe ‚Äì France, Germany, Switzerland, northern Italy and Spain. Lake at Lucerne, for example, was exhibited with the Hampstead Art Society at the Conservatoire, Eton Avenue, in 1896. In 1899 Blanche had a significant exhibition of 42 watercolours at the Modern Gallery, 175 Bond Street. Like the 1890 exhibition at Bristol, it was a joint exhibition with Edward Wilkins Waite.Catalogue (1899) in National Art Library, London. Some of the titles suggest higher ambitions than her usual parochial subjects: ‚ÄòWhere skies make azure of our earth-born greys‚Äô commands her highest asking price, of 15 guineas, and ‚ÄòWhere cattle tread the soaking soil‚Äô is 10 guineas ‚Äì both prices a step up from the 8 or 9 guineas that are usually listed for her Royal Academy works. There were a number of views of Switzerland, including the dramatic alpine summit The Jungfrau. England was represented by works depicting Norfolk, Cambridgeshire, Guildford, Somerset and Yorkshire. Some titles ‚Äì such as Blackberry Gatherers and The Bean Gatherer ‚Äì suggest more of a human presence than was usual in her work. There were also four flower studies: Roses, Murillos, Tulips and Freesia.

She served between 1968 and 1986 as head of the Politburo office, which meant she was responsible for preparing the agendas and draft decisions, and for producing the minutes of Poliburo meetings.  Biography  Gisela Trautzsch was born in Lengefeld, a small town at the heart of the mining region south of Chemnitz. As the niece of the Communist activist Walter Trautzsch, she grew up in a highly politicised working-class family.Berliner Zeitung 30 October 1985 Her father was a metal worker. She attended school locally and then completed a \\"commercial\\" training at the vocational secondary school. After that she took a clerical job at the Kunstharzpresserei plant in Lengefeld. War ended in May 1945. A large central portion of Germany, including her home region, was now administered as the Soviet occupation zone. Membership of the Communist Party was no longer illegal, and despite not yet being 21, Gisela Trautzsch joined it. In April 1946 a contentious political merger resulted (if only, for most purposes, within the Soviet occupation zone) in the formation of a new political party, the Socialist Unity Party (\\"Sozialistische Einheitspartei Deutschlands\\" / SED), and she was one of thousands of Communist Party members happy to sign their party membership across to a new united party of the left which many believed would ensure avoidance of a return to one-party dictatorship. Between 1945 and 1948 Gisela Trautzsch was employed by the party leadership team for her local region of Marienberg (\\"KPD/SED -Kresileitung Marienberg\\") as a typist and as head of the personnel department. By 1948 she had also become secretary for Agitation and Propaganda with the Marienberg local party. During 1949/50 she undertook a study course (by correspondence course) with the Karl Marx Party Academy. That opened the way to a job in Berlin, where she was based by 1951. Later, between 1955 and 1960, she undertook a longer remote study course with the Karl Marx Party Academy which led to the award of a degree in Social Sciences in 1960. Between 1951 and 1968 shew was employed as a deputy head of the Politburo office. After the death of Otto Sch√∂n in September 1968, Gisela Glende succeeded him as head of the office. A few years later, in 1971, she herself became a member of the powerful Party Central Committee. She remained in post till September 1986 when she was degraded sideways and downwards in what was seen by commentators as an attempt by the leadership to try and rejuvenate the politburo and indeed the Central Committee more widely. Between 1986 and 1989 she served on the party's National Audit Commission (\\"Zentrale Revisionskommission\\").  Personal  Gisela Trautzsch married G√ºnter Glende (1918‚Äì2004) in 1973.

History  The plant was the first hydro-electric plant in South Africa and first power plant in Cape Town. It was the second electric power plant in South Africa. The city of Kimberly had power to light up its street lights in 1882. The Graaff Electrice Lighting Works power plant was commissioned by the Cape Town City Council in April 1895 after the completion of the Molteno Reservoir that was constructed to help supply potable water to the rapidly growing city. The plant was named after David de Villers-Graaff who was mayor of Cape Town from 1891-1892 and personally funded the construction of the power plant. Costing ¬£75,000 in 1895, equivalent to ¬£8,209,000 (around ZAR143 million) in 2017. Graaff was a big proponent of the then relatively new technology of electricity, especially for public lighting. Demand for electricity was driven by the need for street lights to help reduce crime in the city. The plant had two 150 kw generators which could be driven either by steam or water power. Water to power the generators was supplied from the Woodhead Reservoir on Table Mountain. For the twelve months before 30 June 1896 the plant ran for 2590 hours on water power and for 691 hours on coal fired steam power. The plant powered 775 public street lights throughout the city of Cape Town. The plant was decommissioned in 1920 and declared a national monument in 1993.  Current status  The old power plant building in 2012 as seen from its southern side. The power plant building still stands at the west of the Molteno Dam and is a registered national monument. In 2015 plans were announced to renovate the building so as to house a ‚ÄúMuseum for ‚Äòwater heritage‚Äô‚Äù. However officials also stated that since the site sits close to the reservoir it is unlikely that the site will ever be open to the public due to security concerns.

Life and martyrdom  Tracki was born in Bleischwitz, German Empire (now Poland) on 2 December 1896. The son of Josef Tracki and his wife Martha, n√©e Schramm, Alfons grew up in a village in Upper Silesia. When he attended school, he had contact with the Christian School Brothers. He requested to be admitted to the community at their provincial school in Vienna at age 14. He was accepted, and after a novitiate of two years became a member on 16 August 1913, with the religious name Gebhard. He was sent to Albania before World War I and taught at the Xaverian College in Shkod√´r. With the outbreak of the war, he returned to his home village. He served in the military for two years. He also completed his vows during the war. After the war, he returned to Shkod√´r, where he studied philosophy and theology. He was ordained as a priest on 14 June 1925 by Laz√´r Mjeda, the archbishop there. He exercised his ministry in Northern Albania, teaching in the schools and organizing sports for the youth. Tracki became chaplain at the St Stephen's Cathedral in Shkod√´r. He founded a Catholic youth organisation, Viribus unitis (\\"With joined powers\\"). After his time as chaplain, he became the parish priest of Velipoja. Tracki is remembered, in Zef Pllumi's memoirs Live to tell, as a good priest and crucial in the upbringing of other priests, such as would-be martyr . Further, he was heavily involved in the eradication of the Gjakmarrja (Northern Albanian blood feuds), by offering a Christian solution of peace to them. Communist partisans under Enver Hoxha fought against the Italian and German occupying forces. After the Albanian Communist Party came to power, conspirators with the former rulers were prosecuted, which included Catholics in general. Pjet√´r Arbnori wrote that Tracki joined a group of anti- communist Freisch√§rler in the mountains. When Tracki administered the Extreme Unction to a fatally wounded soldier, he was arrested. He was in a prison in Shkod√´r from 13 February 1946, and was sentenced to death on 17 July for performing an illegal priestly act. He was executed on 18 July 1946. According to witnesses, his last words were: \\"... I do not regret dying, as long as I'm dying together with my brothers, and I have contributed, as much as they have, for your own good, and for the religion of Christ.\\" Beatified on 5 November 2016 with the other martyrs of Albania, Tracki is venerated as a martyr by the Catholic Church and commemorated with the other martyrs of Albania on 18 July, the date of his execution.

It often involves breaking down and examining the distinctive patterns and characteristics of the programming code and then comparing them to computer code whose authorship is known. Unlike software forensics, code stylometry attributes authorship for purposes other than intellectual property infringement, including plagiarism detection, copyright investigation, and authorship verification.  History  In 1989, researchers Paul Oman and Curtis Cook identified the authorship of 18 different Pascal programs written by six authors by using ‚Äúmarkers‚Äù based on typographic characteristics. In 1998, researchers Stephen MacDonell, Andrew Gray, and Philip Sallis developed a dictionary-based author attribution system called IDENTIFIED (Integrated Dictionary-based Extraction of Non-language- dependent Token Information for Forensic Identification, Examination, and Discrimination) that determined the authorship of source code in computer programs written in C++. The researchers noted that authorship can be identified using degrees if flexibility in the writing style of the source code, such as: * The way the algorithm in the source code solves the given problem * The way the source code is laid out (spacing, indentation, bordering characteristics, standard headings, etc.) * The way the algorithm is implemented in the source code The IDENTIFIED system attributed authorship by first merging all the relevant files to produce a single source code file and then subjecting it to a metrics analysis by counting the number of occurrences for each metric. In addition, the system was language-independent due to its ability to create new dictionary files and meta-dictionaries. In 1999, a team of researchers led by Stephen MacDonell tested the performance of three different program authorship discrimination techniques on 351 programs written in C++ by 7 different authors. The researchers compared the effectiveness of using a feed-forward neural network (FFNN) that was trained on a back- propagation algorithm, multiple discriminant analysis (MDA), and case-based reasoning (CBR). At the end of the experiment, both the neural network and the MDA had an accuracy rate of 81.1%, while the CBR reached an accuracy performance of 88.0%. In 2005, researchers from the Laboratory of Information and Communication Systems Security at Aegean University introduced a language- independent method of program authorship attribution where they used byte- level n-grams to classify a program to an author. This technique scanned the files and then created a table of different n-grams found in the source code and the number of times they appear. In addition, the system could operate with limited numbers of training examples from each author. However, the more source code programs that were present for each author, the more reliable the author attribution. In an experiment testing their approach, the researchers found that classification using n-grams reached an accuracy rate of up to 100%, although the rate declined drastically if the profile size exceeded 500 and the n-gram size was 3 or less. In 2011, researchers from the University of Wisconsin created a program authorship attribution system that identified a programmer based on the binary code of a program instead of the source code. The researchers utilized machine learning and training code to determine which characteristics of the code would be helpful in describing the programming style. In an experiment testing the approach on a set of programs written by 10 different authors, the system achieved an accuracy rate of 81%. When tested using a set of programs written by almost 200 different authors, the system performed with an accuracy rate of 51%. In 2015, a team of postdoctoral researchers from Princeton University, Drexel University, the University of Maryland, and the University of Goettingen as well as researchers from the U.S. Army Research Laboratory developed a program authorship attribution system that could determine the author of a program from a sample pool with programs written by 1,600 coders with a 94 percent accuracy. The methodology consisted of four steps: # Disassembly - The program is disassembled to obtain information on its characteristics. # Decompilation - The program is converted into a variant of C-like pseudocode through decompilation to obtain abstract syntax trees. # Dimensionality reduction - The most relevant and useful features for author identification are selected. # Classification - A random- forest classifier attributes the authorship of the program. This approach analyzed various characteristics of the code, such as blank space, the use of tabs and spaces, and the names of variables, and then used a method of evaluation called a syntax tree analysis that translated the sample code into tree-like diagrams that displayed the structural decisions involved in writing the code. The design of these diagrams prioritized the order of the commands and the depths of the functions that were nestled in the code.  The 2014 Sony Pictures hacking attack  U.S. intelligence officials were able to determine that the 2014 cyber attack on Sony Pictures was sponsored by North Korea after evaluating the software, techniques, and network sources. The attribution was made after cybersecurity experts noticed similarities between the code used in the attack and a malicious software known as Shamoon, which was used in the 2013 attacks against South Korean banks and broadcasting companies by North Korea.

The episode was written and storyboarded by Tom Herpich and Bert Youn, from a story by Mark Banker, Kent Osborne, Patrick McHale, and series creator Pendleton Ward. It originally aired on Cartoon Network on August 1, 2011 and guest stars Ron Lynch as Mr. Pig. The series follows the adventures of Finn (voiced by Jeremy Shada), a human boy, and his best friend and adoptive brother Jake (voiced by John DiMaggio), a dog with magical powers to change shape and grow and shrink at will. In this episode, the apples of Tree Trunks (voiced by Polly Lou Livingston) are stolen, Finn and Jake dive into the slums of the Candy Kingdom to find the thief. Plot Finn (voiced by Jeremy Shada) and Jake (voiced by John DiMaggio) arrive at the house of Tree Trunk (voiced by Polly Lou Livingston) to discover that all of her apples have been stolen. They resolve to help her track down the thieves, bring them to justice, and return her stolen fruit. Finn and Jake go to the candy tavern, and after convincing the bartender that they are rogues, are given the location of a gang who trade apples. However, Finn and Jake soon learn that \\"apples\\" is street-slang for \\"diamonds\\", which this gang is actually trading. The gang catches Finn and Jake, and the two are very nearly eaten by a reluctant pig (voiced by Ron Lynch) that the criminals use to dispose of their enemies, but they manage to escape with Mr. Pig in tow. Back at Tree Trunks's house, Mr. Pig claims that he can \\"hear\\" apples somewhere in the building. Aftering opening up a closet, dozens of apples spill out, causing Tree Trunks to think that she is the thief. Finn, however, soon deduces that a family of magpiles stole all her apples and inadvertently stored them in the closet. Production \\"Apple Thief\\" was written and storyboarded by Tom Herpich and Bert Youn from a story developed by Mark Banker, Patrick McHale, Kent Osborne, and series creator Pendleton Ward. During the production of \\"Apple Thief\\", Youn was living in South Korea undergoing mandatory army training with the South Korean military, whereas Herpich was living in Los Angeles. Unlike how Youn and Jesse Moynihan heavily communicated with one another via the Internet when they worked on the previous third-season episode \\"Hitman\\", Youn and Herpich mostly kept to themselves, as they each trusted the other to remain faithful to the episode's outline. One of the lines dialogue in this episode, written by Herpich, features Tree Trunks referring to a character as looking like an army brat. Herpich did not really understand what he meant when he wrote it, but he felt it was inherently funny and \\"trusted his gut\\"; Herpich later explained that he was challenging himself to write the weirdest dialogue he could think of, and then to see where the results would lead him. Ward, confused by the line, wanted to cut it, but Herpich argued that it was funny. After a test screening of the line provided a large laugh, Ward agreed to include the line. The opening scene of \\"Apple Thief\\" features Jake preparing several Korean dishes, such as bibimbap. The opening scene, which features Jake preparing a number of Korean dishes, was Ward's idea, inspired by Youn's love of cooking Korean cuisine. Originally, when the animation for the episode was sent back to California, all of the trees in Tree Trunks' orchard had apples on them. These in turn had to be painted out one by one by art director Nick Jennings to maintain consistency with the episode's storyline. Many of the gang members were brought back as gender-bent versions of themselves in the fifth-season episode \\"Bad Little Boy\\". This was because Rebecca Sugar, co-storyboarder for said episode, felt that they fit in with the \\"rough\\" nature of Lumpy Space Prince's party. The voice for the banana guards was inspired by a time Ward imitated John DiMaggio's voice for Jake. Tom Kenny overheard this attempt and, thinking it humorous, parroted it back at Ward. Ward, in turn, enjoyed Kenny's rendition so much that it became the standard voice for the guard. Ron Lynch voiced both the large Gingerbread henchman and Mr. Pig. After the completion of this episode, Ward wanted Mr. Pig to come back because he felt that both the character and Lynch's voice acting were funny. The design for Mr. Pig was settled upon late in the production of the episode. According to Youn, he and Herpich simply each drew a very rudimentary pig design, since neither could easily agree with the other, due to their aforementioned communication issues.. Reception \\"Apple Thief\\" first aired on Cartoon Network on October 3, 2011. The episode was viewed by 2 million viewers and scored a 0.3 Nielsen rating in the 18- to 49-year-old demographic. Nielsen ratings are audience measurement systems that determine the audience size and composition of television programming in the United States, which means that the episode was seen by 0.3 percent of all households aged 18 to 49 years old were watching television at the time of the episode's airing. The episode first saw physical release as part of the complete third season DVD on February 25, 2014. It was later re-released as part of the DVD complication set Frost & Fire on March 3, 2015.

Description The female of T. stylifera ranges in length from about , and the male is generally between about in length. Distribution T. stylifera is primarily found in the Atlantic, off of the coasts of Central America, northern South America, western Europe, and northern Africa. It can also be found in large numbers in the Mediterranean Sea and Red Sea. Ecology =Life cycle and reproduction= Although T. stylifera is a continuous breeder, it experiences seasonal fluctuations in egg production rate. During one study in the Gulf of Naples, maximum egg production rates were found to occur from about February to July, with minimum rates found between about August and mid-October. In an earlier study, however, maximum egg production was found in late summer, with a period of minimal reproduction occurring in winter. Females can only go about three or four days before needing to remate to continue to produce fertile eggs. The eggs hatch about 88% of the time, with a decrease in success from September to October, and stage I nauplii survive to stage II about 12% of the time. All stages of T. stylifera (from stage I nauplii to adults) are most abundant in the Gulf of Naples from August to October. During this time, stage I through III nauplii are mainly concentrated in the top of depth (although they range to ), and the older nauplii are mainly concentrated in the closest to the surface (but they can be found deeper than this). Copepodite stages I through IV are generally more abundant than stage V copepodites. Stage I through III copepodites are usually found in the top of the water column, with the distribution of older stages being variable. At some stations, older copepodites are generally found in the top , whereas at some stations, the distributions may be deeper in the season of highest abundance.

Ernest Hale, was a Unitarian minister in South Australia. History Hale was born in Geelong, Victoria, a son of William Henry Hale and Martha Jane Hale He was a student at the Baptist College 1905‚Äì1906 Hale graduated BA from the University of Melbourne, after a career described as brilliant, and served as minister of the Baptist Church at Murrumbeena, Victoria 1910‚Äì1914. He was invited to serve as temporary minister of the Unitarian Free Church at Wellington, New Zealand in 1914, and remained there for six years, then accepted a call to the Unitarian Christian Church, Wakefield Street, Adelaide to succeed the Rev. Wyndham Heathcote. Hale preached his sermons at the Adelaide church at 11 am and 7 pm on or before 20 February 1921. He conducted his last service in Adelaide on 30 December 1945. Hale was noted for his sermons: thoughtful, original, well-prepared and delivered without notes of any kind. He was praised for his oratorical skills: clear perfect diction and a pleasant voice, slow and deliberate (an asset in such a large space with no acoustic treatment) and rising in pitch for emphasis. His sermons would have been taxing for the uneducated but deeply satisfying for the academically inclined, as he assumed some knowledge of History, Mythology, Psychology and Classical languages from his audience, but withal punctuated by a lively sense of humour. The subjects of his Sunday sermons were always clearly defined and often topical, and posted on a large notice board in front of the church early in the week. Hale opposed participation in the war of 1938‚Äì1945. Pacifism was not a tenet of the Unitarian denomination, and many men from the Wakefield Street church were posted overseas, more than a few losing their lives. His sermon of Sunday evening 8 October 1939 This or Any Other War: Where I Stand and Why must have ruffled a few feathers: > [. . . closing paragraphs:] This then is where I stand and why. I know how > fateful is my decision. It is quite possible that by some I shall be judged > a fool, by others a knave. I may fall very far short of my ideal, but at > least I shall try. I shall seek to love everybody and remember that a man in > uniform may be as true to his light as I am to mine. Nevertheless on I must > go. > If any listening to me are disposed to make a similar stand, let them pause > and consider the cost. I think it will be very high. The deliberate > downright pacifists will, along with the soldier, have much to suffer, but > he will be sustained with the thought that, as God lives and the way of > Christ is the way where the light dwelleth, his witness is grandly worth > whileG.

Other activities *He gave public speaking classes at the Workers' Educational Association from 1923 and from 1928 gave regular Saturday afternoon talks on Adelaide radio 5CL from 1928 to . The subject of his talks could be education, personal development, literature, folklore, history, psychology and topics of the day, in all of which he had an abiding interest. Despite (or because of) his avoidance of religiosity, he attracted a great number of visitors, particularly young adults, to the church, which was sometimes full to overflowing. *He served as Chairman of the All Nations' Chum Movement executive. *He ran a well-attended Bible class, which was held at 4.30 every Sunday afternoon, at which a member would present a paper, whose contents formed the basis of subsequent discussion. *He founded the Optimists' Group as a social club, reading plays, planning events and general discussion, and also helping the church in small ways: fundraising and property maintenance. Each year they hosted a banquet for Church Members. *He founded an Expression Class which produced dramatic performances (and with the incumbency of his successor Rev.

Ice Breakers began showing growth following the acquisition by Hershey. In 2006, it was reported that Hershey had the third largest share of the chewing-gum market and it viewed Ice Breakers as a means of expanding its share. As of 2014, it was reported that overall chewing-gum sales were in decline. It was thought by some economy experts to be due to the economy at the time and a larger variety of choices outside of chewing gum. In 2016, it was reported that Ice Breaker's sales of its Ice Cubes product had increased from 2015.  Products and promotions  Ice Breakers manufactures and sells mint and chewing gum products including, cool mints, peppermint chews and soft, cube-shaped gum that it has branded as Ice Cubes. In 2003, Ice Breakers launched Liquid Ice, a liquid filled mint. An advertising and PR campaign that centered around Jessica Simpson was also launched to promote the product. In 2004, the company released its dual-pack gum and mints. Later that year, Ice Breakers signed Hilary and Haylie Duff as the brand's spokeswomen.

On 4 October the filly was moved up sharply in class to contest the Group 1 Prix Marcel Boussac over 1600 metres at Longchamp and finished strongly to take third place behind Ballydoyle and Turret Rocks. =2016: three-year-old season= In the Group 3 Prix de la Grotte over 1600 metres at Chantilly Racecourse on 20 April, Qemah started the 4/1 third choice in the betting behind Trixia (winner of the Prix des R√©servoirs) and Antonoe. After racing in mid-division she accelerated into the lead 200 metres out and won \\"comfortably\\" by two and a half lengths from Kenriya. Qemah started favourite in the Poule d'Essai des Pouliches at Deauville on 15 May but after stumbling early in the race she came home third behind La Cressonniere and Nathra. On 17 June the filly was sent to England for the Coronation Stakes over one mile at Royal Ascot and started at odds of 6/1 in a thirteen-runner field. Jet Setting started favourite, while the other runners included Alice Springs, Nathra, Nemoralia (Michael Seely Memorial Stakes), Besharah (Lowther Stakes), Fireglow (Montrose Stakes) and Now Or Later (Derrinstown Stud 1,000 Guineas Trial). After being restrained by Benoist in the early stages, she began to make rapid progress on the outside in the straight, took the lead just inside the final furlong, and won by one and three quarter lengths and a short head from Nemoralia and Alice Springs. Qemah was matched against older fillies and mares in the Prix Rothschild over 1600 metres at Deauville on 31 July and started second favourite behind Alice Springs who had won the Falmouth Stakes since her defeat at Ascot. The other eight runners included Esoterique, Amazing Maria and Lumiere. Qemah settled in mid-division, went to the front 300 metres from the finish and kept on well to win by one and a quarter lengths from Volta. On 10 September the filly attempted to win her third consecutive Group 1 race when she was sent to Ireland for the Matron Stakes at Leopardstown Racecourse but was beaten into third behind Alice Springs and Persuasive. In the 2016 World's Best Racehorse Rankings Qemah was given a rating of 116, making her the 158th best racehorse in the world. =2017: four-year-old season= Qemah began her second season in the Chartwell Fillies' Stakes at Lingfield Park in May in which she started favourite but finished second to Mix and Mingle after being hampered two furlongs out. On 21 June she returned to Royal Ascot for the Group 2 Duke of Cambridge and was made the 5/2 favourite ahead of thirteen opponents including Usherette (winner of the race in 2016), Mix and Mingle, Turret Rocks, Smart Call (from South Africa) and Greta G (from Argentina). Racing up the stands- side of the course (the left-hand side from the jockeys' viewpoint) she took the lead approaching the final furlong and was \\"driven out\\" by Benoist to win by three quarters of a length from the 40/1 outsider Aljazzi with Usherette a neck away in third. On 30 July Qemah started favourite as she attempted to repeat her 2016 success in the Prix Rothschild, but finished fourth in a \\"blanket finish\\", beaten half a length by the winner Roly Poly. At Leopardstown in September she came home fifth in a strongly-contested edition of the Matron Stakes behind Hydrangea, Winter, Persuasive and Wuheida, with Roly Poly, Rhododendron and Intricately finishing behind. On her final racecourse appearance she finished sixth of the thirteen runners behind Roly Poly in the Sun Chariot Stakes at Newmarket Racecourse on 7 October.

He was chief technical officer of the Danish Sugar Factories from 1872 to 1897 and then served as chairman of the board until 1916. He owned several sugar plantations on Saint Croix in the Danish West Indies. Early life and education Hagemann was born on the Rodsteenseje estate at Odder in 1842, the son of Otto Waldemar Hagemann (1809‚Äì90) and Sophie Marie Poulsen (1815‚Äì1901). His father owned the estate until 1857 when he returned to Holstein. Hagemann went to school in Aarhus before studying Applied Sciences at the College of Advanced Technology in Copenhagen from 1860 to 1865. Career Hagemann was in 1864 employed by kryolitfabrikken √òresund. In 1865, when he had completed his exams, Kryolit Mine og Handelsselskabet sent him to the US to oversee the deliveries of cryolite to the Pennsylvania Salt Manufacturing Company. In early 1856, he travelled to the US to provide technical support in connection with the first deliveries of cryolite from Greenland. With inspiration from David Alter's nearby production site, Hagemann began to work on improving methods to manufacture and purify bromine from salt well. He obtained several patents and in the spring of 1868 established his first plant in Pomeroy, Ohio. During a visit to Europe in the summer of 1869, C. F. Tietgen convinced Hagemann to purchase kryolitfabrikken √òresund in a partnership with Vilhelm J√∏rgensen (1844‚Äì1925). Hagemann then sold his bromine manufacturing activities in the US and settled permanently in Denmark. Hagemann and Vilhelm J√∏rgensen also constructed Hinnerup Natroncellulosefabrik for count Mogens Frijs and operated it on a ten-year lease. They also established Drakulla Cellulosefabrik in Sm√•land, Sweden. Jahemann painted by Niels Vinding Dorph When De Danske Sukkerfabrikker was founded in 1872, Tietgen selected Hagemann for the position as chief chemist (overkemiker) in the new company. Hagemann oversaw the construction of the company's first manufacturing site, Sukkerkogeriet Odense, in Odense, which began operations in 1873‚Äì74. He was then sent to the Danish West Indies to reorganize the sugar cane industry. St. Croix F√¶llessukkerkogeri started operations in 187and the last technical challenges were solved when Hagemann visited St. Croiz for the third time in 1879. Hagemann, who was appointed to chief technical officer in 1882, was also responsible for planning the new sugar manufacturing plants in Nakskov (1881), Assens (1883) and Stege (1883). In 1894, Hagemann purchased the sugar plantation La Grange on Saint Croix and immediately began to modernize its operations. He also acquired the sugar plantations Prosperity, Williams, Wheel of Fortune and Punch. Hagemann retired from the position as chief technical officer of De Danske Sukkerfabrikker in 1897 but then served as chairman of the company from 1898 until his death. Hagemann had also joined the board of Burmeister & Wain in 1893 and became its chairman in 1898. The company was then reorganized and outdated machinery was modernized. He was also involved in the establishment of the first Danish steel works and introduced a new focus on diesel engines. Other pursuits G.A. Hagemanns Kollegium in Copenhagen Hagemann was a member of a number of important boards and commissions. He was a co-founder of the Danish Association of Engineers and served as its president from 1895‚Äì98. He was president of the Danish College of Advanced Technology from 1902 to 1912. He was also a member of Copenhagen City Council in 1882‚Äì1902. He supported Niels Finsen economically and contributed to the fight against tuberculosis. He founded G.A. Hagemanns Kollegium and created a number of associated grants for students in 1928. It was the first dormitory in Copenhagen that was open to both male and female residents. Personal life Hagemann married Mathilde Bruun (27 September 1846 ‚Äì 16 January 1931) in Assens. She was the daughter of local merchant, savings bank manager and debuty consul Bertel Brun (1820‚Äì94) and Margrethe Sophie Frederikke Brin n√©e Brasch (1825‚Äì93). Hagemann purchased Borupg√•rd at Snekkersten in 1899. In 1911 he also acquired Bergsj√∂holm in Scania. He died at Borupg√•rd on 26 April 1916 and is buried at Vestre Cemetery in Copenhagen. He left three children. The elder of the two sons, Gunnar Aage Hagemann (1877‚Äì1971), was a medical doctor. He inherited Bergsj√∂holm from his father and was also the owner of S√∏b√¶kgaard in Esperg√¶rde, Ristrup in Jutland (1908‚Äì1916) and Ruuthsbo in Scania. His daughter, Antonie Sophie Hagemann (1879‚Äì1054), married the physician and chemist Karl Albert Hasselbalch. They owned Borupg√•rd.

Buffalo was built in Philadelphia, Pennsylvania, under the supervision of naval constructor Charles Penrose. Buffalo conducted her sea trials on 29 May 1813 and was commissioned soon thereafter, with Lt. Samuel Angus in command. Name Buffalo was named for the American Bison, commonly referred to as buffalo, not the city of Buffalo on Lake Erie in western New York as later ships of her name were. History Constructed for service with the Delaware Flotilla, a unit that Lt. Angus also commanded, Buffalo, which resembled a vessel loaded with shingles, saw her only action just weeks after commissioning. The morning of 29 July 1813 found the Delaware Flotilla lying off Dennis Creek, when Lt. Angus discovered that the British 18-gun sloop-of-war HMS Martin aground on the outer ridge of Crow's Shoals after chasing and capturing a small vessel too near the Overfalls. Angus, thinking it \\"proper to endeavor to bring him [Martin] to action,\\" ordered the flotilla, consisting of the block sloops USS Buffalo and USS Camel and eight gunboats, to weigh anchor and stand toward the enemy. As the American ships did so, however, the British 38-gun frigate HMS Junon anchored to support Martin. The Americans, despite being plagued by poor gunpowder, delivered a brisk cannonade of the grounded sloop but did so from too great a distance. Likewise, while most of the enemy's shot missed Angus' ships, one passed through the foot of Buffalo's jib and another through the under part of her bowsprit. Only one other American ship, Gunboat No. 125, suffered any damage in the inconclusive, long-range engagement, although Gunboat No. 121 was captured after straying from the formation in disobedience to Angus' orders. The court of inquiry that met on board Buffalo on 11 September 1813 found Angus guilty of an error in judgement but not of any lack of personal bravery. He had shown ample courage at other times in his career, both in the Quasi-War with France and in the War of 1812. The court felt that he might have moved his command closer to the grounded Martin which then might have been at the flotilla's mercy, given her condition. Buffalo presumably spent the remainder of her career based at Philadelphia serving as a transport with the Delaware Flotilla. On 24 July 1816, the president of the Board of Navy Commissioners directed George Harrison, the Navy agent in Philadelphia, to sell Buffalo and three other ships. On 12 August 1816, she was sold to Bowers and Company for $1,100.

Its pereiopods, or legs, are long with a tapered end. The margin of the inferior extremity of its last pair of legs is serrate. Males have bigger claws than females. This species is red, blue, or green in color. Its legs are the same color and have irregular dark-brown mottling.  Habitat and distribution  This species occurs in rocky depths and in coral reefs. It is found in the Indo-Pacific from the East African coast to the Chilean coast. This includes the waters of the Red Sea, the Gulf of Aqaba, India, Indonesia, Pakistan, Japan, Australia, and the tropical islands of the Pacific Ocean (such as Hawaii).http://species- identification.org/species.php?species_group=crabs_of_japan&id;=1653  Diet  The species consumes a mostly herbivorous diet but also takes small crustaceans and fish.  Reproduction  Like in most other true crabs, light and temperature are the main environmental factors that determine reproductive activity. The female releases her fertilized eggs in its abdomen. This species has a long planktonic larval phase. As the larva matures, it undergoes a series of molts that allow it to grow and reach maturity.

Mallory ( 1843 or 1856September 4, 1920) was an American writer, publisher, editor, and spiritualist. She was also a \\"suffragist, vegetarian, and devotee of metaphysical experiences\\". Leo Tolstoy was so influenced by Mallory's magazine, the monthly spiritualist, The World's Advance Thought, that he called her the \\"greatest woman in America\\". Mallory was editor and publisher of The World's Advance Thought and the Universal Republic ‚Äî two periodicals printed under one cover ‚Äî published for more than thirty years. Early years Lucy A. Rose was born 1843 in Michigan and grew up in Roseburg, Oregon.}} Her father, Aaron Rose, settled in Oregon early in the 1840s, and the city of Roseburg was named for him. He was one of the first European settlers at a time when the country was an unbroken wilderness. Her mother, Minerva Kellogg Rose, died in giving birth to Lucy. Mallory was reared among Native Americans. Career On June 24, 1860, she married Rufus Mallory, who afterwards represented Oregon in Congress, and who was later one of the most successful lawyers in the Pacific Northwest, and was the senior member of the extensive law firm to which Senator Joseph N. Dolph belonged. She accompanied her husband to Washington, D.C., after which they returned to Salem, Oregon. In 1874, the old slavery prejudice was so strong in Oregon that some forty-five African American and mulatto children were prevented from attending the Salem public schools and kept from all chance of acquiring an education, as no Caucasian teachers would condescend to teach them. A public fund was set apart for them, but no one came forward to labor for it. Mallory volunteered to instruct the children, in the face of sneers and ridicule. Her course shamed the people into a sense of duty, and within three years, friction and opposition ended, and the children were admitted into the public schools and classes. Mallory, having no immediate use for the public money which she drew for her work, let it remain in the bank. In 1886, she used the fund for the purchase of a printing plant, and soon after, started her monthly magazine, the World's Advanced Thought, with Judge Horatio N. Maguire for assistant editor. After Maguire retired from editorial connection, on account of the pressure of other business affairs, he still contributed to its pages, while Mallory, who was always the proprietor, had full control. Her magazine circulated among advanced thinkers and workers. Tolstoy subscribed to it. Mallory established and maintained the first free reading room in Portland. For thirty years, it was open to all who would enter it. In it were many rare books of spiritualism and philosophy, as well as periodicals, not easily obtainable elsewhere. Mallory, with her All World Soul Communion hour, to be observed around the world, was the pioneer in the \\"going into the Silence\\" idea, collectively. Many New Thought groups have since practised this method of attaining unity of thought. In addition to her reading room and periodicals, Mallory kept parlors open for meetings held twice or three times a week. Often these were addressed by speakers of world reputation, but oftener, those with unusual ideas spoke there as the one place in the city where they could utter their thoughts in a friendly and hospitable atmosphere. Many tried their speaking powers here for the first time. Elizabeth Towne, publisher of Nautilus Magazine, Holyoke, Massachusetts, was one of these. Prince & Schaffer (2017) described Mallory as an \\"anarchist creative\\" with her cultural club, the Association of Artists and Authors. Mallory was always a vegetarian. Mallory was a Life Member of the National American Woman Suffrage Association. In the early 1900s, the Oregon Vegetarian Society held meetings in the \\"Advance Thought\\" parlor at the Hotel Mallory, the parlor being owned by Mallory. Personal life Notice of Mallory's memorial, Her work, like that of her husband, was in Portland, but their home was on their ranch or fruit farm, out in the suburbs of the city. She had two children, Elmer Ellsworth (1862‚Äì1918), and Lulu (1872-1872), who died after 13 days. Mallory died in 1920. Death Mallory died at age 76 in San Jose, California.

Aramoana mudflats as seen from Taiaroa Head . At its narrowest, the harbour entrance is only 400 metres wide. The Otago Heads is the historic name given to the headlands and coastal settlements close to the mouth of the long drowned volcanic rift which forms the Otago Harbour, in the South Island of New Zealand. The name has traditionally referred primarily to the settlements and headlands on the Otago Peninsula coast just inside the mouth of the harbour, from Taiaroa Head to Otakou, and to the settlements outside the harbour immediately to the north of its mouth, including Aramoana, Long Beach, and the former historic settlement at Whareakeake. In a broader sense, the term also sometimes included the parts of the Pacific coast of Otago Peninsula closest to Taiaroa Head, including Pipikaretu Beach, Penguin Beach, and Rerewahine Point. These sites were locations of early liaison between the first European settlers in Otago and local Maori; the settlement of Otakou was an important settlement prior to the founding of the city of Dunedin, at the far end of the harbour, in 1848. The heads had been an important Maori site prior to the arrival of Europeans, and are of archaeological significance.Teviotdale, D.

The narrowness of the harbour entrance and the large traffic it enjoyed, especially during the Otago Gold Rush of the 1860s, are responsible for a large number of shipwrecks and other marine incidents close to the heads. The heads are guarded by Taiaroa Head Lighthouse and Heyward Point Lighthouse. The term is still used today, though not as widely as it once was, and tends to refer to Taiaroa Head and the Aramoana Mole, which form the entrance to the harbour.

Hector was the eighth named storm, fourth hurricane, and third major hurricane of the 2018 Pacific hurricane season. It originated from a disturbance that was located north of South America on July 22\\\\. The disturbance tracked westward and entered the eastern Pacific around July 25\\\\. It gradually organized over the next several days, becoming a tropical depression at 12:00 UTC on July 31\\\\. The system was upgraded into a tropical storm about 12 hours later and received the name Hector. Throughout most of its existence, the cyclone traveled due west or slightly north of west. A favorable environment allowed the fledgling tropical storm to rapidly intensify to its initial peak as a Category 2 hurricane by 18:00 UTC on August 2\\\\. Wind shear caused Hector to weaken for a brief period before the storm began to strengthen again. Hector reached Category 3 status by 00:00 UTC on August 4 and went through an eyewall replacement cycle soon after, which caused the intensification to halt. Upon completion, the cyclone continued to organize, developing a well-defined eye surrounded by cold cloud-tops. Hector crossed the 140th meridian west, entering the central Pacific Ocean early on August 6 as a Category 4 hurricane and reaching its peak intensity around 18:00 UTC that day, with winds of 155 mph (250 km/h) and a pressure of . Hector's intensity fluctuated between Category 3 and Category 4 over the next several days as a result of eyewall replacement cycles and changing environmental conditions. The hurricane passed south of Hawaii's Big Island on August 8. Strong wind shear caused Hector to weaken rapidly and take on a more northwestward track after August 11\\\\. It fell below major hurricane intensity around 18:00 UTC on August 11 after spending 186 hours at that intensitylonger than any hurricane in the eastern Pacific basin. The structure of the storm rapidly deteriorated as Hector approached the International Date Line; it weakened into a tropical storm by 00:00 UTC on August 13\\\\. Hector crossed into the western Pacific Ocean during the middle of the day. The tropical storm then moved generally westward while continuing to decay. It weakened into a tropical depression by midnight UTC on August 15 and dissipated the next day around 18:00 UTC. While Hector did not make landfall, its close approach warranted the issuance of tropical storm watches and warnings for the Big Island, as well as tropical storm watches for the Northwestern Hawaiian Islands. Overall, the impact on land from the storm was minimal. Hector caused high surf as it passed by to the south of the main islands, necessitating the rescue of several dozen people on Oahu. Origins, development, and initial peak Hurricane Hector's origins can be traced to a low-latitude disturbance that was located north of French Guiana and Suriname around July 22\\\\. The disturbance's path prior to that time is uncertain: thunderstorm activity was subdued across the tropical Atlantic due to the presence of dry Saharan air, and the Intertropical Convergence Zone dipped southward and exhibited no fluctuations; this combination of events made it impossible to trace the disturbance to a particular tropical wave. Hector's precursor began producing convection while traveling westward over South America, entering the Eastern Pacific basin by July 25\\\\. A low-pressure trough formed on the next day south of Central America and southern Mexico. The National Hurricane Center (NHC) first mentioned the possibility of tropical development on July 26. Located within a favorable environment fueled by a kelvin wave and the Madden‚ÄìJulian oscillation, the disturbance gradually became more organized over the next five days as it continued generally westward. The system developed into Tropical Depression Ten-E around 12:00 UTC on July 31 while about 805 mi (1,295 km) south-southwest of the southern tip of the Baja California Peninsula. At that time, the system was travelling west-northwest under the influence of a deep-layer ridge to its north. Initially, the depression was irregularly shaped and its circulation elongated, but it steadily improved in organization over the next 12 hours, becoming Tropical Storm Hector at 00:00 UTC on August 1. alt=Satellite image of Hurricane Hector as a Category 2 hurricane on August 2 After strengthening into a tropical storm, Hector remained disorganized for several hours as a result of increasing easterly wind shear, with most of its convection displaced to the south and west. Warm sea surface temperatures of allowed Hector to begin a 30-hour period of rapid intensification at 12:00 UTC. Around that time, the low- and mid-level centers were becoming more aligned and curved banding features were increasing. The system also turned westward as the aforementioned ridge built to the north of Hector. Over the next several hours, Hector significantly improved in organization, with its low-level center becoming markedly embedded within the deep convection and the development of a mid-level eye. Hector intensified into a Category 1 hurricane on the Saffir-Simpson scale around 12:00 UTC, developing a small eye on satellite imagery. Six hours later, the storm reached its initial peak intensity as a Category 2 hurricane with maximum sustained winds of 105 mph (165 km/h) and a minimum central pressure of . Shortly thereafter, Hector began weakening, with its eye becoming cloud-filled and the northern eyewall eroding due to northerly shear. Hector's structure continued to degrade over the next several hours with the eye becoming nearly indistinguishable from its surroundings and the formation of a secondary concentric eyewall structure. The storm bottomed out as a Category 1 hurricane at approximately 12:00 UTC on August 3 as it continued to travel due west. Strengthening and peak intensity Hurricane Hector as seen from alt= Image of Hurricane Hector as seen from International Space Station on August 7 Hector began to strengthen a short time later as it traversed an area of slightly cooler sea temperatures, low wind shear, and elevated mid-level moisture. The storm's eye cleared out on satellite imagery as convection intensified in the eyewall. Hector became a Category 3 major hurricane around 00:00 UTC on August 4, while located approximately 1,680 mi (2,705 km) west-southwest of the southern tip of Baja California. Later in the day, the system began to undergo an eyewall replacement cycle. Six hours later, around 18:00 UTC, the eyewall cycle had completed, with only one eyewall remaining. At that time, the cyclone was also beginning to acquire some annular characteristics. The hurricane's structure began to decay on August 5, with the eye becoming less distinct by 12:00 UTC. Meanwhile, microwave imagery showed two concentric eyewalls, indicating that Hector was entering a second eyewall replacement cycle. Hector became a Category 4 hurricane at 18:00 UTC after completing the eyewall cycle. The hurricane exhibited a symmetric central dense overcast with few banding features elsewhere, a characteristic of an annular tropical cyclone. Hector began to move slightly north of west due to a weakness in a subtropical ridge located to the northeast of the Hawaiian Islands. The hurricane crossed the 140th meridian west shortly after 06:00 UTC on August 6, entering the Central Pacific Hurricane Center's (CPHC) area of responsibility. At that time, Hector possessed a distinct eye surrounded by clouds. About six hours later, a 53rd Weather Reconnaissance Squadron plane recorded a stepped frequency microwave radiometer (SFMR) wind speed of 158 mph (254 km/h) as it surveyed the cyclone. Hector reached its peak intensity with maximum sustained winds of 155 mph (250 km/h) and a minimum central pressure of around 18:00 UTC. The storm turned towards the west-northwest shortly after as the ridge continued to weaken. The hurricane maintained peak intensity for about six hours before beginning to weaken as it entered an area of mid-level dry air. Despite slightly degrading in structure, Hector still maintained a 12 mi (19 km) wide eye. Passage south of Hawaii and secondary peak alt=Satellite image of Hurricane Hector at its closest approach to Hawaii, late on August 8 As Hector approached Hawaii, its weakening trend continued due to mid-level dry air, low ocean heat content, and sea surface temperatures. The hurricane's eye shrank and became nearly indistinguishable from surrounding clouds on satellite imagery as the system tracked westward. Hector weakened into a low-end Category 3 hurricane as it passed about 230 mi (370 km) south of the Big Island on August 8. WSR-88D radar from Hawaii as well as microwave and satellite imagery showed Hector was undergoing a third eyewall replacement cycle during that time. Hurricane Hector warranted the issuance of tropical storm watches and warnings from August 6‚Äì8 as it passed near the Big Island, as well as tropical storm watches for Johnston Atoll and various islands in the PapahƒÅnaumokuƒÅkea Marine National Monument from August 9‚Äì13. Although forecasts depicted Hector remaining south of Hawaii, concerns were raised over the safety of residents displaced by the ongoing eruption of Kƒ´lauea, many of whom were in temporary tent structures that could not withstand a hurricane. Plans were made to relocate people to sturdier structures. Overall, the impact to Hawaii was minimal; peak 2-minute sustained winds of 25 mph (40 km/h) were recorded in South Point on the Big Island and of rain registered at Hilo International Airport. The ports of Hilo and Kawaihae were closed on August 7 to inbound traffic as gale-force winds were expected to occur within the next 24 hours. All Hawaiian ports resumed normal operations on August 10. Also on August 8, the acting mayor of Hawaii County, Wil Okabe, declared a state of emergency. As the hurricane passed south of the island on August 8, all absentee walk-in voting sites in Hawaii County were shut down. Whittington, Punaluu, and Milolii Beach Parks were also closed. At the same time, high surf was reported along the south-facing shores of the Big Island. At least 90 people necessitated rescue on Oahu due to dangerous swells generated by the cyclone. After passing by Hawaii, Hector began another period of strengthening on August 9 as it moved across a region of slightly warmer sea surface temperatures and higher ocean heat content. The temperature of the hurricane's eye increased and the cloud-tops of the eyewall cooled after the completion of the replacement cycle. Hector reached its secondary peak as a Category 4 hurricane around 18:00 UTC on August 10 with 140 mph (220 km/h) winds. Around that time, the system had begun a west-northwest motion as it rounded the edge of a subtropical ridge that was located northeast. Weakening and demise alt=Satellite image of Hector as a tropical depression in the western Pacific Ocean early on August 16 Hector began to weaken once more as an upper-level low located just east of the International Date Line imparted southerly shear and caused the cyclone to take on a more northwesterly track. As a result, the storm's eye became cloud-filled on August 11. Hector fell below major hurricane status around 18:00 UTC on August 11, the first time the hurricane had done so after spending a record 186 consecutive hours at that intensity. By early August 12, the hurricane's eye had become invisible on satellite imagery and only a region of warmer cloud-tops remained on infrared imagery. Hector began to rapidly weaken soon after as wind shear increased further to 35 mph (55 km/h); the appearance of the cyclone quickly deteriorated as a result. Later in the day, Hector's low-level center became displaced to the south of its thunderstorm activity as strong wind shear continued to bombard the system. Hector weakened into a tropical storm around 00:00 UTC on August 13. Convection associated with Hector began to dissipate on August 13, leaving the low-level center uncovered; all that remained were regions of cirrus clouds. Hector crossed into the western Pacific Ocean shortly after 15:00 UTC on August 13 as a weakening tropical storm, entering the Japan Meteorological Agency's (JMA) area of responsibility. Around that time, bursts of convection had formed northwest of the low-level center. At the time Hector left the eastern Pacific basin, it had the highest accumulated cyclone energy of a Pacific hurricane since 1994's Hurricane John. Once Hector crossed the International Date Line, the JMA recognized it as a tropical storm with 45 mph (75 km/h) 10-minute sustained winds. Meanwhile, the Joint Typhoon Warning Center (JTWC) estimated that Hector had 1-minute sustained winds of 45 mph (75 km/h). After entering the western Pacific, Hector tracked westward under the influence of a subtropical high. The tropical storm's structure consisted of weak banding features and a low-level center partially covered by convection on August 14. At the same time, Hector was located within an environment of dry air, low-to-moderate wind shear, and neutral sea surface temperatures. Around 06:00 UTC, the JTWC downgraded Hector to a tropical depression. Convection continually decreased in organization throughout the day. Hector restrengthened into a tropical storm around 18:00 UTC on August 14 with winds of 45 mph (75 km/h). Meanwhile, the storm turned towards the west-northwest as it rounded the southern edge of the subtropical high. At 00:00 UTC on August 15, the JMA downgraded Hector to a tropical depression. At the same time, the JTWC indicated that Hector had transitioned into a subtropical storm with no change in intensity. The JTWC downgraded Hector to a subtropical depression around 12:00 UTC on August 15\\\\. The JTWC continued tracking Hector until 06:00 UTC on August 16, while the JMA monitored the cyclone until 18:00 UTC of that day.

In this case the CCMM is a camera and telecentric lens system, which is fitted with a tactile probe. Cylindrical coordinate measuring machine or CCMM, is a special variation of a standard coordinate measuring machine (CMM) which incorporates a moving table to rotate the part relative to the probe. The probe moves perpendicular to the part axis and radial data is collected at regular angular intervals.  Description  Where the standard CMM uses a three dimensional Cartesian X, Y, Z system where each axis is orthogonal to the other, a Cylindrical Coordinate Measuring Machine omits the X or Y axis. The probe moves in only two axes (the vertical Z and either X or Y horizontal) and the rotating table positions the subject of inspection (a cylindrical part, hence the word \\"cylindrical\\" in the title) in a precise manner. The probe may be tactile in nature, or optical. Optical probing methods include laser interferometry and telecentic lensing.  Coordinate System  The CCMM coordinate system differs from standard cartesian coordinates in that it employs a rotating table. For this reason, a spherical coordinate system is employed to define the axis. A complete definition can be found here: The cylindrical coordinate system allows for the construction of crankshaft gages, transmission shaft gages and inspection machines for other shaft applications.  Uses  Where the standard CMM is suitable for prismatic parts, the Cylindrical CMM is ideally suited for cylindrical parts. Examples include camshafts, crankshafts, transmission shafts and other rotating parts with a length longer than their diameter. Parts with a length less than the diameter are typically measured on a roundness gauge.  Technology  The method for recording the angular position of the part will always make use of an optical encoder. However, the radial measurement probe may incorporate an optical technology, or tactile technology. Optical technologies include non-contact laser interferometry or shadow systems, while tactile systems use an optical grating.  Standardization  Standards similar to those used for a standard CMM, also verify the performance of the CCMM. The ISO 10360 series defines the characteristics of the probing system and the length measurement error: :PForm: probing deviation when measuring the form of a sphere :PSize: probing deviation when measuring the size of a sphere :EUni: deviation of measuring length on spheres from one direction :EBi: deviation of measuring length on spheres from left and right The ISO 10360 series consists of the following parts: *ISO 10360-1 Geometrical Product Specifications (GPS) -- Acceptance and verification tests for coordinate measuring machines (CMM) -- Part 1: Vocabulary *ISO 10360-2 Geometrical product specifications (GPS) -- Acceptance and verification tests for coordinate measuring machines (CMM) -- Part 2: CMMs used for measuring linear dimensions *ISO 10360-7 Geometrical product specifications (GPS) -- Acceptance and verification tests for coordinate measuring machines (CMM) -- Part 7: CMMs equipped with imaging probing systems *ISO 10360-8 Geometrical product specifications (GPS) -- Acceptance and verification tests for coordinate measuring systems (CMS) -- Part 8: CMMs with optical distance sensors  See also  Universal measuring machine  References   External links  * The development of cylindrical coordinate measuring machines * www.vicivisionamerica.com * www.cylindricalcmm.com * rpiuk.com Category:Industrial machinery Category:Measuring instruments Category:Metrology Category:Metalworking measuring instruments ","title":"Cylindrical coordinate measuring machine"},{"id":"58055549","text":"Heronimidae is a family of digenean trematode parasites consisting of a single genus with a single species.Pearson, J.

McHalewho had served as a storyline writer, storyboard artist, and creative director for the show in its first few seasonswrote portions of BMO's first story with his son; the two also wrote the lyrics for the song that Finn sings in this segment. Elizabeth Ito served as the episode's supervising director, and Sandra Lee served as art director. Portions of this episode were animated by Alex and Lindsay Small- Butera, a husband and wife duo had previously contributed animation to the eighth-season episode \\"Beyond the Grotto\\". The Small-Buteras were tasked with animating each of BMO and Marceline's stories in a unique style. The palette for the first segment, narrated by BMO, was based on the \\"tropical\\" feel of the Islands miniseries. However, the Small-Buteras made use of tones that were slightly \\"off\\" to give it an \\"unsettling atmosphere\\". The entire sequence featured 24 frames a second \\"to heighten [its] dream-like, sweet, but eerie quality\\". The second sequence starts off with a palette based on Princess Bubblegum's look (e.g. bright pink) and ends with a palette based on Marceline's colors (that is, \\"cool\\" colors, like grey, black, and dark blue). This sequence also used a number of unique shots and idiosyncratic angles so that it would \\"feel more cinematic and important, since it's an important story to Marceline.\\" The idea to reinterpret Bubblegum's distorted elemental self as a potato monster was inspired by the anime Akira. For the final segment, the Small-Buteras decided that they wanted to animate the story in the style of a fairy tale. To do this, they made it \\"feel very staged\\" by \\"border[ing] everything with lush, velvet curtains to sell that vision of the piece.\\" The fairy-tale version of Marceline's mother is wearing a dress that recalls a bird cage, since the character \\"is sort of a prisoner of circumstance\\". Reception \\"Ketchup\\" first aired on Cartoon Network on July 18, 2017. The episode was viewed by 0.67 million viewers and scored a 0.19 Nielsen rating in the 18- to 49-year-old demographic. Nielsen ratings are audience measurement systems that determine the audience size and composition of television programming in the United States, which means that the episode was seen by 0.19 percent of all households aged 18 to 49 years old were watching television at the time of the episode's airing. The episode will see physical release as part of the complete eighth, ninth, and tenth season DVD on September 4, 2018. Oliver Sava of The A.V. Club awarded the episode an \\"A\\" and wrote that \\"Ketchup\\" \\"is a great example of [of] how different creative voices change the series\\". Sava wrote positively of the episode's tone, use of emotion, unique animation and its use of misdirection, ultimately concluding that \\"Ketchup\\" \\"highlights the versatility of its guest animators and shows hows embracing different styles can enrich storytelling.\\" For her work animating the characters for this episode, Lindsay Small-Butera received an Emmy for \\"Outstanding Individual Achievement in Animation\\" at the 70th Primetime Creative Arts Emmy Awards, making it the show's sixth win in this category.

The newspaper was established in 1885 by John Andrew, owner of the daily Ashton Evening Reporter and several related newspapers. He believed that, in order to sell newspapers to the large number of cotton mill workers in the area, he would have to create a newspaper which specifically targeted them, in particular by including extensive reporting on issues relating to the industry in which they worked. In order to access news on the cotton industry, Andrew partnered with several well-known cotton trade unionists, including Thomas Ashton, Thomas Birtwistle and James Mawdsley. Of the eight-page newspaper, their reports filled the front page, and often one or more of the inside pages. The Oldham Operative Spinners' Association was a particular supporter of the newspaper, and in 1887 it invested ¬£1,000 in the venture. Andrew also built up a network of local correspondents to report on local events, in a section entitled \\"Voices from the Spindle and the Loom\\". The newspaper also included entertainment pages, featuring fiction in serial format, often written in Lancashire dialect, by writers including C. Allen Clarke. The paper was sold for 1d, and it soon achieved significant sales - by the early 1900s, it was claiming sales of 53,000 copies an issue. By 1889, Andrew realised that the newspaper was not selling in the neighbouring county of Yorkshire, and in response to this, he launched the Yorkshire Factory Times. This was followed, in 1890, by the Workman's Times, which was aimed at workers in non-textile trades in Lancashire, Yorkshire and Cheshire. Both of these newspapers moved to support the Independent Labour Party in the early 1890s, and by 1907 both had been sold. Sales of the newspaper fell from the mid-1900s. By 1910, it was selling 20,000 copies an issue, even as cotton trade union membership grew. Some efforts were made to reinvigorate the paper, adding a prize for the best joke, printed in a \\"Mirth in the Mill\\" section, and a cartoon drawn by Sam Fitton. At the start of World War I, it was reduced to six pages, and in 1918 down to four pages, in order to conserve paper. By this point, sales were below 10,000, but Sam Taylor, its long-term editor, resisted significant changes. Edward Andrew, John's son, became proprietor of the newspaper following his father's death, in 1906, then his brother William succeeded in 1919. For many years, they avoided making changes, but when Taylor retired in 1932, William appointed James Haslam, with a remit to relaunch the paper. The paper was again increased to eight pages, and the layout updated, while Haslam attempted to make new connections with cotton trade union leaders. Circulation continued to fall, and by 1937, sales were below 2,500. That year, the paper was finally closed.

A flare is used for signaling, illumination, or defensive countermeasures in civilian or military applications. It is based on a non-hygroscopic (not absorbing air) dilithium nitrogen-rich salt that served as an oxidizer and red colorant. The U.S. Army Research Laboratory and the Ludwig Maximilian Institution were credited as the research facilities for developing this product announced in January 2018. Formulation As of 2018, this is the first documented red- light flare compound that is based on lithium and does not contain any perchlorates, halogenated materials, or strontium-based materials. This formulation was assessed as having high color quality. To achieve the red- light emission from the flare, the authors report a formulation mixture of powdered magnesium and hexamine as fuels, nitrocellulose, an epoxy binder system, and lithium-based nitrogen salts as the oxidizer and color agent. When burned, users could observe a cool burning flame emitting a deep red color. When the flares are burned, a chemical reaction involving strontium chloride (SrCl) occurs. SrCl emits the red color after the flare is ignited. This chemical compound is known as a metastable molecular emitter, meaning, it is not stable at low temperatures but stable in excited high-temperature combustion processes. History Before 2018, the formulations for red-light emitting pyrotechnic formulations included powdered metal fuels like magnesium, aluminum, strontium nitrate and perchlorate oxidizers, as well as carbon-based chlorinated organic materials such as poly(vinyl) chloride. In 2014, the EPA made a decision to develop regulations on the amount of strontium present in drinking water. Strontium had been detected in 99% of all public U.S. water systems and at levels of concern in 7%. The agency reported that strontium is potentially harmful to human health. This chemical replaces calcium in the bone, interferes with bone strength, and affects skeletal development. The U.S. military training grounds were not included in the above study; therefore, the presence or percentage of strontium in their water systems were unknown. However, strontium was identified to be present in the red flares and signaling fireworks available in 2014. Due to these finding, the developers of the environmentally friendly red-light flare concluded the development of the environmentally safe flares were a necessity for users.

It won the Costa Book Award for a first novel, and the Ondaatje Prize. As explained in its acknowledgements, it is heavily influenced by The Adventures of David Simple by Sarah Fielding and Joseph Andrews by her brother Henry Fielding. Plot In early November 1746 a traveller called Mr Smith arrives in New York, bringing with him a bill for ¬£1000, which he takes to Mr Lovell, a local businessman, who reluctantly agrees to honour it despite Smith refusing to reveal who it is from and how he intends to use it. He meets Lovell's daughters Tabitha and Flora at home and soon afterwards also encounters Septimus Oakeshott, secretary and spymaster to George Clinton, governor of New York. He has his purse stolen and soon afterwards is saved from a murderous mob at a Pope Night bonfire by Oakeshott and his black servant (and lover) Achilles. Septimus and Smith become friends and the pair begin to plan a production of Joseph Addison's Cato, with the two female roles played by Flora and Tabitha. Smith also tentatively begins wooing Tabitha, discovering her love of theatre and frustrations with the limitations on her life at home. Impressed by the 46-year-old ex-professional actress Euterpe Tomlinson and her recitation at a dinner marking George II's birthday, Smith convinces a reluctant Septimus to give her a part in the play - forgetting until it is too late that this will lose Tabitha her role. Just after rehearsals have begun, Tabitha invites Smith to join her on a return trip to Tarrytown on her father's business. She fails to convince him to stay behind in Tarrytown and instead he accompanies her back to New York. They arrive just after the transatlantic ship expected to bring in the confirmation of his bill but it carries no such confirmation and he is imprisoned for debt and the capital crime of forgery. In gaol Smith writes a letter to his clergyman father, revealing to the reader his escape from the household of \\"Lord -\\" and his mixed-raced origin. Another ship then arrives bearing the confirmation of the bill, thus securing his release. Smith sees Tabitha at a Saint Nicholas Night celebration on 6 December, where she still seems hostile towards him. He also convinces Septimus to take over the role of Sempronius and the production proves a great success. Euterpe appears naked to Smith at a bath-house later that night and - despairing of Tabitha - he encourages and gives in to her seductions. However, the following morning they are discovered in the 69 position at his lodgings by Flora, who had been bringing a letter of reconciliation from Tabitha. Euterpe's husband is Major Tomlinson, part of the Governor's faction, meaning it seems as if Smith has sided with the New York Assembly against the Governor. Septimus challenges Smith to a duel on behalf of the Governor's faction, but secretly reveals during it that he intends merely to humiliate rather than kill his opponent. However, making a final clumsy show of resistance, Smith slips on the ice and fatally severes Septimus' femoral artery. Chief Justice James De Lancey presides over the ensuing trial, in which Smith's lawyer forces him to blacken Septimus' name by revealing the latter's homosexuality, making false allegations that Septimus had tried to blackmail Smith into sodomy and painting Smith's actions as vengeance against the decadent Governor's faction. This succeeds, meaning Smith is found guilty of manslaughter rather than murder. Guilty at his betrayal of his friend, Smith almost succumbs to a fever and then goes to Septimus' room to reclaim his purse, which Septimus had discovered and kept safe. He then goes to visit Tabitha one last time before his business is concluded, nearly convincing her to come with him until she finally alerts her family in an apparent screaming-fit. Smith immediately leaves town on a sledge with Achilles and a number of enslaved men and women he has bought for his ¬£1000. Two more letters form a coda to the novel, the first explaining to Lovell that Smith had been sent to New York by an abolitionist chapel in London to buy the freedom of a number of enslaved persons with the ¬£1000, whilst the second reveals that the preceding novel is a creation by Tabitha in 1813, attempting to imagine and understand Smith's brief stay in New York.

The Port is physically located at 2000 Wayne Sullivan Drive in Paducah, Kentucky, at the confluence of the Ohio and Tennessee Rivers and is located approximately 30 miles from the confluence of the Ohio and Mississippi Rivers. The Port is located on a section of 0.43 miles on the banks of a channel on the Tennessee River. The Port is also the northernmost, ice-free inland port facility in the U.S., which guarantees year-round shipment of cargoes and can serve as a diversion port for cargoes to be offloaded in the event of northern ports being frozen. The central location provides any industry a strategic logistical advantage, which allows the Jackson Purchase Area region of Kentucky to become a major hub for manufacturing and distribution centers access to utilize all four multimodal modes of transportation - water, rail, road, and air. The region offers a reliable supply chain model with access to over 65% ‚Äì according to the Kentucky Cabinet of Economic Development ‚Äì of the U.S. population and Canadian border within a single day's drive.  Marine Highway Designation & Container on Barge Service  MARAD's American Marine Highway Program was established by Section 1121 of the Energy Independence and Security Act of 2007 to reduce landside congestion through the designation of MARAD's Marine Highway Routes. The program was further expanded from reducing landside congestion to generate public benefits by increasing the utilization or efficiency of domestic freight or passenger transportation on MARAD's Marine Highway Routes between U.S. ports. In 2016, The National Defense Authorization Act for Fiscal Year 2016 added to the definition of short sea shipping to include cargo shipped in discrete units or packages that are handled individually, palletized or unitized for purposes of transportation; or freight vehicles carried aboard commuter ferry boats. The Paducah- McCracken County Riverport Authority submitted a MARAD's Marine Highway Designation Application for a Container on Barge Service (COB) along the M-55, M-65, and M-70 systems on December 30, 2015. After an extensive review, The Paducah-McCracken County Riverport Authority was awarded a MARAD Marine Highway Designation on July 7, 2016 from MARAD. The Paducah-McCracken County Riverport Authority is the only Department of Transportation - Maritime Administration (MARAD) Marine Highway Designation on the Ohio River and the only Marine Highway port on the Ohio River that is designated for Container on Barge service. The Paducah-McCracken County Riverport Authority intends to create the first Container on Barge service on the Tennessee River, the Ohio River, and the first in the state of Kentucky. Container on Barge (COB) service at its simplest form is a method of transportation utilizing containerized cargoes, as seen on international container ships, and placing the containerized cargoes on barges for transport throughout the inland waterway system.

Equipment  Largest Flat Top Crane in North America - Owned and Operated by the Paducah-McCracken County Riverport Authority The Paducah-McCracken County Riverport Authority operates the largest flat top crane in North America - a 53-ton Linden Comansa 30LC 1450 flat top tower crane that sits on a 25,000 sq. ft. berth. The Linden Comansa flat top crane services the General Cargo Berth area. Sennebogen Material Handler purchased in 2017 The Paducah-McCracken County Riverport Authority purchased a new material handler in 2017 - an 870 R-HD Sennebogen. Among the newest of Sennebogen designs, the distinctive look of the 870 is notable for the massive ‚ÄúGreen Hybrid‚Äù hydraulic cylinder mounted between its two main boom lift cylinders. The Green Hybrid system captures boom energy on every down movement of the boom and stores it safely in secure and protected containers at the rear of the machine. The energy is then released to assist the next lift of the boom. According to Sennebogen, this energy recovery process reduces the 870's fuel consumption by as much as 30 percent. The Sennebogen material handler places bulk cargoes on a network of conveyors, which connects the bulk products to various warehouses and outdoor storage areas on Paducah-McCracken County Riverport Authority property. This conveyor system allows for loading bulk material directly into trucks for distribution throughout mid-America.

She is the New York State Senator for the 18th district, which covers much of north Brooklyn. She won the seat as a first-time candidate after unseating incumbent Senator Martin Malave Dilan in the Democratic Party primary in 2018. She attracted national media attention for her support for sex workers rights and other views. A member of the Democratic Socialists of America, she became the first member of the organization to serve in New York's state legislature. Early life and education Salazar was born in Miami on December 30, 1990. Her mother is an American citizen by birth, and her father a naturalized American citizen from Colombia. Her parents divorced during her childhood. Salazar described being raised in \\"a conservative home\\" and at 18 registered as a Republican. In March 2010, she registered with the Independence Party of New York, believing it meant she was an independent voter. Salazar attended Columbia College, the undergraduate division of Columbia University but told The New York Times she did not earn a degree. While there, Salazar was pro- life and a member of pro-Israel Christian student groups, but later became involved in campus Jewish life and tenant organizing. After college, she became a grassroots organizer and campaigned extensively for legislation around police accountability. 2018 New York State Senate campaign In April 2018, Salazar announced her candidacy for the 18th district of the New York State Senate against incumbent Senator Martin Malave Dilan in the Democratic primary. Her campaign gained significant attention after the primary victory of Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez in New York's 14th congressional district. She was endorsed by Our Revolution, the Democratic Socialists of America, Cynthia Nixon, and Ocasio-Cortez herself. Citizens Union initially endorsed her but later revoked their endorsement, citing discrepancies in information she provided about her academic credentials. During her campaign, Salazar was criticized by Armin Rosen of Tablet, who raised questions about statements regarding her Jewish identity. Salazar describes herself as Jewish, has said that she has some Sephardic ancestry through her father, including a Sephardic surname, and that she started to explore Judaism while attending college. According to Rosen, her brother claimed their father \\"never mentioned\\" any Sephardic heritage before his death. Following the publication of Rosen's piece, Salazar's mother stated that her husband's family had a Sephardic background, while Salazar's former classmates attested to her Jewish faith in college. Salazar accused Rosen of engaging in \\"race science\\" and claimed he had threatened to publish her mother‚Äôs personal information if she didn't cooperate. He also raised questions about Salazar's immigration background, discussed in an article a week later in City & State. On September 13, 2018 Salazar defeated Dilan for the Democratic Party nomination. She was elected unopposed at the November 6 general election. On September 11, 2018, Salazar accused David Keyes, then a spokesperson for Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu, of sexual assault, stating she was preempting being outed in a story about to be published by The Daily Caller. Keyes denied assaulting her in a statement to Israeli newspaper Haaretz. Eleven additional women subsequently alleged similar instances of harassment or assault by him. Although Israel's Civil Service Commission did not find sexual harassment by Keyes occurred, he resigned from his position in December 2018. Political positions Salazar is a self-described democratic socialist, a member of the Democratic Socialists of America, and a staff organizer for Jews for Racial and Economic Justice. She supports universal rent control in New York City, decriminalization of sex work,Callie Beusman, Julia Salazar‚Äôs Win Is a Huge Victory for Sex Workers, in The Cut/New York, September 19, 2018 Medicare for All, the abolition of Immigration and Customs Enforcement, and access to abortion services. She also states that she supports the Boycott, Divestment and Sanctions movement which advocates boycotting Israel. She also supported the Housing Stability and Tenant Protection Act of 2019. Salazar characterizes democratic socialists as those who recognize capitalism to be an inherently oppressive and exploitative system who actively work to dismantle it in favor of a socialist economic system. Contrasting progressives from democratic socialists, she identifies the former as those offering palliative solutions within capitalism (without advocating for changing the system); however, she highlights the overlap between the two groups in regard to short-term policy goals. She endorsed Bernie Sanders for the 2020 Democratic presidential primary.

History  The multi-use burial mound has been associated with the Calusa. Five burials excavated early in the 20th century by Wainwright may have been from this mound. In 1975 the mound, which was originally circular, measured wide by long and high. The mound has been excavated by several archaeologists, as well as amateurs and pot hunters. Around 100 burials have been found, mostly secondary, sometimes consisting of just a skull and the long bones. While the mound was probably in continuous use, a mass burial of 35-40 individuals was found. Ceramic and other artifacts recovered from the mound in 1975 by James MIller has made the Aqui Esta one of the most significant sites in peninsular Florida. Approximately 45 rare shell cups, along with exotic incised ceramics vessels from Fort Walton and St. John, both to the north, were excavated. The most recent discovery by the ceramics curator for the Florida Museum of Natural History, in 2005, were examples of Safety Harbor ceramics that employed a paste containing mica, a mineral found closest in the Appalachians in Georgia. Luer concluded that the site correlates with the Safety Harbor Culture, 1000‚Äì1200. Recent discoveries and theories by Martin Byers concerning the Hopewell Culture and Mississippian Culture indicate that Aqui Esta was a jointly created and maintained earthwork site used by trans-regional cult members. The mound therefore may date to the period assigned by Byers, 200 B.C.

This species occurs in the northeastern Atlantic Ocean, the North Sea and the Mediterranean Sea. Description This worm is yellowish with white scales and about long with 41 segments and 16 pairs of elytra. The prostomium bears 3 antennae, with a pair of lateral antennae inserted ventrally (beneath prostomium and the median antenna). The anterior margin of the prostomium has a pair of an acute anterior projections, a pair of palps and two pairs of eyes. The first segment bears one or two chaetae and a pair of tentacular cirri on both the dorsal and ventral surfaces. The notochaetae are distinctly thicker than the neurochaetae. Unidentate and bidentate neurochaetae are present.Chambers SJ (1989) Leucia nivea: a polynoid (Polychaeta) new to the British Isles. Irish Naturalists Journal 23: 145‚Äì147. Taxonomy This species was first described by the Norwegian zoologist Michael Sars in 1863 as Polynoe nivea but was later transferred to the genus Leucia which was established for it by the Finnish zoologist Anders Johan Malmgren in 1867. For a long time this was thought to be a monotypic taxon, but during a revision of the closely related genus Harmothoe, Harmothoe violacea was reassigned to Leucia violacea.Fiege, Dieter; Barnich, Ruth.

Later he studied medicine at the University of Szeged and graduated in 1974. Then he took exams in surgery (1978), oral surgery (1988), plastic and reconstructional surgery (1998) and oncology (2009). From 1969, he worked in the Institute of Medical Chemistry of the University of Szeged as demonstrator and from 1971 in the Microbiology Institute as a TDK member. He became a clinical physician in 1974 at the No. 2 Surgeon Clinic and from 1978 an instructor. He came to the National Oncological Institute in 1981 where he became lecturer in 1984 and chief medical officer of the head-neck surgery department in 1986. He was nominated to director of the institute. He established the National Cancer Control Program for the heterogeneous medical care of cancer patients in 1993. Since 1994 he became professor at the Semmelweis University and head of department at three universities (Semmelweis University, University of P√©cs, University of Medicine and Pharmacy of T√¢rgu Mure»ô) since 1998.

During his scientific activity he wrote 16 professional books, 7 books, 76 book parts, more than 250 in and internationally published announcements and gave lectures on many national and international occasions on several instuitutes. Public activity He always showed great interest in Hungarian history and historical fate questions. His opinion is that the human of today has lost his way and his values. A kind of moral interregnum is formed when a part of the old classical, through century defecated values is lost by the humans and is now looking for a way to the solution. He appeared in a talk show on M1, a government-controlled national television channel with similarly-thinking guests (writers, scientists, and philosophers) on a series of interviews about national fate with the title Nemzeti nagyvizit (). He was a special guest of the 777blog.hu Christian public portal interview series in March 2018, when he explained how the scientists serve God and science at the same time, so serving God through science. He also gave his point of view detailed on the issue: K√°sler was a member of an international research group which came up with a result on the controversial prehistory of Hungarians which confirmed the fact that the members of the √Årp√°d dynasty are certainly from the Eurasian blood line, as genetic markers can be used to map the pharynx genetic history. Researchers determined B√©la III's genetic profile on his father's line. The research team concluded that B√©la III's DNA fragment extracted from his bone belongs to the typically co-inherited R1a haplotype. This \\"finding\\" neither falls within his area of medical expertise (genetic analysis is not part of cancer medicine), nor does it have anything with the \\"origin of Hungarians,\\" which is an \\"interpretation\\" K√°sler and his fan base attribute to it. In April 2018, K√°sler was appointed Minister of Human Resources.

Set in a theme park, the game has been described as a \\"cute em up\\", and resembles Konami's Parodius games. Gameplay Gameplay screenshot. Harmful Park is a horizontal scrolling 2D shooting game. Enemies in the game include gorillas, inflatable dinosaurs, and a gigantic woman. The game also features exotic weapons, including jellybeans and icecream. The game has six stages in total. There are four kinds of shots that the player's ship can fire, each with their own strengths and weaknesses. \\"Pie spread\\" for example fires continuously, while \\"Jelly Boomerang\\" tracks enemies, but has low attack power. Three additional minigames are available as well. Plot The game is set in a theme park, after a scientist named Dr. Tequila makes the rides and machines of the park go berserk. Another scientist orders her daughters to reclaim the park, using flying machines. The park has now been converted into a fortified base. Development Harmful Park was developed by Japanese game developer Sky Think Systems, and it was the final game they developed. The developer intended the game to have comedic elements, and to be enjoyable for a wide variety of gamers of all ages and both genders. The game is a sub-genre of shoot em ups called \\"cute em ups\\", which include elements such as humor, cute enemies, and strange power-ups. Other games in the genre include Konami's Parodius and Success's Cotton. Release The game was released in Japan on February 14, 1997. The game has become somewhat of a collector's item, and one of the rarest shooters on the PlayStation. A 2005 guide listed the game as costing between ¬£80-¬£100, while a 2014 guide listed it as costing ¬£100 in the United Kingdom in 2014. In 2012, it was re-released for the PlayStation Network in Japan. Reception Upon release, Famitsu gave it a score of 26 out of 40. Multiple reviewers noted the similarities between Harmful Park, and the Parodius series and described the game as a \\"cute em up\\". In 2014, Eurogamer listed the game among gaming's \\"most valuable treasures\\", praising the graphics, humor, and noting that while not difficult, it has personality. GamesTM described it as a cross between Parodius, and Coryoon. Retro Gamer listed it as number 6 on their list of \\"The 20 Greatest PlayStation Games You've Never Played\\".

This law enables the government to fulfill a two-fold purpose : \\"to give France a head start in the digital field by promoting an open data and knowledge policy\\" and to \\"adopt a progressive digital approach, based on individuals, to strengthen their power to act and their rights in the digital world\\". To do so, the law is organized around three lines: the circulation of data and knowledge, the protection of individuals in the digital society and access to digital for all.

She passed down the traditions of her tribal affiliation and was a revered figure among her people and in Wilcannia.  Biography  Moysey was born north of Bourke on the banks of the Warrego River near Fords Bridge. She was of Gunu descent and raised by her grandmother who taught her to speak Gunu, Margany and Wangkumara. She also learned traditional lore as a child. Moysey worked along the Darling River, working at various stations, but most often at Old Toorale and also raised her own children, grandchildren and others. She taught her grandson and artist, William Badger Bates, how to carve in the kalti paarti style. During the 1920s, Moysey was forced to take the children she cared for to the Pooncarie Aboriginal Reserve, due to a work shortage. She stayed outside the reserve in a camp she set up herself and continued to work to care for the children. On October 11, 1930, she married Leonard Alfred Moysey in Wilcannia. The couple transferred briefly to Medindee Mission Station, but returned to Wilcannia in 1939. Moysey was the last person living in her area who could perform the corroboree in the traditional way. She was known as Wilcannia's Grandmother and had a great deal of authority among her people. She kept the tribal laws and people believed that she had mekigar (or Barkindji witch doctor) knowledge.

He was the presiding judge of the 7th Chamber of the criminal division of the Nuremberg-F√ºrth District Court, Germany. Brixner became publicly known as part of the chamber that sentenced the justice victim Gustl Mollath to a forensic hospital, where he spent more than seven years. In 2011, research by journalists raised doubts about the allegations against Mollath and the procedure. In 2014, in a retrial of the case, the Regensburg regional court determined that the conditions for confinement of the accused were not satisfied.  Life and career  In the 1950s and 1960s, Otto Brixner's parents operated a restaurant in Herrenberg. As a teenager, Brixner was athletic and had a talent for handball. Brixner was an active handball player in the 1. FC Nuremberg club, and the TSV 1860 Ansbach as well as the TSV 1891 Frauenaurach. For many years, he also coached the women's handball team of the 1. FC N√ºrnberg.Ein Richter mit harter Schale. Brixner was also the coach of the Bavarian Handball C youth until 1991. After military service in the Bundeswehr, Brixner studied law. On 1 April 1973, he applied as a prosecuting attorney in the Bavarian judicial service. In his three years as a prosecutor, he was considered meticulous and, in his first official assessment, to have been \\"born\\" for this job. In 1976, Brixner became a judge at the Erlangen district court in criminal and civil cases. In October 1987, Brixner changed to the Nuremberg-F√ºrth district court, also working in criminal and civil matters. In July 1998, after his appointment as chairman of the Nuremberg-F√ºrth district court, Brixner took over the chairmanship of the 6th Chamber of the criminal division, primarily judging invocations of drug related matters. Most recently, he was chairing the 7th Chamber of the criminal court, responsible for drug and general criminal matters in the first instance. Brixner never made use of communication in criminal proceedings (a so-called \\"deal on penalty\\"). On the other hand, Brixner demanded in interviews with legislators to abolish life imprisonment and introduce temporary sentences of up to 40 years instead. Brixner retired by the end of June 2008. He was married to Christa Brixner, born Hofbauer (1946-2013). The couple had two children and four grandchildren. Brixner lives in Herzogenaurach. He is a lieutenant colonel in the reserve.  Trial of Gustl Mollath and allegations against Brixner  In September 2003, Gustl Mollath was accused of aggravated assault and false imprisonment to the detriment of his then-wife in a criminal case before the Nuremberg District Court. Since this court considered an accommodation possible, it sent the case to the Nuremberg-F√ºrth Regional Court. Under the chairmanship of Brixner, the Nuremberg-F√ºrth Regional Court in August 2006 pronounced Mollath not guilty by reason of insanity, stating that, while the deeds were proven, the \\"lack of control capability [...] according to ¬ß 20 StGB [...] could not be ruled out\\". Instead of punishment, Mollath was confined to forensic treatment in a closed psychiatric facility, as, according to the court, he continued to be a threat to society. Mollath had, in the opinion of the court, a \\"paranoid thought system \\". This was partly due to the conviction that his former wife, as an employee of the HypoVereinsbank, was involved in a complex system of money laundering. An internal audit report of the HypoVereinsbank from 2003Interner Revisionsbericht Nr. 20546 der Hypovereinsbank supports much of Mollath's money laundering allegations. However, this report had been kept secret by the bank for many years, so that it was not known to the district court of Nuremberg-F√ºrth in its ruling in 2006. In November 2012, the content of the audit report became public. The report stated that all of Mollath's verifiable allegations were accurate. Mollath's lawyer, Gerhard Strate, successfully applied for a retrial in August 2013. The district court of Regensburg finally came to the conclusion that the prerequisites for Mollath's confinement to psychiatry were not met. These events resulted in a committee of inquiry in the Bavarian state parliament and public debate. Also, the presiding judge, Brixner, was publicly accused. Jurors and witnesses reported that Brixner acted uncontrollably during the trial and interrupted Mollath whenever he began to talk about the money laundering. = Trial = Brixner presided at Mollath's trial in 2006. Juror Karl-Heinz Westenrieder said in a TV interview that Brixner had loudly interrupted Mollath and threatened to ban him from the courtroom whenever he mentioned tax evasion or money laundering. A listener during the trial described Brixner as very uncontrolled and angry. Brixner reportedly shouted at Mollath for eight hours without interruption and spoke in a very harsh tone. = Possible bias = Brixner was accused of partiality as a result of media research. In mid-April 2013, Brixner reportedly confirmed that Martin Maske, the future husband of Mollath's former wife Petra, was already dating her during the 2006 criminal trial. In 1980, Brixner was Maske's handball coach. Brixner allegedly kept this secret during the entire criminal proceedings. According to a subsequent written statement before the committee of inquiry in the Bavarian Parliament by a now retired associate judge in the trial of Mollath in 2006, Maske and Mollath's former wife Petra met and talked with Brixner during the Mollath trial. This contradicts Maske's statement that he had no contact with Brixner since the early 1980s. On 5 July 2013, Brixner acknowledged that a meeting with Maske might have taken place during the criminal proceedings in 2006.Anzeichen f√ºr eine Befangenheit Brixners verdichten sich ; in: Internet-Portal der SPD-Landtagsabgeordneten Inge Aures = Denial of the right to be heard / falsification of the facts = In his application for reactivating the case, Mollath's later lawyer, Gerhard Strate, alleged among other things that Brixner had determined the makeup of the court himself, refrained from hearing the accused, and willfully falsified the facts of the case using the documentation available to him.Volltext des Wiederaufnahmeantrags in Sachen Gustl Mollath vom 19. Brixner was also repeatedly criticized for never taking note of the 106-page binder provided by Mollath and containing what he claimed to be exculpatory evidence. The outrage against Brixner was ignited by the fact that it is the fundamental obligation of all German courts to take full note of the case of the parties. This arises from the fundamental right to be heard (Art. 103 Para. 1, Basic Law). = Influence on the Ministry of Finance = In the run- up to the criminal proceedings, in a telephone conversation with the Ministry of Finance, Brixner allegedly halted the investigation by the tax authorities of Mollath's allegations concerning money laundering.

The religious minority, the Hindus, were victims of targeted violence by supporters of Bangladesh Nationalist Party. Background In the 2001 Bangladeshi general election the ruling Bangladesh Awami League led by Sheikh Hasina was defeated by the opposition party, Bangladesh Nationalist Party led by Khaleda Zia. Violence broke out between Bangladesh Awami League supporters and supporters of Bangladesh Nationalist Party with the support of Bangladesh Police. Incident The violence mostly occurred in South West Bangladesh which had large Hindu communities. The attacks started after the election victory of Bangladesh National Party. The attacks were systematic with a motive to destroy the economic resources of the Hindu community, terrorize them into fleeing to India, and grabbing their properties. Hindus were targeted in Bagerhat District, Barisal District, Bhola District, Bogra District, Brahmanbaria District, Chittagong District, Feni District, Gazipur District, Jhenaidah District, Jessore District, Khulna District, Kushtia District, Munshiganj District, Natore District, Narayanganj District, Narsingdi District, Pirojpur District, Sirajganj District, Satkhira District, and Tangail District. In October 2001 in Lalmohan Upazila, Bhola District, Bangladesh Nationalist Party supporters attacked Hindus and Bangladesh Awami League supporters. They looted Hindu houses and houses of Muslims who provided shelter to Hindus. Women and children were raped by the attackers. The attackers looted everything from the houses and cut down trees on the victims properties. Mohammad Badrul Ahsan wrote in 16 November 2001 about 200 Hindu women were gang raped by members of Bangladesh Nationalist Party in Char Fasson Upazila, Bhola District. The youngest was 8 year old and the oldest was 70 year old. In Tuniaghara, Manirampur Upazila, Jessore District six Hindu families were forced to leave the area and two women were raped. Reactions and legacy Newspaper analysis blamed the violence on inadequate law enforcement activities. They also blamed the unpreparedness of the local government and administration to tackle violence. In 2009, Bangladesh High Court ordered the a judicial investigation into the post election violence. In 2011 the judicial commission submitted the findings of its investigation. The report found evidence of targeted violence against the Hindu community by 25 thousand people which included 25 Ministers and Member of Parliaments of the Bangladesh Nationalist Party-Jamaat-e-Islami led alliance government. The reported was rejected by Bangladesh Nationalist Party and accused the investigation of being partisan. The commission reported that the number of rapes committed exceeded 18 thousand. The report also notes incidents of violence, arson, looting, and torture against the minority Hindu community of Bangladesh. In 2011, a court in Sirajganj District sentenced 11 individuals to life time imprisonment for rape of school girl in the 2001 post election violence.

Enchantment Peak is part of The Enchantments within the Alpine Lakes Wilderness. Enchantment Peak belongs to the Stuart Range which is subset of the Cascade Range. Enchantment Peak is situated midway between Prusik Peak to its east, and Aasgard Pass and Dragontail Peak to the west. Precipitation runoff drains into Icicle Creek, a tributary of the Wenatchee River. Climate Most weather fronts originate in the Pacific Ocean, and travel east toward the Cascade Mountains. As fronts approach, they are forced upward by the peaks of the Cascade Range, causing them to drop their moisture in the form of rain or snowfall onto the Cascades (Orographic lift). As a result, the Cascades experience high precipitation, especially during the winter months in the form of snowfall. During winter months, weather is usually cloudy, but, due to high pressure systems over the Pacific Ocean that intensify during summer months, there is often little or no cloud cover during the summer.Beckey, p. 16 Because of maritime influence, snow tends to be wet and heavy, resulting in high avalanche danger. Geology The Alpine Lakes Wilderness features some of the most rugged topography in the Cascade Range with craggy peaks and ridges, deep glacial valleys, and granite walls spotted with over 700 mountain lakes. Geological events occurring many years ago created the diverse topography and drastic elevation changes over the Cascade Range leading to the various climate differences. The history of the formation of the Cascade Mountains dates back millions of years ago to the late Eocene Epoch. With the North American Plate overriding the Pacific Plate, episodes of volcanic igneous activity persisted. In addition, small fragments of the oceanic and continental lithosphere called terranes created the North Cascades about 50 million years ago. During the Pleistocene period dating back over two million years ago, glaciation advancing and retreating repeatedly scoured the landscape leaving deposits of rock debris. The last glacial retreat in the Alpine Lakes area began about 14,000 years ago and was north of the Canada‚ÄìUS border by 10,000 years ago. The \\"U\\"-shaped cross section of the river valleys are a result of that recent glaciation. Uplift and faulting in combination with glaciation have been the dominant processes which have created the tall peaks and deep valleys of the Alpine Lakes Wilderness area.

James Tissot c.1900 The Bible records various proscriptions and instances of the death penalty. Against capital punishment While the Bible very clearly condones and commands capital punishment, there are verses that can be interpreted as being against capital punishment. For example, when Cain murdered Abel, God sentenced him to wandering as a fugitive rather than to death, and even issued a warning against killing Cain. A similar sentiment is suggested in Proverbs 28:17. We see from 2 Samuel 14:1-11 that kings would grant clemency in extenuating circumstances. In that case, the one who had killed was an only child, and the king allowed him to remain alive under house arrest. We find that the prophets, repeatedly beseech the masses to repent so that God will not destroy them. Additionally, there are numerous verses that condemn revenge, judging, anger and hatred, as well as those that promote peace harmony, forgiveness and acceptance.Richard H. Hiers, The Death Penalty and Due Process in Biblical Law, 81 U. Det. Mercy L. Rev. 751 (2004) Hiers (2004 & 2009) shows that the laws related to capital punishment shifted over time with old laws being abandoned, and new laws taking their place; however, he points out that some later laws seem to mitigate the severity of earlier one's. He further quotes quotes Glen Stassen who argues that even in biblical times, capital punishment was like, \\"gradually, if not progressively\\" being abandoned, pointing out that capital punishment is rarely found in the Prophets and the Writings. Paul Onyango cites Carol Meyers argues that treatment of adulteresses in Ezekiel 16 and 23 is far more progressive than that of other ancient near eastern cultures of the time, due to its avoidance/rejection of capital punishment.Wahonya, Paul Onyango, \\"Ezekiel 5:5-17 and Theodicy: a Theological Investigation of the Character of God\\" (2011). Dissertations. 163. Page 21. \\"examining the horrific imagery of Ezekiel in its ancient context using anthropological perspectives and legal analysis indicates that the punishment for adultery turns out to be one of relative leniency rather\\" Perhaps the strongest case against capital punishment can be made from John 8, where Jesus seems to say that capital punishment should not be carried out contrary to Mosaic law. In John 8, the Pharisees challenge Jesus by presenting a woman who they say committed adultery. They point out that the law of Moses clearly states that such a woman ought be stoned, and challenge Jesus to give his opinion as to what should be done. Jesus famously states \\"let he who is without sin throw the first stone.\\" Effectively saying that capital punishment should not be carried out, without directly contradicting the law of Moses. While these examples may show that there was at least some opposition to capital punishment and decline in usage, there can be no doubt that there are far more numerous verses that command and condone capital punishment, and examples of it being carried out. Old Testament =Capital sins= The Bible states that for the death penalty to be carried out, at least two witnesses were required.Numbers 35:30Deuteronomy 17:6; Deuteronomy 19:15 (According to Rabbinic tradition, there were numerous other conditions/requirements (such as a warning) that made it difficult to get a conviction.) Sins that were punishable by death in the Torah, included the following: Homicide (including negligent homicide),Exodus 21:12-14, 20-23, 28-32; Leviticus 24:17, 21; 35:6-34; Deuteronomy 19 4-13 (In the last 2 sources, if a death occurred due to negligence, a relative may take revenge by killing the one who caused the death. However, if the one who caused the death reaches one of the designated sanctuary cities, the relative may not kill him while he is there.) striking one's parents,Exodus 21:15 kidnappingExodus 21:16; Deuteronomy 24:7 \\"If a man is found to have kidnapped a fellow Israelite, enslaving him or selling him, that kidnapper shall die; thus you will sweep out evil from your midst.\\" (JPS) cursing one's parents,Exodus 21:17; Leviticus 20:9 witchcraft and divination,Exodus 22:17 or 22:18 (this verse mentions only a female sorceress); Leviticus 20:6; Leviticus 20:27 \\"A man or a woman who has a ghost or a familiar spirit shall be put to death\\" (JPS) bestialityExodus 21:18 or 22:19; Leviticus 20:15-16 If a man has carnal relations with a beast, he shall be put to death; and you shall kill the beast. If a woman approaches any beast to mate with it, you shall kill the woman and the beast; they shall be put to death‚Äîtheir bloodguilt is upon them.(JPS) worshiping other gods,22:19 or 22:20; Deuteronomy 17:2-5 violating the SabbathExodus 31:15; 35:2, child sacrifice,Leviticus 20:2 adultery,Leviticus 20:10, Deuteronomy 22:22 incest,Leviticus 20:11-12, 14 and male homosexual intercourse (there is no biblical legal punishment for lesbians).Leviticus 20:14 The daughter of a Kohen who defiles herself through harlotry,Leviticus 21:9 blaspheme (of the Tetragrammaton name of God),Leviticus 24:14-16 a non-Levite \\"encroaching\\" on the Levite task of setting up or taking down the Tabernacle,Numbers 1:51 a non-Kohen carrying out priestly duties,Numbers 3:10, 3:38; 17:5; 18:7 promoting the worship of other gods (if an entire town is swayed by such people, the entire town is to be put to death and destroyed),Deuteronomy 13:5-18 defiantly refusing to accept a court's ruling,Deuteronomy 17:8-12 maliciously giving false testimony accusing another person of having committed a capital offence,Deuteronomy 19:16-21 rebellion against parents,Deuteronomy 21:18-21 \\"If a man has a wayward and defiant son, who does not heed his father or mother and does not obey them even after they discipline him, his father and mother shall take hold of him and bring him out to the elders of his town at the public place of his community. They shall say to the elders of his town, ‚ÄúThis son of ours is disloyal and defiant; he does not heed us. He is a glutton and a drunkard.‚Äù Thereupon the men of his town shall stone him to death. Thus you will sweep out evil from your midst: all Israel will hear and be afraid.\\"(JPS translation) If a man marries a girl and claims that she is not a virgin, the girl's parents should produce evidence of her virginity. If it is found that she was not a virgin, she is stoned to death for fornicating while still under her father's authority,Deuteronomy 22:13-21 intercourse with an engaged/betrothed virgin girl (if she could have cried out for help and did not, she is killed as well).Deuteronomy 22:23-27 \\"In the case of a virgin who is engaged to a man‚Äîif a man comes upon her in town and lies with her, you shall take the two of them out to the gate of that town and stone them to death: the girl because she did not cry for help in the town, and the man because he violated another man‚Äôs wife... But if the man comes upon the engaged girl in the open country, and the man lies with her by force, only the man who lay with her shall die, but you shall do nothing to the girl, for... the engaged girl cried for help, there was no one to save her.\\" (JPS translation) Not all instances capital punishment were necessarily to be carried out by humans. There are numerous instances where God issues a warning that getting too close to holy things will result in death. For example, numerous warnings against non-levites/Kohanim getting too close to holy things related to Tabernacle/Temple,Numbers 4:15, 4:19-20; 18:3, 18:22 =Methods= The most common method mentioned is by stoning, followed by burning, and then by sword (once). There is a verse that mentions hanging; however, it isn't clear whether this is a separate method of killing, or something done with the body after it was dead. The verse goes on to command that the body is not to be left up overnight, but rather must be buried that day, since an impaled/hanging body was offensive to God.Deuteronomy 21:21-22 =Examples of capital punishment= In the Genesis creation narrative (Book of Genesis 2:17), God tells Adam \\"But of the Tree of Knowledge of good and evil you shall not eat of it, for on the day that you eat thereof, you shall surely die.\\"Chabad, Genesis 2 According to the Talmud, this verse is a death penalty.Babylon Talmud, Sanhedrin 55b. In Genesis 38:24-26, when Judah is told that Tamar (his former daughter-in-law) had become a harlot and was pregnant, he sentences her to death by burning. However, she proves that he (Judah) is the father, and (apparently) the ruling is reversed. During the period that the Israelites wandered the wilderness, examples include: A man was stoned for gathering wood on Sabbath,Numbers 15:32-36 while another was stoned for blasphemy.Leviticus 24:23 In the rebellion of Korah, the ground opened up swallowing Korah, other leaders, and their families; and a heavenly fire consumed another 250 followers. The next day, all the Israelites railed against Moses and Aaron, blaming them for the deaths, and God sent a plague that killed another 14,700.Numbers 16:1-17:15 or Numbers 16:1-50 During the period of Kings, examples include: Elijah captured and \\"slaughtered\\" the prophets of Baal.Kings 18:40 King Asa and the tribes who followed him made a covenant to worship God and \\"whoever would not worship the LORD God of Israel would be put to death.\\" 2 Chronicles 15:12-14 King Ahab eliminated Naboth (to get his land) by getting false witnesses to testify that Naboth had blasphemed God and the King.I Kings 21:1-16 In the uprising against Athaliah when Jehoash was appointed king of Judah, Mattan, the priest of Baal was killed.Kings 11:18; 2 Chronicles 23:17 New Testament = Sermon on the Mount = The Sermon on the Mount rejects \\"an eye for an eye\\" and thus, implicitly, retributive justice, which has been argued to include capital punishment.The Death Penalty, Church of Scotland Church and Society Council, May 2008 Whether supportive or not, commentators establish the relevance of the Sermon to considerations of capital punishment,Davison M. Douglas, God and the Executioner: The Influence of Western Religion on the Use of the Death Penalty, 9 Wm. & Mary Bill Rts. J. 137 (2000) https://scholarship.law.wm.edu/wmborj/vol9/iss1/ for example Augustine, who cites it in his analysis supporting capital punishment as carried out by duly constituted authority.Commentary on the Lord‚Äôs Sermon on the Mount in Fathers of the Church in Fathers of the Church, vol. 59, 79, 90, 91; Augustine, Letter 87, cited in Augustine and the Death Penalty: Justice as the Balance of Mercy and Judgment, Phillip M. Thompson, Augustinian Studies 40:2 (2009) 181‚Äì203 In 2018 the Roman Catholic catechism changed to repudiate capital punishment in any circumstances,Pope Francis changes Catholic Church teaching to say death penalty is ‚Äòinadmissible‚Äô, The Washington Post, August 2, 2108 and the Vatican website explicitly references the Sermon on the Mount in justification for this.Catechism of the Catholic Church, vatican.va =Woman caught in adultery= John 8:3-11 mentions a woman caught in adultery being brought to Jesus for judgment.USCCB Bible John 8:3-11 Then the scribes and the Pharisees brought a woman who had been caught in adultery and made her stand in the middle. They said to him, \\"Teacher, this woman was caught in the very act of committing adultery. Now in the law, Moses commanded us to stone such women.* So what do you say?\\" They said this to test him, so that they could have some charge to bring against him. Jesus bent down and began to write on the ground with his finger. But when they continued asking him, he straightened up and said to them, \\"Let the one among you who is without sin be the first to throw a stone at her.\\" Again he bent down and wrote on the ground. And in response, they went away one by one, beginning with the elders. So he was left alone with the woman before him. Then Jesus straightened up and said to her, \\"Woman, where are they? Has no one condemned you?\\" She replied, \\"No one, sir.\\" Then Jesus said, \\"Neither do I condemn you. Go, [and] from now on do not sin any more.\\" Jesus does not condemn her, but says \\"Go and from now on do not sin any more.\\" =Death of Jesus= Jesus is sentenced to death and dies on a cross in all four Gospels.Matthew 27:26, 35, 50. Mark 15:15, 24, 37. Luke 23:25, 33, 46. John 19:16, 18, 30. =Ananias and Sapphira= In Acts 5:1-11, Saint Peter spoke words of judgment upon Ananias and Sapphira for lying to God (Ananias) and testing the Spirit (Sapphira), after which each of them fell dead.USCCB Bible Acts 5 A man named Ananias, however, with his wife Sapphira, sold a piece of property. 2 He retained for himself, with his wife's knowledge, some of the purchase price, took the remainder, and put it at the feet of the apostles. 3 But Peter said, \\"Ananias, why has Satan filled your heart so that you lied to the holy Spirit and retained part of the price of the land? 4 While it remained unsold, did it not remain yours? And when it was sold, was it not still under your control? Why did you contrive this deed? You have lied not to human beings, but to God.\\" 5 When Ananias heard these words, he fell down and breathed his last, and great fear came upon all who heard of it. 6 The young men came and wrapped him up, then carried him out and buried him. 7 After an interval of about three hours, his wife came in, unaware of what had happened. 8 Peter said to her, \\"Tell me, did you sell the land for this amount?\\" She answered, \\"Yes, for that amount.\\" 9 Then Peter said to her, \\"Why did you agree to test the Spirit of the Lord? Listen, the footsteps of those who have buried your husband are at the door, and they will carry you out.\\" 10 At once, she fell down at his feet and breathed her last. When the young men entered they found her dead, so they carried her out and buried her beside her husband. 11 And great fear came upon the whole church and upon all who heard of these things. Deuteronomy 6:16 forbids testing the Lord.Chabad, Deuteronomy 6 You shall not try the Lord, your God, as you tried Him in Massah. John Chrysostom, in Homily 12 on Acts, says that no one was forced to give anything to the apostles,New Advent: John Chrysostom's Homily 12 We neither obliged you to sell, the Apostle says, nor to give your money when you had sold; of your own free choice you did it; why have you then stolen from the sacred treasury? ...But wherefore, upon what purpose have you done this?

History  The art of kalti paarti carving was popularized in the mid to late nineteenth century. Some of the earliest carvers were not strictly Aboriginal and these carvers created very decorative and complicated designs that were popular at the time. The art was continued by Aboriginal artists from south- east Australia and the Carnarvon region, especially after World War II. As Aboriginal people of Australia sought out a sense of identity, these artists became to use symbols based on traditional markings and designs. Artists like Bluey Roberts, Badger Bates and Adrian Morten created these types of designs. Esther Kirby and Barry Belotti went on to create realistic carvings that \\"critique colonial incursion.\\" Various designs of kalti paarti carving can indicate where the egg was carved.

Similar to travel medicine, it is an interdisciplinary practice which draws from the knowledge bases of vaccines, epidemiology, tropical medicine, public health and health education. Throughout the recent years, it has become an emerging profession, increasing high in demand, due to the evolution of travel medicine in the last two decades. The significance of a travel health nurse was recognized in 1996, hence additional education and training was provided to them in order to develop their service. Moreover, travel health nurses are seen working in \\"private practice, hospital outpatient units, universities, the government, and the military\\". Since, the importance of travel health has been acknowledged, travel health nurses have more opportunities consisting leading roles, within the health care sector practices. However, travel health nurses tend to face a number of conflicts amongst the GPs and patients in healthcare settings.  History  Travel medicine was developed over two decades ago. It aims to prevent all disease and illnesses during travelling and provides ultimate care to travelers who're prone to risk. It's been evolving over 30 years. Overall it has been more acknowledged after it was seen being practiced in other healthcare settings such as occupational health, college health clinics emergency departments, pharmacies, and supermarkets. Moreover, along with the acknowledgment of travel medicine over several years, the importance of establishing travel medicine clinics has also been recognized in the healthcare department; considering prevention methods to improve morbidity and mortality. Travel health nursing has been widely acknowledged in the United States throughout recent years. In 1996, an international study confirmed that nurses play a significant role in providing health education to travelers. However, they were not qualified and educated enough to fully succeed in their roles. Hence, nurses demanded more training in order to be able to deliver a better service. In 2004, when travel medicine got more recognized amongst 91 general practices, 97% of the health advisers were nurses, and 75% of nurses worked while receiving higher-level education and training. Profession Travel health nurses primarily work in travel health clinics, the military, the government, and some large ambulatory care practices. Their work covers pre-travel care, with a focus on disease prevention and health promotion while patients are away from their home. Travel health nurses assess the potential travelers health and their destination risks in order to implement a plan of preventive care that can include immunizations and travel medications and supplies. These nurses offer health counselling and education for prospective travelers along with education regarding how to manage their chronic conditions while away from home. Often, referrals for care during travel is provided either for anticipated needs or in case of a health emergency. = Their Role = Health issues that are accompanied by travelling require more consideration, as they can be highly prevalent and bring detrimental consequences, causing further global issues. Consequently, as a profession, travel health nursing has been emerged throughout the years and the need for more nurses in travel health clinics have increased rapidly. In America, nurses who provide travel health care have been in demand and the number of nurses progressively increased.  Pre travel care  A pre travel care is required for which the nurses have to go through an evaluation for the health and safety hazards, along with constructing a customized plan of care, which covers immunizations, travel medications and supplies, self-care counselling, and referrals. Nurses start a pre travel assessment (phase 1) which includes all details of their travel health history (of a six-month period).The pre- travel consultation. (2020). Retrieved 29 May 2020, from https://www.racgp.org.au/afpbackissues/2007/200705/200705gherardin.pdf These details include; * Demographics: the client‚Äôs age, gender, country of birth * Medications: prescription drugs, over the counter medicines, herbal medications * Medical history: chronic health issues (heart disease, diabetes), pregnancy, surgeries, mental or psychiatric problems * Allergies: vaccines, foods, medications, environmental triggers, anaphylaxis history * Immunization: documentation, vaccination dates, any adverse reactions * Travel illness: any experience with trip illness or injury, experience with healthcare in other countries, first aid knowledge and experience using travel medications Collecting this information can be a challenging task for a nurse, as most of the travelers come unprepared and are unaware about their health details. After health history information is gathered, the nurse then completes information about the trip itself. This information includes; * Destination: Every destination, including stops. * Duration of travel: dates of departure and arrival as well how long the individual stayed at a particular destination * Type of travel: urban/rural, work related, backpacking, group, family holiday, or individual trip * Transportation: type of transportation and accommodation; hotel, camping houses, or hostel * Type of activities planned over trip: work or leisure, activities including water, contact with people and animals, and sexual activity After this, nurses have to go through phase 2 of the pre-travel health care, which is the trip planning. This phase includes research and risk identification. Using their expertise, nurses identify all the health risks that can be associated with this particular trip for the specific traveller. This is done by looking at all the primary factors that can be associated with risk such as; * Unstable medical conditions: such as cardiovascular and respiratory issues, musculoskeletal problems, and mental health or psychiatric issues * Traveler age: younger and older travelers who are prone to disease more * Pregnancy: increases trip risk, first and third trimester are most prone to risk * Medication and drug use: certain medications (diuretics can increase risk). Alcohol use and illegal drugs are a threat to health and safety during travel * Destination: travelling to remote, rural, and underdeveloped destinations; travelling to destinations with lack of health and safety services * Trip duration: Longer trips associate with more risk * Season of travel: rainy and, dry seasons can be a risk for infectious diseases * Overseas work assignments: can result in occupational risks * Contact with local individuals: interaction with local residents, especially children, refugees, and ill individuals, increases the risk for infectious disease * Leisure activities: such as rafting, caving, mountain climbing, riding motorcycles, and scuba diving can increase the risk for trauma and accidental death Finally, nurses start phase three which is a pharmacological intervention. After phase two, the nurse is required to form a prevention plan for the traveler, which includes pharmacological and non-pharmacological measures that helps reduce risk. This prevention plan consists of precautions to be consumed before after and during the trip, in order to prevent risk to the traveler‚Äôs health and safety. During the process of recommending vaccines, the travel health nurse needs to take into account of the client‚Äôs medical history, immunization history, age, pregnancy, allergies as well as date of departure, and trip duration. The nurse also must evaluate the individual toughly before deciding on the schedule of dose requirements to minimize further risk and adverse effects. After this phase, the travel health nurse needs to cover phase four which is the final phase. The fourth phase focuses on health education and health counselling. Most travel health issues are not preventable by vaccines, therefore, with the use of statistics and educations nurses help travellers reduce risk while travelling. The nurses utilize different teaching methods (handouts, audiovisuals, role play) which are practical and effective and helps them communicate with the traveller on a greater level. Alongside teaching 10 different topics, the nurses focus on vehicle safety and air travel hazards. Tourists tend to have major risk on the road than a local individual. Poor road safety laws in foreign countries and signs in foreign languages and drink driving can increase the risk for car accidents and injuries. Moreover, air travel hazards are health conditions which a traveller experiences due to the duration of a long flight. These include jet lag, travel thrombosis aortitis, airborne illnesses, and air rage.  Post travel care  Furthermore, nurses bound to take care of the traveller post travel as well. Travellers who return from their trip with an injury or illness, are taken care of with a post-travel treatment and diagnosis offered by the nurses. In this phase, the travel health nurses are required to work with a team of specialists in infectious disease, dermatology, trauma, and gastrointestinal illnesses. Additionally, nurses also provide the traveler with trip support and professional development and management.  Scope of activities  Many travellers are at a risk for disease, which depends on the factors such as destination, the season of travel, prevention measures used. Chronic illness patients, people disabilities and pregnant women also travel, hence they are more at risk of disease and illness while travelling. The travellers experience many health problems including jet lag, sleep disruption and other sleep-related disorders. This is due to travel in between different time zones. Other illness associated to travelling can be diarrhoea, food poisoning and other vector-borne illnesses which can be high risk; especially for people who are travelling in fatal conditions. Hence throughout the years, as travel health got more importance, travel health nurses got recognized more. They now have a leading role in hospitals, travel health clinics, occupational health departments and general practices. Furthermore, there has been a global need for the expansion and growth for travel clinics. Establishment of numerous travel health clinics, alongside with employing travel health nurses, who are professionally trained and consistently supervised with a high level of expertise can result in successful travel clinic operations. Therefore, travel health nurses are high in demand as they are needed to provide medical and health advice to patients post or pre travelling. In the United States. travel health programs consisting of pre- travel services. Advanced nurses also contribute to these services, as well as managing their own practices. Moreover, the availability of educational programs for travel health nursing is expanding and the services are developing as well. Moreover, with travel health nurses working locally and regionally, the future of this profession is promising. = Prescribing medication = Although, pharmacology is an important component to study in order to achieve scope in a travel health nurses career, 95% or more travel health nurses have educational needs and are required to seek further education, in order to prescribe medicine. Many travel health nurses desire to prescribe medicine to patients, although travel medicine is a complicated yet, growing area of medicine, therefore, there are legal and occupational requirements for this process which causes occupational hazards. These requirements include; travel health staff must be competent and qualified immunization, travel health and prescribing. They are expected to have appropriate training, including all professional development in their personal development plan. They must seek all their information from reliable, latest and recognized sources. They should understand the restrictions associated with prescriptions, patient group directions (PGDs) and patient-specific directions (PSDs). They should be able to comprehend the principles of risk assessment and know how to apply them to the traveller. Additionally, practitioners are under full responsibility whilst recommending, administrating or even prescribing vaccines/medicine, hence they have to be fully aware about the implications associated at all times.  Occupational Hazards  Travel health nurses have to face many challenges throughout their profession. Travel health nurses from UK, Japan and Australia were asked about their challenging times during their job. Most of them stated that time was one of the main and most challenging difficulty encountered during their practice. These ‚Äòtime issues‚Äô were specifically, appointment timing, allocated times with the traveller, moreover, the length of meeting administrative requirements was an issue as well. Another challenge that is mostly faced by travel health nurses is lack of educational opportunities and accredited training programs takes additional fees including travel expenses. Training and education also took time and was a challenge faced by the nurses. The main barriers to further education for nurses was time, time off work and costs. Practice nurses are expected to deliver care, yet they lack travel health training experience. Another occupational hazard nurses face daily, is problem patients. Some patients fail to understand the seriousness of some situations that could result in poor consequences if their advice is ignored or not followed. Even worse ramifications can take place when these are vulnerable patients (chronically ill patients, pregnant women, infants or elderly). This disrupts the quality of health care. Lack of financial support from employers is also seen as a barrier. Nurses usually have to work under a certain budget in order to meet standards of care, hence extra effort and hard work is required from the nurses. Conflicts may occur between GPS and nurses coming across the knowledge and understanding of travel medicine in general. Moreover, legislation issues are experienced during the need to prescribe medicine or vaccination.

In his early life he was a member of the Peepeekisis Band, the File Hills Reserve He attended Lebret Industrial School also known as Qu'Appelle Indian Residential School (Q.I.R.S.) located on the outskirts of Lebret, Saskatchewan, for 12 years, including when it later opened as St. Paul's High School in 1948. He received his grade 12 diploma in June 1957. In 1999, George Poitras filed a lawsuit alleging he was abused by a priest during his time at Lebret. In 2004 he received some reparation for the abuse suffered.  Sports  Sports were a very important method of assimilation at the residential schools and Lebret, for one, \\"developed outstanding athletic programs\\" and athletes. George Poitras was one of four students from the school who received the Tom Longboat Award established by Indian Affairs and the Amateur Athletic Union of Canada. Arthur Obey (in 1951 and 1960), Gerald Starr (1954), and Herbert Strongeagle (1953) were the other three. Sports and games were used by students to endure their institutionalization. Zeman, et al. report that the first native high school and sports were introduced in 1948 by Father Paul Piechet. In contrast, Sister Marcoux reports that Mr. Ed Doll started building the juvenile hockey team in 1946. The Qu‚ÄôAppelle team sweater was made to resemble those of the Montreal Canadiens, with the CH logo being replaced by an ‚ÄúIndian head‚Äù. Official sources such as the Saskatchewan Hockey Association refer to the hockey team as the Lebret Indians, though other sources referenced may use Lebret Pucksters or the Lebret Eagles. Poitras attended Qu'Appelle Indian Residential School from roughly 1945-57. He played hockey, baseball, rugby and basketball while there. The high school sports teams were very successful during, and after, his tenure: * 1952: Qu'Appelle Valley Intermediate Hockey League, First Place aka Q.V.H.A Champions.

He is from New York and his business background is in running gambling operations, high-end used jewelry, and telemarketing.  Early life and education  Cornstein was born in New York City on August 17, 1938. As the only child of Irwin, who worked in the rug business, and Fanny, a schoolteacher, Cornstein grew up in the city. His maternal grandparents immigrated to the U.S. from Hungary. Cornstein attended P.S.168 in The Bronx and later attended Horace Mann School, graduating in 1956. He earned a B.A. in 1960 from Lafayette College in Easton, Pennsylvania, where he is still a donor and part of the university's Marquis Society today. He subsequently earned an M.B.A. from New York University (NYU). Cornstein then served as a cook in the Army Reserve.  Career  Cornstein started his career while studying at NYU. He opened a jewelry counter in a J. C. Penney store in Long Island and later expanded the operations into a company called Tru-Run, selling jewelry in department stores throughout the U.S. Cornstein served as the president, chief executive officer, and a director. The company bought a similar firm, Seligman and Latz, in 1985 and Finlay Fine Jewelry for $217 million in 1988. Cornstein formed a new holding company, Finlay Enterprises, where be became president and chief executive in December 1988 and continued as a director of Finlay Fine Jewelry. The company continued to grow through the economic downturn in 1989, and in the 1990s expanded into Europe. In January 1999, Cornstein left Finlay as acting chief executive. He was appointed to the New York Off-Track Betting Commission in 1994 and eventually became its chairman. He promoted ideas like televising races live and an 800 telephone number for gamblers to wager. Cornstein contemplated runs for Mayor of New York City in 1985 and 1991. He briefly declared himself a candidate for New York State Comptroller in 2001. Cornstein later dropped out of the race after Republicans leaders backed the eventual candidate, John Faso. In September 1999, he was named chairman of TeleHubLink, a telemarketing company that produced wireless encryption products. He had been a director of What A World! since July 1993, before it changed its name to TeleHub. His connection with TeleHubLink proved problematic when, in April 2001, Attorney General of New York Eliot Spitzer filed a lawsuit against TeleHubLink for violating consumer protection laws. The State argued: > Using the name Triple Gold Benefits, Telehublink Inc.'s telemarketers > promised thousands of consumers across the nation that, for an advance fee > of over $200, the consumers would receive a low rate, general purpose Visa > or MasterCard credit card. In fact, consumers who paid the advance fee did > not receive a credit card. Instead, Telehublink sent them a 'discount > benefits package' consisting of generally worthless items such as an > application for a credit card. In January 2003, the Third Department of the New York State Supreme Court, Appellate Division, upheld a 2001 ruling that \\"had halted the scam and awarded restitution to victimized consumers.\\" Cornstein was previously the chairman of Pinnacle Advisors Ltd., in addition to being CEO, president, and chairman emeritus of Finlay Enterprises. In 2006, Cornstein was elected chairman of the board of the Jewelers' Security Alliance. New York Governor George Pataki gave Cornstein the chairmanship of the New York State Olympic Games Commission as it prepared a bid for the 2012 games, which eventually went to London. = U.S. Ambassador to Hungary = A life-long Republican, Cornstein has been a frequent contributor to Republican politicians, although he has also donated to the campaigns of Chuck Schumer and Cory Booker. On February 13, 2018, United States President Donald Trump nominated Cornstein to be U.S. Ambassador to Hungary. Cornstein was a long-time friend of Trump's. He was a member of Trump's golf club in West Palm Beach. As Ambassador, Cornstein vocally defended the Orb√°n government. According to The Washington Post, Cornstein sought to \\"charm\\" rather than shame Viktor Orb√°n. Under Orb√°n's premiership, Hungary underwent democratic backsliding, becoming increasingly authoritarian. Cornstein told Hungarian media that he had seen no evidence of this authoritarian shift, but according to The Washington Post there was \\"mounting evidence\\" of government infringements on human rights in Hungary. The Hungarian government and its defenders gleefully repeated Cornstein's remarks. In a 2019 interview with The Atlantic's Franklin Foer, Cornstein was asked about Orb√°n's own description of his administration as a \\"illiberal democracy\\", Cornstein said, \\"I can tell you, knowing [Trump] for a good 25 or 30 years, that he would love to have the situation that Viktor Orb√°n has, but he doesn‚Äôt.\\" In September 2018, Cornstein claimed that he had reached an agreement with Orb√°n that Central European University, a notable American university in Budapest, would be allowed to stay in Hungary. However, in December 2018, Central European University said it had been kicked out of Hungary in what The Washington Post described as a \\"a dark waypoint in Hungary‚Äôs crackdown on civil society and an ominous sign for U.S. institutions operating under autocratic regimes worldwide.\\" During the same week that Central European University was driven out of Hungary, Cornstein described Orb√°n as a \\"friend\\" and criticized George Soros, who founded the university. Cornstein stated that Soros had a crazed hatred of Orb√°n, which led CEU not to make concessions to stay in Hungary. Cornstein mocked the size of Central European University, said that the departure of CEU \\"doesn't have anything to do with academic freedom\\", and mused why \\"this has become such an important subject in the world\\". Asked by The Atlantic's Franklin Foer if US relations with Hungary would suffer as a result of the CEU ouster, Cornstein answered \\"not really.\\" When Cornstein gave his answer, his aide asked him to step out of the room; Cornstein told Foer, \\"I'm in trouble.\\" In October 2019, The New York Times published a story documenting controversies in Cornstein's tenure as U.S. Ambassador to Hungary, highlighting his close support of Orb√°n's policies and unchecked power, as well as extravagant spending on parties. On September 15, 2020, the U.S. Embassy in Budapest announced that Cornstein informed President Trump and Hungarian Foreign Minister P√©ter Szijj√°rt√≥ that he would end his service as U.S. Ambassador to Hungary effective November 1, 2020. In doing so, the ambassador said that ‚Äúit has been an honor and a privilege to serve the country that I love in a country that I have come to cherish.\\"  References  Further reading * Category:1938 births Category:Ambassadors of the United States to Hungary Category:Horace Mann School alumni Category:Lafayette College alumni Category:New York University alumni Category:Living people Category:New York (state) Republicans Category:Businesspeople from New York City Category:American jewellers Category:American people of Hungarian-Jewish descent Category:Jewish American government officials ","title":"David Cornstein"},{"id":"58056737","text":"Henry James Ten Eyck (July 25, 1856, Albany, N.Y. ‚Äì November 29, 1887, Albany) was an American journalist.

De Lapelin was promoted to Capitaine de fr√©gate (Frigate captain) on 18 December 1848. In 1851 he commanded one of the ships of the Pacific Ocean Naval Division (DNOP) in the South Pacific, and visited Rio de Janeiro. He published an account of his survey of the west coast of Central America in his Reconnaissance hydrographique des c√¥tes occidentales du Centre Am√©rique, ex√©cut√©e par la corvette la Brillante (1854). He participated in naval operations of the Crimean War (1853‚Äì1856). After the war de Lapelin again served in the Pacific and in the China Sea. He was promoted to Capitaine de vaisseau (Ship-of-the-line captain) on 30 July 1857. He was with Admiral L√©onard Charner when he arrived in Saigon, then capital of the French colony of Cochinchina, on 7 February 1861. Lapelin commanded 1,000 naval fusiliers in the relief of the Siege of Saigon. He was made a Commander of the Legion of Honour on 22 April 1861. De Lapelin was governor of Martinique from 15 July 1864 to January 1867.

In 1870 he succeeded Georges Charles Clou√© as commander of the Pacific Fleet. There were few French people in central Oceania at this time apart from Marist missionaries. Most trade was handled by Godeffroy, a German company, or by the English. In 1872 de Lapelin observed that, \\"It is through the Missions of central Oceania that the indigenes know France, because we do no business there, and our citizens, other than the missionary fathers and brothers, are extremely rare.\\" However, the French were engaged in a competition with the European powers and the United States to take control of as many islands as possible. In 1872 de Lapelin visited Easter Island ( l‚Äô√Æle de P√¢ques, now Rapa Nui) on the ship La Flore. Pierre Loti was a midshipman on the vessel. DeLapelin collected a beautifully carved Moai head from Cook Bay (Hanga Roa, now held in the Mus√©e du quai Branly. He gave an estimate in 1872 that the island had 175 inhabitants. The population had been much higher but had been devastated by smallpox, and some of the men had been taken to Peru as slaves. Five year later Alphonse Pinart estimated that there were just 110 inhabitants. De Lapelin was made a Grand Officer of the Legion of Honour on 5 March 1874. The decoration was presented on 27 April 1874 by Vice-Admiral Charles de Dompierre d'Hornoy, Minister of the Navy.. He died on 12 January 1888 at the age of 75.

Their popularity in China was directly related to the supply of silver: historically, silver was a rare metal in China. However, imports from Japan and Spanish America (through the Manilla galleons) during the Ming dynasty allowed the charm's popularity to grow. Traditionally, lock charms could be bought from silversmiths in various shapes and sizes. Parents would often let a Buddhist or a Taoist priest use their own hands to tie these lock charms to their young sons. Wealthy families often gave their sons lock charms made from jade, nephrite, silver, or gold. While poorer families often bought silver locks for their sons, it was also not uncommon for poorer families' sons to wear brass lock charms. In use, Chinese lock charms were very similar to Chinese fish charms which were also gifted by parents to their children for protection. Symbolism coin-shaped openings to deposit money in.

The origin of the name came from the Sherpa Climbing Club of Ellensburg, and is inspired by the obvious resemblance to its Himalayan namesake when comparing the south faces of both.Beckey, Fred W. Cascade Alpine Guide, Climbing and High Routes. Seattle, WA: Mountaineers Books, 2008.Barnes, Nathan and Jeremy, Alpine Lakes Wilderness: The Complete Hiking Guide, Mountaineers Books. 2019. Little Annapurna is part of The Enchantments within the Alpine Lakes Wilderness, and is set on land managed by Okanogan-Wenatchee National Forest. It belongs to the Stuart Range which is subset of the Cascade Range. Little Annapurna is situated southeast of Dragontail Peak, which is its nearest higher neighbor. Remnants of the receding Snow Creek Glacier can be found on its gentle north slope. Precipitation runoff drains into tributaries of the Wenatchee River. Climate Most weather fronts originate in the Pacific Ocean, and travel east toward the Cascade Mountains. As fronts approach, they are forced upward by the peaks of the Cascade Range, causing them to drop their moisture in the form of rain or snowfall onto the Cascades (Orographic lift). As a result, the Cascades experience high precipitation, especially during the winter months in the form of snowfall. During winter months, weather is usually cloudy, but, due to high pressure systems over the Pacific Ocean that intensify during summer months, there is often little or no cloud cover during the summer. Because of maritime influence, snow tends to be wet and heavy, resulting in high avalanche danger. Geology The Alpine Lakes Wilderness features some of the most rugged topography in the Cascade Range with craggy peaks and ridges, deep glacial valleys, and granite walls spotted with over 700 mountain lakes. Geological events occurring many years ago created the diverse topography and drastic elevation changes over the Cascade Range leading to the various climate differences. The history of the formation of the Cascade Mountains dates back millions of years ago to the late Eocene Epoch. With the North American Plate overriding the Pacific Plate, episodes of volcanic igneous activity persisted. In addition, small fragments of the oceanic and continental lithosphere called terranes created the North Cascades about 50 million years ago. During the Pleistocene period dating back over two million years ago, glaciation advancing and retreating repeatedly scoured the landscape leaving deposits of rock debris. The last glacial retreat in the Alpine Lakes area began about 14,000 years ago and was north of the Canada‚ÄìUS border by 10,000 years ago. The \\"U\\"-shaped cross section of the river valleys are a result of that recent glaciation. Uplift and faulting in combination with glaciation have been the dominant processes which have created the tall peaks and deep valleys of the Alpine Lakes Wilderness area.

His theories and findings have been superseded by more recent research, but his work has been an inspiration to such notable scientists as Robert Yerkes and John Peabody Harrington. Education Richard Lynch Garner was born in Abingdon, Virginia on February 19, 1848, the son of a businessman. He joined the Confederate Army at the age of 14, and during the Civil War was captured several times by Union soldiers. After the war, he attended the Jefferson Academy for Men in Tennessee for two years before becoming a schoolteacher, a vocation he pursued for over a decade. He married Maggie E. Gross on October 15, 1872 and they had one son. Career Garner's career studying primates arose through his interest in Charles Darwin and the theory of evolution. He hypothesized that human speech might have arisen from animal sounds and \\"resolved to study those sounds in a methodic manner and try to learn the speech of animals.\\" He acquired one of Thomas Edison's early phonographs and began to spend time observing and recording monkeys at zoos in Cincinnati, Chicago, Washington, D.C., and elsewhere. He became famous for an 1891 article, \\"The Simian Tongue\\", in which he argued that the lower primates have a rudimentary language, and that this language is the origin of human speech. Garner next raised funds for a trip to study chimpanzees in Gabon; among his donors were such prominent figures as Edison, Alexander Melville Bell, and Grover Cleveland. In Gabon, he attempted to decipher individual words of the chimpanzee language, and he also attempted to teach one chimpanzee a few words. He returned to Africa on several more research trips, some lasting more than a year. In 1910, he brought a chimpanzee named Susie back to the United States and toured with her, attempting to demonstrate that she knew a hundred English words. Garner published three books on the subject of speech in primates, as well as articles in various magazines. Garner was hospitalized with Bright's disease in Chattanooga, Tennessee, and died several days later, on January 22, 1920. Publications * The Speech of Monkeys (1892) * Gorillas & Chimpanzees (1896) * Apes and Monkeys: Their Life and Language (1900) * Autobiography of a Boy: From the Letters of Richard Lynch Garner (1930; posthumous) Legacy Early on, publications that did not reject evolutionary theory outright tended to accept Garner's various claims about chimpanzees ‚Äî that he could communicate with them in their language, that he had taught them English words, that within a few generations they would be entirely literate ‚Äî but in later years more skeptical and even satirical articles began to appear. Little of Garner's work has held up to scientific scrutiny, both because of his inflated claims and because he was a notoriously sloppy researcher who made many plainly incorrect statements about chimpanzee behavior (such as his assertion that their gestation period is 3 months when it is closer to 8 months). At the same time, he was ahead of his time in his pioneering use of recording devices for capturing field data and for use in playback-based experiments. And while he himself was not able to make a sound case for his intuitions about monkey speech, it has since been proven that monkeys do have a rudimentary language of their own, and that they can learn a vocabulary of a few hundred human words. As the primatologist Robert Yerkes later wrote: \\"The writer humbly confesses that the more he learns about the great apes and lesser primates by direct observation as contrasted with reading, the more facts and valuable suggestions he discovers in Garner's writings.\\" The ethnologist John Peabody Harrington considered Garner an inspiration and wrote a brief biography of Garner entitled He Spoke. Harrington also helped get Garner's papers and slides donated to the Smithsonian Institution. References Further reading * Harvey, Neil. \\"The Man Who Talked to Monkeys\\".

It has been a subsidiary of the Czech cybersecurity company Avast since 2016. History HMA was created in 2005 in Norfolk, England by Jack Cator. At the time, Cator was sixteen years-old. He created HMA in order to circumvent restrictions his school had on accessing games or music from their network. According to Cator, the first HMA service was created in just a few hours using open-source code. The first product was a free proxy website where users typed in a URL and it delivered the website in the user's browser. Cator promoted the tool in online forums and it was featured on the front page of Digg. After attracting more than one thousand users, Cator incorporated ads. HMA did not take any venture capital funding. It generated about $1,000 - $2,000 per month while the founder went to college to pursue a degree in computer science. In 2009, Cator dropped out of college to focus on HMA and added a paid VPN service. Most early HMA employees were freelancers found on oDesk.com. In 2012, one of the freelancers set-up a competing business. HMA responded by hiring its contractors as full-time employees and establishing physical offices in London. In 2012, the United Kingdom's government sent HMA a court order demanding it provide information about Cody Andrew Kretsinger's use of HMA's service to hack Sony as a member of the LulzSec hacking group. HMA provided the information to authorities. HMA said it was a violation of the company's terms of use to use its software for illegal activities. In 2013, HMA added software to anonymize internet traffic from mobile devices was first added in 2013. In 2014, the company introduced HideMyPhone! service, which allowed mobile phone users to make their calls appear to come from a different location. By 2014, the service had 10 million users and 215,000 paying subscribers of its VPN service. It made ¬£11 million in revenue that year. HMA had 100 staff and established international offices in Belgrade and Kiev. By 2015, HMA became one of the largest VPN providers. In May 2015, it was acquired by AVG Technologies for $40 million, and became part of Avast after its 2016 acquisition of AVG Technologies. In 2017, a security vulnerability was discovered that allowed hackers with access to a user's laptop to obtain elevated privileges on the device. In 2019, it was reported that HMA received a directive from Russian authorities to join a state sponsored registry of banned websites, which would prevent Russian HMA users from circumventing Russian state censorship. HMA was reportedly given one month to comply, or face blocking by Russian authorities. Software HMA provides digital software and services intended to help users remain anonymous online and encrypt their online traffic. Its software is used to access websites that may be blocked in the user's country, to anonymize information that could otherwise be used by hackers, and to do something unscrupulous without being identified. HMA's privacy policy and terms of use prohibit using it for illegal activity. HMA hides the user's IP address and other identifying information by routing the user's internet traffic through a remote server. However, experts note that the company does log some connection data including the originating IP address, the duration of each VPN session, and the amount of bandwidth used. As of May 2018, the company had 830 servers in 280 locations across the globe and provided over 3000 IP addresses. The software also includes a kill switch across all platforms. Privacy According to Invisibler, HMA VPN appears to have cooperated with US authorities in handing over logs in a hacking case. This led to the arrest of a hacker in what is known as the ‚ÄúLulzSec fiasco‚Äù. However, since May 2020, HMA claims to be a \\"no log VPN\\", stating they no longer collect any usage logs. Reception In 2015, a review in Tom's Hardware said HMA was easy to use, had good customer service, and a large number of server locations to choose from, but criticized it for slowing internet speeds. In contrast, Digital Trends said HMA had strong speeds and good server selection, but wasn't fool-proof at ensuring anonymity, because it stored user activity logs (in 2020, HMA announced that it would no longer log user activityhttps://proprivacy.com/vpn/privacy- news/hide-ass-hma-brand-vpn). In 2017, PC World noted that it was difficult to measure the effect a VPN service has on internet speed, because of variables like location, internet service speeds, and hardware. A 2016 review in PC Magazine gave the HMA Android app 3 out of 5 stars. It praised HMA for its server selection and user interface, but criticized it for price, speed, and the lack of advanced features. In 2018, PC Magazine gave similar feedback on the HMA VPN service. PC World‚Äôs 2017 review also praised HMA's simple user interface, but criticized the lack of advanced features, saying the software was ideal for casual users that do not need advanced configuration options.

On 28 February 1860 the 1st Lanarkshire RVC was expanded by the amalgamation of a number of the smaller RVCs that had sprung into existence in Glasgow, with Sir Archibald Campbell promoted to Lieutenant-Colonel Commandant on 6 March. In June 1860 it was divided into two battalions:Frederick, pp. 72‚Äì4.Beckett, p. 60; Appendix VII.Army List, various dates.1st Lanarkshire at Scottish Military Articles. 1st Battalion * No 1 Company ‚Äì from 1st (Glasgow 1st Western) Lanarkshire RVC * No 2 Company ‚Äì from 9th (Glasgow 1st Bankers) Lanarkshire RVC, recruited from members of the banking profession, with several of the banks subscribing towards the arms and equipment of the members, services accepted 10 October 1859 * No 3 Company ‚Äì from 11th (Glasgow 2nd Western) Lanarkshire RVC, services accepted 4 November 1859 * No 4 Company ‚Äì from 15th (Procurators) Lanarkshire RVC, formed after a meeting at the Faculty Hall on 23 September 1859 by members of the legal profession, services accepted 5 December 1859 * No 5 Company ‚Äì from 17th (Stockbrokers and Accountants) Lanarkshire RVC, recruited from men employed in stockbrokers' and accountants' offices with an initial financial contribution from the Glasgow Stock Exchange and the Glasgow Institute of Accountants and Actuaries, services accepted 5 December 1859 * No 6 Company ‚Äì from 33rd (1st Partick) Lanarkshire RVC, a self-supporting company recruited in the Partick Division of Glasgow, services accepted 22 December 1859 * No 7 Company ‚Äì from 39th Lanarkshire RVC, recruited from employees of shipping companies, services accepted 29 December 1859 * No 8 Company ‚Äì from 79th (Glasgow 3rd Western) Lanarkshire RVC, services accepted 29 March 1860 2nd Battalion * No 9 Company ‚Äì from 2nd (University of Glasgow) Lanarkshire RVC, recruited from professors, graduates and students of Glasgow University, services accepted 24 September 1859 * No 10 Company ‚Äì from 18th Lanarkshire RVC, recruited from employees of Messrs Wylie & Lochhead, a Glasgow firm of furnishers and undertakers, with Robert Downie Wylie as captain, John Wylie as lieutenant, and William Lochhead as ensign, services accepted 5 December 1859 * No 11 Company ‚Äì from 50th (1st Press Corps) Lanarkshire RVC, recruited from newspaper employees and pressmen, services accepted 10 January 1860 * No 12 Company ‚Äì from 53rd Lanarkshire RVC, recruited from employees of the warehousing, general wholesale and retail drapery firms and J & W Campbell Ltd, with a financial contribution from J.W. Campbell, services accepted 30 January 1860 * No 13 Company ‚Äì from 63rd Lanarkshire RVC, recruited from employees of the baking, grain and provisions trades, whose firms contributed financially, services accepted 22 February 1860, joined 1st Corps March 1860 * No 14 Company ‚Äì from 72nd (Fine Arts) Lanarkshire RVC, recruited from Glasgow jewellers, silversmiths, engravers, watch and clockmakers, services accepted 17 February 1860, joined 1st Corps March 1860 * No 15 Company ‚Äì from 76th (Port Dundas) Lanarkshire RVC, recruited from men working in the wharves, stores, distilleries, sawmills and sugar works at Port Dundas, services accepted 26 March 1860, joined 1st Corps April 1860 * No 16 Company ‚Äì from 77th (City Rifle Guard or 2nd University) Lanarkshire RVC ‚Äì had existed for a few months as a drill class at Glasgow University, but recruits were mainly from the mercantile community, services accepted 8 March 1860, joined 1st Corps in April 1860 The ranks of the 1st and 2nd Western Companies provided many officers for other RVCs. Henry Campbell- Bannerman, a future prime minister, served as lieutenant in the 53rd RVC, becoming captain in 1867; he was a nephew of the founder of J. & W Campbell and was a partner in the firm. After his death in 1866, Sir Archibald Campbell was succeeded as Lt-Col Commandant by his brother, Sir George Campbell, 4th Baronet, formerly a captain in the Royal Dragoons. In 1863 No 1 Company as disbanded and No 14 was absorbed into No 15. The following year No 7 Company was absorbed into No 3 and the companies were lettered, A to G for 1st Bn, K to Q (omitting O) for 2nd Bn. In 1870, K company, the old University Company, was absorbed into Q Company, the old 77th, which also had its origins in Glasgow University. New K and O Companies were added in 1878, K being relettered I and new H and K Companies being raised in 1881. The corps carried out its first drills on the Burnbank ground in Great Western Road, Glasgow, building a drill hall there in 1866‚Äì7. Later it built a new headquarters (HQ) at 261 West Princes Street. By 1881 the HQ was at 242 West George Street. Localisation Under the 'Localisation of Forces' scheme introduced in 1872 by the Cardwell reforms, the 1st Lanarkshire RVC was grouped with the 26th (Cameronian) Regiment of Foot, the 74th (Highland) Regiment of Foot, the 1st Royal Lanark Militia and a number of other Lanarkshire RVCs in Brigade No 59. When these were combined under the Childers Reforms of 1881, the 1st Lanarkshire RVC became the senior Volunteer Battalion of the new Cameronians (Scottish Rifles), without changing its title. The Stanhope Memorandum of December 1888 introduced a Mobilisation Scheme for Volunteer units, which would assemble in their own brigades at key points in case of war. In peacetime these brigades provided a structure for collective training.Beckett, pp. 135, 185‚Äì6.Dunlop, pp. 60‚Äì1; Appendix A.Spiers, pp. 228‚Äì9. Under this scheme the Lanarkshire battalions were included in the Clyde Brigade, later the Glasgow Brigade, based at 127 St Vincent Street, Glasgow, and later at Hamilton, South Lanarkshire. One hundred and two volunteers from the battalion served with the 1st and 2nd Volunteer Service Companies of the Scottish Rifles and with the Imperial Yeomanry in the Second Boer War, earning its first Battle honour: South Africa 1900‚Äì02.Leslie. In 1902 the Glasgow Brigade was split up, and the four Volunteer Battalions of the Cameronians became the Scottish Rifle Brigade. The High School of Glasgow Cadet Corps of two companies was formed that year and affiliated to the 1st Lanarkshires. Territorial Force When the Volunteers were subsumed into the new Territorial Force (TF) under the Haldane Reforms of 1908,Dunlop, Chapter 14.Spiers, Chapter 10. the battalion became the 5th Battalion, Cameronians (Scottish Rifles).London Gazette 20 March 1908. K Company (the University Company) became a contingent of the Senior Division of the Officers' Training Corps (OTC) and the High School Glasgow Cadet Corps joined the Junior Division of the OTC. The Scottish Rifles Brigade formed part of the Lowland Division of the TF.James, pp. 70‚Äì1.Thompson, pp. 3‚Äì5.Becke, Pt 2a, p. 111.52 (L) Division at Long, Long Trail. World War I =Mobilisation= The Lowland Division had been attending annual camp on the Ayrshire coast when the order to mobilise was received at 17.25 on Tuesday August 1914. On return from camp the 5th Scottish Rifles mobilised at 261 West Princes Street and then undertook guards and patrols at vulnerable points around Glasgow and the River Clyde. The division completed its mobilisation by 10 August and proceeded to its war stations in the Forth Defences, with the Scottish Rifles Bde at Falkirk and 5th Bn at Larbert. The troops were billeted in all manner of buildings.Scottish Rifles at Long, Long Trail. =Recruitment= On 10 August, units of the division were invited to volunteer for Overseas Service, and the majority did so. On 31 August, the War Office authorised the formation of a reserve or 2nd Line unit for each unit where 60 per cent or more of the men had volunteered for Overseas Service. The titles of these 2nd Line units would be the same as the 1st Line original, but distinguished by a '1/' or '2/' prefix. In this way duplicate battalions, brigades and divisions were created, mirroring those TF formations being sent overseas. Where recruitment was good, they also formed 3rd Line unitsBecke, Pt 2b, p. 6.Thompson, pp. 5‚Äì6. =1/5th Scottish Rifles = The First Line battalion was one of the first TF units selected to reinforce the Regulars of the British Expeditionary Force (BEF) in France and soon left the Lowland Division. It landed at Le Havre on 5 November 1914, joining 19th Brigade on 19 November. At this time 19th Bde (which included 1st Bn Cameronians) had just been relieved from the line following very heavy fighting in the Battle of Armenti√®res. Although an independent brigade, it was attached to 6th Division.Becke, Pt 1, p. 75.Edmonds, 1914, Vol II, pp. 227, 459; Appendices 1 & 5.Thompson, p. 6.6th Division at Long, Long Trail. After a winter of trench warfare, from 31 May 1915, 19th Bde was attached to 27th Division (another Regular formation that had suffered heavy casualties in the 2nd Battle of Ypres).Becke, Pt 1, p. 99.27th Division at Long, Long Trail. On 19 August 1915, 19th Bde transferred again to 2nd Division, this time as an integral part of the division.Becke, Pt 1, pp. 41‚Äì6.2nd Division at Long, Long Trail. 2nd Division was preparing for the forthcoming Battle of Loos. On 25 September it was to assault the enemy trenches south of the La Bass√©e Canal, preceded by a 40-minute discharge of poison gas. 19th Brigade's attack would be assisted by two mines blown under the German lines by 173rd Tunnelling Company, Royal Engineers. However, the mines were ordered to be blown 10 minutes before the brigade's attack, giving the German defenders plenty of time to prepare. Many of the attackers were also affected by the British gas cloud being blown back on them by the inconsistent winds. The leading battalions failed to get into the enemy position, and the attack was halted before 1/5th Scottish Rifles in reserve actually went 'over the top'.Cherry, pp. 25, 37, 47‚Äì8, 65‚Äì9, 75‚Äì6. On 25 November 1915, 19th Bde was transferred to 33rd Division, a 'Kitchener's Army' formation that had just arrived in France.Becke, Pt 3b, pp. 31‚Äì9.33rd Division at Long, Long Trail.Seton-Hutchinson, pp. 3‚Äì4. At the end of December the new division took over 2nd Division's section of the line at La Bass√©e, facing the intricate trench system around the canal, the 'Brickstacks' (a German strongpoint built into the stacks of the La Bass√©e brickworks), and the villages of Cuinchy and Cambrin. This was considered a quiet sector, but an excellent training ground in trench warfare, with continuous mining activity and occasional trench raids.Macarney-Filgate, pp. 11-6.Seton-Hutchinson, pp. 5‚Äì6. On 29 May 1916 the battalion merged with merged with 6th Scottish Rifles to form the 5th/6th Battalion. (6th Battalion had left the Lowland Division in March 1915 and served with a number of divisions in France, including a period as a pioneer battalion, before joining 100th Bde in 33rd Division.) =5th/6th Scottish Rifles= Somme After five months of familiarisation with trench warfare, 33rd Division saw its first fullscale operations during the Somme Offensive as part of XV Corps. It began to move south by train on 10 July and was in Corps Reserve during the Battle of Albert (12‚Äì13 July) before being committed to action during the Battle of Bazentin Ridge. XV Corps had taken most of its objectives on 14 July, but High Wood and Delville Wood remained in enemy hands. Next day, 19th Brigade remained in reserve while the rest of 33rd Division assaulted Switch Trench. This attack was a failure, the infantry returning to their starting positions. On the morning of 16 July 19th Bde relieved 100th Bde, and at dawn on 20 July it renewed the attack. 5th/6th Scottish Rifles were drawn up alongside 1st Cameronians just outside the British wire and attacked High Wood, preceded by a line of scouts and supported by Royal Engineers and divisional Pioneers. The attack began satisfactorily, prisoners being taken, but German machine gun nests inflicted serious casualties and the advance was held up. The brigade commander threw in his remaining troops and by the end of the day 19th Bde held the rest of the wood in its front. The Switch Line beyond was not finally captured until 27 September, and in the meantime the casualties suffered in holding the positions in High Wood under shellfire were heavy. 33rd Division was relieved from the line in early August, returning to High Wood for a new attack on 24 August for which 19th Bde was in reserve. The division was sent for rest at the end of September.Seton-Hutchison, pp. 16‚Äì21. The division returned to the Somme sector on 22 October to take part in a new series of attacks in the area of 'Dewdrop' and 'Boritska' Trenches. On 3‚Äì4 November 19th Brigade attacked 'Hazy' Trench and took the 'Gun Pits', even though heavy artillery could not be used in support because of the uncertainty of the exact positions of friendly and enemy troops. Supplies had to be manhandled to the front line across of thick mud. The division then took over a section of line from the French and garrisoned this during the winter.Seton-Hutchison, pp. 25‚Äì32. Arras In March 1917 33rd Division was withdrawn to train for the Arras offensive. After initial successes in early April, the BEF attempted to continue the advance towards the Hindenburg Line by raids and strong patrols. 19th Brigade was detached on 12 April to assist 21st Division in attacks on 13 and 15/16 April. These attacks were unsuccessful, but 19th Bde was firmly established in the forward part of the Hindenburg Line when the rest of 33rd Division took over the front. Casualties during the subsequent fighting were heavy.Seton-Hutchison, pp. 32‚Äì49. Third Ypres 33rd Division spent the summer on the Flanders coast defending the Nieuport sectorSeton-Hutchison, pp. 62‚Äì4. before being moved to the Ypres Salient in September to join in the Third Ypres Offensive. The division was due to attack at dawn on 26 September and moved into position during the night of 24/25 September, with 19th Bde in reserve, but it was itself heavily attacked on the morning of 25 September. Despite being driven from many positions and suffering severe casualties, the division was able to play some part in the patched-up attack (the Battle of Polygon Wood) the following day, recapturing its original line and establishing advanced posts in the first objective.John Lee, 'The British Divisions at Third Ypres', in Liddle, p. 220.Macartney-Filgate, pp. 121‚Äì4.Seton-Hutchison, pp. 67‚Äì75.Wolff, p. 199. The division was withdrawn from Polygon Wood for a short rest, then took over the defence of the Passchendaele Salient in November in the worst of Flanders mud. 5th/6th Scottish Rifles was particularly aggressive with its patrols during the winter, forcing the enemy to give up possession of the 'Gasometers'.Seton- Hutchison, pp. 75‚Äì9. Spring Offensive The German Spring Offensive opened on 21 March 1918, and 33rd Division was sent south as reinforcements, concentrating in the Arras area by 8 April. When the second phase of the offensive broke through further north (the Battle of the Lys) the division moved to cover the important transport hub of Hazebrouck. 19th Brigade took up positions covering the approaches to M√©teren, where patrols on 12 April found the Germans driving broken British units westwards. The line was held by machine gunners and groups of these stragglers, then at dusk the 5th/6th Scottish Rifles arrived to stabilise the front. The line held during 13 April, then the next day a gap appeared to the battalion's left, towards the eastern edge of Meteren. Once again, a defence line was restored, with the help of divisional machine gunners and a New Zealand entrenching battalion. This line was strengthened on 15 April with the help of Royal Engineers and divisional cyclists. 19th Brigade was relieved that night.Seton-Hutchison, pp. 85‚Äì96. The fighting was still going on when 33rd Division relieved French troops east of Dickebusch Lake on 6 May. It took over a line running to Scottish Wood and Ridge Wood, an area that had been in the rear area of the Ypres Salient, but was now the front line and was threatened by the Germans who had captured Mont Kemmel. The Germans began a bombardment of the position at 03.30 on 8 May followed by an attack at 07.30 that gained a lodgement in Ridge Wood. 19th Brigade came up at 10.00 to restore the position, and a second German attack was stopped. The divisional commander now ordered 5th/6th Scottish Rifles to recapture Ridge Wood. The battalion moved from the right of the division, behind Dickebusch Lake where it was screened by trees, and the CO, Lt-Col H.B. Spens, then carefully deployed and 'launched a most energetic counter-attack, carried out with outstanding valour and enterprise'.Macartney-Filgate, pp. 165‚Äì6.Seton-Hutchison, pp. 112‚Äì3. Hundred Days Offensive After the Battle of the Lys, 33rd Division spent several months in the Ypres sector before being relieved by US troops at the end of August and going for training. By the time it re-entered the line in the Cambrai sector the Allied Hundred Days Offensive was well under way. It was ordered to make a preparatory attack on the outer defences of the Hindenburg Line on 21 September. At dawn 19th Bde advanced on the right, but machine gunners of the German Alpenkorps inflicted heavy casualties on 5th/6th Scottish Rifles and other assaulting battalions and they were driven back. During the night, 5th/6th Scottish Rifles' second-in-command, Major C.C. Scott, led a successful surprise attack that seized 'Gloucester Road' trench and the troublesome 'Meath Post' strongpoint, and held on against counter-attacks until relieved.Seton-Hutchison, pp. 127‚Äì30. Having prepared the way for the Battle of St Quentin Canal (29 September), 33rd Division's role was simply to occupy ground from which the outflanked enemy were expected to retire. However, although the main attack was successful, the enemy facing the division did not budge until the following day, when patrols pushed forwards to the canal bank.Edmonds & Maxwell-Hyslop, pp. 116, 146.Seton-Hutchison, pp. 131‚Äì40. Clary mairie today. 33rd Division crossed the canal without opposition on 5 October. Ordered to pursue towards the River Selle on 8 October, 19th Brigade advanced without an artillery barrage, but accompanied by field artillery, machine guns, engineers and cavalry, capturing several German guns while 5th/6th Scottish Rifles cleared the village of Clary. The division covered 7 miles in the day. The Selle was the next major German defence line; 33rd Division closed up to it on 11 October and established bridgeheads.Edmonds & Maxwell- Hyslop, pp. 219‚Äì20, 249‚Äì51.Seton-Hutchison, pp. 138‚Äì.41 After a pause to prepare for a major offensive, the Battle of the Selle, 33rd Division crossed the river in strength on 22 October and launched its attack at 02.00 on 23 October, with 5th/6th Scottish Rifles leading 19th Bde on the left. The German defences consisted of a line of Rifle pits supported by machine guns, but the battalion overcame all resistance and reached the first objective by about 03.30. The barrage lifted at 03.52 for the next bound, and the battalion took the second objective by 07.00. The rest of the brigade then passed through to take the third objective against weak opposition, but were held up before the final objective. 19th Brigade, accompanied by Royal Engineers, continued the attack the following morning, reaching the outskirts of Englefontaine. On the night of 25 October this village was taken by a pincer movement, 19th Bde working round the high ground to its north.Edmonds & Maxwell-Hyslop, pp. 362‚Äì3, 376.Macartney-Filgate, p. 186.Seton-Hutchison, pp. 144‚Äì8. The BEF's last major attack of the war was the Battle of the Sambre. On 4 November, 33rd Division bivouacked in the For√™t de Mormal, then on 5 November it passed through the 37th Division to the attack, making rapid progress, despite the cratered roads and fallen trees. The division crossed the Sambre by raft bridges next day, and in the evening 19th Bde took up the pursuit, liberating Pot de Vin the following morning. By the end of 7 November the brigade had reached the Maubeuge‚ÄìAvesnes road, when the 38th (Welsh) Division took over the pursuit.Edmonds & Maxwell-Hyslop, pp. 496‚Äì7, 502‚Äì3, 508‚Äì9.Macartney- Filgate, pp. 190‚Äì1.Seton-Hutchison, pp. 150‚Äì2. When the Armistice with Germany came into effect at 11.00 on 11 November, 33rd Division was camped in the Sambre Valley near Leval. Although the final operations were successful, casualties had been heavy, and the division had also been badly affected by the Spanish flu pandemic. It moved back to Hornoy-le-Bourg, in the Somme area for the winter. Demobilisation got under way in January 1919, and the last cadres returned to the UK by the end of June.Edmonds & Maxwell-Hyslop, pp. 561.Macartney-Filgate, pp. 188, 196‚Äì7.Seton-Hutchison, pp. 153‚Äì6. 5th/6th Scottish Rifles was disembodied on 18 November 1919. =2/5th Scottish Rifles = The 2nd Line battalion was formed in Glasgow in September 1914. The 2nd Line Lowland Divisional and Brigade HQs began to form in January 1915, but it was some time before the various formations and units were assembled from their depots. Training was held up both by the lack of modern arms and equipment, and the need to supply reinforcement drafts to the 1st Line. By August, however, the division was substantially complete and stationed at Bridge of Allan with the 2nd Scottish Rifles Brigade at Cambusbarron, when they were officially numbered 65th (2nd Lowland) Division and 195th (2/1st Scottish Rifles) Brigade respectively.Becke Pt 2b, pp. 61‚Äì5.65 (2nd L) Division at Long, Long Trail. In November 1915 the 2/5th Scottish Rifles absorbed the 2/8th Battalion. At this time the infantry battalions in the 64th (2nd Highland) and 65th (2nd Lowland) Divisions were numbered sequentially, with 2/5th Scottish Rifles becoming No 17 Battalion. In January 1916 it had reverted to its previous designation, but had absorbed 2/7th Bn. In March 1916 the division moved to Essex and joined Southern Army (Home Forces), 195th Bde being quartered around Billericay and then from July at Terling. In January 1917 65th (2nd Lowland) Division moved to Ireland to relieve 59th (2nd North Midland) Division, which had been the first TF formation to serve in that country. At first 2/5th Bn was stationed at Moore Park (Fermoy), and a year later at Galway. The battalion was disbanded at Tralee on 15 May 1918. =3/5th Scottish Rifles= A 3rd Line or reserve battalion was formed at Glasgow in November 1914. On 8 April 1916 it was redesignated 5th Reserve Bn, Scottish Rifles, and on 1 September 1916, when it was at Catterick Camp in North Yorkshire, it absorbed the 6th, 7th and 8th Reserve Bns of the regiment and formed part of the Lowland Reserve Bde. Later it returned to Scotland, being stationed at Galashiels and Hawick. By December 1917 it was at Leven as part of the Forth Garrison. It was disbanded at Bridge of Allan on 31 December 1918. =15th Scottish Rifles= In 1915 the Home Service men of the 5th, 6th and 7th Scottish Rifles were combined into 10th Scottish Provisional Battalion, which joined the Scottish Provisional Brigade (later 1st Provisional Brigade) on 22 May. In April 1916 the 1st Provisional Bde moved from Scotland to Kent to take over coastal defence duties, with 10th Bn stationed at Deal. The same month the battalion absorbed the 12th Scottish Provisional Bn, formed from Home service men of the 4th and 5th Bns Kings Own Scottish Borderers. The Military Service Act 1916 swept away the Home/Foreign service distinction, and all TF soldiers became liable for overseas service, if medically fit. The Provisional Brigades thus became anomalous, and at the end of 1916 the remaining battalions were formed into numbered battalions of their parent units in new Mixed Brigades and Home Service Divisions. 10th Provisional Bn became 15th Bn Scottish Rifles on 1 January 1917, while 1st Provisional Brigade became 221st Infantry Brigade (later 221st Mixed Brigade). Part of the role of these home defence units alongside the Training Reserve was physical conditioning to render men fit for drafting overseas. 15th Scottish Rifles continued in this role until the end of the war, and was disbanded on 30 July 1919.Army Council Instruction 221 of January 1916 (Appendix 18).Army Council Instruction 2364 of December 1916 (Appendix 204).David Porter's work on Provisional Brigades at Great War Forum.HQ 221 Mixed Brigade War Diary 4 August 1914 ‚Äì 30 July 1919, The National Archives (TNA), Kew, file WO 95/5458. Interwar The TF was reconstituted on 7 February 1920 when the 5th Cameronians reformed at Princes Street, with Lt-Col H.B. Spens, DSO in command. In 1921 the TF was reorganised as the Territorial Army (TA). In that year the 5th Bn absorbed the 8th Cameronians, becoming 5th/8th Battalion The Cameronians (Scottish Rifles). The battalion formed part of 156th (West Scottish) Bde of 52nd (Lowland) Division. It also had afflated to it 5th The Cameronians (Scottish Rifles) Cadet Battalion.Titles and designations, 1927. =Anti-Aircraft conversion= 90 cm 'Projector Anti- Aircraft', displayed at Fort Nelson, Hampshire. During the 1930s the increasing need for anti-aircraft (AA) defence for Britain's cities was addressed by converting a number of TA infantry battalions into AA units. The 5th/8th Cameronians was one of the battalions selected, becoming a Royal Artillery searchlight (S/L) regiment in late 1938 while remaining affiliated with the Cameronians. At the same time, the TA was doubled in size following the Munich Crisis, so two regiments were formed:Frederick, pp. 860‚Äì1, 869‚Äì70.Monthly Army List, January 1939.Litchfield, pp. 290‚Äì1. * 5th Bn Cameronians (Scottish Rifles) (56th Searchlight Regiment) ** 417‚Äì420 Searchlight Batteries * 8th Bn Cameronians (Scottish Rifles) (57th Searchlight Regiment) ** 421‚Äì424 Searchlight Batteries Thus the 8th Bn (57th S/L Rgt) once more had its own identity and history. In the event, only three batteries were formed in 5th Bn (56th S/L Rgt) at 261 West Prince's St (HQ, 419, 418 and 419 Btys), 420 being formed in 57th S/L Rgt.AA Command 3 September 1939 at Patriot Files. World War II =Mobilisation= The regiment formed part of 3 AA Division covering Scotland. In February 1939 the existing AA defences came under the control of a new Anti-Aircraft Command. In June a partial mobilisation of TA units was begun in a process known as 'couverture', whereby each AA unit did a month's tour of duty in rotation to man selected AA and searchlight positions. On 24 August, ahead of the declaration of war, AA Command was fully mobilised at its war stations.Routledge, pp. 65‚Äì6, 371. 5th Cameronians (56th S/L Rgt) became part of 52nd Light Anti-Aircraft Brigade, which was formed in August 1939 with responsibility for all of 3 AA Division's S/L provision.Routledge, Table LX, p. 378. =56th (5th Battalion, Cameronian Scottish Rifles) Searchlight Regiment= 3 AA Divisional sign. During the Phoney War period there were a number of attacks on the naval bases of Scotland before the Luftwaffe turned its attention to the campaigns in Norway and France and the Low Countries.Routledge, pp. 375‚Äì6. In August 1940 the RA took over all the S/L regiments in AA Command, after which the regiment was designated 56th (5th Battalion, Cameronian Scottish Rifles) Searchlight Regiment, RA.Farndale, Annex M.56 S/L Rgt at RA 39‚Äì45. The regiment supplied a cadre of experienced officers and men to 235th S/L Training Rgt at Ayr where it provided the basis for a new 531 S/L Bty formed on 14 November 1940. This battery later joined 52nd (Queen's Edinburgh, Royal Scots) S/L Rgt. Eastern Scotland largely escaped air attack during the Battle of Britain. In November 1940, at the height of The Blitz, a new 12 AA Division was formed to take over responsibility for western Scotland (including Glasgow and the Clyde) while 3 AA Division (including 52 AA Bde and 56th S/L Rgt) retained responsibility for eastern Scotland.Pile's despatch. This was still the situation on 11 February 1941 when the newly-formed 535 S/L Bty joined the regiment.Routledge, Table LXV, p. 396.Order of Battle of Non-Field Force Units in the United Kingdom, Part 27: AA Command, 12 May 1941, TNA file WO 212/79.

On 18 February 56th S/L Rgt was converted to the LAA role as 125th (Cameronians) LAA Rgt:Frederick, pp. 806, 839.125 LAA Rgt at RA 39‚Äì45Routledge, p. 400. * 414 LAA Bty from 357 S/L Bty * 417 LAA Bty from 417 S/L Bty * 418 LAA Bty from 418 S/L Bty * 419 LAA Bty from 419 S/L Bty By the middle of June the regiment had completed its conversion and was assigned to 6 AA Bde in 6 AA Division (later 2 AA Group) in South East England. 414 LAA Bty left the regiment on 3 October and joined 144th LAA Rgt based in Northern Ireland.Order of Battle of Non-Field Force Units in the United Kingdom, Part 27: AA Command, 1 October 1942, with amendments, TNA file WO 212/82. 125th (Cameronians) LAA Rgt transferred within 2 AA Gp to 27 (Home Counties) AA Bde in December 1942. However, in the spring of 1943, 125th LAA became an unbrigaded regiment, later leaving AA Command entirely and joining 76 AA Bde, one of the formations under 21st Army Group earmarked for the planned invasion of Normandy (Operation Overlord).Order of Battle of Non-Field Force Units in the United Kingdom, Part 27: AA Command, 13 March 1943, with amendments, TNA file WO 212/83.76 AA Bde War Diary, 1943, TNA file WO 166/11247.Order of Battle of the Forces in the United Kingdom, Part 2: 21 Army Group, 24 July 1943, with amendments, TNA file WO 212/238. The regiment with its three batteries, now designated a mobile unit, was at Toft Hall in Cheshire on 1 June 1943 when it came under the command of 76 AA Bde and began training for Overlord. During the summer months, it took part in various exercises on the South Coast of England, including practices with landing craft. In January 1944, 76 AA Bde moved to Essex, with 125th LAA Rgt established at Southend-on-Sea by the end of the month. Intensive training by units continued at firing camps and exercises around the country. By now the brigade had been joined by the lorries of 323rd Company Royal Army Service Corps (RASC) to provide mobility, with 1617 LAA Rgt Platoon assigned to 125th LAA Rgt.76 AA Bde War Diary, 1944, TNA file WO 171/1084. The standard organisation for a mobile LAA regiment in the forthcoming campaign would be three batteries (54 guns) equipped with towed or Self-Propelled (SP) Bofors 40 mm guns.Routledge, p. 306. Normandy Bofors gun and crew, summer 1944 In May, those units required for the assault phase of Overlord began to gather in southern England and concentrated at Southend. Elements of 76 AA Bde landed on D-Day (6 June) itself, and follow-up units arrived over following days. 76 AA Brigade's role was to defend Gold Beach, the Mulberry Harbour being constructed at Arromanches, and the little harbour of Port-en-Bessin. RHQ of 125th LAA Rgt under Lt-Col J.S Gow landed in Normandy on the evening of 9 June and the reconnaissance party of 417 S/L Bty arrived the following day. The battery was ready for action at Arromanches by 13 June, followed by the other two batteries on 15 June (418 at Huppain, 419 at Escures). There were a number of night engagements of Luftwaffe bombers, but daylight activity was restricted to attacks by a few single-engined Fighter-bombers. The regiment's Z Group of rear-echelon troops arrived from England on 18 July, and the RASC lorries began to arrive on 22 July.Routledge, Table XLIX, p. 319. Following the Battle of Falaise, 21st Army Group began its break-out from the Normandy beachhead. On 27 August 419 LAA Bty handed over its towed Bofors guns to 73rd and 120th LAA Rgts, and received SP Bofors in exchange, ready to follow the advancing army. On 1 September it transferred to the operational command of 80 AA Bde, which moved up to cover the crossing of the Seine. Two batteries deployed to cover the bridging operations at Mantes-Gassicourt and one to Vernon; later it moved to the crossing at Les Andelys.80 AA Bde War Diary, 1944, TNA file WO 171/1085.Routledge, Table L, p. 327. On 11 September the regiment returned to 76 AA Bde, which was in the Amiens area and scheduled to move up to cover the vital port of Antwerp, but this move was cancelled and the brigade went instead to join the siege of Boulogne (Operation Wellhit). It was withdrawn from Amiens on 22 September and reached Boulogne the following day, just as the siege ended.Routledge, Table LI, pp. 328‚Äì9. On 19 October the regiment joined 107 AA Bde, which was supporting the Siege of Dunkirk, using HAA and LAA guns against ground targets, as well as against Luftwaffe aircraft attempting to drop supplies to the besieged garrison.Routledge, pp. 323‚Äì4; Table LII, p. 331. Antwerp SP Bofors gun in Holland, December 1944. The regiment was withdrawn from Dunkirk on 1 November and moved to rejoin 76 AA Bde defending Antwerp. A Gun Defence Area (GDA) covering the whole area of Antwerp and the Scheldt estuary was established, with 76 AA Bde responsible for the 'Scheldt North' sector. HAA positions were established at intervals of 4‚Äì5000 yards along the waterway, interspersed with irregularly sited LAA positions. 125th LAA Regiment was fully deployed by 4 November, with RHQ and the Royal Electrical and Mechanical Engineers (REME) workshop in the convent at Hoogerheide (later at Kapelle), 417 LAA Bty at Krabbendijke, 419 LAA Bty at Rilland Cloisters, and 418 LAA Bty in the countryside. 2nd S/L Rgt arrived on 17 November with the primary task of cooperating with the LAA guns against mine-laying in the channel. Lieutenant-Colonel Gow acted as brigade commander on occasions when the brigadier was absent. 125th LAA Regiment contributed personnel to a local warning radar troop that 76 AA Bde organised from its own resourcesRoutledge, p. 335; Table LII, p. 331; Map 30. The only enemy aircraft seen in this period were on reconnaissance missions, usually flying very high. However, at the beginning of December 417 LAA battery was ordered to send A Trp to 4th Commando Brigade to defend the island of North Beveland against enemy shipping; C Trp joined it in early January 1945. When the German Army launched its Ardennes offensive (the Battle of the Bulge) aimed at breaking through to Antwerp, 76th AA Bde was ordered to take precautions against possible attacks by German airborne troops, as well as dealing with increased air activity; the night of 26/27 December was the busiest since the brigade arrived at the Scheldt. On 1 January 1945, the Luftwaffe launched Operation Bodenplatte: daylight attacks against Allied airfields in support of the Ardennes offensive. Between 09.20 and 09.54 some 50‚Äì60 enemy aircraft, mainly Messerschmitt Bf 109 and Focke-Wulf Fw 190, came over 76th AA Bde's area. Its war diary records: 'This was the best day since our formation', with 15 aircraft claimed as 'certainly destroyed' and others probably crashed in enemy territory.76 AA Bde War Diary, January‚ÄìJuly 1945, TNA file WO 171/4889.Routledge, pp. 346‚Äì7. Antwerp was heavily attacked by V-1 flying bombs; on 26 February one of these landed in 417 LAA Bty's area, causing a number of casualties. As the war in Europe drew to its close, AA commitments in rear areas were reduced and units closed up to the Scheldt, where they were either sent forward into Germany (as AA or occupation troops) or prepared for disbandment. Several regiments were disbanded in April 1945, other were converted into garrison troops or driver training regiments. 125th LAA Rgt remained in 76th AA Bde's order of battle in the final weeks of the war.Routledge, p. 348; Table LVII, p. 366. The brigade was ordered to cease fire on 3 May 1945 when a local truce came into effect to allow supplies to be sent to civilians in enemy-occupied Holland (Operation Manna). This was followed on 4 May by the German surrender at L√ºneburg Heath and the end of the war in Europe (VE Day). Occupation duties After VE Day, the brigade remained temporarily on its AA tasks. Its units then returned to the mainland from the Scheldt islands and concentrated north of Antwerp before moving into Germany in June to garrison the Dortmund‚ÄìBochum area.Routledge, p. 363. The units under command during this period included 125th LAA Rgt By October the brigade had established its HQ at Burgsteinfurt Schloss under the command of 52nd (L) Division in British Army of the Rhine. As well as guarding vital points, it was responsible for camps containing 6000 disarmed former Wehrmacht soldiers and 9000 Displaced persons (DPs).76 AA Bde War Diary, August‚ÄìDecember 1945, TNA file WO 171/4890. As the year progressed, units were progressively disbanded as the troops were demobilised. 125th (Cameronians) LAA Rgt was placed in suspended animation on 1 March 1946, completed on 9 April.<ref name = WD45A/>76 AA Bde War Diary, January‚ÄìJuly 1946, TNA file WO 171/8878. Postwar AA Command's formation sign. When the TA was reconstituted on 1 January 1947, the regiment reformed at Glasgow as 591st LAA Rgt (Cameronians). It formed part of 77 AA Bde (the wartime 51st LAA Bde) at Glasgow. On 16 March 1949 the regiment became 591st (Mixed) LAA/SL Rgt (Cameronians) ('Mixed' indicating that members of the Women's Royal Army Corps were integrated into the unit). On 1 June 1950 it absorbed 518th LAA/SL Rgt (the prewar 18th LAA Rgt formed at Glasgow in 1938) without change of title. On 1 October 1953 it dropped the S/L part of its title once more.Frederick, p. 1025.Litchfield, p. 292; Appendix 5.Watson, TA 1947.67‚Äì106 AA Bdes at British Army 1945 on. AA Command was disbanded on 10 March 1955 and there were wholesale amalgamations amongst its units. 591st (Cameronians) LAA Rgt amalgamated with 474th (City of Glasgow) HAA Rgt and 483rd (Blythswood) HAA Rgt to form 445th (Cameronians) LAA Rgt with the following organisation:Frederick, p. 1014.444‚Äì473 Rgts RA at British Army 1945 on. * P (Cameronians) Bty * Q (Blythswood) Bty * R (Glasgow) Bty (474th HAA Rgt had previously absorbed 592nd (Glasgow) LAA Rgt, descended from 8th Bn Cameronians.)

When the TA was reduced into the Territorial and Army Volunteer Reserve in 1967, the regiment was disbanded and became concurrently part of 207 (Scottish) Bty in 102 (Ulster and Scottish) LAD Rgt, and T (Glasgow) Bty in the Lowland Rgt, RA (Territorials).Frederick, pp. 1039, 1043.RA Volunteer Regiments. Uniform and Insignia The various companies that were raised in 1859‚Äì60 had variations on Volunteer grey uniforms. However, after a vote in 1862 they all adopted 'Elcho grey' (Hodden grey) with blue facings, the blue collar and cuffs laced in grey with an Austrian knot on the sleeve, and blue piping on the trousers. The soft grey peaked cap had a diced blue-and-white band and a silver bugle badge. Yellow leggings were worn. From 1872 to 1876 a grey busby was adopted, but the grey cap was reintroduced until 1878 when a grey helmet with bronze fittings came into use. In 1902 a drab service dress with green Austrian knot and field grey cap was adopted. This was retained until the early 20th Century when it adopted the Rifle green uniform with dark green facings of the Scottish Rifles. Honorary Colonel The following served as Honorary Colonel of the battalion: * Sir James Bell, 1st Baronet, former Provost of Glasgow, appointed 7 October 1893 * J.A.

It is the first missionary diocese of CANA launched by the Church of Nigeria in the United States and Canada, working as an evangelical, church planting movement. History The Church of Nigeria started within the Convocation of Anglicans in North America (CANA) in 2005 with the purpose of providing a home for orthodox and charismatic Anglicanism. CANA ministers have proclaimed a more charismatic worship style than has been typical in Episcopal churches. CANA became one of the founding jurisdictions of ACNA in June 2009. In 2010, CANA divided into several districts, including the Missionary District of the Trinity. Martyn Minns, Missionary Bishop of CANA at the time, presented to the General Synod of the Church of Nigeria that the Missionary District of the Trinity should become the Missionary Diocese of the Trinity, which was affirmed on September 23, 2011. The inauguration of the diocese took place on August 19, 2012 at the Anglican Church of the Resurrection in Indianapolis, Indiana. Present were Nicholas Okoh, Primate of Nigeria, and Robert Duncan, Primate of the ACNA. The diocese was later renamed the Anglican Diocese of the Trinity. In 2014, Julian Dobbs was named the Missionary Bishop of CANA. Archbishop Okoh affirmed that the ADOTT was a CANA diocese and thus part of the ACNA without direct relation to Nigeria. He directed that the constitution and canons of ADOTT be brought into conformity with the ACNA. The ACNA and the Church of Nigeria signed an agreement that stated that the three dioceses that have resulted from the Convocation of Anglicans in North America activity in the United States, could decide their own filiation in any of both churches, on 12 March 2019. This agreement was the result of the election of four suffragan bishops for the Missionary Diocese of the Trinity, composed mostly of Nigerian expatriates in the United States, by the Church of Nigeria, without the consultation of the ACNA College of Bishops. Until then all the three dioceses were members of both churches.Church of Nigeria, Anglican Church in North America Reach Agreement on CANA Dioceses, ACNA Official Website The Missionary Diocese of CANA East announced on 21 May 2019 their decision to withdrew membership in the Church of Nigeria to become solely a diocese of the Anglican Church in North America, with the name of Anglican Diocese of the Living Word.CANA East withdraws from the Church of Nigeria, Anglican Ink, 21 May 2019 The Missionary Diocese of CANA West also announced their withdrawal from ACNA to become a diocese of the Church of Nigeria on 23 May 2019, followed by the Missionary Diocese of the Trinity on the same day.

His father was a naval officer of the National Government. Sun joined the Navy in his early years. Career He was a professor of Physics at Shandong University in Jinan from 1982 until 1994 when he retired.  Activism Sun has a history of criticizing the Chinese government, being one of the original signatories of Charter 08 and has been harassed for relations with critics of Communist China. On April 5, 2009, Sun and a university student left to go to a local cemetery called Heroes‚Äô Mountain (Yingxiong Shan; Ëã±ÈõÑÂ±±) on a holiday to honor the dead. He was to visit the grave of Zhao Ziyang, a former Chinese Premier and Communist Party general secretary who died in 2005. When Sun entered the cemetery in Jinan, four or five men attacked him and beat him severely. He was admitted shortly after to Jinan hospital with three broken ribs and injuries to his spine, head, back, arms and legs. Later in 2010, Sun's passport application was rejected shortly before the Nobel Peace Prize ceremony for Liu Xiaobo.

It was founded in 1975 by Marilyn Richman, a drama therapist and co-founder of the North American Drama Therapy Association (NADTA), as a division of the Music Institute of Chicago, with the help of Frank Little, the director at the time. In 2015, the ITA's 40th anniversary, ITA became its own independent non-profit organization. ITA provides therapeutical services in art, drama, dance/movement and music therapy. Currently, ITA has three locations in Evanston, Highland Park and Chicago.  History  The Institute for Therapy through the Arts was founded in 1975 by drama therapist Marilyn Richman as a division of the Music Institute of Chicago in an effort to make the arts accessible to all students, despite possible developmental or physical challenges.  Annual Integrated Creative Arts Therapy Conference  Since 2016, ITA has hosted an annual creative arts therapy conference. The two-day conference consists of lectures, workshops and presentations. It is a meeting place for creative arts therapists to exchange ideas and research as well as an opportunity for professionals outside the field to learn about creative arts therapy.  Musical Bridges to Memory  The ‚ÄúMusical Bridges to Memory\\" (MBM) program is a recent study that ITA took part in on how dementia and music relate to each other. This study was prepared and conducted by a research team of the Northwestern University under leadership of Dr. Bonakdarpour, MD, from the Feinberg School of Medicine and ITA in partnership with the Silverado Memory Care center in Morton Grove, IL as well as professional musicians.  Music Therapy Social Skills Assessment and Documentation Manual  In 2014, ITA music therapists published the \\"Music Therapy Social Skills Assessment and Documentation Manual\\" (MTSSA). The MTSSA is a comprehensive manual designed for music therapists providing a structured assessment and documentation method for measuring social interaction, affect and engagement in a musical setting with children and adolescents who have neurodevelopmental disorders. The MTSSA was born out of the need to be able to address individualized goals for each group members and to accurately track progress in group music therapy sessions. Furthermore, it measures the generalization of progress made in music therapy session to other environments.
