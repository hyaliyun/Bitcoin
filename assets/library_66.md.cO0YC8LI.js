Smith's work examines how Heritage is mobilised within communities and informs individual and collective identities. Smith has explored the intersections between Gender and Heritage through Feminist critique in multiple publications.  Education  Smith completed a Bachelor of Arts with Honors, and continued her education to receive both a Doctorate of Philosophy from the University of Sydney and a Graduate Diploma in Higher Education from the University New South Wales.  Career  Originally from Sydney Australia, Smith taught Heritage and Archaeology at Charles Sturt University (1990‚Äì1995) and Indigenous studies and Heritage Studies at the University of New South Wales (1995‚Äì2000). She directed the Masters program in Cultural Heritage Management at the University of York, UK before arriving at the Australian National University in Canberra, Australia where she works today. She serves there as the Head of the Center for Heritage and Museum Studies. She is the editor of the International Journal of Heritage Studies and co-editor of the Key Issues in Cultural Heritage alongside William Logan.  Research  Among Smith's publications that examine the politics of heritage, most notable is her book Uses of Heritage. It examined case studies of communities including the Waanyi Aboriginal people of northern Queensland and British citizens in West Yorkshire, England. She explored links between material culture and identity. Her work suggests that people are more mindful and active in their use of heritage than previously assumed by scholars. Smith's more recent work researches the memories and identity conceptualizations of museum and heritage site visitors. This is published in the book Emotional Heritage: Visitor Engagement at Museums and Heritage Sites.  Awards  Smith was elected Fellow of the Academy of the Social Sciences in Australia in 2016.

Dobres explores these concepts in her book Technology and Social Agency: Outlining a Practice Framework for Archaeology.

In 1941 McColvin was appointed by The Library Association to undertake an exhaustive survey of the libraries of Great Britain. He was instructed to inquire into the immediate wartime problems being experienced by libraries and into possible postwar developments. After a tour of all the libraries up and down the country, he submitted his report on 9 September 1942.

From July 1945, as evacuated stock and archives returned to Westminster, McColvin established a children's section in Drury Lane and the Westminster History Collection of \\"archives, books, prints, maps and other materials\\".

Born in British Tanganyika to a white father and black mother, he enlisted in the King's African Rifles in 1957 after finishing school. He eventually achieved the rank of sergeant and, following Tanganyika's independence, was transferred to the Tanganyika Rifles. In April 1963 he became a lieutenant. He was later promoted to major and held command of a camp in Mafinga. During the Uganda‚ÄìTanzania War of 1978 and 1979 Walden served as commander of the 207th Brigade in the Tanzania People's Defence Force with the rank of brigadier. In 1981 he organised the withdrawal of the Tanzanian troops in Uganda. By 1987 he had been promoted to major general and two years later he oversaw an anti-poaching operation. He died in 2002.  Early life  John Butler Walden was born on 12 December 1939 to a white father, Stanley Arthur Walden, and a black mother, Violet Nambela in Tunduru, Tanganyika. Stanley Walden worked in the British colonial administration as Tunduru District Commissioner. In 1941 John Walden moved with his maternal grandmother to Mbeya. The following year his father was reassigned to a post in Njombe, Iringa, and Walden subsequently moved there. In 1945 he enrolled in Tosamanganga School, a Christian boarding school in Iringa which hosted many mixed-race students. His father secretly paid for his school fees. He spoke little with his parents while attending the institution, though the staff took a personal liking to him and his younger brother, Paul. He completed primary studies in 1952 and graduated in 1956 after completing the tenth grade, the most senior grade offered.  Military career  In 1957 Walden saw a recruitment advertisement for the King's African Rifles (KAR), and, forgoing his original wish to join the navy, decided to enlist at Colito Barracks in Dar es Salaam. He enjoyed military life and saw his service as an opportunity for adventure. Due to a shortage of administrative staff in the training section, he worked as a clerk for several months before beginning formal military instruction in July. In February 1958 he completed his training and was assigned to A Company, 6th Battalion KAR at Colito. Around two months later he was promoted to lance corporal. In early 1958 Walden was sent to Nakuru for instruction in storekeeping. After completing it he returned to Colito, though his company had already been posted to Mauritius for routine garrison duties. The following year he joined his unit there, and served as a storekeeper, performed administrative duties, and acted as a translator for the sub-area commander. In 1960 a cyclone struck the island and Walden was given charge of co-ordinating the distribution of disaster relief supplies with the Red Cross. Afterwards, A Company returned to Dar es Salaam, staying there for one or two months before being moved to Shinyanga. In December 1961 Tanganyika became a sovereign state and the 6th Battalion KAR were transferred to the newly formed Tanganyika Rifles. In 1962 Walden was made a sergeant and became his company's quartermaster. With the assistance of his unit's commander, he was able to take multiple specialised training courses. In late 1962 he was enrolled in Mons Officer Cadet School. He graduated in April 1963 as a lieutenant and was given command of a platoon in B Company, 1st Tanganyika Rifles at Colito. Walden later chose \\"Black Mamba\\"‚Äîthe name of a venomous snake‚Äîas his nom de guerre. He was a skilled marksman. In the late 1960s he held various responsibilities, including command of a Tanzania National Service camp in Mafinga, Iringa while holding the rank of major. Shortly after Mozambique obtained independence in 1975, Walden was sent there to serve as a military attach√©. During the Uganda‚ÄìTanzania War Walden served as commander of the 207th Brigade in the Tanzania People's Defence Force (TPDF) with the rank of brigadier. Ugandan forces occupied territory in northern Tanzania in late 1978, and during the TPDF's counter-attack Walden and his men recaptured Minziro and a sugar plantation. In early 1979 the TPDF invaded Uganda. The 207th Brigade was tasked with eliminating the Ugandan garrison at Katera. Walden ordered his troops to advance down a flooded path through a swamp to attack the town without being threatened by Ugandan troops. He accompanied his unit on the 50-hour trek. The brigade moved single-file through deep water and briefly lost contact with the local TPDF headquarters when its radios were rendered inoperative by the wet conditions. However, it were able to reach its destination and seize Katera after driving out the Ugandans with artillery fire. The unit was thereafter dubbed \\"the Amphibious Brigade\\" by Tanzanian soldiers. On 24 February Walden and his brigade participated in the capture of Masaka. On 10 April the TPDF attacked Kampala. The 207th Brigade advanced into the western portion of the city, and Walden oversaw the capture of President Idi Amin's residence. After the battle, his brigade was tasked with occupying the entirety of Kampala and maintaining order. In June 1981 he organised the withdrawal of all TPDF troops from Uganda. In 1985 Julius Nyerere, the President of Tanzania, resigned and was replaced by Ali Hassan Mwinyi. In 1988 Mwinyi reportedly considered making Walden Chief of the TPDF, but passed him over for the appointment. According to some sources, Mwinyi called him to tell him that while he was the most qualified officer for the role, he could not be given the appointment. The reasons for the decision were not specified. By 1987 Walden had been promoted to the rank of major general. In 1989 he was placed in command of Operation Uhai to combat poachers on Tanzanian lands. He spent several nights leading wildlife rangers on patrols in the desert, successfully reducing illegal hunting of elephants. By 1997, Walden served as the Tanzanian military attach√© in London. He later retired from the army.  Death  Walden died on 7 July 2002 and was buried in Mbeya.

In the version known to the Christian Middle Ages, a king wrote in his will that his corpse should be tied to a tree and his three sons told to shoot arrows at it. Whichever hit nearest his heart was to inherit the kingdom. The two elder sons shot arrows, but the youngest refused to do, out of love and respect for his father. The appointed judges of the contest declared him the winner, and so the new king. This is found in the Gesta Romanorum, a Latin work of the thirteenth century that is a \\"collection of moralized anecdotes and tales intended as a manual for preachers\\".Shestack, #147 Solomon is the chief judge of the contest in many versions, and regarding the story as an example of the kingly settlement of disputes, led to it being illustrated in some lavish biblical illuminated manuscripts for the French and other courts. There it is often paired with the better-known Judgement of Solomon, which unlike this story actually appears in the Bible.Stechow, throughout; Hall, 282 Source and depiction Engraving by Master MZ, c. 1500 In the Talmudic version, a man overhears his wife saying to her daughter \\"Why are you not careful in your unlawful acts? I have ten sons and only one is from your father\\". The man's last instructions were that all his property should be left to one son, but he did not say which one. The problem was taken to a rabbi, who advised that each son should go and knock on his father's grave until the father came and explained his intentions. Nine of the sons did so, without response, but the tenth refused. The rabbi judged that he should inherit. The various Christian versions reduce the number of sons, promote the father in status, usually to that of a ruler, and substitute a much more violent disrespect to the father's remains. The issue of the legitimacy of the sons may or may not be included. In the two earliest versions lances are thrown at the corpse, thereafter bows and arrows are always the weapons. The father is variously described as a strong warrior, a very noble king, a Roman Emperor called Polemius, or a \\"prince de Saissone\\".Stechow, 214 In the various texts, naming the judge as Solomon is unusual, and comes in a version with only two sons. But in artistic depictions, three sons and Solomon as judge was usual in manuscript illustrations.Stechow, 214‚Äì215 =Manuscripts= The earliest depiction in art may be in three small roundel illustrations in an illuminated psalter of the later 14th century in the Morgan Library & Museum (MS 183), at the page with Psalm 51 (52). The scene is divided between the roundels, and has two sons, bows and arrows, and a royal judge, no doubt intended as Solomon.Stechow, 215‚Äì216 and Figure 5 A depiction carved on a choir stall in Cologne Cathedral was long mis-identified (as the Justice of Trajan); this comes from the first half of the 14th century.Stechow, 215 ‚Äì his Figure 1 Engraving by Mair von Landshut, c. 1500 Thereafter the story begins to be commonly depicted in the relatively small group of luxury Bible Historiale manuscripts, lavishly illustrated biblical summaries in French, normally as part of a multi-image group at the beginning of the Book of Proverbs, which in the Middle Ages was believed to have been written by Solomon. Often it forms one of four scenes, the others typically being Solomon Teaching (usually with Rehoboam the pupil), and the Judgement of Solomon (with the baby and two mothers). Often, either of the two judgements, of the disputing mothers or the king's sons, is shown over two images, the first of the participants bringing their dispute before the enthroned Solomon.Stechow, 216‚Äì219 =Germany= As printed versions in vernacular languages of the Gesta Romanorum began to appear in the late 15th century, the depiction of the scene increased. The first printed edition in German appeared in Augsburg in 1489, after which the number of German images increased. These included engravings by Mair von Landshut and Master MZ (probably Matth√§us Zasinger of Munich), both of around 1500, and an anonymous early 16th-century drawing.Stechow, 223; Shestack, #147 A drawing by Hans Sch√§ufelein of about 1505 (now Bremen), shows an expansive view of the scene.Stechow, 219 and Figure 14 Different moments from the shooting scene are shown. In the anonymous drawing the archers are taking aim, in Mair's print one son has shot and the next is about to, while the youngest son looks away in disgust. Wolfgang Stechow, who first set out the history and depiction of the story, describes the print as the \\"most subtle and moving interpretation of the story in art, despite its many awkward details\\".Stechow, 223 It emphasizes the moral interpretation of the story, and Solomon is absent. In Master MZ's depiction the shooting has finished and the youngest son is about to be crowned. In this the commanding turbaned figure on horseback represents Solomon, as the judge of the contest.Stechow, 219 It is typical of the obscurity of the subject that this print was called a Martyrdom of Saint Sebastian by the great cataloguer Adam Bartsch. =Italy= Cassone panel by Francesco Bacchiacca, 1523 Italian depictions include a small cassone painting of about 1460 (one of a group of three scenes), a Florentine engraving of 1460‚Äì80, and in a painted miniature in a luxury illuminated copy of a printed Bible in Italian.Stechow, 219‚Äì220 The subject takes the full side of a cassone painted by Francesco Bacchiacca of 1523, now in the Gem√§ldegalerie Alte Meister in Dresden, probably the best known of all depictions.Stechow, 219‚Äì221 Moralizing interpretations The story was given a variety of moralizing interpretations, of which one of the most popular was as a warning against blasphemy. The shooting sons may be identified with heretics and Jews, whose attacks on his truth wounded God, as the arrows wounded the corpse. This idea may have been introduced by the Speculum Morale, long wrongly attributed to Vincent of Beauvais.Stechow, 221‚Äì222 Renaissance classical make-over In the mid-16th century the story, depictions of which were rather in decline, was given a classical makeover. Stechow remarks that \\"It is amusing to see that this was done in a deliberate and avowed literary fake\\".Stechow, 223‚Äì224, 224 quoted. The Swiss scholar Theodor Zwinger gave a version of the story in his influential Theatrum Humanae Vitae (1565), where he named the father as \\"Parysadas, king of the Cimmerian Bosphorus\\" (died 310/309 BC) and also named the sons, explaining that \\"To prevent this story from remaining anonymous, we have made it more dignified by borrowing the names from Diodorus\\".Stechow, 224 Diodorus does indeed recount an inheritance dispute between the sons of this king,Book 20, chapters 22‚Äì26 but makes it clear it was settled by more conventional means, namely a civil war. These identifications were followed in literary renditions in various languages, and can be detected in a few 17th-century depictions in art, where \\"Roman\\" costume is worn.

Metacritic, which assigns a weighted average score out of 100 to reviews from film critics, posts a rating score of 78 based on 10 reviews. While the film has not received any negative reviews, New York Times critic Ben Kenigsberg, noted Maddin's \\"slight arrogance in presuming that one of the greatest films of all time [Hitchcock's Vertigo ...] could be approximated, even a little, using clips from lesser directors\\" but also notes that \\"if trying to recreate a lost object of obsession from the materials at hand was Hitchcock‚Äôs subject, then he couldn‚Äôt ask for a more fitting tribute\\" and calls the movie \\" a marvel of film scholarship.\\" Ty Burr, writing for the Boston Globe, called the film \\"eerie, witty, and unexpectedly moving\\" and compared it to Christian Marclay's installation film The Clock. Critics also noted that, in addition to serving as a tribute to Hitchcock's Vertigo and a method of deconstructing its own self-critical aspects (which Maddin has discussed in interviews), the film pays homage to the city of San Francisco and its stature in film history, serving as \\"a scrambled history of San Francisco told through moving pictures.\\" References External links  Category:Canadian films Category:English-language films Category:Films directed by Guy Maddin Category:Films shot in Winnipeg Category:2017 films ","title":"The Green Fog"},{"id":"59639188","text":"Simon Kainzwaldner (born 24 February 1994) is an Italian Olympic luge athlete who currently races for his nation on the World Cup circuit in the Men's doubles event as a pair with Emanuel Rieder.

In January 2020, she was polling at about 1 to 2 percent. Had she won, she would have become the first female, Hindu, and Samoan president in American history, and the youngest person to ever hold the office. She made reducing military activity abroad a central message of her campaign. On March 19, 2020, Gabbard dropped out of the 2020 election and endorsed former Vice President Joe Biden. Gabbard speaking to the California Democratic Party State Convention in June 2019 Background Gabbard had been a rising figure in the Democratic Party in the lead-up to the 2016 election cycle, when she served as Vice-Chairman of the Democratic National Committee (DNC). Gabbard appeared on Joe Rogan's podcast in both September and November 2018, the latter along with Jocko Willink. On October 19, 2018, Politico reported that Gabbard was \\"weighing a 2020 presidential bid\\" but would not make an announcement until after the 2018 midterm elections. On December 12, 2018, Gabbard said on MSNBC's Hardball with Chris Matthews that she was \\"seriously considering\\" running for president in 2020. Democratic primary campaign = Launch = On January 11, 2019, in an interview with CNN's Van Jones, Gabbard confirmed her intention to seek the Democratic presidential nomination. On January 24, she formally launched her campaign by releasing a video on her website. The following week, NBC News notified the Gabbard campaign they would be publishing a story the week after her campaign kickoff rally, where NBC would assert Gabbard was supported by the \\"Russian propaganda machine\\". Instead, NBC released the story two hours before her campaign kickoff in Hawaii on February 2. Glenn Greenwald criticized NBC for relying on a firm that had previously tried to imitate \\"an elaborate 'false flag' operation\\" that would plant the idea that Alabama Senatorial candidate Roy Moore was being supported by a \\"Russian botnet\\". Shortly after the announcement, campaign manager Rania Batrice and consulting firm Revolution Messaging departed from the campaign. Politico reported that sources \\"familiar with the campaign\\" referred to Gabbard as \\"indecisive and impulsive\\". Her staff insists that the vacancy in the campaign manager position is the result of \\"careful deliberation, not campaign dysfunction.\\" =Debates= Gabbard was the most-searched-for candidate on Google after both the first and second Democratic primary debates. During the second debate, Gabbard criticized Kamala Harris's record as attorney general of California, accusing her of holding innocent people on death row and pointing out Harris's prosecution of marijuana crimes after admitting her own use. In May 2019, the DNC announced that candidates would need to have at least 130,000 individual donors and have received at least 2% support in four qualifying polls between June 28 and August 28 in order to qualify for the third primary debate. By August 2, the campaign had met the qualifying donor threshold, but had not yet reached the polling threshold. On July 27, Tulsi Now Inc. filed a lawsuit against Google alleging that the internet company suspended, for no proper cause, the campaign's Google Ads account for several hours after the first primary debate. Gabbard declared: \\"Google plays favorites, with no warning, no transparency ‚Äî and no accountability (until now).\\" The lawsuit contends that Google had treated the campaign's mail differently than it treated other campaigns' mail and seeks \\"an injunction against Google from further meddling in the election and damages of at least $50 million.\\" On March 3, 2020, the lawsuit was dismissed by a federal judge. Tulsi Gabbard poll results during qualification period for September 2019 debates of the 2020 Democratic Party presidential primaries On August 23, the Gabbard campaign criticized the stark drop in number of polls released by DNC-qualified polling organizations following the second debate. Five polls were released in the two weeks following the third debate. By August 26, two days before the deadline, the Gabbard campaign had exceeded the threshold on only two qualifying polls. The campaign called on the DNC to expand the selection of polls considered for qualification, noting that Gabbard had exceeded the 2% threshold in several unapproved polls.* Nevertheless, Gabbard went on to qualify for both the October and November debates. Tulsi Gabbard poll results during qualification period for December 2019 debate of the 2020 Democratic Party presidential primaries On December 9, Gabbard announced that she would not attend the December debate \\"regardless of whether or not there are qualifying polls.\\" At the time of her announcement she had met the donor requirement and was one poll short of meeting the polling requirement for that debate. Between the November debate and her announcement there had been no qualifying polls in the early primary states and only two nationwide polls and Gabbard's campaign had unsuccessfully requested the DNC to accept an additional poll in New Hampshire as qualifying. Although she met the donor requirement for the December debate, she did not meet the polling requirement. The Boston Globe's Joe Battenfeld wrote that Gabbard and several other low-polling candidates \\"never had much of a chance\\" to qualify because of the low number of DNC-certified polls after the November debate. Nine presidential contenders signed an open letter from candidate Cory Booker to the DNC in which they criticized the committee for \\"unnecessarily and artificially narrowing\\" the pool of presidential candidates \\"before voters have had a chance to be heard\\". The DNC rejected the request by noting that candidates had a chance to give their feedback on the process before it was adopted and \\"not one campaign objected\\" to it. Following Gabbard's participation in the November 2019 debate, she has not qualified for any further debates. Although Gabbard did have enough delegates to participate in the mid-March debate under the rules for previous debates, the qualification threshold increased. A DNC spokesperson stated, \\"Whoever is on the path of getting those delegates, we made sure we had a criterion that is fair and to make sure that people who are viable for the presidency and for the nomination are going to be on that.\\" =Fundraising= In mid-2017 Gabbard pledged to no longer accept money from political action committees. In the first quarter of 2019, the campaign raised $4,495,770, with $1,995,770 from individual donations and $2,500,000 transferred from Gabbard's congressional campaign. In the second quarter, the campaign raised $1,567,204, bringing the total to $6,062,974 with 69% coming from \\"small dollar\\" donors giving $200 or less. In the third quarter, the campaign raised $3,032,159, bringing the total to $9,095,133 with 68% coming from small dollar donors giving $200 or less. In the fourth quarter, the campaign raised $3.4 million, bringing the total to $12.6 million. During 2019, Gabbard's campaign raised $10 million from individual contributions, which is the 11th position among all Democratic candidates. 61% of these contributions were small dollar donations below $200. By January 26, 2020, the campaign had met the DNC's 225,000 individual donors qualifying criterion for participating in the first February 2020 debate, though she failed to reach the polling criteria. =Media coverage and controversy= Gabbard again appeared on The Joe Rogan Experience in May 2019, which was praised by Medium's Jake Mercier. However, Gabbard received disproportionately little mainstream media coverage in relation to her polling position.Multiple sources:   * A study by Axios found that at end of August 2019, Gabbard was the 14th-most-mentioned candidate in cable news coverage even though she was polling in ninth place nationally. In addition, much of the coverage her campaign has received has been negative. In May 2019, Rolling Stones Matt Taibbi stated, \\"we have hit a new low in campaign hit pieces\\" after critical coverage of Gabbard's campaign by CNN, The Daily Beast, and Politico. The Hill's Krystal Ball and Saagar Enjeti both described Gabbard as \\"the most unfairly maligned person in Washington\\". Lexicostatistical analysis confirmed that she received the most negative coverage during the June‚ÄìSeptember period. After both the November and December 2019 Democratic debates, Saturday Night Lives parodies of the debates portrayed Gabbard as a villain, introducing her with menacing music and flashing lights. In January and February 2020, CNN was criticized for snubbing Gabbard when the network did not invite her to their February New Hampshire town halls, although they invited lower-polling candidates. Gabbard's supporters held a protest near the venue against her exclusion by CNN. Ryan Grim opined that Gabbard's exclusion from CNN's town halls showed that the media perceived Gabbard as an illegitimate candidate and that her exclusion is undemocratic.  \\"Russian asset\\" accusations A history of \\"bad blood\\" between Gabbard and Clinton had already been ongoing. During the 2016 United States presidential election, Tulsi Gabbard‚Äîthen a member of the U.S. House of Representatives and vice chair of the Democratic National Committee (DNC)‚Äîendorsed Bernie Sanders for the Democratic Party's presidential nominee over his rival Hillary Clinton. In order to issue the endorsement, Gabbard first resigned as DNC vice-chair. According to the Washington Post, Gabbard's endorsement of Sanders was the genesis of what is described as \\"bad blood\\" between her and Clinton. On the day Gabbard held her 2020 campaign launch event, NBC reported that \\"the main English-language news sites employed by Russia in its 2016 election meddling shows... Gabbard... has become a favorite of the sites Moscow used when it interfered in 2016.\\" In October 2019, The New York Times reported that \\"an independent analysis of the Russian news media found that RT, the Kremlin- backed news agency, mentioned Gabbard frequently for a candidate polling in single digits, according to data collected by the Alliance for Securing Democracy.\\" In an October 12, 2019 article in the New York Times, correspondent Lisa Lerer reported that unnamed members of the Democratic Party had unspecified concerns \\"about supportive signs from online bot activity and the Russian news media\\" for Tulsi Gabbard, who was at the time seeking the party's nomination in the 2020 United States presidential election. Lerer also reported that the unspecified concerns were dismissed by Gabbard's supporters who considered them to be a conspiracy theory \\"designed to delegitimize her campaign and her foreign policy views\\". On October 18, 2019, Hillary Clinton was reported to have said in an interview the day before on David Plouffe's podcast Campaign HQ with David Plouffe that Russia was \\"grooming\\" a female Democrat to run as a third-party candidate who would help President Trump win reelection by a spoiler effect. In the interview, Clinton stated, \\"I'm not making any predictions, but I think they've got their eye on somebody who is currently in the Democratic primary and are grooming her to be the third-party candidate. She's the favorite of the Russians\\". Following her remarks about Gabbard, Clinton then declared that Jill Stein was \\"also a Russian asset... she's a Russian asset, I mean, totally\\". That afternoon, Gabbard reacted to the widespread media reports by condemning Clinton's remarks in a series of Tweets. CNN host Van Jones, meanwhile, opined that Clinton's statement was \\"a complete smear with no facts\\". Several of her 2020 Democratic primary contenders defended Gabbard, including Bernie Sanders who tweeted \\"it is outrageous for anyone to suggest that Tulsi is a foreign asset\\". In reference to Clinton's allegation against Jill Stein, the Green Party issued a statement describing Clinton as \\"an asset of Wall Street, the police state and war\\" and declaring the assertion to be \\"salty neo-McCarthyism\\". A CNN reporter subsequently inquired of Clinton spokesman Nick Merrill if Clinton was referring to Gabbard when she stated \\"somebody who is currently in the Democratic primary\\", to which Merrill replied, \\"If the nesting doll fits.\\" Merrill added that Gabbard were \\"aligned with Russian interests.\\" During the evening, after Clinton's comments drew considerable criticism from both Democrats and Republicans, Merrill tweeted that Clinton was alleging Republicans were \\"grooming\\" Gabbard, not \\"the Russians\\", and that Clinton had been misinterpreted. During the following week, Clinton's \\"Russian asset\\" accusation against Gabbard was widely reported in the media and drew a lot of criticism, until some outlets published corrections on October 24, changing the identity of the \\"grooming\\" entity from \\"Russians\\" to \\"Republicans\\". The Nation's James Carden compared the insinuations by Clinton and some establishment journalists against Gabbard with similar events involving other politicians and opined that these insinuations were part of what he felt was a long campaign of demonization and vilification against critics of the establishment consensus regarding Russia, and showed that McCarthyism had gone mainstream. Gabbard thanked Clinton on Twitter for \\"com[ing] out from behind the curtain\\" of what she called \\"a concerted campaign to destroy [her] reputation\\". In December 2019, about 25 to 30 of Gabbard's campaign advertisement signs in Keene, New Hampshire, were the target of political vandalism when unknown persons defaced the signs by gluing the hammer and sickle symbol from the national flag of the Soviet Union onto them. Gabbard's campaign said this was \\"a continuation of the campaign of smears and intimidation that has been waged against Tulsi since she announced her candidacy.\\" =Gabbard v. Clinton= Gabbard demanded a public retraction in November 2019, and, after not receiving one, she and her campaign organization, Tulsi Now, filed a defamation lawsuit on January 22, 2020 in the United States District Court for the Southern District of New York against Clinton, seeking damages in excess of $50 million. Gabbard's complaint alleged that Clinton's remark was intended to impugn Gabbard as an agent of influence of the Russian Federation and \\"derail Tulsi's presidential campaign\\". Legal experts stated that Gabbard's lawsuit was highly unlikely to succeed given the high \\"actual malice\\" standard that applies to suits claiming defamation of a public figure. CNN's Dan Merica and New York's Ed Kilgore suggested that the lawsuit is a stunt to gain Gabbard publicity. In May 2020, Gabbard dropped her lawsuit against Clinton. Gabbard also filed a lawsuit against Google for temporarily suspending her campaign's advertising account after an automated Google system detected unusual activity (the account was quickly reinstated). Gabbard asserted that Google had engaged in \\"election manipulation\\" and tried to \\"silence\\" her in violation of the First Amendment. A federal judge dismissed the lawsuit in March 2020, ruling that Google, as a private company, is not a state actor subject to the First Amendment.Rachel Sandler, Judge Throws Out Tulsi Gabbard Lawsuit Claiming Google Was Trying To 'Silence' Her, Forbes (March 4, 2020). =Polling= Tulsi Gabbard poll results during qualification period for February 2020 debate of the 2020 Democratic Party presidential primaries Gabbard consistently polled in single digits in national polls. Gabbard polled at 1% in several major polls. In a poll conducted between July 9 and 18 of registered Democrats in New Hampshire, Gabbard and former Representative Beto O'Rourke were tied in sixth place at 2%. On August 19, 2019, Gabbard garnered 4.8% of the Iowa State Fair Straw Poll, placing 7th in a field of 24. On August 23, 2019, Gabbard's campaign stated that she had received 2% or more in 26 national and statewide polls, but only two of the polls were certified by the DNC. Gabbard received 4% in the early primary states subset of two non-qualifying Morning Consult national polls from August 25 and September 1. On September 4 she received 1% in the same states in qualifying polls sponsored by CBS News. Between the debates of July 31 and September 12, Gabbard's polling average in New Hampshire was 1% in one debate-qualifying poll and 4.6% in five non-qualifying polls. By November 27, Gabbard held the fifth position in New Hampshire with 5% in the RealClearPolitics polling average. In early February 2020, Gabbard received 1.8% in the national polling average and 4.7% in the New Hampshire polling average. A national poll in March 2020 gave her 5%.Tulsi Gabbard poll results in New Hampshire = Primary elections =  February  In Iowa, Gabbard spent $195,000 on television advertisements. She received 0.2% of votes in the initial alignment of the Iowa caucuses and no delegates for the national convention. After the reporting difficulties at the caucus, Gabbard called for DNC chair Tom Perez to resign. In New Hampshire, Gabbard spent $1 million on television advertising, amounting to 19% of Bernie Sanders' expenses. She held 130 campaign events, the second most after Andrew Yang, but neither gained traction in polls. In the New Hampshire primary, Gabbard received 3.3% of votes and no national delegates. In Nevada, she received 353 votes (0.3%) in the first alignment and 32 in the final alignment to get 4 of the 14,491 county convention delegates.  March  In the American Samoan caucus, Gabbard received 103 votes -- or 29.3% of the total caucus-goers -- and, initially, one delegate. She later earned a second delegate from American Samoa after an error made by the officials was discovered. Of the Super Tuesday primaries in the contiguous states, Gabbard received her highest percentage in Oklahoma, where she won 1.7% of the votes. In Super Tuesday II, Gabbard received 868 votes (1%) in Idaho, 9,461 votes (1%) in Michigan, 989 votes (0%) in Mississippi, 4,879 votes (1%) in Missouri, and 89 votes (1%) in North Dakota. She received 12,391 votes, or 0.85%, in the Washington State Democratic Primary. Gabbard had a similar performance in the Super Tuesday III primaries, in each of which she received less than 1% of the vote. Following the suspension of the campaigns of all the Democratic Party candidates except Joe Biden and Bernie Sanders by early March 2020, Gabbard became the only woman or person of color still in the presidential race. She told ABC News she was staying in the race because it is \\"an opportunity to speak to Americans every single day about the sea change we need in our foreign policy.\\" In March, during the coronavirus pandemic, Gabbard stated in a tweet that she was opposed to holding primaries until the pandemic eases due to the risk of the virus spreading, along with concerns that it could reduce turnout among elderly voters. On March 19, 2020, Gabbard dropped out of the 2020 election and endorsed Vice President Joe Biden.

Early years Born in Glasgow, Scotland, Reid served in the Royal Navy from 1944 to 1947 and then obtained a first-class honours degree in electrical engineering from the University of Glasgow winning the Howe Prize in Electrical EngineeringUniversity of Glasgow: The Howe Prize in Electrical Engineering. Migrating to Australia in 1952, Reid served for five years as an electrical lieutenant in the Royal Australian Navy.

The following year, he was put in charge of Woomera‚Äôs RCA AN/FPS-16 Instrumentation Radar which tracked NASA's Project Mercury spacecraft. After leaving Woomera in 1962, Reid became a senior lecturer in electrical engineering at the South Australian Institute of Technology. In 1964, he was appointed inaugural director of NASA's Orroral Valley Tracking Station, south of Canberra. Because of management problems at the nearby Honeysuckle Creek Tracking Station, Reid was transferred there as director in 1967 to provide firm leadership. Honeysuckle‚Äôs role was to supply uplink and down link communications between Apollo astronauts and mission control. Just before 1 pm on 21 July 1969, AEST, Honeysuckle‚Äôs 85-foot dish was providing backup to a 210-foot dish in Goldstone, California, including a backup TV link with the Apollo Lunar Module, Eagle. Due to technical difficulties, Goldstone could not relay broadcast quality TV of Neil Armstrong as he descended the Eagle's ladder to the Moon‚Äôs surface. At the last minute, mission control switched over to Honeysuckle which transmitted to what was then the largest TV audience in history the footage of Armstrong stepping onto the Moon. In 1970, Reid became director of the nearby Tidbinbilla Tracking Station, which maintained communications with space craft travelling to the outer edges of the solar system and beyond. After overseeing communications with spacecraft from the Pioneer Program, Mariner Program and Voyager Program, Reid retired in 1988. Honours and awards For his work as a space tracker, Reid was appointed as a Member of the Order of the British Empire Appointed MBE: Supplement to the London Gazette 1 January 1970 : p.38 (MBE) in 1970 and in 1989 he was presented with the NASA Exceptional Public Service Medal. Personal life In 1952, Reid married Betty McKenna and they had four children. Following Betty's death in 1965, he married Margaret McLachlan. As Senator Reid, Margaret later went into politics, rising to become the first female president of the Australian Senate.

She was the first female gynecologist in the Balkans, the first head of the Department of Maternity and Women's Diseases in Ni≈°, and the first woman who performed a caesarean section in Serbia. Early years and education Eva Haljecka Petkoviƒá was born in 1870, in a village of Congress Poland, at the border with the Russian Empire. Eva's mother died during her childbirth. Her father, Marko Haljecki, was a construction engineer. Due to the nature of his business, she often traveled with him and moved often. Petkoviƒá was educated by her father. She completed her primary school in Odessa, and her secondary school in Kiev, where her father worked. After finishing high school, she enrolled in medical school in 1886, studying in University of Bern, and then University of Zurich, where she graduated in 1891. She completed her specialization at the University of Vienna at the school's Gynecology and Obstetric Clinic in the class of Professor Friedrich Saout. Career After completing her studies, she joined her father, who worked on the construction of a dock and the Danube coastline near Belgrade. She started her first job in January 1892, in Belgrade, by the decision of the Ministry of Internal Affairs of Serbia, as a medical assistant at the General State Hospital in Belgrade. In 1905, she got the job of a secondary doctor at the Gynecology-Babic Department of the General State Hospital, also by the decision of the Ministry of Internal Affairs of Serbia. In 1909, Petkoviƒá went to Ni≈° where she was appointed as the Secondary Doctor of the Nis District Hospital. In Ni≈°, she served as the head of the District Hospital during the Balkan Wars from 1912 to 1913. During the World War I, from 1915, she was a prisoner of the Bulgarian army during the occupation of Nis, but returned to our position in December 1918 through September 1919. Besides the work of a manager and a doctor, Petkoviƒá also worked in cholera slums, where there were venereal, ocular and other patients, whom the Nis-English hospital did not want to receive at the time. After working as head of the District Hospital to the end of World War I, Eva became an assistant doctor at the Department of Maternity and Women's Diseases of the Nis District Hospital the same year. On 3 January 1920, by the decree of the Ministry, she became the head of the Department of the Ni≈° District Hospital, and remained in office until 1924, when she retired. She was the first woman in the Balkans who performed a Caesarean section, in 1910, the first gynecologist in the Balkans, and the first head of the Department of Maternity and Female Diseases in Ni≈°. Petkoviƒá was one of the most prominent fighters for equalizing the rights of women with the rights of men. In 1908, she sent an objection to National Assembly of Serbia. In her argument, she asked for the equalization of the rights of women doctors with the rights of men doctors‚Äî She devoted her lifetime to professional work and improvement of medicine, especially to the improvement of women's health. She was one of the most active members of the Serbian Medical Society in Belgrade and Nis. For her devotion and work in the field of medicine, she was honored with the Royal Order of the Holy Savior of the Fifth Order (1913); the Cross of Mercy, for caring for sick and wounded during and after the war (1914); and the Royal Order of the Holy Savior of the Fourth Order (1915).

Goblinshead. p.184 or House is a 17th-century house, about east of Huntly, Aberdeenshire, Scotland, and west of Largue, on the site of a 13th-century castle. History The original castle was burnt in 1630; the present house was built in1656, but remodelled in 1753, and extended in 1790. It probably incorporates part of the original castle. The house, which was restored in 1974, is still occupied. The Crichtons held the property, which James V of Scotland visited in 1535, but it passed to the Morrisons in 1690. The burning of 1630 was during a feud with the Gordons. The Lord of Rothiemay, Lord Aboyne, and four others, were killed in the burning, but the Crichton laird and his people escaped. Crichton of Frendraught was charged with but acquitted of their murder; but one of his servants, John Meldrum, was executed. This event was celebrated in the ballad, ‚Äò'The Fire of Frendraught‚Äô‚Äô, ballad 196 in the Child Ballads. Buchan, John (1928) Montrose. Thomas Nelson (publisher)}} p.201 The Gordons gathered the 'ashes and brynt bones' of the victims and buried them at the Kirk of Gartly. His son, James Crichton, was created Viscount Frendraught in 1642. He fought against James Graham, 1st Marquess of Montrose at the battle of Aberdeen, and with him in 1650 at the battle of Carbisdale, where he was wounded and gave his horse to Montrose to allow his escape. Buchan, p. 201, p.356 While it is said that he was captured and died soon after, John Buchan says that he lived until 1664 or 1665, and that another story, that he committed suicide after the battle, although accepted by the Dictionary of National Biography, is without foundation.Buchan, p. 201 Structure The present house The present structure has been described as an extended house of considerable complexity and charm. Cellars in the west wing probably belong to the original building, while two small chamfered windows in the west gable seem to be the oldest features. There are fragments of the adjacent tower, which was demolished 1947, adhering to the east elevation. The rebuilding in the 17th century consists of an imposing seven-window harled front with an ashlar-faced three window centre, which is topped by a semicircular pediment, slightly advanced. The porch, which has a 1688 datestone, was added when the angle tower was embellished with battlements and bartizans, about 1832. There are crowstepped offices to the north of the court, which have now been converted; this structure dates from the 18th century or earlier. Tradition The ghost of Lady Elizabeth Crichton, who died in the 17th century, who may have been involved in the burning, is said to haunt the castle. Sightings were reported during the 20th century. *Castles in Great Britain and Ireland *List of castles in Scotland References Category:Castles in Aberdeenshire ","title":"Frendraught Castle"},{"id":"59639410","text":"R√≠o Arriba is a barrio in the municipality of Arecibo, Puerto Rico.

Part of the upper deck of the bus was torn off on impact, killing three people on board, as well as injuring 23 others. The driver was arrested at the scene for allegedly failing to cooperate with police, and was released with no charges laid.  Investigation  The Ottawa Police Service are leading the investigation into the collision. From the early hours, experts, the public and politicians called on the City of Ottawa to invite the Transportation Safety Board, TSB, an independent federal agency that advances transportation safety, to conduct a full safety investigation. On January 16, five days after the crash, the Ottawa police accepted an offer of technical assistance from the TSB. The Ottawa police stated that the skills of the TSB will augment the reconstruction portion of the investigation especially in terms of collision reconstruction, human factors and electronic data gathering, based on the TSB's engineering expertise in collision reconstruction and analysis of vehicle and road design. The bus crash falls outside the current mandate of the TSB, which includes only air, rail, marine and pipeline transportation. Without jurisdiction, the TSB could not lead a full investigation, or have the authority to make national safety recommendations based on their findings.

It was created for the FIA World Endurance Championship, and was held for the first time on 15 March 2019 as the sixth round of the 2018‚Äì19 FIA World Endurance Championship.  Race History  The FIA/ACO announced a provisional schedule on 1st September 2017 that shifted the FIA World Endurance Championship calendar from a spring to autumn layout with the 24 Hours of Le Mans marque event held in the middle of the championship, and include two runnings of Le Mans. This \\"super season\\" of eight races spanned more than a year instead of the usual eight months. The shift allowed the following 2019‚Äì20 season to return to a shorter length by starting in the autumn and concluding at Le Mans in the summer. The Provisional Calendar saw a raft of changes, with several races dropped, but included a return to Sebring for the first time since 2012. In the provisional calendar issued, the race was originally planned to be run as a second 12-hour race after the IMSA Mobil 1 12 Hours of Sebring on the same weekend, and would start at midnight after the conclusion of the IMSA 12 hours. On 21st September 2017, the race became known as the 1,500 Miles of Sebring, to avoid confusion between the 2 events, at the FIA World Motor Sport Council meeting in Paris. On 4th April 2018, it was announced that the race would become shortened to 1,000 Miles or 268 laps, have a time limit of 8 Hours, and would take place on March 15 instead, prior to the start of the 12 Hours of Sebring, rather than after the race. A new pit lane would also be built for the race. The second race, originally scheduled for 20th March 2020, was cancelled as a result of the COVID-19 pandemic. On 11th March, United States president Donald Trump announced a suspension of travel by non- US citizens from Europe to the United States. Many of the drivers and team personnel were in Europe, and thus would be unable to travel to the United States for the race. The next day, the WEC announced the cancellation of the race. The 2020 race was also planned to include a schedule change. Previously, the race had run from 4 p.m. to midnight, with the short duration between the 1,000 Miles and the 12 Hour race causing challenges for both track and support personnel, as well as drivers who were competing in both the WEC race and the Mobil 1 Twelve Hours of Sebring on the following day. This change ensured a 15-hour break between the 2 races.

After college, he returned to the Pacific Northwest to join his family's lumber business. Over the years, he was the top executive for a number of Collins family businesses. He was also an active leader in several timber- related industry groups and contributed to selected education and religious institutions.  Early life  Collins was born in Ostrander, Washington, on April 29, 1902, the son of Everell Stanton Collins and Mary (Laffey) Collins. The Collins family was one of the wealthiest and most influential families in Oregon at that time.

While at Willamette, he joined Kappa Gamma Rho fraternity.\\"Organize Four New Fraternities at Willamette U.\\", Oregon Daily Journal, Portland, Oregon, September 26, 1920, p. 11. During his senior year, Collins was editor of the university's yearbook.\\"Wallulah Soon Ready\\", Statesman Journal, Salem, Oregon, May 25, 1922, p. 5. Collins graduated from Willamette with a bachelor's degree in 1922. He then went on to graduate school at Harvard University, where he earned a master's degree in business in 1925.  Businessman  In 1925, the Collins family purchased timber land and a sawmill in Glenwood, Washington. The new business was called the Mount Adams Pine Company. The Collins family hired J. T. \\"Mac\\" McDonald to run the Glenwood sawmill operation. After graduating from Harvard, Collins returned to the Pacific Northwest to join the family business at Glenwood with McDonald as his mentor. In addition to his hands-on experience in Glenwood, Collins began developing his executive skills. In 1926, Collins was elected to the board of directors of the Oregon Pulp and Paper Company.\\"Salem's Big Mill is Doing its Capacity and Adding Very Materially to its Efficiency in Many Ways; Largest of its Kind in All this Section\\", Statesman Journal, Salem, Oregon, September 23, 1926, p. 9.

By 1931, the timber supply in the Glenwood area had run low, so the Collins family sold the sawmill and the related local timber land. Collins wanted to use the revenue from the Glenwood sale to purchase the Grande Ronde Lumber Company in Pondosa, Oregon. While his father was not convinced this was a good investment, he reluctantly approved the acquisition. Once the purchase was complete, Collins relocated much of the Glenwood workforce to Pondosa, including J. T. McDonald. The Pondosa operation included a railroad used to haul trees from the forest to the sawmill. However, as cutting operations moved farther from the mill extending the railroad become very expensive, so the company began experimenting with truck logging. This proved successful, and in 1937, the Collins family joined McDonald in a truck logging business called the McDonald Logging Company. In 1939, a second joint-venture logging company was formed in Lakeview, Oregon. During the 1930s, Collins served as an officer in a number of lumbermen's associations, helping to develop forest industry standards. In 1935, he was elected to the regional board of directors for the Western Pine Association and then appointed regional chairman.\\"Lumbermen Elect New Directorate\\", La Grande Observer, LaGrande, Oregon, January 24, 1935, p. 1.

Collins' father died in 1940. In his father's will, Collins was given the rights to develop of virgin timber land in the Sierra Nevada Mountains near the small community of Chester, California. The property was known as the Curtis, Collins and Holbrook Company lands. Collins continued to manage the Grande Ronde Pine Company as he began developing the Chester property as a long-term sustainable forest. The first logs came out of the Curtis, Collins and Holbrook forest in 1941. However, the onset of World War II made development plans subject to the approval of the United States Government's War Production Board. Nevertheless, the new Chester sawmill began production in early 1943. In September 1942, Collins was commissioned as a lieutenant in the United States Naval Reserve. This was a busy time for Collins. While he was serving in the navy, Collins kept in touch with his sawmill and forest managers by telephone.\\"Elmer R. Goudy Quits State Post\\", Bend Bulletin, Bend, Oregon, October 30, 1942, p. 1.

Despite his busy wartime work schedule, Collins married Maribeth Akin Wilson on March 12, 1943. Together they had four children. In 1944, the Collins-McDonald truck logging business was expanded into a sawmill operation when the partnership bought the Lakeview Lumber Company, changing its name to the Lakeview Sawmill Company. The sawmill proved to be a profitable venture and in 1945 a second sawmill, the Fremont Sawmill, was added to the Lakeview operation. Despite two fires, one at each mill, both operations were rebuilt and were producing lumber within 90 days of the fires.\\"Lakeview Mill Changes Hands\\", Herald and News, Klamath Falls, Oregon, January 18, 1944, p. 7. Since 1910, the Collins family had been a partner in the Elk Lumber Company in Medford, Oregon. In 1946, the family along with their chief forester, George Flanagan, bought out the other partners. They updated the sawmill plant and equipment, creating a state-of the-art operation. The new mill facility began production later that year with Flanagan as general manager. Over the next several decades, Collins served on the boards of directors of Crown Zellerbach Corporation, Standard Insurance Company, United States National Bank, and the National Lumber Manufacturers Association. He also served as chairman of the Forest Industries Council.\\"Legal Center a Milestone\\", Capital Journal, Salem, Oregon, August 30, 1967, p. 28.

Directed by Oren Jacoby, the film premiered at the 2017 Tribeca Film Festival where it was the audience award runner-up. Synopsis Hambleton, a Canadian born painter first came to New York City in the early 1980s and gained his initial round of renown for his chalk outline paintings created as if at the scenes of homicides to which he sometimes added a splash of red paint to indicate blood spilled. In his next series he gained even more notoriety for his \\"Shadowman\\" paintings of black as night figures in unexpected places seemingly coming right at you from locations everywhere; all once upon a time in downtown Manhattan (especially in the East Village neighborhood where he was a charter member of its famed art gallery scene). Next, Hambleton fell into a spiral of addiction and changed his course of art style veering into almost academic landscapes though at times pastorals which seemed to some as if to have been influenced by rush sensation of oncoming heroin. Later his career took an upswing when he was discovered by two promoters/art dealers who brought in the international fashion legend Giorgio Armani. However again he stumbled until being patronized by a French billionaire, Vladimir Restoin Roitfeld, who put him up at the Trump Soho hotel in exchange for one painting a month, though he was eventually tossed for destroying his room. He then moves into a less pricey hotel in Manhattan's Chinatown. The film leaves wondering whether Hambleton who is seen suffering from skin cancer will once again survive. Reaction Glenn Kenny in reviewing the film for the New York Times said of Jacoby's film: \\"his intense documentary shows a driven creator walking the walk, so to speak, in the most perverse fashion possible. The story is both repellent and strangely inspiring\\". Fionnuala Halligan, the chief film critic for Screendaily in reviewing the picture in the periodical started \\"he myth of the tortured artist collides with the art documentary in Shadowman, a wholly engaging and often gripping look at the chaotic career of troubled 1980s graffiti artist Richard Hambleton\\".

By combining graphics with the traditional method of using text, the result is information that is captured and communicated visually and artistically. Sketchnoting can be used in a variety of settings and scenarios, such as at conferences, work meetings, classes in school, sporting events, and more. Some elements associated with sketchnoting techniques include using text, emphasized text, basic shapes, containers, connectors, icons and symbols, and sketches and illustrations.  History  In 2006, designer and author Michael Rohde created the sketchnote method. Rohde found traditional notetaking stressful because he felt he could not capture every detail. With that, he wanted to combine traditional note taking methods with doodling to create more memorable notes. After testing out this new technique, Rohde found that it helped him stay focused on the topic at hand, and his memory retention of his notes improved due to the illustrations and visual appeal. At first, Rohde labeled his notes as \\"sketchnotes\\" because his technique combined words and sketches to capture key ideas. He later found this word to be fitting, and naturally kept this term. After continuous practice, seven years later, Rohde published two books, The Sketchnote Handbook and The Sketchnote Workbook to inspire others to try sketchnoting.  How to sketchnote  Planning: The first step involves planning how to take notes and thinking about what components can affect the sketchnotes. Things to consider include notetaking materials, the agenda of the presentation, and the speaker. Listening: The next step is to listen and pay close attention to the speaker. Things to listen for include quotes that summarize key ideas and important details. Processing: After listening to the speaker, start processing the content and decide what should be noted. This step involves taking the time to make sense of the information captured in the moment before recording the content. The notes should not reflect everything said by the speaker, nor should they be extremely comprehensive. Writing: After processing the content and deciding what information is relevant, begin writing these key ideas down. This should be done quickly, while maintaining consistency and legibility. Drawing: Illustrations and visual elements can be added to supplement written content.  Elements  A few visual elements used in sketchnotes Text: used for traditional methods of note taking. An example of this is handwritten notes. Handwriting should be consistent and legible. Emphasis Text: used to make certain text and information stand out. This is commonly used for important concepts or headings. Text can be emphasized by adding a variation to existing handwriting, such as bolding, bubbling letters, or capitalization. Basic Shapes: include basic structures such as rectangles, circles, and triangles. These can be used in substitution for the traditional bullet points. Combining these shapes could also create different figures to represent different information. Containers: can be used when trying to group together similar ideas. Examples include thought bubbles, boxes, and banners. Connectors: can be used to connect related ideas to one another. Arrows, dotted lines, and paths can be used to connect one concept to another. Icons and Symbols: should be easy to draw and can be used as a visuals in notes. Sketches and Illustrations: pictures and drawings can be used to illustrate analogies or metaphors in an artistic way. Furthermore, these should be quick, easy to draw, and relevant to the content of the notes. Shading: can be used to add dimension and contrast. Colors: can be used to distinguish and differentiate the content of the notes. Color choices should focus on clarity over aesthetics.  Misconceptions  Right/Wrong Methods: There is no right or wrong way to sketchnote. Due to various ability levels, not all methods are universally efficient for everyone, resulting in individual styles of sketchnoting. Knowing How to Draw Well: Sketchnoting is not about the sketches or artistic ability. It is about using taking notes in a visual way that makes sense to the individual and enhances their learning, whether that is through text, doodles, or images. Furthermore, it is about capturing what was heard and making it memorable for the notetaker. Drawing and Text Limitations: Illustrations are not limited to only sketches; they can be arrows, shapes, icons, or containers. Similarly, text could be used as little or as much as the notetaker desires, as there is no correct or uniform way to sketchnote.

(November 21, 1813 ‚Äì July 3, 1885) was an American Catholic priest and Jesuit who served in prominent religious and academic positions, including as provincial superior of the Jesuit Maryland Province and president of Georgetown University. He was born in Maryland and attended Georgetown University, where he co-founded the Philodemic Society. After entering the Society of Jesus and becoming a professor at Georgetown, he led St. John's Literary Institution and St. John the Evangelist Church in Frederick, Maryland. He was appointed president of Georgetown University in 1851, holding the office for two years, during which time he oversaw expansion of the university's library. The First Plenary Council of Baltimore was held at Georgetown during his tenure. As provincial superior, Stonestreet worked with Anthony Ciampi in the aftermath of the devastating fire at the College of the Holy Cross, and addressed growing anti-Catholicism. Owing to violence from the Know Nothings, he forbade Jesuits from wearing their clerical attire in public or being addressed by their ecclesiastical titles. He later became president of Gonzaga College, where he oversaw the establishment and construction of St. Aloysius Church, of which he became the first pastor. In 1863, Stonestreet was involved in the legal incorporation of Boston College, and testified in court as to his knowledge of the conspirators in the assassination of President Abraham Lincoln, specifically Mary Surratt and Samuel Mudd. Later, he was assigned to Georgetown, parishes throughout Maryland and Washington, D.C., including as pastor of Holy Trinity Church in Georgetown, and Holy Cross, where he lived out his last years.  Early life and education  Charles Henry Stonestreet was born on November 21, 1813, in Port Tobacco in Charles County, Maryland. His father was a distinguished lawyer who intended for Charles to enter the legal profession. Charles attended a classical school run by Philip Briscoe in St. Mary's County, before enrolling in Georgetown University in Washington, D.C., where he graduated in 1833. There, he was a member of the Philodemic Society, and one of its founders, as he was among the group of students to sign the society's founding constitution in 1830. He delivered a speech at the 1830 commencement ceremony titled \\"The Claims of Aristotle on Posterity,\\" as well as one at the graduation ceremony of 1833 titled \\"On Ancient Literature.\\" Following his graduation, he entered the Society of Jesus on August 14, 1833. On July 28, 1835, Stonestreet officially received his Bachelor of Arts. While studying philosophy as a Jesuit scholastic, he taught French, mathematics, and grammar at Georgetown.  Early career  alt=Georgetown College campus between 1848 and 1854 Stonestreet then became a professor and prefect at Georgetown. As the prefects were only slightly older than the students among whom they enforced discipline, Stonestreet complained that the students were so disobedient that discipline would sometimes come to mutual blows between the prefect and students, comparing himself to a \\"prizefighter.\\" During this time, James Curley was working on establishing the Georgetown Astronomical Observatory. While working on acquiring all the instruments needed to outfit the building, he informed Stonestreet in the winter of 1841 that he would need to purchase a meridian circle. Stonestreet offered him the $2,000 () that his mother had bequeathed to him, which Curley used to obtain the instrument and begin using the observatory. On one occasion, Stonestreet was accompanying a group of thirty students on their annual vacation to St. Inigoes, Maryland. En route, their stagecoach overturned due to a reckless driver. All the passengers suffered only minor injuries, except Stonestreet, who was badly injured and sent back to Georgetown. On July 4, 1843, Stonestreet was ordained a priest. He was sent on a mission to Alexandria, Virginia, before being appointed president of St. John's Literary Institution in Frederick, Maryland, in 1848, where he remained until 1850. At the same time, he was assigned to St. John the Evangelist Church in Frederick, Maryland, as an assistant curate to Thomas Lilly. Shortly after, he became the pastor of St. John the Evangelist Church, and remained there for two years. During this time, he had three assistants, one of whom was Anthony F. Ciampi. Simultaneously, he took charge of St. John's Literary Institution that year, succeeding Lilly as president. His tenure at both the church and the school came to a close at the end of 1850, and he was succeeded by Thomas F. Mulledy.  Georgetown University  alt=Bust drawing of Charles H. Stonestreet Stonestreet assumed the Presidency of Georgetown University on August 1, 1851. In May 1852, he commemorated the landing of the Catholic pilgrims in the Maryland Colony by traveling to St. Inigoes, Maryland, with Bishops James Oliver Van de Velde of Chicago, Richard Pius Miles of Nashville, and John Baptist Mi√®ge of the Indian Territory East of the Rocky Mountains. During Stonestreet's tenure, the First Plenary Council of Baltimore was held at the college in 1852. This involved the arrival of twelve bishops, a mitred abbot, and two religious superiors. That year, the Medical Department participated in the commencement ceremony for the first time, awarding its first four medical doctorates. During this time, the Georgetown library saw significant growth, including almost 900 books that Stonestreet had shipped from Rome. This period of growth was so substantial that the library in Old North became filled to capacity, and Stonestreet sought to construct a larger facility. Administration of the university by the generally lax Stonestreet was praised by the provincial superior in a June 1852 report to the Jesuit Superior General. His placid demeanor was a stark contrast to that of his predecessor, James A. Ryder, and he was well liked by the faculty and students. Under his predecessors, enforcement of discipline in Catholic practices increased, and eventually, Catholic students were required to confess twice a month. Faced with a generally unruly student body, Stonestreet noted how the students least willing to obey authority were those raised in the slaveholding culture of the South, where they previously enjoyed great indulgence of their antics. The several Chilean students successfully petitioned to be relieved of the requirement's frequency. That August, he accepted an appointment as provincial superior of the Maryland Province of the Society of Jesus; Bernard A. Maguire was named as his successor.  Maryland provincial  The provincial superior of the Maryland Province of the Society of Jesus, Ignatius Brocard, died suddenly in the summer of 1852, and Stonestreet was named by the Superior General, Jan Roothaan, as his replacement, taking office on August 15. He was the first Marylander to hold the office who had not been trained in Rome. = Holy Cross disaster = alt=Fenwick Hall at the College of the Holy Cross in 1844 Stonestreet took office in the immediate aftermath of a disastrous fire at the College of the Holy Cross in Worcester, Massachusetts, on July 14, which destroyed the college's main building, Fenwick Hall, and most of its contents. The school's president, Anthony F. Ciampi, vowed to rebuild, while another influential Jesuit there, Joseph Aschwanden, was staunchly opposed to reopening the school. Stonestreet traveled to Worcester to mediate the controversy, and he reassigned the twenty Jesuits at the school, leaving only Ciampi and Peter J. Blenkinsop to attend to the ruined school and farm. Stonestreet discussed with Thomas Mulledy whether the Jesuit constitution allowed him to close the school, to which Mulledy responded that it did not. Stonestreet finally wrote to Roothaan, concluding that the school should be rebuilt, even if it meant assumption of much of the school's debt by the Jesuit province. Roothaan eventually delegated the decision on whether to rebuild to Stonestreet. = Management of Maryland = For many years, the Jesuit leadership had discussed establishing a scholasticate for the education of new Jesuits. They sought to separate it from Georgetown, which educated lay students as well as scholastics, and required that the scholastics teach alongside their studies. The new Superior General, Peter Beckx, proposed in 1855 that Georgetown be transformed into such a scholasticate for training all the Jesuits in the United States, and cease educating lay students. Stonestreet objected to this proposal and eventually, the focus turned to establishing a dedicated scholasticate elsewhere. Stonestreet responded to increasing anti-Catholicism in Maryland, specifically the allegation that the Jesuits swore an oath to the pope to overthrow the United States, by writing a letter to local newspapers in February 1855 in which he described his patriotic pride and attachment to his childhood home on the Western Shore of Maryland. As the Know Nothing movement grew in anticipation of the 1856 presidential election, so did Stonestreet and the other Maryland Jesuits' worries; Stonestreet wrote to Rome in the spring of 1856 that they were in the midst of a crisis. Due to the violence of the 1840s and 1850s perpetrated by the Know Nothings, he forbade Jesuits from wearing their clerical attire in public or be addressed by their ecclesiastical titles, instead using secular styles of address such as \\"doctor\\" instead of \\"father.\\"  Gonzaga College and St. Aloysius Church  alt=Early 20th-century negative of St. Aloysius Church and Gonzaga College Upon the selection of Burchard Villiger as the provincial superior of the Maryland province, Stonestreet succeeded him as president of the Washington Seminary on April 25, 1858. Stonestreet petitioned Congress to grant the school its own congressional charter. Very shortly thereafter, on May 4, 1858, President James Buchanan signed into law the bill independently chartering the Washington Seminary, and recognizing the institution by its new name of Gonzaga College. With this charter came the school's independence from Georgetown University, under whose authority it previously conferred degrees; accordingly, ownership of school's property was transferred from Georgetown to Gonzaga. The school especially credited Representative Richard Henry Clarke with seeing the bill through Congress. The following day, Stonestreet officially declared that Washington Seminary had ceased to exist, and had been replaced by Gonzaga College, though it remained common parlance to refer to the school as the Old Seminary for some time. The school did not exercise its power to confer degrees until 1868, when the first four students completed their studies. As president of Gonzaga, Stonestreet led the opening prayer of the House of Representatives on January 24, 1859, and of the Senate on February 9, 1859. During his term, the school's literary society, which had been founded in 1855, was renamed the Phocion Society, and Stonestreet was considered its founder. While president of Gonzaga College, Stonestreet oversaw the establishment and construction of St. Aloysius Church, which would be staffed by Jesuit priests whose service was no longer needed at the diocesan St. Patrick's Church. The church, designed by fellow Jesuit Benedict Sestini, was dedicated in November 1859; at its dedication, Archbishop John Hughes and James Ryder delivered sermons. In 1860, he sent his resignation as president of the school to the Jesuit Superior General, relinquishing the presidency as well as his pastorate of St. Aloysius Church. William Francis Clarke was appointed as his successor.  Civil War era and aftermath  Brady-Handyalt=Photograph of Charles H. Stonestreet seated Following his term at Gonzaga College, Stonestreet was appointed prefect of schools and a professor of rhetoric at Georgetown. During the Civil War, the Jesuit superiors ordered the Jesuits at Georgetown to remain publicly neutral with respect to the two belligerents. However, the majority of Jesuits and students at the school were aligned with the Confederacy; members of Stonestreet's family fought in the war for the South. He also became the Jesuit procurator to the superiors in Rome. Stonestreet served on the board of directors of Georgetown from 1861 to 1862 and from 1863 to 1864, as well as during his time as president of the university. On March 31, 1863, the Massachusetts General Court incorporated Boston College. Stonestreet was named in the charter as one of five Jesuits who were the officers of the corporation. In 1864 and 1865, he ministered to the mission church congregation of St. Mary's in Hagerstown, Maryland. = Trial of the Lincoln conspirators = In 1865, Stonestreet testified in the trial of the conspirators in the assassination of President Abraham Lincoln. He stated that he had known Mary Suratt, a parishioner of St. Aloysius Church, for more than 20 years and that while he had only infrequently seen her in the past 14 years, he had never known her to espouse treason. This testimony occurred against the backdrop of growing suspicion of Catholics, as several suspects proved to be Catholics; some who were suspicious of Catholics went so far as to accuse the Catholic Church of involvement in the assassination. He was also called to testify about Samuel Mudd, the physician who attended to John Wilkes Booth's fractured leg. He asserted that in 1850, Mudd was a student at St. John's Literary Institution, during Stonestreet's presidency of the school, and that he did not know whether Mudd remained at the school during the Christmas vacation of December 1850. = Later years = Stonestreet returned as a parish priest to St. John the Evangelist Church in Frederick in the late 1860s. When the president of Gonzaga College and rector of St. Aloysius Church, Bernardin F. Wiget, fell ill in 1868, Stonestreet was temporarily again appointed to the two offices, until August 1869 when James Clark became the permanent replacement. While the health of Bernard Maguire, the president of Georgetown, worsened in 1869, Stonestreet was considered again as president. The new provincial superior, Joseph Keller, decided against the nomination, due to his age; instead, John Early was appointed. Stonestreet became the pastor of Holy Trinity Catholic Church in Georgetown in 1870, where he remained for four years. Finally, Stonestreet was made spiritual father at the College of the Holy Cross in 1880. Before long, his health deteriorated around 1883, and he died on July 3, 1885.

Bar-sur-Seine is in the south of Champagne in the upper right quadrant. The county of Bar-sur-Seine was a compact lordship in France during the Middle Ages. Its seat, Bar-sur-Seine, lies on a Gallo-Roman site, but is only attested from the ninth century. It became of strategic importance in the twelfth century, as an urban centre and major castle on the road between Burgundy and Champagne. The first clear evidence that Bar-sur-Seine was regarded as a county comes from the late eleventh century. The castle belonged to the counts of Tonnerre until it was inherited by Eustachia, daughter of Milo III of Tonnerre. She married Walter I, Count of Brienne, and he took to titling himself \\"Count of Brienne and Bar-sur-Seine\\". In 1085, their third son, Milo II, inherited both the castle of Bar and the title of count. It is only at this juncture that a distinct county of Bar-sur-Seine emerges. Milo II was able to pass on the county undivided to his eldest son, Guy, in 1125 after his second son, Raynaud, entered the church and his third son, Herbert, married the heiress of the lordship of Ville-sur-Arce. Guy likewise passed on an undiminished county to his eldest son, Milo III. He died in 1151 only a year after his marriage to Agnes, heiress of Braine and Baudement. His heir was their only child, the infant Petronilla. Her uncle, Manasses, a cleric, ruled the county in her name until her marriage to Hugh of Le Puiset in 1168. Hugh ruled the county for the next twenty-one years, first in the name of his wife and from 1174 in the name of their son, Milo IV. Initially, the county, like the castle, was a fief of the Bishop and Duke of Langres. Milo II and his successors entered the orbit of the counts of Champagne in part out of desire to distance themselves from the bishop, their overlord. In the 1170s under Hugh of Le Puiset the county transferred its fealty from the bishop to the count of Champagne. By 1201, under Milo IV, it was considered one of the \\"great fiefs\\" of Champagne. The death of Milo IV and his only son, Gaucher, at the Siege of Damietta in 1219 sealed the county's fate. His widow, Helisent of Joigny, inherited the castle and her dower while the rest of the county went to Milo's nephews and nieces. Unusually, the county of Bar-sur-Seine was reassembled by Count Theobald IV of Champagne. He purchased the shares that went to Milo's relatives in 1223‚Äì24 and then those of Helisent and the community property in 1225. In 1227 he reorganized it as a castellany of the county of Champagne.

Jani Leinonen (born 22 March 1978 in Hyvink√§√§) is a Finnish visual artist. Leinonen is known for his public artworks criticising capitalism by using the imagery and icons of corporate brands. He graduated from the Helsinki Academy of Fine Arts in 2002.  Artworks and controversies  In January 2011, Leinonen led a group calling themselves the \\"Food Liberation Army\\". The group stole a life-size statue of Ronald McDonald from a Helsinki McDonald's restaurant, and posted videos on their website threatening to \\"decapitate\\" the clown if McDonald's would not answer questions about its ethics. However, McDonald's refused to \\"negotiate with criminals\\", and the Finnish police raided Leinonen's home, arresting two people and seizing cell phones and computers. In June 2014, Leinonen's Budapest pop-up installation \\"Hunger King\\" criticized Hungary's law that banned homeless people from sleeping in public areas. The installation imitated a Burger King restaurant. In December 2014, a Tokyo gallery removed Hello Kitty and Doraemon-branded shoes that were a part of Leinonen's exhibition satirising copyright laws. In 2015, Leinonen was one of the artists invited to the temporary art project Dismaland organised by street artist Banksy. In January 2019, Leinonen's artwork \\"McJesus\\", a crucified Ronald McDonald, caused a riot in Haifa, Israel. Hundreds of Christian protesters gathered by the Haifa Museum of Art throwing stones to the police, as they were blocked from entering the museum to remove the statue. Leinonen stated that he asked the Museum to remove it in September 2018 but his request was denied, and his art piece is now being used against his will. The Museum staff contacted Leinonen prior to opening the exhibition, asking for the work, and was referred by him to the Zetterberg Gallery, which owns the work. The gallery loaned the statue to the museum. It was reported that after Leinonen's request for its removal, the museum contacted the owning gallery and received approval to continue exhibiting the artwork.

Although similar to Philydrosaurus in its proportions and postcranial characters, it is distinct in retaining several apparently plesiomorphic characters, including a short snout, paired external nares and an open lower temporal fenestra.  Description  The skeleton was small, about 20.3 cm (8.0 inches) in length, not including the tail. The tail is incomplete, but including its estimated length, the total length of the skeleton would have been closer to 40.0 cm (15.7 inches). Coeruleodraco had a generalized, lizard-like body type. This is similar to some early choristoderes (like Cteniogenys, Philydrosaurus, and Lazarussuchus), but contrasts with other choristodere body types including long-necked forms such as Hyphalosaurus, and gharial-like forms such as Champsosaurus and other neochoristoderes. The skull had a short, pointed snout with about 38 teeth on each side (a low number by choristodere standards). It also had two nares (nostril holes). While paired nares are standard in most reptile groups, almost all other choristoderes (except Lazarussuchus) typically have one single hole in the skull for the nostrils, making Coeruleodraco's retention of paired nares a plesiomorphic (\\"primitive\\") feature relative to most other choristoderes. In common with other choristoderes, Coeruleodraco has elongated prefrontal bones which meet each other at the top of the snout, separating a pair of small, triangular nasal bones in the process. The nasals are so reduced in size (especially compared to Philydrosaurus) that they are completely surrounded by the prefrontals and premaxillary bones, and fail to contact the toothed maxillary bones. The postorbital and postfrontal bones (which lie behind the eye) are separate from each other; in many other choristoderes these bones fuse into a single postorbitofrontal bone. The rear of the skull is not particularly unusual, with each side of the skull having two holes known as temporal fenestrae (as with other diapsids). The upper temporal fenestra is not elongated (unlike neochoristoderes), but the lower temporal fenestra is low and long. The rear edge of each upper temporal fenestra was formed by the squamosal bone, which was ornamented with small spines. The postcranial skeleton was very similar to that of Philydrosaurus. The neck was short, and its vertebrae had low, swollen neural arches (upper portions). There were six or seven vertebrae in the neck, 16 in the torso, three in the hip, and more than 24 in the tail, which is incomplete. Vertebrae were longer than high, and the neural arches were completely fused to the centra (lower, spool-shaped portions), in contrast to the condition in neochoristoderes. Vertebrae at the base of the tail were fused to fan-shaped ribs which projected straight out. Further down the tail, these ribs became shorter and rectangular. The humerus was robust, with a roughly-textured knob above the large entepicondyle. The plate-like ischium bone (which formed the rear lower part of the hip) had a distinct triangular prong along its rear edge. Classification A group of phylogenetic analyses recovered Coeruleodraco as one of the earliest diverging members of a group of small-bodied Eurasian choristoderes. This group was likely a clade according to the parsimony analysis, in which case it was the sister taxon of the gharial-like neochoristoderes, although its monophyly is more uncertain under the bootstrap analysis. The only known genus of choristodere which diverged earlier than Coeruleodraco was Cteniogenys, which acquired a few specialized features independently of other choristoders.

Although the agreements proved controversial owing to great one-time and continuous financial and other burdens the agreements put on the Croatian state (relative to the Croatian government budget), no government of Croatia ever attempted to amend them. From the perspective of international law, these agreements may be seen as unjust to Croatia because of putting obligations chiefly on the Croatian state, but not on the Holy See. A 2012 analysis concludes that the Croatian state has to give about 1000 million HRK annually to the Catholic church. Another analysis counts 8670 million HRK as the minimal possible amount that the Church got from the Croatian government budget from 1996 to the end of 2013. Because of the principles of religious equality in the Croatian Constitution, the agreements between the Republic of Croatia and the Holy See resulted in comparable benefits being given to some other religious organizations, too. The budget for support to religious communities in the 2017 government budget was 300 million HRK. Description These treaties are distinct from but related with the contracts between the Croatian government and the Croatian Bishops' Conference (HBK - Hrvatska Biskupska Konferencija in Croatian), the governing body of the Catholic church in Croatia. The treaties especially \\"The agreement between the Holy See and the Republic of Croatia on cooperation in areas of upbringing and culture\\" and \\"The agreement between the Holy See and the Republic of Croatia on economic matters\\" left issues for further agreement between the Government and HBK. The concordats were challenged on constitutional grounds, but the Constitutional Court of Croatia judged itself unable to rule on matters of international law. Although the treaties arguably conflict with the Croatian Constitution, they are unenforceable, as they only specify that disputes will be resolved through negotiation.  Agreements  On 18 December 1996 the following three agreements were signed between the Holy See and the Republic of Croatia: = Care of the spiritual needs of Catholic believers and members of the armed and police forces = Officially known in Croatian as \\"Ugovor izmeƒëu Svete Stolice i Republike Hrvatske o du≈°obri≈æni≈°tvu katoliƒçkih vjernika, pripadnika oru≈æanih snaga i redarstvenih slu≈æbi Republike Hrvatske\\", this concordat obliges the Croatian state to integrate institutions of Catholic military chaplaincy in the Croatian military. It was ratified by the Croatian Parliament on 24 January 1997. = Cooperation in areas of upbringing and culture = Its name in Croatian is \\"Ugovor izmeƒëu Svete Stolice i Republike Hrvatske o suradnji na podruƒçju odgoja i kulture\\" and it was ratified by the Croatian Parliament on 24 January 1997. The agreement sets up Catholic religious education as a subject in all schools in Croatia and enables the Catholic church in Croatia to found and run official schools and institutions of higher education with state financing. Catholic institutions of higher education should by the agreement have the power to award academic and professional grades and degrees recognised under Croatian law. About 300 million HRK is spent per year on teachers of religious education. = Legal matters = Known in Croatian as \\"Ugovor izmeƒëu Svete Stolice i Republike Hrvatske o pravnim pitanjima\\", it was ratified by the Croatian Parliament on 7 February 1997. * It obliges the Croatian courts to notify Church authorities before investigating clerics for felonies, * gives the priest-penitent privilege (meaning the courts are forbidden from inquiring into confessional communication between priest and penitent), * gives local bishops the authority to veto church building plans, * guarantees the Church access to state television programming, etc. = Economic matters = Another agreement, called \\"Ugovor izmeƒëu Svete Stolice i Republike Hrvatske o gospodarskim pitanjima\\", was signed on 9 October 1998 and ratified on 4 December 1998. * Donations to the Church must be tax-free. * The Church will be returned all property that was taken from it during Communist Yugoslavia, or, if returning the property is not possible, the Church will be recompensated for that property. * The Church will be given an annual (monetary) amount based on the number of parishes. * The Church will be treated as a charitable organization tax-wise.  Opposition to the Treaties within Croatia  Ivan Grubi≈°iƒá, a Catholic priest and a member of the Croatian Parliament fought for termination or revision of the Treaties, which were deemed to unbalance the relations between the Church and the Croatian state.

Hulbe and constructed in 1940 by round-log artists John Heillila and Gust Lapinoja. Logs for the cabin are peeled Engelmann spruce with full dovetail notch and oakum chinking. Inside paneling on office walls includes yellow pine, white pine, and western red cedar, and all of the wood came from Idaho forests and was donated by lumber companies with business interests in Idaho. The building was added to the National Register of Historic Places in 1997. With History In 1907 legislators in Idaho began to consider creation of a state forester who would be responsible for public safety and policy enforcement in Idaho's forests. Legislation again was considered in 1921 and in 1924, and finally in 1925 the legislature approved a bill establishing the position of state forester. Ben E. Bush, an agent of the state land board, became the first state forester in Idaho, and he served until 1933. Bush was also the brother in law of Senator Borah. Although the state forester's office had been established in Coeur d'Alene, a second office was opened in 1935 in the Capitol Building in Boise. The Capitol office was open only while the legislature was not in session, and when Franklin Girard became state forester, his Boise office moved eight times in three years. As a result of frequent relocations, Girard established the Idaho State Forester's Building in 1940. The cabin required 44 logs, each 55 feet long and one-foot diameter, and after the logs were cut and set, the cabin walls were given time to cure to prevent warping. Most of the materials were donated, and the Civilian Conservation Corps provided most of the labor. The cabin was occupied in 1940 by the state forester's office, later the State Forestry Department, and it provided office space for the Soil Conservation Corps until 1990, when the building was acquired by the City of Boise. A lease agreement with the city allowed the Log Cabin Literacy Center, later known as The Cabin, to hold meetings at the building in 1995 until the present. Boise Public Library Expansion In 1973 the main library of the Boise Public Library system renovated and occupied the Salt Lake Hardware Company warehouse adjacent to the Idaho State Forester's Building. In 2018 a proposed expansion of the main library included a plan either to demolish or to move The Cabin. In November, 2018, the Boise city council voted to move The Cabin to Julia Davis Park to allow room for expansion of the library.

He was noted for engravings on type metal that could be set up with letterpress for book illustrations, and was also known as a mezzotint artist. Life One of the seven Raphael Cartoons in Kirkall's 1722 mezzotint edition Born in Sheffield, Kirkall was son of a locksmith. Around 1702 he came to London, and found employment in the book trade. He also studied drawing at Great Queen Street Academy. Kirkall married early in life, to Elizabeth; a second wife was called Deborah. He died in Whitefriars in December 1742, leaving a son, Charles, then aged about 22. Works As a book illustrator, Kirkall used etching and metalcut, with line engraving as \\"white line\\". From his first times in London, book ornaments he provided as raised metal proved very popular with publishers. In the 1720s he innovated with use of the mezzotint rocker tool to simulate chiaroscuro. A reputation for wood engraving was apparently based on misapprehensions, and the attribution to him of woodcuts in Samuel Croxall's edition of √Üsop's Fables (1722) was guesswork. Works included: * The frontispiece to William Howell's Medulla Histori√¶ Anglican√¶ (1712); * Plates for Michel Maittaire's edition of the works of Terence (1713); * Plates for the Tonson & Watts translation of Ovid's Metamorphoses (1717); * Plates for Nicholas Rowe's translation of Lucan's Pharsalia (1718); and * For Richard Bradley's The Gentleman and Gardener's Kalendar (1718). His mezzotint engravings were often printed in green ink, and occasionally printed √† la poup√©e in a variety of colours. In this manner he published by subscription sixteen views of shipping by William Van de Velde the younger, the seven Raphael cartoons, hunting scenes by Johann Elias Ridinger, and other works. Chiaroscuro woodcut portrait of Sir Christopher Wren With his new method of chiaroscuro engraving, Kirkall produced a copy of Ugo da Carpi's chiaroscuro engraving of √Üneas and Anchises, after Raphael, and a number of reproductions of drawings by Italian masters. In a similar manner he engraved a portrait of Sir Christopher Wren by John Closterman, in an architectural frame designed by Henry Cook; and a portrait of William Stukeley for whose antiquarian works he engraved standard copperplates. Later plates for the booksellers included: * Those for Oldsworth and others' translation of Homer's Iliad (B. Lintot, 1734); * Alexander Pope's translation of the same work (B. Lintot, 1736); * The plates to an edition of Inigo Jones's Stonehenge (1725); and * For James Gibbs's A Book of Architecture (1728), 73 plates. A portrait by Kirkall of Eliza Haywood, prefixed to her Works in 1724, earned for him a couplet in Pope's Dunciad. After William Hogarth published in 1732 his major set of engravings The Harlot's Progress, Kirkall made free copies in mezzotint, printed in green, and published from his house in Dockwell's Court, Whitefriars, in November of that year. Other engravings by Kirkall included: * A mezzotint portrait of Senesino the singer, after Joseph Goupy; * A set of thirty plates of flowers after Jacob Van Huysum; * Plates of shipping after Thomas Baston; and * Mezzotint plates after Peter Monamy.

During World War I, she served as Chief Medical Officer of two units of the Scottish Women's Hospitals for Foreign Service. She cared for the wounded in Serbia, France, and the Thessaloniki Front. In 1921, during her stay in Serbia, she founded the country's first children's hospital. While she is remembered as a national hero in Serbia, she was criticized by some for providing her expertise in Serbia rather than in her own country. Her honors include several medals, plaques, and a postage stamp. Early years and education Katherine Stewart MacPhail was born in Glasgow on 30 October 1887, the third of four daughters of Jesse PacPhail and Dr Donald MacPhail, a doctor. MacPhail was the only daughter in the family who showed an interest in her father's work. As a young girl, she entered the father's office and watched him examine the patients or treat wounds; she also went with him to visit patients on remote farms. In addition, her decision to dedicate her life to medicine was probably influenced by her uncles who were successful doctors: James led the missionary hospital in India, and Alex was a professor of anatomy at the University of Glasgow. MacPhail and her siblings' were initially home schooled by private teachers. Once they were old enough they attended the distant elementary school in Coatbridge, going on to study at Hillhead Academy in Glasgow. All four children successfully completing their studies at the Academy, and later at the University of Glasgow. At that time in Scotland, it was unusual for women to study at all, and especially medicine. Of the well-educated womeny from reputable families, they expected only to lead the household well and deal with art. Probably for this reason, her father was against his MacPhail's desire to study medicine. However, she had already demonstrated decisive determination and persistence, and he could not stand in the way of her decision. Her parents understood the importance of education, and on 26 April 1906 she enrolled to study medicine at the University of Glasgow. She was an excellent student, ane received numerous awards for her studies. She graduated on 12 October 1911 with an MB ChB from University of Glasgow Medical School. MacPhail began her medical career at the Glasgow Royal Infirmary in Glasgow, and she was also an assistant doctor at her father's clinic. World War I =Scotland, 1914= When World War I broke out, MacPhail decided to volunteer for active service in the British Army and sent a letter to the Ministry of War requesting to do so. The answer was fast, declining her request and explaining that the Royal Army Medical Corps did not accept women. She turned to the Red Cross, and received a similar response, as it too did not accept female doctors. She contacted Dr Elsie Inglis, who was recruiting women doctors and other medical staff for a women's volunteer medical units. Dr Inglis offered her hospital team to the British Ministry of War, but was rejected by the sentence: \\"My dear lady, go home and sit still.\\" Dr Inglis then sent letters to the embassies of France, Belgium, Russia and Serbia, who accepted this offer immediately and with gratitude. From then, she began active work for the Scottish Women's Hospitals for Foreign Service which affiliated itself with the suffrage movement. As the units for France and Belgium had already been filled, MacPhail was in a dilemma whether to go to Serbia, which was little known in the United Kingdom at that time. MacPhail later said: \\"I really hardly knew where Serbia was, but from what I read, I knew it was very difficult for them.\\" MacPhail accepted the offer and joined as the youngest in a group of 30 women who comprised the staff of the first unit of the Scottish Women's Hospital in Serbia. Her sister Isabel accompanied her to function as an orderly. =Serbia, 1915= In mid- December 1914, MacPhail's group boarded a transport boat in Southampton. On the way to Malta, most members of the unit spent time learning Serbian. Immediately after Christmas, they boarded the ship \\"Nile\\", which sailed to Piraeus. They arrived in Thessaloniki on 1 January 1915, and the next day boarded a train for Kragujevac, which was the headquarters of the Serbian army and military medical team. Though she was a junior doctor, she felt her skills were not being used appropriately. In the year 1915, an epidemic of typhoid fever emerged among the Serbian army. In June 1915, when the epidemic was in decline, MacPhail became seriously ill with a severe form of the infection. Her hearing was damaged long-lasting high temperatures, and she lost her hair, so covered wore a hat or a scarf for a long time. When she was healed, on the insistence of Admiral Ernest Troubridge, she left Serbia and returned to Scotland in order to recover completely. She reached Scotland in September 1915. =France, 1916= As soon as she had recovered sufficiently, MacPhail contacted the Serbian Support Fund in London and began a campaign to help the organization. She traveled all over Scotland, attended charity meetings and held lectures about her experiences in Serbia, appealing for help for the country. As she was unable to return to Serbia, which at the time was behind enemy lines, in January 1916, she joined the charity \\"Friends\\", which worked in France. She worked at Shalona in Marni, in the Champagne region, northeast of Paris. In April 1916, she was offered a job in Corsica, and in May 1916, arrived in Bastia to work at a hospital. A few days after her arrival she went to Ajaccio, visiting a Scottish Women's Hospital. There, she met with several acquaintances she knew from Serbia, and they told her what was happening to their old unit. Finding that there were opportunities to return to Serbia, she interrupted her stay in Corsica, in order to try to organize the accommodation of Serbian orphans in the \\"Friends\\" home in the High Savai. Unfortunately, this failed. \\"Friends\\" took over a hotel in Samoan, about from the Swiss border, and turned it into a refugee camp. At the end of September 1916, MacPhail took over the duties of a doctor in this home. During her stay in France, Dr. Sondermayer, chief of the Sanitary Department of the Serbian Army, offered her a place in a hospital and MacPhail, immediately accepted the offer. =Serbia, 1917= In the early spring of 1917, MacPhail was on the Thessaloniki front. In Thessaloniki, MacPhail located her younger sister, Isabel, who arrived there earlier with the Scottish Women's Hospital. Dr Sondermayer offered MacPhail and Isabel an opportunity to work in a newly formed large hospital, which France provided to the Serbian army, named the Serbian Hospital of Crown Prince Alexander. A few days later, they received an invitation from the head of the Serbian Relielf Fund in Thessaloniki to come to their hospital in Soroviƒá (today the Greek town of Amyntaio, near the Greek-Macedonian border) to help care for the injured civilian population during the bombing of Bitola and the surrounding area. MacPhail and Isabel as well as two other nurses and a cook were sent to the village of Brod, on the south-eastern side of the Bitola area. Isabel soon left Brod and returned to Thessaloniki to work in the Serbian hospital of Crown Prince Alexander, while MacPhail remained behind. At the end of the year, she traveled to Thessaloniki, returning to Brod with a serious illness. She was sure that it was a disease that was caused by long-term poor nutrition, and later it was identified as pellagra, then a little-known disease caused by a diet insufficient in vitamins. At the end of 1917, the hospital of the Serbian Support Fund was moved from Soroviƒá to Germijan near Brod, where MacPhail's outpatient clinic was closed to this village. At the same time, she approached her deadline to report to her post at the Serbian Hospital of Crown Prince Alexander in Thessaloniki. MacPhail was firmly convinced that her medical help was far more needed in the villages, so she managed to persuade Dr Sondermayer to let her remain in Bitola. At that time, MacPhail was visited by her friend, Dr Edward W. Ryan, whom she showed the poor living conditions in the nearby villages. Seeing this, Ryan immediately began collecting aid through the American Red Cross, and managed to obtain a mobile outpatient unit, which was supplied with drugs and food supplies so that MacPhail could expand her work to improving the nutrition of vulnerable children. During the winter of 1917/18, MacPhail was invited to a celebration where she first saw and met Crown Prince Alexander. In the Macedonian mountains, conditions were harsh and cold, but MacPhail with her mobile outpatient unit visited the surrounding villages regularly and did her job. In the meantime, her family and friends in Scotland collected warm clothes and footwear which Katherine shared with impoverished women and children. =Scotland, 1918= In the summer of 1918, MacPahil returned to Scotland for a short time to assist her father, Dr Donald MacPhail, who was working alone attending to patients who had contracted Spanish flu. When he contracted the flu, MacPhail and Isabel left, and the responsible parties accepted their reasons. MacPhail was distinguished by the Order of St. Sava IV class and the Medal of the Serbian Red Cross, while Isabel received the Cross of Mercy. In August 1918, the sisters MacPhail left Thessaloniki and returned to their native Scotland. In Scotland, MacPhail cared for her sick father and some of his patients. On 15 August 1918 MacPhail became an honorary citizen of Coatbridge, and at a special ceremony received the town's charter, and a gold watch. MacPhail followed news of the offensives on the Tessaloniki front and the allies breakthrough in September 1918. Interwar period = Return to Serbia= At the end of November 1918 MacPhail returned to Serbia. Clothing, footwear and other supplies to help Serbia, were collected by her family, friends and patients, were packaged and sent separately via the Red Cross. From London, MacPhail traveled to Paris and Toulon where she waited to board a ship to Dubrovnik. At that time Tulon was then crowded with refugees from Serbia, soldiers and civilians trying to return home. In Toulon she met Darinka Grujic, who had been taking care of Serbian orphans and refugees in France since the beginning of the war, which she wanted to return to Serbia. After several days waiting in Toulon, she embarked for Dubrovnik,then traveled for 3 days to Sarajevo, Zemun and finally Belgrade. After her arrival in Belgrade MacPhail applied to the Ministry of the Interior and was granted permission to stay to carryout charity work. First Children's Hospital in Belgrade At the beginning of 1919, she opened the first children's hospital in Belgrade. This was facilitated by Darinka Grujic securing five military barracks in Studenicka Street, near the Military Hospital, and giving one of the barracks to MacPhail to establish a children's hospital. British marines, led by Admiral Troubridge, cleaned, repaired and outfitted the barrack. A steriliser was installed along with 25 military beds, bedding, blankets and other supplies from Red Cross. Drugs and military supplies came from the American Red Cross. The Serbian Support Fund opened a charity kitchen for a nearby school, so MacPhail managed to arrange to supply this kitchen with food as well as for children at the hospital, while firewood was provided by the city government. Troubridge received many toys and Florence Harvey offered to provide a car for free. At the end of January 1919, the hospital received its first patients. During the first months of operation, every bed in the hospital was filled, and a large number of children attended the outpatient clinic. MacPhail performed all the medical work because there were few doctors as only about 100 had survived the war. Because of her work, MacPhail was popular in Belgrade, and was able to provide various types of assistance and donations for those who lacked financial means. Pavilion in Topƒçider By spring of 1919, the hospital was already too small in particular due to an increase in the number of children with tuberculosis. MacPhail learned that there was an empty and abandoned open pavilion that was previously used for children at Topƒçider, from Belgrade/ The pavilion was located on a hill, at the edge of a forest, so it was ideal for a treatment consisting of fresh air and sun, which, in addition to good food and rest, was at that time the only medicine for tuberculosis. MacPhail was granted a permit from the city government to arrange necessary repairs for the building and to procure equipment. By Easter 1919 the 40 bed pavilion received its first patients. It was managed by Mary Baker and soon proved to be successful with many children recovering. As an open pavilion it was only used in the summer months. It closed in 1924. Anglo-Serbian Children's Hospital Anglo-Serbian Children's Hospital surgical ward As the work expanded, MacPhail realized that the existing capacities would soon be insufficient for an increasing number of patients, especially because the top of the pavilion made it unusable in the winter, so she began to think about expanding the hospital. An enlarged building in Kneza Milosa Street, near the Military Hospital, was left empty when British marines left Belgrade and MacPhail immediately started the action to get that house for her hospital. It was a large, bright, well-built and preserved building that had enough space to accommodate 50 beds, especially when MacPhail succeeded in replacing large military beds for children's beds. In addition, a small operating room for easy surgical cases was formed, while severe surgical cases were sent to the state hospital. A large department for outpatient patients was also established. This new hospital began operating in November 1919, though it officially opened in February 1921. It was no longer an improvised institution, but a real medical institution. It was officially recognized by the Government of the Kingdom of Serbs, Croats and Slovenes as the first Children's Hospital in Serbia, called the Anglo-Serb Children's Hospital, abbreviated ASCH. It was the only children's hospital in what was now Yugoslavia. Shortly after the opening of this hospital, the Ministry of Health asked MacPhail to receive infants and newborns, so a special nursing department was also set up with treatment provided by the most experienced nurse. By 1921, MacPhail was hopeful to not only perfect this hospital, but to encourage the foundation of others and to train native nurses to work in them. =Dubrovnik= As the number of patients at Topcider had been steadily increasing, MacPhail came to the idea of finding a place on the seashore where she could accommodate children with tuberculous. She learned that there is a villa in Dubrovnik that would be ideal for this purpose. MacPhail contacted Zivojin Mi≈°iƒá who was then the head of the general≈°tab and whom MacPhail knew from the Thessaloniki front. When MacPhail explained to him that this villa in Dubrovnik should serve as a health center and a children's rest home, he immediately ordered the villa to be handed over to the English-Serbian children's hospital for further use. MacPhail's sister, Isabel, who was already doing volunteer work at the Children's Hospital in Belgrade, traveled to Dubrovnik to see the building and to try and find the equipment for her. While she was in Dubrovnik, Isabel heard of an abandoned Austrian hospital near Zelenika in Boka Kotorska and traveled there to see what it was about. To her surprise, she found a deserted but fully equipped hospital, with beds, bedding and other material, and a young Serbian officer who kept all of this with his soldiers. It was Vasa Srdi. He offered for Isabel to take everything she needed, and in addition, he immediately arranged shipping and transport of equipment to Dubrovnik. Isabel chose 60 beds together and other equipment and returned to Dubrovnik. As the building itself was well preserved, the hospital was established in February 1920. =Sremska Kamenica= In the early 1930s, a report was submitted regarding the Anglo-Serbian Children's Hospital stating that during the preceding two years, 115 hospital patients were hospitalized (hospitalization of some patients lasted up to 24 months), and 160 children were treated clinically, or outside the hospital. There were also 25 surgical procedures, 194 punctures and 113 X-ray imaging, and 84 immunizations with gypsum were performed. Fifty children left the hospital as successfully cured, 12 of them had improved health status during discharge, and the rest was on further treatment. The conclusion was that in spite of the small number of beds and a limited fund owned by the Anglo-Yugoslav hospital, she managed to fulfill all the tasks. The enormous costs of maintaining a hospital in Belgrade had become increasingly high year after year, and this, among other reasons, influenced MacPhail to start thinking about moving the hospital somewhere in the interior of the country, but not too far from Belgrade, which would be in open air with fresh air and sun. She even thought about buying one of the abandoned Fru≈°ka Gora monasteries. Darinka Grujic advised her to try to find a suitable building or to build a new building in Sremska Kamenica, which according to its natural conditions, was the most suitable place for this purpose. As MacPhail already had a holiday home in Sremska Kamenica, she immediately started making plans for the establishment of a new hospital. MacPhail's old friend, Eng. Vasa Srdiƒá had been an officer of the Serbian army in Zelenika in the early 1920s He had helped Isabel and subsequently became a great friend of the sisters MacPhail. After the war, as a graduate engineer of agronomy, he got land in Temerin, where he settled and was engaged in farming and fruit growing. Being aware of MacPhail's plans, he soon learned that on the hill ƒåardak, just above Sremska Kamenica, an old and abandoned vineyard was being sold which could suit MacPhail's plans. She was thrilled with the position of the city itself and its surroundings and bought the land, which was officially conveyed to her on August 1, 1933, and immediately began preparations for the construction of the hospital. According to Ketrin's idea and with the help of an engineer of the Hygienic Institute in Belgrade, an old Russian architect made plans for a three-winged building with a central courtyard and a long terrace along the north and west wing so that children can be in the sun all day. In the spring of 1934, the work on the new hospital was completed, all necessary equipment was ordered, and lists of patients scheduled to start treatment were compiled. The Royal Commission of the Danube Banovina approved the opening of the children's sanatorium. The building consisted of a main frontal area and two symmetrically situated wings. The main part consisted of three departments of the hospital, a patient unit, a workshop, a radiotherapy department, a pharmacy section, a space intended for patients with infectious diseases and rooms for the sterilization of instruments and appliances. Also, there was an area for the administration of the hospital, as well as a warehouse for medicines and instruments. In the wings of the buildingm there was a kitchen with a pantry and a dining room for children. On the first floor were four-room dormitories for doctors and nurses. There were also four bathrooms and toilets arranged in the wings of the building. The hospital was built in accordance with the needs of patients who anticipated a longer stay for treatment. There were terraces in front of the south and west wings. Even the courtyard was fenced and decorated like a park. The orchard and vineyard were also located within the yard. The principle treatment of bone and joint tuberculosis at the time when antibiotics and antituberculotics did not exist consisted of increasing the general resistance of patients with hygienic and dietary regimen, fresh air therapy, heliotherapy (exposure to the sun during the day, during the winter exposure to artificial light), immobilization and various surgical procedures. Special attention was also paid to hospital hygiene. School-age children attended daily classes that corresponded to their age and curriculum, after which they would receive a certificate at the end of the school year. The hospital also organized workshops that were part of the work therapy, where children attended art classes. Once a week, the Orthodox priest would come to provide the children with religious instruction. The hospital also had a library that was equipped with a large number of children's books, which were both educational and entertaining, and there were a handful of toys. English- Yugoslav Hospital for Treatment of Osteoarticular Tuberculosis was officially opened on September 23, 1934, under the auspices of Her Majesty Queen Maria Karaƒëorƒëeviƒá. The first patients were transferred from a Belgrade hospital as early as August 1. The treatment was focused on patients suffering from tuberculosis of the bones and joints, rachitis. The treatment consisted of fresh air, sun exposure, good food, rest, massage, immobilization with plaster and surgery if there was a need for it. The hospital received children under 14 years of age. During the year, there were up to 50 children, and over the winter, 32. The head of the hospital was MacPhail, the main surgeon was Svetislav Sojanoviƒá, the main nurse was Agnes Hardy, and Alice Murphy was a secretary. Among the staff, there were two other nurses, one teacher and auxiliary staff. One of the main problems of the hospital was funding, because the children were mostly treated for free. The cost of the hospital was covered by many donors. Among the donors, there was also the Ministry of Social Affairs and Public Health of the Kingdom of Yugoslavia, the Child Protection Fund, as well as various other organizations. All of this was not enough to cover the cost of the hospital, so for this reason, MacPhail had to constantly run a fundraising campaign in order to keep the hospital in operation. In 1940, the situation in the region became serious and the sanatorium staff began to prepare with the military against an enemy attack. In February 1941, MacPhail had a plan to evacuate children from the hospital. Three weeks before the war, all children were sent from the hospital to their homes, and all the hospital equipment was packed and sheltered in the basements to be protected in the event of a bombing. The situation become very serious and the British Embassy advised all British citizens to leave the country. Not leaving in time, she and other British residents became the prisoners of the Germans before she was repatriated to Britain. Soon thereafter, 120 soldiers were placed in the hospital for anti-aircraft patrols. The building was soon turned into a local hospital. The hospital staff often helped the partisan movement in the form of providing medical care and food, which was one of the reasons why the hospital was attacked. After that, the building was abandoned and destroyed. During the war years, the hospital also used hostile forces for its soldiers. Post-WWII MacPhail came to Belgrade after the liberation in 1945. When she went to visit Sremska Kamenica, she encountered a building that was without a door and windows, empty and ruined. There was no longer any medical or electrical equipment in it. In July, MacPhail began negotiations over the reopening of a hospital in Sremska Kamenica with the help of the Child Protection Fund from London. The Ministry of Public Health of the Democratic Federative Yugoslavia gave permission to start the reconstruction on August 15. With the help of staff, MacPhail managed to procure medical equipment and medical supplies as well as other necessary things to carry out the operation. From humanitarian organizations from Canada and the United Kingdom came bedding and blankets. The complete equipment from the surgery was found in a military hospital in Sremski Karlovci and was soon returned. Katherine also received 46 boxes of clothes and bedding for children from friends. The complete repair of the hospital was financed by the Government of the Autonomous Welfare of Vojvodina, and the hospital was restarted on December 19, 1945. During the war, the number of children who suffered from tuberculosis increased. The hospital now operated with a capacity of 75 beds and was permanently filled. The working conditions were difficult at that time due to the lack of equipment and food, as the supply of the hospital was very difficult. During this period, the fruit trees and vineyards that were around the hospital were of great help. Soon, life and work at the hospital returned to normal. However, the new government slowly increased the amount of mistrust towards MacPhail and her associates. She proposed to the Ministry of Health to turn the hospital into a rehabilitation center for children with disabilities, as well as for children who became disabled due to tuberculosis or other illnesses. She also planned to build a workshop where adults with disabilities would help in the production of orthopedic aids. In 1947, the new regime decided to nationalize all hospitals and the Anglo-Yugoslav (Anglo-Serb.) Children's Hospital was handed over to the Yugoslav authorities in the autumn of that year. After nationalization, the hospital continued to exist as a state sanatorium for bone tuberculosis. The hospital in Sremska Kamenica became a state property and as such, was part of the Department of Orthopedic Surgery of the Medical Faculty in Belgrade, led by Professor Svetislav Stojanovic. Realizing that nothing could prevent the implementation of the communist regime, MacPhail returned to Scotland in 1949, settling in St Andrews. On 22 September 1954, to mark the 20th anniversary of the hospital's establishment, MacPhail visited the hospital in Sremska Kamenica and was warmly greeted warmly:‚Äî \\"The hospital looked like before, fresh, exposed to the sun and surrounded by rich vineyards. The children attended school classes, freshly-prepared meal awaited the children every day thanks to the staff from the kitchen.\\" A memorial plaque was placed in the entrance hall with the inscription that she was its founder. This memorial plaque was a great sign of gratitude for her contribution during the war. Apart from MacPhail, the ceremony were attended by Alice Marfi and Flora Sands. MacPhail died in St Andrews, 11 September 1974. Honors and legacy Postage stamp issued by Serbian Mail, 2015 During the World War I, MacPhail was distinguished by the Order of St Sava of the Fourth and Fifth degrees, and due to the humanitarian activities that followed the war, she received the Order of the Third Degree. Great Britain awarded her one of her greatest awards, the Order of the British Empire. When it was 1954, for the last time, she came to Serbia to visit her hospital in Sremska Kamenica on the occasion of twenty years since its founding, MacPhail became an honorary citizen of Sremska Kamenica and the lifelong president of the Karlovac Red Cross. In the courtyard of the hospital, two memorial plaques were placed in her honor, and on June 15, 1988, a monument in her honor was also erected. In December 2015, the Serbian Mail issued commemorative stamps in her honor in partnership with the British Embassy in Belgrade.

Biography  His father was a cooper. Despite objections from his parents, he was finally allowed, at the age of fifteen, to go to Z√ºrich, where he was apprenticed to the engraver, Georg Christoph Friedrich Oberkogler (1774‚Äì1855). Later, he studied portrait painting with Johann Rudolf Obrist (1809‚Äì1868). He then obtained the sponsorship of Ludwig Vogel who, in 1841, recommended him to Theodor Hildebrandt for his classes at the Kunstakademie D√ºsseldorf. There, he came under the influence of Hildebrandt, Friedrich Wilhelm Schadow and Carl Friedrich Lessing. Due to an unspecified nervous disorder, he had to quit the Akademie in 1844 and return home to recover.Bettina Baumg√§rtel, Sabine Schroyen, Lydia Immerheiser, Sabine Teichgr√∂b: Verzeichnis der ausl√§ndischen K√ºnstler und K√ºnstlerinnen.

Michael Imhof Verlag, Petersberg 2011, , Vol. 1, pg. 427. When he had improved, the government of Z√ºrich granted him a scholarship to study history painting in Munich. He moved there in 1845 and, due to the disturbances surrounding the Sonderbund War and its aftermath, he decided to stay. He would remain for the rest of his life, although he travelled extensively and often visited Switzerland on business.  Career  In 1847, he completed his first historical scene, depicting Hans Waldmann saying goodbye to his fellow prisoners. The painting was purchased by the Cantonal government of Z√ºrich and was displayed at a major exhibition of the (Artists' Association). He continued to create large historical scenes, primarily from the 16th century, but most of his income was derived from portraits. He had hoped to receive a major commission for decorations in the new Federal Palace of Switzerland but, in 1865, his proposals were rejected. As a result, in the early 1870s, he turned to genre painting and travelled throughout Tyrolia doing study sketches. In his final years, he became reclusive. After his death, his work was considered old-fashioned and was largely forgotten until a major retrospective was held for his centennial in 1987.

Commissioned by the Documentary Channel and Canal D, the film points out how film actors often become their roles and suggests these principles apply to ordinary people in terms of actualizing confidence, heroism, health and even love. Synopsis George Lakoff Gabor Mat√© Paul Ekman Amy Cuddy The film explores a new field of science called embodied cognition, with some of the leading researchers in the field including George Lakoff, Gabor Mat√©, Paul Ekman, Philip Zimbardo, and Harvard psychologist Amy Cuddy. The shorthand expression, \\"fake it till you make it\\", appears to ring true, though it can also backfire (people behaving overconfidently) and it also applies to undesirable outcomes (acting depressed and becoming depressed). A section of the film explores the \\"hack for love\\" as proposed by psychologist Robert Epstein, and features Madan Kataria, the inventor of laughter yoga. Production =Inspiration= Nerenberg noticed how many actors had performed acts of heroism, and began wondering if these actors were \\"practising\\" courage without realizing it. When he began researching the documentary, he saw there was an even more precise pattern: \\"Sure, many stars play heroes, but only some perform outstanding heroic acts in public. It was most often actors who do their own stunts, people likely into the physical culture of stunts and action.\\" Nerenberg has a background in acting himself:\\"I've always thought that, for me, learning acting was a really empowering experience... So I had always been interested in sort of the science of the way acting changes people.\\" Bill Brownstein remarks that Nerenberg first wrote about the idea in his Montreal Gazette column some eight years previously. =Financing= The film received funding from the Canada Media Fund. =Filming= Parts of the film were shot in Kingston, Ontario, where Nerenberg lives part-time. Release and reception You Are What You Act had its world premiere at the Illuminate Film Festival at the Mary D. Fisher Theatre in Sedona, Arizona on 1 June 2018. The film was selected for the inaugural Knowlton Film Festival in Lac-Brome, Qu√©bec and screened on 17 August 2018. The film was screened as part of the 11th Be The Change film series at Collingwood, Ontario, on 21 November 2018, at the Simcoe Street Theatre (where proceeds went to charity). The same month, it was shown at the Hot Docs Ted Rogers Cinema in Toronto on 29 November 2018 and at the Screening Room independent theatre in Kingston, Ontario on 30 November 2018.

The majority in the 5‚Äì2 decision struck down a passage in the Canada Elections Act which had limited the right to vote to \\"a person who has been absent from Canada for less than five consecutive years and who intends to return to Canada as a resident\\". Background Section 3 of the Canadian Charter of Rights and Freedoms (1982) states: This is subject to Section 1, which states: In May 1993, the government of Brian Mulroney amended the Canada Elections Act so that Canadians living abroad could vote in federal elections under the condition that they were: Those who returned to visit Canada within the five- year limit had this time reset, so that those who frequently returned to visit Canada maintained the right to vote from abroad. After Stephen Harper's government came to power in 2006, it began strictly enforcing the five-year limit, so that it never reset for those who visited Canada. The provisions in the act were challenged by Canadian citizens Gillian Frank and Jamie Duong. Both worked at universities in the United States, as they could not find suitable work in Canada. When they found they could not vote in the 2011 Canadian federal election, they pursued a case. The Justin Trudeau government introduced the Elections Modernization Act shortly before the Supreme Court's decision; the legislation restored expatriate voting rights, but left open whether future governments could take them away again.

Often one or both gonads is an ovotestis which contains both types of tissue. It is similar in some ways to mixed gonadal dysgenesis but the conditions can be distinguished histologically. The condition has several effects on the body, one of which is imbalanced hormonal output, which is why it is currently considered a disqualifying condition for military service in the United States. \\"Pseudohermaphroditism\\" on the other hand is an old clinical term for a person that is born with primary sex characteristics of one sex but develops the secondary sex characteristics that are different from what would be expected on the basis of the gonadal tissue (ovary or testis). Use of the term \\"pseudohermaphroditism\\" can be problematic, and is now widely considered redundant. Because of this, the language still used by the armed forces has fallen out of favor in the 21st century due to misconceptions and pejorative connotations associated with the term Hermaphrodite. Several militaries, whether they accept intersex people (such as Israel) or not, use different wording.Speckhard, Anna and Paz, Reuven; \\" Transgender Service in the Israel Defense Forces: A Polar Opposite Stance to the U.S. Military Policy of Barring Transgender Soldiers from Service\\" (2014); Academia.edu The website Military.com clumps all three conditions together as \\"hermaphroditism\\" on their list of conditions which disqualify one from service. History =Background= Barring of intersex persons with ovotesticular disorder of sex development and \\"pseudohermaphroditism\\" like states dates back to at least as far back as 1956. Despite this John F. Patton of the Office of the Surgeon General and Center of Military History of the U.S. Army, wrote in 1988 that \\"Lesser degrees of these abnormalities, however, were obviously overlooked or regarded as compatible with military service.\\"John F. Patton; Urology - Page 148 Mentions of gonadal agenesis as an obstacle in military servie has been recorded since the early 1970s if not before.Military Medicine; Association of Military Surgeons, United States, 1970 - Page 788-790 =Developments= The guideline with the current wording was first conceived in 2010 and implemented in 2011.Assessing the Implications of Allowing Transgender Personnel to Serve Openly - Page 65Sexual Assault in the U.S. Military: The Battle Within America's Armed - Page 87 At first it was not addressed if persons who have had surgeries to address their genital abnormalities were acceptable or not but later updates added in notes about people also being barred if they had medical interventions done. In 2013 guidelines stated that \\"a history of, or current manifestations of, personality disorders, disorders of impulse control not elsewhere classified, transvestism, voyeurism, other paraphilias, or factitious disorders, psychosexual conditions, transsexual, gender identity disorder to include major abnormalities or defects of the genitalia such as change of sex or a current attempt to change sex, hermaphroditism, pseudohermaphroditism, or pure gonadal dysgenesis or dysfunctional residuals from surgical correction of these conditions render an individual administratively unfit\\", which while specifying that only unsuccessful corrective surgeries for the conditions rendered someone unfit for service also lumped together disorders of sex development (DOSD) with gender identity, fetishes, mental illness, neuroatypicality, personality disorders and paraphilias in the same level of disqualification, which is not consistent or optimal for rules of enlistment. The 2016 amendments to the 6130.03 guidelines to allow transgender people to serve did not touch on intersex people whatsoever and their situation remained unchanged.Inclusion in the American Military: A Force for Diversity - Page 163 At the time the location of the writing was at \\"Enclosure 4, 14f. and 15r\\", here it was listed as \\"major abnormalit[y] or defect of genitalia\\".Inclusion in the American Military: A Force for Diversity - Page 154 The amendments made for transgender people were motivated by changes in the medical and psychological community, and while the use of the word hermaphroditism was criticized as archaic and medically outdated there was no major push by the larger LGBT community to have it corrected nor was any effort made on the part of the military to consider having it reworded. Effectiveness The Consensus Study Report from the Board on Children, Youth, and Families (part of the DOD's Military Family Readiness System) in 2019 notes that despite the restriction it is very possible for someone whose genitalia have been surgically modified to comply with social norms due to these conditions to enter the military completely undetected.

It is located around 4 miles away from Valsad city and 200 miles away from Mumbai. Height of hill from ground is around 500 ft. It has two entries one from Atul and one from Parnera.  History  As per known information, a Hindu king had made a fort on the hill. Upon inspection of the Fort's relics and structure use of skillful engineering methods of that time may be seen. The fort was under Dharampur state (called Ram Nagar state at that time) during the 15th century. Sultan Muhammad Shah Begda won this fort at the end of 15th century. In 16th century, portuguese of Daman seized and destroyed this fort in 1558 and 1568. After that, Chatrapati Shivaji maharaj raid on Surat in 1664 and 1670. That time, while moving back they had passed through the fort of Parnera Hill. That time, a huge war was happened here. Based on folktale, Chhatrapati Shivaji maharaj jumped away from a big hidden passage of the fort with his horse during this war. Hidden Passage from where Shivaji jumped away with his horse from the fort. In 1696, Commander of Chhatrapati Shivaji maharaj, Shree Moro Pandit took possession of fort and built military base. That time was era of Peshwa. But, Golden era of Peshwa completed slowly. In 1780, Fort come under the hand of Gayakwad government of Vadodara, then Peshwa Balaji Bajirao 3rd attacked on the fort. This fight ran up to 7 days. One poet has mentioned this fight's description in \\"Parnera ni lol\\" garba. In 1780, British Govt. took possession of fort under the leadership of Lt. Wales and put military for handling harassment of Pindharas. At the beginning of the 19th century, military was moved away from there. During 1857's rebellion, fort was demolished. Some relics of it still exists on Parnera Hill. There are three stepwells on Parnera Hill. Army, Commander used water of it during that time. There are still three cannon in broken fort. There were around 150 cannons in fort during Indian independence. Some of them are now in Valsad R.P.F. Ground.  Temples  There are three temples on the top of Parnera Hill: * Shree Maha Kali Mata Temple * Shree Chandika, Shree Ambika, Shree Navdurga, Shree Sheetla Mata and Hanumanji Temple * Swayambhu Rameshwar Mahadev Temple Shree Maha Kali Mata temple is situated on the top of Parnera Hill. In south direction of the fort, there is a big rock where cave is situated in it. Shree Maha Kali Mata statue is inside the cave. There is also one archaeological temple on the hill, where goddesses Shree Chandika, Shree Ambika, Shree Navdurga, Shree Sheetla Mata statues are in the temple. There is also temple of God Hanumanji in front of it. Swayambhu Rameshwar Mahadev temple is also located near this temple on the hill. Based on one folktale, five goddesses Shree Chandika, Shree Ambika, Shree Navdurga, Shree Sheetla and Shree Kalika was stayed with each other here. Because of some reason, Goddess Kalika became sad. Goddess Kalika was gone to the cave. Therefore, there are two temples on the hill. In every October, a huge fair is organized on Parnera Hill during Navratri.  Mosque  Chand Pir Baba Dargah is situated on the top of Parnera Hill. Pir was martyred in the fight of truth and non-violence. During fight, Pir's cut head fell down in Parnera and Pir's body fell down in Bilimora. In remembrance of Pir's sacrifice, Dargah were made in Parnera and Bilimora.

Her voice, a soprano of extraordinary breadth and agility, combined with skill as an actress and a pleasant appearance, made her very popular in the main cities of her country, where she was a favourite at festivals and concerts, as well as on stage.  Career  Minna Peschka-Leutner Born in Vienna, von Leutner was trained in opera by Heinrich Proch, Kapellmeister of the Viennese Theater in der Josefstadt. In 1856, she began her career in Breslau as Agathe in Der Freisch√ºtz. It was a great success, thanks to her light soprano voice, her natural taste and her stage intelligence.. From Breslau she moved to Dessau in 1857, became a member of the Hoftheaters Altes Theater, then went to Vienna, where she married the Viennese doctor Johann Peschka in 1861. In Vienna, she worked for two years with Anna Bochkoltz. In 1863, she made her debut as a guest at the Wiener Staatsoper, where she made a success as Marguerite in Les Huguenots, and where she sang successively Robert le Diable, Don Giovanni, The Magic Flute, L'Africaine and various other works. She sang a concert at Leipzig in the Gewandhaus that included the \\"Queen of the night\\"s arias from Mozart's The Magic Flute. She received such applause that Witte, the director of the Stadttheater of Leipzig immediately offered her a contract. She began on August 1, 1868 and continued to enjoy success in that theatre, particularly with her performance of the role of Ophelia in A.

Early life ≈ûadiye Sultan was born on 30 November 1886 in the Yƒ±ldƒ±z Palace. Her father was Sultan Abdul Hamid II, and her mother was Emsalinur Kadƒ±n, the daughter of √ñmer Bey and Selime Hanƒ±m. She was the ninth child, and fifth daughter of her father and the only child of her mother. ≈ûadiye Sultan's education took place in a study room in the Lesser Chancellery of the Yƒ±ldƒ±z Palace, together with her younger sister Ay≈üe Sultan. Their instructors were the privy secretary Hasib Efendi and the Private Enciphering Secretary K√¢mil Efendi. Hasib Efendi would give lessons in the Quran, Arabic, and Persian, while K√¢mil Efendi was to teach Turkish reading and writing, Ottoman grammar, arithmetic, history, and geography. Engagements On 31 March 1909, Abdul Hamid betrothed her to Ali Namƒ±k Bey, son of K√º√ß√ºk Said Pasha. At the overthrew of her father in 1909, the princess followed her father into exile at Thessaloniki. The next year she returned to Istanbul. However, the engagement was broken off because of Said Pasha's attitude against her father. Enver Pasha also asked her hand in marriage, but she overturned this proposal, because he was involved in the deposition of her father. Her engagement was then set with a son of Z√ºl√ºfl√º Ismail Pasha. He was congenial and handsome. However, then the government opposed the match. First marriage ≈ûadiye was betrothed to Fahir Bey, son of Mustafa Fazƒ±l Bey, and the grandson of Galib Pasha, the long-serving minister of pious foundations, rightly renowned for his uprightness and integrity. Fahir was an attractive, good-natured and well cultivated man. The marriage took place on 2 December 1910 in the Ni≈üanta≈üƒ± Palace.

Second marriage At the exile of the imperial family in March 1924, ≈ûadiye Sultan settled in Paris, where she married Re≈üad Halis Bey on 28 October 1931. In 1940, during ongoing World War II, the Germans invaded Paris, her husband, Re≈üad Bey, said to her, that they should leave France and settle somewhere else, but ≈ûadiye Sultan disagreed and said ‚ÄúFrance is my second home, I have live in comfort here, the disaster of France is my disaster, I would help the wounded soldiers. She was widowed at his death in November 1944. After the death of her husband, she moved to Hotel Saint-Honore, and took a room adjacent to her brother ≈ûehzade Abd√ºrrahim Hayri. Memoirs In 1966, ≈ûadiye Sultan published her memoirs under the title Hayatƒ±mƒ±n acƒ± ve tatlƒ± g√ºnleri (The bitter and sweet days of my life). The same year she gave an interview about the life of her father, to reporter Muzaffer Budak Seyfettinoƒülu from the magazine Yeni Istikal, whose 253rd issue was published on 15 June 1966.

We both have a common interest in moderating and modulating the Iranian military buildup, not because this administration wants to yield to congressmen who do not like the shah, not because the United States is unable to trust Iran with our most sophisticated weapons but because we have a national interest in insuring the stable and robust evolution of a strong and dependable ally.\\" \\"We do not want to simply deny the shah particular pieces of military equipment (and have him feel hurt, or turn elsewhere). Rather we want him to slow down and stretch out the buildup of his military forces to give him more time and more resources to build a cohesive, prosperous (and non-repressive) domestic base for his defense effort.\\" Despite wide circulation of this memo and extensive effort to elevate Moran‚Äôs analysis to those who could affect policy change, the United States continued along a path that favored appeasing Iranian weapons purchases to secure American military interests in the region. Over the following year, protests of the Shah‚Äôs regime grew more fervent, culminating in the massacre of protestors on Sep. 8, 1978, now known as Black Friday, and widely considered the tipping point in the Iranian Revolution. Moran was somewhat vindicated after details of his memo became public as part of a series of articles in the Washington Post by Scott Armstrong detailing US involvement in the demise of the Shah.

It is one of the oldest and arguably the second largest church in Asia by land area. History Oxford Mission Church Barisal In the early 18th century, the ancient river port city Barisal attracted many Christian missionaries. Oxford Mission, an England-based Anglican missionary started its journey in this region from at the end of the 19th century and formed Brotherhood of the Epiphany in 1895. In 1902, a Sisterhood was formed at Barisal under the guidance of Father Strong to work alongside the Brotherhood. The missionary opened an English boarding school, Christian youth hostels, an orphanage, a primary school and a medical centre in its compound at Bogra Road. The work of the sisters was very broad in scope, including evangelism, medical work, educational activity amongst women under the leadership of Edith Langridge. Later a branch house was formed at Jobarpar, Agailjhara thirty miles north of the town. The Epiphany Church was established in 1903 based on a sketch of Sister Edith and inaugurated on January 26 that year. Father E. L. Strong, chief of the brotherhood had overseen the completion of the church's design, final shape and construction through a second phase in 1907. Frederick Douglass served as the engineer. The church was built on 35 acres of land surrounded by high wall and rows of palm trees. The church has been preserved as a cultural heritage and survived many natural disasters occurred in the country. Architecture The structure of the church reflects Greek architectural style. It appears to be a five-storied building from the outside, it actually has a single floor with a large prayer hall. There are many doors on three sides, 40 archways and numerous corridors around the church. The large cross on the main altar was brought from Bethlehem, Palestine. The interior has been designed with wood carvings and the floor including the baptism bath basin decorated with marble tiles. Another notable attraction of the Oxford Mission Church is the red brick bell tower and the giant bell it houses. The bell is rung seven times every day five minutes before prayers. The bell tower also houses the church's office room. There are 13 small and large ponds and Oxford Mission High School, hospital, library, students' hostel and living quarters of the father and sisters inside the compound.

The brigade was composed of some 3,500 menJohn Hussey, Waterloo: The Campaign of 1815: Volume I: From Elba to Ligny and Quatre Bras, 1931 recruited to garrison the Dutch colonies in the West Indies (Surinam and the Dutch Antilles) and East Indies (the Dutch East Indies, present-day Indonesia). The troops were a mix of Europeans and soldiers native to the colonies, although all officers were European. The unit was under the command of Baron Lieutenant General Carl Heinrich Wilhelm Anthing, a German officer in Dutch service, and consisted of: * the 5th East Indies Regiment of the Line (Oost-Indisch regiment No. 5) under G.M.

However, soon after, Napoleon escaped from exile on Elba and in June 1815 launched the Waterloo Campaign. The Dutch scrambled their troops to defend against the French invasion, and the troops bound for the colonies were combined into a temporary Indies Brigade and placed under Baron Lieutenant General Carl Heinrich Wilhelm Anthing, commander of the Dutch East Indies force. During the Waterloo Campaign, the brigade formed part of II Corps under the British general Lord Hil. The unit was held in reserve and did not take part in either the Battle of Waterloo or the Battle of Quatre Bras. Allied commander-in-chief Arthur Wellesley, 1st Duke of Wellington positioned the brigade with the 1st Netherlands Division near the town of Halle.John Franklin, Waterloo 1815 (3): Mont St Jean and Wavre, Bloomsbury Publishing, 2015, p.18 These Dutch-Belgian units, nominally under the command of then 18-year-old Prince Frederick of the NetherlandsJac Weller, Wellington at Waterloo, Frontline Books, 210, p.240, were joined on the morning of 18 June by British and Hanoverian units. The troops, 17,000 in all, were placed around Halle to protect the Allied right (Western) flank from French attack, and instructed to hold their ground if attacked. However, they remained in reserve and did not take part in the fighting.

There is also a combat system which happens in real time, where you either attack NPC ships or other players. There is an alliance system, where you can join friends to help progress each other's upgrades. You can chat with these players or chat to other players in a global chat window. There are also events which give the players various rewards such as base resources, refined materials, officer xp, ship xp, officer shards, ship blueprints and faction points. The gameplay is PVP, there is no PVE-only mode as there is in many other MMO games. So be prepared to deal with having your ships destroyed, your resources plundered, and your base attacked. Although you can aid alliance members in research, repair, and construction times you cannot exchange resources nor can you grant help during ship to ship combat. There is an 'Armada' mode comparable to a raid in which a sufficiently advanced alliance can attack NPC stations. The gameplay is often unbalanced between a player's development of capabilities and the missions they need to complete. This makes the game lean heavily towards Pay-To-Win and their pay packages are mostly in the $20, $50, $100 range. A far higher cost than most games.

NASA gave them identification numbers A3326, A3400, A3305, A3356, and A3352, and their nicknames were given by the Apollo 17 crew, Eugene Cernan, Harrison Schmitt, and Ronald Evans. The four male mice, one female mouse, and Evans orbited the Moon for six days and four hours in the Apollo command module America as Cernan and Schmitt performed the Apollo program's last lunar excursions. One of the mice died (A-3352) during the trip, and the four others were killed and dissected for their intended biological information upon their successful return from the Moon. The three astronauts and the five mice were the last Earthlings to travel to and orbit the Moon. Evans and the five mice share two living-being spaceflight records: the longest amount of time spent in lunar orbit (147 hours 43 minutes), and the most lunar orbits traveled (75).NASA Apollo 17 page Mission Apollo 17 launched December 7, 1972, and returned to Earth on December 19. A biological cosmic ray experiment (BIOCORE) carried the five pocket mice (Perognathus longimembris), a species chosen for the experiment because they had well documented biological responses. Some advantages of the species included their small size, their ease of maintenance in an isolated state (requiring no drinking water for the expected duration of the mission and producing highly concentrated waste), and their proven capability of withstanding environmental stress. Fe, Fi, Fo, Fum, and Phooey had been implanted with radiation monitors under their scalps to see whether they would suffer damage from cosmic rays. Four of the five mice survived the flight; the cause of death of the fifth was not determined. After their return to Earth, the four remaining live mice were killed and dissected, and although lesions in the scalp and liver were detected they appeared to be unrelated to one another, and were not thought to be the result of cosmic rays. No damage was found in the mice's retinas or viscera. At the time of the publication of the Apollo 17 Preliminary Science Report their brains had not yet been examined, and subsequent studies however showed no significant effect on the mice's brains.

Considered the \\"godfather of puroresu\\", Rikid≈çzan was a national hero in post-World War II Japan and considered one of the most famous people in the whole country. One week after being stabbed, he died from peritonitis on December 15, 1963. He was 39 years old.  Background  Rikid≈çzan during his sumo days Rikid≈çzan was born Kim Sin-rak in South Hamgyong, North Korea on November 14, 1924. After his father's death in 1939, he was adopted by a family in the Nagasaki Prefecture of Japan. To avoid discrimination, he changed his name to , and first became a sumo wrestler, earning the Shikona Rikid≈çzan. He later left sumo in 1950, and after attending an American wrestling show in 1951, became a pro-wrestler. In post-World War II Japan, Rikid≈çzan turned himself into a national hero by booking himself to defeat numerous American wrestlers one after the other. Rikid≈çzan gained worldwide renown when he defeated Lou Thesz for the NWA International Heavyweight Championship on August 27, 1958, in Japan. In another match, Thesz willingly agreed to put over Rikid≈çzan at the expense of his own reputation. This built up mutual respect between the two wrestlers, and Rikid≈çzan never forgot what Thesz did. He would go on to capture several NWA titles in matches both in Japan and overseas. Rikid≈çzan also trained professional wrestling students, including soon-to-be wrestling legends Kanji \\"Antonio\\" Inoki, Kintaro Ohki, and Shohei \\"Giant\\" Baba. A crowd of people gathered to watch one of Rikid≈çzan's matches in 1955 With his success in pro wrestling, Rikid≈çzan began acquiring properties such as nightclubs, hotels, condominiums and boxing promotions. He established the Japan Pro Wrestling Alliance (JWA), Japan's first professional wrestling promotion, in 1953. Booking himself as the top star, Rikid≈çzan became more popular than ever, being viewed as a hero in the eyes of the Japanese public and helping establish professional wrestling in Japan. One of Rikid≈çzan's biggest matches, a May 24, 1963, sixty-minute two out of three falls draw with The Destroyer drew a 67.0 rating, the largest in Japanese history. Rikid≈çzan's JWA was also instrumental in increasing sales of colour televisions in Japan, due to high demand of wanting to see his matches. Rikid≈çzan was considered to be the \\"godfather\\" of pro wrestling in Japan, with newspapers and magazines saying \\"even if you did not know the name of the prime minister, there is no one who did not know the name of Rikid≈çzan\\" during the 1960s.  Incident  Rikid≈çzan entered Sann≈ç Hospital after being stabbed On the evening of December 8, 1963, Rikid≈çzan had been drinking with friends in Tokyo's New Latin Quarter Club, an upscale bar and nightclub. Later, while talking to a woman, he was involved in an altercation with Katsushi Murata, a member of the Sumiyoshi-ikka, a sub branch of the Sumiyoshi-kai yakuza family. Rikid≈çzan alleged that Murata stepped on his shoe, and demanded an apology. Murata refused and the two began to argue, with Murata pulling out a knife from his belt, which Rikid≈çzan saw and said, \\"I understand, let's make up, I apologise\\". ÂèÇÁÖß Murata refused the apology, and Rikid≈çzan punched Murata in the face, knocking him against a wall. Rikid≈çzan then mounted Murata and continued to punch him on the ground until Murata stabbed Rikid≈çzan once in the abdomen. Immediately, Murata fled the scene and Rikid≈çzan went to Sann≈ç Hospital, a hospital centered mainly on obstetric gynecology, but Rikid≈çzan chose it due to the fact he knew one of the doctors well and could prevent the story from appearing in tabloids. The doctor examined the wound and decreed it to be non- fatal, but advised him to have surgery. After members of the Tokon Gossai, a gang closely associated with Rikid≈çzan caught wind of the stabbing incident, they found and violently attacked Murata which led to his own hospitalization. Riki Mansion, home of Rikid≈çzan Rikid≈çzan underwent successful surgery and returned home, but went against doctors orders and resumed drinking alcohol almost as soon as he got home, which caused his condition to deteriorate once again. During this time, Rikid≈çzan was visited at Riki Mansion by both Murata and Murata's boss, Kunusa Kobayashi, who apologised, bowed his head and accepted responsibility for the incident. Rikid≈çzan forgave him.Á¨¨‰∫åÁ´† È∫ªÈÖî„ÅÆÂü∫Êú¨„Å®Á®ÆÈ°û Ê∞óÁÆ°ÂÜÖÊåøÁÆ°„Å®ÂäõÈÅìÂ±±„ÅÆÊ≠ª „ÇíÂèÇÁÖß Due to worsening his condition by drinking, Rikid≈çzan underwent a second successful surgery one week later, but had developed peritonitis and died at about 9:50 pm on December 15, 1963. He was 39 years old.  Aftermath  Rikid≈çzan's gravesite in Honmonji Temple, which features a life-size bust Rikid≈çzan's funeral was held on December 20, 1963, in Ikegami Honmonji Temple in ≈åta, Tokyo. Numerous figures from the worlds of politics, cinema and sports attended, as well as fans and members of the public, with the number of people reportedly exceeding 12,000 people. It is said that the row of people stretched over 500 meters from the temple all the way to Ikegami train station. Among those in attendance were Rikid≈çzan's students, Antonio Inoki, Giant Baba and Kintaro Ohki as well as various other opponents from throughout his career. Katsushi Murata was later found guilty of manslaughter in October 1964, and served eight years in prison before being released in 1972. Murata visited the grave of Rikid≈çzan every year on December 15 following his release, and also called the sons of Rikid≈çzan and apologised yearly. In the years following his release, Murata became a high ranking member of the Yakuza. Murata died on April 9, 2013 from natural causes.https://www.tokyoreporter.com/crime/yakuza/yakuza-who-stabbed-famed- wrestler-rikidozan-dies-in-tokyo/ Without a top star, Rikid≈çzan's Japan Pro Wrestling Alliance (JWA) and pro wrestling in Japan as a whole suffered greatly. Despite this, Rikid≈çzan's two best students Inoki and Baba vowed to keep professional wrestling alive and continued to run JWA into the 1970s. The two eventually left JWA in 1972 and formed their own promotions. Baba formed All Japan Pro Wrestling (AJPW), and Inoki formed New Japan Pro-Wrestling (NJPW). Both promotions remain active to this day. Rikid≈çzan's two sons, Yoshihiro Momota and Mitsuo Momota both pursued careers as professional wrestlers, as well as his grandson, Chikara.

He grew up in the West Midlands but as a child lived in several different places across the country, having once attended a school in Dundee. He was privately educated at the Yarm School, and went on to study law and the French language at the University of Nottingham, while completing an Erasmus Programme year in France. Career Oluwole has worked in non-governmental organisations (NGOs) and human rights agencies. At the age of 27 he left his job and moved into his parents' loft to become a campaigner against Brexit, telling the Evening Standard that he made the decision to quit because he was \\"frustrated that the pro-Remain argument was not being made effectively by mainstream politicians.\\" In pursuing this, Oluwole created the social media channel Our Future Our Choice in September 2017, which, with the collaboration of Will Dry and Lara Spirit, who had launched an anti-Brexit student activism movement in universities, was incorporated as a company on 19 February 2018. The group advocates a pro-EU message from a youth standpoint and claims that it will be the younger generation who will have to deal with the economic and political crisis that results from Brexit.

He was executed for killing 10-year-old Geneva Hardman, whom he killed by crushing her head with a stone. Biography Born and reared in Pembroke, Christian County, Kimbrough began using the alias of \\"Will Lockett\\" during his travels. In 1905, he attempted to strangle an unnamed white woman in Todd County on the farm of a T. B. Dawson, but failed and then fled the state. Following this attack, Kimbrough attacked and murdered a white woman at Carmi, Illinois in either 1912 or 1913, near train tracks crossing Louisville and Nashville. In 1917, he choked, raped and beat a black woman at Governor and Canal Streets in Evansville, Indiana, leaving her for dead. He was eventually enlisted to serve in the army at Camp Zachary Taylor in Louisville, Kentucky, where he raped and strangled a woman of \\"uncertain color\\" in February 1919. Authorities later managed to connect the last murder to that of Sallie A. Kraft, whose decomposed body had been found near the camp. =Murder of Geneva Hardman and riots= Geneva Hardman was a 10-year-old schoolgirl who lived in Lexington, who became Kimbrough's last victim. On February 4, 1920, her school satchel and cap were found near a fence bordering a large cornfield in southern Fayette County by a farmer named Speed Collins. Thinking a student had lost their items, he brought them to the nearby school, where the teacher, Mrs. Anna Young, recognized the items as Hardman's. She sent several older students to check if she was home ill, but her mother alerted them that she had not seen her since the morning. Collins and local store owner Claude B. Elkin, along with a Thomas Foley, left for the spot where the satchel and cap were found. After taking a closer look, they found the tracks of a large man. Following the trail, they found Geneva's body behind a fodder stock, which had been partly covered. Her body and nearby stalks were covered in blood, with a large rock next to it, and one of her hair ribbons was also found in the mud. The men then called the sheriff's office and the deputies soon arrived, led by Captain Volney G. Mullikin and his bloodhounds, who followed the large man's tracks leading into the town of Keene, in Jessamine County. It was later determined that although school children and the woman who lived on the road across the field, Bettie McClubbing, had been near the road at the time of the murder, no screams or sounds of a struggle were heard. The authorities' first break came when they met James Woolfolk, who was driving along the south pike and had offered a ride to Will Lockett. Lockett was a former WWI veteran and known burglar and bootlegger, who supported himself as a day laborer on farms. Continuing to follow the trails into Nicholasville, police questioned a farmer, Will Hughes, who had seen a black man walking along the pike, covered in mud to his knees. By then, a large search party had formed, which even sighted the fleeing man and gave chase, but he fled. He was eventually captured by Dr. W. T. Collette and Deputy Sheriff W. C. White near Dixontown, after he had tried to fool them that he was a man called \\"Will Hamilton\\". They initially left him on the road, but they saw him enter a residence and turned around to investigate. \\"Hamilton\\" was interrogated by Assistant Chief Ernest Thompson and Det. Dudley Veal, to whom he confessed to attacking Geneva because he had wanted to rape her, but had to kill her with a nearby found rock. Shortly after, he was sent to the Kentucky State Penitentiary. On February 9, 1920, riots erupted in Lexington, with lynch mobs trying to kill Kimbrough, but they were prevented by National Guard troops who ultimately fired into the crowd; six men were killed and twenty wounded. A soldier and two policemen were also seriously wounded. Amid looting and fears of further violence Governor Edwin Morrow requested Federal help, and 1,200 Army soldiers led by Brigadier General Francis C. Marshall were brought to Lexington on special trains. Marshall declared the county to be under martial law. Kimbrough was safely escorted to the prison and after two weeks martial law was lifted. Trial, sentence and death After confessing to Warden Chilton his true identity and previous crimes, Kimbrough was taken to court, where he was quickly sentenced to death by Judge Charles Kerr for murdering Hardman. Authorities at first attempted to confirm the slayings, but soon lost interest as Kimbrough was going to be executed anyway. He refused to make a statement when he was taken back to his cell, but prison officials claimed that he had prayed loudly and had sang hymns during the night. The day before his execution, Kimbrough publicly stated that he was ready to die, and that he had prayed for both Geneva Hardman and her entire family. On the day of his execution, he barely showed any emotion as the black cap was lowered on his face. Shortly thereafter, Collier, the prison executioner, turned on the electric current, which killed the prisoner within 15 seconds without a hitch. The execution was witnessed by Hardman's two brothers and 17 other civilians of Lexington, along with eight soldiers and 12 prison guards. Kimbrough's body was later buried in the prison cemetery. Question of guilt On June 15, 2014, Lexington Herald-Leader writer Joseph Anthony posted an article questioning Kimbrough's guilt, taking note of the speedy trial the man received and other factors.

They require lengthy research and development, may take a long time to reach commercial application, and often require large investments to achieve commercial success. The underlying intellectual property of deep tech innovations is usually well-protected and hard to reproduce, making it a strong competitive advantage or barrier to entry.  Definition  The term deep tech was coined by Swati Chaturvedi, co- founder and CEO of investment firm Propel(x). The word doesn't refer to innovation itself, but to a category of startup companies that develop new products based ‚Äúon scientific discovery or meaningful engineering innovation‚Äù. According to year 2019 research by the Boston Consulting Group and Hello Tomorrow, a French nonprofit that supports deep technology, the most prominent deep tech fields included advanced materials, artificial intelligence, biotechnology, blockchain, robotics, photonics, electronics, and quantum computing. Global private investment in those fields increased more than 20% a year from 2015, and reached almost $18 billion in 2018. Possible fields for deep tech application include agriculture, life sciences, chemistry, aerospace and green energy. In business context, deep tech has three key attributes: potential for impact, a long time to reach market-ready maturity, and substantial requirement for capital. * Deep tech innovations are often radical and may create new markets or disrupt existing ones. Deep tech companies often address big societal and environmental challenges and have potential to impact everyday life. Silicon chips are an example of innovation that enabled calculation at previously unimaginable speed and scale. * The time required to move from basic science to applicable technology in deep tech exceed the development time of startups based on widely available technology (\\"shallow tech\\" such as mobile apps, websites, and e-commerce services). For instance, the development of technology behind artificial intelligence took decades, and now AI companies are rapidly developing in many fields. According to Hello Tomorrow, as of 2019 it took an average of four years to reach market in biotech and 2.4 years in blockchain. * The demand for huge early-stage funding for R&D; and prototype development and lengthy life cycle of deep tech startups forces them to abandon the established funding progression from friends and family to angel and seed money, series A and subsequent rounds leading to trade sale or IPO.  History  The funding for deep tech companies has increased over the years. According to Boston Consulting Group, the total investments in Deep Tech companies increased from $1.7 billion to $7.9 billion from 2011 through 2016. Investment activities are concentrated in the United States and China that totaled for about 81% of global private investments in deep tech from 2015 through 2018 with approximately $32.8 billion and $14.6 billion invested in each country, respectively. China acts as the main driver in deep tech investments with funding increasing 80% each year over that period compared to 10% each year in the US. European countries are also active in deep tech investing. According to the Financial Times, in 2017 the total funding towards deep tech companies reached around ‚Ç¨3 billion across 600 deals. Corporations such as Google, Facebook, Amazon, IBM and Apple show increased interest towards deep tech applications in AI, virtual reality, drones, self-driving cars. Business accelerators also shift focus from narrow digital startups towards deep tech. In 2016 Y Combinator's batch there were 32 deep tech startups including 9 in biotech, 4 in drones and 3 in advanced hardware.

It dates to 1897 when it opened as an elementary school for African Americans. It was expanded to include a high school in 1923. The high school was merged into Summerlin Institute in 1969 following the desegregation era and its students became part of Bartow High School on the Summerlin campus. Union Academy became a Middle School. Union Academy has a dress code and follows the International Baccelaureate (I.B.) program. It is at 1795 East Wabash Street. History Union Academy was founded for the education of African Americans and named for the Union Academy, the fourth school founded in Florida for African Americans by the Freedmens Bureau in Gainesville. A.N. Ritchie was the school's first principal. The school was underfunded and only went to the 8th grade. A secondary education program added in 1923 to make it a high school. The old school was demolished and a new high school built on East Wabash Street in 1929. James E. Stephens became a teacher at the school in 1937 and became principal the following year, a position he kept for more than three decades. Desegregation of the schools was a multi-year process. In 1965, Polk County adopted a plan that allowed students some choice of where to attend. While no white students chose to attend formerly negro schools, many black students used this opportunity to attend previously all-white schools. 55 Union academy students chose to attend Mulberry, and 22 chose to go to Bartow Senior High. Union Academy merged with Summerlin Academy in 1969 and its students joined the white students on the Summerlin campus at what became known as Bartow High School. Ninth graders from both Summerlin and Union were moved to Bartow Jr. High while all 10-12 grade students were sent to Bartow Senior High School. The Union Academy campus became a middle school. In 1991 it was proposed that Union become an elementary school, but after complaints from the black community, it was instead decided to make it a magnet middle school. Bartow Middle School became the only middle school, and Union became a magnet in the fall of 1992. In 2010 the I.B. program was adopted. Athletics Union Academy's teams were known as the Tigers. In 1957, coached by Forrest McKennie, Union won the FIAA basketball state championship with a 23-0 record. McKennie also coached Union to state championships in football in 1954, 1958, 1960, and 1963, including a perfect record in 1954. McKennie was inducted into the Polk County Sports Hall of Fame in 2019.

The blast occurred during the Yellow Vest protests, that had some 32,000 protesters participating around France.  Aftermath  More than 200 firefighters responded to the incident, and French Interior Minister Christophe Castaner, Prime Minister √âdouard Philippe, and Paris Mayor Anne Hidalgo all visited the scene.

It is a legal issue addressed by the United Kingdom Mental Capacity Act 2005.  Intrusive research and UK's Mental Capacity Act  UK's Mental Capacity Act 2005 criminalizes intrusive research if it was carried out without securing the consent of the person involved, who has the mental capacity to make the decision. It is also unlawful to involve a person lacking mental capacity without the approval of an \\"appropriate body\\". The appropriate body pertains to the authority appointed by the Secretary of State in England and the National Assembly for Wales (e.g. Research Ethics Committee). The Act also applies to non-interventional research such as observational research. The law provides the statutory framework and provisions for the participation of people without the capacity to give consent in intrusive research. The Act also applies to clinical trials of treatments and procedures, but doesn't apply to trials of medicinal products, for which there is a separate regulation (The Medicines for Human Use Regulations, 2004). The Mental capacity Act code of practice, 2007, gives examples of intrusive research: * Clinical research into new types of treatments (except clinical trials of medicines that are covered by separate regulations) * Health or social care services research to evaluate the effectiveness of a policy intervention or service innovation. * Research in other fields, (e.g. criminal justice, psychological studies, lifestyle or socioeconomic surveys) * Research on tissue samples (i.e. tissue removed during surgical or diagnostic procedures) * Research on health and other personal data collected from records. * Observations, photography or videoing of humans.  Other usage  A broader conceptualization defines intrusive research as a method of data gathering that entails the participation of the investigator as opposed to non-participant observation.

During World War I, she functioned as a Q-Ship and served under the name Q.13, also taking the names Kai, Winton and Zebal. Aubrietia was part of the 1st Sloop flotilla, based in Queenstown and subsequently, the 3rd Sloop Flotilla in the North Sea. Aubrietia was sold for scrap on 25 October 1922. Design and construction Aubrietia was one of 12 Aubrietia-class sloops completed for the Royal Navy and was launched in 1916. She was originally designed as a minesweeper. As the first of the Aubrietia class, she was designed as single-screw fleet sweeping vessel, with a triple hull at the bows. The magazine was located aft above the water as protection against mine damage. Aubrietia had a displacement of 1,250 tons. She was in length overall, had a beam of , and a maximum draught of . The propulsion system consisted of a four-cylinder triple expansion engine, connected to a single propeller shaft. Maximum speed was . Aubrietia was laid down for the Royal Navy by Blyth Shipbuilding Company, Blyth, Northumberland, 1 January 1916 and launched on 17 June 1916. Service history = HMS Q.13 (Q-ship Aubrietia) = During World War I, Aubrietia was designated as Q.13 and served as a decoy Q-Ship. Her first captain was John Locke Marx, who was placed in command of Q.13 when she was still being readied for service on 20 August 1916. Between October - December 1916, Q.13 was assigned to anti-submarine patrols in the English Channel and South Western Approaches. On 22 December 1918, Q.13, operating out of Devonport, interrupted the German submarine which was in the process of boarding and scuttling the Danish steamer Hroptatyr west of the Channel Islands. In the rush to come alongside Hroptatyr, Q.13 collided with one of the Steamer's lifeboats, sinking it and killing Hroptatyrs captain. UC-18 dived away to avoid the sloop, and Q.13 dropped a depth charge in response, before picking up the survivors from Hroptatyr and the crew of the Danish steamer Dansborg, sunk by UC-18 earlier that day. UC-18 was undamaged. On 12 January 1917, Q.13, operating out of Milford Haven under the name Kai and flying the Danish flag, encountered the German submarine in the English Channel, off Les Casquets. After UB-23 fired two warning shots, Q.13 stopped and lowered a boat, simulating abandoning ship. The submarine then approached Q.13, and had closed to within when Q.13 uncovered her gun and opened fire, firing eight shells and hitting the submarine at least twice before UB-23 dived away, and then following up with two depth charges. Q.13s commander claimed that the submarine's conning tower had been blown off, but in fact the damage was not fatal, and UB-23 managed to safely return to base. Q.13s claim to have sunk the submarine was rejected by the Admiralty when a German complaint about British misuse of neutral flags showed that the submarine has survived. Q.13 was awarded a prize of ¬£200 (rather than the ¬£1000 for sinking a submarine) and her commander, John Locke Marx, was awarded the Distinguished Service Order. On 5 April 1917, fired a torpedo at Q.13, which missed. Q.13 was working with the British submarine which later that day fired three torpedoes at U-46, which also missed. As a decoy or Q-ship, Q.13 also sailed under other names including Kai, Winton and Zebal. = HMS Aubrietia = Q.13 reverted her name to HMS Aubrietia on 1 May 1917 and was listed as part of the First Sloop Flotilla operating in the Irish Sea, and based at Queenstown. On 20 June 1917, the Q-ship (Q.15) (a sister ship of Aubrietia) was engaged and sunk by the German submarine . Five of Salvias crew were killed and her commanding officer captured by U-94. The remaining survivors were picked up later that day by Aubrietia. On 5 July 1917, Aubretia encountered the German submarine , which after an exchange of gunfire, dived away. On the evening of 7 July 1917, Aubrietia encountered another submarine off Fastnet (probably ), which dived away to safety after Aubrietia fired 10 shots in failing light. Marx left the command of Aubrietia on 24 September 1917. On 19 October 1917, Aubrietia was part of the escort for Convoy HD7 when the Armed Merchant Cruiser , another of the convoy's escort, was torpedoed and sunk by the German submarine . Aubrietia took part in the search for survivors. Aubretia escorted homeward Dakar convoys HD22 (5 February 1918) and HD24 (3 March 1918). On 24 February 1918, Aubretia escorted convoy HE6. On 16 March 1918, Aubretia was involved in action against a suspected submarine whilst escorting convoy HE7. Following depth charge action by other vessels, Aubrietia spotted disturbance in water and dropped one charge. Spotting oil on the surface, Aubrietia dropped two more charges. In May 1918 Aubrietia formed part of the Northern Patrol, but by the end of the war had transferred to the 3rd Sloop Flotilla based out of Dundee and operating in the North Sea. Decommissioning and fate By November 1919, Aubrietia was held in reserve in Southampton. Aubrietia was sold for scrap to R.H. Partridge, 25 October 1922.

Biography and education Karlis Zalts studied at the Real Gymnasium in Jelgava southwest of Riga and graduated in 1904 and then went to the Ukraine to study engineering at the Kiev Polytechnic Institute. After graduating in 1912 he continued on there to teach. After Latvia became an independent country in 1918 Zalts decided to return to Latvia in 1921 with an appointment at the University of Latvia in Riga. To teach mathematics to engineering students until 1938. In 1928 he wanted to do mathematical research so he went back to school to graduate in mathematics in 1937 with a master's degree in nomography. He continued on to teach mathematics.

She practised in Copenhagen from 1898, opening her own clinic in 1906. She was also a prominent figure in the women's movement, chairing the Copenhagen chapter of the Danish Women's Society (Dansk Kvindesamfund) from 1909, later serving on the society's central board. In 1915, she became an active member of Danske Kvinders Fredsk√¶de (DKF), the Danish arm of the Women's International League for Peace and Freedom. The same year she joined the Scandinavian Family Law Commission where she was effective in furthering progress on women rights as spouses. From 1933 she participated on the executive board of Denmark's Women's Council (Danske Kvinders Nationalr√•d). Early life and education Born on 27 July 1873 in Copenhagen, Estrid Hansen was the daughter of the politician Octavius Thomas Hansen (1838‚Äì1903) and of Ida Antoinette Wulff (1845‚Äì1924), who was known for her needlework. Brought up in a well-to-do bourgeois home, she came into contact with prominent political and cultural figures during her childhood. After matriculating from N. Zahle's School in 1890, she studied medicine at the University of Copenhagen, graduating in 1896. That September, she married the engineer Hjalmar Hein (1871‚Äì1922). She went on to spend a year in Paris studying physiological optics, followed by study trips to clinics in Britain, the Netherlands, Austria and Germany. Professional life Back in Copenhagen, she began to practise in 1898, opening her own clinic in 1906 where she attracted many satisfied clients. In 1918, she received her specialist certificate and continued to practise until her retirement in 1939. Hein was also active in the women's movement, becoming a medical specialist in Kvindernes Handels- og Kontoristforening (Women's Trades and Office Workers Association) and serving on the board of Louiseforeningen (the Louise Society) which was established to alleviate poverty among destitute single women. In 1914, she became the first woman to serve on the board of Blindeinstituttet (the Blind Institute). From 1909 to 1916, Hein was chair of the Copenhagen branch of the Danish Women's Society where she was one of the most popular figures in the organization. She successfully campaigned for equal rights for women in regard to both voting rights and factory law. In 1915, together with Thora Daugaard, Clara Tybjerg, Benny Cederfeld de Simonsen and Henni Forchhammer, she became an early member of Danske Kvinders Fredsk√¶de, the Danish branch of the Women's International League for Peace and Freedom. The same year, she joined the Scandinavian Family Law Commission which worked successfully on improving women's rights in marriage with the 1920 marriage reforms in Denmark. Hein was part of a commission put together by the Social Democrat party on sterilization of the mentally handicapped. This commission published its report in 1926, under the title Betcenkning Angaende Sociale Foranstaltninger Overfor Degenerativt Bestemte Personer (Social measures toward Degeneratively Predisposed Individuals). The conclusion of the committee was that sterilization was justified in some cases of institutionalizations, that castration should be reserved for repeat sexual offenders, and left a lot of details of implementation to local physicians and administrators of institutions. Hein was also active in Den danske Komit√© til Bek√¶mpelse af den hvide Slavehandel which was established to combat white slave trade. She also played a leading role in the League of Nations' Advisory Committee on the Fight against Trafficking in Women and Children where she was a delegate for 18 years.

She was one of the first six European American women to cross the Rocky Mountains on what would become the Oregon Trail. Life Gray was born in Champlain, New York in 1810 where she had a religious upbringing. In 1838 William H. Gray returned from near Walla Walla where he was a founding member of an American Board of Commissioners for Foreign Missions mission. He had originally intended to pick up his fianc√© but her parents found out that he had nearly been killed in an ambush and refused to let their daughter leave with him. Her future husband tried to find another potential wife and in time proposed to Mary at a Church social on Valentine's Day. He asked her to join the mission as his wife. After a brief engagement they were married and she was one of the first women to travel up what would become the Oregon Trail to the Whitman mission. Spalding and Whitman had been the first women to make the journey and Gray arrived with Mary Fairbanks Eells, Mary Richardson Walker, Sarah Gilbert White Smith and their husbands. It took them 129 days from Independence to the Spalding-Whitman Mission arriving 29 August 1838. After being welcomed by the Whitmans they were sent on to help the Eliza and Henry Spalding at their mission in Lapwai in what is now Idaho. There Mary taught a class of the Nez Perce people and she would lead singing on a Sunday. Her husband did not get on well with the other missionaries and none would agree to share accommodation. He had been originally employed as a mechanic and assistant, but he wanted to found his own mission. He eventually obtained permission, but the plan came to nothing. Her husband wrote letters of complaint and eventually tendered his resignation. At one point Mary had to journey through snow with an eight month old child because her husband required her to be with him. They left the mission in November 1842 with their son and two daughters. Their son was said to be one of the first European American boys to be born west of the Rockies. The mission lasted until 1849 when all of the missionaries were killed by the Cayuse. The Grays took on a long journey by boat and wagon and they had to be rescued by the Hudson Bay Company. Mary and Mary had nine children and seven survived their childhood. William and Mary were running a laundry when news came of the gold rush in California. William sold off two thirds of the laundry and left Mary to run it and look after their children whilst he went off to find gold. Gray died in Clatskanie on 8 December 1881. She and her husband were reburied at the Whitman Mission National Historic Site Cemetery at Walla Walla in Washington in 1916.

It is located at a distance of circa 90 million light years from Earth, which, given its apparent dimensions, means that NGC 5846 is about 110,000 light years across. It was discovered by William Herschel on February 24, 1786. It lies near 110 Virginis and is part of the Herschel 400 Catalogue.  Characteristics  NGC 5846 is a giant elliptical galaxy with a round shape. It has a low luminosity active galactic nucleus, whose categorisation is ambiguous, having features that are observed both in LINER and HII regions. The source of nuclear activity in galaxies is suggested to be a supermassive black hole that accretes material. NGC 5846 harbors a supermassive black hole with estimated mass based on the central velocity dispersion. NGC 5846 harbors a large number of globular clusters; over 1,200 have been detected in images by Hubble Space Telescope. The specific frequency is similar to other elliptical galaxies in groups. As has been observed in other large elliptical galaxies, the metallicity has bimodial distribution, with metallicities roughly of [Fe/H]=-1.2 and -0.2. Their typical effective radii are in the range of 3 - 5 pc, with the largest clusters located in the central regions. Seven of the globular clusters have X-ray counterparts, which are among the most luminous X-ray sources in NGC 5846. These clusters are mostly in the central region and they are optically luminous, compact and belong to the red subpopulation. Chandra image of NGC 5846 with superimposed contours of HŒ±+[N ii] emission. White crosses mark the detected CO cloud positions. The galaxy has complex X-ray morphology that is considered to be the result of AGN outflows. Two inner bubbles in the hot gas, at a distance of 600 pc from the center and filled with radio emission, are clear indications of recent AGN feedback. A weak radio source, elongated in the NE‚ÄìSW direction, connects the inner cavities. X-ray-bright rims surround the inner X-ray bubbles. Many X-ray knots are visible, suggesting cooling sites. The scenario indicated by the Chandra observation is that of an AGN outflow, compressing and cooling the gas in the central ~2 kpc (20\\" at the distance of NGC 5846). 50px This article contains quotations from this source, which is available under the Creative Commons Attribution 3.0 Unported (CC BY 3.0) license. HŒ± observations reveal the presence of warm ionized gas in the inner 2 kpc of NGC 5846. Spectra of this gas indicate irregular motion, with a typical velocity of 150‚Äì200 km s‚àí1. The warm gas traces the X-ray-bright features, again suggesting a multiphase AGN outflow. Using the Spitzer IRS mid-infrared lines were detected (e.g., [Ne ii] 12.81 Œºm, [Ne iii] 15.55 Œºm) but no trace of polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbon (PAH) emission. Several sources are identified in the radio at 2.3, 5, and 15 GHz using VLBA data; these sources are aligned in the south‚Äìnorth direction. Recent Herschel PACS observations have detected the presence of [C ii]-emitting gas that extends to a radius of ~2 kpc and is centrally peaked. The [C ii] emission is almost exactly cospatial with the H-alpha +[N II] emission, and the total fluxes in [C ii] and H-alpha +[N II] have a ratio of 2.5, a very similar flux ratio value observed in other group- centered ellipticals. Furthermore, the velocities inferred from the [C ii] line are consistent with those measured for the HŒ± line. All of this evidence suggests that the [C ii] line is emitted by the warm gas, and it is not necessarily tracing the molecular phase. NGC 5846 has another indication that the cold gas is being disturbed by an AGN outburst. It has, in fact, an excess of cold (T ~ 30 K) dust approximately cospatial with the ionized and molecular gas. With a 70 Œºm luminosity of 3.5 √ó 1041 erg s‚àí1, NGC 5846 shares the same dust properties as several giant ellipticals (e.g., NGC 4636 and NGC 5044), which are best explained with the ejection of dusty gas from their centers by AGN activity that occurred ~107 yr ago. Three CO clouds have been detected in NGC 5846. Clouds 1 and 3 are resolved in at least one direction by ALMA 12 m array observations and extend to 1\\"2 and 2\\"9, respectively, and are about 5\\"5 and 8\\"4 away (0.6 and 1.0 kpc) from the galaxy center, respectively. Cloud 3 is aligned almost exactly along a dust filament, while cloud 1 also coincides with small dust extinction structures. The elongation and potential bimodality of the surface brightness of cloud 3 of NGC 5846 could indicate that it might be composed of two nearby (in projection) clouds. Cloud 2 lies further away from the centre and is thought to originate from cooling in the wakes beneath buoyant X-ray cavities where compressions stimulate significant large-scale, coherent radiative cooling.  Nearby galaxies  NGC 5846 forms a non- interacting pair with NGC 5846A, which lies 0.7 arcminutes from NGC 5846.Sandage, A., Bedke, J. (1994), The Carnegie Atlas of Galaxies. Volume I, Carnegie Institution of Washington Its proximity to NGC 5846 and high surface brightness suggests it has been tidally stripped. The barred spiral galaxy NGC 5850 lies at a projected distance of 10 arcminutes from NGC 5846 and may form an interacting pair with NGC 5846 based on its disturbed morphology. It is suggested that the two galaxies had a high speed encounter approximately 200 million years ago. NGC 5846 is the foremost galaxy of the large galaxy group known as the NGC 5846 group. Other members of the group include NGC 5813, NGC 5831, NGC 5845, and NGC 5854. The group has two subgroups, one centered around the elliptical NGC 5813 and the other around NGC 5846, lying at a projected separation of 600 kpc. The group is part of the Virgo III Groups, a very obvious chain of galaxy groups on the left side of the Virgo cluster, stretching across 40 million light years of space.

He was interim commander between 1826 and 1828.  Biography  Jacobus van der Breggen Paauw was born in Amsterdam to Pieter van der Breggen Paauw, a Remonstrant minister, and Jacoba Cornelia Maas. Van der Breggen Paauw was one of the colonial administrators that accompanied the designated Governor-General Herman Willem Daendels during his journey to the Gold Coast in 1815. Daendels's appointment as Governor-General of the scattered and rather unimportant Dutch colonial holdings on the Gold Coast was a consequence of being a leader of the Patriot faction in the Batavian Republic and Kingdom of Holland. After the House of Orange-Nassau was restored to the centre of power in the Netherlands in 1813, the newly inaugurated King William I of the Netherlands, found in the Dutch possessions Gold Coast a perfect excuse to rid himself of a potentially dangerous rival. To keep Daendels at peace, he was guaranteed an increased budget and some highly qualified colonial administrators, of which Van der Breggen Paauw was one. Between 1815 and 1821, Van der Breggen Paauw was as an assistant in the colonial administration, serving among other things as bookkeeper, secretary, fiscal and cashier. He was honourably discharged from his duties on 1 May 1821. Van der Breggen Paauw remained on the Gold Coast, however, and settled in Accra as a private merchant. In July 1825, Van der Breggen Paauw returned to the colonial administration as a resident, however, and became acting commander of the Dutch Gold Coast during the European leave of acting commander Friedrich Last between 3 January 1826 and 26 November 1827. Van der Breggen Paauw and his wife Martha Johanna Theodora R√ºhle both drowned when the ship that was to take them to the Netherlands sank near the Isles of Scilly.

The line operates every 20‚Äì25 during the peak periods and 60 minutes during the weekday middays and on the weekends. Route T14 trips roughly take 50 minutes. Background Route T14 operates daily between New Carrollton station and Rhode Island Avenue stations primarily running into neighborhoods unlike route T18 which is a direct route. The line also operates a limited stop segment between Mount Rainier Terminal and Rhode Island Avenue alongside routes G9 and T18 at all times serving only five stops. Local service is provided by routes 83 and 86. Route T14 currently operates out of Landover division. History Route T14 was originally named the Bowie-Belair Line and operated alongside the former route T12 Route between Rhode Island Avenue- Brentwood station and Bowie State University, between March 27, 1976 when both routes were created as brand new Metrobus Routes. Then on December 3, 1978, when New Carrollton station opened, both routes T12 & T14 were truncated to only operate between New Carrollton station & Bowie State University. In the early 1990s, the line was discontinued and replaced by routes B24, B25, and B27. Routes 84 and 85 operated alongside much of exactly the same routing, even when both routes were still streetcar routes that had yet to become Metrobus routes with route 84 operating daily and route 85 operating peak hours only. Routes 84 and 85 originally operated all the way between West Potomac Park & the Eastpine Shopping Center in Riverdale mostlu operating via, Riverdale Road, Kenilworth Avenue, Edmonston Road, Annapolis Road, Bladensburg Road, and North Capitol Street, to Downtown Washington D.C. as streetcar routes and the first few years of being Metrobus routes in 1973. =1976 Service Changes= The 84 running to New Carrollton Station in 2014 On March 27, 1976, routes 84 & 85 were rerouted to make a turn from Rhode Island Avenue, onto the intersection of Washington Place to enter and serve the newly opened Rhode Island Avenue‚ÄìBrentwood station. Routes 84 & 85 would then loop back onto Washington Place and then make a turn to get back onto Rhode Island Avenue and follow the rest of their routing along with routes 82, 83, & 86, the rest of the way from the Rhode Island Avenue‚ÄìBrentwood station all the way up to West Potomac Park via Downtown Washington D.C.. The routes would also serve Rhode Island when going Southbound. =1978 Service Changes= On September 21, 1978, routes 82, 83, 86, 84, 85 were shorten to terminate at Rhode Island Avenue‚ÄìBrentwood station only due to it being cost effective and duplicate to both the Red Line and other Metrobus routes. Passengers would have to transfer to either another Metrobus route or the Red Line to travel the rest of the way to Downtown Washington D.C. or West Potomac Park from Rhode Island Avenue‚ÄìBrentwood station. On November 21, 1978, when New Carrollton station opened, routes 84 & 85 were extended from their terminus at Eastpine Shopping Center, to New Carrollton station via Riverdale Road, Auburn Avenue, Good Luck Road, Lamont Drive, Carrollton Parkway, 85th Place, Powhatan Street, Westbrook Drive, 85th Avenue, West Lanham Drive, and Ellin Road. While route 84 would be the main route that operated seven days a week between Rhode Island Avenue‚ÄìBrentwood station & New Carrollton, route 85 would operate during weekday peak hours that would only allow passengers to board in Washington D.C. and alight in Maryland. Route 84 would still serve the Eastpine Shopping Center terminal while route 85 will bypass the terminal inside the shopping center. =2007 Service changes= On December 30, 2007, route 85 was discontinued and replaced it with modified route 84 trips which would have the same restrictions as the route 85 trips, while allowing passengers to board in Washington D.C. and alight in Maryland. During that same time, route 84's diversion into the Eastpine Shopping Center was removed and route 84 was rerouted to follow 85's routing straight along Riverdale Road through the Eastpine Shopping Center. =2014 Service Changes= On December 14, 2014, route 84 was renamed Route T14 keeping the same routing and discontinuing the 84 designation. WMATA also began a new limited-stop segment along Rhode Island Avenue between Mount Rainier terminal and Rhode Island Avenue-Brentwood station along with route T18. The limited stop segment was to reduce bus bunching along Rhode Island Avenue and improve on time performance for routes T14, and T18. Buses would only serve the following stops: * Rhode Island Ave & 12th St NE * Rhode Island Ave & Montana Ave NE (eastbound)/14th St NE (westbound) * Rhode Island Ave & 18th St NE * Rhode Island Ave & South Dakota Ave NE (eastbound)/24th St NE (westbound) * Rhode Island Ave & Newton St NE Passengers wishing for local service will have to use routes 83 or 86. =2020 Proposed Changes= On September 26, 2020, WMATA proposed to eliminate all route T14 Sunday service due to low federal funding. Route T14 has not operated on Sunday since March 15, 2020 due to Metro's response to the COVID-19 pandemic.

The group gained its initial notoriety through the sale of stolen medical records on TheRealDeal, a darkweb marketplace. Major targets for the group included the extortion of Netflix, which resulted in the leak of unreleased episodes of the series ‚ÄúOrange Is the New Black,‚Äù and Disney. In 2017, the group broke its trend of hacking and extortion, and began a series of terror-based attacks starting with the Columbia Falls school district in Montana. The group sent life- threatening text messages to students and their parents, demanding payment to prevent the murder of children. These attacks forced the closure of more than 30 schools across multiple school districts, resulting in more than 15,000 students being home from school for an entire week. During a senate committee hearing Senator Steve Daines (MO) referred to these attacks as \\"unprecedented\\", . On December 31, 2018, TDO announced the Lloyd's of London and Silverstein Properties \\"9/11 Papers\\" hack on Twitter, with thousands of incriminating documents to be released in stages unless US$2,000.000 in bitcoin were paid. TDOL was subsequently banned from many social media platforms including Twitter, Reddit, Pastebin and Steemit. Platforms unrelated to TDOL such as www.hpub.org also had their social media accounts eliminated or followers deleted for serving as mirrors of TDOL hacked documents. As of January 12, 2019, the bitcoin blockchain explorer revealed that less than 1% of the ransom had been paid and the payment sources may have been 9/11 researchers, not the targets of the hack. As a result, TDOL continues to release encrypted files and their private keys to the public in stages. It remains to be seen whether the documents contain anything that could challenge the official account of 9/11. Nathan Wyatt, a member of ‚ÄúThe Dark Overlord‚Äù hacking group was extradited from the UK to the US in December 2019 to face charges in St. Louis for his involvement in The Dark Overlord group. According to the charges, Wyatt \\"conspired to steal sensitive personally identifying information from victim companies and release those records on criminal marketplaces unless victims paid Bitcoin ransoms.

It was built to replace an earlier chapel which the congregation had outgrown. Plans were developed in 1877. The land in Bridge Street was purchased for ¬£518 and this debt was paid off by 1885, when fund-raising for construction started. By Easter 1893, the congregation had raised enough money to lay the foundation stone of the new building. The foundation stone was laid on 7 August 1893. It was designed by S. R. Bakewell C.E. of Belper, and the contractor was A. Hingley of Duffield. It was constructed with Darley Dale stone, relieved with cornices, strings and arches of dressed stone. The total cost was around ¬£2,700. Organ The church had a pipe organ by J.M. Grunwell dating from 1874 which was originally in the home of Thomas Barker Mellor. It was moved into the Baptist Church in 1901. A specification of the organ can be found on the National Pipe Organ Register. It was removed in 1994 and transferred to Holy Trinity Church, Milford.

Joy Reid first used the term in August 2017 in a tweet saying \\"@DrJasonJohnson @ZerlinaMaxwell and I had a meeting and decided it's called the K-Hive.\\" Campaign = Announcement = On Martin Luther King Jr. Day, January 21, 2019, Harris announced on Good Morning America that she would be seeking the Democratic presidential nomination. Her campaign headquarters were in Baltimore, Maryland, with a second office in Oakland, California. Her campaign slogan, \\"For the People,\\" is the phrase she used to formally announce her appearances as a prosecutor in the California superior courts as implicitly required by California law.California Government Code Section 100 requires all prosecutions to be conducted in the name of the people and by their authority. Within twenty-four hours of the announcement, Harris's campaign received over $1.5 million in donations from about 38,000 individuals across all fifty states, with the average donation being $37. At the time, this record amount tied with the one set by U.S. Senator Bernie Sanders during the 2016 election. An overflow crowd of over 20,000 people attended her formal campaign kickoff event at Frank Ogawa Plaza in her hometown of Oakland, California, on January 27. Numerous commentators noted that there were more attendees at Harris's kickoff event than Barack Obama's first presidential campaign kickoff in Springfield, Illinois, in 2007. = 1st Quarter = On January 28, Harris introduced herself as a 2020 presidential candidate in a CNN town hall at Drake University in Des Moines, Iowa. In the first quarter of her campaign, Harris announced the endorsements of five members of the California delegation in the U.S. House of Representatives - Ted Lieu, Katie Hill, and Nanette Barragan on January 28, Barbara Lee on February 14, and Julia Brownley on February 27. Continuing her early show of force from her home state, Harris also secured the endorsement of the Governor of California, Gavin Newsom, along with five statewide officials from California - Lieutenant Governor Eleni Kounalakis, Secretary of State Alex Padilla, State Treasurer Fiona Ma, Superintendent of Public Instruction Tony Thurmond, and Insurance Commissioner Ricardo Lara She also secured the endorsements from three-quarters of the Democratic delegation in the California State Senate, along with endorsements from the mayors of California cities San Francisco, San Jose, Sacramento, Long Beach, Oakland, and Compton. Harris also secured the support of former Massachusetts Attorney General Martha Coakley and Latina labor rights activist and co-founder of the United Farm Workers union, Dolores Huerta In March, Harris headlined a fundraiser from high-profile Hollywood donors at the home of American filmmaker J.J. Abrams and Katie McGrath. Co-chairs for the event included various other high-level studio executives, actors, writers, and directors, including Ari Emanuel, Donna Langley, Shonda Rhimes, and Ron Meyer. Harris reported raising $12 million from more than 218,000 individual contributions in the first quarter. = 2nd Quarter = Kamala Harris at California Democrats State Convention 2019 On April 1, Harris delivered a speech at a labor dinner honoring state legislators in Sacramento, California where she listed workers benefits that would not have been made possible without organized labor and condemned rhetoric that described unions as \\"special-interest groups.\\" On April 14, Harris released all of her personal tax returns from 2004 to 2018, each year that Harris has held public office. A Harris campaign aide said Harris's disclosure made her \\"the most transparent candidate in the field when it comes to information about personal finances.\\" On May 5, Harris gave a speech at the Fight for Freedom Fund Dinner of the Detroit Branch NAACP in which she pledged that her administration would \\"hold social media platforms accountable for the hate infiltrating their platforms, because they have a responsibility to help fight against this threat to our democracy\\" and referred to 2018 as the \\"deadliest year on record for domestic terrorism\\" since the 1995 Oklahoma City bombing. On May 16, Harris announced that her campaign had raised over $160,000 for abortion rights groups, following Alabama lawmakers approving a measure that outlawed almost all abortions including instances of rape or incest and imposed criminal penalties on doctors that had performed the procedure. On June 1, Harris delivered remarks at a San Francisco forum sponsored by the liberal group MoveOn when an animal rights protester jumped onstage and grabbed the microphone out of Harris's hand while she was trying to talk about equal rights. Moderator Karine Jean-Pierre moved to stand between Harris and the protester until security guards escorted him offstage. On June 26 and 27, the first debate of the primary season was held at the Arsht Center in Miami, FL, hosted by NBC and MSNBC. It was split into two parts, with 10 candidates debating on June 26 and 10 other candidates debating on June 27; a random drawing placed Harris in the latter group of candidates. On June 27, at one point in the debate, Harris criticized her fellow candidates for talking over each other, saying \\"America does not want to witness a food fight. They want to know how we are going to put food on their table.\\" Later, she criticized Joe Biden for his comments regarding his past work with segregationist Senators and his past opposition to busing. Her widely quoted comment was: Harris's performance in the debate received praise from many in the media, with some journalists referring to her as the unofficial winner. Morning Consult and FiveThirtyEight worked together on polling that reported that Harris's support among Democrats went from about 8% before the debate to almost 17% after the debate. Harris raised $2 million in donations in the first 24 hours after the debate, which is the highest amount of money that her campaign had raised in a 24-hour period to that date. President Donald Trump criticized Harris, saying she was given \\"too much credit\\" for her debate with Biden. In the second quarter, Harris announced the endorsements of five members of the Congressional Black Caucus - Al Green on June 20, Alcee Hastings on June 21, Lacy Clay on June 25, and Frederica Wilson and Danny Davis on June 30. She also secured the support of a member of the Congressional Hispanic Caucus when Jim Costa endorsed her on June 17. Harris also added to her support from California, securing the endorsements of nearly half the Democratic delegation in the California Assembly, including Speaker Anthony Rendon. Harris also secured the support of former member of the South Carolina House of Representatives Bakari Sellers. Harris raised $12 million from more than 279,000 donors by the end of the second quarter. = 3rd Quarter = Kamala Harris in Iowa on 10 August 2019 On July 12, Harris appeared on The View, where she stated her position on illegal immigration was treating the subject as a \\"civil enforcement issue\\" that was concurrent with a secure border, and not treating individuals who entered the U.S. illegally like criminals; before she stated her intent to discontinue multiple practices of the Trump administration as it related to the subject. On July 29, Harris released her own version of Medicare For All, which set forth a longer transition period of 10 years to move from the current system to a single- payer system without raising taxes on the middle class. Her proposal contained a public option and also allowed private insurance companies to offer healthcare plans within a highly regulated Medicare system modeled after Medicare Advantage. The proposal gathered praise from former U.S. Health and Human Services Secretary Kathleen Sebelius, but drew immediate criticism from supporters of Bernie Sanders. On July 30 and 31, the second debate of the primary season was held at the Fox Theater in Detroit, MI and hosted by CNN. Harris was assigned to participate in the second night of the second debate. On July 31, Harris defended her health care plan from claims by Joe Biden that it would cost $3 trillion and eliminate employer-based insurance. She asserted that her plan would \\"bring healthcare to all Americans under a Medicare for All system,\\" and disparaged his health care proposal as leaving around 10 million Americans uninsured. Congresswoman Tulsi Gabbard attacked Harris over her record as Attorney General, notably her past positions on marijuana, cash bail, and parole reform. At more than fifteen minutes, Harris spoke for the second largest amount of time of the second night candidates. On August 8, Harris was interviewed by CNN on her campaign bus, where she discussed President Trump's racial views and the existence of \\"a long list of statements and tweets and behaviors from this president that make it very clear that he possesses hate and that he is divisive and that he is a racist.\\" On September 12, the third debate of the primary season was held at the Texas Southern University in Houston, TX, hosted by ABC News and Univision. During the debate, Harris defended her campaign's version of Medicare for All that would authorize private companies to administer some plans in a tightly regulated way, while crediting Bernie Sanders for championing the prior version. Reaction to Harris's performance varied, as Vox noted that Harris and fellow contender Pete Buttigieg needed breakout performances that would lift them into (or back into) double digit polling, akin to Biden, Sanders, and Warren, and both failed in this regard; \\"Harris tried to land a few jokes and zingers (including an awkward line to Biden about how 'yes, we can' do gun control), but she seemed to be the only one laughing at them.\\" Jonathan Easley of The Hill complimented Harris's overall performance as she appeared \\"more at ease in a debate where she didn‚Äôt seem pressured to be leading the attacks against Biden.\\" At 13 minutes, 42 second, Harris was given the fifth most speaking time. On September 19, political aides for Harris reported that she was reorienting her presidential campaign strategy in order to invest in early states, after spending months on fundraising; and added that her intent was to finish in the top three in the Iowa caucuses, after doubling her campaign's organizing staff in the state. Harris was memorably caught on a hot mic declaring to Hawaii Senator Mazie Hirono \\"I'm fucking moving to Iowa.\\" On September 29, after it was reported that President Trump attempted to shake down the Ukrainian president to investigate Joe Biden and Hunter Biden, Harris defended the former Vice President and demanding that he be left alone on this matter. Harris called the issue a \\"distraction,\\" adding that the President was probably \\"looking at an indictment.\\" In the third quarter, Harris continued to build considerable support with members of the Congressional Black Caucus, securing the endorsements of Jahana Hayes on July 3, Danny Davis on July 30, Brenda Lawrence on August 1, and Marcia Fudge on August 15. Another member of the Congressional Hispanic Caucus, Ruben Gallego, endorsed her on September 12; Gallego had previously endorsed Eric Swalwell. Harris also secured the support of various Democratic leaders from the South, including former Governor of Mississippi and U.S. Secretary of the Navy Ray Mabus, Little Rock, AR Mayor Frank Scott, Jr., and Birmingham, AL Mayor Randall Woodfin. In addition, she also earned the support of the Black Caucus of the Michigan Democratic Party, and civil rights attorney Benjamin Crump. Harris reported raising $11.6 million in the third quarter, ending with nearly $10 million on hand. = 4th Quarter = Harris pays a visit to King Elementary School in Des Moines on 7 October 2019 On October 15, the fourth debate of the primary season was held at Otterbein University in Westerville, Ohio, hosted by CNN and The New York Times. Harris criticized the little time spent discussing abortion rights in any of the debates conducted by that point and asserted that impoverished women and women of color would die, due to Republican legislators in \\"various states who are out of touch with America [and who are] are telling women what to do with their bodies.\\" Later, Harris confronted Elizabeth Warren over her public snickering at the notion of joining Harris's calls for President Trump's Twitter account to be suspended. Harris spoke for a total of twelve minutes, which was the sixth-most among all candidates. On October 26, Harris pulled out of a criminal justice forum held at HBCU Benedict College after organizers indicated that the sponsor of the event, the 20/20 Bipartisan Justice Center, would be awarding President Donald Trump the Bipartisan Justice Award for the First Step Act, an award Harris herself received in 2016. Harris objected to the fact that students at Benedict College were not permitted to attend and were instructed to remain in their dorms during the event, stating: Senator Cory Booker decided to attend the event anyway.https://twitter.com/corybooker/status/1187900134530715648?lang=en Thereafter, the Mayor of Columbia, Stephen Benjamin said he was organizing an alternative forum alongside the 20/20 Bipartisan Justice Center's event. The next morning, organizers dropped the 20/20 Bipartisan Justice Center as a sponsor from the event. Harris participated in the ensuing reconfigured forum, retitled the Collegiate Bipartisan Presidential Forum. On October 30, Politico reported that the Harris campaign was laying off \\"dozens\\" of staffers at her Baltimore headquarters, as the campaign was \\"hemorrhaging cash.\\" The campaign confirmed the restructuring, and compared it to restructuring early in the campaigns of John Kerry in 2004 and John McCain in 2008. On November 2, Harris delivered a rousing speech at the Iowa Democratic Party's Liberty and Justice event, signaling a change in her messaging with the refrain that \\"Justice is on the ballot!\\" Harris received a rousing ovation from the room, including from supporters of other candidates. Several media commentators and journalists observed that it was the best speech of the campaign, and Harris's strongest performance to date. On November 7, it was reported that aides working for billionaire candidate Tom Steyer were caught stealing data from the Harris campaign after it was reported earlier that week that Steyer's aides had been caught offering a bribe to state and local politicians in Iowa in exchange for an endorsement. The DNC caught Steyer's aide in the act of stealing a large file of Harris's voter and volunteer data in the state of South Carolina, who was forced to delete the data and resign from the campaign. Steyer faced calls to drop out of the race. On November 8, Harris was the first candidate to hold a town hall with the rank and file members of Culinary 226 after receiving an exclusive invitation earlier that week. Harris told the members, mostly women and immigrants, that it was their feedback that formed the basis for her healthcare plan. During the town hall, Harris touted her record supporting organized labor in California, refusing to cross the picket line at the Marriott hotel, and attacking Station Casinos, against whom the union had been locked in a years-long attempt to unionize the company's properties. On November 20, 2019, the fifth debate of the primary season was held at Tyler Perry Studios in Atlanta, GA, hosted by MSNBC and The Washington Post. During the debate, Harris remarked on how she believed that in order to win the presidential election in 2020, the Democratic nominee must be able to rebuild the \\"Obama Coalition\\" as well as bring the Democratic Party and United States of America together. She further remarked that candidates had been taking for granted the constituencies that had been \\"the backbone of the Democratic Party\\" by showing up in a black church close to election time in the following statement: Later, when asked to respond to remarks made by Representative Tulsi Gabbard of Hawaii, Harris brought up Gabbard's frequent appearance on the Fox News channel during President Obama's terms as president, where Gabbard was known for frequent public criticism of Obama. This made up for one of the top three most tweeted moments pertaining to the debate. Another viral moment occurred when Vice President Joe Biden mistakenly remarked that the \\"only African-American woman that had ever been elected to the United States Senate\\" had endorsed him, to which Harris laughed, \\"No, that's not true. The other one is here.‚Äù Biden himself had sworn Senator Harris in to the United States Senate in January 2017. Following the debate, many political consultants and debate analysts praised Harris, noting that \\"she was very relatable.\\" A reporter covering post-debate coverage on MSNBC stated, \\"Just who resonated, who felt like they resonated, was Kamala Harris.\\" Despite fundraising and polling struggles, Harris continued to attract broad support. On November 16, Harris earned the endorsement of labor union United Farm Workers. Harris continued to build on her lead among endorsements with the Congressional Black Caucus, when Stacey Plaskett, Delegate to the United States House of Representatives from the United States Virgin Islands' at- large congressional district, pledged her support on November 21.'Salud Carbajal, member of the Congressional Hispanic Caucus endorsed her on November 22. Suspension On November 27, Harris spent the Thanksgiving holiday in Des Moines, IA with fellow candidates Amy Klobuchar and Cory Booker. She attended the Turkey Trot downtown and visited the Corinthian Gardens apartment, where Harris campaigned for President Barack Obama in 2008. Harris cooked a dry brined turkey herself. On November 29, The New York Times published an article detailing rifts in the Harris campaign, with \\"competing factions eager to belittle one another\\" loyal to either campaign manager Juan Rodriguez or campaign chair Maya Harris. Other staffers told the Times that it was \\"unclear who‚Äôs in charge of the campaign.\\" The article described the campaign's financial situation as \\"dire,\\" with the campaign unable to afford polling or television advertisements, and quoted staffers and supporters who described Harris as an indecisive candidate. On December 3, 2019, Harris officially ended her campaign to become the Democratic nominee for president, after stating she did not have enough funding to continue. She did not immediately endorse another Democratic candidate, but pledged to continue fighting to defeat Donald Trump. Trump sent a sarcastic farewell tweet‚Äî\\"too bad, we will miss you Kamala!\\"‚Äîto which Harris replied: \\"Don't worry, Mr. President. I'll see you at your trial.\\" On December 7, Politico reported that Harris had intended to replace Rodriguez as campaign manager with Laphonza Butler, but Harris ended her campaign before the change was made.  Historical significance  A Shirley Chisholm button, whose typography Harris paid tribute to in her campaign. Harris was the third office-holding African- American woman to seek the Democratic nomination for president, the first two being U.S. Representative Shirley Chisholm in 1972 and U.S. Senator Carol Moseley Braun in 2004 (the latter of whom is also the only other black woman to have ever served in the U.S. Senate). Harris launched her presidential campaign forty-seven years to the day after Chisholm's presidential campaign. Harris paid homage to Chisholm's campaign by using a similar color scheme and typography in her own campaign's promotional materials and logo. If nominated, Harris would have become the first Asian American and the first African- American woman to be the presidential nominee of any major party. If elected, she would have become the first woman, first Asian American, first Indian American, first person of Jamaican descent, and second African American to become president. Her husband, Doug Emhoff, would have become the first \\"First Gentleman\\" in American history, as all previous presidential spouses have been women.

It was organized by the Student Nonviolent Coordinating Committee along with the NAACP. Its main goals were voter registration and a citizenship education plan.Americus movement New Georgia Encyclopedia First protests The first march began in 1963, in an effort to desegregate the Martin Theater. Less than a dozen activists participated in the first march. Soon, some 250 people were involved. Law enforcement, led by police chief Ross Chambliss, and County Sheriff Fred Chappell began arresting many. Martin Luther King Jr. once called Chappell \\"the meanest man in the world.\\" Leesburg Stockade In July of 1963, another march was held, in which a group of young women joined the line to attempt to purchase tickets at the movie theater, and were arrested for doing so. After being held briefly in Dawson, Georgia, the protesters were moved to the Leesburg Stockade Public Works Building in Leesburg, where they were held for 45 days in poor conditions. Estimates of the number of young women who were held there range from 15 to about 30 or as many as 33. Some of the prisoners were as young as 12. Conditions in the stockade were poor: the prisoners had only concrete floors to sleep on, water only in drips from a shower, a single non-functional toilet, and poor food. The prison authorities did not inform the parents of the prisoners of their arrest or location, and they only found out through the help of a janitor. The young women were threatened with murder, and at one point a rattlesnake was thrown into their cell. After the SNCC and Senator Harrison A. Williams used a set of photos by Danny Lyon to publicize the situation,. the young women were released. They did not face any criminal charges, but were nevertheless charged a fee for their use of the facilities... They later became known as the \\"Stolen Girls\\". Two of the Leesburg Stockade women, Carol Barner Seay and Sandra Russel Mansfield, were added to the Hall of Fame of the National Voting Rights Museum in 2007..

He was, in 1884, the company's first mine manager and, in 1885, its first general manager. History Jamieson was born in Aberdeen, Scotland, in 1853, as the second son This and other newspapers, receiving their information by telegraph, reported the wedding date as a week later: 17 July 1890. of Rev. George Jamieson of the Church of Scotland, and his wife, Jane Jamieson n√©e Wallace. He was educated in Aberdeen and as an apprentice arrived in Adelaide in 1869,B. E. Kennedy, 'Jamieson, William (1853‚Äì1926)', Australian Dictionary of Biography, National Centre of Biography, Australian National University, http://adb.anu.edu.au/biography/jamieson- william-6827/text11815, published first in hardcopy 1983, accessed online 13 January 2019. then headed for the Victorian goldfields, where he had little luck, and so headed for Sydney. Armed with a letter of introduction to (later, Sir) John Hay‚Äì a friend of his father's, and wealthy squatter for whom the town of Hay is named he was sent by Hay to Grungle station, located 400 miles up the Murrumbidgee from Hay, New South Wales. He worked, for a time, as a jackaroo at the sheep station, until George Mair, manager of the station, induced him to give up jackarooing, and study surveying. In 1881, he entered the New South Wales Lands Department as a surveyor and, in March 1883, while in Bourke, he received his license as a surveyor under the Real Property Act. That same year, he was put in charge of the Bourke-Silverton district, which included the Barrier Ranges. In 1884, he was sent to complete the long-awaited survey of mining claims at Silverton. Shortly after his arrival, a long drought‚Äì which had dispirited many prospective miners ‚Äìbroke, and threatened many with flooding. Jamieson fell in with the Syndicate of Seven prospectors and investors led by George McCulloch, and the discoverer Charles Rasp (who, on 5 September 1883, had pegged out a lease of some 20 acres of scrub-covered country, later known as Block 12), and named themselves the Broken Hill Mining Company (later, BHP), the other five members of which were: George Urquhart, G. A. M. Lind, Phillip Charley, David James and his mate, James Poole. McCulloch pegged out another claim, later designated No. 13. The others claimed one apiece, and the syndicate had Blocks 12 to 15, later 10 to 17; the claims stretched over two miles in length. The seven shares were parlayed into fourteen. Lind was the first to bow out of the company, selling his shares to Rasp and McCulloch, and Urquhart left a year later. Jamieson purchased three shares for ¬£320. He shortly divested himself of two, one of which became the property of W. R. Wilson. Subsequently, Jamieson was approached by one Thomas Low, who had stumbled on an outcrop of silver ore some distance away from where the prospectors had been working, and offered to show him its location, if he could buy into the syndicate. As it could take a considerable time to re-discover the outcrop in such a large area of scrubby country, Jamieson agreed. The number of shares issued had only recently doubled again, and Low's received was one of these shares. W. R. Wilson, manager of the Barrier Ranges Silver Mining Association, bought into the association a few months later, as did Bowes Kelly, in 1884, paying ¬£150 for a twenty-eighth share, and Harvey Patterson, in 1885, paid ¬£1800 for a twenty-eighth share; within ten years, those shares were each worth ¬£1.5 million. Until Jamieson became a shareholder, McCulloch had always \\"called the shots\\" in the operation of the mine; Jamieson gained the respect of the other shareholders and, when the company moved, in 1885, to register as a Proprietary Limited, Jamieson was elected managing director, at a salary of ¬£500 per annum, and resigned from the public service. He resigned as managing director the following year, to be replaced by engineer S. R. Wilson. In 1895, Jamieson was elected to the board. He died in his sleep at his home \\"Clarence\\", Queen's Road, Melbourne, after seven months' illness.

Chettle House Chafin was baptized on 7 January 1689, the fifth son of Thomas Chafin MP of Chettle and his wife Anne Penruddock, daughter of Col. John Penruddock of Compton Chamberlayne, Wiltshire. His father commanded a troop of horse against the Duke of Monmouth at the Battle of Sedgemoor in 1685 and died in 1691. Chafin was probably educated at Winchester College from about 1702 to 1706; and matriculated at Oriel College, Oxford on 12 July 1707, aged 18. He succeeded to the family estates in Dorset, Hampshire, Surrey and Somerset on the death of his elder brother Thomas in 1711. Chafin wasted no time in rebuilding Chettle House to the design of the architect Thomas Archer. He married Elizabeth Sturt, daughter of Sir Anthony Sturt, MP by licence dated 8 February 1714. Chafin was returned unopposed as Tory Member of Parliament for Dorset at the 1713 general election. There are no known speeches or votes by him in that Parliament. He was returned unopposed in 1715 and 1722, but there was a contest in 1727 at which he was successful. At the 1734 general election, he was returned unopposed again at Dorset. He withdrew on the motion for removing Walpole in February 1741. He was returned unopposed again at the 1741 and 1747 general elections. He voted consistently against the Administration from 1715 onwards. By 1748 he was in financial difficulties, and had to obtain an Act of Parliament to allow him to sell some of his settled estates to pay his debts. At a meeting at Dorchester in August 1753, he declined nomination for the next election, being according to an electoral survey \\"ruined in his affairs\\", and did not stand in 1754. Chafin's financial difficulties continued and in 1757 he had to obtain another Act of Parliament to allow him to sell off more of the estates. He died on 7 September 1766. He had five sons and three daughters.

Gibbs' uninjured but decomposed body was discovered, without the plane, on a hillside four months later but how and why he came to be there has never been established.  Background  = Peter Gibbs = Norman Peter Gibbs, born in 1920, was a former Spitfire pilot with No. 41 Squadron RAF in World War II. Flight Officer Peter Gibbs served with 41 Squadron between January 1944 and March 1945. In August 1945, after he left the RAF, Gibbs became a professional musician and joined the Philharmonia Orchestra in 1954. In 1956, he joined the London Symphony Orchestra. Gibbs' tenure with the orchestra is notable for an incident which occurred during a tour of the United States in 1956. The Orchestra felt conductor Herbert von Karajan had been unprofessional when conducting smaller concerts during the tour. The last straw came when von Karajan left the stage in Boston after the last note was played, neither waiting for applause nor calls for an encore. The orchestra was upset by this apparent slight to both them and the audience, but turned up nonetheless on time for an early rehearsal the next day. Karajan, however, came in late, much to the disgruntlement of the whole orchestra. When he finally arrived Gibbs stood up and addressed Karajan directly, demanding an apology. He rebuked von Karajan, stating, \\"I did not spend four years of my life fighting bastards like you to be insulted before our own Allies as you did last evening.\\" Karajan ignored him and continued conducting as if nothing had happened. However, that night during a concert, Karajan refused to go back on stage after the interval until a letter was signed stating that Gibbs be immediately sacked. The orchestra's managers had little choice but to comply and Gibbs never played with the Philharmonia again. Gibbs joined the Surrey Flying Club in June 1957 and then flew regularly for the next 18 years. He continued to fly in his civilian life and held a private pilot's licence with more than 2,000 hours' flight experience. In later life Gibbs became the managing director of a property development company called Gibbs and Rae. Gibbs was 55 at the time of the disappearance and resided in London, England. = The Isle of Mull = On Saturday 20 December 1975 Gibbs travelled to the Isle of Mull, in the inner Hebrides, Scotland via ferry as he was interested in buying a hotel as an investment. Gibbs arrived on Mull with girlfriend Felicity Grainger, a 32-year-old university lecturer. The couple were using the Glenforsa Hotel on the edge of the Sound of Mull, as their base. The hotel had its own 780 m airstrip and they were using a plane to fly between the Inner Hebridean islands. The couple were staying in room 14 and the hotel was busy despite it being winter. = Glenforsa Airfield = Glenforsa Airfield was built by the Royal Engineers between May and August 1965 to act as the only fixed-wing air ambulance evacuation facility on Mull. The airstrip is grass and at that time had no runway lights. Glenforsa Airfield = The plane = Cessna F150H Gibbs hired a Cessna aircraft from the manager of the Glenforsa Hotel, David Howitt. The plane was a Cessna F150H, registration mark G-AVTN painted red and white. The Cessna had been owned by Ian Hamilton since September 1975 and was kept at North Connel airport near Oban. Gibbs' private pilot‚Äôs licence had expired but he told the owner of the plane that he had left his licence behind.  Day of the disappearance  On the morning of 24 December, 1975 Gibbs and Grainger flew from Mull to Broadford on the Isle of Skye to spend the day viewing properties. They flew back to Mull and had a dinner at the hotel that included whisky and red wine. = The flight = Gibbs and Grainger had just finished dinner at the hotel when Gibbs decided to take a solo flight. Gibbs borrowed two powerful torches to use as landing lights for Grainger to use them to guide him in. Some guests present stated that they thought they saw two people moving torches on the runway. Others observed that Gibbs appeared to have spent an unusually long time warming up the plane‚Äôs engine. Gibbs was observed to turn the plane lights off, then on, then off again. He then took off from the unlit airfield on a moonless night and, after the plane disappeared behind a line of trees, he was never seen alive again. The hotel guests realised that Gibbs was intent on making a circuit and rushed upstairs to the bar to watch the landing as the airfield was almost never used at night. The guests turned the lights off in the bar to reduce internal reflections on the glass and get better view of the night flight. Grainger stood at the end of the runway holding the torches. After 10 minutes Howitt began to worry, fearing that the plane had ditched, and went to try to find the plane. He drove the hotel‚Äôs Ford Cortina through the driving sleet to try to find Gibbs. Howitt dipped the car's headlights to illuminate the water but no trace of the plane was seen. An organised search was mounted but no trace was found of Gibbs or the plane. The search was described as huge and extended over the Christmas holiday.  Discovery of the body  In April 1976, four months after the disappearance, Gibbs' body was discovered by a local shepherd, Donald MacKinnon. The body was found lying partway up a remote hillside about from Glenforsa Airfield. The initial search for Gibbs had passed through this area at the time of the disappearance, but nothing had been found at that time. The body was found lying across a fallen larch tree up the hillside, not far from the road. Due to decomposition the only thing holding the body together was the clothing. The body was facing due north in a direction that indicated that Gibbs was walking down hill. The police had to cut a branch off the tree to remove the body. The body was taken to Glasgow for the post mortem. Gibbs' remains gave no clues to his cause of death. Only minor injuries were found and there was nothing to indicate a fall from a plane or any evidence that he died in another place and was left on the tree. According to the pathologists‚Äô report the condition of the body was ‚Äòentirely consistent with lying out there for a period of four months‚Äô. Forensic tests detected no salt or marine organisms in Gibbs' clothing or boots. In the absence of any other evidence, Gibbs' death was noted down by the pathologist as being due to exposure. The discovery of the body sent investigators looking for the plane on land, in woods and by dragging lochs. No wreckage was found of the aircraft at that time.  Apparent discovery of the plane  In September 1986 it was claimed that the plane had been found in the sea off Oban. A clam diver searching for scallops reported finding a small plane with both wings missing. The wreckage was 200‚Äì300 m off the coast at the bottom of the sound of Mull. It was reported that the windscreen was out and both doors were locked. The aircraft yielded no clues as to how it came to be there. Gibbs' body was found in a location that was across a road and up a steep climb from the reported location of the plane. In February 2004 minesweepers HMS Pembroke, HMS Penzance and HMS Inverness were undertaking a coastal mapping operation in the waters off Oban and found a plane 30 m beneath the surface. HMS Pembroke used a remote underwater camera to take pictures of the wreckage which appeared to be of a small plane with one wing still attached, possibly Gibbs' Cessna.

He was forced out of the position by the military government when it dissolved the union in 1988. During Abacha's regime, he was brought back into labour matters as the sole administrator of NUPENG.  Life  Chiroma spent his early years in Maiduguri, Borno State. He attended Yerwa Elementary School and Borno Middle School (1945 -1949). He trained as a medical field assistant and worked in Jalingo and Mubi. In 1977, he was principal School of Health Technology, Maiduguri. Chiroma joined trade unionism at the age of seventeen and was president of the Rural Health Workers Union in 1960. In 1978, after many smaller trade unions were coalesced into forty two industrial unions, Chiroma became deputy president of the Medical and Health Workers Union. At the NLC congress in 1981, he was voted as the union's deputy president. He was voted president in 1984, succeeding Hassan Sunmonu. As president, one major responsibility of Chiroma was to keep the union united as NLC like many of its predecessors was split into ideological groups pulling it in different directions and a military president was beginning to influence some union leaders. Chiroma's tenure began at the onset of a change in government from a democratic administration that was ended by a military coup in December 1983. He had the difficult task of managing the union while austerity measures provided reason for workers to be sacked without adherence to disengagement rules and wages were frozen by the new military administration. As head of the central working committee of NLC, he was also involved in protest concerning changes in minimum wage regulations and acceptance of IMF loan terms. In 1986, a new military president proposed changes to the minimum wage act that will increase the employee threshold for businesses to be bound by the act, the proposed change was from employers with 50 employees to a new threshold of 500 employees. NLC developed a consistent campaign against the amendment with threats of a national strike which led the proposal to be shelved. However, his tenure was more known for the protest against the removal of fuel subsidy. The adoption of a structural adjustment programme (SAP) by President Babangida which favored market forces meant subsidies for fuel consumption was likely to be removed. Chiroma's NLC coordinated rallies with state chapters in protest against the removal of subsidies while Chiroma criticized and opposed many of the elements of SAP. In December 1987, leadership of NLC were detained and the government increased pressure on NLC to withdraw its opposition to the elements of SAP. In 1988, division within the NLC provided the opportunity for the government to disband the leadership and elect a sole administrator.

Protests continued from late 1961 to the summer of 1964. The movement led to the desegregation of all schools, recreational areas, and hospitals in Maryland and the longest period of martial law within the United States since 1877. Many cite it as the birth of the Black Power movement. Background Black residents of Cambridge had the right to vote, but were still discriminated against and lacked economic opportunities. Their homes did not have plumbing, some even living in \\"chicken shacks.\\" And since the local segregated hospitals were white, black residents had to drive two hours to Baltimore for medical care. They had the highest rates of unemployment. The black unemployment rate was four times higher than that of whites. The only two local factories, both defense contractors, had agreed not to hire any black workers, as long as the whites agreed not to unionize. All venues of entertainment, churches, cafes, and schools were segregated. Black schools received half as much funding as whites. The movement =Initial Protests= On Christmas Eve of 1961, Student Nonviolent Coordinating Committee Field Secretaries Reggie Robinson and Bill Hansen arrived and began organizing student protests. In 1962, the Cambridge Nonviolent Action Committee, (CNAC), was organized to run these protests. Gloria Richardson and Inez Grubb both became the co-chairs of the CNAC. It was the only affiliate of SNCC that was not student-led. The CNAC began picketing any business which refused to hire blacks. They conducted sit-ins at lunch-counters which would not serve blacks. White mobs often disrupted protests such as these. Protests on Race Street, which separated the black and white communities, often became violent. Cleveland Sellers, who was a SNCC Field Secretary, later said, \\"By the time we got to town, Cambridge‚Äôs blacks had stopped extolling the virtues of passive resistance. Guns were carried as a matter of course and it was understood that they would be used.\\" Richardson defended such actions by blacks: \\"Self-defense may actually be a deterrent to further violence. Hitherto, the government has moved into conflict situations only when matters approach the level of insurrection.\\" In the spring of 1963, over a period of seven weeks, Richardson and 80 other protesters were arrested. Tensions rose steadily and by June, blacks were rioting in the street. Maryland Governor J. Millard Tawes met with the protesters at a local school. He offered to accelerate school desegregation, build public housing, and establish a biracial commission if they only cease the protests. The CNAC rejected the deal, and in response, he declared martial law and sent the National Guard to Cambridge. =Treaty of Cambridge= Possible violence close to the capitol brought Cambridge to the attention of the Kennedy Administration. Attorney General Robert F. Kennedy began holding discussions with the CNAC. They, and the local city government, reached an agreement which would prevent possible violence. It would also desegregate public facilities, create provisions for public housing, and establish a human rights committee. It was called the \\"Treaty of Cambridge.\\" But the agreement soon fell through as the local government demanded that it be passed by a local referendum. =George Wallace= In May 1964, George Wallace, the segregationist Governor of Alabama, arrived in Cambridge to give a campaign speech. He had been invited by the DBCA, the city's primary business association. Black protesters soon appeared to protest his appearance and a riot occurred. Aftermath Once the Civil Rights Act of 1964 was passed by Congress, the movement lost all momentum. The federal government had mandated everything that the CNAC had been fighting for. As protests ended, the National Guard withdrew. Gloria Richardson resigned from the CNAC and moved to New York City.

On May 4, 1898, with the participation of the parish priest of Bydgoszcz, J√≥zef Choraszewski, city authorities, doctors and donors, a 12-bed hospital for children opened. The Bromberg address book from 1900 lists sisters with the following surnames living in the premises: Doliwa, Gralewska, Hermanska, Hoppe, Kapke, Schmidt. At that time, there was only a one-story building in the yard with several rooms containing beds for patients. In 1901, thanks to the help of the countess Potulicka, a separate branch for infectious children was organized in a separate building. In the years 1905-1906, about 200 children lived in the facility. In 1905, the recorded board of trustees comprised, among others, Parson Ryszard Markwart and Dr. Stanis≈Çaw Warminski, the uncle of Dr. Emil Warminski, a famous local activist. Sisters even organised summer camps. At that time, the hospital had 36 beds and was maintained only by donations from Poles and landowners, among whom countess Potulicka. In 1914, a hospital for wounded German soldiers opened in a section of the building. After 1920, both children and adults were treated at the hospital. In 1940, the Sisters of Charity were expelled from the premises, taken over by German forces who again used it as a military hospital. In spring 1946, it became a Polish Garrison hospital which was transferred to Toru≈Ñ in 1948; the buildings then returned to their civilian goal. Recently, the clinic has developed a specialized HIV/AIDS research department and has become a reference center for HIV infections. In 2011, thanks to Kuyavian-Pomeranian Voivodeship funds, a modern building has opened next to the ancient ones, which keep administration offices and some laboratories. On January 29, 2019, the hospital celebrated its 70th anniversary as a Center for Infectious Diseases. The ancient brick building was erected in the first decade of the 20th century, thanks to Dr. Stanis≈Çaw Warmi≈Ñski, who in 1906 donated all his savings to the hospital. The Neo-Gothic project, designed by builder W. Pluci≈Ñski from Che≈Çmno, was also realized by J√≥zef ≈öwiƒôcicki. It opened on May 6, 1910.

Key concepts Johnson uses a case-study approach to explore the deliberate, \\"full-spectrum\\" analysis process used by successful decision-makers. Examples range widely, from the 2011 raid that killed Osama Bin Laden to the destruction of Manhattan's Collect Pond, and even include the literary depiction of decision-making under uncertainty in George Eliot's Middlemarch. Johnson mines these examples for decision-making tools: \\"We don't have an infallible algorithm for making wise choices, but we do have a meaningful body of techniques that can keep us from making stupid ones. \\" In Johnson's view, \\"the craft of making farsighted choices ‚Äî decisions that require long periods of deliberation, decisions whose consequences might last for years, if not centuries, as in the case of Collect Pond ‚Äî is a strangely underappreciated skill.\\" A tendency to concentrate on the specific elements of a decision may obscure the process by which \\"hard decisions\\" are made, a slow process that is very different from the \\"flash judgments and gut impressions profiled in books like Blink and How We Decide,\\" which rely on the automatic \\"System 1\\" brain described in Daniel Kahneman's Thinking, Fast and Slow. Johnson advances the idea that skilled, forward- looking decision-makers use a process comprising separate mapping, predicting (including forecasting and simulating), and deciding steps. Decisions involve distinct divergence and consensus phases. \\"In a divergence phase, the key objective is to get as many perspectives and variables on the table as possible through exploratory exercises designed to reveal new possibilities.... sometimes those possibilities take the form of an entirely new path that you didn't contemplate at the beginning of the process. In the consensus phase, the open-ended exploration of new possibilities reverses course, and the group begins to narrow down its options, seeking agreement on the correct path. Each phase requires a distinct set of cognitive tools and collaborative models to succeed.\\" =Mapping= The first step in confronting a hard choice is to make a map \\"to describe the literal and figurative terrain around you: taking inventory of all the forces at play; sketching out all the regions that are visible, and at least acknowledging the blind spots; charting the potential paths you can take in navigating the space.\\" The goal is \\"a set of potential paths, given the variables at play in the overall system.... mapping is the point in the decision process where divergence and diversity are key. You are not looking for consensus in this phase; you are looking to expand the range of possible factors (and, ultimately, decision paths). The challenge of mapping is getting outside our intuitive sense of the situation in front of us. Our minds naturally gravitate to narrowband interpretations, compressing the full spectrum down into one dominant slice.\\" Farsighted decision-makers do not force the map \\"to match some existing template,\\" but instead develop \\"the kind of keen vision required to see the situation as it truly is.\\" =Predicting= Making hard choices implicitly entails \\"making predictions about the course of future events,\\" but successful decisions require \\"a better-than-chance understanding of where the paths you're choosing between are going to take you. You can't be farsighted if the road ahead is blurry.\\" Hill's randomized controlled trial concept is offered as an example of a tool that meaningfully increased the accuracy of predicting the future behavior of complex systems. Ensemble simulations, war games, scenario planning, red teams, and Gary Klein's \\"premortem\\" procedure serve to incorporate and localize uncertainty, helping decision-makers avoid a \\"range of cognitive habits ‚Äî from the fallacy of extrapolation to overconfidence to confirmation bias ‚Äì [that] tends to blind us to the potential pitfalls of a decision once we have committed to it.\\" Several of these tools were used to reduce and define uncertainties encountered in planning the US raid on Abbottabad. =Deciding= The process of making a final decision, a process that may be more art than science, can be clarified by \\"keeping score.\\" Johnson compares scenario scoring techniques based on either maximizing value or minimizing harm. The latter, formulated as a probabilistic assessment of risks, confers long-term advantage in forcing the consideration of \\"not just our objectives and values, but also something we can be too quick to dismiss: the highly unlikely catastrophe.\\" As reviews of this book have noted, Johnson does not prescribe a particular approach but counsels the decision-maker to take time to mull over options and select paths that can be modified later. \\"Hard choices demand that we train the mind to override the snap judgments of System 1 thinking, that we keep our mind open to new possibilities ‚Äî starting with the possibility that our instinctive response to a situation is quite likely the wrong one.\\" Subsequent chapters entitled \\"The Global Choice\\" and \\"The Personal Choice\\" explore the ramifications of decisions affecting many or a few people, and the important role of imagination in each. Critical reception Reviews of Farsighted are generally positive, emphasizing Johnson's expertise in writing about the history of ideas and praising its use of apt examples. The New York Times called it an ‚Äúidea book,‚Äù a ‚Äúriveting‚Äù analysis of how skilled long-term thinkers approach decisions that, unlike a typical business book, does not prescribe ‚Äúeasy formulas\\" for how one would make decisions about ‚Äúthe grand moments that shape our futures.\\" A Financial Times review praises Johnson's suitability to address this topic, gracefully served examples, and its \\"positive\\" approach. The Wall Street Journal said the book \\"lose(s) steam\\" in a consideration of decision-making at a global scale, illustrated with the issue of climate change, but its final chapter, regarding a momentous personal decision, seems to be \\"from the heart.‚Äù See also * Decision-making References External links * *Interview with the author on the WAMU/NPR 1A program (06 Sep 2018) Category:2018 non-fiction books Category:Popular culture books ","title":"Farsighted (book)"},{"id":"59644654","text":"David William Rohde (born June 4, 1944) is an American political scientist and the Ernestine Friedl Professor of Political Science in the Trinity College of Arts and Sciences at Duke University.

Life  Fogels was born on 12 October 1910 in Lidzibas, Nigrande, Saldus, Latvia. He discovered his interests in mathematics when attending the Second Gymnasium in Riga. In 1928 E. Fogels entered the Faculty of Mathematics and Natural Sciences of University of Latvia. After graduating in 1933, he was invited in 1935 to join this university to lecture in algebra and number theory and did research on Diophantine equations. At the end of 1938 he went to University of Cambridge, England to work under the supervision of Albert E. Ingham to help improving the estimate of the difference between two consecutive primes. World war II broke out after Fogels had returned to Latvia in 1939. In 1940, E. Fogels was appointed associate professor at University of Latvia. In 1947 he defended his PhD thesis on the sequences of asymptotically uniformly distributed numbers and went to work at the newly formed Institute of Physics and Mathematics of the Academy of Sciences of the Latvian SSR as a research fellow.

After an election was held in April under disputed circumstances, and was subsequently nullified by the courts, a special election was held in July. Republican Monroe Heath won the special election in July, thus becoming mayor of Chicago. These are the last Chicago mayoral elections (including special elections) to take place in an even-numbered year. They are also the only elections since 1862 to have been held in an even-numbered year. Disputed April election The disputed Chicago mayoral election of April 1876 was won by Thomas Hoyne. However, its result was ultimately nullified by the courts. =Background= Illinois' Cities and Villages Act of 1872 had moved municipal elections from November to April and had extended mayoral terms to two years. It went into effect in July 1872. On April 23, 1875, the city of Chicago had voted to operate under the Act, as opposed to operating under the rules outlined by its city charter. Since the act mandated mayoral elections to be held in April of odd-numbered years, incumbent mayor Harvey Doolittle Colvin believed that his term had been extended an additional year and that no elections were to be held in November 1875 or April 1876. He believed that a mayoral election would not be held until April 1877. =Election= Recognizing that Colvin would be unseated if a mayoral election were held, Chicago's city council (which was, at the time, composed of many members that were friendly towards the mayor) left the office of mayor off its list of offices for election. Thus, neither the Republican nor Democratic Parties believed they needed to put forth mayoral candidates, assuming that this meant that no mayoral election was scheduled to be held. Despite this Thomas Hoyne, president of the Chicago Public Library's board of directors, opted to run for mayor. He was nominated at a mass meeting and ran as an independent Democrat affiliated with the \\"Free Soilers Party\\". Thousands voted for Hoyne by writing his name on their ballots. Additionally, both the Democratic and Republican parties put him on their tickets.History of Cook County, Illinois--: Being a General Survey of Cook County, Volume 2 edited by Weston Arthur Goodspeed, Daniel David Healy (pg 576) He won nearly all of the votes cast for mayor in the municipal election held on April 16, 1876. However, a mayoral election had not been formally called for by the City Council or the mayor's office. =Results= Despite there being no authorization for such a count to be taken, a popular vote count of the mayoral write-in votes was taken when ballots were counted in Chicago's municipal elections. However, the city council ignored this count when it canvassed and made official the election results. Legal dispute The city council which had been elected in a (non- disputed) April election (in which many Colvin allies lost their seats) took office on April 8. On its first day the new city council declared that Hoyne was the city's mayor, that the vote that had been taken for mayor was actually binding. Hoyne took an oath of office on May 9 and attempted to assume the office of mayor. However, Colvin disputed Hoyne's claim to the office, arguing that the election had been illegitimate and that he was still entitled to serve an additional year as mayor. The City Council and most departments of the municipal government supported Hoyne's claim to the mayoral office. However, the city's comptroller and police department rejected Hoyne's claim, and supported Colvin in the resulting standoff. During the city standoff, the police blocked Hoyne from going inside the mayor's office at city hall. Meanwhile, with the support of the City Council, Hoyne fired supporters of Colvin from municipal jobs. Both men offered to possibly resign, but neither actually acted on their offers. =Outcome= Ultimately, after a 28-day conflict, the dispute was resolved by the courts. At a June 5 meeting of the Circuit Court of Cook County, William K. McAllister ruled that the April election had been illegitimate. This meant that Hoyne's \\"tenure\\" as mayor had been annulled. Colvin was permitted to extend his mayoral term until a special election would be held. A special election was ultimately held on July 12, electing Monroe Heath as mayor. Subsequently, in August, it was requested for city attorney to issue an opinion on whether or not Hoyne and the municipal apartment heads he had appointed should receive any remuneration. It was opined that, while Hoyne had not been mayor de jure, he had served as mayor de facto, thus he and his appointees should be awarded payment for the time they acted in their positions. July special election In the Chicago mayoral special election of 1876, Monroe Heath defeated Democrat Mark Kimball and independent J. J. McGrath by a landslide 39-point margin. The election was held on July 12, 1876 and had been called for as part of the Circuit Court of Cook County ruling that had been issued to resolve the dispute over the legitimacy of the disputed election that had been held in April. At a July 1 convention, the Republican party, which had supported (Democratic-leaning) Thomas Hoyne in the dispute over the 1876 election, opted to nominate their own candidate for the special election. They believed that the April 1876 aldermanic elections, which had seen a Republican landslide, indicated strong prospects of a Republican candidate winning the special mayoral election. Thus, they nominated Monroe Heath for mayor. Heath was a \\"Reform\\" Republican. Mark Kimball was nominated by the Democratic Party. Kimball was a successful businessman, as well as the South Town tax collector.Annual Report of the Comptroller of the City of ChicagoHistory of Chicago, Illinois, Volume 1, Part 2 By John Moses (pg. 643-644) He had first made a name for himself in the insurance business, serving separate tenures as director, secretary, and assignee for the Mutual Security Insurance company as well as tenures as the president and manager of the Citizens Insurance Company of Chicago. He had also led a successful career in banking and other business. J. J. McGrath ran as an Democratic-leaning independent aligned with Colvin's politics. Chicago voters, rebuking Colvin, elected Republican Monroe Heath in a landslide. =Results= Heath won a landslide victory. His margin of victory was roughly 39 points, a percentage which itself was significantly greater than either of Kimball's opponents' vote shares.

It is native to Brazil, Colombia, Ecuador, French Guiana, Guyana, Peru, Suriname and Venezuela. Jean Baptiste Christophore Fus√©e Aublet, the French botanist who first formally described the species using the basionym Annona longifolia, named it after its long-leaved ( and in Latin) foliage. Description It is a tree or bush. It has very short petioles. Its oblong leaves are 25 by 8 centimeters and come to a long tapering point at their tip. The upper surface of the leaves is hairless, while the underside has sparse hairs. Its flowers are extra-axillary, and occur alone or in pairs. The flowers are on long pedicels. The pedicels have 1‚Äì2 bracteoles. Its sepals are partially fused to form a 3-lobed calyx. The outer surface of the calyx is covered in rust- colored hairs. Its flowers have 6 purple, oval to oblong, petals in two rows of three. Its flowers have numerous stamens. The outer stamens are sterile and have a petal-like appearance. The inner stamens are fertile and the tissue connecting the anther lobes extends to form a cap.

She went on to use this research to help push through legislation to reduce plastic consumption. Early life and education Barrows grew up in Stonington, Maine, a town on the island of Deer Isle, off the coast of Maine. She participated in Hurricane Island, Outward Bound USA school at the age of sixteen. Barrows graduated in 2006 with a bachelor's degree in zoology with a focus on marine biology from the University of Tasmania, Australia. After returning to Stonington, Maine, Barrows completed her master's degree in microplastics from the College of the Atlantic in Bar Harbor, Maine in 2018. Life and career Barrows' biological studies led her to travel much of the world including Papua New Guinea, the Himalaya, and South and Central America. She later focused her studies on microplastics, having recognized plastic pollution as a global issue. Barrows directed global microplastic pollution research from 2013‚Äì2017, and consequently published research in collaboration with the Shaw Institute. She works with Adventure Scientists, an organization that links researchers with outdoorsmen and women.

It was founded by the Passionist Congregation in 1858. It is a grade II listed building. History It was in 1858 that St Joseph's was first established by Father Ignatius Spencer, who had converted to the Roman Catholic Church and entered the Passionist Order. He had found the location in Highgate in the Old Black Dog Inn, with a chapel in the ground floor and accommodation for the community on the floor above. The first church was built in 1861/63 by John Bird of Hammersmith but this proved to be too small, and the current church was started in 1888. The new church opened in 1889 by the Bishop of Liverpool, to commemorate the Jubilee of Pope Leo XIII; it was not consecrated until 1932 when the debt had been cleared. St. Joseph‚Äôs Church was designed by the architect Albert Vicars as blend of the Romanesque and Byzantine styles. The green, copper dome is the dominant feature and is a landmark that can be seen from various points across London. The dome is estimated to weigh 2000 tons. St Joseph‚Äôs Retreat, the house for the Passionist community, is attached to the east end. Interior The Stations of the Cross are large painted oblong reliefs by F. Devriendt, installed in 1886. =The Sanctuary= The sanctuary The high altar has a canopy (or baldachino), made from Sicilian marble. The surrounds and dome of the tabernacle are a copy of the original wooden surrounds from 1861. The mosaic pavement in the sanctuary is made from rock from the bed of the River Severn. The forward altar of marble and sandstone was erected in 1964 by Gerald Murphy of Burles Newton & Partners. The sanctuary wall paintings are by C. Langlin. =The Chapels= The northeast chapel is dedicated to the Passionist saints and has a painting of the St Paul of the Cross by M.A. Laby. The Lady chapel is from 1958, the altar is of plain marble with a marble reredos with mosaics showing the Annunciation and Coronation of Mary. The Carrara marble statue of the Virgin (1897) is by Porter of Fulham and is from the earlier chapel. Next to the chapel is a wooden sculpture of St Dominic Barberi by John O‚ÄôRourke (1999). The Sacred Heart chapel is at the southeast. In St Michael‚Äôs Chapel the marble rails and elaborate altar were reputedly exhibited at the Paris Exhibition of 1889. The chapel was erected in memory of Rev. Michael Watts Russell, who died 1875, and there is a marble portrait plaque to him. The reliquary is said to have been designed by Cardinal Wiseman. The Martyrs Chapel has a marble altar and rails, and an oil painting of the Forty Martyrs of England and Wales. =The Painted Ceiling= The segmental, vaulted ceiling was painted by Nathaniel Westlake (1891) and is some of his finest work. There are 250 panels, each segment contains an angel carrying a scroll with a verse from the Te Deum. =The Organ= The four-manual organ was built by William Hill & Sons in 1898 and installed after the Second World War as a memorial to the local victims of the Second World War. =Stained Glass= There are three stained glass clerestory windows on each side wall. Those on the south show the Crucifixion and those on the north the Holy Family. Between the windows are paintings by Westlake depicting the Mysteries of the Rosary.

They may number no more than a few hundred to at most a few thousand. They are believed to be related to, possibly descended from, the Oromo-speaking Waata. They are variously reported to speak Duruma, Digo, a similar Mijikenda dialect of their own, or to speak Mijikenda with grammatical errors (such as incorrect verb tenses) much as the Waata do when they speak Mijikenda. A former arrow-poison trader reported that when he visited the Degere at Mkoseka in northern Tanzania in 1959, among themselves they spoke their own language, which he said was similar to Waata. He was able, with difficulty, to recall some words and phrases, along with their Waata equivalents, and equated the language with both Waata and the language of the 'Dorobo' hunter-gatherers on the other side of the Usambara Mountains.By this he might have been referring to Aasax/Aramanik. (Walsh 1990) Half of the words were clearly related to Waata, though with some differences in pronunciation and meaning, but the rest were obscure and could not be identified with a known language, though this was complicated by the difficulty of recall, and possibility that errors or distortions crept in over time. The more obscure of these words, remembered nearly 30 years later, include,Martin Walsh, 1990. The Degere: Forgotten hunter-gatherers of the East African Coast. Cambridge Anthropology 14: 68‚Äì81. :sako 'girl' (i.e., before having children) :sakaya 'woman' (with children) :gobina 'blood' :mada 'meat' :matÃ†indo 'milk' :bulabula 'bee' Walsh (1990, 1992/1993) concludes it is possible that the former Degere language was a variety of Oromo that had been influenced by a still earlier language of theirs, or by the language of the hunter-gathering neighbors. The Waata say they had a language of their own before shifting to Oromo, so another possibility is that the Degere split from the Waata and traveled south, away from Oromo influence, before that shift was complete, and so retained part of that earlier language in their lexicon. The name 'Degere' is the root of the Mijikenda name, mudegere (sg) / adegere (pl), from the verb kudegere 'to roam', presumably reflecting their former hunter-gatherer economy. The establishment of the Mkomazi Game Reserve in Tanzania in 1951 may have accelerated their abandonment of hunting.Martin Walsh, 1992/1993.

It won the Sidewise Award for Alternate History for best short form work in 2018. Plot The story is set in October 1944 during a different version of World War II, although those differences are not immediately clear. The POV character is Joseph Stieglitz, a Hauptsturmf√ºhrer of the SS, stationed in Hungary shortly after Germany invaded the country and replaced Miklos Horthy with Ferenc Sz√°lasi. Stieglitz is hopeful that Sz√°lasi and his Arrow Cross Party will be motivated to fight off the Red Army, which has just crossed the country's eastern border. In the meantime, Stieglitz is tasked with rounding up a village of Romani people (called Zigeuner in German), in western Hungary, consistent with the Nazi Party's real life efforts to exterminate the Roma. It is revealed that the alternate timeline at play when a Hungarian driver describes Adolf Hitler's service in the Austria-Hungarian Army on the Eastern Front of World War I. As Stieglitz arranges for the Romani village's population to be placed on a train for occupied Poland, and, implicitly, their deaths, he further reflects on Hitler's antiziganism, which developed on the Eastern Front in part because of the efforts of Romani on behalf of Russia (who he reportedly saw stealing horses, telegraph wire and boots, leading to unnecessary deaths and injuries of German troops). Moreover, Hitler became sympathetic to the Jews after witnessing the Russians abuse them. Thus, in this timeline, the Nazis are actually accepting of Jewish people, while the Romani, communists, and homosexuals are the focus of Hitler's wrath. The story ends with the whole Romani village being deported. The narration reveals that Stieglitz is actually a secular Jew. He encounters a field rabbi, who reminds Stieglitz that their people have been made to suffer as much as the Romani have, and that Stieglitz could have just as easily wound up on the train. Stieglitz angrily threatens the rabbi, and then goes about his business. Award Nomination Zigeuner won the 2017 Sidewise Award for Alternate History Short Form award.

Along with her sister, Satenik, she attended high school in Philippopolis, Bulgaria. At a young age, she became inspired by revolutionary ideas of Rostom and his wife Lisa Melik Shahnazarian, who were operating an Armenian school there. When she returned home to Edirne, at sixteen, she met , an intellectual and member of the Armenian Revolutionary Federation, also known as the Dashnaktsutyun. He encouraged her to start the Armenian Women's Union, (), an organization to encourage other women to write and discuss Armenian literature and progressive ideas. Resuming her studies, Partizpanyan attended college in Geneva studying literature and pedagogy. She began to publish writings under the pseudonym Etna, including several short stories which would later be compiled and published as ’ì’∏’©’∏÷Ä’´’Ø’ß’∂ ’æ’•÷Ä’ª (The End of the Storm). Career After completing her education, Partizpanyan returned to Turkey and began teaching first in Van and then in Giresun. In 1909, she married Sargis Barseghyan, who had become the head of the Dashnaktsutyun in Constantinople. They would have a son before Sargis was arrested in March 1915 and executed on 30 April by the state as one of the first victims of the Armenian Genocide. After the massacre of intellectuals, Barseghyan took her son and fled to Sofia, Bulgaria, but soon settled in Tbilisi and resumed teaching. She taught at and later at , both Armenian schools located in the capital of the Tiflis Governorate, of the Caucasus Viceroyalty of the Russian Empire. When Armenia gained its independence from the Russian Empire and established the First Republic of Armenia on 28 May 1918, Barseghyan moved to Yerevan. Though not a women's right's activist, Barseghyan believed in public roles for women and along with other members of the Dashnaktsutyun worked to ensure that the new constitution provided for universal suffrage. She was socially active and worked with other women to provide care for orphans and refugees. When the first elections were held on 21 and 23 June 1919, Barseghyan was one of three women elected to serve in the 80-member parliament. The other two women who served were Varvara Sahakyan and Katarine Zalyan-Manukyan. They served until December 1920, when Red Army of Russia invaded Armenia. With the collapse of the Republic, Barseghyan took her son and returned briefly to Sofia. Committed to serving on behalf of the Armenian people, she chose to live in exile in Paris, where she worked at the Nansen International Office for Refugees and continued her literary endeavors. One of her short stories received an award from the American anthologist, Edward J. O'Brien, and stories like ‘±÷Ä÷É’´’Ø’® (Arpik) and ’ï’≤’°’Ø ’¥’® ’∑’≤’©’°’µ’ß’Ω (One Ring Chain) were translated into English and French. She published her memoirs, ‘Ω’°’∂’±’∏÷Ç’°’Æ ÷Ö÷Ä’•÷Ä’® (Days of Distress), as a series in the American journal Hairenik between 1938 and 1939. Death and legacy Barseghyan died on 18 May 1940 in Paris and was buried there in the tomb of Armenian intellectuals. Her son translated her memoirs into French and published them in Marseille in 2004. In 2016, Hakob Palian, writer and journalist, edited a new publication of them for Hamazkayin Publishing House of Beruit in honor of the 100th anniversary of the Armenian Genocide. Her works, but especially her memoir, are significant representations of the historic interwar period in Armenia's struggle and the role women played in protecting the nation and people in their quest for independence.
