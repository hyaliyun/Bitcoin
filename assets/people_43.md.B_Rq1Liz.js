The communist party was neutral at first, following the Soviet Union's official view that the war was a struggle between imperialists, but changed to a policy of armed resistance against the German occupation of France after Germany invaded the Soviet Union in June 1941. Three groups were formed, consisting of party members, young communists and foreign workers. Early in 1942 they were merged to form the FTP, which undertook sabotage and assassinations of the occupation. The FTP became the best organized and most effective of the French Resistance groups. In March 1944, before the Allied forces returned to Normandy, the FTP was theoretically merged with the other Resistance groups. In practice, it retained its independence until the end of the war. Background Germany attacked the Soviet Union on 22 June 1941 in Operation Barbarossa. With this, the policy of the French Communist Party (Parti communiste fran√ßais, PCF) policy switched to support for armed struggle against the German occupiers. The National Front (Front national de l'ind√©pendance de la France) was created as a French Resistance movement in the northern area in June 1941. The Front national was theoretically independent of the PCF, but in reality it was dominated by the PCF. At first the objectives were mainly political, taking advantage of the unstable situation under the occupying German army. Charles Tillon was put in charge of military matters. On 2 August 1941 Albert Ouzoulias was put in charge of the Bataillons de la Jeunesse, fighting groups that were being created by the Jeunesses Communistes. Soon after, Arthur Dallidet introduced him to Eug√®ne H√©naff, who was responsible for the armed struggle under the direction of Tillon. In October 1941 the PCF decided to unify its armed groups into the Organisation Sp√©ciale. H√©naff joined the leadership of the PCF's Organisation Sp√©ciale, where he was responsible for coordinating between the various armed units. He was a member of the Comit√© militaire national, which became the Francs-tireurs et partisans fran√ßais (FTPF). FTP fighters at the camp of Roche-Saint-Secret-B√©conne in May 1943 Formation Rather than limit armed action to Communists, it was decided to create a non-Communist organization, the Francs-Tireurs et Partisans (FTP), under the Front national. The FTP was open to non-communists but operated under communist control. The FTP movement was seen as a way to increase the political influence of the Communist Party in the future government of France. A special issue of L'Humanit√© in February 1942 confirmed the existence of \\"partisans et de francs-tireurs\\" (partisans and free-shooters) to whom patriots should give aid and assistance. Another special issue in March 1942 urged people to form such groups to conduct guerrilla war and help the population defend itself against the \\"boches\\". The FTP was created in April 1942, led by Charles Tillon. On 3 April 1942 L'Humanit√© used the expression \\"Francs-Tireurs et Partisans\\" for the first time, and in following weeks reported acts of sabotage of war production and attacks against German soldiers and French collaborators. The paper began using the initials FTP in July 1942. The FTP's mandate was to sabotage railways and factories, punish collaborators and assassinate German soldiers. Organization A captured Resistance fighter in 1944. The German caption says \\"This communist leader is on the wanted list ... his papers prove his affiliation with terrorist groups.\\" The FTP unified three Communist organizations, the Bataillons de la Jeunesse, the Organisation Sp√©ciale and the Main-d'≈ìuvre immigr√©e (MOI). The FTP national committee was headed by Charles Tillon, commander in chief. Eug√®ne H√©naff was political commissioner of the force until May 1943, when he was replaced by . Albert Ouzoulias was in charge of operations, and Georges Beyer was responsible for armaments and recruitment. , a captain of the reserve, was Chief of Staff. He wrote some of the manuals on tactics and armament, but his main role was to act as liaison between the FTP and the Gaullist resistance groups. The inter-regional and departmental military committees reported to the central organization in groups of three, a basic principle in the communist Resistance. In the field, each group would consist of two groups of three or four men under a commander and his assistant. For as long as possible they would continue to work in their normal occupations, only coming together to undertake an operation and then if possible returning to their normal daily life. Ouzoulias was a proponent of quick strikes against carefully studied targets by small groups of fighters, who would then rapidly withdraw. He also drew up guidelines for urban warfare in which FTP units could attack greatly superior German forces and be protected while they withdrew. Tillon called this a strategy of \\"drops of mercury\\", through which the group could use surprise and mobility to achieve transient superiority before disappearing. The FTP-MOI (Francs-tireurs et partisans ‚Äì main-d'≈ìuvre immigr√©e) was created in the spring of 1942 with four detachments made up of communists of \\"immigrant\\" origin. Most of its fighters were Jews from France, Hungary, Romania or elsewhere in Europe. Some were former volunteers in the International Brigades of the Spanish Civil War (1936‚Äì39). Leaflets and publications were issued in Yiddish. Although integrated with the FTP, the FTP-MOI groups retained their autonomy, which caused problems at times. The FTP-MOI were aroused to violent reprisals against the Germans by the Vel' d'Hiv Roundup in July 1942 in which Jews in Paris and other parts of France were arrested, detained and then deported to be killed in the Auschwitz concentration camp. The violence of the FTP-MOI in their struggle for survival did not always coincide with the interests of the French people. They received little recognition in France after the war. History French r√©sistants firing in a skirmish during the battle for Paris The military strength of the communists was still relatively feeble at the end of 1941, but the rapid growth of the FTP ensured that French communists regained their reputation as an effective anti-fascist force. Arthur Dallidet was placed in charge of security. Dallidet was recognized talking to a woman in a cafe beside the Reuilly metro station on the evening on 28 February 1942. He was arrested, taken to La Sant√© Prison, chained, handcuffed and severely beaten. He did not reveal any information, but had been carrying a long list of names and addresses. This led to other arrests including \\"Betty\\" (Madeleine Passot), his most important liaison officer. Further names and addresses were found in Betty's apartment. Gradually the FTP developed a more military organization, with sections, companies and battalions, each containing three lower-level groups. There were often gaps in this paper organization. The FTP complained that the British and Gaullists were deliberately depriving them of arms, although more likely the problem was that they did not have the necessary contacts to arrange delivery. In November 1943 Joseph Epstein, the FTP Chief of Staff, was arrested and subjected to extreme torture, but revealed nothing. This was followed by a major police operation that largely destroyed the FTP's Paris organization. From the end of 1943 the national organization began to intensify preparation for a national uprising to support the expected Allied landings in Europe. By 1944, the FTP had an estimated strength of 100,000 men. In March 1944 General Charles de Gaulle placed all the French Forces of the Interior (Forces fran√ßaises de l'int√©rieur, FFI). under the authority of General Marie-Pierre K≈ìnig, but the FTP retained its de facto independence. During the Allied Normandy Campaign the FTP conducting delaying actions in the center and southwest of France against the German troops who had recalled to the battle zone. From June to August 1944 Ouzoulias coordinated the FTP's military action in the Paris region. Ouzoulias and Colonel Henri Rol-Tanguy, who led the √éle-de-France Resistance movement, planned a major rising in Paris which played a vital role during the August 1944 Liberation of Paris. On 28 August 1944 de Gaulle put Ouzoulias in charge of the FTP and the FFI. In the autumn of 1944 Ouzoulias was charged by de Gaulle with integrating the FTP members with the regular French army. In October 1944 the communist militias were dissolved and the FTP was integrated into General de Lattre's army.

On July 12, 2006, six photographers (Jerry Burchfield, Mark Chamberlain, Jacques Garnier, Rob Johnson, Douglas McCulloh, and Clayton Spada) unveiled what is currently the world's largest camera and photograph. The photograph was made to mark the end of 165 years of film/chemistry-based photography and the start of the age of digital photography. It was taken using a decommissioned Marine Corps jet hangar (Building #115 at El Toro) transformed into the world's largest camera to make the world's largest picture. The hangar-turned-camera recorded a panoramic image of what was on the other side of the door using the centuries-old principle of \\"camera obscura\\" or pinhole camera. An image of the former El Toro Marine Corps Air Station appeared upside down and flipped left to right on film after being projected through the tiny hole in the hangar's metal door.

In 1999, Hellemn created a 1.77 gigapixel underwater photocomposite image, which was designed to facilitate life-size reproduction of a 20 ft high by 70 ft wide section of Bloody Bay Wall, a vertical coral reef wall in the Cayman Islands. The image consisted of over 300 images that were manually stitched together from 4000ppi drum scans of Fuji Provia 100 transparency film. To make the image, a grid of 280 frames was photographed with 30% overlap to accurately cover the reef wall with full- spectrum light revealing the natural color and detail of the reef. Additional frames of marine life carefully photographed in the same grid composited in place to complete the scene. The on-site photography, requiring 23 dives and over 12 hours underwater to complete, was accomplished over a ten-day period by Jim Hellemn, with assistants Larry Hellemn and Peter Neubauer, using a neutrally-buoyant camera platform Hellemn designed specifically for the project. The post production of the image was completed in six months using multiple Macintosh G4 computers at Photographix in Poway, California, a digital graphics company owned by Hellemn. A zoomable version of the image was made available to the public in 2000 using the ER Mapper's ECW (file format) and Image Web Server software on a site operated by Fugro-Pelagos, allowing visitors to explore the life-size image. The project and the techniques used by Hellemn inspired researchers at Miami University to use similar methods to produce wide-coverage video mosaics to study coral reefs. The image was published in the October 2001 issue of National Geographic Magazine, \\"Portrait of a Coral Reef\\".

History  The Morning Press was founded by William J. Sproat and appeared on Monday, September 1, 1890. Mr. Sproat was its proprietor until November 5, 1891, when control passed to the Press Publishing company. Soon after, the controlling interest in the company was purchased by George G. Booth, who in 1892 bought the rival Grand Rapids Eagle and merged it with the Press. January 1, 1893, the Press went into the evening daily field, which it has since occupied. This newspaper at first was published at 63 Pearl Street. Then for a number of years it occupied a building on the Grand River at the southeast end of the Pearl Street bridge. In 1906 it moved to a new home at Fulton Street and Sheldon Avenue. The paper was published downtown at the corner of Monroe and Michigan until 2004 when the printing facility was moved to the northern suburb of Walker. The editorial and newsroom offices remain downtown. They hire aspiring journalists through an internship program. Since October 2009, the Press printing facility has been the printing facility for the Muskegon Chronicle. The Advance Newspapers are also printed at this facility, as is, since January 2012, the Kalamazoo Gazette. Home delivery for the Press, Chronicle and Gazette were cut back to Tuesdays, Thursdays and Sundays in 2012; on the other days in which the Grand Rapids Press is published, subscribers receive an e-edition of that day's newspaper.

Released in November 1971, it was the band's first album for RCA Records. The album is named after the Muswell Hill area of North London, where band leader Ray Davies and guitarist Dave Davies grew up and the band formed in the early 1960s. The album introduces a number of working class figures and the stresses with which they must contend. It did not sell well but received positive reviews and critical acclaim.  Recording  Muswell Hillbillies was the band's first album for RCA Records, their prior recordings having been released on Pye Records (Reprise Records in the United States). Their contract with Pye/Reprise expired the same year. The album was recorded between August and October 1971 at Morgan Studios, London, using a new brass section, the Mike Cotton Sound, which included Mike Cotton on trumpet, John Beecham on trombone and tuba, and Alan Holmes on clarinet.  Reception  The album was not a commercial success (it failed to chart in the United Kingdom and peaked at #48 in the U.S.), and its sales were a disappointment following the success of Lola the previous year. Stereo Review magazine called the poor-selling record \\"album of the year\\" in 1972 (even though it was released on 24 November 1971). In the 1984 Rolling Stone Album Guide, Rolling Stone editors gave the album five stars out of five and called it Davies' \\"signature statement\\" as a songwriter. In a retrospective review for Allmusic, Stephen Thomas Erlewine called the album a wide-ranging collection of Ray Davies compositions which focus on the tensions and frustrations of modern life. Re-releases A remastered deluxe edition of Muswell Hillbillies was released in the UK on 7 October 2013, with several bonus tracks, alternate takes, and BBC recordings all remastered by Andrew Sandoval and Dan Hersch. On 10 November 2014, a Legacy Edition was released for the United States, with disc 1 containing the remastered stereo album, and many of the UK Deluxe Edition bonus tracks remastered by Vic Anesini, while the second disc is a DVD with promotional TV performances (previously released in the UK on The Kinks At The BBC box set) from the era.  Cover art  The front cover picture was taken in the Archway Tavern, a pub in Archway (more than two miles away from Muswell Hill). The back inset picture, showing the band below a signpost giving directions to Muswell Hill, was taken on the small traffic island at the intersection of Castle Yard and Southwood Lane in Highgate.

Early life Philippe was born at York House, Twickenham, Middlesex, the son of Philippe, Count of Paris, by his wife (and first cousin), Princess Isabelle of Orl√©ans. He was baptised with the names Louis- Philippe-Robert, and was called Philippe. His family lived in England from the abdication and banishment of his great-grandfather Louis Philippe, King of the French, in 1848, and returned to France in 1871 following the fall of the Second French Empire. However, they again took refuge in England in 1886, when the French Republic exiled them following the wedding in Paris of Philippe's sister Am√©lie of Orl√©ans to Crown Prince Carlos of Portugal. Returning therefore to France in 1871 with his parents, Philippe was educated at home at the Ch√¢teau d'Eu and at the Coll√®ge Stanislas de Paris. His tutor from the end of 1882 to 1887 was Th√©odore Froment, previously a professor of Latin literature at Bordeaux. In 1880 Philippe's father granted him the title Duc d'Orl√©ans. On 16 June 1881, he received the sacrament of confirmation at Eu.The Times (17 June 1881): 5. Growing up to be tall and blond, he later grew a beard. He was a better athlete than scholar and learned to love mountain- climbing from Captain Morhain, a former soldier from Saint-Cyr who had become his father's accountant. Military career Philippe began his military education at the √âcole sp√©ciale militaire de Saint-Cyr. In June 1886 he was on the point of becoming an officer in the French army when his family was once again exiled by France's republican government. At first he was placed under the tutelage of a Colonel de Parseval, under whose supervision he would later attend a military academy in Lausanne. In Great Britain he entered the Royal Military College, Sandhurst, on the nomination of Queen Victoria in February 1887, completing his training there and developing an abiding interest in geography, topography, and the natural sciences. He was attached for service to the King's Royal Rifle Corps, which was then serving in British India, but never held an actual commission in the British Army, in order to respect a French law forbidding Frenchmen from holding commissions in foreign armies without the permission of the French head of state. Nevertheless, he was ranked as a sub-lieutenant and served in India from January 1888 to March 1889, where he was a staff-officer to Lord Roberts, then Commander-in-Chief in India. Philippe d'Orl√©ans In October 1889, Philippe went to Switzerland to complete a course in military theory. While there he fathered a son, Philippe Debien, by Nina, an actress working in the casino at Lausanne.Edward Hanson, Royalty Digest 4, 2012. On his 21st birthday in February 1890 he left Switzerland by train with his friend Honor√© d'Albert, 10th duc de Luynes, and entered Paris in violation of the law of exile of 1886. There, he offered to perform his military service, as required by law. Instead he was arrested and confined in the Conciergerie. He was sentenced to two years imprisonment at Clairvaux, but was released after a few months and expelled back to Switzerland. Drawn to explore the \\"unknown\\", Philippe asked Prince George, Duke of Cambridge, to send him to a military post in the Himalayas. While in the East, he undertook a hunting and exploratory expedition in Nepal with his cousin Prince Henri of Orl√©ans, went mountain-climbing in Tibet, and visited Afghanistan, Ceylon, and the Persian Gulf, before being posted back to Britain. Prior to his imprisonment in France, Philippe had been unofficially engaged to his first cousin Princess Marguerite of Orl√©ans,The Times ( 28 May 1889): 5, ( 31 May 1889): 5. but the engagement was cancelled when Philippe's involvement with the Australian opera singer Nellie Melba was revealed. Melba was still married to Charles Nesbitt Armstrong, although they had lived apart for some years. Armstrong filed for divorce from Melba on the grounds of adultery, naming Philippe as co-respondent; the case was eventually dropped.The Times ( 5 November 1891): 5, ( 6 November 1891): 9, ( 20 February 1892): 5, ( 17 February 1892): 13, ( 12 March 1892): 16, ( 14 March 1892): 3, ( 24 March 1892): 3. In September 1890, Philippe accompanied his father on a two-month trip to the United States and Canada.Voyage de Mgr le comte de Paris et de Mgr le duc d'Orl√©ans aux Etats-Unis et au Canada (Paris: Librairie nationale, 1891). They visited the battlefields of the American Civil War, in which his father had fought, as well as Philadelphia, Washington, D.C., Richmond, Virginia, New York City, and Quebec. On 12 November 1890, while in Philadelphia, Philippe joined the Pennsylvania Commandery of the Military Order of the Loyal Legion of the United States (MOLLUS) - a military society composed of officers who had served the Union in the American Civil War and their descendants, as a companion of the 2nd class - a membership category for the eldest sons of companions of the 1st class who were veteran officers. He was assigned MOLLUS insignia number 8262. Upon his father's death on 8 September 1894, he became a hereditary companion of the 1st class. In December 1890, Philippe applied unsuccessfully to serve in the Russian Army.The Times (2 January 1891): 7, (10 January 1891): 5. In March 1893, he was elected a Fellow of the Royal Geographical Society.The Times (29 March 1893): 9. In March 1894, Philippe went to Egypt and Palestine with his sister H√©l√®ne, Duchess of Aosta. Then he went lion shooting in Abyssinia (modern Ethiopia). In May 1894, he was attached to the Royal Buckinghamshire Hussars, a yeomanry regiment.The Times (1 June 1894): 10. Claimant to the throne Archduchess Maria Dorothea of Austria Upon the death of his father on 8 September 1894, Philippe became the Orl√©anist claimant to the French throne. He was known to monarchists as Philippe VIII. He was an active claimant, regularly issuing manifestos. In October 1895, Philippe was named as co-respondent in the divorce case of Woolston v. Woolston.The Times ( 29 October 1895): 4, ( 5 November 1895): 14. Unlike his great grandfather, Louis Philippe I, Philippe claimed grand mastership of the Order of the Holy Spirit as intrinsic to his dynastic claim to the throne, and sometimes wore the breast star of the order. On 5 November 1896, in Vienna, Philippe married Archduchess Maria Dorothea of Austria (1867‚Äì1932), a daughter of Archduke Joseph Karl of Austria, Palatine of Hungary, and granddaughter of Princess Cl√©mentine of Orl√©ans, as well as a niece of Marie Henriette of Austria, Queen Consort of the Belgians. There were no children from this marriage. The couple were poorly matched and after several years they lived apart. While travelling in Geneva in 1898, Philippe narrowly missed being assassinated by an anarchist, who vowed to kill the next member of a royal family that he saw. The victim would turn out to be the Empress Elisabeth of Austria, stabbed to death on the quayside. Philippe continued to reside in England until 1900, when he moved his primary residence to Belgium. He was an active yachtsman and explored parts of the western coast of Greenland in 1905 during his Duke of Orl√©ans Arctic Expedition. In 1907 he sailed in the Kara Sea north of Siberia, and in 1909 went even further north into the Arctic Ocean. He made a short film, Jaripeo y fiestas en Jalapa (\\"Jaripeo and Festivals in Jalapa\\"), during a trip to Mexico in 1910.\\"Mexican Cinema Could Have Started in Orizaba, There is an Important Amount of Filmography\\" Al Calor Pol√≠tico (16 February 2016); accessed 1 October 2018 (in Spanish) In 1914, Philippe and his wife Maria Dorothea were legally separated. She subsequently lived in Hungary. At the outbreak of the First World War, Philippe again tried unsuccessfully to join the French army. He was also refused permission to serve in the Belgian army and instead returned to the United Kingdom. A plan to join the Italian army was prevented by a serious accident in which he was knocked down by a bus. In 1926, Philippe died of pneumonia at the Palais d'Orl√©ans in Palermo, Sicily. Having no legitimate issue, he was succeeded as pretender to the throne of France by his cousin Jean, Duke of Guise.

She was named for Rear Admiral Charles Stewart. Construction Stewart was laid down on 24 January 1900, at Morris Heights, New York, by the Gas Engine and Power Company; launched on 10 May 1902; sponsored by Mrs. Paul Lee Cocke, granddaughter of Rear Admiral Stewart; and commissioned on 1 December 1902, Lieutenant Frederick A. Traut in command. Pre-World War I After commissioning, Stewart served for a short time at the Naval Academy and then joined the Coast Squadron of the North Atlantic Fleet. In 1906, she was placed in reserve at Norfolk, Virginia but was recommissioned in 1907 in the Atlantic Fleet and transferred in 1908 to the Pacific Fleet. As one of the first group of destroyers built in the United States, Stewart quickly became obsolete; and, on 24 February 1916, the Navy Department decided that destroyers numbered 1 through 16 were \\"no longer serviceable for duty with the fleet.\\" These ships were henceforth classed as \\"coast torpedo vessels\\", but this did not prevent Stewart from having an active career in World War I. World War I After the United States declared war on Germany on 6 April 1917, Stewart patrolled first off the Atlantic entrance to the Panama Canal and along the Colombian coast; and then, after 11 May, off the Pacific entrance to the canal. On 5 July, she returned to the Atlantic, and was fitted out at the Philadelphia Navy Yard from 22 July-11 August for distant service. On 13 August, she sailed for Bermuda with a destroyer flotilla; but, on arrival on 16 August, she grounded in the harbor and required repairs there and at Philadelphia, Pennsylvania which lasted through 10 October. On 11 October, Stewart began dispatch and escort duty from a base in the York River. Except for one interruption for training, this duty continued until 31 December 1917, when she entered the Philadelphia yard to fit out again for distant service. Departing the yard on 15 January 1918, Stewart sailed the next day for Europe in company with , , , and . Stopping in the Azores from 29 January-4 February, Stewart and Worden arrived at Brest, France, on the 9th and began convoy escort duty off that port on the 17th. On 17 April, as Stewart entered Quiberon Bay, an American steamer, Florence H, with a cargo of powder and steel, exploded in the anchorage. Stewart saved nine survivors, and her crew was cited by the Secretary of the Navy for gallantry during the rescue. On 23 April, Stewart sighted two seaplanes dropping bombs, apparently on a submarine; and she raced to the spot. One aircraft flew over the destroyer, and the observer pointed to the location of the sub. Stewart saw first the sub's wake, then its periscope, and finally the dark form of her hull underwater. She was forced to turn away at the last moment due to the effort of a French escort to ram the sub, but dropped two depth charges which brought up large amounts of oil. The action was evaluated at the time as a kill; but the submarine, U-108, survived to be damaged by several days later and finally to surrender at Harwich at the end of the war. During a dense fog three days later, Stewart was damaged when she collided with an unidentified merchantman, and she remained under repair until 28 May. On 4 August, the destroyer made another attack on an apparent submarine wake, but obtained no evidence of success. Inter-war period After the armistice ending World War I was signed on 11 November, Stewart ceased convoy duty; and she entered drydock at Brest on 26 November for repairs. On 9 December, she departed Brest with four other destroyers; and, after passing the convoy carrying President Woodrow Wilson to Europe two days later and subsequently making stops at the Azores and Bermuda, the destroyers arrived at Philadelphia on 3 January 1919. Decommissioned on 9 July, Stewart was struck from the Naval Vessel Register on 15 September, and sold on 3 January 1920 to Joseph G. Hitner Company, Philadelphia, for scrap.

Its central character, Sir Giles Over-reach, became one of the more popular villains on English and American stages through the 19th century.Ball, p. 3. Performance Massinger probably wrote the play in 1625, though its debut on stage was delayed a year as the theatres were closed due to bubonic plague. In its own era it was staged by Queen Henrietta's Men at the Cockpit Theatre in Drury Lane. It was continuously in the repertory there and at the Red Bull Theatre, under the managements of Christopher Beeston, William Beeston, and Sir William Davenant, down to the closing of the theatres at the start of the English Civil War in 1642. Though Massinger's play shows obvious debts to Thomas Middleton's A Trick to Catch the Old One (c. 1605), it transcends mere imitation to achieve a powerful dramatic effectiveness ‚Äì verified by the fact that, apart from the Shakespearean canon, it was almost the only pre-Restoration play that was continuously in the dramatic repertory through much of the modern era. After David Garrick's 1748 revival, the play remained popular throughout the nineteenth century and into the twentieth. (It was praised by Thomas Jefferson.) Edmund Kean's version of Sir Giles, which debuted in 1816, was in particular a tremendous popular success, and drove the play's reputation through the remainder of the century.Gibson, p. 184. The play remains in the active theatrical repertory; modern stagings are usually amateur or student productions, though the Royal Shakespeare Company performed the play in 1983, directed by Adrian Noble and with Emrys James as Sir Giles. Publication The play was first published in 1633 in quarto by stationer Henry Seyle (his shop was \\"in S. Pauls Church-yard, at the signe of the Tygers head\\"). The 1633 quarto carries a dedication of \\"this trifle\\" to Robert Dormer, 1st Earl of Carnarvon, Master Falconer of England (he'd succeeded to his hereditary title, Chief Avenor and Keeper of the King's Hawks and Falcons, at the age of six). In this dedication, Massinger states that he \\"born a devoted servant to the thrice noble family of your incomparable Lady,\\" that lady being Anna Sophia Herbert, daughter of Philip Herbert, 4th Earl of Pembroke, then serving as Lord Chamberlain. Massinger's connection to the Herbert family, derived from his father, is well known; whether Carnarvon responded in any positive way to the dedication is obscure. The 1633 quarto was the only edition of the play in the seventeenth century. Its later popularity onstage guaranteed frequent reprints, with 52 editions between 1748 and 1964 (not counting collections); others have followed since.Gibson, p. 185. Genre Dramaturgically, the play A New Way to Pay Old Debts contains elements of melodrama, comedy of manners, realism, and social satire, in a distinctive combination. The villain The play also falls into the category of the \\"villain play\\", a drama in which the dominant figure is not a traditional protagonist or hero but his antagonist, a figure of evil. In the context of English Renaissance drama, the villain play grew out of the \\"ranting Herod\\" of the Medieval morality play. In the Elizabethan era, Christopher Marlowe was the great innovator in the villain play, with Tamburlaine, Doctor Faustus, and The Jew of Malta; Shakespeare's Richard III is another obvious example in the subgenre. In A New Way to Pay Old Debts, Massinger took the villain play in a new direction of social realism: his villain is not a king or a conqueror but a credible figure from contemporary life. The play's dominating character, Sir Giles Over-reach, is based on the real-life Sir Giles Mompesson. (Sir Giles' assistant in villainy, Justice Greedy, was suggested by Mompesson's associate Sir Francis Michell.) The power of the role of Sir Giles may lie in Massinger's success in depicting a blatant villain who has a quality of everyday believability. Sir Giles is down-to-earth in his cold malice: The audience is presented with a character they might meet in their own lives, to their own cost. Class conflict The play illustrates the hardening of class distinctions that characterised the early Stuart era, leading up to the outbreak of the Civil War.Logan and Smith, pp. 95‚Äì6. In Elizabethan plays like The Shoemaker's Holiday (1599), it was acceptable and even admirable that a young nobleman marry a commoner's daughter; other plays of the era, like Fair Em (c. 1590) and The Merry Wives of Windsor (c. 1597‚Äì9), share this liberal attitude toward social mobility through marriage. In A New Way to Pay Old Debts, in contrast, Lord Lovell would rather see his family line go extinct than marry Over-reach's daughter Margaret, even though she is young, beautiful, and virtuous. In Act IV, scene i, Lovell specifies that his attitude is not solely dependent on his loathing of the father's personal vices, but is rooted in class distinction. Lovell rejects the idea of his descendants being \\"one part scarlet\\" (aristocratic) and \\"the other London blue\\" (common).Gurr, pp. 15‚Äì16. The drama's class conflict can seem obscure to the modern reader, since Sir Giles Over-reach appears as an upper-class, not a lower-class figure: he is a knight and a rich man with large country estates, who lives the lavish lifestyle of the landed gentry. There is even a family connection between hero and villain: Frank Welborn is the nephew of Sir Giles' late wife. Yet Sir Giles himself expresses the conflict by noting that he is a \\"city\\" man‚Äîhe comes from the financial milieu of the City of London with its worldly and materialistic values, the domain of nascent capitalism in contrast to the older social order rooted in feudalism. He observes that there is \\"More than a feud, a strange antipathy / Between us\\", the men of money, \\"and true gentry\\".Martin Butler, \\"A New Way to Pay Old Debts: Massinger's grim comedy,\\" in Cordner, Holland, and Kerrigan, pp. 119‚Äì36. For a conservative moralist like Massinger, the upper classes, the \\"true gentry\\", have a right to run society insofar as they fulfil the moral and ethical obligations of their traditional roles. It is Over-reach's rejection of those tradition moral and ethical standards, his embrace of ruthless competition, that makes him a villain. Synopsis Set in rural Nottinghamshire, the play opens with its protagonist, Frank Welborn, being ejected from an alehouse by Tapwell and Froth, the tavernkeeper and his wife. Welborn has been refused further service (\\"No booze? nor no tobacco?\\"); he quarrels with the couple and beats them, but is interrupted by Tom Allworth. The conversations in the scene supply the play's backstory, indicating that Welborn and Allworth are both members of the local gentry who have fallen victim to the financial manipulations of Sir Giles Over-reach. Welborn has lost his estates and been reduced to penury, while young Allworth has been forced to become the page of a local nobleman, Lord Lovell. Allworth offers Welborn a small sum, \\"eight pieces\\", to relieve his immediate wants, but Welborn indignantly rejects the offer from a junior contemporary; he says that as his own vices have led to his fall, he will rely on his own wits for his recovery. Tom Allworth's widowed mother, Lady Allworth, retains her country house; she is visited there by neighbours and prospective suitors, including Sir Giles. While she has her servants greet these guests with appropriate hospitality, she remains \\"cloister'd up\\" in the seclusion of her mourning. When Sir Giles visits, he is accompanied by his two prime henchmen, the lawyer Jack Marall and Justice Greedy, the local justice of the peace. Together, Greedy and the Lady's servants provide most of the play's comic relief. Greedy is a lean man with an enormous appetite; a gourmand and a glutton, he is obsessed with food.A modern reader might suspect that Greedy suffers from a tapeworm infection. Lady Allworth instructs her son to avoid the dissolute Welborn; but Welborn forces his way into her presence, and reminds her of his relationship with her late husband. When the late Allworth had been down on his luck, Welborn had supported him, even seconding him in all his duels. The recollection makes Lady Allworth repent her harsh attitude toward the reprobate Welborn, and she offers him financial help; he rejects this, but requests a favour of her instead. The request is made in a whisper; the audience discovers its nature as the plot progresses. Over-reach is shown with Marall, discussing his plan to marry his daughter Margaret to Lord Lovell. He also gives a first glimpse into the ruthless way he conducts his business affairs. Welborn seeks out Over-reach, but Sir Giles refuses to speak with him; Marall mocks his poverty. Yet Marall has to change his tune when he sees Lady Allworth come out of mourning to meet Welborn. When she kisses Welborn, Marall is convinced that the two will marry. When Marall informs Over-reach of what he's seen, however, Over-reach refuses to believe him, and even beats him. Eventually, though, Over-reach himself sees Welborn and Lady Allworth together, and accepts the \\"truth\\" of their connection. Sir Giles favours their marriage, since he is sure that once Welborn possesses the Lady's remaining property he can cheat the dissolute man of this property too. Margaret Over- reach has no interest in marrying Lord Lovell, since she is in love with Tom Allworth, as he is with her. Lord Lovell knows of his page's affections, and is willing to act as a go-between for the two. Young Allworth is nervous at this, suspecting that his patron will not be able to resist Margaret's charms; but Lovell is an honourable man, and sincerely promotes their match. Over- reach thinks that Allworth is carrying messages between the Lord and his daughter, though the young page is actually pursuing his own romance. Together, the young couple manages to fool Sir Giles into thinking that Lovell wants a reluctant Margaret to elope with him; Over-reach pressures his daughter to conform, and even sends hurried written instructions to a compliant clergyman at the village of Gotham, to marry his daughter to \\"this man.\\" Of course he means Lovell, though the ambiguity favours the young lovers. To facilitate the marriage of Welborn and Lady Allworth, Sir Giles advances Welborn a thousand pounds. He also discusses his plans with Lovell, revealing more of his intentions and his dark character, so that Lovell breaks into a \\"cold sweat\\" listening to him. (With each of his appearances in the play, Over-reach's expressions of his villainy become more flagrant and overwrought, leading up to the denouement of the final scene.) Marall sees Welborn's apparent ascension in fortune, and, chafing at Over-reach's insulting and brutal treatment of him, decides to switch allegiances; his command of Over-reach's legal papers gives Marall a key advantage in seeking his own revenge. When Over-reach believes that Lovell and Margaret are married, he enters a state of near rapture: \\"My ends! my ends are compass'd! . . . I can scarce contain myself, / I am so full of joy; nay, joy all over!\\" The play's final scene shows his sudden reversal, when he realises that he has been fooled and that Margaret has married Allworth. Enraged, he demands that Welborn provide security for the loan of ¬£1000 from the Lady's estates; Welborn rejects this, and demands that Over-reach return possession of his lands. Sir Giles dismisses this as folly‚Äîbut discovers that the text of his deed to Welborn's lands has mysteriously faded away (thanks to the trickery of Marall). Over-reach is ready to work his revenge with his sword, but Welborn, Lovell, and the Lady's servants altogether are too formidable for him. He storms out, but returns in a distracted state of mind. The stresses of his reversal of fortune have caused him to lose his sanity, and he is taken into protective custody. Welborn decides to demonstrate his reformation by taking a military commission in the regiment Lovell commands. Lovell and Lady Allworth have agreed to marry. Allworth and Margaret state that they will turn control of Over-reach's estates to Lord Lovell, to make reparations for all to the people Sir Giles has cheated and oppressed. Critical responses The play's prominence in theatrical history has won it the attention of scholars and critics.Neill, pp. 73‚Äì99.Smith, Strier, and Bevington, pp. 183‚Äì208. Some of the criticism has been favourable; one editor judged it \\"a highly finished, integrated piece of work, with everything handsomely symmetrical about it.\\"Muriel St. Claire Byrne, quoted in Logan and Smith, pp. 96‚Äì7. Yet critics have not been shy about finding faults; one called Sir Giles Over-reach \\"the character whom his author could not control.\\"D. J. Enright, quoted in Logan and Smith, p. 97. Massinger's blending of lighter dramatic materials, like comedy of intrigue, with the play's more serious aspects, has also been faulted.Alexander Leggatt, cited in Logan and Smith, p. 96.

Retrieved June 24, 2012. While attending Syracuse at a then 255-pounds, Freeney was clocked at 4.40 second 40-yard dash and recorded 40-inch vertical jump. His 40-yard time remains among the fastest ever recorded for a defensive lineman. Freeney still returns to Syracuse for his summer workouts, and serves as mentor to Syracuse players, including former walk-on Josh Arrington from the 2006‚Äì2008 season. Professional career =2002 NFL Combine= =Indianapolis Colts= Freeney was selected by the Indianapolis Colts with the 11th selection in the 2002 NFL Draft. He set an NFL rookie record in 2002 with 9 forced fumbles, three of which occurred in a single game against former Syracuse football player, Donovan McNabb. Freeney was the runner up for the NFL Defensive Rookie of the Year award. When drafted by Indianapolis at 270 lbs, Freeney was clocked at 4.48 seconds in the 40-yard dash and the same 40 inch vertical jump. In 2004, Freeney's third season, he led the NFL with 16 sacks. At the end of his third season, Freeney's season marked him as the 3rd fastest player to achieve 40 sacks. He developed a spin move which became his trademark pass rush move. In 2006, Freeney helped the Colts defeat the Chicago Bears in Super Bowl XLI to become NFL Champions. Freeney attempts to sack Michael Vick at the 2006 Pro Bowl. On February 19, 2007, the Colts placed the franchise tag on Freeney following the expiration of his rookie contract. This move allowed Bill Polian and the Colts front office time to work on a long term contract. On July 13, 2007 Freeney signed a six-year, $72 million contract with $30 million in guarantees making Freeney one of the highest paid defensive players in the NFL. Freeney was fined $20,000 by the NFL for his expletive-laced interview following the end of the Colts 2008‚Äì09 playoff campaign which ended with a 23-17 overtime playoff loss to the San Diego Chargers. The NFL cited Freeney for making \\"inappropriate comments on officiating,\\" according to the Indianapolis Star. Freeney, frustrated by the three defensive penalties incurred as the Chargers made their game-winning drive, told Yahoo! Sports after the game: \\"Those were the worst [expletive] calls I've seen in a long time ... To have a game of that magnitude taken out of your hands, it's just disgusting. It's not like they made one [expletive] bad call -- it's three calls, in overtime ... They need to start investigating some other [expletive].\\" In 2012, Freeney converted from defensive end to outside linebacker under new head coach Chuck Pagano.Freeney: I'm not like LeBron trying to leave the team-Pro Football Talk Retrieved August 24, 2012. Due to injury and not adjusting to his position-change well, Freeney struggled and finished the season with only five sacks and 12 tackles. On February 15, 2013, Freeney was told he would not be re-signed by the Colts. Freeney left as the all-time franchise leader in sacks with 107.5, but was surpassed by former teammate Robert Mathis the next season. Mathis would also break Freeney's franchise season record of 16 sacks the following season, too, when he tallied 19.5. =San Diego Chargers= On May 18, 2013, Freeney signed a two-year deal with the San Diego Chargers. During the 2013 season, Freeney suffered a season-ending injury and recorded a career low with 0.5 sacks. In 2014, Freeney looked to bounce back from the previous year and did. Throughout the season, Freeney was only used as a pass rush specialist coming out only on passing downs. Against the Seattle Seahawks Freeney sacked Russell Wilson, which contributed to a Chargers victory. The next week, Freeney got a sack against the Buffalo Bills. Against the 49ers, Dwight Freeney and Ricardo Mathews sacked and forced a Colin Kaepernick fumble leading to a Chargers touchdown. The next week recorded one sack against Chase Daniel and the Chiefs. Freeney finished the season with 10 tackles, 3.5 sacks, and a pass deflect. =Arizona Cardinals= On October 12, 2015, Freeney signed a one- year, $870,000 deal with the Arizona Cardinals, with the incentive to receive a $200,000 bonus with four sacks and then would receive $100,000 for each sack thereafter, with a maximum of 12. Freeney was named NFC Defensive Player of the Week for Week 16, in which he had three sacks and a forced fumble, the first time he had three sacks in a game since 2006. Coincidentally, former Colts teammate Robert Mathis won AFC Defensive Player of the Week for the same week. Freeney appeared in nine games during the 2015 season, totaling 8.0 sacks (leading the team) and three forced fumbles. =Atlanta Falcons= Freeney with the Falcons in 2016 On August 2, 2016, Freeney signed a one-year deal with the Atlanta Falcons. He played in 15 games, totaling three sacks. The Falcons won the NFC Championship to advance to Super Bowl LI, bringing Freeney to his third career Super Bowl. Freeney had one sack in the big game, although the Falcons lost to the Patriots by a score of 34‚Äì28. =Seattle Seahawks= On October 24, 2017, Freeney signed a one-year deal with the Seattle Seahawks. After playing in four games recording three sacks, Freeney was released by the Seahawks on November 21, 2017. =Detroit Lions= On November 22, 2017, Freeney was claimed off waivers by the Detroit Lions. =Retirement= Freeney announced his retirement on April 19, 2018, after signing a ceremonial one-day contract with the Colts to retire as a member of the team he spent the majority of his career with. =Career statistics= { class=\\"wikitable sortable\\" style=\\"text-align:center\\" - !

Early life & studies  The Matthew home at 43 Minto Street, Edinburgh Robert Matthew was the son of John Fraser Matthew (1875‚Äì1955) (also an architect, and the partner of Sir Robert Lorimer) and his wife, Annie Broadfoot Hogg. From 1920, the family lived at 43 Minto Street ironically the epitome of Georgian classicism rather than modern architecture. Robert was born and brought up in Edinburgh, was educated at Edinburgh Institution and attended the Edinburgh College of Art where he studied under John Begg. Family life In 1931 Matthew married Lorna Pilcher. They had three children: Robert Aidan Matthew, born in July 1936, Janet Frances Catriona Matthew, born in March 1939, and Jessie Ann Matthew born in June 1952. From 1939 they lived at 12 Darnaway Street, Edinburgh and from 1956 they lived at Keith Marischal House, Humbie, East Lothian.  Career  Robert was apprenticed with his father's firm. Then in 1936, he joined the Department of Health for Scotland, as assistant to John Wilson,Dictionary of Scottish Architects: John Wilson where, by 1945, he replaced Wilson as Chief Architect and Planning Officer. Edinburgh Architecture website He was stranded in Sweden for VE Day. However he spent the time designing kits for prefabricated houses which conformed to the recommendations of the 1944 UK government report Planning our New Homes. This led to the importation of over 2,000 Swedish post-war prefabricated houses. In 1946, Matthew moved to London, becoming Chief Architect and Planning Officer to the London County Council, where he served from 1946 to 1953, working on the post-war reconstruction of Greater London and masterminding the Festival of Britain including such buildings as the Royal Festival Hall, 1951. It was during these formative postwar years that the LCC‚Äôs housing and town planning policy established an international reputation, and many housing schemes (including the famous Roehampton housing estate) were created, as well as many schools.Document for Press conference for the reopening of the Royal Festival Hall, Southbank Centre, Tuesday 29 May 2007 In 1956, with Stirrat Johnson Marshall, Robert Matthew established the firm of RMJM (Robert Matthew, Johnson Marshall) in Edinburgh and London. Their first project was New Zealand House in the Haymarket, London (now considered one of Matthew's key buildings). In 1953 he returned to Edinburgh to become the first Professor of Architecture at the University of Edinburgh, where he established the new Department of Architecture in collaboration with RMJM, in a manner that has been compared to that of Walter Gropius at the Bauhaus. He continued as Professor there until 1968. The Matthew Architecture Gallery is now housed in the Department in his honour. Matthew was closely involved with Basil Spence and Alan Reiach in the University's development plan for George Square, which ultimately resulted in the demolition of three sides of the square, and their replacement with modernist buildings. Matthew/RMJM were directly responsible for the design of the Arts Faculty buildings, now called 40 George Square (formerly David Hume Tower), the Adam Ferguson building and the William Robertson Building. In the early 1960s, Matthew was involved in the replacement of overcrowded, insanitary tenement housing in Hutchesontown, Glasgow with high rise tower blocks. He worked alongside Basil Spence in the planning and design of the controversial Area C blocks in the Gorbals. Independently of Spence, his practice designed the adjacent Area B or \\"Riverside\\" high rise estate which unlike the ill-fated Area C blocks, have survived and are widely regarded as the more successful of the Gorbals high-rises. The Royal Commonwealth Pool In Edinburgh he was also behind the Royal Commonwealth Pool, British Home Stores on Princes Street, Edinburgh Airport, Lothian Regional Council Building and Wester Hailes Education Centre. Elsewhere, Matthew/RMJM were both involved in the design for the campuses of the University of Stirling and University of York, and with Pakistan's new capital buildings in Islamabad.  Honours  During his studies, Robert Matthew won the Pugin Student award (1929) and was Soane medallist (1932). He became a Fellow of the RIBA in 1955 and served as its President from 1962 to 1964. He was awarded an OBE in 1952 and knighted in 1962. He was later also President of the Commonwealth Association of Architects [CAA] and the International Union of Architects [UIA].  Other arts  Apart from his work as an architect, Matthew produced drawings that were widely exhibited, and also paintings, although they are less well known. Both display the same aesthetic concerns as Le Corbusier, Pablo Picasso and Henry Moore all of whom he was able to count among his friends and colleagues.

Background Cleary was born in Cornwall, Ontario, and was educated at St. Lawrence College. Elected as a councillor in Cornwall Township in 1972, he became the township's deputy reeve in 1974 and its reeve in 1976, serving in the latter capacity until 1987. He was chosen as warden for his region in 1983, and also served on the regional conservation authority from 1974 to 1987. Cleary died on October 7, 2012 in Cornwall and survived by his wife Elizabeth. Politics Cleary was elected to the Ontario legislature in the 1987 provincial election, defeating Progressive Conservative incumbent Luc Guindon in the Cornwall riding by about 1,000 votes. The Liberals won a majority government in this region, and Cleary served as a government backbencher for the next three years. The Liberals were defeated by the Ontario New Democratic Party in the 1990 election, although Cleary managed to retain his own riding by an increased margin. In opposition, he served as his party's Agriculture Critic for the next five years. The Progressive Conservatives won a majority government in the 1995 election, though Cleary managed to increase his majority again in Cornwall. He continued serving as his party's agriculture critic until 1996, when he was shifted to rural affairs. Cleary faced the most difficult re-election battle of his career in the provincial election of 1999, in which redistribution forced him to face longstanding Progressive Conservative MP Noble Villeneuve in the riding of Stormont‚ÄîDundas‚ÄîCharlottenburgh. Cleary eventually won the contest by 630 votes; most of the urban vote favoured him, while most of the rural vote favoured Villeneuve. He continued serving as his party's rural affairs critic until 2003, when he retired from the legislature. He also supported calls for a public inquiry into reports of an organized pedophile ring in the Cornwall area. Although not a skilled public speaker or a leading figure in the Liberal Party, Cleary was generally regarded as a good community representative during his time in the legislature. He was not considered to be an especially partisan figure, and in fact criticized party leader Dalton McGuinty for his personal attacks on Mike Harris in 1999. Cleary also held socially conservative views on some issues, including abortion.

The first modern horn antenna in 1938 with inventor Wilmer L. Barrow. A horn antenna or microwave horn is an antenna that consists of a flaring metal waveguide shaped like a horn to direct radio waves in a beam. Horns are widely used as antennas at UHF and microwave frequencies, above 300 MHz. They are used as feed antennas (called feed horns) for larger antenna structures such as parabolic antennas, as standard calibration antennas to measure the gain of other antennas, and as directive antennas for such devices as radar guns, automatic door openers, and microwave radiometers. Their advantages are moderate directivity, low standing wave ratio (SWR), broad bandwidth, and simple construction and adjustment. One of the first horn antennas was constructed in 1897 by Bengali-Indian radio researcher Jagadish Chandra Bose in his pioneering experiments with microwaves. reprinted in Igor Grigorov, Ed., Antentop, Vol.2, No.3, p.87-96, Belgorod, Russia The modern horn antenna was invented independently in 1938 by Wilmer Barrow and G. C. Southworth Barrow, Wilmer L, US patent 2467578 Electromagnetic horn, filed: December 10, 1946, granted: April 19, 1949 The development of radar in World War 2 stimulated horn research to design feed horns for radar antennas. The corrugated horn invented by Kay in 1962 has become widely used as a feed horn for microwave antennas such as satellite dishes and radio telescopes. An advantage of horn antennas is that since they have no resonant elements, they can operate over a wide range of frequencies, a wide bandwidth. The usable bandwidth of horn antennas is typically of the order of 10:1, and can be up to 20:1 (for example allowing it to operate from 1 GHz to 20 GHz). The input impedance is slowly varying over this wide frequency range, allowing low voltage standing wave ratio (VSWR) over the bandwidth. The gain of horn antennas ranges up to 25 dBi, with 10 - 20 dBi being typical.  Description  Pyramidal horn antennas for a variety of frequencies. They have flanges at the top to attach to standard waveguides. A horn antenna is used to transmit radio waves from a waveguide (a metal pipe used to carry radio waves) out into space, or collect radio waves into a waveguide for reception. It typically consists of a short length of rectangular or cylindrical metal tube (the waveguide), closed at one end, flaring into an open-ended conical or pyramidal shaped horn on the other end. The radio waves are usually introduced into the waveguide by a coaxial cable attached to the side, with the central conductor projecting into the waveguide to form a quarter-wave monopole antenna. The waves then radiate out the horn end in a narrow beam. In some equipment the radio waves are conducted between the transmitter or receiver and the antenna by a waveguide; in this case the horn is attached to the end of the waveguide. In outdoor horns, such as the feed horns of satellite dishes, the open mouth of the horn is often covered by a plastic sheet transparent to radio waves, to exclude moisture.  How it works  Corrugated conical horn antenna used as a feed horn on a Hughes Direcway home satellite dish. A transparent plastic sheet covers the horn mouth to keep out rain. A horn antenna serves the same function for electromagnetic waves that an acoustical horn does for sound waves in a musical instrument such as a trumpet. It provides a gradual transition structure to match the impedance of a tube to the impedance of free space, enabling the waves from the tube to radiate efficiently into space. If a simple open-ended waveguide is used as an antenna, without the horn, the sudden end of the conductive walls causes an abrupt impedance change at the aperture, from the wave impedance in the waveguide to the impedance of free space, (about 377 ohms). When radio waves travelling through the waveguide hit the opening, this impedance-step reflects a significant fraction of the wave energy back down the guide toward the source, so that not all of the power is radiated. This is similar to the reflection at an open-ended transmission line or a boundary between optical mediums with a low and high index of refraction, like at a glass surface. The reflected waves cause standing waves in the waveguide, increasing the SWR, wasting energy and possibly overheating the transmitter. In addition, the small aperture of the waveguide (less than one wavelength) causes significant diffraction of the waves issuing from it, resulting in a wide radiation pattern without much directivity. To improve these poor characteristics, the ends of the waveguide are flared out to form a horn. The taper of the horn changes the impedance gradually along the horn's length. This acts like an impedance matching transformer, allowing most of the wave energy to radiate out the end of the horn into space, with minimal reflection. The taper functions similarly to a tapered transmission line, or an optical medium with a smoothly varying refractive index. In addition, the wide aperture of the horn projects the waves in a narrow beam. The horn shape that gives minimum reflected power is an exponential taper. Exponential horns are used in special applications that require minimum signal loss, such as satellite antennas and radio telescopes. However conical and pyramidal horns are most widely used, because they have straight sides and are easier to design and fabricate.  Radiation pattern  The waves travel down a horn as spherical wavefronts, with their origin at the apex of the horn, a point called the phase center. The pattern of electric and magnetic fields at the aperture plane at the mouth of the horn, which determines the radiation pattern, is a scaled-up reproduction of the fields in the waveguide. Because the wavefronts are spherical, the phase increases smoothly from the edges of the aperture plane to the center, because of the difference in length of the center point and the edge points from the apex point. The difference in phase between the center point and the edges is called the phase error. This phase error, which increases with the flare angle, reduces the gain and increases the beamwidth, giving horns wider beamwidths than similar-sized plane-wave antennas such as parabolic dishes. At the flare angle, the radiation of the beam lobe is down about 20 dB from its maximum value. As the size of a horn (expressed in wavelengths) is increased, the phase error increases, giving the horn a wider radiation pattern. Keeping the beamwidth narrow requires a longer horn (smaller flare angle) to keep the phase error constant. The increasing phase error limits the aperture size of practical horns to about 15 wavelengths; larger apertures would require impractically long horns. This limits the gain of practical horns to about 1000 (30 dBi) and the corresponding minimum beamwidth to about 5 - 10¬∞. Types Horn antenna types Stack of sectoral feed horns for air search radar antenna Below are the main types of horn antennas. Horns can have different flare angles as well as different expansion curves (elliptic, hyperbolic, etc.) in the E-field and H-field directions, making possible a wide variety of different beam profiles. :Pyramidal horn (a, right) ‚Äì a horn antenna with the horn in the shape of a four-sided pyramid, with a rectangular cross section. They are a common type, used with rectangular waveguides, and radiate linearly polarized radio waves. :Sectoral horn ‚Äì A pyramidal horn with only one pair of sides flared and the other pair parallel. It produces a fan-shaped beam, which is narrow in the plane of the flared sides, but wide in the plane of the narrow sides. These types are often used as feed horns for wide search radar antennas. ::E-plane horn (b) ‚Äì A sectoral horn flared in the direction of the electric or E-field in the waveguide. ::H-plane horn (c) ‚Äì A sectoral horn flared in the direction of the magnetic or H-field in the waveguide. :Conical horn (d) ‚Äì A horn in the shape of a cone, with a circular cross section. They are used with cylindrical waveguides. :Exponential horn (e) ‚Äì A horn with curved sides, in which the separation of the sides increases as an exponential function of length. Also called a scalar horn, they can have pyramidal or conical cross sections. Exponential horns have minimum internal reflections, and almost constant impedance and other characteristics over a wide frequency range. They are used in applications requiring high performance, such as feed horns for communication satellite antennas and radio telescopes. :Corrugated horn ‚Äì A horn with parallel slots or grooves, small compared with a wavelength, covering the inside surface of the horn, transverse to the axis. Corrugated horns have wider bandwidth and smaller sidelobes and cross-polarization, and are widely used as feed horns for satellite dishes and radio telescopes. :Dual-mode conical horn ‚Äì (The Potter horn ) This horn can be used to replace the corrugated horn for use at sub-mm wavelengths where the corrugated horn is lossy and difficult to fabricate. :Diagonal horn ‚Äì This simple dual-mode horn superficially looks like a pyramidal horn with a square output aperture. On closer inspection, however, the square output aperture is seen to be rotated 45¬∞ relative to the waveguide. These horns are typically machined into split blocks and used at sub-mm wavelengths. :Ridged horn ‚Äì A pyramidal horn with ridges or fins attached to the inside of the horn, extending down the center of the sides. The fins lower the cutoff frequency, increasing the antenna's bandwidth. :Septum horn ‚Äì A horn which is divided into several subhorns by metal partitions (septums) inside, attached to opposite walls. :Aperture- limited horn ‚Äì a long narrow horn, long enough so the phase error is a negligible fraction of a wavelength, so it essentially radiates a plane wave. It has an aperture efficiency of 1.0 so it gives the maximum gain and minimum beamwidth for a given aperture size. The gain is not affected by the length but only limited by diffraction at the aperture. Used as feed horns in radio telescopes and other high-resolution antennas.  Optimum horn  Corrugated horn antenna with a bandwidth of 3.7 to 6 GHz designed to attach to SMA waveguide feedline. This was used as a feedhorn for a parabolic antenna on a British military base. Cassegrain spacecraft communication antenna at NASA's Goldstone Deep Space Communications Complex. For a given frequency and horn length, there is some flare angle that gives minimum reflection and maximum gain. The internal reflections in straight-sided horns come from the two locations along the wave path where the impedance changes abruptly; the mouth or aperture of the horn, and the throat where the sides begin to flare out. The amount of reflection at these two sites varies with the flare angle of the horn (the angle the sides make with the axis). In narrow horns with small flare angles most of the reflection occurs at the mouth of the horn. The gain of the antenna is low because the small mouth approximates an open-ended waveguide. As the angle is increased, the reflection at the mouth decreases rapidly and the antenna's gain increases. In contrast, in wide horns with flare angles approaching 90¬∞ most of the reflection is at the throat. The horn's gain is again low because the throat approximates an open-ended waveguide. As the angle is decreased, the amount of reflection at this site drops, and the horn's gain again increases. This discussion shows that there is some flare angle between 0¬∞ and 90¬∞ which gives maximum gain and minimum reflection. This is called the optimum horn. Most practical horn antennas are designed as optimum horns. In a pyramidal horn, the dimensions that give an optimum horn are: Narayan 2007, p. 168 :a_E = \\\\sqrt{2 \\\\lambda L_E} \\\\qquad a_H = \\\\sqrt{3 \\\\lambda L_H} For a conical horn, the dimensions that give an optimum horn are: :d = \\\\sqrt{3 \\\\lambda L} where :aE is the width of the aperture in the E-field direction :aH is the width of the aperture in the H-field direction :LE is the slant length of the side in the E-field direction :LH is the slant length of the side in the H-field direction. :d is the diameter of the cylindrical horn aperture :L is the slant length of the cone from the apex. :Œª is the wavelength An optimum horn does not yield maximum gain for a given aperture size. That is achieved with a very long horn (an aperture limited horn). The optimum horn yields maximum gain for a given horn length. Tables showing dimensions for optimum horns for various frequencies are given in microwave handbooks. Large pyramidal horn used in 1951 to detect the 21 cm (1.43 GHz) radiation from hydrogen gas in the Milky Way galaxy. Currently on display at the Green Bank Observatory in Green Bank, West Virginia, U.S.  Gain  Horns have very little loss, so the directivity of a horn is roughly equal to its gain. The gain G of a pyramidal horn antenna (the ratio of the radiated power intensity along its beam axis to the intensity of an isotropic antenna with the same input power) is: :G = \\\\frac{4 \\\\pi A}{\\\\lambda^2} e_A For conical horns, the gain is: :G = \\\\left ( \\\\frac{\\\\pi d}{\\\\lambda} \\\\right )^2 e_A where :A is the area of the aperture, :d is the aperture diameter of a conical horn :Œª is the wavelength, :eA is a dimensionless parameter between 0 and 1 called the aperture efficiency, The aperture efficiency ranges from 0.4 to 0.8 in practical horn antennas. For optimum pyramidal horns, eA = 0.511., while for optimum conical horns eA = 0.522. So an approximate figure of 0.5 is often used. The aperture efficiency increases with the length of the horn, and for aperture-limited horns is approximately unity. Horn-reflector antenna A type of antenna that combines a horn with a parabolic reflector is known as a Hogg-horn, or horn-reflector antenna, invented by Alfred C. Beck and Harald T. Friis in 1941 U. S. patent no. 2416675 Horn antenna system, filed November 26, 1941, Alfred C. Beck, Harold T. Friis on Google Patents and further developed by David C. Hogg at Bell labs in 1961. on Alcatel-Lucent website It is also referred to as the \\"sugar scoop\\" due to its characteristic shape. It consists of a horn antenna with a reflector mounted in the mouth of the horn at a 45 degree angle so the radiated beam is at right angles to the horn axis. The reflector is a segment of a parabolic reflector, and the focus of the reflector is at the apex of the horn, so the device is equivalent to a parabolic antenna fed off-axis.Meeks, 1976, p.13 The advantage of this design over a standard parabolic antenna is that the horn shields the antenna from radiation coming from angles outside the main beam axis, so its radiation pattern has very small sidelobes. Also, the aperture isn't partially obstructed by the feed and its supports, as with ordinary front-fed parabolic dishes, allowing it to achieve aperture efficiencies of 70% as opposed to 55-60% for front-fed dishes. The disadvantage is that it is far larger and heavier for a given aperture area than a parabolic dish, and must be mounted on a cumbersome turntable to be fully steerable. This design was used for a few radio telescopes and communication satellite ground antennas during the 1960s. Its largest use, however, was as fixed antennas for microwave relay links in the AT&T; Long Lines microwave network. on Albert LaFrance [long- lines.net] website Since the 1970s this design has been superseded by shrouded parabolic dish antennas, which can achieve equally good sidelobe performance with a lighter more compact construction. Probably the most photographed and well-known example is the 15 meter (50 foot) long Holmdel Horn Antenna at Bell Labs in Holmdel, New Jersey, with which Arno Penzias and Robert Wilson discovered cosmic microwave background radiation in 1965, for which they won the 1978 Nobel Prize in Physics. Another more recent horn-reflector design is the cass-horn, which is a combination of a horn with a cassegrain parabolic antenna using two reflectors.

Horns are distinct from antlers, which are not permanent. In mammals, true horns are found mainly among the ruminant artiodactyls, in the families Antilocapridae (pronghorn) and Bovidae (cattle, goats, antelope etc.). Cattle horns arise from subcutaneous connective tissue (under the scalp) and later fuse to the underlying frontal bone. One pair of horns is usual; however, two or more pairs occur in a few wild species and in some domesticated breeds of sheep. Polycerate (multi-horned) sheep breeds include the Hebridean, Icelandic, Jacob, Manx Loaghtan, and the Navajo-Churro. Horns usually have a curved or spiral shape, often with ridges or fluting. In many species, only males have horns. Horns start to grow soon after birth and continue to grow throughout the life of the animal (except in pronghorns, which shed the outer layer annually, but retain the bony core). Partial or deformed horns in livestock are called scurs. Similar growths on other parts of the body are not usually called horns, but spurs, claws, or hooves, depending on the part of the body on which they occur. Other hornlike growths The term \\"horn\\" is also popularly applied to other hard and pointed features attached to the head of animals in various other families: * Giraffidae: Giraffes have one or more pairs of bony bumps on their heads, called ossicones. These are covered with furred skin. * Cervidae: Most deer have antlers, which are not true horns. When fully developed, antlers are dead bone without a horn or skin covering; they are borne only by adults (usually males, except for reindeer) and are shed and regrown each year. * Rhinocerotidae: The \\"horns\\" of rhinoceroses are made of keratin, the same substance as fingernails, and grow continuously, but do not have a bone core. * Chamaeleonidae: Many chameleons, most notably the Jackson's chameleon, possess horns on their skulls, and have a keratin covering. * Ceratopsidae: The \\"horns\\" of the Triceratops were extensions of its skull bones, although debate exists over whether they had a keratin covering. * Abelisauridae: Various abelisaurid theropods, such as Carnotaurus and Majungasaurus possessed extensions of the frontal bone which were likely covered in some form of keratinous integument. * Horned lizards (Phrynosoma): These lizards have horns on their heads which have a hard keratin covering over a bony core, like mammalian horns. * Insects: Some insects (such as rhinoceros beetles) have hornlike structures on the head or thorax (or both). These are pointed outgrowths of the hard chitinous exoskeleton. Some (such as stag beetles) have greatly enlarged jaws, also made of chitin. * Canidae: Golden jackals are known to occasionally develop a horny growth on the skull, which is associated with magical powers in south-eastern Asia.Sketches of the natural history of Ceylon by Sir James Emerson Tennent, published by Longman, Green, Longman, and Roberts, 1861Mammals of Nepal: (with reference to those of India, Bangladesh, Bhutan and Pakistan) by Tej Kumar Shrestha, published by Steven Simpson Books, 1997, * Azendohsauridae: the skull of the triassic azendohsaurid archosauromorph Shringasaurus possessed two massive, forward-facing conical horns, which were likely covered in cornified sheaths in life. * Anhimidae: The horned screamer possesses an entirely keratinous spine, which is loosely connected to its skull. Many mammal species in various families have tusks, which often serve the same functions as horns, but are in fact oversized teeth. These include the Moschidae (Musk deer, which are ruminants), Suidae (Wild Boars), Proboscidea (Elephants), Monodontidae (Narwhals) and Odobenidae (Walruses). Polled animals or pollards are those of normally-horned (mainly domesticated) species whose horns have been removed, or which have not grown. In some cases such animals have small horny growths in the skin where their horns would be ‚Äì these are known as scurs. =On humans= Cutaneous horns are the only examples of horns growing on people. Cases of people growing horns have been historically described, sometimes with mythical status. Researchers have not however discovered photographic evidence of the phenomenon. (Literature Reviews) There are human cadaveric specimens that show outgrowings, but these are instead classified as osteomas or other excrescences. The phenomenon of humans with horns has been observed in countries lacking advanced medicine. There are living people, several in China, with cases of cutaneous horns, most common in the elderly. Some people, notably The Enigma, have horn implants; that is, they have implanted silicone beneath the skin as a form of body modification. Animal uses of horns Goat skull piece African buffalo (both sexes have horns) Animals have a variety of uses for horns and antlers, including defending themselves from predators and fighting members of their own species (horn fighting) for territory, dominance or mating priority.) Horns are usually present only in males but in some species, females too may possess horns. It has been theorized by researchers that taller species living in the open are more visible from longer distances and more likely to benefit from horns to defend themselves against predators. Female bovids that are not hidden from predators due to their large size or open savannahlike habitat are more likely to bear horns than small or camouflaged species. In addition, horns may be used to root in the soil or strip bark from trees. In animal courtship many use horns in displays. For example, the male blue wildebeest reams the bark and branches of trees to impress the female and lure her into his territory. Some animals with true horns use them for cooling. The blood vessels in the bony core allow the horns to function as a radiator. After the death of a horned animal, the keratin may be consumed by the larvae of the horn moth. Human uses of horns Water buffalo horn used as a hammer with cleaver to cut fish in southeast China *Horned animals are sometimes hunted so their mounted head or horns can be displayed as a hunting trophy or as decorative objects. *Some cultures use bovid horns as musical instruments, for example, the shofar. These have evolved into brass instruments in which, unlike the trumpet, the bore gradually increases in width through most of its length‚Äîthat is to say, it is conical rather than cylindrical. These are called horns, though now made of metal. *Drinking horns are bovid horns removed from the bone core, cleaned, polished, and used as drinking vessels. (This is similar to the legend of the cornucopia.) It has been suggested that the shape of a natural horn was also the model for the rhyton, a horn-shaped drinking vessel.Chusid, Hearing Shofar: The Still Small Voice of the Ram's Horn, 2009, Chapter 3-6 - Ram's Horn of Passover . The book also posits that the ancient Hebrews and neighboring tribes used horns as weapons and as utensils. *Powder horns were originally bovid horns fitted with lids and carrying straps, used to carry gunpowder. Powder flasks of any material may be referred to as powder horns. *Shoehorns were originally made from slices of bovid horn, which provided the right curving shape and a smooth surface. *Antelope horns are used in traditional Chinese medicine. *Horns consist of keratin, and the term \\"horn\\" is used to refer to this material, sometimes including similarly solid keratin from other parts of animals, such as hoofs. Horn may be used as a material in tools, furniture and decoration, among other uses. In these applications, horn is valued for its hardness, and it has given rise to the expression hard as horn. Horn is somewhat thermoplastic and (like tortoiseshell) was formerly used for many purposes where plastic would now be used. Horn may be used to make glue. *Horn bows are bows made from a combination of horn, sinew and usually wood. These materials allow more energy to be stored in a short bow than wood alone. *Horns and horn tips from various animals have been used for centuries in the manufacture of scales, grips, or handles for knives and other weapons, and beginning in the 19th century, for the handle scales of handguns. *Horn buttons may be made from horns, and historically also hooves which are a similar material. The non-bony part of the horn or hoof may be softened by heating to a temperature just above the boiling point of water, then molded in metal dies, or the hollow lower part of the horn may be slit spirally lengthwise and then flattened in a vise between wood boards, again after heating, and later cut with a holesaw or similar tool into round or other shaped blanks which are finished on a lathe or by hand. Toggle buttons are made by cutting off the solid tips of horns and perforating them. Antler buttons, and buttons made from hooves are not technically horn buttons, but are often referred to as such in popular parlance. Horns from cattle, water buffalo, and sheep are all used for commercial button making, and of other species as well, on a local and non-commercial basis. *Horn combs were common in the era before replacement by plastic, and are still made. *Horn needle cases and other small boxes, particularly of water buffalo horn, are still made. One occasionally finds horn used as a material in antique snuff boxes. *Horn strips for inlaying wood are a traditional technique. *Carved horn hairpins and other jewelry such as brooches and rings are manufactured, particularly in Asia, including for the souvenir trade. *Horn is used in artwork for small, detailed carvings. It is an easily worked and polished material, is strong and durable, and in the right variety, beautiful. *Horn chopsticks are found in Asian countries from highland Nepal and Tibet to the Pacific coast. Typically they are not the common material, but rather are higher quality decorative articles. Similarly other horn flatware, notably spoons, continues to be manufactured for decorations and other purposes. *Long dice made of horn that have a rodlike elongated shape with four numbered faces and two small unnumbered end faces continue to be manufactured in Asia where they are traditionally used in games like Chaupar (Pachisi) and many others. *Horn is sometimes a material found in walking sticks, cane handles and shafts. In the latter use, the horn elements may be cut into short cylindrical segments held together by a metal core.

He assembled the Arnamagn√¶an Manuscript Collection. Life √Årni was born in 1663 at Kvennabrekka in Dalas√Ωsla, in western Iceland, where his father Magn√∫s J√≥nsson was the minister (and later prosecutor and sheriff). His mother was Gu√∞r√∫n Ketilsd√≥ttir, daughter of archdeacon Ketill J√∂rundarson of Hvammur.Sigurgeir Steingr√≠msson, tr. Bernhard Scudder, √Årni Magn√∫sson (1663‚Äì1730) - live and work, The √Årni Magn√∫sson Institute for Icelandic Studies. He was raised by his grandparents and uncle. At 17 he entered the Cathedral School in Sk√°lholt, then three years later, in 1683, went to Denmark (with his father, who was part of a trade lobbying contingent) to study at the University of Copenhagen. There he earned the degree of attestus theologi√¶ after two years, and also became an assistant to the Royal Antiquarian, Thomas Bartholin, helping him prepare his Antiquitates danic√¶ and transcribing, translating, and annotating thousands of pages of Icelandic material.Eir√≠kur Benedikz, \\"√Årni Magn√∫sson,\\" Saga-Book 16 (1962-65) 89-93, p. 89. After Bartholin's death in 1690, √Årni became librarian and secretary to a Danish statesman, Matthias Moth, brother of the king's mistress, Sophie Amalie Moth. From late 1694 to late 1696, he was in Germany, primarily to assess a book collection that had been offered to the university, but he extended the stay. Meanwhile, presumably thanks to his employer, he was appointed a professor designate at the university, and since he had never published, while still in Leipzig he published an edition of some Danish chronicles that he had copied while working for Bartholin.Eir√≠kur, pp. 90-91. When he returned to Denmark, he resumed working for Moth but in 1697 was also appointed secretary at The Royal Secret Archives (Det Kongelige Gehejmearkiv). In 1699 he published anonymously, at Moth's request, an account of a witchcraft case in which Moth had been a judge, Kort og sandf√¶rdig Beretning om den vidtudraabte Bes√¶ttelse udi Thisted.Eir√≠kur, p. 91. With vice-lawman P√°ll V√≠dal√≠n, he was assigned by the king to survey conditions in Iceland; this took ten years, from 1702 to 1712, most of which time he spent there. He returned to Copenhagen for two winters, the first time to present trade proposals, and during the second, which was in connection with a court case, he got married. The ultimate results of the survey were the Icelandic census of 1703 and the Jar√∞ab√≥k or land register, surveying for which was not completed until 1714 and which had to be translated into Danish after √Årni's death. He was expected to translate it himself, but it was one of several official tasks he neglected. It was finally published in 11 volumes in 1911‚Äì41. However, the mission as set out by the king was extremely broad, including investigating the feasibility of sulphur mining, assessing the fisheries, and auditing the administration of justice. Complaints of judicial abuse poured in, and officials were incensed by the two men's inquiries into past court cases and in turn complained to Copenhagen about them. Returning in 1713 to Copenhagen, where he was to spend the rest of his life, √Årni resumed his duties as librarian, becoming unofficial head of the archive early in 1720 and later deputy librarian, possibly eventually head librarian, at the University Library. He also took up his appointment as professor of Philosophy and Danish Antiquities at the university, which had been awarded in 1701. In 1721 he was also appointed Professor of History and Geography.√Årni Magn√∫sson's entry in the Dansk Biografisk Lexikon, by Kristian Kaalund, Volume 11, pp. 52-7.According to Sigurgeir, in addition to his librarianship duties, he spent most of his time tutoring students for money and may never have lectured. √Årni had a lifelong passion for collecting manuscripts, principally Icelandic, but also those of other Nordic countries. It is likely that this started with Bartholin, who, when he had to return to Iceland temporarily in 1685 because his father had died, ordered him to bring back every manuscript he could lay hands on, and then sent him to Norway and Lund in 1689‚Äì90 to collect more.Eir√≠kur, p. 90. In addition, his uncle had been a scribe and his grandfather Ketill J√∂rundsson was a very prolific copyist. When he started collecting, most of the large codices had already been removed from Iceland and were in either the royal collection in Copenhagen or private collections in various Scandinavian countries; only in 1685, at Bartholin's urging, did the king forbid selling Icelandic manuscripts to foreigners and exporting them. But there was plenty left, especially since √Årni was interested in even humble items and would do whatever it took to get something. When Bartholin died, √Årni helped his brother prepare his books and manuscripts for sale, and secured the Icelandic manuscripts among them for himself, including M√∂√∞ruvallab√≥k. Through his connection with Moth, √Årni had some political influence, for which aspiring Icelanders gave him books and manuscripts. During his ten years surveying Iceland, he had access by the king's writ to all manuscripts in the country, had his collection with him, and worked on it during the winters; it and the survey papers had to be left behind in Iceland when he was recalled, but were shipped to him in 1721. What he could not secure, he would borrow for copying; a number of copyists worked for him at his professorial residence in Copenhagen. His collection became the largest of its kind. Unfortunately, his house burned down in the Copenhagen fire of 1728; with the help of friends, he was able to save most of the manuscripts, but some things were lost, including almost all the printed books and at least one unique item.Eir√≠kur, p. 92. His copyist J√≥n √ìlafsson wrote out the contents of one manuscript from memory after both it and the copy he had made were lost in the fire.Gunnar Karlsson, The History of Iceland, Minneapolis: University of Minnesota, 2000, , p. 159. √Årni has been blamed for delaying too long before starting to move his collection.Gunnar, pp. 159‚Äì60. He had not made an exhaustive inventory of his holdings, and several times stated that he believed the losses greater than was generally thought. (Everything in the University Library was destroyed, including many Icelandic documents which we now have only because of copies √Årni made for Bartholin, and most other professors lost all their books.) √Årni was consulted by and readily assisted scholars all over Europe. In particular, he considerably helped √ûorm√≥√∞ur Torfason, the Royal Historian of Norway, in preparing his work for publication,Eir√≠kur, pp. 92-93. having first made his acquaintance when he travelled there for Bartholin, and the second edition of √çslendingab√≥k ever published (in Oxford) is actually substantially √Årni's translation and commentary, although Christen Worm is credited as editor. √Årni disavowed it as a youthful effort.Eir√≠kur, p. 93. √Årni was unusual for his time in scrupulous crediting of sources and attention to accuracy. In his own aphorism: > Svo gengur √æa√∞ til √≠ heiminum, a√∞ sumir hj√°lpa erroribus √° g√°ng og a√∞rir > leitast s√≠√∞an vi√∞ a√∞ √∫try√∞ja aftur √æeim s√∂mu erroribus. Hafa svo hverir > tveggja nokku√∞ a√∞ i√∞ja. :\\"And that is the way of the world, that some men put errors into circulation and others afterwards try to eradicate those same errors. And so both sorts of men have something to do\\".Eir√≠kur, p. 92; his translation. √Årni made a late marriage in 1709 to Mette Jensdatter Fischer, widow of the royal saddlemaker, who was 19 years older and wealthy.Sigurgeir; according to Eir√≠kur, p. 92, only 10 years. He returned to Iceland only a few months later to continue his work on the land register; they corresponded by letter until his return to Copenhagen. He lived only a little more than a year after the Copenhagen fire, dependent on friends for lodgings and having to move three times; the winter was harsh and when he fell ill, he had to have assistance to sign his will. He died early the next day, January 7, 1730, and was buried in the north choir of the still-ruined Vor Frue Kirke. His wife died in September and was buried beside him. He bequeathed his collection to the state with provision for its upkeep and for assistance to Icelandic students. It forms the basis of the Arnamagn√¶an Institute and associated stipends. Legacy √Årni's remaining collection, now known as the Arnamagn√¶an Manuscript Collection, is now divided between two institutions, both named after him and both educational as well as archival in purpose: the Arnamagn√¶an Institute in Copenhagen and the √Årni Magn√∫sson Institute for Icelandic Studies in Reykjav√≠k. The street Arni Magnussons Gade in the Kalvebod Brygge area of Copenhagen is named after him. He was depicted on the now-obsolete 100 Icelandic kr√≥na banknote. The character Arnas Arn√¶us in Nobel prize-winner Halld√≥r Kiljan Laxness's novel Iceland's Bell (√çslandsklukkan) is based on him; the novel concerns the manslaughter case against J√≥n Hreggvi√∞sson, a farmer whose conviction was eventually reversed in part due to √Årni and V√≠dal√≠n's investigations. Also Arne Saknussemm, a character in Jules Verne's Journey to the Center of the Earth, is based on him.Heather Wilkinson, ed., Jules Verne, Journey to the Center of the Earth, New York: Pocket, 2008, , p. 293.Daniel Comp√®re, Jules Verne: √©crivain, Histoire des id√©es et critique litt√©raire 294, Geneva: Droz, 1991, p. 130 References Sources * Hans Bekker-Nielsen and Ole Widding.

Joe Bob was Bloom's satirical creation, allowing him to spoof stereotypical \\"redneck\\" Texan values while giving genuine praise to schlock films. It was not widely known until he was fired in 1985 that Briggs was not, in fact, a real person. Joe Bob exclusively viewed movies in drive-ins, in his Oldsmobile Toronado with any one of several girlfriends. According to his column, he has four ex-wives, and is always on the lookout for \\"ex-wife number five\\". An entire fictional cast of characters popped up over the period of the column, who would often be mentioned in the story along with the movie reviews. The entire book is made up of columns and shorter segments called \\"Joe Bob's Mailbag,\\" when Joe Bob writes back to his fans, and often his critics. The only two people who actually appear in the first person are Joe Bob and Stephen King, who saw several of his books made into movies during that period and actually wrote the introduction to the book when it was compiled and published in 1987. Joe Bob/Bloom lived in Texas during the duration of both this book and its sequel, Joe Bob Goes Back to the Drive In.

Alternate renditions of his name include , , and . His first name is sometimes given in English as Nicholas. Miko≈Çaj was able to gain much political influence thanks to the romance between his cousin Barbara Radziwi≈Ç≈Ç and King of Poland and Grand Duke of Lithuania Zygmunt II August.Peter Paul Bajer Short history of the Radziwill Family This made him one of the most powerful royal advisers. Mikolaj became Marshal of Lithuania, Grand Chancellor of Lithuania, as well as Palatine of Vilnius, gained immense wealth and became the most powerful magnate in the Commonwealth of that time. The growing influence of the Radziwi≈Ç≈Ç family was further bolstered when, during a diplomatic mission to Charles V and Ferdinand I, he and his cousin Miko≈Çaj the Red received a hereditary title of Prince (Reichsf√ºrst (SRI)). He formed an alliance with his cousin Miko≈Çaj \\"the Red\\" Radziwi≈Ç≈Ç against other notable Lithuanian families in the rivalry for the dominant status in the Great Duchy of Lithuania. This alliance marked the formation of a dynastic- like cooperation between Radziwi≈Ç≈Çs and showed how family interests could affect magnates' relations with the state. Both Radziwi≈Ç≈Çs backed the cause of Lithuania's sovereignty and opposed the growing Polish-Lithuanian union. Reburial of Miko≈Çaj the Black in the Dubingiai, Lithuania Coincidentally, despite opposing close ties with Poland, he was the chief negotiator in the successful negotiation between Grand Duchy of Lithuania and the state controlled by the Livonian Order, which led to the secularisation of Livonia and its union with Grand Duchy of Lithuania in 1562. Miko≈Çaj contributed to the ongoing Polonisation of the Grand Duchy, influencing other Lithuanian nobles to follow him in adopting Polish cultureits fashion, customs and language. He was known for his religious beliefs, as he was one of the most prominent converts and advocates of the Reformed churches faith in Grand Duchy of Lithuania. He provided financial support for the printing of the first complete Polish translation of the Bible in 1563 in Brest-Litovsk, distributed works written in defense of the Reformed faith, financed a church and college in Vilnius, supported educated Protestants, and in various other ways fostered the Calvinist faith. He is known to have exchanged letters with John Calvin and protected religious exiles from Italy. Because Protestants supported usage of local languages, he is also believed to have funded Lithuanian churches and schools. With the exception of his daughter Anna, all his children converted to Roman Catholicism and became ardent supporters of the Counter Reformation. He is remembered by a statue in the Brest Millennium Monument.

Son of Mastanesosus, who was dead in 49 BC.  Biography  He was surely the son of Mastanesosus, king of Mauretania. His father was identified from the Latin legends of the coins that give the exact lineage Rex Bocchus Sosi f or Sos fi and cannot be read other than \\"King Bocchus son of Sosus\\". By the De Bello Africo it is known that in 49 BC, the kingdom of Sosus, which had also been that of the earlier Bocchus I, had been divided between Bocchus II and Bogud, who were brothers. Bocchus II ruled over the eastern part of Mauretania and had Iol as capital and his brother Bogud ruled over the western part of Mauretania and had Volubilis as capital. The only known things about his rule were three events: his relations with Sittius, his part in the war against Juba I and the Pompeians, and the annexation of Western Mauretania. He was recognized as king by the Caesarean Senate in 49 BC, but he was previously hostile to Juba and it is unknown when exactly his reign began. It is certain that by this time, him and his brother Bogud, would plead in favor of Caesar against the Pompeians and their ally Juba I, king of Numidia. = Conquest of Numidia = During the Roman civil war of 49‚Äì45 BC, Bocchus and Sittius invaded Numidia, overthrowing Massinissa II, whose kingdom was easily conquered, and seized Cirta within a few days, the capital of the kingdom of Juba I, who was thus obliged to abandon the idea of joining Metellus Scipio against Caesar. Bocchus' actions stopped there, but Sittius continued the fight, beating Saburra, the lieutenant of Juba, capturing Faustus, Sylla, and Afranius, leading his fleet to Hippo Regius, where he caught Metellus Scipio's ship rushing. At the end of the war, Caesar bestowed upon Bocchus part of the territory of Masinissa II, Juba's ally, which was recovered by Massinissa's son Arabio after Caesar's murder. This cites: *Bell. Afric, 25 *Dio Cassius xli. 42, xliii. 36, xlviii. 45 *Appian, Bell Civ. ii. 96, iv. 54. The kingdom of Mauretania thus extended to Ampsaga. The rest of the kingdom of Massinissa II, the region near the sea north of Cirta and the territory of Cirta, which had belonged to Juba, were given to Sittius. = Annexation of Western Mauretania and death = Dio Cassius says that Bocchus sent his sons to support Sextus Pompeius in Spain, while Bogud fought on the side of Caesar, and there is no doubt that after Caesar's death Bocchus supported Octavian, and Bogud Antony. During Bogud's absence in Spain, Bocchus II seized the whole of Mauretania, and was confirmed sole ruler by Octavian. Thus Bocchus II reconstituted a unification of a larger Mauretanian kingdom than Bocchus I and Sosus had ever known. He died without heir, donating his kingdom to Augustus, who, after a period of direct administration, gave it to Juba II the son of Juba I. After his death in 33 BC, Numidia was made a Roman client state, then Roman province in 44 AD.

He played in Major League Baseball (MLB) for the Chicago Cubs, Brooklyn Dodgers, Boston Braves, New York Giants, and St. Louis Cardinals between 1943 and 1953. He was born in Philadelphia, Pennsylvania.\\"Eddie Stanky Statistics and History\\". \\"baseball-reference.com. Retrieved on 2017-05-14. It took Stanky eight years to reach the major leagues at age 27, after starting out at Greenville, Mississippi, in the East Dixie League, where he was a teammate of future St. Louis Cardinals star Harry Brecheen, whom Stanky would manage in St. Louis in 1952. \\"All he can do is win\\" Stanky was famous for his ability to draw walks; he drew 100 or more walks in each of six different seasons, 140 or more in two of them. In 1946, he hit just .273 but his 137 walks allowed him to lead the league in OBP with .436, edging out Stan Musial--who led in more than ten hitting categories. His best season was probably 1950 with the Giants, when he hit an even .300 and led the league in walks (144) and OBP (.460). On August 30, he tied a major league record when he walked in seven consecutive at-bats (in two games). Leo Durocher, who managed him with the Dodgers and Giants, once summed up Stanky's talents: he said the second baseman \\"can't hit, can't run, can't field [but] he just knows how to win.\\" Yankee shortstop Phil Rizzuto still complained years later about a notorious play during Game 3 of the 1951 World Series in which Stanky kicked the ball loose from Rizzuto's glove as he slid into second base, instrumental in the Giant win that put them ahead two games to one, although they lost the next three and the Series with it. Stanky himself said, \\"I would spike my mother if it meant being safe on a close play.\\" As a runner at third base with less than two out, he would station himself several feet back of the bag, in shallow left field. He would time the arc of any outfield fly and then take off running, step on third as the catch was being made and continue to run at full speed, making it almost impossible to throw him out at home, a tactic eventually outlawed as a result. He was also (in)famous for what came to be called \\"the Stanky maneuver\\", distracting opposing hitters by jumping up and down and waving his arms behind the pitcher from his second base position. Stanky was also a master of the \\"delayed steal\\" in which the runner feigns disinterest after the pitch; but instead of walking back to first breaks for second as soon as the infielders return to their normal positions. As Cardinal player-manager, he would hold up games close to being called on account of darkness or curfew when that would benefit his team, by walking leisurely to the mound from second base or the dugout (when not playing) after every pitch to confer with his pitcher, eventually resulting in the one-trip-per-inning rule. Contribution to breaking the color barrier Stanky contributed to the breaking of the color barrier as a member of the Brooklyn Dodgers in 1947. Upon first meeting Jackie Robinson at spring training, Stanky told him he was not in favor of integrating baseball, and that he was unhappy that it was his own team doing it, but that despite his own personal feelings, Robinson was now his teammate, and Stanky promised he would have his back. When Robinson began playing that season, he was treated harshly and discriminated against, and frequently taunted with insults and threats by players from the opposing teams. Stanky stayed silent at first, but finally yelled back at Ben Chapman's racist insults during a game. Not long afterward, the other Dodgers began to stand up for Robinson as well. The incident is portrayed in the film 42. Stanky is played by Jesse Luken. Robinson, a natural second baseman, was shifted to first base in his rookie season as Stanky was already the Dodgers' second baseman and leadoff hitter. Robinson credited Stanky with giving him tips that made the transition to first base easier. Before the 1948 season began, Stanky was traded to the Boston Braves so that Robinson could return to his natural position and also bat leadoff. Manager of Cardinals and White Sox He appeared in three World Series in the five years between 1947 and 1951 ‚Äî with three different National League champions, the Dodgers, Braves and Giants, all of whom lost to their American League opponents. Following the 1951 World Series, in which he played in all six games for the Giants but hit an anemic .136, he was traded to the Cardinals as player-manager. In 1952, his Cardinals won seven more games than they had in 1951 and he was chosen Major League Manager of the Year by The Sporting News. The Cards advanced from fourth to third place in the National League standings, although finishing 15 games behind the pennant-winning Dodgers. But his time as Cardinal manager coincided with the slow decline of the team and its farm system from its glory days in the 1940s and the ownership transition from Fred Saigh to August \\"Gussie\\" Busch. On May 27, 1955, after a 17‚Äì19 start, he was fired. Stanky then managed the Triple-A Minneapolis Millers (1956) before returning to the Majors as a coach for the Cleveland Indians (1957‚Äì58). He then spent almost six seasons in the Cardinal front office in charge of player development (1959‚Äì64), moving on to the New York Mets in a similar capacity in 1965. In , he succeeded Al L√≥pez as the Chicago White Sox' manager. The White Sox had been runners-up in the American League for three successive seasons (1963‚Äì65), averaging almost 96 victories per year, but Stanky's maiden squad won only 83 games and fell to fourth place. However, his 1967 White Sox team ‚Äî built on speed and pitching but hampered by an impotent offense ‚Äî contended for the pennant until the last week of the season in a thrilling four-team race. But they lost their last five games to the lowly Kansas City Athletics and Washington Senators, and finished three games behind the surprise pennant winners, the \\"Impossible Dream\\" Boston Red Sox. In 1968, the White Sox got off to a terrible start, losing their first ten games (extending their regular-season losing streak to 15 games dating from 1967). They recovered slightly but were only 34‚Äì45 on July 11, when Stanky was fired and L√≥pez came out of retirement to reclaim his old job. Success as college baseball coach After his firing in Chicago, Stanky became the head baseball coach of the University of South Alabama in 1969, compiling a 490‚Äì195-2 (.714) record with five NCAA Baseball Tournament appearances over 14 seasons. He returned to the professional arena briefly in as manager of the Texas Rangers, succeeding Frank Lucchesi in midseason. He won his first game on June 22, but had second thoughts about leaving his adopted state of Alabama and resigned after a mere 18 hours on the job (one of the shortest managerial stints in MLB history) and went back to college coaching at South Alabama. According to Leo Durocher's autobiography, Stanky quit because he couldn't adapt to the attitudes of modern baseball players. His career MLB managerial mark was 467‚Äì435 (.518). Stanky was inducted into the Mobile Sports Hall of Fame in 1990. He died of a heart attack in 1999 at age 83 in Fairhope, Alabama. He was buried in the Catholic Cemetery of Mobile. Eddie Stanky Field, the ballpark of the University of South Alabama baseball team, is named for him.

Thomson & Co. as an illustrator for boys' story papers like Hotspur, Adventure and The Wizard under editor R. D. Low. Smith was now married with a child and no longer wanted to live in bomb- damaged London, so Thomsons bought him a house outside Dundee, where they had their headquarters, paid for from deductions from his wages. He also drew for their girls' comics Bunty and Judy. In 1963 he was sent to South Africa by The Scotsman newspaper to find Jeannie Stewart of the anti-apartheid group Black Sash, who had been sending the paper material but had been stopped by the South African authorities. Because his passport gave his profession as \\"artist\\", rather than \\"journalist\\", it was felt he would arouse less suspicion. He found her and, after going on safari in the Kruger National Park to maintain his cover as a tourist, was able to bring some material back for the paper. In 1972 he left D. C. Thomson's staff and went freelance, moving to Surrey, although he continued to draw for Thomsons' comics, primarily Hotspur. Strips he drew included \\"The Cowboy Cricketer\\", and \\"Nick Jolly\\", a fantasy story about an eighteenth-century highwayman brought forward in time by well- meaning aliens to fight the sinister arch-villain Simon Death on his robotic, jet-powered horse Bess. He pushed for Thomsons to publish superhero strips, and was eventually given the go-ahead to create \\"King Cobra\\", who first appeared in Hotspur in 1976King Cobra at International Hero and ran until 1980. Other titles he drew for include humour titles The Topper, The Dandy and The Beezer, and boys' adventure titles The Victor and Warlord, for which he drew \\"Drake of E-Boat Alley\\" and \\"Codename Warlord\\". He also did some uncredited work for Marvel Comics in the USA. =2000 AD= In 1979 he began drawing \\"Judge Dredd\\" for IPC's 2000 AD, and during the early to mid-1980s, Ron Smith was by far the most prolific artist working on the character. Along with Brian Bolland and Mike McMahon he contributed to two of the character's most popular epic-length stories, \\"The Day the Law Died\\" and \\"The Judge Child\\". Amongst the more grotesque characters created by Smith was Otto Sump, Mega-City One's ugliest man, with Smith excelling himself in \\"The Otto Sump Ugly Clinic\\" depicting the horrific length citizens of the metropolis go to in making themselves look as physically repulsive as possible. Smith was responsible for the majority of ugly-spin-off stories including \\"Gunge\\", \\"Who Killed Pug Ugly?\\" about an ugly pop star and \\"The League of Fatties\\" about over-eaters gone to extremes (although the first Fatty story was actually drawn by McMahon in a previous Annual). The \\"Get Ugly!\\" 2000AD cover has been used at least twice as a T-shirt design. Other Dredd stories which featured Smith at the peak of his powers were the Pat Mills scripted \\"Blood of Satanus\\" where he more than effectively depicted a man's transformation into a blood- thirsty Tyrannosaurus rex, \\"The Hot-Dog Run\\" featuring a group of cadet Judges on a training mission in the Cursed Earth and \\"The Graveyard Shift\\", an extended narrative covering one typically crime-filled night in Mega-City One. Ron Smith also co-created the anti-hero Chopper in \\"Unamerican Graffiti\\" and Dave the orang-utan who became Mayor of Mega-City One. Smith also created some of the most memorable 2000 AD cover images, and produced a number of other strips produced for the comic, including \\"Rogue Trooper\\" and \\"Chronos Carnival\\". Smith went on to draw for other IPC titles, including M.A.S.K., Eagle, Wildcat and Toxic Crusaders before retiring in the 1990s. =Daily Star= Smith also helped bring Judge Dredd and his world to a whole new audience each weekend when he was chosen to illustrate a weekly Dredd strip for the Daily Star newspaper, each story a complete vignette offering a bizarre slice of life in the future city.

Rolling Stone magazine considered him best known for writing the song \\"Smokin' in the Boys Room\\", recorded by Brownsville Station, which reached number 3 on the 1974 Billboard chart. He co-wrote and edited the All Music Guide to the Blues, and Blues for Dummies, and selected a version of each of the classic blues songs on the CD accompanying the book. He also wrote liner notes for the Trashmen, Jimmy Reed, J. B. Hutto, the Kingsmen, and the Miller Sisters, among others. Early life and career Koda was a native of Detroit, Michigan, and a graduate of Manchester High School, in Manchester, Michigan. He became interested in music as a boy, learning drums by the age of 5, and by the time he was in high school he had formed his own group, the Del- Tinos, which played rockabilly, rock and roll, and blues. The band released its first single, \\"Go Go Go\\" (a version of a Roy Orbison recording), in the fall of 1963. They released two more singles but broke up in 1966, when Koda wanted to pursue other options. Koda spent a year attending Northern Michigan University in Marquette, Michigan. Koda formed and reformed several bands at this time with other musicians in the area. His original songs and over the top performances drew crowds everywhere the band played. His habit of playing a guitar with a 'y' cord plugged into two Fender Twin Reverb amps gave him plenty of volume. He also played harp and slide guitar. After a year Koda decided college wasn't his thing and moved to Las Vegas where he worked as a sideman. This was his springboard to forming Brownsville Station. The last incarnation of his backing band regrouped as Walrus and became a local and midwest institution in their own right. Brownsville Station Koda then worked as a solo artist, releasing two singles, \\"I Got My Mojo Workin'\\" and \\"Ramblin' on My Mind\\", and working with a couple of bands, before forming Brownsville Station in 1969. Formed in Ann Arbor, Michigan, Brownsville Station also included drummer T. J. Cronley, bassist Tony Driggins, guitarist Mike Lutz, and later Bruce Nazarian and Henry Weck. The group was influenced by Chuck Berry, Bo Diddley, the Who, Jerry Lee Lewis, and Link Wray. The band began performing throughout the American Midwest and released several singles before getting noticed. They released their first album in 1970. The 1973 single \\"Smokin' in the Boys Room\\" remains their best-known song. It went to number 3 on the Billboard Hot 100 chart and eventually sold over two million copies. They continued to perform until disbanding in 1979. Other recordings by Brownsville Station include \\"The Martian Boogie\\", \\"I Get So Excited\\", \\"Rock & Roll Holiday\\", \\"Hey Little Girl\\", \\"Mama Don't Allow No Parkin'\\", \\"I Got It Bad for You\\", \\"Kings of the Party\\", \\"I'm the Leader of the Gang\\", \\"Let Your Yeah Be Yeah\\" (the title is from Matthew 5:37), \\"Lady (Put the Light on Me),\\" \\"Wanted (Dead or Alive)\\", and \\"Barefootin'\\" (the B-side of \\"Smokin' in the Boys Room). \\"Smokin' in the Boys Room\\" was later covered by M√∂tley Cr√ºe. After Brownsville Station Before the breakup of the band Koda purchased a multitrack recorder and started producing one-man band tapes of rockabilly, blues, R&B;, country, early rock and roll, and jazz, which he released as the album That's What I Like About the South. He became more focused on performing solo. He also began writing for numerous music magazines, notably his column \\"The Vinyl Junkie\\" for Goldmine Magazine (later for DISCoveries). He wrote three volumes of the acclaimed Blues Masters series. He also wrote reviews and contributed to books published by Allmusic. From late 1979 to late 1980, Koda began playing with three members of a Detroit-based band, Mugsy, calling themselves Cub Koda and the Points. Their eponymous debut album was released in early 1980 by the Boston-based Baron Records on hot pink vinyl. Also released was an EP, \\"Shake Yo Cakes.\\" Because of financial difficulties, the band broke up in late 1980 before releasing a second album. By 1980, Koda was performing with Hound Dog Taylor's backing band, the Houserockers, with guitarist Brewer Phillips and drummer Ted Harvey. They performed and recorded together for 15 years. The group's first album was It's the Blues, released in 1981. Their second album, The Joint Was Rockin' , was released in 1996. Throughout the 1980s and 1990s, Koda continued his busy schedule of touring, recording, and writing. The compilation album Smokin' in the Boy's Room: The Best of Brownsville Station, was released by Rhino Records in 1993, and Welcome to My Job, a retrospective of his non-Brownsville recordings, was released by Blue Wave Records in the same year. The following year the album Abba Dabba Dabba: A Bananza of Hits was released by Schoolkids Records. He recorded a solo album, Box Lunch, released by J-Bird Records in 1997, and recordings he made with the Del-Tinos were released by Norton Records in 1998. He also re-formed Cub Koda and the Points and released Noise Monkeys (one of his last works) in 2000. Death On June 30, 2000, while promoting his new album, he became ill. Although he had been recovering from kidney disease, which required dialysis, Koda died the next day, at age 51. He is buried in Mount Hope Cemtery in Waterloo, Michigan. His headstone features a Fender amp, with a microphone and harmonica resting on top of it. \\"I Will Always Love You, If Only in my Dreams\\" is inscribed on the table.Cub Koda at FindAGrave.com A song by Koda, \\"You're the Only Girl (Delores)\\", was included on the tribute album Daddy Rockin' Strong: A Tribute to Nolan Strong & the Diablos, released by The Wind Records in August 2010 and distributed by Norton Records. The song was included on Koda's 1994 album Abba Dabba Dabba, which had only limited release. A notable and plaintive song was \\"Random Drug Test\\", which featured the refrain \\"Pee in the cup.\\" Cub Koda was inducted into the Michigan Rock and Roll Legends Hall of Fame in 2016.https://www.michiganrockandrolllegends.com/mrrl-hall-of-fame/269-cub-koda References External links *Cub Koda at Find a Grave Category:1948 births Category:2000 deaths Category:AllMusic Category:American rock guitarists Category:American male guitarists Category:American rock singers Category:American rock songwriters Category:American male songwriters Category:Deaths from kidney failure Category:Musicians from Ann Arbor, Michigan Category:20th-century American singers Category:20th-century American guitarists Category:Songwriters from Michigan Category:Singers from Detroit Category:Guitarists from Detroit Category:20th-century American male musicians ","title":"Cub Koda"},{"id":"1243892","text":"Long Key is an island in the middle Florida Keys.

The film follows a woman locked in the London Underground overnight who finds herself being stalked by a hideously deformed killer living in the sewers below. The film was first shown at the Frankfurt Fantasy Filmfest in Germany on 10 August 2004. Plot Arthur (Ken Campbell) and George (Vas Blackwood) are two London sewage workers who discover a tunnel in one of the walls, a tunnel with which neither of them is familiar. Arthur starts exploring the tunnel alone, while newbie George stays behind. After a while, George decides to enter the tunnel too and soon discovers Arthur, injured and in a state of shock. Moments later, a similarly injured young woman jumps out in front of them, crying for help, only to be pulled back into the darkness. The focus then shifts to a young German woman, Kate (Franka Potente), at a party. After hearing that her friend Jemma went to seek George at another party without her, even though they had planned to go together, she decides to try and join her. She heads to Charing Cross Underground station but soon falls asleep on the platform while waiting for the train. When she awakens, she is alone; and the entire station has been locked up for the night. An empty train arrives, and she boards it; but it soon abruptly stops, and the lights go dark. While searching for help, she meets Guy (Jeremy Sheffield), a coworker who followed her from the party and whose awkward advances she kept rejecting. Guy, who appears to be under the influence, starts to flirt aggressively, the situation quickly escalating into a rape attempt, only to be stopped by an unseen aggressor who drags Guy out of the train. Guy briefly reemerges, covered in blood, warning Kate to run. Kate flees from the train and runs into a homeless Scottish couple living in a storeroom, Jimmy (Paul Rattray) and Mandy (Kelly Scott), and their dog Ray. Kate explains what happened, and Jimmy reluctantly agrees to help her by taking her to the night guard after she pays him. Together, they find Guy, horribly maimed and in shock but still alive. Meanwhile, Mandy, left alone, is also attacked and kidnapped, triggering Jimmy's despair and escape into a heroin-induced stupor. Kate manages to communicate with the security guard through intercom, but the man gets killed before being able to call for help. Guy, meanwhile, also dies of his wounds. Kate and Jimmy decide to walk through the tunnel to the next station. A train passes by and stops near them, and Kate fears that the maniac killer might be driving it. Jimmy decides to face him to avenge Mandy's probable death, but he is slaughtered as well. While fleeing in panic, Kate falls into the sewer system below the station, where she finds Arthur's body. Moving on from there, she ends up in a storage facility with hundreds of boxes, where she finally meets and is captured by the killer, the titular \\"creep\\"‚Äîa hideously deformed, mentally ill hermit named Craig (Sean Harris), who keeps his victims in semi-submerged, rat-infested cages until they're dead, after which he eats them. Kate finds herself in one of these cages, along with George. Together, they manage to escape and end up in an abandoned medical facility (looking like an illegal abortion clinic with a long series of fetuses lined up along a wall), where they find an unconscious Mandy strapped to a rusty surgical chair. Thinking she's dead, Kate and George move on. After they're gone, Craig puts on a surgical gown and mimics the gestures of a surgeon in front of a terrorized Mandy before he disembowels her with a bone saw while apparently mimicking an abortion procedure. Back in the railway tunnels, Kate and George find the disused railcar where Craig lives. Ray is there, along with old pictures of a medical doctor with a deformed child. Craig ambushes them, but George gains the upper hand. Kate has an opportunity to finish the creep; but Craig parrots Mandy's pleas for mercy, which confuses Kate long enough for Craig to kill George. Kate tries to run away, but she's relentlessly hunted down by Craig. In a last, desperate effort, she sinks a hook and chain in Craig's throat, then has a running train rip it apart and Craig eventually bleeds to death. Tattered and filthy, Kate eventually gets back to the initial station, by which point it's already the next morning. She collapses on a platform's floor, and Ray the dog shows up and curls onto her lap. Mistaking her for a beggar, a man waiting for the train leaves a coin next to her. Kate breaks into hysterical giggles and tears.

Reception Although the series was generally popular, it received lower ratings than its predecessor, Yongzheng Dynasty, a similar television series about the Kangxi Emperor's son and successor, the Yongzheng Emperor. The series was criticised by some for being wrought with historical inaccuracies. Critics also pointed out its unnecessary emphasis on Taiwan, a contemporary issue. Some major events during Kangxi's reign were omitted, such as his contributions to the Chinese language with the Kangxi Dictionary, and the contention for the succession among Kangxi's sons, which is featured more prominently in Yongzheng Dynasty.

The Metropolitan Railway, which opened in 1863 using gas-lit wooden carriages hauled by steam locomotives, worked with the District Railway to complete London's Circle line in 1884. Both railways expanded, the Metropolitan eventually extending as far as in Buckinghamshire, more than from Baker Street and the centre of London. The first deep-level tube line, the City and South London Railway, opened in 1890 with electric trains. This was followed by the Waterloo & City Railway in 1898, the Central London Railway in 1900, and the Great Northern and City Railway in 1904. The Underground Electric Railways Company of London (UERL) was established in 1902 to fund the electrification of the District Railway and to complete and operate three tube lines, the Baker Street and Waterloo Railway, the Charing Cross, Euston and Hampstead Railway and the Great Northern, Piccadilly and Brompton Railway, which opened in 1906‚Äì07. By 1907 the District and Metropolitan Railways had electrified the underground sections of their lines. Under a joint marketing agreement between most of the companies in the early years of the 20th century, UNDERGROUND signs appeared outside stations in central London. World War I delayed extensions of the Bakerloo and Central London Railways, and people used the tube stations as shelters during air raids in 1915. After the war, government-backed financial guarantees were used to expand the network, and the tunnels of the City and South London and Charing Cross, Euston and Hampstead Railways were linked at Euston and Kennington, although the combined service was not named the Northern line until later. The Piccadilly line was extended north to Cockfosters and took over District line branches to Harrow (later Uxbridge) and Hounslow. In 1933, the underground railways and all London area tram and bus operators were merged into the London Passenger Transport Board (LPTB). The outlying branches of the Metropolitan were closed; various upgrades were planned. The Bakerloo line's extension to take over the Metropolitan's Stanmore branch, and extensions of the Central and Northern lines, formed part of the 1930s New Works Programme. The outbreak of World War II in 1939 halted or interrupted some of this work, and many tube stations were used as air-raid shelters. The LPTB was nationalised in 1948, and the reconstruction of the mainline railways was given priority over the maintenance of the Underground. In 1953 an unpainted aluminium train entered service on the District line, and this became the standard for new trains. In the early 1960s the Metropolitan line was electrified as far as Amersham, and steam locomotives no longer hauled passenger trains. The Victoria line, a new tube line across central London, opened in 1968‚Äì71 with trains driven automatically. In 1976 the isolated Northern City Line was taken over by British Rail and linked up with the mainline railway at Finsbury Park. In 1979 another new route, the Jubilee line, took over part of the Bakerloo line; it was extended through the Docklands to Stratford in 1999. Under the control of the Greater London Council, London Transport introduced in 1981 a system of fare zones for buses and underground trains that cut the average fare. Fares increased following a legal challenge but the fare zones were retained, and in the mid-1980s the Travelcard and the Capitalcard were introduced. In the early years of the 21st century, London Underground was reorganised in a public‚Äìprivate partnership where private companies upgraded and maintained the infrastructure. In 2003 control passed to Transport for London (TfL), which had been opposed to the arrangement and, following financial failure of the infrastructure companies, had taken full responsibility by 2010. The contactless Oyster card first went on sale in 2003. The East London line closed in 2007 to be converted into a London Overground line, and in December 2009 the Circle line changed from serving a closed loop around the centre of London to a spiral also serving Hammersmith. Currently there is an upgrade programme to increase capacity on several Underground lines, and work is under way on a Northern line extension to Battersea. The first underground railways (1863‚Äì1905) Fowler's Ghost was an experimental fireless steam locomotive designed by John Fowler to prevent smoke and steam underground. It was not considered a success, and condensing steam locomotives were used. In the first half of the 19th century, London had grown greatly and the development of a commuting population arriving by train each day led to traffic congestion with carts, cabs and omnibuses filling the roads. By 1850 there were seven railway termini located around the urban centre of London and the concept of an underground railway linking the City of London with these stations was first proposed in the 1830s. Charles Pearson, Solicitor to the City of London, was a leading promoter of several schemes, and he contributed to the creation of the City Terminus Company to build such a railway from Farringdon to King's Cross in 1852 . Although the plan was supported by the City of London, the railway companies were not interested and the company struggled to proceed. In 1854 the Metropolitan Railway (also known as the Met) was granted permission to build an underground line at an estimated cost of ¬£1 million. With the Crimean War under way, the Met found it hard to raise the capital, and construction did not start until March 1860. The railway was mostly built using the \\"cut- and-cover\\" method from Paddington to King's Cross; east of King's Cross it was built by tunnelling and then followed the culverted River Fleet in an open cutting to the new meat market at Smithfield. The railway opened to the public on 10 January 1863, using steam locomotives hauling wooden carriages. It was hailed as a success, carrying 38,000 passengers on the opening day, borrowing trains from other railways to supplement the service. In the first twelve months 9.5 million passengers were carried and in the second twelve months this increased to 12 million. The Met's early success prompted a flurry of applications to parliament in 1863 for new railways in London, many competing for similar routes. The House of Lords established a select committee that recommended an \\"inner circuit of railway that should abut, if not actually join, nearly all of the principal railway termini in the Metropolis\\". Proposals to extend the Met were accepted, and the committee agreed a proposal that a new company, the Metropolitan District Railway (commonly known as the District Railway), be formed to complete the circuit. Initially, the District and the Met were closely associated and it was intended that they would merge. The Met's chairman and three other directors were on the board of the District, John Fowler was the engineer of both companies. The construction works for the extensions were let as a single contract and the Met initially operated all the services. Struggling under the burden of high construction costs, the District's level of debt meant that merger was no longer attractive to the Met and its directors resigned from the District's board. To improve its finances, the District terminated the operating agreement and began operating its own trains. Conflict between the Met and the District and the expense of construction delayed further progress on the completion of the inner circle. In 1879, the Met now wishing to access the South Eastern Railway via the East London Railway (ELR), an Act of Parliament was obtained to complete the circle and link to the ELR. After an official opening ceremony on 17 September and trial running, a complete Circle line service started on 6 October 1884. The Metropolitan Railway had been extended soon after opening, reaching Hammersmith with the Great Western Railway in 1864 and Richmond over the tracks of the London and South Western Railway (L&SWR;) in 1877. The Metropolitan & St John's Wood Railway opened as a single track branch from Baker Street to Swiss Cottage, and this was to become the Met's most important route as it expanded north into the Middlesex countryside, where it stimulated the development of new suburbs. Harrow was reached in 1880, and the line eventually extended as far as in Buckinghamshire, more than from Baker Street and the centre of London. From the end of the 19th century, the railway shared tracks with the Great Central Railway route out of . By 1871, when the District began operating its own trains, the railway had extended to West Brompton and a terminus at Mansion House. Hammersmith was reached from Earl's Court and services reached Richmond, Ealing, Hounslow and Wimbledon. As part of the project that completed the Circle line in October 1884, the District began to serve Whitechapel. As a result of the expansion, by 1898, 550 trains operated daily.Ackroyd, P. (2012). London Under. London: Vintage Books. Services began running to Upminster in 1902, after a link to the London, Tilbury & Southend Railway had been built. Electric underground railways (1900‚Äì1908) =Deep-level tubes= Central line opened as the \\"Twopenny tube\\" in 1900. A Northern line train leaves a tunnel mouth just north of Hendon Central station. In 1869, a passage was dug through the London Clay under the Thames from Great Tower Hill to Pickle Herring Stairs near Vine Street (now Vine Lane). A circular tunnel was dug , using a wrought iron shield, a method that had been patented in 1864 by Peter William Barlow. A railway was laid in the tunnel and from August 1870 a wooden carriage conveyed passengers from one side to the other. This was uneconomic and the company went bankrupt by the end of the year and the tunnel was converted to pedestrian use, becoming known as the Tower Subway. Construction of the City and South London Railway (C&SLR;) was started in 1886 by James Henry Greathead using a development of Barlow's shield. Two circular tunnels were dug between King William Street (close to today's Monument station) and Elephant and Castle. From Elephant and Castle, the tunnels were a slightly larger to Stockwell.The Northern Line, A Short History by M A C Horne (page 9) This was a legacy of the original intention to haul the trains by cable. The tunnels were bored under the roads to avoid the need for agreement with owners of property on the surface. The original intention to cable-haul the trains changed to electric power when the cable company went bankrupt. A conductor rail energised with +500 volts DC conductor rail for the northbound tunnel and ‚àí500 volts for the southbound laid between the running rails, though offset from the centreline, powered the electric locomotives that hauled the carriages. The carriages were fitted with small windows and consequently were nicknamed padded cells.The Northern Line, A Short History by M A C Horne (page 12) By 1907, the C&SLR; had extended from both ends, south to Clapham Common and north to Euston. In 1898, the Waterloo & City Railway was opened between London & South Western Railway's terminus at Waterloo station and a station in the City. Operated by the L&SWR;, the short electrified line used four-car electric multiple units. Two diameter tunnels were dug beneath the roads between Shepherd's Bush and Bank for the Central London Railway (CLR). In 1900 this opened, charging a flat fare of 2d (approximately p today), becoming known as the \\"Twopenny tube\\" and by the end of the year carrying nearly 15 million passengers. Initially electric locomotives hauled carriages, but the heavy locomotives caused vibrations that could be felt on the surface. In 1902‚Äì03 the carriages were reformed into multiple units using a control system developed by Frank Sprague in Chicago. The CLR was extended to Wood Lane (near White City) in 1908 and Liverpool Street in 1912. The Great Northern & City Railway was built to take main line trains from the Great Northern Railway (GNR) at Finsbury Park to the City at a terminus at Moorgate. However the GNR refused permission for trains to use its Finsbury Park station, so platforms were built beneath the station instead and public service on the line, using electric multiple units, began in 1904. =District and Metropolitan electrification= Electrification ‚Äì 1907 drawing of Metropolitan Railway ‚Äì Ruislip and Harrow sub-stations On the District and Metropolitan Railways, the use of steam locomotives led to smoke-filled stations and carriages that were unpopular with passengers and electrification was seen as the way forward. Electric traction was still in its infancy and agreement would be needed between the two companies because of the shared ownership of the inner circle. In 1901 a Metropolitan and District joint committee recommended the Ganz three-phase AC system with overhead wires. Initially this was accepted by both parties, until the District found an investor, the American Charles Yerkes, to finance the upgrade. Yerkes raised ¬£1 million (1901 pounds adjusted by inflation are ¬£) and soon had control of the District Railway. His experiences in the United States led him to favour DC similar to that in use on the City & South London Railway and Central London Railway. The Metropolitan Railway protested about the change of plan, but after arbitration by the Board of Trade the DC system was adopted. The Metropolitan electrified its new line from Harrow to Uxbridge and the route to the inner circle at Baker Street, using separate positive and negative conductor rails energised at 550‚Äì600 V. The District electrified its unopened line from Mill Hill Park (now Acton Town) to South Harrow and used this line to test its new trains and train drivers. Electric multiple units began running on the Metropolitan in January 1905 and by March all local services between Baker Street and Harrow were electric. Electric services began on the District Railway in June 1905 between Hounslow and South Acton. In July 1905 the District began running electric trains from Ealing to Whitechapel and on the same day the Met and the District both introduced electric units on the inner circle until later that day an incompatibility was found between the way the shoe-gear was mounted on the Met trains and the District track. The Met trains were withdrawn from the District lines and modified, full electric service starting on the circle line in September. In the same month, after withdrawing services over the un- electrified East London Railway and east of East Ham, the District were running electric services on all remaining routes. The GWR electrified the line between Paddington and Hammersmith and the branch from Latimer Road to Kensington (Addison Road). An electric service with jointly owned rolling stock started on the route in November 1906. In the same year, the Met suspended running on the East London Railway, terminating instead at the District's station at Whitechapel. The Metropolitan Railway beyond Harrow was not electrified so services were hauled by an electric locomotive from Baker Street and changed for a steam locomotive en route. Integration (1902‚Äì1933) =Underground Electric Railways Company of London= Russell Square station, an example of the Leslie Green design used for the UERL's stationsalt=A red glazed terracotta building. The first storey above ground features four wide, storey-height semi-circular windows with smaller circular windows between above which is a dentil cornice. Below the two right-most windows, the station name, \\"Russell Square Station\\", is displayed in gold lettering moulded into the terracotta panels. A blue tiled panel above the entrance says \\"Underground\\". The Charing Cross, Euston and Hampstead Railway, was authorised from Charing Cross to Hampstead and Highgate in 1893, but had not found financial backing. Yerkes bought the rights in 1900, and obtained additional approval for a branch from Camden Town to Golders Green. The Baker Street and Waterloo Railway had been authorised to run from Baker Street to Waterloo station. Work began in 1898, and extensions to Paddington station and Elephant & Castle were authorised in 1900, but came to a halt with the collapse of their financial backers in 1901. Yerkes bought the rights to this railway in 1902. The District had permission for a deep-level tube from Earl's Court to Mansion House and in 1898 had bought the Brompton and Piccadilly Circus Railway that had authority for a tube from South Kensington to Piccadilly Circus. The District's plans were combined by Yerkes with those of the Great Northern and Strand Railway, a tube railway with permission to build a line from Strand to Finsbury Park, to create the Great Northern, Piccadilly and Brompton Railway. In April 1902, the Underground Electric Railways Company of London (UERL) was established, with Yerkes as chairman, to control these companies and manage the planned works. On 8 June 1902, the UERL took over the Metropolitan District Traction Company. The UERL built a large power station that would be capable of providing power for the District and underground lines under construction. Work began in 1902 at Lots Road, by Chelsea Creek, and in February 1905 Lots Road Power Station began generating electricity. For the three lines similar electric multiple units were purchased, known as \\"Gate Stock\\" as access to the cars was via lattice gates at each end operated by gatemen. As on the District Railway the track was provided with separate positive and negative conductor rails, in what was to become a London Underground standard. A number of the surface buildings, with an exterior of glazed dark red bricks, were designed by Leslie Green and 140 electric lifts were imported from America from the Otis Elevator Company. A length of the Baker Street & Waterloo between Baker Street and Kennington Road (now Lambeth North) opened in March 1906, and the line reached Edgware Road the following year. It was named the 'Bakerloo' in July 1906, called an undignified \\"gutter title\\" by The Railway Magazine. The Great Northern, Piccadilly & Brompton Railway (the Piccadilly) opened from Finsbury Park to Hammersmith in December 1906, the Aldwych branch opening the following year. \\"Moving staircases\\" or escalators were first installed at Earl's Court between the District and Piccadilly line platforms, and at all deep level tube stations after 1912. The last, the Charing Cross, Euston & Hampstead (the Hampstead) opened in 1907, and ran from to Camden Town, before splitting into two branches going to Golders Green and Highgate (now Archway). =London Underground= alt=A map titled \\"London Underground Railways\\" showing each of the underground railway lines in a different colour with stations marked as blobs. Faint background detail shows the River Thames, roads and non- underground lines. To promote travel by the underground railways in London a joint marketing arrangement was agreed that included maps, joint publicity and through ticketing. UNDERGROUND signs were used outside stations in Central London. The UERL acquired London bus and tram companies in 1912 and the following year the City & South London and Central London Railway joined the company. That year the Great Northern & City was taken over by the Met. Suggestions of merger with the Underground Group were rejected by the Metropolitan, a press release of November 1912 noting its interests in areas outside London, its relationships with main line railways and its freight business. Further coordination in the form of a General Managers' Conference faltered after the Metropolitan withdrew in 1911 when the Central London Railway, without any reference to the conference, set its season ticket prices significantly lower than those on the Met's competitive routes. The UERL introduced station name boards with a red disc and a blue bar and the Met responded with station boards showing a blue bar on a red diamond. In 1913 the Bakerloo line reached Paddington, and the following year the Hampstead line was extended south of its Charing Cross terminus to an expanded interchange station (currently known as Embankment) with the Bakerloo and District lines. The Bakerloo line was extended north to Queen's Park to link up with the London & North Western Railway's new electric line from Euston to Watford Junction. The start of World War I in 1914 delayed construction, trains reaching Queen's Park in 1915 and in 1917. An extension of the Central line west to Ealing was started in 1913 and, also delayed by the war, was completed in 1920. The war saw growth in traffic and a shortage of men, so women were recruited as temporary replacements in traditional men's jobs such as guards, clerks, painters and cleaners. London saw its first air raids in 1915, and people used the tube stations as bomb shelters. There was major expansion of what was to become the Northern line in the 1920s After the war new trains were purchased to run on the Metropolitan, District, Bakerloo and Piccadilly lines, the Piccadilly line trains having air-operated sliding doors. In the 1920s, taking advantage of government backed financial guarantees for capital projects that promoted employment, there were major extensions of the City & South London and the Hampstead lines. The tunnels of the City & South London Railway were rebuilt to have the same diameter of the other tubes, and the extended north from Euston to a junction with the Hampstead line at Camden Town, and south to Morden. The Hampstead line was extended to the north from Golders Green to Edgware and south to another junction with the City & South London at Kennington, this opening in 1926. Although physically connected, the lines were still officially named the City Railway and Hampstead & Highgate line. The lines were to be known as the Edgware, Highgate and Morden and the Morden-Edgware until finally renamed the Northern line in 1937. Also during the 1920s the original tube gate stock was replaced with 1,460 cars of Standard Stock with air-operating sliding doors, except for the Central line where the cars were refurbished. Busy central London stations were modernised with escalators replacing lifts. Unlike other railway companies in the London area, the Met was able to develop land for housing. After World War I they promoted housing estates near the railway with the \\"Metro-land\\" brand and nine housing estates were built near stations on the line. Taking advantage of the Treasury guarantees electrification was extended north from Harrow to Rickmansworth and a short branch opened from Rickmansworth to Watford in 1925. In the 1920s more powerful electric and steam locomotives were purchased and Metropolitan Railway stations were redesigned by their architect Charles W Clark. With finance guaranteed by the government the Piccadilly lines and Metropolitan were extended in the early 1930s. The Metropolitan opened a line from Wembley Park to Stanmore, and the Piccadilly line was to extend north from Finsbury Park to Cockfosters and west from Hammersmith and took over the District line Harrow and Hounslow branches. Several stations were rebuilt in a Modernist style influenced or designed by Charles Holden, who called them his 'brick boxes with concrete lids'. Piccadilly line trains took over the District service to South Harrow in 1932, reaching Uxbridge the following year. Piccadilly trains reached Cockfosters and Hounslow West in 1933, although District line services to Hounslow continued until 1964. London Passenger Transport Board (1933‚Äì1947) In 1933, Harry Beck's diagrammatic tube map appeared for the first time. On 1 July 1933, the London Passenger Transport Board (LPTB), was created as a public corporation and the Metropolitan, the UERL underground railways, tramway companies and bus operators were merged into one organisation. On the former Metropolitan Railway the Brill Branch closed in 1935, followed by the line from to Verney Junction in 1936. It was proposed to electrify to Amersham with additional tracks from Harrow to Rickmansworth and to extend the Bakerloo line to Stanmore to relieve the bottleneck on the Metropolitan from Baker Street to Finchley. Before any work was started on the Met, the 1935‚Äì1940 New Works Programme was announced. This included extending the Central line to Stratford and then onto Epping and Ongar and the Northern line was to be extended north to High Barnet, Alexandra Palace and Bushey Heath and link up with the isolated Great Northern & City Railway, renamed the Northern City Line, which was to be extended beyond Finsbury Park to link up at Highgate. A tube station being used as an air raid shelter New trains were delivered before the outbreak of World War II in 1939, including 573 cars for the District and Metropolitan lines and 1,121 new cars (1938 Stock) for the tube lines. Following the outbreak of war, services on the Northern line between Strand (now Charing Cross) and Kennington were suspended as the tunnels under the Thames were blocked as a defence against flooding. The Metropolitan Pullman cars were placed into store and first class was removed from London Underground services. The New Works Programme continued, albeit at a reduced pace, the Bakerloo line taking over the Stanmore branch from the Metropolitan in November 1939. The Northern line reached Mill Hill East in May 1941, but by then work on the other Northern and Central line extensions had been suspended. The bombing of London and especially the Blitz led to the use of many tube stations as air-raid shelters, with 175,000 people arriving every night in August 1940. Six stations were breached by a direct hit, and in March 1943, 173 people died in a crowd crush accident at the unfinished Bethnal Green station. In the 1940s a depot built for the Northern line extension and an unfinished stretch of the Central line extension, the underground section between Newbury Park and Leytonstone, was turned into aircraft factory. The closed Brompton Road station was used as an anti-aircraft control room. The closed Down Street station was used by Winston Churchill and the War Cabinet and the Railway Emergency Committee. Before the war, the Olympia exhibition centre had been served by the Metropolitan line and by a service from Earl's Court to . Following bombing in 1940 passenger services over the West London Line were suspended. This left the exhibition centre without a railway service, so after the war the station was renamed Kensington (Olympia) and served by a District line shuttle from Earl's Court. The Central line extensions in east and west London were completed, tube trains running to Epping from 1949. Nationalisation (1947‚Äì2000) Britain's railways were nationalised on 1 January 1948, and London Transport placed under the authority of the British Transport Commission (BTC). The BTC prioritised the reconstruction of the main line railways over the maintenance of the Underground and most of the unfinished plans of the 1935‚Äì40 New Works Programme were shelved or postponed. For the tube lines new cars (1949 Stock) were built to run with the 1938 stock. Some of the cars on the District line were in need of replacement, and in 1953 an unpainted aluminium train (R Stock) entered service, and this became the standard for new trains, and was followed by 1959 tube stock. After experiments with an AEC lightweight diesel multiple unit in 1952, steam trains were removed from the Central line following the electrification of the Epping‚ÄìOngar section in 1957. In the early 1960s the unpainted aluminium A Stock took over Metropolitan line services from Baker Street to Uxbridge, Watford and Amersham Between 1963 and 1970, London Transport reported directly to the Minister of Transport, before control passed to the Greater London Council. Electrification work on the Metropolitan line, suspended due to the war, had restarted in 1959. The line was electrified to and the unpainted aluminium (A Stock) replaced steam trains, British Rail providing services for the former Metropolitan line stations between Amersham and . =Victoria line and Jubilee line= The Victoria line was recommended in a 1949 report as it would reduce congestion on other lines. After some experimental tunnelling in 1959, construction began in 1963 and, unlike the earlier tubes, the tunnels did not have to follow the roads above. The line was originally approved to run from Walthamstow to Victoria station, the extension to Brixton being authorised later. As part of the works, Oxford Circus station was rebuilt to allow interchange with the Central and Bakerloo lines. Cross platform interchanges were built at Euston, Highbury & Islington and Finsbury Park. After running trains from Walthamstow, first to Finsbury Park and then to Warren Street in 1968, the line to Victoria was officially opened in March 1969. The extension to Brixton opened in 1971. Designed for automatic train operation, access to the platforms was by using magnetically encoded tickets collected by automatic gates. The Moorgate tube crash occurred on 28 February 1975 on the isolated Northern City Line when a southbound train failed to stop at the Moorgate terminus and crashed into the wall at end of the tunnel, killing forty-four people. No fault was found with the train equipment, the subsequent report found that there was insufficient evidence to determine the cause. Following the incident, a system that stops a train automatically if the driver fails to brake was introduced at dead-ends on the London Underground. The Northern City Line was connected to British Rail tracks at Finsbury Park in the 1970s. The last tube train ran in October 1975, and British Rail services began in 1976. In 1977, the Piccadilly line was extended from Hounslow to Heathrow Airport, and in 1986 a platform serving Terminal 4 opened on a loop line. The Fleet line through central London was first proposed in 1965, taking over the Bakerloo line's Stanmore branch at Baker Street and then running via Fleet Street to Lewisham. To simplify planning the construction was divided into stages, and the first stage from Baker Street to Charing Cross had all the necessary approvals by 1971. Work began the following year and tunnelling had been completed in 1976. After the line had been renamed the Jubilee line in honour of Queen Elizabeth's Silver Jubilee in 1977, the line opened in April 1979 using trains that had been running on the Bakerloo line. =1980s= In 1981, the Greater London Council (GLC) introduced the 'Fares Fair' scheme, a system of fare zones for bus and underground trains, cutting the average fare by 32 per cent. This was challenged in court, the GLC lost and fares doubled in 1982. The fare zones were retained and fares dropped slightly the following year. In 1983 the Travelcard allowed travel within the specified zones on buses and underground trains, and was followed in Capitalcard in 1985 that included British Rail services. In 1984 control of London Buses and the London Underground passed to London Regional Transport (LRT), which reported directly to Secretary of State for Transport. By the early 1980s, the pre-war trains had been replaced by new unpainted aluminium trains. One person operation had been planned in 1968, but conflict with the trade unions delayed introduction. The Metropolitan, East London, District and Circle lines were converted in 1985‚Äì86, the Piccadilly, Jubilee and Bakerloo lines following in 1987‚Äì88. One Person Operation was introduced on the Central and Northern lines after they received new trains in the early 1990s. King's Cross fire The King's Cross fire killed 31 people in November 1987 when a lit match set fire to a wooden escalator. In the subsequent report London Underground was strongly criticised for its attitude to fires Scan available online at railwaysarchive.co.uk. Retrieved 27 October 2012. and its publication led to resignations of senior management in both London Underground and London Regional Transport and to the introduction of new fire safety regulations. A Fire Safety Code of Practice was drawn up for rolling stock and this led to internal refurbishment of the trains that included replacing the interior panelling and fitting or improving the public address systems. =1990s= At the same time, the exterior of the trains were painted as it had proved difficult to remove graffiti from unpainted aluminium. The first refurbished trains were presented to the media in September 1989, and the project launched in July 1991. In 1994 LRT took over control of the Waterloo and City line. The Epping‚ÄìOngar branch of the Central line and the Aldwych branch of the Piccadilly line closed in the same year. Options were considered to link the Docklands with central London and an extension of the Jubilee line to Stratford was chosen. Approved in 1993, the stations were built to be fully accessible and with platform edge doors. There was pressure on London Transport to get the line open in time for the opening of the Millennium Dome on 1 January 2000 and the extension opened in stages from Stratford, with through running from 22 November 1999, when the Charing Cross terminus closed. Transport for London (from 2000) Transport for London (TfL) was created in 2000 as part of the Greater London Authority by the Greater London Authority Act 1999. =Public‚Äìprivate partnership= In 1999, before control was passed to TfL, London Underground was split up so that a public‚Äìprivate partnership (PPP) arrangement could be put in place, with London Underground remaining a public company running the trains while private companies were responsible for upgrading the railway. Three packages of 30-year franchises were drawn up, covering the Jubilee, Northern and Piccadilly lines (JNP), the Bakerloo, Central Victoria and Waterloo and City lines (BCV) and the sub-surface lines, the Metropolitan, District, Circle, East London and Hammersmith & City lines (SSL). In 2003 the BCV and SSL contracts were won by Metronet (a consortium of Balfour Beatty, WS Atkins, Bombardier, EDF Energy and Thames Water), while JNP was won by Tube Lines; these were known as the \\"infracos\\" (infrastructure companies). In 2000 overall control of the system passed to TfL, which had been opposed to the arrangement. Metronet went into administration in 2007, and TfL took over responsibilities, and TfL also took over Tube Lines in 2010. Creation The Mayor of London, Ken Livingstone, was sceptical about the practicality of the PPP plan, and brought in the American Bob Kiley as London's Transport Commissioner to repeat his success with the New York City Subway using public bond finance.\\"Bob Kiley: Going Underground\\". BBC News. 13 January 2001Glancey, Jonathan (2003). London, Verso Books, p. 42. Taking office in 2000 as London's first directly elected mayor, it was difficult for Livingstone to block the PPP process, which was entirely in the national Government's hands as it still owned London Underground, which was not transferred to local control until July 2003.\\"Mayor takes control of Tube\\". BBC News. 15 July 2003. Kiley was fired from the board of London Regional Transport (of which he had been chairman) in 2001 over his attempts to block the PPP scheme.Goldsmith, Charles (18 July 2001). \\"Bob Kiley Is Fired From Transport Board After Opposing U.K.'s Privatization Plans\\". The Wall Street Journal (New York). Livingstone mounted a legal challenge, but eventually dropped it as it was unlikely to succeed,Maguire, Kevin (27 July 2002). \\"Livingstone throws in the towel in fight against tube privatisation\\". The Guardian (London). and Tube Lines and Metronet reached financial close on the contracts in December 2002 and March 2003 respectively. It was later revealed that the legal challenge had cost ¬£4.2 million directly, as well as ¬£36 million reimbursed to the bidders for costs incurred because of the six-month delay. In April 2005 TfL criticised Metronet, saying it had given capital construction work to its shareholders, whilst Tube Lines, which had competitively tendered its work, was performing much better. TfL also said that new technology promised by Metronet had yet to be seen ‚Äî \\"We were supposed to be getting private sector expertise and technology with the PPP (Public Private Partnership) but instead they are just using the same old kit.\\" In March 2005, the House of Commons Public Accounts Committee, charged with ensuring value for money in public spending, published a report concluding that it was \\"impossible to determine\\" whether the PPP was better value than a publicly run investment programme, primarily because of the untested periodic review structure of the 30-year contracts. These were to be revised every 7.5 years, meaning that the ultimate price for the promised ¬£15.7 billion of investment was still unknown. It noted that using public bond finance would have saved ¬£90 million a year in financing costs, even though the Government guaranteed repayment of 95% of costs in the event of premature termination, and the contracts placed limits and exemptions on financial risk transferred to the infrastructure companies. The system still received an annual public subsidy of ¬£1 billion, but its spending was now determined entirely by the infracos' interpretation of their 2000-page PPP contracts. Although the private operators were expected to receive at least 18‚Äì20% returns on capital (for Metronet), for the type of risk associated with major upgrades, most of the work was low-risk maintenance and replacement. The public-sector procurement option (using private companies for specific major projects) would also have saved the ¬£455 million cost of concluding the PPP contracts, not to mention the five years' delay the contract negotiations caused. Performance In April 2005, Bob Kiley pressed for an urgent review of the PPP, describing its performance as \\"bordering on disaster\\". A week later the chief executive of Metronet was sacked, after complaints that it had made ¬£50m profit despite being behind on all its major works.Osborne, Alistair (14 April 2005). \\"Metronet ousts boss who was running late on Tube repairs\\". The Daily Telegraph (London). By April 2005, it had started work on only 13 station refurbishments (instead of 32 as scheduled), and was more than a year behind on the refurbishment of 78 District line trains. It was also behind on its track replacement programme, having completed 28 km instead of the scheduled 48 km. In March 2005, the House of Commons Transport Select Committee noted that \\"Availability is the most important factor for Tube travellers. All the infracos needed to do to meet their availability benchmarks was to perform only a little worse than in the past. On most lines, they did not even manage that.\\" Metronet was also declared at fault by an accident investigators' report into a May 2004 derailment at White City, for failing to implement sufficient safety checks despite being ordered to do so by TfL. TfL takes over infracos Metronet, using its shareholders as its main contractors, was unable to meet its targets and track replacement and station refurbishments fell behind schedule. With increased costs it went into administration in 2007 and TfL took over responsibilities. The UK government tried to find another private firm to fill the vacuum left by the liquidation of Metronet. However, only TfL expressed a viable interest in taking over Metronet's responsibilities. The case for PPP was also weakened in 2008 when it was revealed that the demise of Metronet had cost the UK government ¬£2bn. The five private companies that made up the Metronet alliance had to pay ¬£70m each towards paying off the debts acquired by the consortium. But due to a deal struck with the government in 2003, when the PPP scheme began operating, the companies were protected from any further liability. The UK taxpayer therefore had to foot the rest of the bill. This undermined the argument that PPP would place the risks involved in running the network into the hands of the private sector.The Railway Magazine, April 2008, p. 6. By 2010, Tube Lines was behind schedule on the Jubilee line upgrade and after conflict arose over costs of future work in that year's PPP review, TfL bought Tube Lines for ¬£310m ($458m).\\"Transport for London Buys Back Tube Lines\\". Railway Technology. 11 May 2010. =Recent history= S Stock has now replaced the old A, C and D Stocks on the Metropolitan, Circle, Hammersmith & City & District lines The Oyster card, a stored-value contactless smart card that can be used on Transport for London services instead of a ticket, first went on sale in 2003. The scheme was originally managed as a PPP by TranSys; TfL bought the rights to the Oyster card name in 2008. On 7 July 2005 three bombs exploded on underground trains, two on the Circle line at Aldgate and Edgware Road and the third on the Piccadilly line between King's Cross and Russell Square. Later the same day a bomb exploded on a bus in Woburn Place. Four suicide bombers had killed themselves and fifty-two other people, and it took over a month before underground services had been restored. In 2007 the East London line, operated as an isolated shuttle since 1939, closed so that it could be converted into a London Overground line. In December 2009 the Circle line changed from serving a closed loop around the centre of London on the north side of the River Thames to a spiral serving Hammersmith. On the Jubilee line a seventh car was added to all trains, in 2006 and a new signalling system allowing automatic operation was commissioned in 2011. On the Victoria line, new trains were introduced between July 2009 and June 2011, and a new signalling system has allowed 33 trains per hour from January 2013. The sub- surface (Metropolitan, District, Circle and Hammersmith & City) lines have been upgraded, with new air-conditioned S Stock. Also, the sub-surface track, electrical supply and signalling systems are also being upgraded in a programme allowing an increased peak-hour capacity by the end of 2018. A single control room for the sub-surface network is to be established in Hammersmith and an automatic train control (ATC) system will replace signalling equipment installed from the 1940s. During the 2020 UK Outbreak of COVID-19, Transport for London (TfL) services were reduced in stages. After growing concern that amongst the outbreak and despite government advice on social distancing, tube services were still crowded . All Night Overground and Night Tube services, as well as all services on the Waterloo & City line, were suspended from 20 March, and 40 tube stations were closed on the same day. The Mayor of London and TfL urged people to only use public transport if absolutely essential, so that it could be used by critical workers. The London Underground brought in new measures on 25 March to combat the spread of the virus, by slowing the flow of passengers onto platforms, which included the imposition of queuing at ticket gates and turning off some escalators. Even with these measures in place there was still criticism that, especially in rush hour, some stations and trains were still experiencing crowding ; however, statistics showed that the tube was experiencing some of the lowest passenger journey numbers since the 1800s . Goods traffic Goods trains ran over Metropolitan tracks from 1866 when the Great Northern Railway (GNR) and then the Midland Railways began a service to south of the Thames via Farringdon and Snow Hill tunnel. Goods depots were opened in the Farringdon area, accessed from the City Widened Lines. The GWR opened Smithfield Market Sidings in 1869, the GNR opened its depot in 1874, and the Midland in 1878. The Midland also negotiated running rights over the District Railway from the London & South Western Railway at Hammersmith to South Kensington in 1876 and in 1878 it opened coal depots at Kensington High Street and West Kensington. Goods traffic was to play an important part of Metropolitan traffic on the extension line out of Baker Street. In 1880, the Met started conveying coal from Finchley Road to Harrow. Goods and coal depots were provided at most of the stations on the extension line as they were built. Goods for London were initially handled at Willesden, with delivery by road or by transfer to the Midland. In 1909, the Met opened Vine Street goods depot near Farringdon with a regular service from West Hampstead. Coal for the steam locomotives, the company's electric power station at Neasden and local gasworks were brought in via Quainton Road. Milk was delivered to the London suburbs and foodstuffs from Vine Street to Uxbridge. Fish to Billingsgate Market via the Met and the District joint station at Monument caused some complaints, leaving the station approaches in an \\"indescribably filthy condition\\". The District suggested a separate entrance for the fish, but nothing was done. The traffic reduced significantly when road transport was introduced from to Marylebone, but the problem remained until 1936, being one reason the LPTB gave for abolishing the carrying of parcels on trains. The LPTB was also not interested in running the Metropolitan goods services. Vine Street goods station closed in 1936, and the London and North Eastern Railway (LNER) took over all freight traffic from in 1937. When the Northern line was extended over the lines of the LNER to High Barnet and Mill Hill East in 1940, the stations retained their goods service. Starting at midnight trains would leave Highbury every five to ten minutes and access the line from Finsbury Park via Highgate High Level. The Central line stations also kept their goods service, worked from Temple Mills and accessed via Leytonstone, the Hainault loop stations being served via Woodford. Goods services were withdrawn in the 1950s and '60s. The GNR goods depot on the City Widened Lines closed in 1956 and Smithfield Market was last served by train in 1962. Goods yards on the Uxbridge branch closed in 1964, and Northern line stations saw their last goods train in the same year. The closure of West Kensington yard the following year meant the withdrawal of goods trains from District and Piccadilly tracks. On the Central line, Hainault loop stations lost their goods service in 1965, and in 1966 the rest of the line followed.

biologist. Aukerman is most widely known for being the lead singer of the punk rock band the Descendents, a group widely considered to be pioneers of \\"pop punk\\". A caricature of Aukerman serves as the band's mascot. Education and scientific career Aukerman attended Mira Costa High School, with fellow members of the Descendents. He holds a doctorate in biology from UC San Diego, conducted postdoctoral research in molecular biology at the University of Wisconsin‚ÄìMadison and the University of Pennsylvania, and formerly worked as a plant researcher at DuPont and as an adjunct professor at the University of Delaware. In a 2016 interview with Spin, Aukerman announced that he decided to quit researching in favor of doing music full-time. Musical career While not an original member, Aukerman joined Descendents after their first single was released (\\"Ride the Wild\\" b/w \\"It's a Hectic World\\"), which featured founding members Frank Navetta and Tony Lombardo on lead vocals. Aukerman's first recording with Descendents was the Fat EP, released in 1981. The first full length Descendents album was released in 1982 and was titled Milo Goes to College, as Aukerman had by then decided to leave the group to pursue a degree in biochemistry at the University of California, San Diego. From 1983 to 1987 Aukerman would briefly rejoin Descendents several times to record albums and go on tour. Aukerman left the band ostensibly for good at the conclusion of the supporting tour for the 1987 album All, after which the remaining members continued to tour and record with a series of lead singers under the name All. Aukerman decided to rejoin Descendents in 1995, releasing the album Everything Sucks the following year. He returned to his molecular biology career following the tour supporting the album, returning to Descendents intermittently over the next several years to tour and to record the album Cool to Be You and the EP 'Merican, both released in 2004 on Fat Wreck Chords. In July 2016, Aukerman announced he would be leaving his scientific career to pursue the Descendents full-time, citing burnout with biochemistry and getting laid off from DuPont. The band released their seventh studio album, Hypercaffium Spazzinate, on July 29, 2016. As a musician, Aukerman sings in a mid-range tenor, and his generally upbeat lyrics encompass such universal topics as girls/rejection, dependence upon caffeine, and the never-ending quest for good food. He is known for his bespectacled, unabashedly nerdy persona and self-deprecating, \\"anti-rockstar\\" demeanor. Apart from his work with Descendents, Aukerman has also provided backing vocals for other musicians (including Descendents offshoot All), and briefly fronted the band Milestone in 1988 in San Diego while attending university. Personal life Aukerman was born on January 1, 1963 in Los Angeles, California. He has been married to Robin Andreasen since 1995 and is the father of two children, Owen and Claire Andreasen.

He was the first presiding judge of the ongoing reality court show The People's Court. The court show's first run in syndication, with Wapner presiding as judge, lasted from 1981 to 1993, for 12 seasons and 2,484 episodes. While the show's second run has been presided over by multiple judges, Wapner was the sole judge to preside during the court show's first run. His tenure on the program made him the first jurist of arbitration-based reality court shows, which are now a most popular trend in the judicial genre. Early life Joseph Albert Wapner was born on November 15, 1919, in Los Angeles, California, to Jewish parents who had immigrated there; his father, attorney Joseph Max Wapner (1898-1992), was from Romania, while his mother, Fannie (n√©e Friedman) (1900-1990), was from Russia. Wapner had a younger sister named Irene. Wapner attended Hollywood High School and once dated actress Lana Turner while in high school. Wapner was a graduate of the University of Southern California (1941) and the USC Law School (1948), serving in World War II in between. Wapner was awarded the Purple Heart and the Bronze Star while serving in the South Pacific in Cebu. He was honorably discharged from the United States Army as a lieutenant. Career =Legal career= Wapner was an attorney in private practice for ten years. Appointed by Governor Pat Brown to the Los Angeles Municipal Court in 1959,Okamoto, Sherri M., Wapner: From Jurist to TV Star to the Man on the Root Beer Bottle, Metropolitan News-Enterprise, July 17, 2009, page 3 Wapner served two years before being elevated to the Los Angeles County Superior Court, where he served for 18 years before retiring. While serving on the Superior Court bench, Wapner also served as presiding judge in 1969 and 1970. Wapner was also president of the California Judges Association in 1975 and 1976, and retired from the court on November 16, 1979. =The People's Court= Wapner was the first judge to preside over the court show The People's Court. His tenure on the program lasted from 1981 to 1993, making for a grand total of 2,340 half- hour episodes. On the series, he conducted a binding arbitration that was set up to resemble a small claims court by pitting parties, without lawyers, against each other. The legacy of the show's high popularity has led to myriad other similar syndicated courtroom shows, such as Judge Judy and Hot Bench, among others. After 12 seasons on The People's Court, Wapner was not invited back to the series in 1993, when the ratings had dropped to an all-time low.\\"People's Court Free TV Show Tickets in New York City\\". New York Show Tickets, 2013, accessed November 26, 2013 After a four-year hiatus, beginning in 1993, The People's Court returned to the air in 1997, though without Wapner, and still runs today. Wapner has stated that he was told years later that the producers did not want to hurt his feelings; however, he stated that this is exactly what the show did. Wapner also stated that he was not notified when the producers decided to revamp the series. He declined to offer any opinions on the People's Court judges who succeeded him, as he never watched the revamped program.Joseph A. Wapner Interview, Archive of American Television, July 11, 2005, accessed November 26, 2013 On November 12, 2009, Wapner received a star on the Hollywood Walk of Fame. He and Judith Sheindlin of the television court show Judge Judy were the only two television jurists who have received the honor as of 2009. Wapner was publicly critical of Sheindlin's courtroom approach. On November 13, 2009, in honor of his 90th birthday on November 15, Wapner made a one-time-only return to the court show, acting as a guest judge, presiding over a case in the Marilyn Milian era of The People's Court. Until the summer of 2013, Wapner also held the title of longest-reigning arbiter over The People's Court. However, by completion of the court show's 2012‚Äì2013 season, Marilyn Milian captured this title from him and became the longest-reigning judge over the series. = Other media appearances and endeavors = Five years after presiding over The People's Court, Wapner returned to television as a judge on the nontraditional courtroom series Judge Wapner's Animal Court, lasting for two seasons (1998‚Äì1999 and 1999‚Äì2000) on Animal Planet. Wapner authored a book, A View from the Bench (1987, Simon and Schuster, ). He appeared in the second episode of Sliders as himself, in an alternative world where the Soviet Union has conquered the USA. The People's Court is instead a criminal court that hands out long prison sentences, and he is referred as \\"Commissar Wapner\\" rather than judge. On August 9, 2008, Wapner appeared as Judge in a Major League Baseball on Fox pregame People's Court parody segment called \\"The Players Court\\". On Alice Coopers 1983 album ‚ÄúDaDa‚Äù there is ‚ÄúSpecial Thanks to Judge Joseph A. Wapner‚Äù on the back cover. On June 27, 1986, Wapner appeared on the Tonight Show to hear a case of David Letterman vs. Johnny Carson over alleged damage to the headlight of Letterman's pickup truck when Carson had the truck towed to the studio. Wapner ruled in favor of Letterman, granting him $24.95. =Endorsements= During 1999‚Äì2000, Wapner served as the national spokesperson for Singer Asset Finance Company, LLC, a specialty finance company, appearing in national television commercials and print ads. Since around 2010, the soda company Rocket Fizz has marketed a beverage, Judge Wapner Root Beer, featuring the slogan, \\"I sentence you to drink my root beer.\\"  Personal life, final years and death Wapner was active in Jewish causes, including sitting on the board of a Jewish school. He married Mildred \\"Mickey\\" Nebenzahl in 1946. Their daughter Sarah died from heart disease in May 2015 at age 56.

It extends from Forest Avenue at its southernmost border to the city limits at its northern border. Once considered the rural, western edge of nineteenth century Des Moines, what is now Beaverdale consisted of large land tracts devoted to fruit orchards and truck farms. Early traffic crossed the area on an unpaved stagecoach highway known, since before the Civil War, as the Fort Dodge Stage Road. The road was renamed Beaver Avenue in 1903 and was later improved in 1917 with brick paving. The entire northwest section of Des Moines was commonly known as \\"Urbandale\\" until 1917, when the name was formally adopted by an adjacent suburban village. Soon afterwards, city residents from the area met and selected \\"Beaverdale\\" as the name to identify their neighborhood. Most of the subdivisions were developed in the period between 1920 and 1940, when cars were becoming an essential part of every household. A major phase of construction occurred after the economic depression of the 1930s. Federal mortgage financing was created to encourage home buying. The local developers followed a variety of traditional home designs and they incorporated the latest trends in electrical conveniences into their plans. It was during this time, in 1938, that the fashionable \\"Beaverdale Brick\\" homes, built by local contractor E.T. McMurray, appeared. For the most part, the subdivisions were laid out in basic grid patterns, a convenient standard throughout Midwestern urban development. Two exceptions, Maryland Park and Ashby Manor, are notable for their winding drives and their early attention to design elements that create distinctive and attractive home settings. In 2017, the neighborhood celebrated its centennial, marking 100 years of existence. A 116-foot-long Beaverdale mural was painted on the north wall of Uptempo Music, 2714 Beaver Ave. Areas of interest Beaverdale is 10 minutes from downtown Des Moines, five minutes from Drake University and Varsity Theater, five minutes from Merle Hay Mall, and 10 minutes from Valley West Mall. The Beaverdale Neighborhood Association hosts many events throughout the year. The neighborhood hosts an Easter egg hunt in the spring, a music festival each summer, and a holiday lights contest in the winter. The Beaverdale Fall Festival parade occurs on the third weekend in September. Most of the students who live in this area typically attend either Hoover High School or Roosevelt High School.

It serves the western end of the Longwood Medical Area, the Colleges of the Fenway, and residential areas of Brookline. The station opened with the rest of the line on July 4, 1959. After renovation work completed in 2009, Longwood station is fully handicapped accessible from both Chapel Street and Riverway Park. History =Original stations= Chapel station at an unknown date The Boston and Worcester Railroad opened a branch from Brookline Junction to Brookline on April 10, 1848. There was one intermediate stations on the branch - Longwood just south of Longwood Avenue. The Charles River Branch Railroad extended the Brookline Branch to Newton Upper Falls in November 1852 and to Needham in June 1853, keeping the original B&W; station for its service. The Sears Chapel was built in 1861 and the Church of Our Savior in 1868; sometime that decade Chapel station was opened as a flag stop located at Carlton Street. The Boston and Albany Railroad bought back the line, then part of the New York and New England Railroad, in February 1883. It was double-tracked and extended to the B&A; main at Riverside; \\"Newton Circuit\\" service via the Highland Branch and the main line began on May 16, 1886. =Station consolidation= Sears Chapel and the 1893-built Longwood station shortly after its construction As part of a general improvement program, the railroad replaced many of its original wooden stations with new stone buildings designed by H.H. Richardson and Shepley, Rutan and Coolidge and landscaped by Frederick Law Olmsted. All stations on the Highland Branch save for Longwood, Chapel, and Brookline were thus rebuilt between 1883 and 1894. In April 1892, the B&A; petitioned the Massachusetts Board of Railroad Commissioners to allow them to combine the two old stations into a single new station between their location. The railroad cited the closeness of the two stations, their poor locations, and traffic losses due to the electrified trolley line opened on nearby Beacon Street in 1889. The board referenced the railroad's arguments, the assent of the Brookline selectmen, and an overwhelming majority of residents and passengers in favor of the consolidation when giving their assent. In early 1893, the B&A; commissioned Shepley, Rutan and Coolidge to build new stations at Longwood and Riverside. The new Longwood station was a \\"very simple rectangular design\\" with a dominant stone roof that provided shelter on all four sides. Located on Chapel Street near Hawes Street between the former station locations, it was constructed from July 1893 to May 1894. A footbridge at Carlton Street - one of the only steel bridges in an Olmsted- designed park, though it was designed and built by Brookline's town engineer - was added by the town in mid-1894 to provide access to the Riverway Park. The bridge was closed in 1975 due to severe corrosion. Plans to repair and reopen the footbridge proved locally controversial for a number of years. , construction of the $4 million project is expected to last from 2020 to 2022. =Conversion to trolley service= This wooden shelter replaced the stone station building in 1959 In June 1957, the Massachusetts Legislature approved the purchase of the branch by the M.T.A. from the nearly-bankrupt New York Central Railroad for conversion to a trolley line. Service ended on May 31, 1958. The line was quickly converted for trolley service, and the line including Longwood station reopened on July 4, 1959. The 1893-built station was torn down during the conversion to make room for a small parking lot. The station has two side platforms serving the line's two tracks. =Renovations= During the Brookline Village/Longwood Avenue Station Renovation Project, the MBTA renovated Longwood and Brookline Village stations for handicapped accessibility. The two stations received raised platforms to interface with low-floor trams, wooden ramps to access high-floor trams, and other upgrades. The MBTA originally planned to only offer handicapped access via the Chapel Street entrance to Longwood, but after it became apparent this was not sufficient, ramps were added from Riverway Park as well. Work on both stations began on July 23, 2007. Construction was completed in the second quarter of 2009, making Longwood station a fully handicapped accessible station.

In Christian hamartiology, eternal sins, unforgivable sins, unpardonable sins, or ultimate sins are sins which will not be forgiven by God. One eternal or unforgivable sin (blasphemy against the Holy Spirit) is specified in several passages of the Synoptic Gospels, including , , and . Jewish doctrine Judaism teaches that no sin can overcome God's forgiveness of sins. In Deuteronomy 29:17‚Äì19, it says: Rabbis interpret \\"the Eternal will never forgive such individuals\\" and blasphemy against the Holy Spirit being unforgivable as exaggerations of severity rather than as decrees or condemnations.[https://reformjudaism.org/learning/torah-study/nitzavim- vayeilech/there-unpardonable-sin ReformJudaism: Is There An Unpardonable Sin? Christian doctrine =New Testament passages= Several passages in the New Testament are frequently interpreted as referring to the unforgivable sin: * : \\"Whoever is not with me is against me, and whoever does not gather with me scatters. And so I tell you, any sin and blasphemy can be forgiven. But blasphemy against the Spirit will not be forgiven. Anyone who speaks a word against the Son of Man will be forgiven, but anyone who speaks against the Holy Spirit will not be forgiven, either in this age or in the age to come.\\" * : 28 Verily I say unto you, All sins shall be forgiven unto the sons of men, and blasphemies wherewith soever they shall blaspheme: 29 But he that shall blaspheme against the Holy Ghost hath never forgiveness, but is in danger of eternal damnation. 30 - Because they said, He hath an unclean spirit. * : \\"I tell you, whoever acknowledges me before men, the Son of Man will also acknowledge him before the angels of God. But he who disowns me before men will be disowned before the angels of God. And everyone who speaks a word against the Son of Man will be forgiven, but anyone who blasphemes against the Holy Spirit will not be forgiven.\\" =Eastern Christianity= The importance of prayer (1 Thessalonians : \\"pray without ceasing\\") and humility (Jesus Prayer: \\"Lord Jesus Christ, Son of God, have mercy on me, a sinner\\") in Christianity is reflected by an Orthodox catechism as follows: =Roman Catholicism= The Catechism of the Catholic Church teaches that, while no sin is absolutely \\"unforgivable\\", some sins represent a deliberate refusal to repent and accept the infinite mercy of God; a person committing such a sin refuses God's forgiveness, which can lead to self-condemnation to hell. ¬ß1864 In other words, one damns oneself by final impenitence (refusal to repent), as taught by John Paul II:John Paul II, General Audience of July 28, 1999 > The images of hell that Sacred Scripture presents to us must be correctly > interpreted...hell indicates the state of those who freely and definitively > separate themselves from God...‚ÄúTo die in mortal sin without repenting and > accepting God‚Äôs merciful love means remaining separated from him for ever by > our own free choice. This state of definitive self-exclusion from communion > with God and the blessed is called ‚Äòhell‚Äô‚Äù...‚ÄúEternal damnation‚Äù, therefore, > is not attributed to God's initiative because in his merciful love he can > only desire the salvation of the beings he created. In reality, it is the > creature who closes himself to his love. Damnation consists precisely in > definitive separation from God, freely chosen by the human person and > confirmed with death that seals his choice for ever. God‚Äôs judgement > ratifies this state. The Catholic Encyclopedia cites Matthew 12:22‚Äì32; Mark 3:22‚Äì30; Luke 12:10 (cf. 11:14‚Äì23) and defines \\"the unforgivable sin\\"‚Äîor sin against the Holy Ghost‚Äîas follows: ‚Ä≥... to sin against the Holy Ghost is to confound Him with the spirit of evil, it is to deny, from pure malice, the Divine character of works manifestly Divine.‚Ä≥ The article further states that \\"sin against the Son of Man\\" may be forgiven because it is committed against the human person of Christ, which veils the Divine with a \\"humble and lowly appearance,\\" and therefore such sin is excusable because it is committed through \\"man's ignorance and misunderstanding.\\" The Church Fathers considered additional interpretations, Augustine of Hippo calling it one of the more difficult passages of Scripture. Thomas Aquinas summarized the Church Fathers' treatments and proposed three possible explanations: 1. That an insult directed against any of the Three Divine Persons may be considered a sin against the Holy Spirit; and/or 2. That persisting in mortal sin till death, with final impenitence, as Augustine proposed, frustrates the work of the Holy Spirit, to whom is appropriated the remission of sins; and/or 3. That sins against the quality of the Third Divine Person, being charity and goodness, are conducted in malice, in that they resist the inspirations of the Holy Spirit to turn away from or be delivered from evil. Such sin may be considered graver than those committed against the Father through frailty (the quality of the Father being power), and those committed against the Son through ignorance (the quality of the Son being wisdom). Thomas Aquinas lists, or has responded to, six sins that go against the Holy Spirit:Summa Theologiae. II/II 14 II *despair: which consists in thinking that one's own malice is greater than Divine Goodness, as the Master of the Sentences teaches,Peter Lombard, Sent. ii. D43/2 *presumption: if a man wants to obtain glory without meritsIt must be mentioned in this place that the death-bed prayer of repentance is a meritorious act. or pardon without repentanceRepentance itself need not be perfect repentance, i. e. as long as there is sorrow for the sin from love, or in the Sacrament of Penance fear, of God, and some will however weak to avoid grave sin and its nearest opportunities furtheron, there can be repentance: and it is better to repent from a sin and do it again, waiting maybe for a better time for another completer repentance, than not to repent from it at all until a perfect time in order to certainly never sin afterwards. *resistance to the known truth, *envy of a brother's spiritual good, i.e., of the increase of Divine grace in the world, *impenitence, i.e., the specific purpose of not repenting a sin, *obstinacy, whereby a man, clinging to his sin, becomes immune to the thought that the good searched in it is a very little one. Thomas Aquinas explains that the unforgivability of blasphemy against the Holy Spirit means that it removes the entrance to these means of salvation; however, it cannot hinder God in taking away this obstacle by way of a miracle.S. th. II/II 14 III However, the Church further believes there is no offence, however serious, that cannot be taken away by Baptism, or absolved from in the Confessional‚Äîthat no one, however wicked and guilty, may not confidently hope for forgiveness.(This is also the Lutheran doctrine. See \\"The Defense of the Augsburg Confession,\\" Article XI, Of Confession, paragraph 59, and Article XIII, Of the Number and Use of the Sacraments, paragraphs 4 & 5.) Roman Catechism I, 11, 5. The Catechism says that Christ desires \\"the gates of forgiveness should always be open to anyone who turns away from sin.\\"Cf. Catechism of the Catholic Church, ¬ß 982; cf. Mt 18:21-22 As did St Augustine, the Catholic Church today teaches that only dying unrepentant for one's sins is the only unforgivable sin. Indeed, in Dominum et vivificantem Pope John Paul II writes \\"According to such an exegesis, 'blasphemy' does not properly consist in offending against the Holy Spirit in words; it consists rather in the refusal to accept the salvation which God offers to man through the Holy Spirit, working through the power of the Cross\\", and \\"If Jesus says that blasphemy against the Holy Spirit cannot be forgiven either in this life or in the next, it is because this \\"non-forgiveness\\" is linked, as to its cause, to \\"non-repentance,\\" in other words to the radical refusal to be converted. This means the refusal to come to the sources of Redemption, which nevertheless remain \\"always\\" open in the economy of salvation in which the mission of the Holy Spirit is accomplished.\\" =Protestantism= Protestant denominations and theologians have taken various approaches in defining the sin against the Holy Spirit. John Calvin wrote: Similarly, Jacob Arminius defined it as \\"the rejection and refusing of Jesus Christ through determined malice and hatred against Christ\\". However, Arminius differed with Calvin in believing that the sin could be committed by believers, a conclusion he reached through his interpretation of Hebrews 6:4‚Äì6.Combs, William W (2004). The Blasphemy Against the Holy Spirit Detroit Baptist Seminary Journal 9 (Fall 2004) Some modern Protestant interpretations of the sin include the deliberate labeling of good as evil, as rejecting the conviction of the Holy Spirit, of publicly attributing the work of the Holy Spirit to Satan, and attributing the work of Jesus to Satan (under this interpretation, the sin could only have been committed in the first century AD). For example, The United Methodist Church, which was founded by John Wesley, upholds: A prominent Methodist catechism, \\"A Catechism on the Christian Religion: The Doctrines of Christianity with Special Emphasis on Wesleyan Concepts\\" states: Regardless of their interpretation, Protestant interpreters generally agree that one who has committed the sin is no longer able to repent, so one who is fearful that they have committed it has not done so. =Mormonism= Members of The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints, or Mormons, have a similar understanding of eternal sin. Joseph Smith, the founder of the Latter Day Saint movement, said in the King Follett discourse: Church apostle and later President of the Church, Spencer W. Kimball, stated that \\"the sin against the Holy Ghost requires such knowledge that it is manifestly impossible for the rank and file [of the church] to commit such a sin\\".Edward L. Kimball (ed.), Teachings of Spencer W. Kimball (Bookcraft, Salt Lake City, 1982) p. 23; Spencer W. Kimball, The Miracle of Forgiveness (Bookcraft, Salt Lake City, 1969) p. 123.

Crosswalks across Huntington Avenue to the station are present at Brigham Circle (to the outbound platform), between the two platforms, and at Wigglesworth Street (to the inbound platform). East of Brigham Circle, the E branch runs in a dedicated reservation in the median of Huntington Avenue; west of the circle is street running in mixed traffic to the terminus at Heath Street. Because of this, service is often terminated at Brigham Circle due to traffic conditions to preserve service frequency on the remainder of the line. At these times, the parallel bus provides all service west of Brigham Circle. A facing point crossover is located just east of the station, allowing terminating trains to cross over to the inbound platform.

The college is 11th nationally for the number of doctoral degrees granted and 12th for master's degrees granted. The College is recognized among the top public engineering colleges for its undergraduate and graduate programs. History The first engineering department at Texas A&M; appeared in 1880, four years after the foundation of the school, with the creation of the Department of Engineering, Mechanics, and Drawing. For the next several years, the curriculum focused on practical training to assist students in finding industrial and vocational work. By 1887, separate departments had been created for mechanical engineering and for civil engineering and drawing. To assist the United States during World War I, the Department of Mechanical Engineering shifted focus to train blacksmiths, automobile mechanics, machinists, draftsmen, general mechanics, and pipe fitters for the war. Following the war, the department's enrollment continued to increase, and it began offering courses in power, industrial and railway, or transportation engineering. In the 1930s, these options were eliminated, while others, including aerodynamics, air-conditioning and physical metallurgy began to be offered. During the 1936-1937 school year, the Department of Mechanical Engineering was first accredited by the Engineering Council for Professional Development, now known as the Accreditation Board for Engineering and Technology. By 1940, the engineering school comprised almost half of Texas A&M;'s enrollment. As World War II dawned, the school again assisted the war effort, with the Department of Mechanical Engineering faculty volunteering to teach at military bases throughout the state. Following the war, college introduced a Ph.D. program, and industries and government began to sponsor research within the college. Academics =Degrees offered= Jack E.

He is best known for his witty thrillers that expose the mechanisms of professional politics. He also wrote five novels under the pseudonym Oliver Bleeck about professional go-between Philip St. Ives. Thomas served with the infantry in the Philippines during World War II.Sara Paretsky (preface) in He worked as a public relations specialist, correspondent with the Armed Forces Network, union spokesman, and political strategist in the USA, Bonn (Germany), and Nigeria before becoming a writer. His debut novel, The Cold War Swap, introducing McCorkle and Padillo, was written in only six weeks and won a 1967 Edgar AwardWilliam Heffernan (preface) in for Best First Novel. Briarpatch earned the 1985 Edgar for Best Novel. In 2002 he was honored with the inaugural Gumshoe Lifetime Achievement Award, one of only two authors to earn the award posthumously (the other was 87th Precinct author Ed McBain in 2006). In addition to his novels, Thomas also wrote an original screenplay for producer Robert Evans entitled Jimmy the Rumour. The project is the story of a man born without an identity who works as a thief stealing from other thieves. The first three novels in the McCorkle-Padillo series are written in the first person, as are a number of others through Yellow Dog Contract. The fourth and final McCorkle-Padillo novel has an omniscient narrator, as do all of the other novels published after 1976. All five of the Philip St. Ives stories, however, are told in the first person. Thomas died of lung cancer in Santa Monica, California, two months before his 70th birthday.

The treaty was between the governments of George V of the United Kingdom and Faisal I of Iraq. High Commissioner Francis Humphrys signed for the United Kingdom and Prime Minister Nuri as-Said signed for Iraq. The 1930 treaty was based upon an earlier Anglo-Iraqi Treaty of 1922 but took into account Iraq's increased importance to British interests given new oil finds made in 1927. Background During the Mesopotamian campaign of World War I, armed forces of the United Kingdom, fighting for the Allies, defeated the forces of the Ottoman Empire, fighting for the Central Powers. After the war ended, armed forces of the United Kingdom remained in the area that was to become the Kingdom of Iraq. In 1920, after the Ottoman Empire was partitioned, the United Kingdom formally occupied what was to become Iraq under a mandate from the League of Nations.Lyman, p. 8 The Kingdom of Iraq began with the coronation of King Faisal I on 23 August 1921. The 1930 treaty provided a path towards nominal independence for Iraq two years later at the termination of the mandate and upon the entry of Iraq itself as a member of the League of Nations.Time, 14 July 1930 The main purpose of the treaty was to give the British a variety of commercial and military rights within the country after independence. Critics point out that the treaty was not negotiated but dictated to the British-controlled government to avoid any possibility of real negotiations with a post-independence government. British Prime Minister Winston Churchill was to write that the 1930 treaty provided that the British could maintain air bases near Basra and Habbaniya \\"in times of peace\\" and have the right of transit for military forces and supplies \\"at all times\\". In addition, Churchill indicated that the treaty would provide \\"all possible facilities\\" including the use of railways, rivers, ports, and airways for the passage of armed forces \\"during times of war\\".Churchill, p. 224 The treaty gave the British almost unlimited rights to base military forces in Iraq. It further provided for the unconditional and unlimited right of the British to move troops into or through Iraq. In 1941, the terms of the treaty were used to justify a British invasion and the occupation of Iraq after a nationalist coup whose leaders had contacts among the Axis powers. The British used the terms of the treaty as a basis for an occupation that lasted until end of 1947. As they prepared to depart Iraq, an attempt was made to get the British installed government of Iraq to sign a new military treaty giving the British even more powers than under the 1930 treaty. While that treaty was approved, it never came into effect because of unrest and large demonstrations in Iraq against it. Critics consider the treaty a document nothing more than a cover for the British to permanently limit the independence of Iraq and to give the British a right to intervene in the internal affairs of Iraq as they pleased. The treaties always revolved around protecting the access to Iraqi oil resources by British companies by giving the British the right of military intervention in the country.

His MAJESTY THE KING OF GREAT BRITAIN, IRELAND AND THE BRITISH DOMINIONS BEYOND THE SEAS, EMPEROR OF INDIA, and His MAJESTY THE KING OF 'IRAQ, whereas they desire to consolidate the friendship and to maintain and perpetuate the relations of good understanding between their respective countries; and Whereas His Britannic Majesty undertook in the Treaty of Alliance signed at Baghdad on the thirteenth day of January, One thousand nine hundred and twenty-six of the Christian Era, corresponding to the twenty-eighth day of Jamadi-al-Ukhra, One thousand three hundred and forty-four, Hijrah, that he would take into active consideration at successive intervals of four years the question whether it was possible for him to press for the admission of 'Iraq into the League of Nations; and Whereas His Majesty's Government in the United Kingdom of Great Britain and Northern Ireland informed the 'Iraq Government without qualification or proviso on the fourteenth day of September, One thousand nine hundred and twenty-nine that they were prepared to support the candidature of 'Iraq for admission to the League of Nations in the year One thousand nine hundred and thirty-two and announced to the Council of the League on the fourth day of November, One thousand nine hundred and twenty-nine, that this was their intention; and Whereas the mandatory responsibilities accepted by His Britannic Majesty in respect of 'Iraq will automatically terminate upon the admission of 'Iraq to the League of Nations; and Whereas His Britannic Majesty and His Majesty the King of 'Iraq consider that the relations which will subsist between them as independent sovereigns should be defined by the conclusion of a Treaty of Alliance and Amity: Have agreed to conclude a new Treaty for this purpose on terms of complete freedom, equality and independence which will become operative upon the entry of 'Iraq into the League of Nations, and have appointed as their Plenipotentiaries: His MAJESTY THE KING OF GREAT BRITAIN, IRELAND, AND THE BRITISH DOMINIONS BEYOND THE SEAS, EMPEROR OF INDIA, FOR GREAT BRITAIN AND NORTHERN IRELAND: Lieutenant-Colonel Sir Francis Henry HUMPHRYS, Knight Grand Cross of the Royal Victorian Order, Knight Commander of the Most Distinguished Order of Saint Michael and Saint George, Knight Commander of the Most Excellent Order of the British Empire, Companion of the Most Eminent Order of the Indian Empire, High Commissioner of His Britannic Majesty in 'Iraq; and His MAJESTY THE KING OF 'IRAQ: General Nuri Pasha al SA'ID, Order of the Nadha, Second Class, Order of the Istiqlal, Second Class, Companion of the Most Distinguished Order of Saint Michael and Saint George, Companion of the Distinguished Service Order, Prime Minister of the 'Iraq Government and Minister for Foreign Affairs; Who having communicated their full powers, found in due form, have agreed as follows: =Article 1.= There shall be perpetual peace and friendship between His Britannic Majesty and His Majesty the King of 'Iraq. There shall be established between the High Contracting Parties a close alliance in consecration of their friendship, their cordial understanding and their good relations, and there shall be full and frank consultation between them in all matters of foreign policy which may affect their common interests. Each of the High Contracting Parties undertakes not to adopt in foreign countries an attitude which is inconsistent with the alliance or might create difficulties for the other party thereto. =Article 2.= Each High Contracting Party will be represented at the Court of the other High Contracting Party by a diplomatic representative duly accredited. =Article 3.= Should any dispute between 'Iraq and a third State produce a situation which involves the risk of a rupture with that State, the High Contracting Parties will concert together with a view to the settlement of the said dispute by peaceful means in accordance with the provisions of the Covenant of the League of Nations and of any other international obligation which may be applicable to the case. =Article 4.= Should, notwithstanding the provisions of Article 3 above, either of the High Contracting Parties become engaged in war, the other High Contracting Party will, subject always to the provisions of Article 9 below, immediately come to his aid in the capacity of an ally. In the event of an imminent menace of war the High Contracting Parties will immediately concert together the necessary measures of defence. The aid of His Majesty the King of 'Iraq in the event of war or the imminent menace of war will consist in furnishing to His Britannic Majesty on 'Iraq territory all facilities and assistance in his power including the use of railways, rivers, ports, aerodromes and means of communication. =Article 5.= It is understood between the High Contracting Parties that responsibility for the maintenance of internal order in 'Iraq and, subject to the provisions of Article 4 above, for the defence of 'Iraq from external aggression rests with His Majesty the King of 'Iraq. Nevertheless, His Majesty the King of 'Iraq recognises that the permanent maintenance and protection in all circumstances of the essential communications of His Britannic Majesty is in the common interest of the High Contracting Parties. For this purpose and in order to facilitate the discharge of the obligations of His Britanic Majesty under Article 4 above His Majesty the King of 'Iraq undertakes to grant to His Britannic Majesty for the duration of the Alliance sites for air bases to be selected by His Britannic Majesty at or in the vicinity of Basra and for an air base to be selected by His Britannic Majesty to the west of the Euphrates. His Majesty the King of 'Iraq further authorises His Britannic Majesty to maintain forces upon 'Iraq territory at the above localities in accordance with the provisions of the Annexure of this Treaty on the understanding that the presence of those forces shall not constitute in any manner an occupation and will in no way prejudice the sovereign rights of 'Iraq. =Article 6.= The Annexure hereto shall be regarded as an integral part of the present Treaty. =Article 7.= This Treaty shall replace the Treaties of Alliance signed at Baghdad on the tenth day of October, One thousand nine hundred and twenty-two of the Christian Era 1, corresponding to the nineteenth day of Safar, One thousand three hundred and forty-one, Hijrah, and on the thirteenth day of January, One thousand nine hundred and twenty- six, of the Christian Era 2, corresponding to the twenty-eighth day of Jamadi- al-Ukhra, One thousand three hundred and forty-four, Hijrah, and the subsidiary agreements thereto, which shall cease to have effect upon the entry into force of this Treaty. It shall be executed in duplicate, in the English and Arabic languages, of which the former shall be regarded as the authoritative version. =Article 8.= The High Contracting Parties recognise that, upon the entry into force of this Treaty, all responsibilities devolving under the Treaties and Agreements referred to in Article 7 hereof upon His Britannic Majesty in respect of 'Iraq will, in so far as His Britannic Majesty is concerned, then automatically and completely come to an end, and that such responsibilities, in so far as they continue at all, will devolve upon His Majesty the King of 'Iraq alone. It is also recognised that all responsibilities devolving upon His Britannic Majesty in respect of 'Iraq under any other international instrument, in so far as they continue at all, should similarly devolve upon His Majesty the King of 'Iraq alone, and the High Contracting Parties shall immediately take such steps as may be necessary to secure the transference to His Majesty the King of 'Iraq of these responsibilities. =Article 9.= Nothing in the present Treaty is intended to or shall in any way prejudice the rights and obligations which devolve, or may devolve, upon either of the High Contracting Parties under the Covenant of the League of Nations or the Treaty for the Renunciation of War signed at Paris on the twenty-seventh day of August, One thousand nine hundred and twenty-eight. =Article 10.= Should any difference arise relative to the application or the interpretation of this Treaty and should the High Contracting Parties fail to settle such difference by direct negotiation, then it shall be dealt with in accordance with the provisions of the Covenant of the League of Nations. =Article 11.= This Treaty shall be ratified and ratifications shall be exchanged as soon as possible. Thereafter it shall come into force as soon as 'Iraq has been admitted to membership of the League of Nations. The present Treaty shall remain in force for a period of twenty-five years from the date of its coming into force. At any time after twenty years from the date of the coming into force of this Treaty, the High Contracting Parties will, at the request of either of them, conclude a new Treaty which shall provide for the continued maintenance and protection in all circumstances of the essential communications of His Britannic Majesty. In case of disagreement in this matter the difference will be submitted to the Council of the League of Nations. In faith whereof the respective Plenipotentiaries have signed the present Treaty and have affixed thereto their seals. Done at Baghdad in duplicate this thirtieth day of June, One thousand nine hundred and thirty, of the Christian Era, corresponding to the fourth day of Safar, One thousand three hundred and forty-nine, Hijrah.

His Britannic Majesty shall maintain forces at Hinaidi for a period of five years after the entry into force of this Treaty in order to enable His Majesty the King of 'Iraq to organise the necessary forces to replace them. By the expiration of that period the said forces of His Britannic Majesty shall have been withdrawn from Hinaidi. It shall be also open to His Britannic Majesty to maintain forces at Mosul for a maximum period of five years from the entry into force of this Treaty. Thereafter it shall be open to His Britannic Majesty to station his forces in the localities mentioned in Article 5 of this Treaty, and His Majesty the King of 'Iraq will grant to His Britannic Majesty for the duration of the Alliance leases of the necessary sites for the accommodation of the forces of His Britannic Majesty in those localities.

The 'Iraq Government will take the necessary steps to ensure that the altered conditions will not render the position of the British forces as regards immunities and privileges in any way less favourable than that enjoyed by them at the date of the entry into force of this Treaty.  Clause 3.  His Majesty the King of 'Iraq agrees to provide all possible facilities for the movement, training and maintenance of the forces referred to in Clause 1 above and to accord to those forces the same facilities for the use of wireless telegraphy as those enjoyed by them at the date of the entry into force of the present Treaty.

He further undertakes that any personnel of his forces that may be sent abroad for military training will be sent to military schools, colleges and training centres in the territories of His Britannic Majesty, provided that this shall not prevent him from sending to any other country such personnel as cannot be received in the said institutions and training centres. He further undertakes that the armament and essential equipment of his forces shall not differ in type from those of the forces of His Britannic Majesty.  Clause 7.  His Majesty the King of 'Iraq agrees to afford, when requested to do so by His Britannic Majesty, all possible facilities for the movement of the forces of His Britannic Majesty of all arms in transit across 'Iraq and for the transport and storage of all supplies and equipment that may be required by these forces during their passage across 'Iraq.

Robinson, Jr. Secondary School is a six-year public school in the Commonwealth of Virginia, in the United States. Known as Robinson Secondary School, it is located in Fairfax County, a suburb southwest of Washington, D.C. Opened in 1971, Robinson is located south of Braddock Road near George Mason University, and is administered by the Fairfax County Public Schools. It offers the International Baccalaureate program, and has approximately 3,900 students in grades 7‚Äì12. Robinson's school colors are royal blue and gold, and the school mascot is a ram. History Robinson was named after Medal of Honor recipient James W. Robinson, Jr., the first resident of Virginia to be awarded the medal during the Vietnam War. Sergeant Robinson, age 25, was fatally wounded under heroic circumstances in South Vietnam in April 1966, while serving in the infantry in the U.S. Army. Robinson Secondary School The school opened its doors in September 1971, taking its students from Fairfax, W.T. Woodson, Oakton, and West Springfield high schools. It was the second of Fairfax County's \\"secondary schools,\\" or \\"superschools,\\" which housed grades 7‚Äì12. Lake Braddock, which opened two years later in 1973, was the third of these schools from this era. The first was Hayfield, near Mount Vernon, which opened in 1968, and the most recent is South County in Lorton, which opened in 2005, taking its students from former Hayfield territory. South County has since reverted to high school status with the opening of South County Middle School near the school's athletic gym. Awards and recognitions Robinson won the 2018‚Äì19 Wells Fargo Cup race, which is presented annually to Virginia public high schools that have \\"demonstrated extraordinary success in academic activities throughout the year\\". This is the first time Robinson has won the Wells Fargo Cup for Academics. Demographics For the 2018‚Äì19 school year, Robinson's grade 9‚Äì12 student body was 59.05% White, 13.69% Asian, 14.66% Hispanic, 5.89% Black and 6.71% other races. The grade 7‚Äì8 student body was 57.46% White, 13.27% Asian, 14.92% Hispanic, 6.68% Black and 7.67% other races. Athletics LSD scandal In 1991, Robinson was the center of an LSD trafficking scandal in which a drug ring sold more than 100,000 doses of LSD over two years. The ring was exposed when a 16-year-old Robinson student shot and wounded a Fairfax police officer. In the course of the investigation it was revealed that six Robinson and Lake Braddock graduates were receiving large quantities of the drug through the mail. One of the men who was facing the harshest penalties faked suicide and fled the area, only to be caught two years later in St. Louis and sentenced to 24 years in prison with no possibility of parole.

Early life and education Price was born in The Bronx in New York City, the son of Samuel and Bella Price, Jewish immigrants to the United States from Minsk (Belarus), in the early years of the 20th century.Washington Post: \\"Price Club changed America's shopping experience\\" By Peter Eisner December 15, 2009 The family relocated to San Diego in the early 1920s. Price graduated from San Diego High School in 1931, attended San Diego State University in 1932, and earned his undergraduate degree (in philosophy) and a law degree from the University of Southern California in 1936 and 1938, respectively. By 1938, he had married his girlfriend Helen Moskowitz; they eloped to Las Vegas. Price was admitted to the California Bar in November 1938. Career Price launched the first FedMart in 1954 and, together with his son, Robert, Giles Bateman, a nephew, Rick Libenson and others, founded Price Club in 1976. The company went public in 1980. In 1993 Costco merged with Price Club to form PriceCostco. Leadership in the new organization was shared between Sol Price's son, Robert, and James Sinegal. After eight months, PriceCostco spun a separate company called Price Enterprises,https://shop.pricesmart.com/ led by the younger Price. PriceSmart continues to operate warehouse clubs in Latin America and the Caribbean, while the domestic operations became Costco.Jeffrey Covell (2000) \\"PriceSmart, Inc.\\", International Directory of Company Histories, vol. 71 Sam Walton of Walmart wrote in his book Made in America that he \\"borrowed\\" \\"as many ideas from Sol Price as from anybody else in the business\\". He added that he especially liked the idea of calling his discount chain \\"Wal-Mart\\" because he \\"really liked Sol's FedMart name\\". In 1983, Walton dined with Price and later that year the first Sam's Club opened in Oklahoma City, Oklahoma. Later when asked how it felt to be the father of an industry (the warehouse retail industry‚ÄîCostco, Sam's Club, etc.) Sol replied, \\"I wish I'd worn a condom.\\" Costco's longest-serving CEO, Sinegal, learned the retail business largely through working his way up FedMart's corporate ladder. In CNBC's 2012 documentary on Costco, Sinegal indicated that Price had been his mentor, as well as the person who taught him to be \\"tough\\" in business, and to display a sense of \\"social responsibility\\" toward employees. Philanthropy In the late 1980s, Price donated $2 million to the construction of a new student center on the campus of University of California, San Diego. Named for Price, the Price Center, which houses the main student bookstore, food court, movie theater, ballrooms, and meeting rooms, opened on April 21, 1989. In 2011, the Price Family Charitable Fund donated $50 million to the University of Southern California's School of Policy, Planning, and Development. The school was renamed the USC Sol Price School of Public Policy as a result of the donation. Price is responsible for injecting money and aiding the renaissance of the San Diego mid-city neighborhood of City Heights, near his childhood home. He was a member of the Board of Trustees for the Urban Institute in Washington, D.C., the Board of Directors for the Center on Budget and Policy Priorities, the Consumer Affairs Advisory Committee of the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission, and the San Diego Financial Review Panel.

He studied under Fr√©d√©ric Chopin for piano (later becoming his teaching assistant) and Anton Reicha for composition. He toured widely as a concert pianist, becoming Director of the Lviv Conservatory in 1858. He founded his own school there in 1888.Grove's Dictionary of Music and Musicians, 5th ed, 1954 He died in Lemberg, then part of Austrian Poland (now Lviv, Ukraine) and is buried in Lychakiv Cemetery in Lviv.  Editions  He is most well known as an editor of works by Chopin. Dover Publications currently publishes reprints of his 1879 editions of Chopin's piano music, originally published by F. Kistner (Leipzig). His goal, as stated in the foreword of the edition, was to provide more reliable editions. He used several verified sources, most of which were written or corrected by Chopin himself. His editions of Chopin's works were first published in America in 1895. Mikuli also took detailed notes of Chopin's comments made in lessons and interviewed witnesses of Chopin's performances. For many years he was regarded as the primary authority on Chopin and his remarks about Chopin's playing were often quoted by biographers.

Its main objective is to counsel physicians on the best possible and acceptable way to diagnose and treat certain diseases or how to address a particular decision-making area. It is usually, therefore, considered an authoritative, community-based expression of a consensus decision-making and publication process. Methods There are many ways of producing medical consensus, but the most usual way is to convene an independent panel of experts, either by a medical association or by a governmental authority. Since consensus statements provide a \\"snapshot in time\\" of the state of knowledge in a particular topic, they must periodically be re-evaluated and published again, replacing the previous consensus statement. Consensus statements differ from medical guidelines, another form of state-of-the-science public statements. According to the NIH, \\"Consensus statements synthesize new information, largely from recent or ongoing medical research, that has implications for reevaluation of routine medical practices. They do not give specific algorithms or guidelines for practice.\\"  History  From 1977 to 2013, the National Institutes of Health (United States) promoted about five to six consensus panels per year, and organized this knowledge by means of a special Consensus Development Program, managed by the NIH's Office of Disease Prevention (ODP). It was retired in 2013 in deference to other agencies and organizations that had picked up the lead, such as the U.S. Preventive Services Task Force, the Community Preventive Services Task Force, Institute of Medicine, and Cochrane. Its archive is available in printed form as well as for downloading from the Internet.

In the 1970s, light organs were a popular lighting effect used in discotheques and dance parties; and also during that period, the home entertainment manufacturer Morse-Electrophonic produced some of their stereo systems with a built-in light organ display (such as their \\"Stereo Bar\\"). The multicolored lights of the light organ would pulsate to the beat of the music. Technology The circuit of a light organ separates the audio signal into frequency bands and controls the light channels according to the average level of each band using dimmers. A typical party light organ of the 1970s had three spotlights, red, green and blue, for sounds in bass, medium frequency and high frequency. Due to their simple structure, light organs were popular as DIY projects for electronics hobbyists in the 1970s and can still be found for sale on the internet. In 1971, the Rickenbacker guitar company offered their 331LS \\"Lightshow\\" model (and matching bass, model 4005LS), the body of which contained a three-channel light organ (with a dimmer); each channel corresponded to the pitch of the strings being played. The soundboard on these models was replaced with thin Plexiglas cutouts over a translucent moire diffraction material.http://rickbeat.com/modelslibrary/331ls/331ls.htmhttp://rickbeat.com/modelslibrary/4005ls/4005ls.htm With the widespread adoption of cheap PCs, some hobbyists started experimenting with using PCs for frequency analysis instead of analog filters.

She served in the Confederate Navy first as Florida, and later as Selma. She was captured by the Union Navy steamer USS Metacomet during the Battle of Mobile Bay. She served as USS Selma until the end of the war, when she was decommissioned and sold for use as a merchant ship.  Construction and conversion  Selma was built as the coastwise packet Florida at Mobile, Alabama in 1856 for the Mobile Mail Line. She was inspected and accepted by Captain Lawrence Rousseau, CSN, on April 22, 1861, acquired by the Confederacy in June, cut down and strengthened by hog frames and armed as a gunboat ‚Äî all, apparently, in the Lake Pontchartrain area. Her upper deck was plated at this time with ‚Öú inch iron, partially protecting her boilers, of the low pressure type preferred for fuel economy and greater safety in battle. CSS Florida is cited on November 12, 1861 as already in commission and serving Commodore G. N. Rollins' New Orleans defense flotilla under command of Lieutenant Charles W. Hays, CSN. The Mobile Evening News editorialized early in December on the startling change \\"from her former gay, first-class hotel appearance, having been relieved of her upper works and painted as black as the inside of her smokestack. She carries a jib forward and, we suppose, some steering sail aft, when requisite.\\" Service as Florida Although much of Florida's time was spent blockaded in Mobile, she made some forays into Mississippi Sound, two of which alarmed the United States Navy's entire Gulf command. On October 19, Florida convoyed a merchantman outside. Fortunately for her, the coast was clear of Union ships and batteries, for Florida fouled the area's main military telegraph line with her anchor, and had no sooner repaired the damage than she went aground for 36 hours. Luck returning, she tried out her guns on , \\"a large three-masted propeller\\" she mistook for the faster . Being of shallower draft and greater speed, she successfully dodged Massachusetts in shoal water off Ship Island. The havoc caused by one well- placed shot with her rifled pivot gun is described by Commander Melancton Smith, USN, commanding Massachusetts; > It entered the starboard side abaft the engine five feet above the water > line, cutting entirely through 18 planks of the main deck, carried away the > table, sofas, eight sections of iron steam pipe, and exploded in the > stateroom on the port side, stripping the bulkheads of four rooms, and > setting fire to the vessel ... 12 pieces of the fragments have been > collected and weigh 58 pounds. The first sortie by Florida caused consternation. Captain L. M. Powell, USN, in command at Ship Island ‚Äî soon to be main advance base for the New Orleans campaign ‚Äî wrote to Flag Officer William McKean, October 22; > The first of the reported gun steamers made her experimental trial trip on > the Massachusetts, and, if she be a sample of the rest, you may perhaps > consider that Ship Island and the adjacent waters will require a force of a > special kind in order to hold them to our use. The caliber and long range of > the rifled cannon from which the shell that exploded in the Massachusetts > was fired established the ability of these fast steam gunboats to keep out > of the range of all broadside guns, and enables them to disregard the > armament or magnitude of all ships thus armed, or indeed any number of them, > when sheltered by shoal water. Protecting CSS Pamilico, in contrasting white dress and laden with some 400 troops, \\"the black rebel steamer\\" Florida on December 4 had a brush with in Horn Island Pass that caused jubilation in the Southern press. Commander T. Darrah Shaw of Montgomery, finding his 10-inch shell gun no match for Florida's long-range rifles, signaled Commander Melancton Smith for assistance, and when it was not forthcoming, ran back to safety under the guns of Ship Island. Shaw saved Montgomery and lost his command for fleeing from the enemy. Commodore McKean promptly sent Lieutenant James Edward Jouett to relieve him and forwarded Shaw's action report to United States Secretary of the Navy Gideon Welles, noting, \\"It needs no comment.\\" Crowed Richmond Dispatch on December 14, quoting Mobile Evening News, \\"The Florida fought at great disadvantage in one respect, owing to her steering apparatus being out of order, but showed a decided superiority in the effectiveness of her armament. That gun which scared the Massachusetts so badly, and had nearly proved fatal to her, is evidently a better piece or must be better handled than any which the enemy have.\\" Service as Selma With the advent of cruiser CSS Florida, she was renamed Selma in July 1862, Lieutenant Peter U. Murphey, CSN, assuming command. On February 5, 1863, while steaming down Mobile Bay with 100 extra men in search of a blockader to carry by boarding, Selma was bilged by a snag in crossing Dog River Bar, entrance to Mobile, and sank in 8 feet of water. Pumped out hastily, she was back in service February 13. By the following year, Selma, CSS Morgan and CSS Gaines, the only ships capable of defending lower Mobile Bay, were having a serious problem with deserting seamen, and intelligence reported Selma's crew as having fallen as low as 15 men about mid-February. Selma is captured by Metacomet At the crucial Battle of Mobile Bay, the largest naval engagement of the Civil War on August 5, 1864, Selma, captained by Lt. Peter Umstead \\"Capt. Pat\\" Murphey, was one of three small Confederate gunboats present. She particularly annoyed Rear Admiral David Farragut, USN by a steady, raking fire as she stood off 's bow. After passing the forts, Farragut ordered gunboat , captained by James Jouett, cast loose from Hartford to pursue Selma. After an hour-long running fight, Murphey, unable to escape to shallow water, had to surrender to the faster, more heavily armed Metacomet. Selma lost 7 killed and 8 wounded, including Murphey, who suffered an injured arm. The Selma was last Confederate ship to surrender at the Battle of Mobile Bay. That evening, Admiral Farragut commissioned the prize gunboat as USS Selma and placed her under the command of Arthur R. Yates, USN. Five days later, Selma joined in the Union Navy's bombardment of Fort Morgan. On August 16, she participated in a reconnaissance expedition up the Dog River. In January 1865, Selma was transferred to New Orleans where she served until decommissioned on July 16, 1865. Sold at auction the same day to G. A. Hall, Selma was redocumented for merchant service on August 17, 1865 and foundered on June 24, 1868 south of Galveston, Texas, off the mouth of the Brazos River.

Reynolds Tobacco. It heats the tobacco instead of burning it by using a carbon tip wrapped in glass fibers. In 2014 they were still in production, and one of the remaining choices allowed to be smoked in the offices of R.J. Reynolds facilities after the company began to restrict traditional smoking in their office facilities. They were retested in Wisconsin as \\"Revo\\" in 2015. History Eclipse Menthol carton and pack, photographed in 2018 Revo is essentially the same as Eclipse, but with a different appearance. It primarily heated tobacco instead of burning it. The price was close to a premium pack of traditional cigarettes. Eclipse continues to be available in limited supply, as of 2014. In July 2015 the CEO of Reynolds said they \\"planned to discontinue its heat-not-burn cigarette Revo, which it began testing in Wisconsin in February. She said consumer adoption rates failed to meet expectations.\\" Safety The American Cancer Society argues that the cigarettes are not as safe as the marketing campaign suggests, and that they should be removed from the marketplace: although they produce less tar and produce less second-hand smoke, this leads to a false sense of security, since the cigarette still contains high amounts of carcinogens. Other concerns are that they produce more carbon monoxide than regular cigarettes. R. J. Reynolds has countered by claiming that the company is not trying to market a \\"safe\\" cigarette, only a better alternative.

is a fictional kleptomaniac dwarf from the Artemis Fowl series by Irish fiction author Eoin Colfer. He has been arrested numerous times by the LEP due to his criminal nature; stealing from Mud Men is his speciality. An expert burglar, he is also infamous for his powerful and deadly flatulence, varieties including, the \\"torpedo\\", and the \\"cyclone\\". As a dwarf, he can tunnel underground using his unhinged jaws at high speeds. He even has his own tools to work in his kleptomaniac favour. His beard hair act as antennae and he can pick up vibrations through walls and underground. Also, when they are pulled, they stiffen and form to work as keys and other useful items. When his spit dries it becomes rock solid and glows in the dark. It also contains a sedative. His dwarf rock polish is used to melt glass and metal. A side effect of his flatulence is the buildup of Methanobrevibacter smithii archaea, which prevents aeroembolism. (In reality, the methanobrevibacter smithii is an archaeon found in human guts which helps decompose refined sugars.) A running joke in the series is that he smells horrible. Aliases Mulch Diggums has used various aliases in the Artemis Fowl series, including Lance Digger, Mo Digence, The Grouch, Tombstone and likely various others in his three hundred year \\"career\\" as a thief. Role in the series =Artemis Fowl= In the first book, Artemis Fowl, he is blackmailed by the Lower Elements Police (LEP) to assist in the siege of Fowl Manor.Artemis Fowl He is able to infiltrate the manor by burrowing under the wine cellar and gives Domovoi Butler, Artemis' accomplice, quite a surprise. He finds out that Artemis's secret weapon is a copy of the Book of the People. He fakes his death in a cave-in as a bid for freedom, and steals bars of gold from the Lower Elements Police Holly Short (the elf captured by Artemis Fowl) ransom fund before tunnelling away. =The Seventh Dwarf= Mulch was lured by Artemis Fowl to steal the priceless Fei Fei tiara which contains an enormous blue diamond. However, a group of six dwarves led by Sergei the Significant have already stolen the tiara and plan to sell it at a circus to several European jewellery fences. As the dwarves perform in the circus, Mulch sneaks in underground and takes the tiara, also knocking out their leader, Sergei. =The Arctic Incident= In Artemis Fowl and the Arctic Incident, he has used the gold he stole in the first book to buy himself a fancy apartment in Los Angeles, under the alias Lance Digger.Artemis Fowl: The Arctic Incident He quickly returns to his old ways, and becomes a thief known as \\"The Grouch\\", famous for stealing one of every Academy Award trophy. After being found by Artemis and Holly Short, he helps them break into Opal Koboi's laboratories, in exchange for a two-day head start, which he takes as soon as the mission is over. =The Eternity Code= In Artemis Fowl and the Eternity Code, he is initially working for the Antonelli family as a \\"monkey\\" (which means someone who is good at breaking into places) under the alias Mo Digence, but foils a plot to kidnap Artemis, and subsequently assists him in breaking into the Spiro Needle to steal back the C Cube. After this, Artemis Fowl helps him by changing the date on his original search warrant, rendering all further convictions void. Artemis gives him a gold medallion which is actually a computer disc with information to help Artemis recover his memories after the mind wipe. =The Opal Deception= In the fourth book, Artemis Fowl and the Opal Deception, he is en route to his hearings when he hears of Commander Root's death and escapes from and steals a LEPrecon shuttle, knowing that Holly couldn't have committed the murder and regarding Root as a 'sort of' friend (He is spared from Koboi's revenge as the LEP didn't advertise his involvement in her defeat to save face). He delivers the disc Artemis gave him to Butler, Artemis' bodyguard, restoring Butler's memory and allowing the two of them to come up with a plan to rescue Artemis and Holly Short from Opal Koboi, in the Eleven Wonders Exhibition in the Lower Elements which was full of trolls.Artemis Fowl and the Opal Deception Mulch joins forces with Holly Short, Artemis Fowl, and Domovoi Butler. Mulch sneaks aboard Opal's vehicle and moves the shaped charges to the \\"booty box.\\" He also steals all of Koboi's precious truffles along with one of her diamond earrings. =The Lost Colony= In Artemis Fowl and the Lost Colony, Mulch, now a PI (private investigator), is needed by Artemis Fowl to foil a plan to expose the missing demon race. He helps them break into the Paradizo chateau, rescue Minerva Paradizo from the clutches of Billy Kong and while Holly is away in Limbo, he runs the PI firm with another ex-criminal partner, Doodah Day.Artemis Fowl and the Lost Colony =The Time Paradox= While Artemis and Holly are trapped in the past, a \\"younger\\" Mulch rescues them from Artemis' younger self. He then agrees to accompany them to save the silky sifaka lemur for a stupendous amount of gold.Artemis Fowl and the Time Paradox The three friends are able to successfully capture the lemur by having Mulch tunnel underneath it and steal it away from Dr Kronksi, but Holly is kidnapped by the younger Artemis. Mulch stays with the lemur until Artemis rescues her, and they return to Fowl Manor. He is accosted by Opal Koboi who drains his memories from the past three days to find Artemis and Holly, and doesn't remember the experience, or his shoe size. =The Last Guardian= Mulch Diggums played a pivotal role in saving Artemis's life several times, ultimately ruining Opal Koboi's plan. He also displayed his ability to ride a troll.

He is widely regarded as a pioneer in the science of tropical cyclone forecasting and one of the world's leading experts on tropical storms.http://www.westword.com/2006-06-29/news/the-skeptic/full After retiring as a faculty member at CSU in 2005, Gray remained actively involved in both climate change and tropical cyclone research until his death. Early life and career Gray was born on 9 October 1929, in Detroit, Michigan, and was the eldest son of Ulysses S. Gray and Beatrice Mason Gray. His family moved to Washington, D.C. in 1939 where he graduated from Wilson High School. In 1952, Gray received a B.S. degree in geography from George Washington University before joining the United States Air Force in 1953. Over the next four years, he served as an overseas weather forecast officer, primarily stationed in the Azores and England. Upon returning to the United States in 1957, he began work as a research assistant at the University of Chicago Department of Meteorology from 1957 to 1961. During his time there, he earned a M.S. in meteorology 1959 and went on to earn a PhD in geophysical sciences in 1964 under the mentorship of Herbert Riehl. He joined Colorado State University (CSU) in 1961 as part of the Department of Atmospheric Science. Gray remained active in the Air Force Reserves until 1974, at which time he retired as a Lieutenant colonel. Following his retirement from the Reserves, he became a professor at CSU and went on to advise successful 20 PhD and 50 M.S. graduates. Eight of his students received awards from the American Meteorological Society while under his mentorship. Many of his students went on to become prominent members of the meteorological community, with several working at the National Hurricane Center. His last student was Philip Klotzbach, who later took over Gray's position as lead author of the CSU seasonal hurricane forecasts. Gray worked closely with the World Meteorological Organization throughout his career. Starting in 1978, he traveled to numerous countries establish or improve connections with meteorologists across the globe, a groundbreaking action. In 1985, he organized the first International Workshop on Tropical Cyclones in Bangkok, Thailand. Gray had many students and he offered them advice including his commandments. One of them was Remember Up-Moist, Down-Dry and Keep it Holy which was the reference to his conviction that one has to include moisture processes such as evaporation and rainfall to understand atmospheric energy balance. Thou Shalt Not Concern Thyself Unduly With Commandments and Regulations expressed his disdain for bureaucracy. Being an observational atmospheric scientist, he detested numerical models of the atmosphere - Thou Shalt Not Bow Before Computer Terminals Nor Involve Thyself With Numerical Models. He held very lively group meetings with his students and encouraged them to question everything - Remember Thy Project Meeting and Keep it Holy, Thou Shalt Not Wait'til the End of a Talk to Ask a Question When Thou Can Interrupt in the Middle. Personal life On 1 October 1954, Gray married Nancy Price and they had four children together: Sarah, Anne (deceased), Janet, and Robert. They remained married until Price's death in 2001. Gray was an avid fan of baseball and followed the then Washington Senators (now known as the Texas Rangers). He initially sought a career in baseball or basketball but a knee injury at age 21 prevented him from pursuing such. Research Among Gray's most prominent achievements were the establishment of seasonal hurricane forecasts and finding that hurricane activity is cyclical. He is widely regarded as a pioneer in hurricane research, particularly for the seasonal forecasts. Throughout his career, Gray published more than 80 papers and 60 research reports. Klotzbach referred to him as \\"one of the greatest minds in hurricane research\\". =Seasonal hurricane forecasts= In the late 1970s, Gray noticed a trend of low hurricane activity in the North Atlantic basin during El Ni√±o years. He was the first researcher to make a connection between such events and positive results led him to pursue further research. He found numerous factors across the globe influence tropical cyclone activity, such as connecting wet periods over the African Sahel to an increase in major hurricane landfalls along the United States East Coast. However, his findings also showed inconsistencies when only looking at a single factor as a primary influence. Utilizing his findings, Gray developed an objective, statistical forecast for seasonal hurricane activity; he predicted only the number of tropical storms, hurricanes, and major hurricanes, foregoing specifics on tracks and potential landfalls due to the aforementioned inconsistencies. Gray issued his first seasonal forecast ahead of the 1984 season, which used the statistical relationships between tropical cyclone activity, the El Ni√±o‚ÄìSouthern Oscillation (ENSO), Quasi-biennial oscillation (QBO), and Caribbean basin sea-level pressures.http://tropical.atmos.colostate.edu/Includes/Documents/Publications/camargoetal2007.pdf The endeavor proved modestly successful. He subsequently issued forecasts ahead of the start of the Atlantic hurricane season in May and before the peak of the season in August. Students and colleagues joined his forecast team in the following years, including Christopher Landsea, Paul W. Mielke Jr., and Kenneth J. Berry. After the 2005 Atlantic hurricane season, Gray announced that he was stepping back from the primary authorship of CSU's tropical cyclone probability forecasts, passing the role to Philip J. Klotzbach. Gray indicated that he would be devoting more time to the issue of global warming. He did not attribute global warming to anthropogenic causes, and was critical of those who did.Hurricane Expert: School Silencing Me Over Global-Warming Views =Climate change= Following Gray's retirement from CSU's faculty, he became a controversial figure in the discussion on climate change, particularly his stance against anthropogenic global warming. Gray was skeptical of current theories of human-induced global warming, which he said are supported by scientists afraid of losing grant funding and promoted by government leaders and environmentalists seeking world government. Although he agreed that global warming was taking place, he argued that humans were only responsible for a tiny portion and it was largely part of the Earth's natural cycle. In June 2011, Gray wrote a paper directed at the American Meteorological Society, criticizing their advocation of anthropogenic global warming. He said that members were following a political agenda rather than a scientific one as well as working for special interests rather than the scientific community at large. Peter Webster, a Georgia Institute of Technology professor, was part of the anonymous peer review on several of Gray's National Science Foundation proposals. In every case he has turned down the global warming research component because he believed it was not up to standards, but recommended that Gray's hurricane research be funded. Webster, who has co-authored other scientific papers with Gray, is also critical of Gray for his personal attacks on the scientists with whom he disagreed.

He is also the president of the Brotherhood Organization of a New Destiny (BOND) since 1990. He's host of the YouTube talk show The Fallen State, as well as a weekday call-in program The Jesse Lee Peterson Radio Show, and a religious Sunday service program Church with Jesse Lee Peterson. Prior to entering political commentary, he was a small business owner after moving to California from his native Alabama in 1968. Early life Peterson was born on May 22, 1949, in Midway, Alabama, and raised in Comer Hill, Alabama, by his grandparents, who worked on the Comer family plantation where his great-grandparents had been enslaved a century earlier. His mother and father moved to Gary, Indiana, and East Chicago, Indiana, respectively, where they separately started new families of their own. He was born with a cleft palate that was not repaired until his teens. Peterson lived with his mother and stepfather in Gary as a teenager, briefly attending Edison High School. He then returned to Alabama and graduated from high school before moving to Los Angeles. Peterson has stated he attended Los Angeles City College for one year. Peterson often says that he \\"unfortunately\\" made a son out-of-wedlock while in Alabama. He claims that he has been engaged twice, but never married. In speeches and on his radio program, he says that he broke off the latter engagement because his fianc√©e became too \\"controlling\\" and \\"playing games,\\" while he was committed to his work. Political involvement Peterson started his own janitorial service in 1989. In 1990, he founded BOND (Brotherhood Organization of a New Destiny), later registered as a non-profit religious group geared towards young black men. Peterson has been a member of Choose Black America, an organization of African Americans who oppose illegal immigration to the United States. In August 2000, Peterson spoke at the Reform Party National Convention, introducing Pat Buchanan's running mate, vice presidential candidate Ezola Foster, a school teacher and anti-illegal- immigration activist from the Los Angeles area. Conservative talk radio host Dennis Prager has written the foreword to two of Peterson's books, From Rage to Responsibility (2000) and The Antidote: Healing America from the Poison of Hate, Blame and Victimhood (2015). Peterson's radio show, once broadcast from WTSB, was simulcast on Newsmax TV in 2017-2018. In 2020, Peterson appeared in the political documentary Uncle Tom, produced by radio host Larry Elder. In the film, which featured several prominent black conservatives, Peterson boasted of winning a \\"Coon of the Year\\" award. = Debates = In 1990, Peterson appeared on Phil Donahue and Geraldo Rivera's daytime talk shows, both featuring Shahrazad Ali, controversial author of The Blackman's Guide to Understanding the Blackwoman, a book strongly criticized as \\"sexist,\\" unscientific, and riddled with stereotypes. In video recordings of episodes, Peterson is heard defending Ali's book, stating that black single mothers are \\"out of order\\" in raising children without their father. Peterson claims that mothers \\"destroy the children\\" by speaking ill of the fathers. Peterson states that the man is the \\"head\\" of his wife, and that without men leading, women and children go \\"out-of-control,\\" and young men grow up angry and insecure. Inspirational speaker Iyanla Vanzant also appeared in the Geraldo episode, condemning Ali's book as \\"anti-African,\\" stating that the book \\"contains no love,\\" and saying that the African woman is \\"the most loving force on this earth.\\" In August 2002, Peterson participated in a debate with Michael Eric Dyson, author and professor at the University of Pennsylvania, on \\"The Case For/Against Reparations for African Americans,\\" held at the annual convention of the National Association of Black Journalists. Peterson alleges that black journalists in attendance jeered him and called him \\"the white man's boy.\\" After the debate, Dyson wrote in his weekly column for the Chicago Sun-Times that Peterson is a \\"self-hating black man who despises black culture and worships at the altar of whiteness.\\" Days later, Peterson and Dyson accused each other of \\"hatred\\" on the Fox News program Hannity & Colmes. Peterson has participated in several panel discussions and debates at the annual political convention Politicon, appearing alongside author and commentator Sally Kohn, Democratic Congresswoman Karen Bass, comedian John Fugelsang, anti-abortion activist Dr. Alveda King, singer Kaya Jones, and Breitbart writer Joel Pollak. In 2017, Peterson participated in a heated debate on immigration at Politicon, versus Democratic Congressman Ted Lieu of California, ACLU of Los Angeles executive director Hector Villagra, immigrant rights activist Julissa Arce, and The Atlantic writer Vann R. Newkirk II. Former MSNBC host Krystal Ball moderated the discussion on immigration policy and President Trump‚Äôs southern border wall. In video of the event, Peterson states that \\"illegals\\" should be \\"shipped back home\\" to their countries of origin. He states that his opponents \\"don‚Äôt care about blacks.\\" Ball asks Peterson not to make personal attacks. Peterson says that Democrats like Rep. Lieu \\"make people feel good about being wrong.\\" Peterson also states that the ACLU is \\"unamerican.\\" In rebuttal, ACLU director Hector Villagra suggests that he's \\"more American\\" than Peterson, since he fights for civil rights. At the end, moderator Krystal Ball asks the panel members to hold hands for a group prayer led by Peterson. = Protests = On July 4, 1996, Peterson and members of his nonprofit organization BOND joined the anti-illegal-immigration activist Glenn Spencer and his group Voices of Citizens Together in a Los Angeles rally outside the Wilshire Federal Building, demanding deportations of undocumented immigrants and enforcement of 1994 California Proposition 187. The protest turned violent as immigrant rights groups, La Raza, and Revolutionary Communist Party members counter-protested, according to local coverage by ABC7, NBC4, and Fox11. Six were injured in fights, including purportedly a friend of Peterson's named Martin Francis who appeared to be bleeding from the head. Francis alleged that someone was throwing frozen soda cans at people, and that one hit him on the head when he baited the counter-protestors. Video from after the incident shows Peterson berating a Univision reporter after she asked Francis, who was white, if he was \\"racist.\\" Peterson established an annual \\"National Day of Repudiation of Jesse Jackson\\" event, which lasted from 1999 to 2004, and which was held outside Jackson's offices in Los Angeles. In January 2006, a jury cleared Jackson of allegations that he had threatened and violated the civil rights of Peterson in a 2001 incident at a meeting with Toyota executives in Los Angeles. Peterson also accused Rev. Jackson's son Jonathan Jackson of assault. Conservative organization Judicial Watch provided attorneys for Peterson in the case. In June 2010, Peterson was asked by Los Angeles Sheriffs to leave the hall after he loudly protested the vote of county Supervisor Mark Ridley-Thomas. The L.A. County Board of Supervisors voted 3-2 to join an economic boycott against the state of Arizona for its controversial immigration law SB 1070, which many feared would increase racial and ethnic profiling of Latino Americans. More than 60 people spoke on both sides of the issue, including Jamiel Shaw Sr., whose son Jamiel Shaw Jr. was murdered by an undocumented immigrant and suspected gang member. Shaw was also removed for emotional outbursts. In July 2011, Peterson led a small Tea Party protest outside a NAACP convention in Los Angeles. He stated, \\"The NAACP is no different than the KKK, in that the KKK harmed black Americans by their physical bodies, but the NAACP steals their hearts and minds and souls. And they kill black Americans by... causing black Americans to hate their country, to hate what's right, to depend on the government rather than depending on themselves.\\" In March 2013 at a city council meeting in Glendale, California, Peterson had a shouting match with Mayor Frank Quintero, which ended in a police officer escorting the founder of the South Central L.A. Tea Party out of the chambers. The conflict arose amid a move by the city to ban the Glendale Gun Show following the Sandy Hook Elementary School shooting. In October 2016, Peterson held a press conference and sparsely-attended protest outside attorney Gloria Allred's Los Angeles office, criticizing her for representing a woman who accused Republican presidential candidate Donald Trump of sexual assault. Peterson stated, \\"My beef with Gloria Allred is she digs these women up and she used them in order to destroy the Republican candidate. She's a hypocrite and a liar. She just wants to stop Donald Trump and she's using these women for that purpose only.\\" Allred released a statement to ABC7: \\"This is not an issue of whether a man is a Republican or a Democrat,\\" Allred said. \\"It is an issue of respect for women and women's right to be free of sexual assaults and sexual harassment.\\" In July 2017, Peterson testified before California lawmakers against a proposed bail reform law eliminating cash bail for many defendants. In confronting an author of the bill Robert Hertzberg, Peterson stated, \\"Senator Hertzberg and the sponsors of this bill hate black people. They hate black women; they hate black children.\\" After a warning for the personal attack, Peterson again addressed Hertzberg: \\"You, sir, don‚Äôt respect black people. You don‚Äôt live in those communities.\\" At that point, Assemblyman Reggie Jones-Sawyer, Chairman of the Public Safety Committee, shut off Peterson‚Äôs microphone and eventually threatened to have him ejected. Political views Peterson has described on many occasions what he perceives as the Atlantic slave trade's positive aspects, saying, \\"I've often said that, 'Thank God for slavery,' because, you know, had not, then the blacks over here would have been stuck in Africa‚Ä¶ Everybody and their mama are trying to get out of Africa and come to America. And so God has a way of looking out for folks, and He made it possible, by way of slavery, to get black folks into this country.... I thank God that he got me here. And to show my appreciation to the blacks who suffered as a result of coming here, and Arabs and blacks who sold us to the white man, the white man for going there and getting us and bringing us here: I want to say, 'Thanks.'\\" Peterson has spoken out against Kwanzaa and Black History Month. On September 21, 2005, Peterson penned a column for WorldNetDaily, in which he suggested the majority of the African American people stranded in New Orleans during Hurricane Katrina were relying on the government to save them. In a January 2012 interview with Huffington Post's Black Voices, Peterson said about black unemployment in the U.S., \\"One of the things that I would do is take all black people back to the South and put them on the plantation so they would understand the ethic of working. I'm going to put them all on the plantation. They need a good hard education on what it is to work.\\" In a 2018 interview with Yahoo News, he stated, \\"The Democratic plantation really is worse than the plantation I grew up on. We were not told about so-called racism; we worked hard. My grandparents worked hard and their parents worked hard. We were very independent. Unlike the Democratic Party ‚Äî their plantation causes you to become dependent on them and not on yourself. Once you become addicted to that, they will not let you off. If you try to get off, you are attacked. You're called Uncle Tom, a sellout, the N-word, all kind of craziness because they do not want you to leave that plantation.\\" Peterson once called for the resignation of Republican National Committee chairman Michael Steele, saying he was not conservative enough but that Republicans were afraid of firing a black man. Peterson has described Nelson Mandela as an ‚Äúevil man‚Äù and said that South Africa was better off under apartheid. Peterson says that racism does not exist, and condemns the U.S. education system and the Democratic Party as \\"lying about the country\\" and falsely calling people racist. In March 2019, Peterson derided the use of the term \\"white supremacist,\\" saying that he does not know what it means. He stated that \\"antifa people are protected\\" while \\"normal whites\\" are called white supremacists. He asserted that Muslims in America are \\"treated better\\" than Christians and white people. He criticized Muslim U.S. Congresswomen Rashida Tlaib and Ilhan Omar, stating, \\"We just saw where they allow two Muslims to become congressmen [sic] in our government, and that is not good. Those two women hate Israel, and they hate America.\\" After the Christchurch mosque shootings, Peterson warned that \\"white people are getting angry rather than speaking up prior to anger.\\" Peterson warns that \\"hatred and suspicion\\" toward white Americans would cause the United States to become \\"like South Africa\\". On July 2, 2018, Peterson announced he would celebrate \\"White History Month\\" each year in July in honor of patriotic white Americans. In an interview with model and activist Amber Rose, Peterson stated that women who have sex with different men are \\"sluts.\\" Rose, who in 2015 led the Los Angeles-based SlutWalk, asked, \\"What does it make you if you have sex with different women?\\" Peterson replied, \\"A slut maker.\\" In the interview, which aired on Peterson's YouTube talk show The Fallen State, Peterson referred to U.S. President Donald Trump as \\"The Great White Hope.\\" Amber Rose responded by comparing Donald Trump to rapper Kanye West \\"in a white man's body.\\" Peterson has said on his radio show that President Trump is \\"of God.\\" After Congressman John Lewis died, Peterson cited other deceased public figures who opposed Trump, including the late Sen. John McCain and conservative columnist Charles Krauthammer, and Peterson stated, \\"That's what happens when you mess with the Great White Hope. Don't mess with God's children.\\"  Controversies  Peterson revealed in a video from a sermon, released on March 5, 2012, his belief that \\"one of the greatest mistakes America made was to allow women the opportunity to vote.\\" He also criticized women in positions of power, saying \\"You walk up to them with an issue, they freak out right away. They go nuts. They get mad. They get upset, just like that. They have no patience because it's not in their nature. They don't have love.\\" Writer and political analyst Kirsten Powers confronted Peterson on Sean Hannity's program on Fox News, accusing him of using the pulpit to promote \\"misogyny.\\" However, Peterson doubled down with statements against \\"liberal women.\\" Powers pointed out that he did not qualify his criticisms as only against \\"liberal women,\\" and asserted, \\"You said 'women.'\\" On CNN with Piers Morgan, Peterson called Trayvon Martin a \\"thug,\\" citing his suspension from school, and his being pictured on his Facebook page with a gun and with marijuana. In response, Morgan stated that there was \\"no evidence\\" that Martin was a \\"thug,\\" and called Peterson's comments \\"quite offensive.\\" On Fox News with host Sean Hannity and guest, civil rights attorney and radio host Leo Terrell, Peterson defended the presumptive innocence of former North Charleston Police Officer Michael Slager who shot black victim Walter Scott multiple times in the back, killing him. \\"In America you are innocent until proven guilty,\\" Peterson argued, \\"and right now... white officers are under attack by angry black folks in this country, and when they're stopped by these officers, they're not listening, they're not obeying the authority of the police officers.... [W]e should wait for due process because I don't think Americans understand how angry and brainwashed these young black folks are.\\" Upset, Leo Terrell said, \\"I'm gone,\\" and walked off-camera, ending his portion of the interview prematurely. Sean Hannity also disagreed with Peterson, saying that there was no justification for former Officer Slager to shoot Walter Scott in the back. Peterson calls the Black Lives Matter movement a \\"hate group\\" and compares the racial injustice protesters to the Ku Klux Klan. In a May 2018 interview on Good Morning Britain, Peterson stated, \\"Black Lives Matter is a far-left liberal, radical, agitative organization founded by a bunch of black lesbians and homosexuals and radical social justice warriors.\\" In response, Good Morning Britain host Piers Morgan accused Peterson of \\"homophobia,\\" and Peterson's microphone was muted before he was kicked off the show. Peterson believes that \\"children's souls yearn for the souls of their natural mother and natural father, especially the father,\\" and so he discourages bringing stepparents into children's lives. Leftwing commentators wrote that Peterson suggested that a child conceived by rape should be raised by the rapist.RWW News: Jesse Lee Peterson Says A Child Conceived in Rape Should Be Raised by the Rapist - YouTube On his online radio program September 4, 2019, Peterson criticized Democratic presidential primary candidate Andrew Yang, calling him a \\"communist\\" for his universal basic income proposal. Peterson referred to Yang, a U.S. citizen born in New York to Taiwanese immigrants, as \\"this little Asian guy or Chinese guy or whatever he is.\\" Peterson stated that \\"he should go back to China or wherever he came from. You allow these people to come into our country and they come in with their socialist, communist ideas. Can we send this guy back to wherever he came from? Let him go over there and give away free stuff. Why is he coming here to turn America into the place that he left? What a sick person. Beta male! They need to send him back to Taiwan or wherever he came from.\\" Published works * From Rage to Responsibility: Black Conservative Jesse Lee Peterson and America Today, with Dennis Prager and Brad Stetson.

the holding company set up to own Trans World Airlines. In 1967, when the airline sought to diversify into other areas of business, a key investment was Hilton International Hotels, the non-American interests of the Hilton Hotels chain. (Because of this split, the Hilton International chain had to call its hotels in America Vista, while future overseas locations of the American Hilton chain were called Conrad International. This operation was later sold by Trans World Corporation while under the leadership of Charles C. Tillinghast Jr. the CEO of TWA and the first known to receive a golden parachute employment contract. In 1983, Trans World Corporation, under Chief Executive Officer L. Edwin Smart, spun off Trans World Airlines to Carl C. Icahn, At the time of TWA's spinoff, TWC owned Spartan Food Systems Inc., the Canteen Corporation, Hilton International, and Century 21 Real Estate Corporation. As a result of both Trans World Airlines and Trans World Corporation being publicly traded prior to the spinoff, public records permitted analysis which indicates that \\"wealth transfer\\" of a sale of TWA was as much a reason for the sale of TWA as was a desirability to \\"restructure union contracts\\". Conversely, it was circa 1982-1984 when UAL Corporation and AMR Corporation, the parent companies of United Airlines and American Airlines first took shape. This period is also an era marked by extremely competitive airline industry forces fighting for deregulation survival along with fighting for opportunities of vast individual creations of wealth characterized by those accumulated by leading industry figures but sullied names such as Frank Lorenzo and Carl Icahn during the 1980s. In 1986, TWC was liquidated. TW Services was formed at end of 1986 upon the dissolution of Transworld Corp. L. Edwin Smart remained head of TW Services Inc., the successor of Trans World Corporation which remained headquartered in the same building and shared many directors as Trans World Corporation. TW Services Inc. continued the use of the TW ticker symbol on the NYSE. Its business centered on food services and retirement care. TW Services was the target of several hostile take over attempts which ended in June 1989 when TW Services agreed to be taken over by Conniston Partners for $1.65 billion. As part of the buy out, TW Services moved its headquarters from New York City to Spartanburg, South Carolina. Flagstar Companies In 1992, private equity firm, Kohlberg Kravis Roberts acquired a 47% interest in TW Corporation, later known as The Flagstar Companies, and encouraged the company to sell non-core businesses. The following year, TW Services changed its name to The Flagstar Companies in its bid to focus on the food service industry with a portfolio of businesses including Volume Services America, Hardee's, Quincy's Family Steakhouse, El Pollo Loco, Canteen Corporation and Denny's. After accumulating $2.2 billion in debt, Flagstar filed for Chapter 11 bankruptcy protection from its creditors in a Federal bankruptcy court in South Carolina in July 1997. Six months later, Flagstar emerged from bankruptcy as Advantica Restaurant Group Inc. and with three-fourths of its stock controlled by four of the former Flagstar's senior creditors. At the time of emergence, Advantica owned Denny's, Carrows, Coco's, El Pollo Loco and Quincy's Family Steakhouse and was the largest franchisee of Hardee's restaurants. Advantica paid off its inherited debt by selling off most of its holdings. In November 1999, Advantica sold El Pollo Loco to an investment firm for $114 Million plus the assumption of $14 million in debt. Today the remnants of the corporation are Denny's. Trans World Corporation was the predecessor of the way and manner in which many of the airlines with holdings and holding parent companies conduct and create their business structural organization.

Originally known as the VAZ-2123 (1998 - 2002), the SUV was branded as the Chevrolet Niva between 2003 and 2020 when AvtoVAZ (the parent company of the Lada brand) was in a joint venture with General Motors called GM-AvtoVAZ. The car was rebranded as the Lada Niva in 2020 after General Motors sold its 50-percent stake in the firm, which means that the car now has the same name that the Lada 4x4/VAZ-2121 has in certain European markets (with the VAZ-2123 being a development of the earlier VAZ-2121). VAZ-2123 (1998‚Äì2002) Chevrolet Niva (2003‚Äì2009) It features an updated body and 1.7-litre gasoline engine with fuel injection. Although the body and the interiors are new, it is still based on the old VAZ 2121 engine, transmission and most mechanicals. In 2003 the car was awarded zero stars out of a possible four by the Russian ARCAP safety assessment program. An export version with reinforced hull, 1.8-litre Opel Ecotec Family 1 gasoline engine and Aisin four-wheel drive has been under consideration since 2003. Although most of the engineering work has been completed, the release has been constantly postponed. Although the GM-AvtoVAZ considered building a new engine plant for the local production of Ecotecs, in July 2005 it was announced that the project was cancelled, along with plans for the long-anticipated \\"export\\" Niva. However, the project was revived in Fall 2006 and the \\"Niva FAM1\\" was introduced as a new trim level for the 2007 model year. The price was much higher than the standard trim, that made the project not as successful and led it to be discontinued in April 2008. Another reason was the ceasing of Ecotec engine production at the Hungarian plant. In 2009, the model got a minor update, featuring a slight restyling, done by Bertone studio and some minor- changes. The GLS and GLC version also comes with improved safety, such as ABS and dual front airbags. In August 2020 Lada took over production of the Chevy Niva rebranding it as the Lada Niva.http://info.avtovaz.ru/press- releases/117703.html Niva –≤–æ–∑–≤—Ä–∞—â–∞–µ—Ç—Å—è –≤ —Å–µ–º—å—é LADA! (EN:Niva returns to the Lada family) Chevrolet Niva Concept (2014) GM-AvtoVAZ introduced a concept vehicle for a new generation of the Chevrolet Niva at the Moscow International Automobile Salon in late August 2014. The Niva Concept, designed by Ondrej Koromh√°z of GM (or at General Motors' headquarters in Melbourne according to other sources), had a longitudinal mounted engine, full-time four-wheel-drive, two-gear transfer case and rigid-axle rear suspension. The production model was supposed to get a 1.8-liter PSA Peugeot Citro√´n EC8 engine (135 hp) paired with a 5-speed manual gearbox, although more recent news reports suggested that it was planned to be based on the Renault Duster platform. The new model's production version was initially expected in 2016, but following Chevrolet stopping sales of its mainstream models in Russia, no further information has been released on the topic. In September 2018, it was reported that GM has suspended all the work on planned replacement of Chevrolet Niva.

in a peridotite weathering to iddingsite within a mantle xenolith Ultramafic rocks (also referred to as ultrabasic rocks, although the terms are not wholly equivalent) are igneous and meta-igneous rocks with a very low silica content (less than 45%), generally >18% MgO, high FeO, low potassium, and are composed of usually greater than 90% mafic minerals (dark colored, high magnesium and iron content). The Earth's mantle is composed of ultramafic rocks. Ultrabasic is a more inclusive term that includes igneous rocks with low silica content that may not be extremely enriched in Fe and Mg, such as carbonatites and ultrapotassic igneous rocks. Intrusive ultramafic rocks mantle peridotite. Intrusive ultramafic rocks are often found in large, layered ultramafic intrusions where differentiated rock types often occur in layers.Ballhaus, C.G. & Glikson, A.Y., 1995, Petrology of layered mafic- ultramafic intrusions of the Giles Complex, western Musgrave Block, central Australia. AGSO Journal, 16/1&2: 69-90. Such cumulate rock types do not represent the chemistry of the magma from which they crystallized. The ultramafic intrusives include the dunites, peridotites and pyroxenites. Other rare varieties include troctolite which has a greater percentage of calcic plagioclase. These grade into the anorthosites. Gabbro and norite often occur in the upper portions of the layered ultramafic sequences. Hornblendite and, rarely phlogopite, are also found. Volcanic ultramafic rocks on Earth Volcanic ultramafic rocks are rare outside of the Archaean and are essentially restricted to the Neoproterozoic or earlier, although some boninite lavas currently erupted within back-arc basins (Manus Trough, New Guinea) verge on being ultramafic. Subvolcanic ultramafic rocks and dykes persist longer, but are also rare. There is evidence of ultramafic rocks elsewhere in the solar system. Examples include komatiiteHill R.E.T, Barnes S.J., Gole M.J., and Dowling S.E., 1990. Physical volcanology of komatiites; A field guide to the komatiites of the Norseman-Wiluna Greenstone Belt, Eastern Goldfields Province, Yilgarn Block, Western Australia., Geological Society of Australia. and picritic basalt. Komatiites can be host to ore deposits of nickel.Lesher, C.M., Arndt, N.T., and Groves, D.I., 1984, Genesis of komatiite-associated nickel sulfide deposits at Kambalda, Western Australia: A distal volcanic model, in Buchanan, D.L., and Jones, M.J. (Editors), Sulphide Deposits in Mafic and Ultramafic Rocks, Institution of Mining and Metallurgy, London, p. 70-80. = Ultramafic tuff = Ultramafic tuff is extremely rare. It has a characteristic abundance of olivine or serpentine and a scarcity or absence of feldspar and quartz. Rare occurrences may include unusual surface deposits of maars of kimberlites in the diamond fields of southern Africa and other regions. Ultrapotassic ultramafic rocks Technically ultrapotassic rocks and melilitic rocks are considered a separate group, based on melting model criteria, but there are ultrapotassic and highly silica-under-saturated rocks with >18% MgO which can be considered \\"ultramafic\\". Ultrapotassic, ultramafic igneous rocks such as lamprophyre, lamproite and kimberlite are known to have reached the surface of the Earth. Although no modern eruptions have been observed, analogues are preserved. Most of these rocks occur as dikes, diatremes, lopoliths or laccoliths, and very rarely, intrusions. Most kimberlite and lamproite occurrences occur as volcanic and subvolcanic diatremes and maars; lavas are virtually unknown. Vents of Proterozoic lamproite (Argyle diamond mine), and Cenozoic lamproite (Gaussberg, Antarctica) are known, as are vents of Devonian lamprophyre (Scotland). Kimberlite pipes in Canada, Russia and South Africa have incompletely preserved tephra and agglomerate facies. These are generally diatreme events and as such are not lava flows although tephra and ash deposits are partially preserved. These represent low-volume volatile melts and attain their ultramafic chemistry via a different process than typical ultramafic rocks. Metamorphic ultramafic rocks Metamorphism of ultramafic rocks in the presence of water and/or carbon dioxide results in two main classes of metamorphic ultramafic rock; talc carbonate and serpentinite. Talc carbonation reactions occur in ultramafic rocks at lower greenschist through to granulite facies metamorphism when the rock in question is subjected to metamorphism and the metamorphic fluid has more than 10% molar proportion of CO2 (carbon dioxide). When such metamorphic fluids have less than 10% molar proportion of CO2, reactions favor serpentinisation, resulting in chlorite-serpentine- amphibole type assemblages. Distribution in space and time The majority of ultramafic rocks are exposed in orogenic belts, and predominate in Archaean and Proterozoic terranes. Ultramafic magmas in the Phanerozoic are rarer, and there are very few recognised true ultramafic lavas in the Phanerozoic. Many surface exposures of ultramafic rocks occur in ophiolite complexes where deep mantle-derived rocks have been obducted onto continental crust along and above subduction zones. Soil and regolith on ultramafic rock Serpentine soil is a magnesium rich, calcium, potassium and phosphorus poor soil that develops on the regolith derived from ultramafic rocks. Ultramafic rocks also contain elevated amounts of chromium and nickel which may be toxic to plants. As a result, a distinctive type of vegetation develops on these soils. Examples are the ultramafic woodlands and barrens of the Appalachian mountains and piedmont, the \\"wet maquis\\" of the New Caledonia rain forests, and the ultramafic forests of Mount Kinabalu and other peaks in Sabah, Malaysia. Vegetation is typically stunted, and sometimes includes endemic species adapted to the soils. Often thick, magnesite-calcrete caprock, laterite and duricrust forms over ultramafic rocks in tropical and subtropical environments. Particular floral assemblages associated with highly nickeliferous ultramafic rocks are indicative tools for mineral exploration. Weathered ultramafic rocks may form lateritic nickel ore deposits.Golightly, J.P. (1981): Nickeliferous Laterite Deposits. Economic Geology 75, 710-735Schellmann, W. (1983): Geochemical principles of lateritic nickel ore formation. Proceedings of the 2. International Seminar on Lateritisation Processes, Sao Paulo, 119-135 Possible detection on Io Ultramafic lava may have been detected on Io, a moon of Jupiter, because heat-mapping of Io's surface found ultra-hot areas with temperatures in excess of . The lava immediately below these hots spots is probably about hotter, based on surface- to-subsurface temperature differences observed for lava on Earth. A temperature of is thought to indicate the presence of ultramafic lava. Mercury also appears to have ultramafic volcanic rock.

then Japanese folklore, classical kaidan, essays, etc. There are two very different types: those that live in the mountains and domestic cats that have grown old and transformed.Â§öÁî∞ (2000)„ÄÅ170‚Äì171È†Å„ÄÇ Nekomata are often confused with Bakeneko. Mountain Nekomata \\"\\" from the \\"Tonoigusa\\" by Ogita Ansei (1660). A scene of a hunter shooting a nekomata that has shapeshifted into the hunter's mother. In China, nekomata appear in stories even earlier than in Japan. In the Sui dynasty, the words Áå´È¨º and ÈáëËä±Áå´ described mysterious cats. In Japanese literature, the nekomata first appeared in the Meigetsuki by Fujiwara no Teika in the early Kamakura period: in the beginning of Tenpuku (1233), August 2, in Nanto (now Nara Prefecture), a nekomata (Áå´ËÉØ) was said to have killed and eaten several people in one night. The nekomata was described as a mountain beast: according to the Meigetsuki, \\"They have eyes like a cat, and have a large body like a dog.\\" The essay Tsurezuregusa from the late Kamakura period (circa 1331) asserts, \\".\\"Âπ≥Â≤© (1992)„ÄÅ36‚Äì66È†Å„ÄÇ However, many people question whether the nekomata really is a cat monster.Á¨πÈñì (1994)„ÄÅ127‚Äì128È†Å„ÄÇ Since people are said to suffer an illness called \\"\\", some interpret the nekomata to be a beast that has caught rabies.Áü≥Â∑ù (1986)„ÄÅ696È†Å„ÄÇ Even in the kaidan collections, the \\"\\" and the \\",\\" nekomata conceal themselves in mountain recesses; and there are stories that deep in the mountains they shapeshift into humans. In folk religion there are many stories of mountainous nekomata. In later literature, the mountain nekomata tend to be larger. In the \\"\\" nekomata captured in the mountains of Kii Province are as large as a wild boar; in the \\"\\" of 1775 (Anei 4), their roaring echos throughout the mountain, and they can be seen as big as a lion or leopard. In the \\"\\" of 1809 (Bunka 6), a nekomata that held a dog in its mouth was described as having a span of 9 shaku and 5 sun (about 2.8 meters). In Etch≈´ Province (now Toyama Prefecture), in Aizu, at Nekomatayama said to be where nekomata would devour humans (now Fukushima Prefecture), nekomata that shapeshift into humans and deceive people, like Mount Nekomadake, the legends sometimes are named after the name of the associated mountain. Regarding Nekomatayama and altogether disregarding folklore, there are in fact large cats that attack humans. Domestic Cat Nekomata At the same time, in the Kokon Chomonj≈´ of the Kamakura period, in the story \\"\\", an old cat raised in a villa on a mountain precipice held a secret treasure, a protective sword, in its mouth and ran away. People chased the cat, but it disguised itself and left behind the thought of the cat becoming a monster. In the aforementioned \\"Tsurezuregusa,\\" in addition to nekomata that conceal themselves in the mountains, there are descriptions of pet cats that grow old, transform, and eat and abduct people. Since the Edo period, it has become generally believed that domestic cats turn into nekomata as they grow old, and mountainous nekomata have come to be interpreted as cats that have run away to live in the mountains. As a result, throughout Japan a folk belief developed that cats should not be kept for long periods. In the \\"\\" the courtier Sadatake Ise stated, \\"A cat that is several years of age will come to have two tails, and become the y≈çkai called nekomata.\\" The mid-Edo period scholar Arai Hakuseki stated, \\"Old cats become 'nekomata' and bewilder people.\\" and indicated that at that time it was common to believe that cats become nekomata. Even the Edo-period Kawaraban reported this strange phenomenon. In the book Yamato Kaiiki (, engl. \\"Mysterious stories from Japan\\"), written by an unknown author in 1708, one story speaks of a rich samurai's haunted house where the inhabitants witnessed several poltergeist activities. Attempting to end those events, the samurai called upon countless shamans, priests and evokers; but none of them could locate the source of the terror. One day, one of the most loyal servants saw his master's aged cat carrying in its mouth a shikigami with the samurai's name imprinted on it. Immediately shooting a sacred arrow, the servant hit the cat in its head; and as it lay dead on the floor, everyone could see that the cat had two tails and therefore had become a nekomata. With its death, the poltergeist activities ended. Similar eerie stories about encounters with nekomata appear in books such as Taihei Hyakumonogatari (, engl. Collection of 100 fairy tales), written by Yusuke (, or Y≈´sa) in 1723 and in R≈ç≈ç Chabanashi (, Tea-time gossip of old ladies), by Misaka Daiyata (), 1742. It is generally said that the \\"mata\\" (Âèà) of \\"nekomata\\" refers to their having two tails; but from the perspective of folkloristics, this appears questionable. Since nekomata transform as they age, \\"mata\\" meaning \\"repetition\\" is postulated. Alternatively, since they were once thought to be mountain beasts, there is a theory that \\"mata\\" (Áà∞) refers to monkeys, since nekomata can come and go freely among the mountain trees. There is also a theory that the term derives from the way in which cats that grow old shed the skin off their backs and hang downwards, making it appear that they have two tails. In Japan cats are often associated with death, and this particular spirit is often blamed. Far darker and more malevolent than most bakeneko, the nekomata is said to have powers of necromancy, and upon raising the dead, will control them with ritualistic dances, gesturing with paw and tail. These y≈çkai are associated with strange fires and other inexplicable occurrences. The older and more abused a cat is prior to its transformation, the more power the nekomata is said to have. To gain revenge against those who wronged it, the spirit may haunt humans with visitations from their deceased relatives. Some tales state that these demons, like bakeneko, assume human appearances, usually appearing as older women, behaving badly in public, and bringing gloom and malevolence wherever they travel. Due to these beliefs, sometimes kittens' tails were cut off based on the assumption that if the tails could not fork, the cats could not become nekomata. From this discernment and strange characteristics, nekomata have been considered devilish from time immemorial. Due to fears and folk beliefs such as the dead resurrecting at a funeral, or that seven generations would be cursed as a result of killing a cat, it is thought that the legend of the nekomata was born. Also, in folk beliefs cats and the dead are related. As carnivores, cats have a keen sense of detecting the smell of rot, so it was believed that they had a habit of approaching corpses; with this folk belief sometimes the kasha, a y≈çkai that steals corpses are seen to be the same as the nekomata. Also in Japan there are cat y≈çkai called bakeneko; and since nekomata are the y≈çkai of transformed cats, sometimes nekomata are confused with bakeneko. Y≈çkai depictions Nekomata (Áå´„Åæ„Åü) from Bakemono no e (ÂåñÁâ©‰πãÁπ™, c. 1700), Harry F. Bruning Collection of Japanese Books and Manuscripts, L. Tom Perry Special Collections, Harold B. Lee Library, Brigham Young University. from the Gazu Hyakki Yagy≈ç by Sekien Toriyama In the Edo period many books illustrating and describing y≈çkai were published (y≈çkai emaki), with nekomata frequently depicted. The Hyakkai Zukan published in 1737 (Gembun 2) includes an illustration of a nekomata assuming the appearance of a woman playing a shamisen. (See the first image on this page.) Since Edo-period shamisen frequently were made using cat skins, that particular nekomata sang a sad song about its species as it plucked the strings. Understandably, the image has been interpreted as ironic.Âè§Â±±‰ªñ (2005)„ÄÅ155È†Å„ÄÇ As for the nekomata's wearing geisha clothing, sometimes nekomata and geisha are considered related since geisha were once called \\"cats (neko)\\" Also shown at the right, the Gazu Hyakki Yagy≈ç of 1776 (An'ei 5) depicts a cat with its head protruding from a sh≈çji screen, a cat with a handkerchief on its head and its forepaw on the veranda, and a cat wearing a handkerchief and standing upright. The less experienced cat has difficulty standing on its hind legs while the older cat is able to do so: we are viewing the process by which a normal cat ages and transforms into a nekomata. In the Bigelow ukiyo-e collection at the Museum of Fine Arts, Boston, the Hyakki Yagy≈ç Emaki includes a similar composition, leading some scholars to see a relationship between the books. Senri In Chinese lore there is a cat y≈çkai called \\"senri (‰ªôÁã∏)\\" (where Áã∏ means \\"leopard cat\\"). In this telling, leopard cats that grow old gain a divine spiritual power, shapeshift into a beautiful man or woman, and suck the spirit out of humans. Some theorize that the Japanese nekomata legends derive from Chinese senri tales.

Its purpose is to increase the apparent signal-to-noise ratio of the resultant signal. It does this by altering the spectral shape of the error that is introduced by dithering and quantization; such that the noise power is at a lower level in frequency bands at which noise is considered to be less desirable and at a correspondingly higher level in bands where it is considered to be more desirable. A popular noise shaping algorithm used in image processing is known as ‚ÄòFloyd Steinberg dithering‚Äô; and many noise shaping algorithms used in audio processing are based on an ‚ÄòAbsolute threshold of hearing‚Äô model.  Introduction  Noise shaping works by putting the quantization error in a feedback loop. Any feedback loop functions as a filter, so by creating a feedback loop for the error itself, the error can be filtered as desired. For example, consider the feedback system: : \\\\ y[n] = x[n] + e[n-1], where y[n] is the output sample value that is to be quantized, x[n] is the input sample value, n is the sample number, and e[n] is the quantization error introduced at sample n: : \\\\ e[n] = y_\\\\text{quantized}[n] - y[n]. In this model, when any sample's bit depth is reduced, the quantization error between the quantized value and the original value is measured and stored. That \\"error value\\" is then re-added into the next sample prior to its quantization. The effect is that the quantization error is low-pass filtered by a 2-sample rectangular filter (also known as an averaging filter). As a result, compared to before, the quantization error has lower power at higher frequencies and higher power at lower frequencies. Note that we can adjust the cutoff frequency of the filter by modifying the proportion, b, of the error from the previous sample that is fed back: : \\\\ y[n] = x[n] + b e[n-1] More generally, any FIR filter or IIR filter can be used to create a more complex frequency response curve. Such filters can be designed using the weighted least squares method. In the case of digital audio, typically the weighting function used is one divided by the absolute threshold of hearing curve, i.e. : \\\\ W(f) = \\\\frac{1}{A(f)}. Noise shaping should also always involve an appropriate amount of dither within the process itself so as to prevent determinable and correlated errors to the signal itself. If dither is not used then noise shaping effectively functions merely as distortion shaping ‚Äî pushing the distortion energy around to different frequency bands, but it is still distortion. If dither is added to the process as :\\\\ y[n] = x[n] + b e[n-1] + \\\\mathrm{dither}, then the quantization error truly becomes noise, and the process indeed yields noise shaping.  In digital audio  Noise shaping in audio is most commonly applied as a bit-reduction scheme. The most basic form of dither is flat, white noise. The ear, however, is less sensitive to certain frequencies than others at low levels (see Fletcher-Munson curves). By using noise shaping the quantization error can be effectively spread around so that more of it is focused on frequencies that can't be heard as well and less of it is focused on frequencies that can. The result is that where the ear is most critical the quantization error can be reduced greatly and where the ears are less sensitive the noise is much greater. This can give a perceived noise reduction of 4 bits compared to straight dither. While 16-bit audio is typically thought to have 96 dB of dynamic range (see quantization distortion calculations), it can actually be increased to 120 dB using noise-shaped dither. = Noise shaping and 1-bit converters = Since around 1989, 1 bit delta-sigma modulators have been used in analog-to-digital converters. This involves sampling the audio at a very high rate (2.8224 million samples per second, for example) but only using a single bit. Because only 1 bit is used, this converter only has 6.02 dB of dynamic range. The noise floor, however, is spread throughout the entire \\"legal\\" frequency range below the Nyquist frequency of 1.4112 MHz. Noise shaping is used to lower the noise present in the audible range (20 Hz to 20 kHz) and increase the noise above the audible range. This results in a broadband dynamic range of only 7.78 dB, but it is not consistent among frequency bands, and in the lowest frequencies (the audible range) the dynamic range is much greater ‚Äî over 100 dB. Noise Shaping is inherently built into the delta-sigma modulators. The 1 bit converter is the basis of the DSD format by Sony. One criticism of the 1 bit converter (and thus the DSD system) is that because only 1 bit is used in both the signal and the feedback loop, adequate amounts of dither cannot be used in the feedback loop and distortion can be heard under some conditions.S. Lipschitz and J. Vanderkooy, \\"Why Professional 1-Bit Sigma-Delta Conversion is a Bad Idea\\" AES 109th Convention, Sep 2000S. Lipschitz and J. Vanderkooy, \\"Why 1-Bit Sigma- Delta Conversion is Unsuitable for High-Quality Applications\\" AES 110th convention, May 2001 Most A/D converters made since 2000 use multi-bit or multi-level delta sigma modulators that yield more than 1 bit output so that proper dither can be added in the feedback loop. For traditional PCM sampling the signal is then decimated to 44.1 kHz or other appropriate sample rates. = In modern ADCs = Analog Devices uses what they refer to as \\"Noise Shaping Requantizer\\", and Texas Instruments uses what they refer to as \\"SNRBoost\\" to lower the noise floor approximately 30db compared to the surrounding frequencies. This comes at a cost of non-continuous operation but produces a nice bathtub shape to the spectrum floor. This can be combined with other techniques such as Bit-Boost to further enhance the resolution of the Spectrum. Texas Instruments explains \\"SNRBoost\\" in these Documents Using Windowing With SNRBoost3G Technology (PDF) and Understanding Low-Amplitude Behavior of 11-bit ADCs (PDF) while Analog Devices explains their \\"Noise Shaping Requantizer\\", in this Document AD6677 80 MHz Bandwidth IF Receiver (on Page 23).

distributor, founded by Bill Pence in 1977. Donald Krim bought Kino just months after its founding and served as president of the company until his death from cancer in 2011. Kino, based in New York City, specializes in art house films, such as low-budget current films, classic films from earlier periods in the history of cinema, and world cinema. Similar in many respects to The Criterion Collection, the home video releases by Kino are usually restored versions with substantial supplementary material. History Kino's theatrical arm handles theatrical distribution of much of the Janus Collection, and has a focus on recent art house and foreign films. Their non-theatrical arm has more of a focus on classic cinema, providing silent film classics which are otherwise difficult to find. They are the largest video distributor of silent films, including a great many from the earliest days of cinema (before 1914). These include important early landmark films by Thomas Edison, Georges M√©li√®s, the Lumi√®re brothers and D.W. Griffith. Many of those were restored by David Shepard's Film Preservation Associates. In 2009, Kino International merged with Lorber HT Digital to form Kino Lorber. Kino International remains that company's imprint for world cinema titles, as well as American independents, documentaries, international classics, and silent cinema. The other Kino Lorber imprints are Lorber Films, Alive Mind, and Knitting Factory Entertainment. Kino has also done releases of all of the cartoons in the Pink Panther cartoon series as well as its spinoffs, such as The Inspector and The Ant and the Aardvark.

Located along Front Street West, the hotel is situated at the southern end of the Financial District, in Downtown Toronto. The Royal York was designed by Ross and Macdonald, in association with Sproatt and Rolph, and built by the Canadian Pacific Railway company. The hotel is presently managed by Fairmont Hotels and Resorts. Opened on 11 June 1929, the Ch√¢teauesque-styled building is , and contains 28 floors. It is considered one of Canada's grand railway hotels. After its completion, the building was briefly the tallest building in Toronto, as well as the tallest building in the country, and the British Empire, until the nearby Canadian Bank of Commerce Tower was built the following year. The building has undergone several extensive renovations since it first opened, with its first major renovation in 1972. An underground walkway linking the hotel with the Royal Bank Plaza and Union Station form part of the Toronto's PATH underground city system. Location The main entrance to the Royal York Hotel is on Front Street West. The Royal York Hotel sits at 100 Front Street West at the southern end of the Financial District, a business district in Downtown Toronto. The hotel property is bounded by Piper Street to the north, and York Street to the west, whereas its eastern portion is bounded by Royal Bank Plaza, an office complex that serves as the operational headquarters of the Royal Bank of Canada. Union Station, the city's main intermodal transportation hub, is located south of the hotel, across Front Street West. The Royal York was not the first hotel built on the site. The first hotel was built in 1843 and was originally known as the Ontario Terrace. It consisted of four brick houses, and was later occupied by Knox College, a seminary. The former hotel was later demolished to make way for the Royal York. Located at the southern end of the Financial District, near Bay Street, the hotel is situated within Canada's financial centre. Its southerly location within the Financial District also places the hotel near several downtown neighbourhoods. Southwest of the Financial District is the Entertainment District, whereas the neighbourhoods of St. Lawrence and South Core are located to the east, and south of the Financial District. The hotel building forms a part of the Union Station Heritage Conservation District, a historic district surrounding Union Station. The creation of the historic district was through the Ontario Heritage Act, and was enacted by Toronto City Council on July 2006. Given its overlap with the Financial District, the historic district is an eclectic collection of buildings, with structures dating from the 1850s to the present day. Historic buildings within this district include the Dominion Public Building, and The Toronto Club. Design =Architecture= Shortly after acquiring the property, Canadian Pacific Hotels, a division of the Canadian Pacific Railway, announced its plan to demolish the Queen's Hotel in order to construct a new hotel. The building's was designed by a Canadian architectural firm, Ross and Macdonald, in association with Sproatt and Rolph. Both firms had designed buildings for Canadian Pacific Hotels prior to the Royal York Hotel. Edwardian style. The building design went through several drafts before its final draft, \\"H plan,\\" was adopted. The plan saw the development of a towering central element, in an effort to distinguish itself from the buildings of the nearby Eaton's Annex. The building's towering design also enabled most rooms and public spaces to face either the downtown core of the city, or the Toronto waterfront and Lake Ontario. Completed in 1929, the Ch√¢teauesque-styled hotel includes a row of pointed arches on the third story, and a small peaked roof with tiny dormers at the top of the pitched roof. In addition, grotesques shaped as griffins are present at various corners of the hotel. The building's exterior is made of Indiana Limestone, which encases the hotel's 28-story steel frame. Along with traditional features found on most Chateauesque-styled hotel, the building also incorporated an Art Deco setback and Romanesque-inspired decor. The balanced design of the building (prior to the addition of the east wing) was achieved through the application of semi-neoclassical motifs, and groups of arcaded windows. The interior of the building was largely created in an Edwardian architectural style. Its interior features a number of crystal chandeliers, and a hand-carved wood lobby ceiling. The building stands , containing 28 floors primarily made up of guest rooms and other hotel amenities. After the building's completion, it was briefly the tallest building in the British Empire, and Canada. The building would lose the record the following year, with the erection of the nearby Canadian Bank of Commerce Tower on King Street. Work to enlarge the hotel commenced in 1957, and was completed in 1959. The new east wing expansion was designed by the architecture firm Ross, Patterson, Townsend, & Fish, in association with Charles B. Dolphin. =Facilities= The Ballroom is an event space at the hotel which features an oil-painted ceiling. When the Royal York first opened, the hotel included 1,048 guest rooms and suites. When the hotel first opened, it featured a telephone switchboard longer than . As of 2014, the hotel expanded the number of its guest rooms and suites to 1,363. Types of guest rooms include Signature or Luxury, along with an array of eight types of suites. In addition to lodgings, the hotel offers a number of event spaces. The hotel features an entire floor of function rooms, primarily used for conferences. A notable room at the hotel includes the Ballroom, which features an oil-painted ceiling from the hotel's opening. The Concert Hall is another event space at the hotel that is outfitted with a Casavant Fr√®res pipe organ. With five manuals and one-hundred-and-seven stops, it was the largest pipe organ in Canada. Another notable event space within the hotel is the Imperial Room, which was once used as a nightclub from the 1940s to the 1990s. The space featured a stage at the north-end of the room, a sunken floor with tables and a dance floor in the middle, and raised booths at the other end of the room. The room is presently used as a meeting and event space, most often by the Empire Club of Canada. The Concert Hall is one of several event spaces at the Royal York Hotel. A number of rooms at the Royal York are also occupied by restaurants and other food-based services. The Royal York's kitchen was Canada's largest hotel kitchen when the Royal York first opened, capable of producing over 15,000 French bread rolls a day. Restaurants located within the hotel include Benihana Japanese Steakhouse, and the Library Bar, the latter also offering afternoon tea. The fourteenth floor of the Royal York houses the hotel's roof herb garden, which provides the hotel's restaurants with fresh honey, herbs, vegetable, and flowers. The roof garden was opened at the hotel on 12 June 1929. In June 2008, the hotel installed three beehives on its fourteenth-floor to serve as an in-house garden for its restaurants. The apiary presently has six beehives, and a pollinator bee hotel, installed in 2014. Approximately 350,000 honey bees reside at the apiary during the summer, with the six beehives producing of honey a year. The hotel also operates a health club, which offers a number of amenities including an indoor pool with a skylight, fitness centre, a whirlpool, sauna, and steam rooms. In 1929, a tunnel was built under Front Street West, in order to provide guests of the hotel with direct access to Union Station. The tunnel connecting the hotel to Union Station was later connected with the larger PATH underground city, a series of tunnels that connects various buildings in Downtown Toronto. In 1987, the city adopted the role as the coordinating agency for the tunnel network.  History  The Royal York Hotel was not the first hotel built on the property, with the first hotel being built in 1843, known originally as the Ontario Terrace. After the original hotel was refurbished in 1853, the building was renamed the Sword's Hotel, and then the Revere Hotel after a change in ownership in 1860. Thomas Dick bought the hotel back in 1862, renovated it again, and named it Queen's Hotel. In 1925, the Queen's Hotel was purchased by Thomas McGaw and Henry Winnett, hoteliers of Upper Canada, who also owned the Queen's Royal Hotel in Niagara on the Lake. View of the Royal York Hotel (left) in 1930, a year after its official opening. Winnett later acquired McGaw's interests in their hotels, however after Winnett's death in 1925, his estate sold the Queen's Hotel to the Canadian Pacific Railway (CPR), run by then-president Sir Edward Wentworth Beatty. Later, Canadian Pacific announced its intention to demolish the Queen's Hotel to build the largest hotel in the British Commonwealth on its site. Prior to its demolition, the Queen's Hotel was billed as \\"One of the largest and most comfortable hotels in the Dominion of Canada.\\" Construction on the new hotel began in 1927, and was completed in 1929. Named the Royal York, the new hotel cost $16 million when built. The completed hotel featured over 1,000 guest rooms, each equipped with radios, private showers, and bathtubs, a library, a 12-bed hospital, and a telephone switchboard. The hotel also operated St. George's Golf and Country Club as the Royal York Golf Club from 1930 to 1946, when the hotel's parent company, Canadian Pacific Railway, divested themselves from the golf course property. The building was officially opened on 11 June 1929 by The Viscount Willingdon, the Governor General of Canada, in \\"one of the most glittering social events in Toronto's history.\\" The Toronto Board of Trade hosted a luncheon in the hotel's banquet hall for E.W. Beatty and the board of directors of the Canadian Pacific Railway. After the luncheon, the Governor- General registered as the first guest of the hotel. During the afternoon, guides showed guests around the hotel. The day finished off with an opening ball at 9 PM (with over 2300 people attending ). Several politicians and other notable people from the USA and Canada attended the opening of the hotel. The opening of the hotel was front page news in the Montreal Gazette on 12 June 1929. The hotel had 19,800 square feet of Canadian linoleum flooring upon opening. The east wing of the Royal York was completed in 1959. From 1930 to 1935, a radio station operated from the hotel. Its call letters were CPRY (for \\"Canadian Pacific Royal York\\"). Broadcasting from the Imperial Room, CPRY programs were heard across the country. On 7 September 1949, the lobby of the hotel was converted into a temporary field hospital following a fire on the cruise ship SS Noronic. Docked in the Toronto harbour, the disaster on the Noronic killed 118 people. From the 1940s to the 1990s, the hotel operated a nightclub known as the Imperial Room. It attracted top musicians and performers to the hotel from the 1940s to the 1990s, including Anne Murray, Buddy Rich, Count Basie, Doug Henning, Duke Ellington, Eartha Kitt, Ella Fitzgerald, Louis Armstrong, Marlene Dietrich, Pearl Bailey, Peggy Lee, Rich Little, Tina Turner, Tony Bennett, and Woody Herman. The Imperial Room was also where Jim Carrey made his comedic stage debut. The nightclub was later converted to an event space. The Royal York became a centre of political controversy during the 1955 Toronto municipal election, when it was revealed that the incumbent mayor, Allan A. Lamport, had spent taxpayers' money maintaining a private suite at the hotel for private meetings and cocktail parties. Work to enlarge the hotel with a new east wing commenced in 1957, and was completed in 1959. Renovations in 1972 and 1973 saw the addition of wood panels and a spiral staircase to hotel's lobby. The hotel underwent an extensive renovation program in 1972 and 1973 to modernize its image. Called the Royal York Revelation, the program was overseen by the architects Webb Zerafa Menkes Housden (who also designed the Royal Bank plaza next to the hotel). The renovation cut a hole in the main-floor lobby for a spiral staircase, covered the marble pillars in the lobby with wood panelling, hung modern wall lamps and a chandelier and replaced rugs with carpet. From 1988 until 1993, the Royal York underwent a $100-million restoration. In 2001, the company which owns the hotel, Canadian Pacific Hotels, was reorganized into Fairmont Hotels and Resorts, adopting the name from an American company it had purchased in 1999. As a result of the company's re-brand, the Royal York was renamed the \\"Fairmont Royal York.\\" In 2007 the Royal York, along with a number of other Fairmont properties, were sold to Ivanho√© Cambridge, although Fairmont continues to manage the hotel. The official welcome and reception for the leaders of the 2010 G20 Toronto summit was held at the Royal York Hotel on 26 June 2010. Due to its usage, the hotel was included in the Royal Canadian Mounted Police's designated security zones for the G20 summit. On 28 October 2014, it was announced the hotel's ownership was reorganized. In In a joint venture, KingSett Capital Inc. and InnVest Real Estate purchased 80 percent of the Royal York property from Ivanho√© Cambridge in 2014. As the venture's managing partner KingSett acquired a 60 percent share of the Royal York property, whereas InnVest acquired a 20 percent share of the property. Ivanho√© Cambridge maintained a 20 percent stake in the property's ownership. Following the sale of the hotel, its new owners announced a C$50-million renovation of the hotel. Notable guests Security fence erected for the 2010 G20 Toronto summit. The hotel housed many of the 2010 G20 dignitaries. A number of notable guests have stayed at the Royal York. The hotel frequently serves as a three- to-four-month home for members of the film industry, or newcomers to the adjacent financial core. The Royal York is also used as a host hotel for the Toronto International Film Festival, making it a popular residence during the film festival. Celebrity guests who have visited the hotel include Andrew Lloyd Webber, Ashley and Mary Kate Olsen, Jennifer Aniston, Jennifer Garner, Justin Bieber, Leonardo DiCaprio, Matt Damon, and Susan Sarandon. The hotel keeps records of its guests' preferences in order to best accommodate them. Employees of the hotel are forbidden from carrying cell phones, tweeting or sharing information on social media about the guests at the hotel. A number of heads of state, diplomats, and other foreign dignitaries have also stayed at the Royal York. During the 2010 G20 Toronto summit, the hotel housed eleven heads of state and heads of government. Heads of state that have stayed at the hotel include Nicolas Sarkozy, the President of France, and Ronald Reagan, the President of the United States. Other foreign dignitaries that have stayed at the Royal York include American Senator Robert F. Kennedy, and the 14th Dalai Lama. =Royal Family= Queen Elizabeth II and Prince Philip, Duke of Edinburgh at the Royal York during their 2010 royal tour. The hotel has been the residence of choice for Queen Elizabeth II and other members of the Canadian Royal Family when in Toronto. Elizabeth II first visited the Royal York Hotel during her 1951 royal tour of the country, accompanied by Prince Philip. The first members of the Royal Family to visit the hotel was King George VI and Queen Elizabeth during their 1939 royal tour of Canada. Other members of the Royal Family that have visited the Royal York include Prince Andrew, Duke of York; Charles, Prince of Wales; Camilla, Duchess of Cornwall; Prince Harry, Duke of Sussex; and Meghan, Duchess of Sussex. The Queen usually has an entire floor reserved for her and her entourage, occupying the Royal Suite herself. The floors above and below the Royal Suite are vacated two weeks prior to the Queen's arrival, and remain that way until her departure. The hotel includes amenities and furnishings reserved exclusively for the Royal Family, including a private elevator to the Royal Suite. Furniture and hardware reserved for the Royal Family, including mattresses, and toilets, are placed in storage when not in use. The clock in the main lobby was donated to the Royal York Hotel from the Royal Family.

Such a segment can be a phoneme, a word, a grammatical phrase, a sentence, or an event within a larger narrative structure, depending on the level of analysis. Syntagmatic analysis involves the study of relationships (rules of combination) among syntagmas. At the lexical level, syntagmatic structure in a language is the combination of words according to the rules of syntax for that language. For example, English uses determiner + adjective + noun, e.g. the big house. Another language might use determiner + noun + adjective (Spanish ) and therefore have a different syntagmatic structure. At a higher level, narrative structures feature a realistic temporal flow guided by tension and relaxation; thus, for example, events or rhetorical figures may be treated as syntagmas of epic structures. Syntagmatic structure is often contrasted with paradigmatic structure. In semiotics, \\"syntagmatic analysis\\" is analysis of syntax or surface structure (syntagmatic structure), rather than paradigms as in paradigmatic analysis. Analysis is often achieved through commutation tests. See also *Ferdinand de Saussure Notes Sources *Middleton, Richard (1990/2002). Studying Popular Music.

A weak probe normally experiences absorption shown in blue. A second coupling beam induces EIT and creates a \\"window\\" in the absorption region (red). This plot is a computer simulation of EIT in an InAs/GaAs quantum dot Electromagnetically induced transparency (EIT) is a coherent optical nonlinearity which renders a medium transparent within a narrow spectral range around an absorption line. Extreme dispersion is also created within this transparency \\"window\\" which leads to \\"slow light\\", described below. It is in essence a quantum interference effect that permits the propagation of light through an otherwise opaque atomic medium. Observation of EIT involves two optical fields (highly coherent light sources, such as lasers) which are tuned to interact with three quantum states of a material. The \\"probe\\" field is tuned near resonance between two of the states and measures the absorption spectrum of the transition. A much stronger \\"coupling\\" field is tuned near resonance at a different transition. If the states are selected properly, the presence of the coupling field will create a spectral \\"window\\" of transparency which will be detected by the probe. The coupling laser is sometimes referred to as the \\"control\\" or \\"pump\\", the latter in analogy to incoherent optical nonlinearities such as spectral hole burning or saturation. EIT is based on the destructive interference of the transition probability amplitude between atomic states. Closely related to EIT are coherent population trapping (CPT) phenomena. The quantum interference in EIT can be exploited to laser cool atomic particles, even down to the quantum mechanical ground state of motion. This was used in 2015 to directly image individual atoms trapped in an optical lattice.  Medium requirements  EIT level schemes can be sorted into three categories; vee, ladder, and lambda. There are specific restrictions on the configuration of the three states. Two of the three possible transitions between the states must be \\"dipole allowed\\", i.e. the transitions can be induced by an oscillating electric field. The third transition must be \\"dipole forbidden.\\" One of the three states is connected to the other two by the two optical fields. The three types of EIT schemes are differentiated by the energy differences between this state and the other two. The schemes are the ladder, vee, and lambda. Any real material system may contain many triplets of states which could theoretically support EIT, but there are several practical limitations on which levels can actually be used. Also important are the dephasing rates of the individual states. In any real system at non-zero temperature there are processes which cause a scrambling of the phase of the quantum states. In the gas phase, this means usually collisions. In solids, dephasing is due to interaction of the electronic states with the host lattice. The dephasing of state 3\\\\rangle is especially important; ideally 3\\\\rangle should be a robust, metastable state. Currently EIT research uses atomic systems in dilute gases, solid solutions, or more exotic states such as Bose‚ÄìEinstein condensate. EIT has been demonstrated in electromechanical and optomechanical systems, where it is known as optomechanically induced transparency. Work is also being done in semiconductor nanostructures such as quantum wells , quantum wires and quantum dots.  Theory  EIT was first proposed theoretically by professor Jakob Khanin and graduate student Olga Kocharovskaya at Gorky State University (renamed to Nizhny Novgorod in 1990), Russia; there are now several different approaches to a theoretical treatment of EIT. One approach is to extend the density matrix treatment used to derive Rabi oscillation of a two-state, single field system. In this picture the probability amplitude for the system to transfer between states can interfere destructively, preventing absorption. In this context, \\"interference\\" refers to interference between quantum events (transitions) and not optical interference of any kind. As a specific example, consider the lambda scheme shown above. Absorption of the probe is defined by transition from 1\\\\rangle to 2\\\\rangle. The fields can drive population from 1\\\\rangle-2\\\\rangle directly or from 1\\\\rangle-2\\\\rangle-3\\\\rangle-2\\\\rangle. The probability amplitudes for the different paths interfere destructively. If 3\\\\rangle has a comparatively long lifetime, then the result will be a transparent window completely inside of the 1\\\\rangle-2\\\\rangle absorption line. Another approach is the \\"dressed state\\" picture, wherein the system + coupling field Hamiltonian is diagonalized and the effect on the probe is calculated in the new basis. In this picture EIT resembles a combination of Autler-Townes splitting and Fano interference between the dressed states. Between the doublet peaks, in the center of the transparency window, the quantum probability amplitudes for the probe to cause a transition to either state cancel. A polariton picture is particularly important in describing stopped light schemes. Here, the photons of the probe are coherently \\"transformed\\" into \\"dark state polaritons\\" which are excitations of the medium. These excitations exist (or can be \\"stored\\") for a length of time dependent only on the dephasing rates.  Slow light and stopped light Rapid change of index of refraction (blue) in a region of rapidly changing absorption (gray) associated with EIT. The steep and _positive_ linear region of the refractive index in the center of the transparency window gives rise to slow light It is important to realize that EIT is only one of many diverse mechanisms which can produce slow light. The Kramers‚ÄìKronig relations dictate that a change in absorption (or gain) over a narrow spectral range must be accompanied by a change in refractive index over a similarly narrow region. This rapid and positive change in refractive index produces an extremely low group velocity. The first experimental observation of the low group velocity produced by EIT was by Boller, ƒ∞mamoƒülu, and Harris at Stanford University in 1991 in strontium. In 1999 Lene Hau reported slowing light in a medium of ultracold sodium atoms, achieving this by using quantum interference effects responsible for electromagnetically induced transparency (EIT). Her group performed copious research regarding EIT with Stephen E. Harris. \\"Using detailed numerical simulations, and analytical theory, we study properties of micro-cavities which incorporate materials that exhibit Electro-magnetically Induced Transparency (EIT) or Ultra Slow Light (USL). We find that such systems, while being miniature in size (order wavelength), and integrable, can have some outstanding properties. In particular, they could have lifetimes orders of magnitude longer than other existing systems, and could exhibit non- linear all-optical switching at single photon power levels. Potential applications include miniature atomic clocks, and all-optical quantum information processing.\\" The current record for slow light in an EIT medium is held by Budker, Kimball, Rochester, and Yashchuk at U.C. Berkeley in 1999. Group velocities as low as 8 m/s were measured in a warm thermal rubidium vapor. Stopped light, in the context of an EIT medium, refers to the coherent transfer of photons to the quantum system and back again. In principle, this involves switching off the coupling beam in an adiabatic fashion while the probe pulse is still inside of the EIT medium. There is experimental evidence of trapped pulses in EIT medium. In authors created a stationary light pulse inside the atomic coherent media. In 2009 researchers from Harvard University and MIT demonstrated a few-photon optical switch for quantum optics based on the slow light ideas. Lene Hau and a team from Harvard University were the first to demonstrate stopped light.

(known as ¬°Mucha Lucha!: Gigante during its third season) is a 2002‚Äì2005 Mexican-American animated television series that premiered on Kids' WB on August 17, 2002. It was created by Eddie Mort and Lili Chin and produced by Warner Bros. Animation. It is the first animated television series intended for children created with Adobe Flash, a program which became widely used as a medium for animation in the years following. In 2005, the direct-to-video feature film ¬°Mucha Lucha!: The Return of El Mal√©fico was spun-off from the series. The show also contained music by Michael Tavera, who previously made music for Cartoon Network's Time Squad. Premise The show is set in Luchaville, a fictional town in Southern California centered on lucha libre where nearly everyone in that town wears a mask (which they are never seen without) and costume and a signature move. The series mainly focuses on three friends, Rikochet, Buena Girl, and the Flea, as they struggle through the Foremost World-Renowned International School of Lucha, where they study. Episodes Characters * Rikochet ‚Äì A young wrestler who is the protagonist. He considers himself the bravest of the group, but sometimes leaps before he looks. * Buena Girl ‚Äì A smart, young female wrestler who always plays by the rules. She can also be very arrogant and obnoxious at times. * The Flea ‚Äì A friend of Rikochet and Buena Girl who is always dirty and refers to himself in third person. As well as having a few disgusting habits, he is also the most nervous, but often proves to be a useful ally. * El Rey ‚Äì An action figure which represents Rikochet's conscience. He's carried in a backpack, but can move and talk on his own, as if he were alive. It is stated that this action figure is just part of a large merchandising euphoria related to a supreme undefeated Mexican wrestler with the same name (an allusion to Santo). Along in the series, several other El Rey toys appear and often causes trouble with Rikochet's. Broadcast The show was also seen on Teletoon in Canada, CITV, Pop Max and Disney XD in the United Kingdom, Nine Network in Australia and Cartoon Network worldwide (including the United States). Home media In Region 1, Warner Home Video has released one compilation that contained the first six segment-episodes from season one, titled Heart of Lucha, on August 19, 2003. The direct-to-video movie The Return of El Mal√©fico, was released on January 4, 2005 during the third and final season. In 2019, ¬°Mucha Lucha! was available remastered for the first time in High Definition for home viewers and became available on demand through Amazon Prime. Merchandise A toy line based on the show was released by Jakks Pacific in 2004. In this toy line included \\"Mix-a-Lot\\" action figures; these had removable body parts that could be placed on the bodies of other action figures in the series. \\"Signature Move\\" action figures were also put out, along with a toy wrestling ring. However, the second series of the toy line was cancelled. During summer of 2003, DC Comics published a three-issue mini-series of comic books based on ¬°Mucha Lucha! All three of the stories featured in these comic books were written by Eddie Mort, and have even been occasionally referenced in the TV series. # El Rey, Come Home! # It's All Buena! # Limbo of the Lost Luchadores! The show was licensed for a Game Boy Advance video game, Mascaritas of the Lost Code, in late 2003, and also a Sony PlayStation 2 video game, Mysterioso Grande, was slated for release, but was cancelled around 2004 as the creators could not find a publisher. Proposed revival In 2014, a revival called ¬°Mucha Lucha! Para Siempre was proposed which would have focused on Rikochet, Buena Girl, and the Flea as teenagers.https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LjAXpxv4joohttps://muchalucha- art.tumblr.com/post/122013214348/will-there-be-more-mucha-lucha-well-were- stillhttps://muchalucha-art.tumblr.com/page/3 See also * Lucha libre (Mexican wrestling) * El Santo * Chicos de Barrio References External links  Category:Lucha libre Category:2002 American television series debuts Category:2005 American television series endings Category:2000s American animated television series Category:American children's animated adventure television series Category:American children's animated comedy television series Category:American children's animated fantasy television series Category:American children's animated action television series Category:American children's animated sports television series Category:American flash animated television series Category:Warner Bros.

The flicker fixer accomplishes this by adjusting the timing of the natively interlaced video signal to suit the needs of a progressive display Ex: CRT computer monitor. Flicker fixers in essence create a progressive frame of video from two interlaced fields of video. Flicker fixers sample the NTSC/PAL output from the output device and store each scan line from the field currently being displayed in RAM while simultaneously outputting the line alternately with the corresponding neighboring lines from the field stored previously (weaving). Some more advanced flicker fixers integrated in add-on graphics cards use more sophisticated methods. Outputting the image at double scan rate essentially composes a progressive display with all lines from both fields at full vertical refresh rate. This promotes the horizontal frequency of the signal from 15.734 kHz to 31.47 kHz (in the NTSC case, numbers for PAL are slightly lower), which can be the used to drive a VGA monitor from an output device.  Use with the Commodore Amiga  One computer capable of producing an interlaced image is the Commodore Amiga. The Amiga's default video mode is PAL or NTSC. NTSC and PAL interlaced screens have two fields called odd and even. The fields switch every 60th of a second on NTSC, or 50th of a second on PAL, which allows for higher resolution while using a narrower signal bandwidth than full 50 or 60 FPS progressive video would require, but it can also produce an alarming jittering effect for graphics with high contrast details between fields. This NTSC/PAL compatibility gave the Amiga a distinct edge in uses such as television production and gaming, but since the original Amigas were unable to produce vertically high-resolution displays without flickering this was unsuitable for office-like usage where one might need to work with a clear high-resolution image for several hours. Flicker fixers were devised to remedy this. The later iteration of the Amiga - the Amiga 3000 had a custom chip called Amber which could perform flicker-fixing on any signal. The ECS and AGA chipset could also output VGA display modes. Commodore offered the A2320 Display Enhancer Board for this purpose, The board fit neatly in a video graphics adapter slot on the A2000 series computer. It supported the new video modes offered by the Enhanced Chip Set (ECS) and AmigaOS 2.0, including the Productivity Mode.

Ghostbusters universe. First depicted in the film Ghostbusters, it has a hand-held wand (\\"Neutrona Wand\\" or particle thrower) connected to a backpack-sized particle accelerator. It fires a stream of highly focused and radially polarized protons that electrostatically traps the negatively charged energy of a ghost, allowing it to be held in the stream. In the Ghostbusters universe The proton pack, designed by Dr. Egon Spengler, is a man-portable particle accelerator system that is used to create a charged particle beam‚Äîcomposed of protons‚Äîthat is fired by the particle thrower (also referred to as the \\"neutrona wand\\"). Described in the first movie as a \\"positron collider\\", it functions by colliding high-energy positrons to generate its proton beam. The beam allows a Ghostbuster to contain and hold \\"negatively charged ectoplasmic entities\\". This containment ability allows the wielder to position a ghost above a trap for capture. The name proton pack is not used in the original movie at all, and is not used until the subway tunnel scene in Ghostbusters II, when Egon says that they should get their proton packs. The doorman to the Mayor's mansion also uses the term proton pack, asking the Ghostbusters if he can buy one from them for his little brother. Egon replies that \\"A proton pack is not a toy\\". In the 1984 novelization of Ghostbusters the Proton Packs are mention eg. ‚ÄúStantz hauls out the formidable weaponry from the back of the Ectomobile and the four men kit themselves up, buckling on their proton packs‚Ä¶‚Äù\\"Ghostbusters - A novel based on the screenplay by Dan Aykroyd and Harold Raims\\" by Larry Milne. Cornet 1984. While the Ghostbusters' dialogue indicates that the accelerator system operates similarly to a cyclotron (and indeed Dr. Peter Venkman refers to the proton packs in one scene as \\"unlicensed nuclear accelerators\\"), modern particle accelerators produce well collimated particle beams.Particle accelerator This is far different from the beam from a proton pack, which tends to undulate wildly (though it still stays within the general area at which the user is aiming). The proton stream is quite destructive to physical objects, and can cause extensive property damage. In the 2009 Ghostbusters game, Ray explains how the proton pack works early in the game; the energy emitted by the proton stream helps to dissipate psychokinetic (PK) energy which ghosts use to manifest themselves. Draining them of their PK energy weakens them, allowing them to be captured in their portable ghost traps. According to a line spoken by Egon in Ghostbusters II, each pack's energy cell has a half-life of 5,000 years. Knobs on the main stock of the proton pack can perform various functions to customize the proton stream, including adjustments for stream intensity, length, and degrees of polarization. In the cartoon series The Real Ghostbusters, the maximum power setting for the proton packs is \\"500,000 MHz,\\" which possibly refers to the rate of positron collisions occurring within the pack's accelerator system. In the cartoon the packs also have a self-destruct mechanism capable of affecting at least a half-mile radius. The Real Ghostbusters also made proton packs less efficient with power cells, allowing them to run out of energy when appropriate for dramatic tension. For the 1997 animated spinoff Extreme Ghostbusters, the proton packs and ghost traps are redesigned to combat the threat of the malevolent Achira, an ancient disease-provoking entity accidentally released by workers constructing a new subway tunnel. Egon, with the help of Roland, Kylie and Eduardo, increased the proton packs' nuclear capability (to deal with Achira and other subsequent enemies, much stronger than what the original Ghostbusters had faced) and modified the power system; now, the packs required replaceable proton canisters to be loaded in for them to function. The trap was redesigned as well, into a gold-colored, round-shaped device with an opening hatch atop it. Kylie would typically carry it; due to this, she did not carry a normal proton pack, instead carrying a not-as-powerful proton pistol. The IDW monthly Ghostbusters comic storyline has shown the movie pack, a boson dart capable pack and the Extreme Ghostbusters pack in use. The IDW comic also shows a proton pistol attachment to the movie pack being used by Winston while hunting down Slimer. =Crossing the streams= Crossing the streams was initially discouraged, as Egon believed that \\"total protonic reversal\\" would occur: this effect would have catastrophic results (see quote above). However, in a desperate effort to stop the powerful Gozer the Gozerian, Egon noted that the door to Gozer's temple \\"swings both ways\\" and that by crossing the streams, they may be able to create enough force to close the door on Gozer and its control. As the Ghostbusters cross the streams, the combination of that much energy closes the door to Gozer's dimension and severs its ties to our world. The resulting blast destroys a good portion of the roof and blows up the Stay Puft Marshmallow Man. In Ghostbusters: The Video Game, the Ghostbusters mention that \\"crossing the streams\\" during the Gozer Incident (events of the first Ghostbusters film) only worked due to the presence of a cross-dimension portal (a tactic which is referred to as the \\"Gozer gambit\\" by Ray) and should only be used as a last resort. During the game's climax, the Ghostbusters are pulled into Ivo Shandor's ghostly realm and come face-to-face with Shandor's Destructor form, forcing them to resort to \\"crossing the streams\\" to defeat Shandor. The resulting blast not only destroys Shandor but also sends the team flying back to their dimension. During gameplay, it is possible for the player to cross the streams with another Ghostbuster, but this will only cause a burst of energy to travel down the stream and deal a massive amount of damage to the player, also knocking them off their feet for a short time, due to a new \\"safety\\" that was installed on the neutrona wand. In Ghostbusters: The Video Game The game features a modified version of the proton pack (an experimental prototype) which is given to the player (the Ghostbuster's new experimental equipment technician/guinea pig) for field testing. This new proton pack is equipped with other features (and upgrades) besides the standard proton stream. As props in the real world The props representing proton packs were originally thought to have been made by the prop department of Columbia Pictures. Recent information coming from the auction of a hero proton pack in July 2012 revealed that the hero proton packs could have been made by Boss Film Studios, a prop studio started by ILM veteran Richard Edlund. They are made of molded fiberglass shells on aluminium backplates (or \\"motherboards\\") bolted to military surplus A.L.I.C.E. frames. The basic shape was sculpted from foam; later, a rubber mold was made of it, from which fiberglass shells were pulled. The \\"wand\\" had an extending barrel mechanism and the electronics were quite advanced for the time. They were then finished with various surplus 1960s resistors, pneumatic fittings, hoses and ribbon cable, and surplus warning labels and custom-made metal fittings. The overall weight of these props is said to be around . These \\"hero\\" props were substituted in stunt scenes by flimsy foam rubber pulls from the same mould. The proton packs have a lightbar with 15 blue scrolling lights in a box on the left-hand side and 4 red lights in the circular \\"cyclotron\\" portion of the bottom of the prop that light up in rotation. The \\"wand\\" also featured numerous light features; the most elaborate versions had fluorescent bargraphs, incandescent bulbs, and strobing flashes in the tip for the visual effects crew to synchronize the 'streams' to. The GB1 Hero proton packs were fiberglass shells mounted on aluminum motherboards with LC-1 ALICE Frames and straps. These packs had many aluminum parts on them, including: aluminum Ion Arm and cap, booster tube, injector tubes, HGA, vacuum line, PPD, Beamline and filler tube, as well as the N-Filter. The wands for these packs were also fully aluminum, minus the resin grips. All these external parts were pop riveted to the shell, which was then, in turn, mounted to the motherboard via L-Brackets and bolts at the four corners of the pack. The GB1 stunt packs were packs that were cast in foam to be worn during physical stunts performed in the film. Many of the attached pieces of the hero packs are cast on to these packs in foam. These packs also featured static lights and were attached to plywood motherboards with different straps compared to the GB1 heroes. Other than the bumper, wand and hosing/ribbon cable, everything was cast into the foam shell of the pack. Some packs from Ghostbusters were used in the follow- up Ghostbusters II; these packs were slightly redressed with a black crank knob and thinner ribbon cable. The angle of the gun, or \\"wand\\" mount was changed to pitch forward slightly, in order to make the prop easier for the actor to use. In addition to these redressed props, one of the originals was hastily cast as a buck to produce basic lightweight \\"midgrade\\" props (as a solution to complaints by the actors about the weight of the original prop). These midgrade pieces featured many details cast in as part of the mould, instead of separate fittings. The electronics and mechanisms were also cut down greatly, reducing the total weight. The original GB1 props would appear in close-ups, the midgrade in all other scenes, and new rubber \\"stunt\\" packs were made for whenever the actor needed to take a fall. The proton pack props from the Ghostbusters movies are some of the most wanted and collectible props ever made. Several GB2 packs have surfaced for auction. In September 2004, one rubber stunt and one fiberglass midgrade prop were auctioned by Profiles in History. The midgrade prop fetched well over $13,000. The \\"semi-hero\\" pack, affectionately known as \\"Number Four\\", was bought from the auction winner by Ken Heugel for cash and a Sean Bishop replica pack. The auction winner kept the Certificate of Authenticity. The \\"Number 4\\" pack was dissected and documented by Bishop and Heugel. The examination revealed much of the hurried and shoddy casting and assembly techniques used in its creation. The measurements of the proton pack taken during the examination are still used today by prop builders making their own proton packs. Unfortunately, \\"Number 4\\" was lost in 2005 during Heugel's move to Romania. The case that held the pack arrived in Romania empty. This theft was classified as \\"an airline baggage mishap\\". In July 2006, another Ghostbusters II mid-grade \\"semi-hero\\" pack with a Certificate of Authenticity was placed on auction by Profiles in History. This proton pack was later pulled when it was determined to be the Bishop replica pack matched with the real Certificate of Authenticity of the \\"Number 4\\". This replica pack is distinct for its unusually rusty paint job. In 2011 this pack was recovered when author Ernie Cline (Fanboys, Ready Player One) purchased it, returning it to Bishop's shop for a makeover prior to Cline's use of it on his 2011-2012 book signing tour. All three variations of the GB2 pack have been displayed at various Planet Hollywood restaurants around the U.S. The Hero packs in GB2 were the same hero packs from GB1 but retrofitted so they had matching parts with the new packs they had to construct for filming. For all intents and purposes, these packs are built the same way, only with some cosmetic differences, such as different ribbon cables, different colored crank knob, the use of nycoil banjos on the wands, etc. Other than that, they are just beat up versions of their former selves from the first film. Here are some obvious and subtle modifications done to the hero packs for GB2: # The unique ribbon cable was replaced with regular Spectra Strip cable. # The grey crank knobs were replaced with black ones (or simply painted). # The V-hook on the gun mount was slightly angled forward on some packs (for ease of drawing). # The LC-1 A.L.I.C.E. frames were replaced with LC-2 versions (painted black). # Extra padding (commonly called \\"Super Straps\\") was added to the straps on some A.L.I.C.E. frames. # The Legris banjos on the Neutrona Wand were replaced with Nycoil banjos. # The packs were heavily weathered (not sure how intentional that was, though). # The Ion Arm Cap was heavily weathered on most packs (this is useful in identifying different packs). # The Ion Arm Rods were stripped of their black paint. # The square Clippard elbow on the Ion Arm Cap was removed, and a hex elbow was installed on the Ion Arm itself. # All the GB1 tubing was Clippard brand - GB2 used Nycoil and some Clippard. # The socket head cap screws connecting the shell to the mother board were replaced with button head cap screws. # The mesh inside of the N-filter was replaced with a white covering. The Semi-Hero packs in GB2 were a new addition to the packs used in filming. These packs were stripped-down versions of the heroes, merging constructional concepts from both the heroes and the stunt packs into a mid grade pack for wide shots. These packs were also constructed lighter for the actors. many of the metal parts from the Hero packs were cast in resin and attached to the shell, such as the HGA, injector tubes, beamline and filler tube. Other metal parts, such as the Ion Arm, Booster Tube (and frame), PPD, and N-Filter, were actually cast into the shell, much like the foam stunt packs from the first film. These packs also had fiberglass cast wands, instead of the metal ones from the first film. The GB2 foam stunt packs seem to have been built somewhat better than the GB1 foam stunt packs. The foam packs seem to be constructed the same way as the semi-heroes but instead of being cast as fiberglass, they were cast in foam instead. Once again, the Ion Arm, Booster Tube (and frame), PPD and N-Filter were cast onto the shell and part of the mold. Besides the video game, there is one more instance of Columbia/Sony having packs produced for production. That would be the packs made for the Universal Studios Florida stage show. As to how much lineage these packs actually have is still up in the air. If the master for these mold was retooled from a production mold, it was heavily modified. There is much extra material added around the EDA, both where the beamline and filler tubes go, as well as between the injector tubes and the EDA. At least the bottom half of the Booster tube and frame are cast into the shell as well as the N-Filter. There also seems to be much warpage at this point. These packs were also mounted on what seems like MDF motherboards and LC-2 ALICE frames. The proton pack worn by Bill Murray during his acceptance speech at the 2010 Scream Awards was a reproduction semi-hero pack made by Bishop.GBFans Forum: Bill Murray attends Scream Awards, sets internet aflame Retrieved 31 December 2011. In July 2012, Profiles in History auctioned a Ghostbusters hero pack. This proton pack was reportedly worn by Harold Ramis. The source of the pack is suspected to be Sony. This \\"Harold Pack\\" shows some modifications made to the hero packs from Ghostbusters to Ghostbusters II. The Harold Pack also showed some damaged and missing parts, most notably a missing crank knob and a broken N-Filter. There is also a clear tube from the Ghostbusters uniform shown with the Harold Pack. It is unknown if the electronics inside the pack are in working order. The \\"Harold Pack\\" sold for $130,000. The same Profiles in History auction also features the Ghostbusters ghost trap and pedal used when Slimer is captured in the hotel ballroom. This \\"Slimer Trap\\" is supposed to have a working pedal mechanism, but the operational status is also unknown. The \\"Slimer Trap\\" sold for $60,000. Many movie prop replica communities (prop forums) have sprung up regarding proton pack research and contain various methods and plans for constructing a replica proton pack. Plans, methods, parts and advice can be obtained from the members of these prop forums to help build a proton pack out of simple cardboard to movie accurate aluminum and fiberglass (shell) hero- pack replicas. Some of the more complex proton pack replicas being built have with lights and sound. These prop forums also have information on other Ghostbusters props from the ghost trap, to the slime blower, to the Ectomobile. Some of these prop forums also have members that sell replica shells, motherboards and other parts necessary to make a replica proton pack. Early script descriptions of the proton pack stated each pack had two neutrino wands, strapped to the wrists, rather than one held in a fashion similar to an assault rifle. Toy proton packs were formerly made by Kenner and became available in toy shops. They consisted of a plastic hollow pack and gun, with a yellow foam cylinder attached to the front of the gun to represent the beam.

A Christmas stamp is a postage stamp with a Christmas theme, intended for use on seasonal mail such as Christmas cards. Many countries of the world issue such stamps, which are regular postage stamps (in contrast to Christmas seals) and are usually valid for postage year-round (in some countries they have a discounted value and are for use exclusively on Christmas cards). They usually go on sale some time between early October and early December, and are printed in considerable quantities. History British Troops in Egypt Christmas stamp, 1935 Hungarian nativity stamp, 1943 First Christmas stamp of Australia, 1957 It is a matter of some debate as to which was the first Christmas stamp. The Canadian map stamp of 1898 bears an inscription \\"XMAS 1898\\", but it was actually issued to mark the inauguration of the Imperial Penny Postage rate. The Christmas connection has long been reported to have been the result of quick thinking; William Mulock was proposing that it be issued on 9 November, to \\"honor the Prince\\" (meaning the Prince of Wales), but when Queen Victoria asked \\"what Prince?\\" in a displeased manner, Mulock realized the danger, and answered \\"Why, madam, the Prince of Peace.\\" In 1935, British Forces troops stationed in Egypt were issued with a Christmas stamp for their mail home. For many years these were not included in the Stanley Gibbons catalogues, as they classified them as a ‚Äúseal‚Äù rather than a postage stamp, but they have been properly included since the mid-1960s as they prepaid postage and so, despite the inscription \\"Letter stamp\\", are normal stamps, and should therefore be counted as the first stamp issued expressly to mark Christmas. Like the slightly earlier Silver Jubilee overprints on the ‚Äúsphinx‚Äù stamp, the Christmas stamps were issued in booklet form in panes of 20.http://www.gbos.org.uk/index.php/Country_List/13 www.gbos.org.uk In 1937, Austria issued two \\"Christmas greeting stamps\\" featuring a rose and zodiac signs. In 1939, Brazil issued four semi-postal stamps with designs featuring the three kings and a star, an angel and child, the Southern Cross and a child, and a mother and child. In 1941 Hungary also issued a semi-postal whose additional fees were to pay for \\"soldiers' Christmas\\". The first stamps to depict the Nativity were the Hungary issue of 1943. These were all one-time issues, more like commemorative stamps than regular issues. The next Christmas stamps did not appear until 1951, when Cuba issued designs with poinsettias and bells, followed by Haiti (1954), Luxembourg and Spain (1955), then Australia, Korea, and Liechtenstein (1957). In cases such as Australia, the issuance marked the first of what became an annual tradition. Many more nations took up the practice during the 1960s, including the United States (1962) and United Kingdom (1966). By the 1990s, approximately 160 postal administrations were issuing Christmas stamps, mostly on an annual basis. Islamic countries constitute the largest group of non- participants, although the Palestinian Authority has issued Christmas stamps since 1995. Designs Peru's 1970 stamps reproduced paintings by anonymous Peruvian artists. Although some tropical islands produce large-format Christmas stamps primarily intended for sale to stamp collectors, for the rest of the world, Christmas stamps are \\"working stamps\\" that will be used in large numbers to send greeting cards and postcards. Accordingly, the stamps tend to be normal-sized, and offered in one or a few denominations, for instance to cover differing domestic and international rates. The choice of designs is highly variable, ranging from an overtly religious image of the Nativity, to secular images of Christmas trees, wreaths, Santa Claus, and so forth. A country may maintain a unified theme for several years, then change it drastically, in some cases seemingly to follow \\"fashion moves\\" by other countries. For instance, during the 1970s many countries issued Christmas stamps featuring children's drawings, with the young artist identified by name and age. The choice of secular or religious designs is frequently a bone of contention in some countries; church leaders often see secular designs as diluting the meaning of the holiday, while postal officials fear that overly religious designs could lead their secular or minority-religious customers to avoid the stamps, leaving millions unsold, and even expose the postal administration to charges that they are violating laws prohibiting the promotion of a particular religion. In the United States, annual discord over \\"secular\\" versus \\"religious\\" designs was eventually resolved by the Postal Service issuing some of each per year; typically a group of 4-6 related secular designs, plus a religious design (usually depicting the Madonna and Child). To avoid difficulties attendant upon contracting for original designs with a religious theme, the latter have typically been adapted from Old Master paintings hanging in U.S. galleries, thus qualifying as depictions of art. (In 2012, 2014, and 2016, however, religious-themed stamps were issued featuring original designs depicting the flight into Egypt, the journey of the Magi, and the Nativity of Jesus, respectively.) In the United Kingdom, the Royal Mail resolves the difficulty by issuing \\"religious\\" and \\"secular\\" themed designs in alternate years. Usage The usual usage of Christmas stamps is to quickly apply them to a stack of Christmas cards to go out. In the age of email, Christmas stamps may represent some individuals' largest remaining use of stamps in a year, and it is not unusual to see \\"leftovers\\" appear on regular mail during the first months of the new year. In Australia and the Netherlands, Christmas stamps are sold at a discount, but can be used after Christmas with additional stamps to make up the correct rate. Collecting Christmas is a popular theme for topical collecting. Because of the quantities printed, almost all Christmas stamps are easy to come by and of negligible cost. Collecting challenges would therefore be to get covers with apropos postal markings, such as a postmark on Christmas Day (not all post offices get the day off), or from a particular location (such as Christmas Island; Christmas, Florida; North Pole, Alaska; North Pole, New York; or Santa Claus, Indiana), or bearing a specific Christmas theme or slogan. The Christmas Philatelic Club was formed in 1969 by Christmas stamp collectors and issues a quarterly journal, the Yule Log. A number of collectors treat Christmas collecting as a subcategory of religion on stamps. Other holiday stamps The United States has occasionally issued stamps for other holidays, such as Thanksgiving and New Year's Day. During the 1990s, stamps for Kwanzaa, Hanukkah, Eid, and Chinese New Year have become a regular part of the holiday program, although the designs tend to be used for several years, distinguishable only by a different denomination or year date. In Japan, there is a longstanding tradition of a New Year's stamp. A number of Easter stamps have also been issued, but these are largely aimed at collectors. Valentine's Day stamps are a more recent tradition in some countries.

He is recognised as a progenitor of the Aribonid dynasty. In his day, the Pannonian march, also called marcha orientalis, corresponded to a front along the Danube river from the Bavarian Traungau up to Szombathely (Savaria) and the R√°ba river, including the Vienna Basin. Aribo was originally appointed by the East Frankish king Louis the German to succeed the Wilhelminer brothers William and Engelschalk I, after they died on campaign against the forces of the Great Moravian realm.For the Wilhelminer War, see MacLean pp 135-142 and Reuter 116. This has been used to support the hypothesis that he was a brother-in-law of the two margraves. Aribo maintained peace with Prince Svatopluk of Moravia and it paid off when, in 882, the sons of the late margraves Engelschalk I and William, led by Engelschalk II, rebelled against him, claiming their rights to the march. The Carolingian emperor Charles the Fat confirmed Aribo's position and Engelschalk II turned to Arnulf of Carinthia, Aribo's southern neighbour, for support. Svatopluk, however, entered the Wilhelminer War on the side of Aribo and the emperor. In 884, peace returned to the marcha. A sign of Aribo's strength after this was that he was unable to be unseated by Arnulf when the latter succeeded as King of East Francia in 887. In 893, Arnulf appointed Engelschalk II to a portion of the Pannonian march over Aribo's head.Reuter, 124. Aribo never reconciled with Arnulf after the Wilhelimner War and his contacts with the Moravians were kept secure. After his falling out, his son Isanrich got Moravian support against Arnulf. Around 905, Margrave Aribo issued a customs code concerning the trade along the Danube river at Raffelstetten. He survived the disastrous Battle of Pressburg, whereafter most of the margravial territory was lost. He last appeared in a 909 deed, when he and Archbishop Pilgrim of Salzburg were vested with Altm√ºnster Abbey by King Louis the Child. Aribo allegedly died hunting wisents. His descendants of the Aribonid family rose to the most powerful Bavarian dynasties. They held the Archbishopric of Salzburg and the office of a Bavarian count palatine in the 10th century, but eventually were pushed out of power in the Duchy of Bavaria by the Liutpoldings.Reuter, 125 and 196.

RV-4s have been flown around the world, notably by an Australian, Jon Johanson, who completed world-girdling RV-4 flights on two occasions. Many larger people find the RV-4 cockpit design physically constraining, and as a result VanGrunsven has designed an entire family of derivative designs. The RV-6 was designed to allow side-by-side seating, and the RV-8 was created as an enlarged aircraft that follows the RV-4's philosophy and offers tandem seating in a bigger aircraft. Unlike most later RV series designs, RV-4 kits are only available with conventional landing gear, although some may have been constructed in tricycle configuration by builders.

The Odes of Solomon is a collection of 42 odes attributed to Solomon. Various scholars have dated the composition of these religious poems to anywhere in the range of the first three centuries AD. The original language of the Odes is thought to have been either Greek or Syriac, and to be generally Christian in background. Manuscript history The earliest extant manuscripts of the Odes of Solomon date from around the end of the 3rd and the beginning of the 4th century: the Coptic Pistis Sophia, a Latin quote of a verse of Ode 19 by Lactantius, and the Greek text of Ode 11 in Papyrus Bodmer XI. Before the 18th century, the Odes were only known through Lactantius' quotation of one verse and their inclusion in two lists of religious literature. The British Museum purchased the Pistis Sophia (Codex Askewianus BM MS. add. 5114) in 1785. The Coptic manuscript, a codex of 174 leaves, was probably composed in the late 3rd century. The manuscript contains the complete text of two of the Odes, portions of two others, and what is believed to be Ode 1 (this ode is unattested in any other manuscript and may not be complete). Pistis Sophia is a Gnostic text composed in Egypt, perhaps a translation from Greek with Syrian provenance. After the discovery of portions of the Odes of Solomon in Pistis Sophia, scholars searched to find more complete copies of these intriguing texts. In 1909, James Rendel Harris discovered a pile of forgotten leaves from a Syriac manuscript lying on a shelf in his study. Unfortunately, all he could recall was that they came from the 'neighbourhood of the Tigris'. The manuscript (Cod. Syr. 9 in the John Rylands Library) is the most complete of the extant texts of the Odes. The manuscript begins with the second strophe of the first verse of Ode 3 (the first two odes have been lost). The manuscript gives the entire corpus of the Odes of Solomon through to the end of Ode 42. Then the Psalms of Solomon (earlier Jewish religious poetry that is often bound with the later Odes) follow, until the beginning of Psalm 17:38 and the end of the manuscript has been lost. However, the Harris manuscript is a late copy ‚Äî certainly no earlier than the 15th century. In 1912, F. C. Burkitt discovered an older manuscript of the Odes of Solomon in the British Museum (BM Add. 14538). The Codex Nitriensis came from the Monastery of the Syrian in Wadi El Natrun, sixty miles west of Cairo. It presents Ode 17:7b to the end of Ode 42, followed by the Psalms of Solomon in one continuous numbering. Nitriensis is written in far denser script than the Harris manuscript, which often makes it illegible. However, Nitriensis is earlier than Harris by about five centuries (although Mingana dated it to the 13th century). In 1955-6, Martin Bodmer acquired a number of manuscripts. Papyrus Bodmer XI appears to be a Greek scrap-book of Christian religious literature compiled in Egypt in the 3rd century. It includes the entirety of Ode 11 (headed Œ©ŒîŒó Œ£ŒüŒõŒüŒúŒ©ŒùŒ§Œüœπ), which includes a short section in the middle of the Ode that does not occur in the Harris version of it. Internal evidence suggests that this additional material is original to the Ode, and that the later Harris manuscript has omitted it. Authorship =Language and date= Although earlier scholars thought the Odes were originally written in GreekW. Frankenburg, ‚ÄúDas Verst√§ndnis der Oden Salomos ‚Äú(Beihefte zur Zeitschrift f√ºr die alttenstamentliche Wissenschaft 21; Giessen, 1911). or Hebrew,H. Grimme, Die Oden Salomos: Syrisch-Hebr√§isch-Deutsch (Heidelberg, 1911). there is now a consensus that Syriac/Aramaic was the original language.J. R. Harris, A. Mingana, A. V√∂√∂bus, J. A. Emerton, and James H. Charlesworth Their place of origin seems likely to have been the region of Syria. Estimates of the date of composition range from the 1stCharlesworth, James H (1977). The Odes of Solomon. Missoula, Montana: Scholars Press. . to the 3rdDrijvers, Han Jan Willem (1984). East of Antioch. Aldershot: Ashgate Variorum. . century, with many settling for on the 2nd century. Some have claimed that Ode 4 discusses the closing of the temple at Leontopolis in Egypt which would date this writing about 73 CE.Rutherford Hayes Platt \\"The lost books of the Bible and The forgotten books of Eden.\\" (Collins-World Publishers, 1926). One of the strong arguments for an early date is the discovery of references and perhaps even quotations from the Odes in the writings of St. Ignatius of Antioch,R.M. Grant: ‚ÄúThe Odes of Solomon and the Church of Antioch,‚Äù Journal of Biblical Literature 63 (1944) 363-97V. Corwin, ‚ÄúSt. Ignatius and Christianity in Antioch‚Äù (Yale Publications in Religion 1; New Haven, 1960), pp. 71-80 who was writing around 100 CE. =Liturgical use= The Odes of Solomon were, perhaps, composed for liturgical use. In the Syriac manuscripts, all of the Odes end with a hallelujah, and the Harris manuscript marks this word in the middle of an ode by the Syriac letter h√™ (). The use of plural imperative and jussive verb-forms suggest that on occasion a congregation is being addressed. Bernard,Bernard, JH (1912). \\"The Odes of Solomon\\" in Texts and Studies VIII. Aune, PiercePierce, Mark (1984). \\"Themes in the Odes of Solomon and other early Christian writings and their baptismal character\\" in Ephemerides Liturgicae XCVIII\\". and others who have commented on the Odes find in them clear early baptismal imagery ‚Äî water is an ever-present theme (floods, drinking the living waters, drowning and the well-spring) as is the language of conversion and initiation. Charlesworth has led the criticism of this view. Themes =Evangelism= The Odes reflect a surprising emphasis on spreading the knowledge of God, and conversion of others.Odes of Solomon 6; 10.3 Relation to the Psalms of Solomon Technically the Odes are anonymous, but in many ancient manuscripts, the Odes of Solomon are found together with the similar Psalms of Solomon, and Odes began to be ascribed to the same author. Unlike the Psalms of Solomon, however, Odes is much less clearly Jewish, and much more Christian in appearance. Odes explicitly refers not only to Jesus, but also to the ideas of virgin birth, harrowing of hell, and the Trinity. Adolf Harnack suggested the work of a Christian interpolator, adjusting an originally Jewish text. Relation to Catholic and canonical texts There are parallels in both style, and theology, between Odes and the writing of Ignatius of Antioch, as well as with the canonical Gospel of John. For example, both Odes and John use the concept of Jesus as Logos, and write in gentle metaphors. Harris lists the following similarities in theme between the Odes and the Johannine literature: * Christ is the Word * Christ existed before the foundation of the world (Odes 31, 33) (Others have questioned whether these texts speak of pre-existence) * Christ bestows living water abundantly * Christ is the door to everything * Christ stands to His people in the relation of Lover to Beloved * Believers love the Lord because He first loved them (Ode 3.3) * Believers' love to the Christ makes them His friends (Ode 8) It has been suggested that Ode 22.12 (\\"the foundation of everything is Your [God's] rock. And upon it You have built Your kingdom, and it became the dwelling-place of the holy ones.\\") may be an earlier version of the saying in Matthew 16.18 Relation to Gnosticism Many have doubted the orthodoxy of the Odes, suggesting that they perhaps originated from a heretical or gnostic group. This can be seen in the extensive use of the word 'knowledge' (Syr. ; Gk. Œ≥ŒΩœâœÉŒπœÇ gn≈çsis), the slight suggestion that the Saviour needed saving in Ode 8:21c ( ‚Äî 'and the saved (are) in him who was saved') and the image of the Father having breasts that are milked by the Holy Spirit to bring about the incarnation of Christ. In the case of 'knowledge', it is always a reference to God's gift of his self-revelation, and, as the Odes are replete with enjoyment in God's good creation, they seem at odds with the gnostic concept of knowledge providing the means of release from the imperfect world. The other images are sometimes considered marks of heresy in the odist, but do have some parallel in early patristic literature. Modern The Odes of Solomon have inspired modern musicians and their projects. In 2010, composer John Schreiner released a two-disc album called The Odes Project, which is an adaptation of the Odes of Solomon into modern music. cf. their new website The album Odes by Arthur Hatton, creator of LDS music website Linescratchers, was inspired by the Odes of Solomon and incorporated lines from the poems into its lyrics.

The table is made to look its prettiest, with cloth napkins and matching cups and plates. In addition to tea, larger parties may provide punch, or in cold weather, hot chocolate. The tea is accompanied by a variety of foods that are easy to manage while in a sitting room: thin sandwiches, such as cucumber or tomato, cake slices, buns or rolls, cookies, biscuits and scones are all common. History A Group of Artists, Paris c. 1929, by Jules-Alexandre Gr√ºn =Formal teas= Cake was a favorite food of Queen Victoria's and she reportedly ordered \\"16 chocolate sponges, 12 plain sponges, 16 fondant biscuits\\" along with other sweets for a tea party at Buckingham Palace. The afternoon tea party became a feature of great houses in the Victorian and Edwardian ages in the United Kingdom and the Gilded Age in the United States, as well as in all continental Europe (France, Germany, and above all in the Russian Empire). The formal tea party still survives as a special event, as in the debutante teas of some affluent American communities. In the older version, servants stayed outside the room until needed. Writing in 1922, Emily Post asserted that servants were never to enter the room unless rung for, to bring in fresh water and dishes or to remove used dishes. This was partly due to the rigidity of social convention at the time, but it also reflected the intimate nature of the afternoon tea. Proving the truth of 18th- century author Henry Fielding's quip that \\"love and scandal are the best sweeteners of tea\\", the custom of banning servants from the drawing room during tea shows the hostess's desire to encourage free conversation among her guests. Most of the formalities of that age have disappeared, particularly since World War II, when economic changes made household servants a rarity, but afternoon tea can still provide a good opportunity for intimate conversation and a refreshing light meal. Queen Elizabeth II's favorite tea cakes are honey and cream sponge and chocolate biscuit cake. Tea sandwiches might include smoked salmon, egg mayonnaise or ham and mustard among other offerings. Crustless triangle shaped tuna sandwiches are served on buttered loaves with thinly sliced cucumbers. =\\"Kettle drums\\"= tea table A less formal large afternoon party for tea was known during the 18th and 19th centuries as a \\"kettle drum\\". A widespread but possibly false folk etymology suggests that the name \\"kettle drum\\" may have originated in the informal tea gatherings hosted by British camp officers' wives during East India Company rule or the British occupation of India, during which kettle drums are claimed to have served as tea tables in the camps. Alternatively, \\"kettle drum\\" may have been an amalgam of \\"drum\\" ‚Äî 18th-century slang for a vivacious party ‚Äî and \\"kettle\\" for the tea served. At kettle drums, guests traditionally came for short periods and left at will, mingled and conversed with little formality, and partook of tea, chocolate, lemonade, cakes, and sandwiches.

Illustration from the late 19th century. A gas balloon is a balloon that rises and floats in the air because it is filled with a gas lighter than air (such as helium or hydrogen). When not in flight, it is tethered to prevent it from flying away and is sealed at the bottom to prevent the escape of gas. A gas balloon may also be called a Charli√®re for its inventor, the Frenchman Jacques Charles. Today, familiar gas balloons include large blimps and small latex party balloons. For nearly 200 years, well into the 20th century, manned balloon flight utilized gas balloons before hot-air balloons became dominant. Without power, heat or fuel, untethered flights of gas balloons depended on the skill of the pilot. Gas balloons have greater lift for a given volume, so they do not need to be so large, and they can stay up for much longer than hot air balloons. History 1900 Olympics ballooning event at Le Parc d'aerostation, Paris The first gas balloon made its flight in August 1783. Designed by professor Jacques Charles and Les Fr√®res Robert, it carried no passengers or cargo. On 1 December 1783, their second hydrogen-filled balloon made a manned flight piloted by Jacques Charles and Nicolas-Louis Robert. This occurred ten days after the first manned flight in a Montgolfier hot air balloon. The next project of Jacques Charles and the Robert brothers was La Caroline, an elongated steerable craft that followed Jean Baptiste Meusnier's proposals for a dirigible balloon, incorporating internal ballonnets (air cells), a rudder and a method of propulsion. On September 19, 1784 the brothers and M. Collin-Hullin flew for 6 hours 40 minutes, covering 186 km from Paris to Beuvry near B√©thune. This was the first flight over 100 km. Gas balloons remained popular throughout the age before powered flight. Filled with hydrogen or coal gas, they were able to fly higher, further and more economically than hot-air balloons. The altitude was controlled with ballast weights that were dropped if the balloon got too low; in order to land some lifting gas was vented through a valve. Tethered manned gas balloons were used for observation purposes in the Napoleonic Wars (to very limited extent), in the American Civil War (flown by Thaddeus Lowe) and in World War I by aviators wearing parachutes. Throughout the 19th century, they were popular as objects of public fascination among hobbyists and show performers, such as the Blanchards. Gas ballooning has been popular in Europe, most notably in Germany, using hydrogen as a lifting gas. Gas balloon clubs exist throughout the country. Rough estimates show 150 active gas pilots in Europe. In contrast, gas ballooning in the USA might have at most 30 active pilots who typically fly only once a year at the Albuquerque International Balloon Fiesta in October. Aerophile is the world's largest lighter-than-air carrier, flying 300,000 passengers every year through its eight tethered gas balloon operations in Walt Disney World, San Diego Zoo Safari Park, Smoky Mountains & Irvine in the US and Paris, Disneyland Paris and Parc du Petit Prince in France. Records On October 24, 2014, Alan Eustace, a former Google executive, made a jump from the stratosphere, breaking Felix Baumgartner's 2012 world record. The launch-point for his jump was from an abandoned runway in Roswell, New Mexico, where he began his balloon-powered ascent early that morning. He reached a reported maximum altitude of 135,908 feet (41.425 km; 25.7402 mi), but the final number submitted to the World Air Sports Federation was 135,889.108 feet (41.419000 km; 25.7365735 mi). Eustace in his pressure suit hung tethered under the balloon, without the kind of capsule used by Felix Baumgartner. Eustace started his fall by using an explosive device to separate from the helium balloon. The previous altitude record for a manned balloon flight was set at 39.045 kilometers on October 14, 2012 by Felix Baumgartner breaking a record of 34.7 kilometers on May 4, 1961 by Malcolm Ross and Victor Prather in a balloon launched from the deck of the in the Gulf of Mexico.Nicholas Piantanida, while attempting to set a new skydiving jump record, is claimed to have reached 123,800 feet (37.73 km) on February 2, 1966. Piantanida was unable to disconnect his breathing apparatus from the gondola, so the ground crew jettisoned the balloon at the flight ceiling. The flight did not set a flight record because he descended without the balloon. See excerpts from Craig Ryan's description of Piantanida's flight and harrowing descent: The altitude record for an unmanned balloon is 53.0 kilometers. It was reached by a balloon manufactured by Fujikura Parachute with a volume of 60 thousand cubic metres, launched in May 2002 from Sanriku, Iwate, Japan. This is the greatest height ever obtained by an atmospheric vehicle. Only rockets, rocket planes, and ballistic projectiles have flown higher. In 2015, pilots Leonid Tiukhtyaev and Troy Bradley arrived safely in Baja California, Mexico, after a journey of 10,711 km. The two men, originally from Russia and the United States of America respectively, started in Japan and flew with a helium balloon over the Pacific. In 160 hours and 34 minutes, the balloon, named \\"Two Eagles\\", arrived in Mexico, setting the longest distance and duration records for gas balloons.  On other planets The Soviet Union space probes Vega 1 and Vega 2 each dropped a helium balloon with scientific experiments into the atmosphere of Venus in 1985. The balloons first entered the atmosphere and descended to about 50 km, then inflated for level flight. Otherwise the flight was uncontrolled. Each balloon relayed wind and atmospheric conditions for 46 hours of a possible 60-hour electric battery power budget.

It was developed strictly for the US (and Canadian) markets, where larger pickups have a sizable market share. History 1993 Toyota T100 4X4 SR5 As Toyota firmly established itself in the North American compact pickup truck market in the 1980s through 1990s, it seemed only logical that Toyota needed to capture part of the lucrative full-size pickup truck market. Dealers had long been clamoring for a full-sized Toyota truck, especially in light of the high percentage of Toyota Pickup owners who moved on to domestic full- sized trucks. Rumored for many years before, the 1993 Toyota T100 boasted a full-size (8 ft) pickup bed but retained the engine and suspension setup of its smaller and older sibling, the compact Toyota Truck. Although the T100 was a bit larger than the competitive mid-size Dodge Dakota, it was still markedly smaller than full-size American pickup trucks of the time. This meant that the T100 occupied its own niche in the truck market. Though economical, reliable and practical, in the grand scheme of things the unsuccessful T100 had not captured as much of the market as Toyota had hoped. Many critics maintained the T100 was still too small for the full-size segment, while considerably larger than both the Toyota Truck and the Toyota Tacoma compact trucks. Wary of the political impact of competing directly with the Big Three, Toyota chose this somewhat smaller size (and limited lineup) so as not to risk blowback and import quotas. Although sales were slow at the start, the T100 sales did reach into the mid 40,000 vehicles sold range (1996) in the United States. Sales of the Chevrolet C/K were roughly 700,000 per year, while sales of the Ford F-Series surged from 550,000 to nearly 850,000 and Dodge went from 100,000 to 400,000 with the introduction of the new Dodge Ram in 1993. Sales of the T100 fell approximately 30 percent when the new Ram went on the market in October 1993, 11 months after the T100's launch in November 1992. Criticisms Upon introduction, the T100 was criticized for several things. The first was being too small to appeal to buyers of full-size work trucks, the second was the lack of an extended cab, and the third and perhaps most important criticism was the lack of a V8 engine, with the only available engine being a 3.0 liter V6, which was already found in Toyota's compact trucks and in the 4Runner.Sessions, p. 107 Although considered criticisms by many, Toyota stated these were all factors that were taken into consideration when designing and producing the T100. They claimed the smaller size was planned to offer a larger truck with a compact \\"feel\\", an Xtracab was on the horizon and the 3.0 liter V6 would provide far better fuel economy than the vehicles it aspired to rival. Both the V6 engine and the somewhat smaller dimensions were influenced by environmental concerns, issues that were irrelevant to American pickup buyers. Beyond the issues of size and horsepower the T100 did receive some praises from the media, acquiring J.D. Power and Associates Initial Quality Survey \\"Best Full-Size Pickup\\" award and the \\"Best of What's New\\" award by Popular Science magazine in its first year on the market. The T100 was the first vehicle ‚Äì car or truck ‚Äì ever to receive an \\"Initial Quality Survey Award\\" in its first year of production. For 1994 (the truck's second model year) and 1995 (the third), the T100 was again awarded \\"Best Full-Size Pickup in Initial Quality\\" by J.D. Power and Associates. In 1997 the T100 was awarded \\"Top Three Vehicles in Initial Quality ‚Äì Full-Size Segment\\" once again by J.D. Power and Associates. 1993 Toyota T100 4X4 rear view Design When it was introduced, the T100 had one cab configuration, a regular cab, and one available engine, a 3.0 L V6 with and of torque. In 1993, a 2.7 L inline-four engine with - same as for the 3.0 V6 - and of torque was added in the hopes new buyers would be drawn in with promises of greater fuel economy and a lower price (than previous models). The T100 was the first imported pickup truck that could carry a 4 by 8 feet plywood sheet between the wheelwells. The regular cab could seat three abreast in the front bench seat; this was split on the SR5 model. Automatics received a column shift while manuals were floor mounted, where the transfer case shifter was also located on 4WD models. Toyota ultimately realized there was no alternative but to add more power to the truck and for the 1995 model year Toyota added the and of torque 3.4 L V6. An Xtracab model came along several months into the 1995 model year as well, sitting on the same wheelbase with a bed. This provided a boost in sales of 150 percent for 1995. The T100 received only minor changes throughout its run, aside from the engine changes and the Xtracab addition. A driver-side airbag was installed for MY 1994 (a passenger-side airbag never became available), and larger 16-inch wheels became the norm for most of the 4X4 models starting in 1996. It was evident by late 1996/ early 1997 that Toyota was already investing in its next truck (what ultimately became the Toyota Tundra). At the time (late 1990s) some believed a revamped T100 with a V8 engine was on the way, and there were some reports that altered V8 powered T100s were used as test-mules, but ultimately it never came to pass, and the T100 was superseded by the Toyota Tundra. Toyota Racing Development (TRD) introduced a supercharger for the 3.4-liter engine in 1996 and it became available for the T100, the Tacoma and the 4Runner with the 3.4-liter V6 (and later the Tundra). Horsepower jumped to the range (depending of the generation of the supercharger) and to of torque. This power add on was available for 1997‚Äì1998 T100s only. Earlier 3.4 V6 powered T100s have different computer and electrical layouts which do not support the TRD device. The T100 was manufactured and partially engineered by Toyota-subsidiary Hino. Three trim lines were offered: the base model, the DX, and the top-of-the-line SR5. The maximum towing capacity was 5,200 lb (2,360 kg) and the truck had a payload limit of 2,450 pounds. Although most trucks fell within the 1/2 ton category, a 1-ton model was offered (in two-wheel drive form) for several of its earlier years until finally being dropped because of a lack of interest. All T100s were assembled in Tokyo, Japan and as a result were subject to a 25% import tariff on all imported light trucks. The T100 was the last Japanese-built Toyota pickup made for North America when production ceased in July 1998, sales being phased out in August and ending with the 1998 model year. The T100 was replaced by the larger V8-powered Tundra which debuted in 1999. Toyota had originally planned to continue the T100 naming system by calling the new truck the \\"Toyota T-150\\"; Ford made a successful claim that this was a copyright infringement of their F-150 and the name had to be changed. =Year-by-year changes= MY 1993 *Standard cab, long bed only *3.0 liter V6 engine only (150 horsepower ‚Äì of torque) MY 1994 *Driver's side airbag added *2.7 liter I4 engine added to lineup (150 horsepower ‚Äì of torque) MY 1995 *3.4 liter V6 engine added to lineup (190 horsepower ‚Äì of torque) *3.0 liter V6 discontinued *Xtracab model added to lineup *Last year for the regular cab 4X4 model MY 1996 *Color changes MY 1997 *Larger 16 inch wheel added to lineup *Color changes *TRD introduces 3.4 liter V6 supercharger (approx. 245 horsepower ‚Äì of torque) MY 1998 *Last year for the T100 *Color changes Gallery References Category:All-wheel-drive vehicles Category:Pickup trucks Category:Rear-wheel-drive vehicles T100 Category:Cars introduced in 1992 ","title":"Toyota T100"},{"id":"1244424","text":"Berber music refers to the musical traditions of the Berbers, an ethnic group native to the Maghreb, as well as parts of the Sahara, Nile Valley, West Africa. Berber music varies widely across North-West Africa and some of the best known varieties can be found in Moroccan music; Kabyle, Chawi and Gasba music from Algeria; and Tuareg from Burkina Faso, Niger and Mali. Ancient Berber music is stylistically diverse, with styles including pentatonic music, such instruments as the oboe and the bagpipes, and African rhythms along with singing. These ancient musical traditions have been kept alive by small bands of musicians traveling from village to village, entertaining at weddings and other social events with their songs, tales and poetry. Most Berber music is of the village- and urban-folk musical variety. Berber music and culture is influenced by the Berber people's long-standing struggle to achieve basic language rights and identity recognition in modern North African societies, aside from aesthetics and style. Musical/vocal styles Berber music is characterized by its use of folk oral traditions, as well as particular scales and rhythmic patterns, which include pentatonic music and African rhythms. All these elements are combined together to form one of the main sources of entertainment in Berber social ceremonies like marriages, as well as verses, tales and songs. Instrumentation The Berber people are spread out over a large part of Africa, but are mostly concentrated in the northwestern region of Africa. They use a vast array of both melodic and percussive instruments. The following instruments are part of their secular and religious dance and song: Taghanimt reed flute *Taghanimt, an end-blown reed flute. Used mostly to accompany songs rather than dance, the taghanimt has a rich, breathy texture. *Mizwid, a type of bagpipe; the term literally means \\"bag\\" or \\"food pouch\\". *Zukra (Tunisia) or ghaytah (Morocco). In both countries, these instruments are combined with several percussive instruments to create large ensembles which may perform at public festivals or similar occasions. *Nafir, a long natural horn, a type of valveless trumpet. This instrument is used mostly as a signaling instrument to send out messages to large groups, although it also has some performance value. *Ginbri (Morocco), a fretless plucked string instrument with a skin stretched over its body on the playing side: the skin has the same acoustic function as the membrane on a banjo. Most ensembles have at least one ginbri, although some have more than one. *Rebab, a long-necked bowed instrument with a large body. Like the ginbri, it is constructed with a skin on the string side. This instrument has only one string, usually of horse hair, and is commonly played alongside the ginbri. *Tabl (), a cylindrical double-sided drum. Although it has a similar usage and spelling to the tabla of India, no direct connection has been found between the two. The qas'ah is a large shallow kettledrum found mostly in Tunisia. Similar to the qas'ah is the Naqqarah, two ceramic kettledrums played simultaneously by both hands. *Bendir (Morocco), a snare frame-drum. A series of bendirs played simultaneously provide the main percussive rhythm for Berber music as the above-mentioned drums are more artistic than bendirs. *Qaraqib, a large metal castanet-like musical instrument.

Kabylia The music of the Kabyle Berbers has achieved some mainstream success outside of its Kabylia homeland, both in the rest of Algeria and abroad. Traditional Kabyle music consists of vocalists accompanied by a rhythm section, consisting of t'bel (tambourine) and bendir (frame drum), and a melody section, consisting of a ghaita (bagpipe) and ajouag (flute). =Development of Kabyle music= In the 1930s, Kabyles moved in large numbers to Paris, where they established cafes where musicians like added modern, Western instruments like the banjo, guitar and violin to Kabyle folk melodies. Slimane Azem was a Kabyle immigrant who was inspired by Nourredine and 19th century poet Si Mohand Ou Mohand to address homesickness, poverty and passion in his songs, and he soon (like many Kabyle musicians) became associated with the Algerian independence movement. By the 1950s, Arab classical music, especially Egyptian superstars like Umm Kulthum, had become popular and left a lasting influence on Kabyle music, specifically in lush orchestration. Cherif Kheddam soon arose with the advent of a Kabyle branch of Radio Algiers after independence in 1962, when France called a cease fire on 19 March and enacted the voting upon an agreement during a referendum in June. Included here were the Evian Accords which, for three years with all Algerians gave certain legal protections to colons equally. After the three years however, all Europeans would have to become Algerian citizens or risk being classified as aliens, which would then make them lose rights. Some of the rights discussed in the Accords were the right to participate in public affairs, the right to a full range of cultural and civic rights and the right to own property. Female singers also became popular during this period, especially Cherifa, Djamilla and Hanifa. Algerian independence did not lead to increased freedom for Kabyle musicians, and these Berbers soon included often covert lyrics criticizing the Ben Bella government, which had little repercussion due to the Evian Accords. Many of these musicians were inspired by other singer-songwriters, including Joan Baez and Bob Dylan, V√≠ctor Jara and Silvio Rodr√≠guez. With the song \\"A Vava Inouva\\" (1973), Idir brought international attention to Kabyle music and paved the way for the Algerian ra√Ø genre. Ferhat Mehenni, known for his politically uncompromising lyrics, Lounis Ait Menguellet, known for his poetic and inspired lyrics, also became popular during the 1970s and Amour Abdenour, who's ongoing career started in 1969 wrote and performed about kabyle society, nature and more importantly love relationships. By the time ra√Ø became popular in Europe in the 1980s, Kabyle artists were also moving towards sentimental, pop-ballads. Hassen Zermani's all-electric Takfarinas and Abdelli's work with Peter Gabriel's Real World helped bring Kabyle music to new audiences, while the murder of Matoub Lounes inspired many Kabyles to rally around their popular musicians. Modern singers include Djur Djura and many chawi singers and groups like Houria Aichi, Les Berberes, Amirouch, Massinissa, Amadiaz, Numidas, Mihoub, Massilia, Merkunda, Thiguyer, Salim Souhali (Thaziri), Dihya, and Messaoud Nedjahi. Morocco Traditional Moroccan Berber music can be categorised into collective and professional music. Dancers (back) and musicians (front) from Ouarzazate performing ahwash during the National Folklore Festival in Marrakesh (1970) In collective musical performances, men and women from entire families or villages participate in communal dances such as the ahwash and ahidus. A prayer is chanted at the beginning, followed by a response from a chorus of dancers. Accompanied by drums or ) and other percussion instruments, performers dance in two parallel rows or in a circle around the musicians. Led by an or poet, groups of usually four professional musicians () travel across the region to perform in various villages. The recites improvised poems about current national and world affairs. His fellow musicians accompany the poem with a drum, a single-string and a double clarinet. A Shluh Berber variant of professional music is performed by , led by a or . A or performance starts with the , an instrumental session on the rebab or wtar, followed by the tambourine and flute. The sets the basic notes of the melody. The middle section consists of sung poetry (), a choreographed overture (), a lively song (), and dance (). The marks the final part, in which the rhythm first accelerates and then ceases abruptly. Famous Moroccan Berber musicians include Ammouri Mbarek, a singer and songwriter active since the 1960s and considered the \\"John Lennon\\" of the Berber world, and Najat Aatabou, a singer whose debut cassette, \\"J'en ai Marre\\", sold an unprecedented half-million copies in Morocco. The Master Musicians of Jajouka tour internationally and have collaborated with Brian Jones of the Rolling Stones and William S. Burroughs. Many musicians have created fusion styles from Berber and European music, including Hindi Zahra, Hassan Hakmoun, Khalid Izri, Hassan Idbasaid, Thidrin, Med Ziani, Imtlaa and Houssaine Kili. Tuaregs The Berber music of the Tuareg region uses rhythms and vocal styles similar to the music of other Berber, Iberian, and Arab music, while West African call-and-response-style singing is also common. In contrast to many of the region's peoples, among the Tuareg music is mostly the domain of women, especially playing the imzhad, a string instrument like a violin. Tuareg weddings feature unique styles of music, such as women's vocal trilling and special dances (ilkan) of slaves marking the occasion.

It has a panoramic view of the windward (northeast) coast of Oahu. The Pali Highway (Hawaii State Highway 61) connecting Kailua/KƒÅneohe with downtown Honolulu runs through the Nuuanu Pali Tunnels bored into the cliffside. The area is also the location of the Nuuanu Freshwater Fish Refuge and the Nuuanu Reservoir in the jurisdiction of the Hawaii Department of Land and Natural Resources. The Nuuanu Pali State Wayside is a lookout above the tunnels where there is a panoramic view of the Oahu's windward side with views of KƒÅneohe, KƒÅneohe Bay, and Kailua. It is also well known for strong trade winds that blow through the pass (now bypassed by the Nuuanu Pali Tunnels). The Nu ªuanu Pali Tunnels were built in 1958. Before this road opened, people would use what is now known as the Old Pali Road, currently a popular hiking route. View of the windward coast of O ªahu from Nu'uanu Pali  History  KƒÅneohe town and KƒÅneohe Bay beyond. The Nuuanu Pali has been a vital pass from ancient times to the present because it is a low, traversable section of the Koolau mountain range that connects the leeward side of the mountains, Honolulu to the windward side, Kailua and KƒÅneohe. The route drew settlers who formed villages in the area and populated Nuuanu Valley for a thousand years. The Nuuanu Pali was the site of the Battle of Nuuanu, one of the bloodiest battles in Hawaiian history, in which Kamehameha I conquered the island of Oahu, bringing it under his rule. In 1795 Kamehameha I sailed from his home island of Hawaii with an army of 10,000 warriors, including a handful of non-Hawaiian foreigners. After conquering the islands of Maui and Molokai, he moved on to Oahu. The pivotal battle for the island occurred in Nuuanu Valley, where the defenders of Oahu, led by Kalanik≈´pule, were driven back up into the valley where they were trapped above the cliff. Kamehameha ªs warriors forced Maui Chief Kalanikupule's men to their deaths off of the cliff. Roughly 400 warriors died in this battle. After this battle, Kapanui recited a Hawaiian chant as a sign of respect to those who have died there. In 1845 the first road was built over the Nuuanu Pali, to connect Windward Oahu with Honolulu. In 1898, as this road was developed into a highway, workers found 800 human skulls‚Äîbelieved to be the remains of the warriors who fell to their deaths from the cliff above. This road was later replaced by the Pali Highway and the Nuuanu Pali Tunnels in 1959, which is the route used today. The now extinct bird, the Oahu nukupuu, was last collected in this valley. There is also a legend that takes place around the Nu ªuanu Pali. This is The Ghost Dog Legend. This legend states that when people came across this dog on the Pali, they had to turn back around or else they would not make it up the steep mountain. Because of these events, it is said that coming across this dog would lead to kaupe, meaning disaster.  Nuuanu Reservoir  The Nuuanu Reservoir is located up the Nuuanu Pali heading towards Kailua, in the valley jungle. This small body of water holds various species of catfish, and peacock bass. In efforts towards preserving the reservoir, appointments must be made half a year prior to the visiting date. This ensures a controlled number of residents that fish out of the waters, preventing overfishing. A fresh water game fishing license and an entry fishing card are required to fish there. There is a two fish per license limit, and any catfish that is 16 inches or larger must be kept. Nuuanu Trail The trail to Nuuanu began at Kalanikahua and led north of Kaumakapili Church to below the stream which flowed out of Kamanuwai pond. There the trail turned slightly to the right, went along the edge of the pond, and down into the water. Then, coming up on the bank onto Waiakemi, it led on to Waakekupua, along the bank of the taro patches, to the Pauoa stream, up to Pualoalo, and on to the gap at Nuuanu Pali. Superstition Decaying remains of the Old Pali Road. Two large stones near the back of Nuuanu Valley, Hapuu and Ka-lae-hau-ola, were said to represent a pair of goddesses who were guardians of the passage down the pali. Travellers would leave offerings of flowers or kapa (bark cloth) to ensure a safe trip, and parents buried the umbilical cords of newborns under the stones as a protection against evil. According to legend, the pass is inhabited by a moo wahine, a lizard who takes the form of a beautiful woman and leads male travelers to their deaths off the cliff, similar to a western poltergeist or mermaid. Hawaiian folklore holds that people should never carry pork over Nuuanu Pali, especially at night. Pele, the volcano goddess, was responsible for preventing passage due to her contest with Kamapua'a, a half human, half hog god, and would not allow him (in the form of pork) to trespass on her side of the island. Another story referenced by locals is the tale of the Nightmarchers. Nightmarchers are deceased Hawaiian warriors who passed away during the initial unification of the Hawaiian Islands under Kamehameha I. The warriors that passed away during the battle lay rest on the Old Pali Road, and near the Pali Lookout. Visitors should avoid the road on nights honoring certain gods and if they do encounter the marchers, they must look down and pay their respects. Cultural references \\"Pali Gap\\" (Nu'uanu Pali into English) is the title of a track from the posthumous 1971 album Rainbow Bridge by the guitarist Jimi Hendrix. 'The Pali', together with surrounding areas such as Tantalus Crater, is the main setting in the novel Micro by Michael Crichton and Richard Preston. The 2015 movie Pali Road is named for the old road over the Pali, although most of the action takes place elsewhere on Oahu.

Scaramanga is an assassin who kills with his signature weapon, a pistol made of solid gold. In the novel, the character is nicknamed \\"Pistols\\" Scaramanga and is also called \\"Paco\\" (a Spanish diminutive of Francisco). In the film, the character was played by Christopher Lee (the real-life step-cousin of James Bond creator Ian Fleming).  Novel biography  Francisco Scaramanga, of Spanish (Catalonia) origin, became a trick shot and performed in acts in a circus owned by his father Enrico while a youngster. He also cared for one of the circus elephants, which he stated was his only real friend. When the elephant went on a rampage during the circus visit to Trieste, Scaramanga witnessed a policeman kill him. The enraged boy, who was 16 at the time, retaliated by shooting the policeman through the heart. He then made his way to the United States from Naples, where he found employment as an enforcer for the Spangled Mob, an outfit that plays a role in two other Bond novels: Diamonds Are Forever (where they were the main foe of Agent 007) and Goldfinger as an accomplice to Auric Goldfinger's Operation Grandslam. He posed as a pitboy at the casino of Tiara Hotel in Las Vegas, Nevada, while in fact he was executioner of cheats and other transgressors within and outside the gang. In 1958 he was forced to emigrate from the U.S because of his gun duel with Ramon \\"The Rod\\" Rodriguez, his opposite from the Purple Gang of Detroit, also featured in the novel Goldfinger, in which he killed Ramon, earning $100,000 for it. He spent some time travelling the Caribbean as a representative of Las Vegas interests in real-estate and plantation dealing, later switching to Rafael Trujillo of the Dominican Republic and Fulgencio Batista of Cuba where he settled in 1959, in Havana. While remaining a Batista supporter, he started an undercover work for Fidel Castro's party, becoming an \\"enforcer\\" for DSS after the revolution. By the time Bond finally encounters him in The Man with the Golden Gun, Scaramanga works as a freelance assassin, often working for Castro's secret police, in addition to being engaged in other criminal enterprises such as drug-running into the United States in partnership with the KGB. MI6 has evaluated Scaramanga as one of the finest shots in the world, and M authorizes Bond to assassinate the gunman ‚Äî- if he can. Bond catches up with Scaramanga in Jamaica, where Bond pretends to be a freelance security officer named Mark Hazard, and Scaramanga hires him to guard an upcoming meeting of gangsters. During the meeting, a Dutch-born KGB officer named Hendricks blows Bond's cover, subsequently pitting Scaramanga and Bond in a shootout. Bond wounds Scaramanga, but before he can finish the gunman off, Scaramanga shoots Bond with a poisoned bullet from his backup weapon, a golden Derringer. Bond returns fire with his .32 Walther PPK pistol, killing Scaramanga instantly; soon thereafter, a policeman finds the nearly dead Bond in time to save him. In the novel, British intelligence also has an in-depth psychological profile of Scaramanga, which is printed in the book before the mission begins. He is 6 ft 3 inches (190 cm) tall, slim and fit. He is about 35, and has light brown eyes. His hair is reddish in a crew-cut with long sideburns. The profile (read by M) also delves into his background and psyche. Among other things, the profile claims that Scaramanga might be a latent homosexual, since he cannot whistle‚Äîbased on the popular (but unfounded) theory that a man who cannot whistle has homosexual tendencies. As with another of Bond's nemeses, Ernst Stavro Blofeld, the name is believed to have come from a schoolmate of Fleming's, George Ambrosios (Ambrose) Scaramanga.  Film biography  In the film The Man with the Golden Gun, Scaramanga is a high-priced assassin, supposedly the best in the world, charging one million dollars per kill. He is best known for being \\"the man with the golden gun\\", for using only bullets made of gold in a (fictional) 4.2 mm cartridge with a disassemblable golden handgun made of a gold cigarette case, gold cigarette lighter, gold fountain pen and gold cufflink as the gun's trigger. All of Scaramanga's assassination contracts are arranged through his henchman Nick Nack, which allows Scaramanga to be anonymous. His specialized ammunition is made by a custom gunsmith in Macau, who provides for its delivery to Scaramanga's lover, Andrea Anders, at a casino in Hong Kong. Francisco Scaramanga was a British national born in a travelling circus. His father was the ringmaster, a former Cuban national and his mother was the snake charmer. By age 10, he was part of the circus as a trick-shot pistol marksman. At age 15, he became an international assassin-for-hire. He was recruited some years later by the KGB while living in Ipanema, in Rio de Janeiro, Brazil, and trained in Eastern Europe where for many years he was basically just another \\"overworked and underpaid assassin\\" for the KGB. He quit the KGB in the late 1950s, becoming an independent hitman-for hire. No photographs of him exist, but he has an unusual anatomy: a third nipple. This information later comes in handy to Bond, who uses Scaramanga's anonymity and only known physical feature to get into contact with Scaramanga's current employer, the crime lord Hai-Fat‚Äîthough Scaramanga is already at Hai-Fat's estate, and Hai-Fat quickly guesses who Bond really is. Later in the film, Scaramanga reveals to Bond that as a boy living in the travelling circus, he shot and killed an abusive animal trainer for killing an elephant that he had befriended‚Äîand discovered that he \\"enjoyed killing people\\". Scaramanga also demonstrates his marksmanship to Bond by using a Colt Single Action Army to shoot the cork off a bottle of champagne from long range (Scaramanga's golden gun in the novel is a gold-plated Single Action Army), later dismissing it as a toy. Scaramanga lives very well, drawing from the exorbitant sums of money he charges to carry out his assassinations, and has built his home on his own personal island somewhere off the coast of south-eastern China‚Äîpaying for lease of the island and protection through assassinations ('favours') for the Chinese. Despite his assertion that \\"science was never [his] strong point,\\" the island utilizes many aspects of modern technology, including its own self- sufficient solar power plant. In addition to the power plant, Scaramanga's home also includes a section which is something between a labyrinthine maze and a funhouse, where Scaramanga and his foes duel to the death. Nick Nack hires assassins to kill Scaramanga as a challenge to keep him on his toes. Scaramanga is well aware of and approves of Nick Nack's efforts, and wishes him better luck next time when his hired guns fail. In addition, Scaramanga also has a private junk, which Bond later steals to get off the exploding island. Scaramanga also uses some of his wealth to finance research and development of technologies that rival those developed by MI6's Q Branch. Such technologies include a car that transforms into an aircraft and a solar- powered laser cannon. Scaramanga was hired by Hai-Fat to assassinate a British scientist named Gibson, thought to be in possession of solar energy information and technology crucial to solving the energy crisis. Gibson is assassinated and his invention, the solex agitator, is stolen from the crime scene by Nick Nack. The solex agitator is a critical component of Gibson's solar energy device. However, instead of turning the device over to Hai-Fat, Scaramanga instead kills Hai-Fat with his golden gun and takes the device for himself. With it in his possession, it allows for him to sell the device to the highest criminal bidder or use it to power his personal solar energy cannon. Scaramanga also desires to test his skills against Bond, whom he regards as his only worthy rival. Besides the profit and/or power the solex agitator can give him, Scaramanga's scheme in acquiring the device is also intended to lure Bond to Scaramanga's private island so that the two of them can engage in one final, decisive duel. Although Bond is using his six-bullet .380 Walther PPK pistol while Scaramanga uses the golden gun, Scaramanga states that \\"[He] only need[s] one\\"‚ÄîBond's superior number of bullets being offset by Scaramanga's advantages of fighting on his own ground. After taking Bond's fellow MI6 agent Mary Goodnight hostage, Scaramanga lures Bond to his private island, where he reveals his plan and challenges Bond to a duel in his funhouse. Once in the funhouse, Bond takes the place of a mannequin \\"James Bond\\" and tricks Scaramanga into coming out in the open to look for Bond with his pistol drawn. Bond then shoots Scaramanga in the heart, killing him, and sabotages the solar power plant in order to destroy the island. = Henchmen = * Nick Nack * Kra * Andrea Anders = Hit list = This is the death toll caused by Scaramanga in the film. * Rodney, arguably the same Slumber Inc. employee from Diamonds Are Forever. * Dan Gibson, inventor of the solex agitator * Hai-Fat * Andrea Anders In addition, Scaramanga is revealed to have been behind the murder of Bill Fairbanks, MI6 Agent 002, in 1969.  The Golden Gun  Scaramanga's Golden Gun In Ian Fleming's novel, the Golden Gun was a long-barrelled, gold-plated, single-action Colt Peacemaker .45 calibre revolver that fired silver-jacketed bullets with a solid gold core and a cross-cut tip for additional wounding due to the dum-dum effect. However, in the film, it was a single-shot weapon that fired a custom-made 4.2-millimetre dum-dum bullet made of 23-carat gold with traces of nickel, which Scaramanga carried on his belt buckle. The movie gun could be disassembled and its components disguised as a fountain pen (the barrel), a cigarette lighter (breech), cuff-link (trigger), and a cigarette case (the grip), all gold- plated. Scaramanga used the Golden Gun in numerous assassinations of officials, political enemies, gangsters, and a 00-agent, Bill Fairbanks (002). Scaramanga later used the Golden Gun to kill British scientist Gibson and Scaramanga's own employer, Hai-Fat. But, when Scaramanga was killed and his island destroyed, the Golden Gun was presumably also lost. The Golden Gun ranked sixth in a 2008 20th Century Fox poll of the most popular film weapons, which surveyed approximately two thousand film fans. In October 2008, the Golden Gun was stolen from the company Elstree Props which is based in Elstree Studios in Hertfordshire. At the time, the prop was estimated to be worth ¬£80,000.  Video games  Francisco Scaramanga is a playable character in the multiplayer portions of the 2003 game 007: Nightfire and the 2010 game GoldenEye 007. In the original GoldenEye game, Scaramanga's weapon, the golden gun, was initially added to the \\"Egyptian\\" level and multiplayer portion of the game. It is said in the briefing for the \\"Egyptian\\" mission that the Golden Gun was stolen from Scaramanga by Baron Samedi. Due to its popularity it was also added into subsequent James Bond games 007: The World is Not Enough, 007: Agent Under Fire, 007: Nightfire, 007: Everything or Nothing, GoldenEye: Rogue Agent, 007: From Russia With Love, 007: Quantum of Solace, GoldenEye 007 and 007 Legends. In The World is Not Enough for the Nintendo 64, the gun must be assembled from the pen, lighter, and case before it could be used. In each of the games (except Everything or Nothing), the golden gun would count for an instant kill, which reflected that Scaramanga never missed, although in the games the player can and because of this, the golden gun is not available in single player mode (except Everything or Nothing) but golden versions of the game's standard weapon(s) are usually available (such as a golden Walther PPK, P99, and a golden rocket launcher). In GoldenEye, the Golden Gun appears in a special mission. In the mission, the Golden Gun is stolen by Baron Samedi, and Bond needs to defeat Samedi and recover the Golden Gun. Although Samedi isn't killed, Bond escapes with the Golden Gun. Other variants of the Golden Gun also exist, such as the Golden PP7 and the Silver PP7. The Golden Gun also appears in the video game Quantum of Solace. In Quantum of Solace the Golden Gun appears to be based on the design on the gun from the novel (a gold-plated revolver), rather than the design used in the film. It is likely to be based on a Smith & Wesson Model 686 in the game. Perfect Dark, made by GoldenEye developer Rareware, also featured a Golden Gun which would count for an instant kill, this time a customized Colt Python revolver belonging to NSA boss Trent Easton. Francisco Scaramanga returned for the game GoldenEye: Rogue Agent voiced by Christopher Lee. In the game, he is an ally of Auric Goldfinger. He is the manufacturer of the synthetic eye given to the player (GoldenEye) and makes a virus used against Goldfinger's O.M.E.N. device. The game also features a Multiplayer \\"Funhouse\\" level, including the traps that caused Bond to lose most of his bullets such as Al Capone and Cowboy mannequins and an image of Scaramanga. In addition, the level includes a Bond mannequin, whose gun the player can take and use.  Reception  Francisco Scaramanga was listed at number five in UGO's list of the Top 11 Classy Assassins. Chris Nashawaty of Entertainment Weekly argues that Scaramanga is the best villain of the Roger Moore James Bond films.

Balkanabat is about 450 km west of Ashgabat and 160 km east of the port city of Turkmenbashi. The city has an airport with scheduled daily flights to Ashgabat. Name and history Monument in Balkanabat The town was founded in 1933 as \\"Neftedag\\", meaning \\"Oil Mountain\\" (from Russian neft, \\"oil\\", and Turkmen dag, \\"mountain\\"), as a settlement along one of the stations of Trans-Caspian Railway. In 1946, when it was transformed into a city, it was renamed \\"Nebit-Dag\\", also meaning \\"Oil Mountain\\" but this time using the Turkmen word nebit. There is a large monument on the far eastern side of the city called \\"Monument to the Desert Explorers\\" which depicts a camel and several men - Ivan Gubkin and peers - struggling to walk through the windy desert of Karakum while exploring petroleum. Nebit Dag was renamed to Balkanabat (Balkan from the name of the Balkan mountains, abat ‚Äì meaning ‚Äúpeaceful‚Äù in Turkmen and/or ‚Äúcity‚Äù in Persian) in 2001 by the decree of former President of Turkmenistan Saparmurat Niyazov.

It was opened in 2004 to model a similar concrete path outside of Ashgabat. The city has five bazaars (markets) G√∂k, Jennet, G√ºndogar, Bereket and bazaar on 5th microregion. There is hotel \\"Nebit√ßi\\", a theatre, museums, restaurants and parks in Balkanabat. The north side of town contains the large park \\"Saparmyrat T√ºrkmenba≈üy Se√Ωilg√§hi\\" which contains tennis courts, a life-size chess board and plenty of benches. The Yomud tribe was historic to the Balkan region and the Yomud carpet g√∂l (pattern) is one of the five patterns represented on the Turkmen flag. In the 2000s, the city is undergoing improvement of the city's streets, construction of large housing facilities, apartments with improved planning is underway. Thanks to the wise and far-sighted policy of the respectable President of Turkmenistan, massive housing construction continues. The buildings of the State Drama Theater, the Museum of History and Local Lore, a diagnostic center, a wedding palace, a Balkanabat Railway Station building, a Balkan Regional Library, a stadium for 10,000 seats, a multi-profile market and other social and cultural facilities were built in the city.–ë–∞–ª–∫–∞–Ω–∞–±–∞—Ç —Ä–∞—Å—à–∏—Ä—è–µ—Ç –≥—Ä–∞–Ω–∏—Ü—ã Demographics Most of the residents are Turkmens; other ethnicities include Russians, Kazakhs, Lezgins, Azeris, Armenians, Uzbeks, Tatars and Karakalpaks.

Animal breeding and wheat and cotton cultivation are another areas of economy in Balkanabat. There are range of national banks, Turkmenpostal services in the centre by Magtymguly Shayoly, near 197 kvartal.  Transport  The city is connected to Turkmenistan cities by Turkmenistan Airlines, as by air, train and bus. Buses route is from east to the west of Magtymguly shayoly (highway) and makes stops at bus station. While there is no official cab company, private citizens operate shared cabs. Almost any vehicle will pick up passengers. If the driver has already passengers in the car, then he will agree to take you if headed in the similar direction of their other available passengers. The city layout is a grid of apartment blocks called kvartal (quarters). There are main streets called Magtymguly, Pervomayskiy and Gurbansoltan eje shayoly. = Air = The Balkanabat Airport is well served with connections only to domestic destinations (Ashgabat, Mary, Dashoguz and Turkmenabat).

(Italian.) on the one side and the Ottoman Navy, under Mezzo Morto H√ºseyin Pasha, and allied Barbary forces on the other. The encounter was indecisive, and no vessels were lost on either side. Background Contarini, with 22 sailing ships, left Porto Poro on 28 July and arrived at Port Gavrion, on the west coast of Andros, on 3 August, while a galley force, under , went to Kekhrios, on mainland Greece, ready for an attack on Thebes. On 6 August the Muslim fleet of 20 Ottoman and 15 African ships was sighted north of Andros. It sailed around to Gavrion and tried to tempt Contarini out, but the wind was from the north (possibly this should be south), and Contarini had orders not to engage unless he had the weather gauge, and even after the Ottomans sent galliots in and landed troops all he did was send a small craft to drive them off. The Ottomans left and anchored to the west. For ten days nothing happened, except for a French merchantman entering the harbor being fired on by the Venetians, who mistook it for a fireship.  The battle  On 20 August the north wind dropped and at 5:00 pm the Ottoman fleet appeared again off the town and opened fire, with little result, before becoming becalmed to the south during the night. On 21 August the wind was from the north again and Contarini, seeing his chance, sailed, but the wind dropped at about 12:00 pm and he made for the southeast end of Andros with what wind there was, being joined there by the galley force that had just arrived from the west, early on 22 August. A slight easterly wind gave Contarini another chance and he sailed west, the galleys towing the sailing ships, toward the south end of the Ottomans, who were arranged vaguely in an easterly Ottoman line and a westerly African line but mainly in a group formation, and turned north, coming alongside them with his first seven ships (Tigre, Rosa, San Andrea, San Lorenzo Giustinian (flag), San Domenico, Fede Guerriera and San Sebastiano) and attacking at about 12:00 am. At about 2:00 pm the rowing vessels detached and formed a line abreast to the south of the Ottomans. Both sides' sailing ships formed themselves more or less into lines, and the Ottoman fleet gradually bore away. At 4:00 pm the wind dropped and the Venetian galleys, which had cut back through the line, then re-emerged and attacked the Ottomans in a line abreast. The Turks withdrew after about two hours, eventually making their way south to near the island of Syros, while the Venetians eventually sailed back to Port Gavrion. Until 1 December the Venetians sailed around looking for the Ottoman fleet, when they heard that it had sailed back into the Dardanelles almost a month earlier. Christian casualties were 56 killed and 125 wounded in the sailing ships and about 19 casualties in the rowing vessels.

Newton's method uses curvature information (i.e. the second derivative) to take a more direct route. In calculus, Newton's method is an iterative method for finding the roots of a differentiable function , which are solutions to the equation . In optimization, Newton's method is applied to the derivative of a twice- differentiable function to find the roots of the derivative (solutions to ), also known as the stationary points of . These solutions may be minima, maxima, or saddle points. Newton's Method The central problem of optimization is minimization of functions. Let us first consider the case of univariate functions, i.e., functions of a single real variable. We will later consider the more general and more practically useful multivariate case. Given a twice differentiable function f:\\\\mathbb{R}\\\\to \\\\mathbb{R}, we seek to solve the optimization problem : \\\\min_{x\\\\in \\\\mathbb{R}} f(x) . Newton's method attempts to solve this problem by constructing a sequence \\\\\\\\{x_k\\\\\\\\} from an initial guess (starting point) x_0\\\\in \\\\mathbb{R} that converges towards a minimizer x_* of f by using a sequence of second-order Taylor approximations of f around the iterates. The second-order Taylor expansion of around x_k is :f(x_k + t) \\\\approx f(x_k) + f'(x_k) t + \\\\frac{1}{2} f(x_k) t^2. The next iterate x_{k+1} is defined so as to minimize this quadratic approximation in t, and setting x_{k+1}=x_k + t. If the second derivative is positive, the quadratic approximation is a convex function of t, and its minimum can be found by setting the derivative to zero. Since :\\\\displaystyle 0 = \\\\frac{\\\\rm d}{{\\\\rm d} t} \\\\left(f(x_k) + f'(x_k)t + \\\\frac 1 2 f(x_k) t^2\\\\right) = f'(x_k) + f (x_k) t, the minimum is achieved for : t = -\\\\frac{f'(x_k)}{f(x_k)} . Putting everything together, Newton's method performs the iteration : x_{k+1} = x_k + t = x_k - \\\\frac{f'(x_k)}{f(x_k)}. Geometric interpretation The geometric interpretation of Newton's method is that at each iteration, it amounts to the fitting of a paraboloid to the surface of f(x) at the trial value x_k, having the same slopes and curvature as the surface at that point, and then proceeding to the maximum or minimum of that paraboloid (in higher dimensions, this may also be a saddle point). Note that if f happens to a quadratic function, then the exact extremum is found in one step. Higher dimensions The above iterative scheme can be generalized to d dimensions by replacing the derivative with the gradient (different authors use different notation for the gradient, including f'(x) = abla f(x) = g_f(x)\\\\in \\\\mathbb{R}^d), and the reciprocal of the second derivative with the inverse of the Hessian matrix (different authors use different notation for the Hessian, including f(x) = abla^2 f(x) = H_f(x)\\\\in \\\\mathbb{R}^{d\\\\times d}). One thus obtains the iterative scheme :x_{k+1} = x_k - [f(x_k)]^{-1} f'(x_k), \\\\qquad k \\\\ge 0. Often Newton's method is modified to include a small step size 0 < \\\\gamma \\\\le 1 instead of \\\\gamma=1: :x_{k+1} = x_k - \\\\gamma [f(x_k)]^{-1} f' (x_k). This is often done to ensure that the Wolfe conditions are satisfied at each step of the method. For step sizes other than 1, the method is often referred to as the relaxed or damped Newton's method. Convergence If is a strongly convex function with Lipschitz Hessian, then provided that x_0 is close enough to x_*=\\\\arg \\\\min f(x) , the sequence x_0, x_1, x_2, \\\\dots generated by Newton's method will converge to the (necessarily unique) minimizer x_* of f quadratically fast. That is, : \\\\x_{k+1}-x_*\\\\ \\\\leq \\\\frac{1}{2} \\\\x_{k}-x_*\\\\^2, \\\\qquad \\\\forall k\\\\geq 0. Computing the Newton direction Finding the inverse of the Hessian in high dimensions to compute the Newton direction h = - (f(x_k))^{-1} f'(x_k) can be an expensive operation. In such cases, instead of directly inverting the Hessian, it's better to calculate the vector h as the solution to the system of linear equations :[f(x_k)] h = - f'(x_k) which may be solved by various factorizations or approximately (but to great accuracy) using iterative methods. Many of these methods are only applicable to certain types of equations, for example the Cholesky factorization and conjugate gradient will only work if f(x_k) is a positive definite matrix. While this may seem like a limitation, it's often a useful indicator of something gone wrong; for example if a minimization problem is being approached and f(x_k) is not positive definite, then the iterations are converging to a saddle point and not a minimum. On the other hand, if a constrained optimization is done (for example, with Lagrange multipliers), the problem may become one of saddle point finding, in which case the Hessian will be symmetric indefinite and the solution of x_{k+1} will need to be done with a method that will work for such, such as the LDL^\\\\top variant of Cholesky factorization or the conjugate residual method. There also exist various quasi-Newton methods, where an approximation for the Hessian (or its inverse directly) is built up from changes in the gradient. If the Hessian is close to a non-invertible matrix, the inverted Hessian can be numerically unstable and the solution may diverge. In this case, certain workarounds have been tried in the past, which have varied success with certain problems. One can, for example, modify the Hessian by adding a correction matrix B_k so as to make f(x_k) + B_k positive definite. One approach is to diagonalize the Hessian and choose B_k so that f(x_k) + B_k has the same eigenvectors as the Hessian, but with each negative eigenvalue replaced by \\\\epsilon>0. An approach exploited in the Levenberg‚ÄìMarquardt algorithm (which uses an approximate Hessian) is to add a scaled identity matrix to the Hessian, \\\\mu I, with the scale adjusted at every iteration as needed. For large \\\\mu and small Hessian, the iterations will behave like gradient descent with step size 1/\\\\mu. This results in slower but more reliable convergence where the Hessian doesn't provide useful information. Stochastic Newton's Method Many practical optimization problems, and especially those arising in data science and machine learning, involve a function f:\\\\mathbb{R}^d\\\\to \\\\mathbb{R} which arises as an average of a very large number of simpler functions f_i: : f(x) = \\\\frac{1}{n}\\\\sum_{i=1}^n f_i(x) . In supervised machine learning, f_i(x) represents the loss of model parameterized by vector x \\\\in \\\\mathbb{R}^d on data training point i , and f(x) thus reflects the average loss of the model on the training data set. Problems of this type include linear least squares, logistic regression and deep neural network training. In this situation, Newton's method for minimizing f takes the form : x_{k+1} = x_k - \\\\left(\\\\frac{1}{n} \\\\sum_{i=1}^n f_i(x_k)\\\\right)^{-1}\\\\left( \\\\frac{1}{n}\\\\sum_{i=1}^n f_i'(x_k) \\\\right). Recall that the key difficulty of standard Newton's method is the computation of Newton's step which is typically much more computationally demanding than the computation of the Hessian f(x_k) and the gradient f'(x_k). However, in the setting considered here with f being the sum of a very large number of functions, the situation reverses and the computation of f(x_k) and f'(x_k) by averaging the Hessians and gradients of the individual functions f_i becomes the bottleneck. In this big n regime, the above issue can be resolved by considering the stochastic Newton (SN) method developed and analyzed by Kovalev, Mishchenko and Richt√°rik. SN is a generalization of Newton's method which allows for a flexible choice of the set S_k of functions for which the computation of the Hessian and gradient is necessary. This set can be chosen to be S_k = \\\\\\\\{1,2,\\\\dots,n\\\\\\\\}, in which case SN reduces to Newton's method. However, one can also choose S_k = \\\\\\\\{i\\\\\\\\} , where i is a random element of \\\\\\\\{1,2,\\\\dots,n\\\\\\\\}. The Method. In general, SN is a parametric family of methods with parameter \\\\tau \\\\in \\\\\\\\{1,2,\\\\dots,n\\\\\\\\} controlling the batch size. Given \\\\tau, in iteration k we let S_k be a random subset of \\\\\\\\{1,2,\\\\dots,n\\\\\\\\} chosen uniformly from all subsets of cardinality \\\\tau. That is, all subsets of cardinality \\\\tau are chosen with probability 1 / {d \\\\choose \\\\tau} . The two cases described above are special cases of this for \\\\tau=n and \\\\tau =1, respectively. The Stochastic Newton method maintains a sequence of vectors x_k^1, x_k^2, \\\\cdots, x_k^n\\\\in \\\\mathbb{R}^d for k\\\\geq 0. At the beginning, i.e., for k=0, these vectors are initialized arbitrarily. A sensible choice is to set them to be equal. The method then performs the following steps: :Step \\\\;1: \\\\quad x_{k+1} = \\\\left(\\\\frac{1}{n} \\\\sum_{i=1}^n f_i(x^i_k)\\\\right)^{-1} \\\\left( \\\\frac{1}{n} \\\\sum_{i=1}^n f_i(x^i_k) x^i_k - f_i'(x^i_k) \\\\right) :Step \\\\;2: \\\\quad \\\\text{Sample } S_k\\\\subseteq \\\\\\\\{1,2,\\\\dots,n\\\\\\\\} :Step \\\\;3: \\\\quad x^i_{k+1} = \\\\begin{cases}x_{k+1} & i\\\\in S_k \\\\\\\\\\\\ x^i_k & i otin S_k\\\\end{cases}. Note that if x_0^1 = x_0^2 =\\\\cdots = x_0^n and \\\\tau=n, SN reduces to Newton's method described above. However, in contrast with Newton's method, in iteration k, SN needs to compute the gradients and Hessians of functions f_i for i\\\\in S_k only. In particular, the batch size \\\\tau can be chosen to be a constant, in which case the cost of each iteration of SN is independent of n. Convergence. For \\\\tau= n, SN has local quadratic convergence rate identical to Newton's method. For \\\\tau, SN has a local linear convergence rate independent of the condition number. In particular, it was shown by Kovalev, Mishchenko and Richt√°rik that if f is strongly convex and has Lipschitz Hessian, then as long as the initial iterates x_0^1, x_0^2, \\\\cdots, x_0^n are sufficiently close to the (necessarily) unique minimizer x_* of f, then : {\\\\rm E} \\\\left[\\\\frac{1}{n}\\\\sum_{i=1}^n \\\\x_k^i - x_*\\\\^2\\\\right] \\\\leq \\\\left(1 - \\\\frac{3 \\\\tau}{4 n} \\\\right)^k \\\\left[\\\\frac{1}{n}\\\\sum_{i=1}^n \\\\x_0^i - x_*\\\\^2\\\\right], where {\\\\rm E}[\\\\cdot] refers to mathematical expectation with respect to the randomness inherent in the algorithm. This is a much better rate than what is obtainable by any stochastic first order method, such as stochastic gradient descent. Indeed, the convergence rate of all first order method depends on the condition number of f, which is typically defined as \\\\kappa = L/\\\\mu, where 0<\\\\mu\\\\leq L are constants such that : \\\\mu I \\\\preceq f(x) \\\\preceq L I, \\\\qquad \\\\forall x\\\\in \\\\R^d. There are various techniques which can to some extent reduce but which can't completely eliminate the effect of the conditioning \\\\kappa on the convergence rate of first order methods. These techniques include adaptive stepsizes, minibatching, importance sampling, Polyak momentum, Nesterov's momentum and variance reduction. In contrast to all of these techniques, SN completely removes the effect of conditioning. However, as Newton's method, SN suffers from reliance on local convergence guarantees only.

He was with the University of Oregon's football program for over 20 years serving as offensive coordinator for six years, head coach for 14 years, and athletic director for one year. Bellotti is the winningest coach in Oregon football history and is credited with building the program into a major football power. He was elected to the College Football Hall of Fame in 2014. Early life Bellotti attended Ygnacio Valley High School in Concord, California, where he played football, basketball and baseball and graduated in 1969. After high school, he went to the University of California, Davis and played football at the positions of tight end and wide receiver. He started at tight end as a sophomore and junior, then earned second-team all-Far Western Conference honors at wide receiver as senior. Bellotti graduated from UC Davis with a B.A. in Physical Education in 1973. He completed the teaching credential program at UC Davis in 1974. In 1982, Bellotti earned his Master of Science degree in Physical Education at California State University, East Bay (then known as Cal State- Hayward). He is an alumnus of the Delta Sigma Phi fraternity. Coaching career =UC Davis= In 1973, Bellotti started his career in football coaching at his alma mater as an assistant coach under College Football Hall of Fame coach Jim Sochor. The next season, he worked as the JV team's offensive coordinator, and during the 1975 and 1976 seasons he was the JV team's head coach. Also at that time, he served as the receivers coach for the varsity team and as a coach for UC Davis' JV baseball team. =Cal State Hayward= Bellotti was hired at California State University, Hayward (Cal State Hayward or CSU-Hayward; now California State University, East Bay) in 1977 and worked as the offensive coordinator for two seasons. He returned to the school as offensive coordinator in 1980, and remained until 1983. In 1982, he earned a master's degree from the school in physical education. =Weber State= In 1979, Bellotti served as offensive coordinator at Weber State University, returning to CSU-Hayward after just one season. =Chico State= California State University, Chico (Chico State) hired Bellotti to serve as their head football coach in 1984. He remained head coach until 1988 and compiled a record of 21‚Äì25‚Äì2. His record in the Northern California Athletic Conference was 15‚Äì9‚Äì2. =Oregon= University of Oregon head coach Rich Brooks hired Bellotti as offensive coordinator in 1989. Bellotti remained in that position through the 1994 season, when Brooks left to coach in the National Football League, and Bellotti was promoted to head coach starting with the 1995 season. Bellotti's record at Oregon stands at 116‚Äì55. In 2006, he passed his former boss, Rich Brooks, as the winningest football coach in Oregon's history. He led the Ducks to their first four ten-win seasons in school history (2000, 2001, 2005, 2008); they had only won nine games on three occasions in the 100 years before Bellotti took over. He led the Ducks to 12 bowl games, three more than they had attended in their entire history before his arrival. His best season was 2001, when he led the Ducks to an 11‚Äì1 record and a victory in the Fiesta Bowl. They finished second in both major polls, the highest final ranking in school history. The 11 wins would remain a school record until the 2010 team's 12-win season. Bellotti also led Oregon to a regular season #2 ranking in the 2007 season, albeit very briefly. After achieving that ranking, the Ducks lost Heisman Trophy candidate quarterback Dennis Dixon to a season-ending knee injury, and Oregon proceeded to lose three straight games to Arizona, UCLA, and arch-rival Oregon State to close out the regular season. Earlier that season, Bellotti had led Oregon to a resounding 39‚Äì7 victory over Michigan at \\"The Big House\\", earning the Ducks and Dixon much national attention. Oregon also defeated #9 USC and #6 Arizona State in back-to-back games at Autzen Stadium earlier that season. Oregon recovered from their three-game losing streak following the Dixon injury by defeating South Florida in the Sun Bowl in dominating fashion (56‚Äì21), thus ending a streak of four straight bowl losses for the Ducks. In 2008, the Ducks recovered strongly from a mid-season lull to win their last four games against solid competition, including a Holiday Bowl win over 13th-ranked Oklahoma State. Although he only won two Pac-10 titles due to the latter half of his tenure being occupied by USC's dominance of the conference, Bellotti is still credited with building Oregon into a major football power nonetheless. Oregon athletic director On December 2, 2008, shortly after defeating the Oregon State Beavers in the Civil War to prevent them from clinching a Rose Bowl berth, the university announced that Bellotti would pass the head coaching position on to Offensive Coordinator Chip Kelly at some undetermined point in the future and take over as the university's athletic director at that time. During his tenure as athletic director, Bellotti dealt with a number of disciplinary issues involving members of the football program, including LeGarrette Blount, LaMichael James, and Jeremiah Masoli, and fired long-time basketball coach Ernie Kent, whose teams had performed poorly in recent seasons. After just nine months on the job, Bellotti announced his resignation March 19, 2010 to join ESPN as a college football analyst. Bellotti had agreed to terms with UO officials, but there was no written contract. The resignation agreement, including the payout terms, was placed on paper and signed by Bellotti on March 16, with university president Richard Lariviere signing it on March 19. Because of the lack of an initial written contract, the Oregon Justice Department reviewed the $2.3 million severance payment from the University of Oregon to the former athletic director. In addition to the buyout Bellotti draws a $559,000 yearly pension from the Oregon Public Employees Retirement System. In 2009, Bellotti was named third vice president of the American Football Coaches Association. According to AFCA tradition, he would move up to second vice president in 2010, first vice president in 2011 and president in 2012.SJSU's Tomey is named president of American Football Coaches Association - Associated Press - January 13, 2009 ESPN analyst In March 2010, Bellotti announced that he was resigning as athletic director to become a college football television analyst on ESPN, with his first appearance on ESPN to occur in April.

United States. Runkle was also an Episcopal rector and twice served as trustee of Miami University. Early life Runkle was born in West Liberty, Ohio to Ralph Edwin Runkle and Hannah Isabella Piatt. He attended Geneva College and, later, Miami University, from which he graduated in July 1857. It was while attending Miami University that Runkle became one of the founders of the Sigma Chi fraternity. In Sigma Chi he is remembered most for his pugnaciousness; he threw his Delta Kappa Epsilon (DKE) badge on the table in disgust in the pivotal meeting between the founders of Sigma Chi and Whitelaw Reid. He stood up to Reid and said, \\"I didn't join this fraternity to be any one's tool. And that, sir, is my answer!\\" (Years after this heated meeting with Reid, Runkle said that had the situation been explained to him further and had Reid approached the situation in a more respectful way, there probably would have been a more reasonable resolution and, in effect, no Sigma Chi fraternity.) It is also said that he once was temporarily suspended from school for fighting in chapel with a Beta Theta Pi brother who publicly sneered at his badge. Runkle married Venitia Reynolds on June 4, 1857 and their daughter, Maud Elizabeth Runkle, was born January 15, 1859 in Findlay, Ohio. After college, he studied law under General Samson Mason in Springfield and was admitted to the bar in July, 1859. He was the 1860 Democratic candidate for the Ohio State Senate. Runkle volunteered for an Ohio militia company and, when the Civil War began, it became a part of the 13th Ohio Infantry. Daguerreotype image of Benjamin Piatt Runkle circa 1857, then an undergraduate student at Miami University in Oxford, Ohio, U.S.A. around the time of the founding of the then-called \\"Sigma Chi Society.\\" Civil War =13th Ohio Infantry= Runkle was commissioned as a captain in the 13th Ohio Infantry on April 22, 1861, and served as such until November 8, 1861, when he was promoted to the rank of major after the Battle of Carnifex Ferry. In April 1862 the 13th Ohio, then in Virginia, made a forced march to join General Don Carlos Buell's forces in Kentucky, then continued on with Buell's forces to the Battle of Shiloh. Upon arrival, the regiment led an attack that captured the Washington Artillery Battery of New Orleans. He was shot through the feet during a Confederate counter-attack, but continued until wounded again with a shot through the right jaw. He was thought to be mortally wounded, and Whitelaw Reid, then a correspondent for the Cincinnati Gazette, had seen Runkle's wounds and filed a glowing obituary saying in part \\"He died a hero. Green grow the grass above his grave.\\" Runkle not only survived but outlived Reid, and in turn praised him in an obituary. He was promoted to lieutenant colonel in May 1862. =45th Ohio Infantry= After recovering from his wounds, on August 19, 1862 he was commissioned Colonel of the 45th Ohio Infantry. The regiment was ordered to Cynthiana, Kentucky where it remained until General Kirby Smith's advance following the Confederate victory at the Battle of Richmond, Kentucky on August 30, 1862, forced the 45th Ohio, along with the 99th Ohio Infantry, to pull back to the Ohio River at Covington, Kentucky where they participated in the Defense of Cincinnati. In mid-February the regiment was mounted at Danville, Kentucky and Colonel Runkle commanded the brigade formed by the mounted 45th Ohio along with the 7th Ohio Cavalry and 10th Kentucky Cavalry regiments. Runkle's men broke the enemy line at the Battle of Dutton's Hill in Somerset, Kentucky on March 30, 1863 and he was thanked for his gallantry on the field by Quincy Gillmore, the commanding general, who gave Colonel Runkle's command entire credit for the victory. Fought in the Battle at Monticello, Kentucky on May 1, 1863 where Confederate forces under General Pegram were driven from the field. =Other commands= From July 1863 to January 1864, while recovering from wounds, he served on the staff of Ohio governor David Tod and led Ohio Militia units in response to Morgan's Raid. He later commanded the 3rd Brigade of the 4th Division of the XXIII Corps in Kentucky and Tennessee and participated in Sherman's Atlanta Campaign at the battles of Rocky Face Ridge and Resaca. Runkle was honorably mustered out July 21, 1864 and on August 29, 1864, he was appointed lieutenant colonel in the Veteran Reserve Corps where he commanded the 21st Regiment until the war ended. Freedmen's Bureau While in the Veteran Reserve Corps, Runkle was assigned to work at the Bureau of Refugees, Freedmen, and Abandoned Lands (Freedmen's Bureau) where he served as Chief Superintendent of the Freedmen's Bureau for Memphis, Tennessee. On January 13, 1866, President Andrew Johnson nominated Runkle for appointment to the grade of brevet brigadier general of volunteers, to rank from November 9, 1865, and the United States Senate confirmed the appointment on March 12, 1866.Eicher, John H., and David J. Eicher, Civil War High Commands. Stanford: Stanford University Press, 2001. . p. 756. He served as the Chief Superintendent of the Freedmen's Bureau for Memphis, Tennessee during the violent Memphis Riots of 1866 on May 1, 1866, where, since he had few troops available, he was powerless to protect the black Union veterans who had been mustered out of the army the previous day. On January 7, 1869, Runkle became the head Superintendent of Freedmen's Affairs, State of Kentucky. Since the government had announced plans to terminate Freedmen's bureau operations in Kentucky, Runkle and his caretaker staff presided over bureau school closings and the dispersal of the remaining funds, which were completed in the summer of 1870, although the veterans' claim offices remained open through June 1872. While serving as both an active duty army major and as a disbursing officer of the Freedmen's Bureau for the State of Kentucky in 1870, he was placed on the retired list as major, but continued as a disbursing officer until he was arrested and tried before a court-martial for financial irregularities on the part of his sub-agents for \\"alleged failures to pay, or to pay in full\\". Court-martial The court-martial found Runkle guilty of conduct unbecoming an officer and gentleman and of violating the March 2, 1863, c. 67, ¬ß 1, Act of Congress. His sentence was imprisonment, payment of a fine, and dismissal from the army, where he had been serving on the retired list and drawing retired pay. The Secretary of War, William W. Belknap, reviewed the proceedings and in 1873 issued an order approving Runkle's conviction, but in consideration of his war service and wounds, granted Runkle executive clemency in the name of the President and eliminated the fine and prison sentence. However, his dismissal from the army remained in effect. Under the law at that time, any court martial sentence involving an officer's dismissal in peacetime needed to be confirmed by the President and there was no indication in this order that the conviction was confirmed by President Ulysses S. Grant himself. On the same day that he was cashiered, Runkle petitioned President Grant, complaining that his sentence had not been confirmed by the President. This petition was referred by Grant to the Judge Advocate General for review. It remained open when President Rutherford B. Hayes came into office, as President Grant had done nothing further in the matter. Hayes then picked it up as unfinished business and registered an order of disapproval, revoking the 1873 order dismissing Runkle. Supreme Court Case ‚Äì Runkle v. United States On the authority of the executive order, Runkle was given retirement pay ‚Äì both from the date of the Hayes order going forward and back pay to the date he was dismissed. In 1882, he made a claim for additional longevity pay, which was referred to the Court of Claims. In the Court of Claims, however, the government challenged his right to any pay at all, asserting that Hayes did not have the right to revoke the 1873 order confirming Runkle's dismissal, and demanded Runkle reimburse the government for the pay he had received following Hayes' disapproval of the court-martial decision. Runkle appealed to the Supreme Court, which found in his favor, ruling that Runkle was never legally dismissed from the army, and was entitled to longevity pay, as well as the regular pay he already received, both before and after Secretary Belknap's order was revoked. Later life Benjamin Piatt Runkle memorial When he retired from military service in 1870, Runkle was a major and brevetted colonel in the Regular Army. From 1879-1880 he studied at the Protestant Episcopal Theological Seminary in Gambier, Ohio and from 1880-1885 served as rector of parishes at Galena, Ohio, Midland, Michigan, Minneapolis, Minnesota and Greencastle, Indiana. Runkle married his second wife, Lalla McMicken, February 10, 1894 in Los Angeles, California. Runkle was the only founder of Sigma Chi to become Grand Consul, serving as the seventh national president from 1895-1897. Runkle held commands at the Peekskill Military Academy, the Military School in Freehold, New Jersey, and at the Miami Military Institute in Germantown, Ohio from 1902 to 1909. He served as trustee of Miami University from 1863-1872 and from 1912 until his death. Runkle died at his home in Hillsboro, Ohio on June 28, 1916, the fraternity's sixty-first birthday. He is buried in Arlington National Cemetery, Section 1, Grave 240, in Virginia.

Conjugal means there is a marriage relationship. The family relationship is principally focused inward and ties to extended kin are voluntary and based on emotional bonds, rather than strict duties and obligations. The spouses and their children are considered to be of prime importance, and other more distant relatives less important. The marriage bond is important and stressed. Since the notion of \\"family\\" has changed over time (for example, increasing acceptance of same-sex parenting, stepfamily, and adoption), the meaning of the term \\"nuclear family\\" became muddled (some use it to refer exclusively to opposite-sex parents, while others do not). To combat the ambiguity, the term \\"conjugal family\\" was created.  In Western societies  There are basic characteristics to a conjugal family. In most western societies, people are free to choose their spouse themselves, rather than their spouse being selected for them by arranged marriage. In western societies, the majority- but not all- pairings are opposite-sex. Western societies often treat marriage as a legally-binding relationship, rather than an informal agreement. In these societies, both partners usually share control of their children's upbringing. They both have roles as a parent to protect their children, oversee the development of their children in society, and see to the survival of their children. In some cases, both partners have separate lines of income to support the family; in others, only one receives substantial income (colloquially called the \\"breadwinner\\") while the other spends more time caring for the family directly (looking after the children, taking care of the home, etc.).  Throughout the years  Conjugal family roles have changed over the years. Historically, marriages were exclusively opposite-sex and it was assumed that the male would be the head of the household and provide for the family while the woman would stay in the home and care for the children. However, conjugal roles have evolved over the years; in modern times, same-sex couples are more accepted and in opposite-sex couples, the husband and wife are treated equally.

The unit was largely composed of volunteers from the Kingdom of Slavonia and Slavonian Military Frontier, and named after security guards otherwise employed to maintain public order. The Pandurs were presented to the empress in May 1741--with the unit's military band--earning them a claim of pioneering martial music in Europe. The Pandurs did not use uniforms and had an overall oriental/Ottoman appearance. The original organization of the unit was retained until 1745, when it transformed into a regiment. Trenck was relieved of command in 1746 and imprisoned in Spielberg Castle, where he died in 1749. The unit ultimately transformed into the 53rd Infantry Regiment, headquartered in Zagreb, until it was disbanded in 1919. The regiment's commemorative medals bear Trenck's image wearing Pandur attire. The Pandurs took part in the War of the Austrian Succession, including the First and Second Silesian War. They contributed to the capture or destruction of Zobten am Berge, Strehlen, Klaus Castle, Linz, Deggendorf, Diessenstein Castle, Cham, Cosel fortress and Munich. During the Battle of Soor, the unit looted a Prussian war chest and the belongings of Frederick the Great. They also took part in the Battle of Waterloo. In the Wellington museum in Waterloo, Belgium, their motto Vivat Pandur can be read, on a sword found on the battlefield. The Pandurs earned a reputation as brave, audacious, feared and ruthless soldiers, known for looting and pillaging. They were prone to disobedience, breaches of military discipline and stubbornness. The city of Waldm√ºnchen, located near Cham, celebrates the Pandurs and Trenck as the city's saviors for sparing the city from destruction in 1742. The Pandurs' and Trenck's heritage is also preserved in the city of Po≈æega, Croatia, where an eponymous living history troop and city music band exist. Etymology The term pandur made its way into military use via the Hungarian language‚Äîbeing used in Hungarian as a loanword, in turn originating from the Croatian term pudar, though the nasal in place of the \\"u\\" suggests a borrowing before Croatian innovated its own reflex for Proto-Slavic /…îÃÉ/. \\"Pudar\\" is still applied to security guards protecting crops in vineyards and fields, and it was coined from the verb puditi (also spelled pudati) meaning to chase or scare away. The meaning of the Hungarian loanword was expanded to guards in general, including law enforcement officers. The word was likely ultimately derived from medieval Latin banderius or bannerius, meaning either a guardian of fields or summoner, or follower of a banner. Trenck's Pandurs living history troop from Po≈æega, Croatia By the middle of the 18th century, law enforcement in the counties of Croatia included county pandurs or hussars who patrolled roads and pursued criminals. In 1740, the term was applied to frontier guard duty infantry deployed in the Croatian Military Frontier (Banal Frontier), specifically its Karlovac and Vara≈ædin Generalcies. The role of the pandurs as security guards was extended to Dalmatia after the establishment of Austrian rule there in the early 19th century. The term has dropped from official use for law enforcement officials, but it is still used colloquially in Croatia and the Western Balkans in a manner akin to the English word cop. The unit raised and led by Trenck is also referred to more specifically as Trenck's Pandurs, and less frequently in Croatia than elsewhere, as Croatian Pandurs. History The Pandurs were a skirmisher unit of the Habsburg Monarchy, raised by Baron Franz von der Trenck following a charter () issued by Maria Theresa of Austria on 27 February 1741, permitting Trenck to raise a 1,000-strong troop. The unit was largely composed of men enlisted as volunteers from areas of the Kingdom of Slavonia and Slavonian Military Frontier, consisting of ethnic Croats and Serbs. The Pandurs saw military action in Silesia, Bohemia, Bavaria and France. The Pandurs arrived in Vienna for a military parade for the empress on 27 May 1741. The unit was headed by Trenck and included two captains, a senior lieutenant, five lieutenants, a quartermaster, an adjutant, two chaplains (a Catholic and an Orthodox Christian), two medics, 40 sergeants, five scribes, 80 corporals and twelve musicians equipped with flutes, a drum and cymbals. The musicians were called the Turkish band, after Ottoman military bands, and are considered pioneers of martial music in Europe according to Jurica Miletiƒá. The Pandurs did not have specific uniforms‚Äîtheir clothes varied but were of Turkish style. Their oriental appearance was compounded by mandatory head shaving, leaving a rattail, as well as by the use of a horse tail bunchuk instead of a unit banner. Each Pandur carried four single-shot pistols, a fighting knife and a small knife. Baron Franz von der Trenck The Pandurs took part in War of the Austrian Succession, including the First Silesian War. They took part in capturing Zobten am Berge and Strehlen in Lower Silesia from the Prussians, and defending a bridgehead near Vienna after the Battle of Mollwitz. In 1742, the Pandurs took part in capture of Klaus Castle in Styria as well as Linz and Deggendorf, where they defeated French troops before taking part in Austrian recapture of Munich. By the end of that year, the Pandurs had captured Diessenstein Castle and Cham from Bavarian defenders, completely destroying Cham to secure access for Habsburg troops led by Ludwig Andreas von Khevenh√ºller to Bohemia. In 1743, the Pandurs led by Trenck captured Cosel fortress. In 1745, during the Second Silesian War, the Pandurs took part in the Battle of Soor, where they looted a Prussian war chest containing 80,000 ducats, as well as weapons, horses and a tent belonging to Frederick the Great. The Pandurs earned a reputation for being brave and audacious, as well as feared and ruthless soldiers, looting and pillaging, but also characterized by disobedience, breaches of military discipline and stubbornness. On the other hand, the City of Waldm√ºnchen, located near Cham, celebrates the Pandurs and Trenck as their savior for sparing the city from destruction in 1742. Since 1950, the city organizes a historical reenactment of the event involving about 300 actors. The original organization of the unit was retained until 1745, when it was transformed into a Pandur regiment following Trenck's petition to the empress. Trenck was relieved of command in 1746 and tried for unspecified \\"acts of violence\\". He was imprisoned in Spielberg Castle, where he died in 1749. After the Peace of Aachen, the regiment was transformed into a Slavonian battalion on 22 December 1748. In 1756, as the Seven Years' War started, the battalion was reformed into the 53rd Infantry Regiment and its headquarters moved to Zagreb ending history of the Pandurs. Still, the regiment kept its Pandur lineage alive through its commemorative medals bearing Trenck's image wearing Pandur attire. The regiment was disbanded in January 1919. Legacy Pandur II infantry fighting vehicle The achievements of the Pandurs led by Trenck left a lasting mark on the culture and heritage of Croatia as well as Bavaria. An example of the unit's legacy is found in the village of Trenkovo--named after the commander of the Pandurs in 1912. The village is located in area of Trenck's former Velika estate, near Po≈æega, Croatia, where the baron lived. It was the location of a baroque manor once owned by Trenck, which was replaced by another structure in the late 18th or early 19th centuries. Pandur heritage is preserved by the Trenck's Pandurs () military band‚Äîthe official music band of the city of Po≈æega‚Äîestablished on 28 January 1881. In 1997, an eponymous living history troop was established out of members of the band. Also, a Trenck festival is held annually in Waldm√ºnchen, commemorating the events of 1742, when the city was spared by Trenck from destruction. The military unit and its leader also give their names to a modern armed force unit and modern military equipment. Special police platoon Trenk, formed in Po≈æega on 8 March 1991, took part in the Croatian War of Independence. Steyr-Daimler-Puch produces the Pandur armoured fighting vehicle.

Prior to being elected in his own right to full gubernatorial terms in 1859 and 1861, he served as acting governor from January 5 to 10, 1854, following the resignation of Henry S. Foote. A member of the Democratic Party, Pettus had previously been a Mississippi state representative, a member and president of the Mississippi Senate. He strongly supported Mississippi's secession from the Union in 1861 and sought cooperation with the Confederate States Government. Early life John Jones Pettus was born on October 9, 1813 in Wilson County, Tennessee, to John Jones, a farmer, and his wife Alice Taylor (n√©e Winston) Pettus. He was the brother of Edmund Pettus. He was raised in Limestone County, Alabama, after his father moved the family to Tennessee. Only nine when his father died, Pettus helped out with chores and was educated at home by his mother. Pettus settled in Mississippi in 1835. After a brief stay in Sumter County, Alabama, where he studied law, he opened a law practice in Scooba, Mississippi, where in the 1840s he married a cousin, Permelia Winston. He became a successful farmer and by 1850 owned and enslaved twenty-four human beings. Political career In 1844, Pettus represented Kemper County in the Mississippi House of Representatives. In 1848, he was elected to the Mississippi Senate. In 1853, while Governor Henry S. Foote was waiting for the January 11 inauguration of John J. McRae, Foote grew bitter and angry, addressing the legislative session by announcing that he had considered resigning in protest once the election results came in. At noon at January 5, 1854, Foote's resignation was received by the state senate. The Mississippi Constitution of 1832 had abolished the office of lieutenant governor. Pettus, as President of the Mississippi Senate, was next in seniority and sworn at noon on January 7, 1854. He held the governorship until McRae was sworn in on January 10, 1854.John J. Pettus at the National Governors Association His only recorded act during these 120 hours was to order a special session in Noxubee County to fill the office of a deceased state representative, Francis Irby. On January 11, McRae was inaugurated as Governor and Pettus returned as senate president. During the 1850s, he became identified as \\"the Mississippi Fire-eater,\\" a term referring to Southerners supporting secession. In 1859, he was elected Governor. In his inaugural address, he said that the south's only way to maintain slavery was secession and called for the establishment of a southern confederacy. Following President Abraham Lincoln's election, on November 26, 1860, Pettus called for a Special Session of the Legislature and urged the Legislature to call for a convention to withdraw Mississippi from the Union. The Legislature called for a Secession Convention which convened in Jackson on January 7, 1861. Two days later, Mississippi officially seceded from the Union. On February 4, 1861, along with five other slave states, the Confederate States of America was established at Montgomery, Alabama. Pettus was re-elected in the fall of 1861. Pettus was succeeded by Charles Clark. Later life Ineligible under the Mississippi Constitution to run for a third term, Pettus was commissioned a colonel in the state militia. In September 1865 he took the oath of allegiance to the United States government, but failed on three separate occasions to receive a presidential pardon. After the war, he relocated to Pulaski County (present-day Lonoke County), Arkansas. Pettus died on January 25, 1867, of pneumonia and is buried in the Flat Bayou Cemetery, Jefferson County, Arkansas.

DeMille, his second picture to be filmed in color. It is based on a serialized story written by Thelma Strabel in 1940 for The Saturday Evening Post. The movie, released shortly after the United States' entry into World War II, was a swashbuckling adventure set in the 1840s along the Florida coast, and was wildly successful. While he based his film on Strabel's story, DeMille took liberties with details such as sibling relationships and subplots, while staying true to the spirit of the story, which centers on a headstrong, independent woman portrayed by Paulette Goddard. Plot In 1840, Loxi Claiborne (Goddard) is running a marine salvage business started by her deceased father. A hurricane is passing through the Key West area, leaving behind at least one wreck on the nearby shoals. The Jubilee founders, and Loxi and other salvagers race to claim the cargo. Not arriving first, Loxi and her crew rescue the captain, Jack Stuart (Wayne), but do not share in the salvage rights. Apparently, the first salvager on the scene, King Cutler (Raymond Massey), may have actually planned the wreck. Ray Milland and Paulette Goddard Nursing Jack back to health, Loxi falls in love with him. When she visits Charleston with her cousin Drusilla (Hayward), Loxi schemes to win a plum captain's position for Jack by seducing Steve Tolliver (Milland), who is running the sailing ship line for which Jack works. Steve falls for Loxi and returns with her to Key West to investigate the truth about Jack's shipwreck. Drusilla goes home to Havana when Loxi and Steve return to Key West. Steve has come to rid the Keys of pirates like Cutler (and to be near Loxi). Cutler, in turn, arranges to have Steve shanghaied by the crew of a whaler. Loxi hears of the plot and gets Jack to help her save Steve. Later, they discover that Steve has concealed Jack's appointment to the steamship Southern Cross on orders from his superior. Angry over a seemingly underhanded act, Jack meets with Cutler. He learns that Steve's boss has just died and that Steve will be taking over the shipping line. Jack realizes that he is unlikely to keep his command with Steve in charge and agrees to work with Cutler to sabotage his new ship; he sails to Havana to take command. John Wayne as Jack Stuart in Reap the Wild Wind (1942) Rumors circulate and prices of the cargo of the Southern Cross fluctuate wildly, leaving Steve to suspect a wreck is planned. He commandeers the Claiborne with Loxi on board and heads to Havana to stop Jack. Loxi, believing Jack is innocent, disables her ship, and they sit becalmed in a fog bank as the Southern Cross piles into a reef and sinks. Unknown to Jack, Drusilla had stowed away to be with her lover, King Cutler's brother Dan (Preston), and she drowned. Jack is put on trial for wrecking his ship. The testimony reveals a woman may have been on board, though none was rescued. To determine if a woman is in the wreck, Steve agrees to dive to the wreck with Jack. While down in the wreck, Jack and Steve discover proof that Drusilla was on board and has been drowned. They are attacked by a giant squid. Jack saves Steve's life, but is lost when the Southern Cross slips off the continental shelf into deep water. Dan Cutler accuses his brother of murder and is shot dead by him, whereupon, Steve shoots King Cutler, killing him. Loxi and Steve return to Charleston together.

Wayne subsequently starred in a 1948 seafaring adventure titled Wake of the Red Witch which had numerous similarities to Reap the Wild Wind, including Wayne's portrayal of an even darker character. This film also marks the final appearance by Hedda Hopper as an actress in a significant role. The gossip columnist would, however, make cameo appearances in subsequent films.

He served time in prison in 2005 after pleading guilty to conspiracy to distribute steroids and money laundering. He currently operates Scientific Nutrition for Advanced Conditioning (SNAC Nutrition).  Early life and music  Victor Conte Jr. was born in 1950 in Fresno, California to Shirley and Victor Conte Sr. He was the oldest of three children in a working-class Italian family. After graduating from McLane High School he attended Fresno City College but dropped out of college in 1969 after being convinced by his cousin, musician Bruce Conte, to join the band Common Ground as bass player. In 1970 he quit playing in Common Ground and joined the band Pure Food and Drug Act. At the time Conte's nickname was \\"Walking Fish\\", due to his unusual way of moving across the stage when he was performing. He left Pure Food and Drug Act some time prior to 1977. Victor Conte was a member of Tower of Power from 1977 until 1979 playing bass guitar. He also collaborated during that period with pianist Herbie Hancock and violinist Sugarcane Harris.  Bay Area Laboratory Co-operative  He founded in 1984 the Bay Area Laboratory Co-operative (BALCO), a sports nutrition center first located in Millbrae, California and later relocated to Burlingame, California. The United States Anti-Doping Agency (USADA) says he developed the banned steroid tetrahydrogestrinone (THG) with the help of bodybuilding chemist Patrick Arnold. Pursuant to a plea bargain struck with prosecutors, he entered guilty pleas in July 2005 to one count of conspiracy to distribute steroids and a second count of laundering a portion of a check. He was sentenced in October to spend four months in the federal Taft Correctional Institution in Taft, California, and another four on house arrest. In December 2004, he participated in an interview with Martin Bashir on ABC's 20/20 program, where he admitted to running doping programs, which have broken Olympic records, as well as revealing that: \\"The whole history of the games is just full of corruption, cover-up, performance-enhancing drug use.\\" In the interview he implicated, among others, five-time Olympic gold medalist Marion Jones and her partner Tim Montgomery, Kelli White (who later admitted using performance-enhancing drugs), British athlete Dwain Chambers, and NFL player Bill Romanowski. On December 21, 2006, Yahoo Sports reported that one of Conte's initial defense lawyers, Troy Ellerman, had been targeted by the FBI as a possible source of leaks to the media during the Barry Bonds probe. On February 14, 2007, Ellerman pleaded guilty to leaking grand jury testimony. It was also reported that FBI agents were an additional source of leaks. In May 2007, Conte claimed to again be providing supplements for Dwayne Chambers, who left athletics to play in the NFL Europa league for the Hamburg Sea Devils before returning to athletics in 2008. According to Conte, these nutritional supplements, provided via his company Scientific Nutrition for Advanced Conditioning, are perfectly legal. On December 13, 2007 Conte appeared on CNN before the Mitchell report was officially released.  Books  Game of Shadows: Barry Bonds, BALCO, and the Steroids Scandal that Rocked Professional Sports was published in 2006 by two San Francisco Chronicle investigative reporters, relating to the case. There were controversies about the informant and/or source of the information for these books and related court cases. In 2008, in the aftermath of the investigation, Conte produced a book BALCO: The Straight Dope on Barry Bonds, Marion and What We Can Do to Save Sports which was co-written with author Nathan Jendrick. There had been a legal battle of defamation litigation regarding the book's publication by boxer Shane Mosley and it delayed the publication date. Mosley dropped the lawsuit, but not before Skyhorse publishing had been scared away from publishing. The book is officially unpublished as of 2017, but the unpublished manuscript has been made available.  Scientific Nutrition for Advanced Conditioning  In 2011, Conte started a new company, Scientific Nutrition for Advanced Conditioning (SNAC Nutrition) based in San Carlos, California, which in addition to nutritional supplements also offers boxing and sports training. SNAC Nutrition is working with boxer Zab Judah, and Conte has previously worked with Andre Berto, Nonito Donaire, and Andre Ward.

The allegation is thus that the candidate is being ‚Äúparachuted in‚Äù for the job by a desperate political party that has no reliable talent indigenous to the district or state or that the party (or the candidate himself/herself) wishes to give a candidate an easier election than would happen in one's own home area. Canada *Chrystia Freeland faced allegations of being parachuted in by the Liberal Party to contest a 2013 by-election in safe seat Toronto Centre, given she was living in New York City at the time. She ultimately won the seat. *In 2008, the New Democratic Party nominated Phyllis Artiss of St. John's for the riding of Labrador. Artiss was nominated in the absence of any local candidate, and admitted that her candidacy was not ideal: \\"It would be much better to have someone from Labrador who has lived there all their lives or much of their lives and worked there, and I haven't done that.\\" *Kellie Leitch was accused of being a parachute candidate when she sought the Conservative nomination in the riding of Simcoe-Grey in Ontario. Leitch was born in Winnipeg, Manitoba and worked in Toronto at the time of her nomination. *Patrick Brown, previously been MP for Barrie and MPP for Simcoe North, was criticized as a parachute candidate when he announced his campaign for Mayor of Brampton in 2018. Brown ultimately was successful in his mayoral bid.  New Zealand  * In 2017 Deborah Russell won selection for the safe Labour seat of New Lynn, in south-east Auckland despite being from Whangam≈çmona, a small town in the Manawat≈´-Whanganui region. She beat out Greg Presland a New Lynn resident for 30 years who had the backing of the local members but lost to Russell who was backed by Labour's Council because of her finance expertise and a pledge to have more women in electorates. Upon winning selection Russell moved to the electorate. United Kingdom Parachute candidates are common in the Parliament of the United Kingdom. The Westminster system historically emphasizes party discipline over responsiveness to constituencies. Margaret Thatcher represented Finchley despite living in Chelsea, London. A 2013 YouGov survey found that support for a hypothetical candidate rose by 12 points after voters learned that his opponent had moved to the area two years earlier, and by 30 points if the opponent lived 120 miles away. The percentage of local MPs rose, according to Michael Rush of the University of Exeter, from 25% in 1979 to 45% in 1997; Ralph Scott of Demos calculates that 63% are local. According to surveys public trust in all MPs has decreased but trust in the local MP has increased, making pre-existing connections to seats more important. Election advertisements mention the candidate's party or party leader less often, and emphasize local connections. Such a change produces MPs that are more attentive to local issues, but may be detrimental to Britain's first-past-the- post system designed to create broad parties that party whips stabilize. *Roy Jenkins was so unfamiliar with Glasgow, he later wrote, that on arrival to campaign for the 1982 Glasgow Hillhead by-election its skyline was \\"as mysterious to me as the minarets of Constantinople\\" to Russian troops during the Russo-Turkish War. Jenkins won the election, taking the seat from the Scottish Conservatives. *Shaun Woodward defected from the Conservative Party to the Labour Party in 1999. He faced much criticism from former Conservative colleagues, particularly when he refused to resign and fight a by-election. Woodward did not run for re-election in his safe Conservative seat of Witney in Oxfordshire, instead being selected for the ultra-safe Labour seat of St Helens South in Merseyside. Labour Minister Chris Mullin wrote later in his diaries that \\"the New Labour elite parachuting [Woodward] into a safe seat ... [was] one of New Labour's vilest stitch-ups ... [it] made my flesh creep.\\" *Luciana Berger was an example of Labour parachuting a middle-class southerner into one of its traditional heartland seats, in her case the northern working- class safe seat of Liverpool Wavertree. She was heavily criticised for having no connection to the Wavertree constituency or Liverpool when she first ran in 2010. When asked by a local radio station to answer basic questions about Liverpool she was unable to, and during the candidate selection process stayed at local MP Jane Kennedy's house rather than make any permanent home in the area. The media raised suggestions that she was only selected for the seat because of her close connections to the Blair family. She went on to win the seat in 2010 and retain it in 2015 and 2017. After joining the Liberal Democrats in 2019, she unsuccessfully contested the Greater London seat of Finchley and Golders Green in the 2019 general election. She made the decision to stand there because of the seat's high Jewish population and Remain vote, as well as her affinity towards living in London and choice to raise her children there, rather than in Liverpool. *David and Ed Miliband were selected to fight safe Labour seats in northern England, South Shields and Doncaster North respectively, despite being Oxford graduates who were born, raised, and living in London whilst working as political advisers. Both would later serve as cabinet ministers and fight against each other in the 2010 party leadership election. *Douglas Carswell defected from the Conservatives to the UK Independence Party in 2014, in turn displacing the existing UKIP candidate in his constituency of Clacton. Given Carswell was living in London at the time, he was accused carpetbagging by the former UKIP candidate. *George Galloway was expelled from Labour in 2003 and, despite previously representing Glasgow Kelvin, did not contest a Glasgow seat in 2005. Instead, he stood for the Respect Party in the Greater London constituency of Bethnal Green and Bow, where he used his opposition to the Iraq War and the local Muslim population to gain the seat from Labour. Tottenham MP and Constitutional Affairs Minister David Lammy said he was a carpetbagger who had whipped up racial tensions. After standing down from Bethnal Green and Bow in 2010, he had a two-year hiatus from parliament. In a 2012 by-election, he stood for Respect in the West Yorkshire seat of Bradford West, also with a high local Muslim population, where he made a point of not drinking and again gained the seat from Labour. He lost Bradford West in 2015 to Labour's Naz Shah, after a divisive campaign. Since then, he has made further attempts to parachute himself into constituencies in order to return to parliament. As an independent, he unsuccessfully contested Manchester Gorton in 2017 and West Bromwich East in 2019. He also attempted to be selected as the Brexit Party candidate in the Cambridgeshire seat of Peterborough in a 2019 by-election, but the party selected local businessman Mike Greene.  United States  =U.S. Senate= *Former U.S. Senator Scott Brown ran unsuccessfully as a Republican for U.S. Senate in 2014 in New Hampshire, despite having previously represented Massachusetts in the Senate as recently as two years prior. Brown's family had previously resided in New Hampshire, and he personally owns a vacation home in the state. *Former Reagan administration diplomat Alan Keyes, a resident of Maryland, ran unsuccessfully as a Republican during the 2004 Illinois U.S. Senate election. Notably, he had previously made two unsuccessful runs for the Senate in Maryland. *First Lady Hillary Clinton was elected to the Senate from New York in 2000 after having bought a house in Chappaqua, New York (a wealthy suburb of New York City) in 1999, prior to the election.

The book is edited by Prof Ishtiaq Hussain Qureshi and provides a comprehensive account of the history of the Pakistan region and its people from the prehistory leading to the creation of Pakistan and East Pakistan which then became Bangladesh. Complete set of four volumes are sequentially titled as, Book One: Pre-Muslim Period by Ahmad Hasan Dani; Book Two: Muslim Rule under the Sultans by M. Kabir; Book Three: The Mughul Empire by Sh. A. Rashid; and, Book Four: Alien Rule and the Rise of Muslim Nationalism by M. A. Rahim et al. This book is significant as probably the first serious attempt to paint an overall picture of the early history of Pakistan region. Given that the book deals with periods of history prior to the creation of Pakistan, it has been described as, point of fact, a history of the northern part of the entire Indian subcontinent with special emphasis on the region that presently is Pakistan. Some of the essays have been criticised by peer reviewers as being insufficiently objective about relations between Indian Muslims, Hindus and the British political classes.  Preamble  At the preface, I H Qureshi addresses the common question as to whether it is possible to disentangle the history of Pakistan from the history of India. He maintains that although for certain periods Pakistan shares common history with modern day India, there are periods of regional history with local significance that were actually dominated by the events outside the South Asia, especially in Central Asia and Iranian plateau. There have also been times when the region actually became arbiter of the South Asia's historical destiny.  Critiques on four volumes  = Book One: Pre-Muslim Period by A.H. Dani = Critique by Arthur Llewellyn Basham: Author of the first volume, Prof A. H. Dani is not only an expert archaeologist and prehistorian, but also an able Sanskrit scholar with a very important study of Indian palaeography to his credit. Its interest for the non-Pakistani reader lies chiefly in the attempt to find common factors in the ancient culture of what is now Pakistan. Although a great treasure of ancient Buddhist artefacts is discovered, no significant specimen of Mauryan Empire and Mauryan art is to be found in Pakistan. Gupta Empire also had little influence here. The book has been praised by Basham as \\"a work which no sensible Pakistani or Indian could object to or accuse of undue prejudice\\" = Book Two: Muslim Rule under the Sultans by M. Kabir = Critique by Philip B. Calkins: This volume gives a survey of the history of the Sultanate period. After an introductory chapter which describes some of the sources for the history of the period, nine chapters are devoted to an account of the Sultanate, its Muslim antecedents in Sindh and Afghanistan, and the independent Muslim kingdoms which developed out of it. The final chapter deals with administration, society and culture. Perhaps the most interesting aspect of this volume is historiographical rather than historical, since it is part of a series of Pakistan and Muslims since their arrival in the sub-continent. Calkins, calls for a more deeper analysis of the history than presented in this volume. Despite of the apparent image of \\"the official Pakistani point of view\\" intended to be used as textbook for undergraduate students, the volume should have been able to offer more for those who desire more rudimentary knowledge of sultanate period. He praises the particular aspect of the book as \\"historigraphical rather than historical\\". = Book Three: The Mughal Empire by Sh. A. Rashid = Critique by Fritz Lehman: Given that this book is intended as a textbook for Pakistani undergraduates, Shaikh Ahmed Sarhindi predictably appears as the chief preserver of separate Islamic identity in India, yet only a very general and most inadequate description of his ideas and his influence is given. Chapters on Akbar and Aurangzib are the longest and the most revealing. The tone of the book in general is more reasonable and moderate than such earlier publications. Assessment of the Marathas, for example, while unsympathetic is fair to the facts. Lehman criticises the volume's implications that Muslims living under \\"Hindu rule\\" was \\"the worst disaster in the history of Islam in South Asia\\", a view he describes as 'consistent with the Two-Nation Theory', but one that he finds \\"disquieting\\". = Book Four: Alien Rule and the Rise of Muslim Nationalism by M. A. Rahim et al. = Critique by Aziz Ahmed: Determination of national identity quite understandably tends to be re- evaluation of history. The educator‚Äôs job is to make such re-evaluation available to the university student. It needs further analysis whether the Hindu officials of the Bengal Nawwabs conspired with the East India Company because they were Hindus or because, like Muslim officials, they were simply greedy. Ahmad criticises this volume as a \\"warped subjectivity\\", and the portrayal of British rule in the region as \\"merely the lesser weakness of Rahim's historical presentation. His greater weakness is a complete lack of objectivity\\". According to the reviewer, the book portrays Hindus and the British as \\"villains\\" and Muslims as \\"victims\\". He further writes that the narrative is \\"dangerous\\" for it will not guide younger historians in Pakistan towards proper national self-criticism.

Redeveloped from the old Government Stadium, it reopened as Hong Kong Stadium in March 1994. It has a maximum seating capacity of 40,000, including 18,260 at the main level, 3,173 at executive level, 18,510 upper level seats and 57 seats for wheelchair users. The stadium is located in So Kon Po, Hong Kong Island, in valley Causeway Bay. Most international football matches held in Hong Kong are held at this stadium. It is also the location for the Hong Kong Sevens rugby sevens tournament. Hong Kong Stadium also hosted the Rugby World Cup Sevens twice, in 1997 and 2005. History So Kon Po was formerly the burial ground for the 1918 fire at Happy Valley Racecourse. Then the Hong Kong Government moved all the tombs to Aberdeen. The old Government Stadium was a U-shaped constructed by 1953 and had a capacity of 28,000Takungpao, 1956-09-05, page 8 with partially covered seating. The old Government Stadium was only partially covered, without sufficient seats or lighting systems. In the 90s, the Royal Hong Kong Jockey Club proposed a reconstruction plan so that Hong Kong can have a world class sports stadium. In 2008, 39,000http://news.bbc.co.uk/sport1/hi/rugby_union/7694689.stm people attended the first Bledisloe Cup rugby union match between Australia and New Zealand.

No running track was built due to the restricted land size. This forced the schools to look for alternative venues. The stadium's management contract was won by Wembley International, a foreign subsidiary of Wembley Stadium, against strong competition, in March 1994. From the first day there have been serious problems with the pitch. The owners of the stadium, the Urban Council, were disappointed. It came under fire from local football officials, sports promoters and even Manchester United manager Alex Ferguson, who said, before the exhibition match between Manchester United and South China AA on 20 July 1997, \\"The pitch is cutting up. The surface is just sand- based and the turf doesn't hold well. Injuries can occur.\\"Major overhaul on the cards for troubled stadium The government had hoped that the stadium could be used as a music concert venue in order to bring in more rental income. But nearby citizens complained endlessly about 'noise levels', leading to restrictions on noise levels that effectively rendered the stadium unsuitable for concerts. This reduced greatly the income levels of the stadium and the management company, Wembley, ran into financial troubles. =1998 Hong Kong government takeover= Wembley's management tenure at the stadium was abruptly terminated by the Provisional Urban Council (PUC) on 26 May 1998. PUC also asked Urban Services Department (USD) to assume temporary management of the Hong Kong Stadium and has also agreed to USD's proposals to returf the entire pitch of the Hong Kong Stadium. The fundamental issue between the parties was the care and maintenance of the stadium pitch, but also a complaint about an unauthorized bungy jump by Canadian Paul G. Boyle. In the end, the Hong Kong government was judged to have wrongfully terminated the management agreement and had to pay over HK$20million in damages to Wembley Plc. Hong Kong Stadium is now managed by the Leisure and Cultural Services Department of Hong Kong, after the Urban Council was disbanded.

Rugby  On 1 November 2008, the ground became the first stadium outside of Australia or New Zealand to host a match of the Bledisloe Cup, a rugby competition between Australia and New Zealand. New Zealand won the match, 19-14. On 1 June 2013, the British and Irish Lions and Barbarian F.C. played a rugby union match at the Hong Kong Stadium.  Hong Kong International Cricket Sixes  The ground has hosted matches of the Hong Kong International Cricket Sixes since 1996 to 1997. 2009 East Asian Games The stadium was used as the final venue for both the Rugby 7s and Football tournaments of the 2009 East Asian Games. Hong Kong's rugby 7s team and football team both made the final against Japan. The rugby 7s team finished second to Japan. While the football team defeated them in front of over 31,000 spectators, including Donald Tsang, winning the Hong Kong football team‚Äôs first ever international title.  2013 muddy turf fiasco  In 2013, during the Barclays Asia Trophy, Sunderland manager Paolo Di Canio described the pitch as \\"a killer\\", while Manchester City centre-back Matija Nastasiƒá is injured on the mudheap pitch, although Nastasiƒá's injury was caused by a kick to the ankle according to City manager Manuel Pellegrini, who refused to blame the muddy pitch. Tottenham Hotspur manager Andr√© Villas-Boas was also critical of the pitch after Jan Vertonghen, a first-choice Spurs defender, incurred an ankle injury playing on the surface. \\"If I can be sincere, I would prefer not to play, but this is the reality that we have to face,\\" said the Portuguese on the eve of his side's friendly against South China AA. Manchester United then cancelled their public training session at the stadium on Sunday amid concerns over the playing surface, did not want to further damage the playing surface or risk any injuries to their players, ahead of their exhibition match with Kitchee SC on 29 July.https://www.scmp.com/news/hong-kong/article/1292720/hong-kong-stadium- mudbath-blamed-own-goal-bosses On 30 July, the director of leisure and cultural services, Betty Fung Ching Suk-yee said returfing the much-criticised Hong Kong Stadium pitch is being considered, after football fans worldwide slammed the sodden, muddy surface during Barclays Asia Trophy matches on 24 and 27 July. South China FC chairman Steven Lo said in an official blog that recent matches have exposed a serious management problem. Chief Executive Leung Chun-ying said he has asked the Home Affairs Bureau and the Leisure and Cultural Services Department for short, medium and long-term remedies. In 2015, with support from the Jockey Club, the pitch was completely returfed. The existing turf and soil was removed, the irrigation and drainage systems replaced, and new turf laid. Non-sports events Jean-Michel Jarre held a concert at the Hong Kong Stadium in 11 March 1994. It was the first event after the re-construction of the Hong Kong Stadium. Alan Tam held a concert at the Hong Kong Stadium from 22 to 24 April 1994. It was the first local artist held here. Scout Rally The only time the venue is used for live events is the Extravaganza of China Olympic Gold Medallists celebration show for the Chinese gold medallists. Bon Jovi played a concert at the stadium on 25 September 1993 during I'll Sleep When I'm Dead Tour. It was their first concert in Hong Kong. Canadian Paul G. Boyle illegally bungy jumped from the roof of the Hong Kong Stadium on the morning of Friday 24 May 1996. He was not arrested but was given a lifetime ban from all Urban Council facilities. Future At the 2013 Policy Address, Chief Executive Leung Chun Ying said once the Kai Tak Stadium is operational in 2019, the Hong Kong Stadium will be turned into a 10,000 capacity district sports arena. Facilities Hong Kong Stadium can accommodate 40,000. The spread is as below: * 18,256 at Main level * 18,507 at Upper levels * 3,153 at Executive levels * 57 wheelchair spaces In addition, there are many refreshment kiosks inside the stadium. Other use The stadium was supposed to be a multi purpose entertainment and sports venue, due to its much greater capacity compared to the other popular and over used Hong Kong Coliseum, where nearly all uses are now strictly for popular entertainment. However, its open-air nature has led to noise complaints from residents in tower blocks surrounding the stadium. It has not been allowed to host entertainment events since 1999.

The hospital was formed in 1998 from the amalgamation of four separate institutions ‚Äì the Queen Street Mental Health Centre, the Clarke Institute of Psychiatry, the Addiction Research Foundation, and the Donwood Institute. It is Canada's largest mental health teaching hospital, and the only stand-alone psychiatric emergency department in Ontario. CAMH has 90 distinct clinical services across inpatient, outpatient, day treatment, and partial hospitalization models. CAMH has been the site of major advancements in psychiatric research, including the discovery of the Dopamine receptor D2.  History  CAMH was formed from the 1998 merger of the Queen Street Mental Health Centre with the Clarke Institute of Psychiatry, Addiction Research Foundation, and Donwood Institute.Scrivener, Leslie (February 25, 2007). Breakout at the asylum. Toronto Star =Queen Street Mental Health Centre= Queen Street Asylum for the Insane, 1910 The Provincial Lunatic Asylum opened on January 26, 1850. It was subsequently renamed Asylum for the Insane, then Hospital for the Insane, then Ontario Hospital (1919), and then the Queen Street Mental Health Centre (1966). It had also been called the Toronto Lunatic Asylum and 999 Queen Street West.Everett, Barbara (2000). A Fragile Revolution: Consumers and Psychiatric Survivors Confront the Power of the Mental Health System. Wilfrid Laurier University Press. The original buildings were constructed in a series of rigid lines and sharp angles, consistent with the belief at the time that orderly physical structure would facilitate orderly mental states for the patients. High walls segregated the patients from the community, establishing a long-standing stigma about the facility. The Queen Street Site of CAMH contained the Samuel A. Malcolmson Lecture Theatre, named for the site's Chief Psychiatrist and Clinical Director of Forensics. In 2009, however, Malcolmson was subject to a disciplinary hearing of Ontario's College of Physicians and Surgeons, following that he sexually abused a patient and fathered a child with her. Malcomson pleaded \\"no contest\\" and resigned his license to practice. The lecture hall was renamed the Queen Street Auditorium. Reforms were made after a series of deaths at the Queen Street Mental Health Centre and newspaper accounts of involuntary drug treatment, electroshock therapy, and prison-like conditions. =Clarke Institute of Psychiatry= CAMH College Street site The institute was founded in 1966 and officially opened by Ontario Premier John P. Robarts. It was named the Clarke Institute of Psychiatry, after Charles Kirk Clarke, a pioneer in mental health in Canada. The institute took over the clinical, teaching, and research functions of the Toronto Psychiatric Hospital, located at 2 Surrey Place, which opened in 1925 under Clarence B. Farrar. The Institute served as the main psychiatry teaching hospital for the University of Toronto and was the headquarters for the Department of Psychiatry in the Faculty of Medicine. The first Medical and Executive Director of the Clarke was Charles Roberts, and the first Psychiatrist-in- Chief (and Professor and Head of the Department of Psychiatry at the University of Toronto) was Aldwyn B. Stokes. When Stokes retired in 1967, the administration was reorganized, and Robin Hunter became Medical Director and Psychiatrist-in-Chief. Fredrick H. Lowy served as Psychiatrist-in-Chief of the Clarke from 1974 until 1980, followed by Vivian Rakoff from 1980 to 1990, and Paul E. Garfinkel from 1990 until the Clarke's 1998 merger into CAMH. Upon its merger into CAMH in 1998, the Clarke building become known as the CAMH College Street site. Conrad Black has been a generous supporter of the Clarke Institute of Psychiatry.  Rent increase In 2015, CAMH's facilities at the College St. site were put in jeopardy following notice of a rent increase from $1.2 million to $4 million per year, at the renewal of its 20-year lease. CAMH valued its property at $25 million, whereas the hospital's landlord, Brookfield Asset Management, valued it at $100 million. Brookfield turned down CBC's interview requests. A government arbitrator was appointed who valued the properly at $55 million, yielding a rent increase that CAMH was reportedly able to pay. =Addiction Research Foundation= The Addiction Research Foundation (ARF), then named the Alcoholism Research Foundation was founded in 1949, when H. David Archibald, who had studied at the School of Alcohol Studies at Yale University, was hired by the Liquor Control Board of Ontario. His mandate was to determine the scope of alcoholism in Ontario. He was named executive director when ARF opened and remained in that post until 1976. Focusing initially on outpatient treatment, their first facility was Brookside Hospital in 1951, expanding to branch offices and new locations in 1954, the same year they set up in-house research. In 1961, formally renamed the Alcoholism and Drug Addiction Research Foundation of Ontario, ARF expanded its mission to include drugs. In 1971, they expanded to a clinical teaching hospital called the Clinical Research and Treatment Institute. In 1978 ARF opened the School for Addiction Studies and expanded their international role in policy development and research. Following provincial hospital restructuring in the 1990s, ARF was folded in 1998 into CAMH.Blocker JS, Fahey DM, Tyrrell IR. Alcohol and temperance in modern history: an international encyclopedia. ABC-CLIO 2003. pp. 3‚Äì4. =Donwood Institute= In 1946, R. Gordon Bell opened a clinic in his own home for people needing mental health services. There existed an Ontario statute allowing doctors to take up to four patients into their homes without a hospital license. To his surprise, his only patients all suffered from alcoholism. It soon became necessary to move to larger facilities. To expand capacity, Bell opened Shadow Brook, which operated from 1947 to 1954, and then the Bell Clinic, which operated from 1954 to 1966. The Donwood Institute then opened in 1967, with 47 beds and a 4-month waiting list in the 1980s. Still focused on substance abuse, it claimed a 65% recovery rate for general population and an 85% recovery rate among physicians with addictions. =CAMH redevelopment= CAMH has been undergoing a three phase redevelopment centered at its Queen Street site, with four goals: 1) Deliver a new model of care and provide a healthy environment that promotes recovery; 2) Bring together the best research, clinical, education, health promotion, and policy experts in one place to change the future of mental health and addictions; 3) Revitalize the City of Toronto by opening up their site and by creating an inclusive new nine-block neighbourhood that benefits all and, 4) Change attitudes by breaking down barriers to eliminate the stigma of mental health. Phase 1A was undertaken by Eastern Construction and completed in 2008 and Phase 1B was undertaken by Carillion and completed in 2012. Phase 1C is being undertaken by PCL Construction and is expected to be complete in 2020. In 2008, CAMH announced the completion of four new buildings (forming Phase 1A of the project) to accommodate CAMH's Addiction and Mood & Anxiety Programs. The Campbell Family Mental Health Research Institute was established with a $30 million donation in 2011 from Linda Campbell, Gaye Farncombe, and Susan Grange, each granddaughters of Canadian magnate Roy Thomson and nieces of Ken Thomson. CAMH CEO, Catherine Zahn, said research on the brain is the most promising pathway to progress in mental illness research. Bell donated $10 million to CAMH in 2011, reportedly the largest corporate gift in Canada to mental illness. In 2012, CAMH announced the completion of three new buildings (forming Phase 1B of the project): the Bell Gateway Building for the central administration, a utilities and parking building, and the Intergenerational Wellness Centre which includes 12 new beds for youth ages 14‚Äì18. Margaret McCain, the former lieutenant-governor of New Brunswick and widow of McCain Foods co-founder Wallace McCain, donated $10 million to CAMH in 2012 to establish the Margaret and Wallace McCain Centre for Child, Youth and Family Mental Health. In 2013, the Slaight Family donated to $50 million to health care institutions, of which CAMH received $10 million. The donation permitted the opening of a centre dedicated to identifying and treating early signs of mental illness in youth. In 2014, philanthropist and business executive Andrew Fass donated $1,000,000 to CAMH for the hospital to create a wellness program for its staff. In 2016, Fass withdrew his donation, saying that CAMH was unable to show how they were spending the money. The grant was to be used for CAMH's \\"Well@Work\\" program, an initiative to provide Canadian workplaces with training to identify risks of mental illness and strategies to support employees in need. CAMH opened the Emergency Department in 2014, funded by a $2.5 million private donation and a $4.2 million grant from the Ontario Ministry of Health and Long-Term Care. In 2016, CAMH constructed a sweat lodge for Aboriginal patients in order to promote spiritual, physical, and emotional healing. Also in 2016, CAMH opened walk-in clinics for youth. Research CAMH reports being the largest research facility in Canada for mental health and addictions, including over 100 scientists over 150 research trainees. In the 2014-2015 fiscal year, CAMH received $44,384,230 in research funding and published more than 500 research articles. Administration Psychiatrist and Clarke Institute President Paul E. Garfinkel was appointed the first President and CEO of CAMH in 1998. He was followed by neurologist Catherine Zahn in 2009. Upon CAMH's formation, Peter Catford was appointed Vice President for Information Technology. In 2002, Catford outsourced the public hospital's computer needs to H.I. Next, a private company which Catford founded and co-owned. When the Toronto Star reported on what it deemed an apparent conflict of interest regarding the spending of public money, the hospital would not reveal how much it paid Catford or his company, nor would CAMH disclose any details of its contract with H.I. Next or what other firms bid on the work. Catford commented only that \\"I feel honoured to work with (CAMH) and I feel like it has been done ethically.\\" In interviews with the Toronto Star, Dev Chopra, executive vice- president of CAMH first said there was nothing inappropriate about Catford's role. \\"We got into it with our eyes open. There is no conflict.\\" However, Chopra later said there were \\"some optics from a conflict perspective\\" noting the hospital might revisit the issue that day. Catford left his CAMH position two days later, but the Star reported that hospital officials said changes were being considered months before the Star published its story about the issue.  Criticisms  CAMH's administration has come under criticism including from staff who report safety problems and from donors who withdrew their funding citing accountability problems. =David Healy Affair= Soon after CAMH was founded, its administration was embroiled in a scandal involving Eli Lilly and Company, which donated $1.5 million to CAMH, and David Healy, a prominent critic of Prozac, the widely used antidepressant manufactured by Eli Lilly. CAMH hired Healy to be the head of its Mood and Anxiety Program, but withdrew the job offer after hearing about Healy's views. CAMH aggressively recruited Healy, and CAMH Physician-in-Chief, David Goldbloom, offered Healy a job as the head of the Mood and Anxiety Program. Healy accepted and soon after gave a lecture in which he reiterated his views about Prozac increasing risk of suicide. A few days later, Goldbloom withdrew the job offer, saying \\"Essentially, we believe that it is not a good fit between you and the role as leader of an academic program in mood and anxiety disorders at the centre and in relation to the university‚Ä¶.We do not feel your approach is compatible with the goals for development of the academic and clinical resource that we have.\\" The decision caused an \\"uproar\\" among Canadian academics, with the Canadian Association of University Teachers calling CAMH actions \\"an affront to academic freedom in Canada.\\" Scientists from 13 countries, including Nobel laureates Julius Axelrod and Arvid Carlsson, protested CAMH's actions as did the Society for Academic Freedom and Scholarship (SAFS). Healy sued CAMH and the University of Toronto, alleging breach of contract, defamation, and denial of academic freedom. The lawsuit sought damages of $9.4 million, including $2.6 million from CAMH CEO Paul Garfinkel, and $1.4 million from the U of T Dean of Medicine. The university distanced itself from CAMH: According to U of T President, Robert Birgeneau, \\"Everyone is trying to blame the university for something that happened at one of our hospitals.\\" The lawsuit was settled with Healy receiving an appointment as visiting professor as the University of Toronto. The president of the Canadian Association of University Teachers, Vic Catano, said \\"We see the settlement as a complete vindication for Dr. Healy.\\" =Child Gender Identity Clinic= In 1975, psychiatrist Susan Bradley founded a clinic in CAMH to work with gender dysphoric children. Bradley collaborated for many years with psychologist Kenneth Zucker, and they established the clinic as the largest gender identity service in Canada and an international center for research. In their studies, 80% of the children grow out of the behavior. They therefore use different approaches with children than adolescents because, over time, children are more likely to identify with their birth sex. Regarding adolescents, Zucker \\"will support a teenager or adult who wants to transition using hormones and surgeries.\\" Regarding children, however, Zucker says \\"We are trying to help a child feel more comfortable with the gender identity that matches their birth sex\\" and that they use a variety of techniques to \\"help a child think more flexibly\\" about their gender. According to The New York Times, Zucker does this by \\"encouraging same-sex friendships and activities like board games that move beyond strict gender roles.\\" He said a child could be asked to make a list of pros and cons about being different genders so that the child realizes that \\"there are both good and not so good things about being a boy and being a girl.\\" Activists have criticized Zucker's approach, claiming that it amounts to a form of conversion therapy. In 2015, following complaints from activists, CAMH commissioned an external review of the clinic. The review was inconclusive, reporting it \\"cannot state that the clinic does not practice reparative approaches.\\" Upon the release of the report, CAMH announced that it was closing the clinic and that Zucker was no longer at CAMH. Activists celebrated the news, calling upcoming community consultations \\"a major step toward establishing a service that will support families, and hopefully receive government funding to do so.\\" A petition of over 500 sexuality and gender diversity experts decried it, calling CAMH's decisions \\"politically motivated\\" and showing an \\"indifference to research and scholarship.\\" In 2018, CAMH paid Zucker $586,000 and issued a public apology as part of a settlement. =Forensics= CAMH's forensic department and its leadership have been the subject of criticism from Ontario judges and the public for issues including public safety, patient civil rights violations, and turning away patients ordered to CAMH by judges. This culminated in Ontario Superior Court Justice Maureen Forestell who reportedly \\"tore a strip off of\\" CAMH for its actions. Dr. Graham Glancy, a forensic psychiatrist at the Maplehurst Correctional Complex accused CAMH of focusing too much on patients and treatments to enhance its international reputation, but at the expense of the less glamorous forensic patients. He added \\"Cities like Ottawa and London are better resourced but Toronto is terrible. It's a disgrace, really.\\" Toronto defence counsel Chris Hynes also attributed the problems to the CAMH leadership, saying \\"CAMH front-line workers pay the price for decisions made by the centre's privatized board of directors.\\" AWOL patients One recurrent issue has been the number of violent or dangerous patients who escape custody from CAMH's forensic wards. After filing a freedom of information act request with the police, the Toronto Star reported that CAMH had nearly as many AWOLs as all other Toronto hospitals combined (2,060 and 2,371 for the period 2004 to 2014). One of the most widely reported incidents involved Thomas Brailsford, who was institutionalized at CAMH after beheading his mother and being deemed a \\"danger to himself and others.\\" Brailsford took off from a taxicab on his way to a medical appointment, representing his second escape in a year. In an interview with Toronto columnist Jerry Agar, CAMH's chief of forensic psychiatry, Sandy Simpson said \\"Clearly, we will be reviewing this carefully to look at how we assessed the risk in this case.\\" Kate Richards of CAMH media relations subsequently said \\"We have tightened aspects of these procedures and...We are confident that the changes implemented in this case have been effective.\\" Agar wrote that he has \\"been eager to have Simpson back on the radio show to discuss what measures have been put in place\\" but had not received any response. Five months later, CAMH told Agar \\"Dr. Simpson is not available for a follow-up interview.\\" = Workplace safety = In 2007, following a series of attacks on staff by patients, the Ontario Ministry of Labour asked CAMH to develop a workplace violence and policy program. In 2008, the Ministry of Labour laid nine workplace safety charges against CAMH in response to allegations by staff that they had been attacked by patients. CAMH was fined $70,000 in 2009 for two attacks against nursing staff in 2007 and 2008. In 2014, the Ontario Ministry of Labour laid charges against CAMH for failing to protect workers from workplace violence following an attack earlier that year. In 2014, the Ontario Ministry of Labour laid more charges against CAMH for failing to implement procedures to protect staff from workplace violence following another attack that year. The prosecution asked the court to send ‚Äúa clear message‚Äù that the CAMH situation was unacceptable. CAMH was found guilty and fined again. CAMH‚Äôs Chief of Nursing, Rani Srivastava, said that CAMH accepted the court‚Äôs decision adding that the violence had a ‚Äúdevastating impact‚Äù on ‚Äúall of us at CAMH.‚Äù Three months later, another nurse was punched, kicked in the face, and dragged into a locked utility room where she was repeatedly kicked in the head, suffering fractures and nerve damage. Vicki McKenna of the Ontario Nurses' Association reported that CAMH has not been taking part in government committees to improve workplace safety and called for CAMH senior management to be held personally responsible for the continued workplace violence. Rani Srivastava said that the incident was \\"completely unexpected,\\" that CAMH is \\"saddened\\" and \\"shocked\\" by what happened, and that \\"any incident is one too many.\\" =Reporting failures= Simpson has also been criticized by the Ontario Review Board for secluding a patient for two months but not informing the board, as required. Simpson claimed that the regulation \\"was unclear\\" about whether CAMH had a duty to report what it was doing. The board disagreed, ruling against CAMH. Public policy statements CAMH issues statements about local and provincial regulations on addictive behaviors. =Alcohol= CAMH policy opposes the privatization of alcohol sales, citing evidence that the increase in availability increases alcohol-related harms and associated costs. They supported that the Liquor Control Board of Ontario should maintain its monopoly on alcohol sales. CAMH referred to \\"the plan to allow the sale of VQA wines at farmers' markets across the province\\" as \\"cause for concern\\" because it would increase access to alcohol. Similarly, together with other health organizations, CAMH called for a provincial alcohol strategy, ahead of Ontario's plan to permit the sale of beer in grocery stores. =Marijuana= In a 2014 policy document, CAMH expressed support for the legalization of marijuana with strict control regulations. According to CAMH CEO, Catherine Zahn, \\"Only through legalization can we implement a public-health approach, treating cannabis use as a health issue and not one to be addressed through law enforcement and the court system. This is the approach we take with tobacco and alcohol. As with alcohol, a legal cannabis market can be regulated with controls that address risk factors associated with use\\". =Gambling= CAMH has opposed the expansion of Toronto's Woodbine Racetrack. In a policy statement, CAMH said increased availability of gambling results in increased harms and predicted that a large portion of any increased revenues from the racetrack would come from people with gambling problems.

Based on the true story of a Toronto bank employee who embezzled more than $10 million to feed his gambling habit, Owning Mahowny was named one of the ten best films of the year by critic Roger Ebert. Plot Between 1980 and 1982, Toronto bank employee Dan Mahowny (Philip Seymour Hoffman) is given access to bigger and bigger accounts with his promotion to assistant branch manager. His boss trusts him, but is unaware that Mahowny is a compulsive gambler. Mahowny is soon skimming larger and larger amounts for his own use and making weekly trips to Atlantic City, where he is treated like a king by a competent casino manager (John Hurt). Mahowny's girlfriend, fellow bank employee Belinda (Minnie Driver), cannot understand what is happening. Mahowny's criminal acts come to light when Toronto police begin to investigate his longtime bookie Frank (Maury Chaykin). The movie's focus is on Mahowny as a character‚Äîhow his compulsion drives him and all the domino effects it has on the rest of his life. The love story between Mahowny and Belinda and the inclusion of other finely drawn characters such as hapless casino employee Bernie (Chris Collins) put the emphasis squarely on the gambling addiction, not on the flash and sizzle of big casinos or multimillion-dollar frauds.

J. Kang as Secretary Production =Development= Owning Mahowny is based on a real-life incident: Canadian Imperial Bank of Commerce clerk Brian Molony embezzled over $10 million from his employers in just 18 months to support his gambling habit. Molony's story was told in the best-selling 1987 book Stung by journalist Gary Ross, which formed the basis for the screenplay. In an interview on the web site of Stung publishers McClelland and Stewart, Ross says he has kept in touch with Molony and updated what happened to him after the events portrayed in the movie. Molony served six years in prison after pleading guilty to fraud. He has not gambled since his arrest, has married his girlfriend, has three sons and works as a financial consultant. Molony was a manager at the Canadian Imperial Bank of Commerce, with access to significant resources. Upon the discovery of his gambling addiction and his crime, he was prosecuted in Canada by Crown Attorney Peter DeJulio. Molony was defended by the late Edward Greenspan. He received a sentence of six years imprisonment, as sought by the Crown. The Canadian Imperial Bank of Commerce took court action to recover funds from casinos in Atlantic City that enabled Mr. Malony's gambling addiction. The case was settled for an undisclosed sum. Reception =Critical response= On Rotten Tomatoes the film has a score of 79% based on reviews from 96 critics, with an average rating of 6.99/10. On Metacritic the film has a score of 70% based on reviews from 29 critics, indicating \\"generally favorable reviews\\".

Review by Roger Ebert, May 16, 2003. and assessed Hoffman's performance as \\"a masterpiece of discipline and precision\\", calling him a \\"fearless poet of implosion, [who] plays the role with a fierce integrity, never sending out signals for our sympathy because he knows that Mahowny is oblivious to our presence.\\" However, some critics believed that in his self-effacing performance, Hoffman refused to conform to expectations of a typical movie character and that the movie suffered as a result. Stephanie Zacharek considered him to be a \\"character who squirms right out of our grasp\\", and despite being the movie's anchor, he's \\"such a vaporous one, he leaves us feeling adrift\\". Asked whether Philip Seymour Hoffman's portrayal matched with the real Brian Molony, journalist Gary Ross replied, \\"Remarkably so. They have the same stocky build, bushy moustache, glasses, slightly unkempt look, and earnestness. And Philip somehow managed to assimilate the psychic essence of Molony ‚Äî a yawning emptiness that nothing except gambling was able to fill.\\" Owning Mahowny earned $1 million, significantly less than its $10 million budget. =Awards= Owning Mahowny received nominations for Best Motion Picture, Best Performance by an Actor in a Leading Role, Best Screenplay (Adapted) and Best Achievement in Music ‚Äî Original Score (Richard Grassby- Lewis, Jon Hassell) at the 24th Genie Awards.

The Hornet replaced the compact Rambler American marking the end of the Rambler marque in the American and Canadian markets. Hornets were marketed in foreign markets and were assembled under license agreements between AMC ‚Äî for example, with Veh√≠culos Automotores Mexicanos (VAM), Australian Motor Industries (AMI), and by Toyota S.A. Ltd. in South Africa. The Hornet became an important vehicle and platform for AMC, serving the company in one form or another for eighteen years, until the 1988 model year. It would outlast other compact platforms from the competition, including the Chevrolet Nova, Ford Maverick, and Plymouth Valiant. The Hornet was also the basis for AMC's Gremlin, Concord, Spirit, and all-wheel drive AMC Eagle. The AMC Hornet served as an experimental platform for alternative fuel and other automotive technologies. Hornets were campaigned in various motorsports events with some corporate support. A hatchback model also starred in an exceptional stunt jump in the 1974 James Bond film: The Man with the Golden Gun.  Origins of the \\"Hornet\\" name  The Hornet nameplate goes back to the mid-1950s. The name originated from the merger of Hudson Motor Company and Nash-Kelvinator Corporation in 1954. Hudson introduced the first Hudson Hornet in 1951. The automaker formed a stock car racing team centered on the car, and the \\"Fabulous Hudson Hornet\\" soon became famous for its wins and stock-car title sweeps between 1951 and 1954. American Motors, the resulting corporation formed by the merger of Nash Motors and Hudson, continued to produce Nash-based Hornets, which were sold under the Hudson marque from 1955 to 1957. The automaker retained rights to the name while it was dormant from 1958 to 1969. The rights to the \\"Hornet\\" nameplate then passed to Chrysler with that company's acquisition of AMC in 1987.  History  AMC Hornet badge 1971 SC360 and 1972 Hornet Sportabout The Hornet's styling was based on the AMC Cavalier and Vixen show cars. The Hornet, as well as the Ford Maverick, were considered a response by the domestic automakers to battle with the imports. Development of the new model took AMC three years, a million man-hours, and US$40 million. The Hornet was an all-new design sharing no major body components, but utilizing some of the Rambler American's chassis and drivetrain. An all-new front suspension with anti-brake dive was developed for AMC's large-sized \\"senior\\" 1970 models, and instead of developing lighter components for the new compact-size platform, the same parts were incorporated into the Hornet. Introduced in 1969 for the 1970 model year, the Hornet was the first car in a line of new models that AMC would introduce over the following three years, and it set the tone for what designer Dick Teague and chief executive officer Roy D. Chapin, Jr., had in mind for the company for the 1970s. The Hornet marked the return of AMC to its original role as a \\"niche\\" marketer specializing in small cars. It also became one of AMCs best sellers. With its manufacturers suggested retail price (MSRP) of US$1,994 for the base model, the Hornet was an economical small family car. However, it took design cues from the popular Ford Mustang and Chevrolet Camaro, and the company's own Javelin with a long hood, short rear deck, and sporty looks. The Hornet's wheelbase platform (two inches or 5.08 centimeters longer than its predecessor, the Rambler American) evolved into a number of other models (including the four-wheel-drive Eagle) and was produced through 1988. The Hornet was initially available in a choice of two thrifty straight- six engines or a V8. The Hornet was offered as a two-door and four-door notchback sedan in its introductory year. The hardtop (no \\"B\\" pillar) coupe body style was not continued from the 1969 Rambler American. A four-door station wagon variant named the \\"Sportabout\\" was added to the 1971 lineup. Also for 1971, the SC/360 was added. This was a V8 powered compact muscle car that was available only as a two-door sedan. (The tire pressure sticker on the first 1970 models hinted at the SC/360). For 1973, a semi-fastback hatchback coupe with fold-down rear seats was added to the lineup. AMC used the Hornet as the basis for its AMC Gremlin, which consisted of the front half of the two-door Hornet's body and a truncated rear section with a window hatchback. In 1973 a Levi's Jeans trim package ‚Äì based on the world-famous jeans manufacturer ‚Äì was added. The Levi's trim package was popular and was available for several years. The Hornet station wagon version was offered for two model years with a luxury trim package designed by Italian fashion designer Dr. Aldo Gucci. It is notable for being one of the first American cars to offer an upscale fashion \\"designer\\" trim level. The AMC Hornet was also the first U.S. made automobile to feature guardrail beam doors to protect occupants in the event of a side impact. The Hornet was phased out after 1977 and transformed into a new \\"luxury compact\\" line of automobiles, the AMC Concord. It also served as the basis of an innovative \\"crossover\\" all-wheel drive vehicle, the AMC Eagle that was introduced in 1979.  Year-by-year changes  = 1970 = Introduced in September 1969, the first year Hornets came in \\"base\\" and higher trim SST models, and in 2 and 4-door sedans. The straight-6 engine was standard on the base models with the standard on the SST. The V8 engine was optional. The annual new car issue of Popular Science introduced the 1970 model by entitling its article: \\"Rambler is dead ‚Äì long live the Hornet!\\" The authors not only compared the new Hornet with the outgoing Rambler American, but also with its primary competition, the Ford Maverick and finding the Hornet better to Ford's new model in several factors that are significant to consumers, as well as \\"certainly superior among economy cars\\" in ride-and-handling and \\"way ahead\\" in performance. Popular Mechanics road test of a SST model with V8 engine and automatic transmission summarized the findings in the article's sub-title: \\"it has a lot of good things in a not-too-small package.\\" Popular Science conducted a road test of four of the lowest-priced U.S. cars (AMC Hornet, Ford Maverick, Plymouth Duster, and Chevrolet Nova) describing the 1970 Hornet offering more interior and trunk room, excellent visibility in all directions, achieved the highest fuel economy, needed the optional disk brakes, and the authors concluded that it was the \\"practical family car ... better value than any of the others\\". : 1970 production: :: 2-door base: 43,610 :: 4-door base: 17,948 :: 2-door SST: 19,748 :: 4-door SST: 19,786 = 1971 = The 1971 model year was the introduction of the Sportabout, a 4-door wagon using a steeply sloped back design with a single liftgate-type hatch. The styling was well-executed to appear muscular and purposeful while the liftgate-type station wagon appeared revolutionary in an era of traditional and upright rear tailgates. All featured a \\"Sportabout\\" emblem at the rear of the bodysides. The 2- and 4-door sedans were carryovers. The I6 engine was now standard across the range. A marketing promotion in the Spring made available a new fabric folding sunroof on specially equipped Hornets, as well as on the Gremlin. The opening roof feature was included with the purchase of whitewall tires, custom wheel covers, pinstripes or rally stripes, a light group, and a special visibility group.  SC360  1971 AMC Hornet SC 360 Interior of the 1971 AMC Hornet SC360 compact muscle car A notable addition was the SC360 version, a compact 2-door muscle car that was intended as a follow-up to the 1969 SC Rambler. Powered by the AMC's V8, the SC was distinguished by styled wheels, body striping, individual fully reclining front seats as well as other performance and appearance upgrades. In standard form, with two-barrel carburetor, the 360 produced (gross) and was priced at just US$2,663 (about $40 below the 1971 Plymouth Duster 340). This combination was offered by AMC to achieve a 12.5:1 weight to horsepower ratio for insurance rate calculations. With the addition of the $199 \\"Go\\" package's four-barrel carburetor and ram-air induction, the SC's power increased to . Optional in place of the standard three-speed was a Hurst-shifted GM Borg-Warner Super T10 four-speed, or an automatic transmission. Goodyear Polyglas D70x14 blackwall tires were standard, with upgrades including white lettered tires, a heavy-duty suspension package, and the Spicer \\"Twin-Grip\\" limited slip differential with 3.54:1 or 3.90:1 gears. Although the SC/360 could not compete with the holdover big-engined muscle cars, the SC combined respectable quickness (0 to 60 mph in 6.7 seconds and the quarter mile (1320 feet, 402 m) dragstrip in 14.9 at with a taut suspension, big tires, and modest size; thus Motor Trend magazine described it as \\"just a plain gas to drive ... it handles like a dream.\\" Hot Rod magazine ran the 1/4 mile an SC360 with automatic transmission weighing in 14.80 seconds at 94.63 mph in \\"bone-stock form\\" and predicted that high 13s could be achieved \\"with little more than a rejet and recurve of the carb and distributor.\\" The authors also praised the car's handling and braking by summarizing: \\"Unbelievable. I think it's some great little car!\\" Car Craft magazine testers bolted on better tires, headers, and traction bars to run the 1/4 mile in 13.78 seconds at . The muscle car market segment reached the height of popularity in 1970, but the combination of rising fuel and insurance prices along with emerging emissions reductions meant the end of an era. American Motors originally planned to build as many as 10,000 of the cars, but high insurance premiums killed the SC/360 after a single year's production of just 784 examples. A total of 304 were built with the now-preferred combination of a 4-speed manual transmission and a 4-barrel carburetor. The Sportabout, on the other hand, was the most popular model by far, outselling all other Hornet models combined in its debut year. For most of its production, it was the only American-made station wagon in its size class. : 1971 production: :: 2-door base: 19,395 :: 4-door base: 10,403 :: 2-door SST: 8,600 :: 4-door SST: 10,651 :: Wagon SST: 73,471 :: SC360: 784 = 1972 = 1972 Hornet Sportabout 1972 Hornet SST sedan American Motors established a new focus on quality with the 1972 model year. The \\"Buyer Protection Plan\\", was the industry's first 12-month or comprehensive, bumper-to-bumper warranty. This innovative AMC Buyer Protection Plan included numerous mechanical upgrades to increase durability, as well as a focus on quality in sourcing and production. The 1972 Hornet was promoted by AMC as \\"a Tough Little Car\\". American Motors promised to repair anything wrong with the car (except for the tires), owners were provided with a toll-free telephone number to the company and a free loaner car if a warranty repair took overnight. To consolidate AMC's product offering, reduce production costs, and offer more value to consumers, the base models were dropped in 1972 and all models were designated as \\"SST\\". The SST offered more items standard than the previous year's base model at about the same price. Hornets now came with comfort and convenience items that most consumers expected, and these items were typically standard on imported cars. For the first time, an AM/FM monaural radio was added to the options list. Other changes included dropping the SC/360 compact muscle car, but the two-barrel version of the remained optional in addition to the V8 engine. For those desiring more performance, a four-barrel carburetor was a dealer-installed option on the 360 V8. Automatic transmissions were now the TorqueFlites sourced from Chrysler, and AMC called it the \\"Torque-Command\\". New for 1972 was the \\"X\\" package that attempted to replicate the success AMC had had with this trim option on the 1971 Gremlin. The Hornet X trim package was available on the two-door sedan and the new Sportabout. It could be ordered with any of the available I6 and V8 engines and included rally stripes, \\"X\\" emblems, a three-spoke sports steering wheel, and 14 x 6-inch slot-style steel road wheels with C78 x 14 Polyglas blackwall tires. A performance-oriented \\"Rallye\\" package was also introduced. It included among other items: special lower body stripes, full-synchromesh three-speed manual gearbox with floor shift, bucket seats, handling package, front disc brakes, 20.1 quick-ratio manual steering, and a sports steering wheel. It was possible to order both the Rallye and the X-package. Motor Trend magazine tested a V8 Hornet in 1972, measuring performance from 0 to 60 mph in 9 seconds flat and the 1/4-mile dragstrip in 16.8 seconds at . These were virtually equal to the V8 Chevrolet Nova that was tested in the same issue. : 1972 production: :: 2-door SST: 27,122 :: 4-door SST: 24,254 :: Wagon SST: 34,065 (Gucci version: 2,583)  Gucci Sportabout  The 1972 Hornet was notable for being one of the first American cars to offer a special luxury trim package created by a fashion designer. Named for Italian fashion designer Dr. Aldo Gucci, the Gucci package was offered only on the Sportabout, the four-door wagon with a single sloping hatch replacing the then traditional window/tailgate door. The option included special beige-colored upholstery fabrics on thickly padded seats and inside door panels (with red and green striping) along with Gucci logo emblems and a choice of four exterior colors: Snow White; Hunter Green; Grasshopper Green, and Yuca Tan. The Gucci model proved to be a success, with 2,583 produced in 1972 (and 2,252 more for 1973) Sportabouts so equipped. AMC also produced a one-off Sportabout for Gucci's personal use. The car was powered by a 5-litre V8 engine and had a three-speed automatic transmission. The interior featured leather was door panels, cargo area as well as the front and rear center armrests. The doors and custom-designed bucket seats received red and green striped inserts. The instrument panel was given a centrally located, pull-out writing desk, graced with a scribbler and a sterling silver bamboo pen. A map light at the end of a flexible arm extended from the right side of the desk, the left carried a vanity mirror, also on a flex stem. The back of the front seats popped open. The one on the passenger's side served as a snack table or provided a flat surface for playing games. The compartment behind the driver concealed a miniature liquor cabinet, complete with four sterling silver tumbles and two decanters‚Äîall decorated with red and green enamel stripes. American Motors followed this designer influence in successive years with the Cardin Javelin in 1973 and the Cassini Matador in 1974, but there were no new signature designer versions after those. This trim package concept inspired other automakers ‚Äì including Ford's luxury marque, Lincoln in 1976 ‚Äì to offer packages styled by other famous fashion designers.  Green Hornet  In 1972 the Canadian AMC plant produced a Canada-only 2-door Hornet marketed as the \\"Green Hornet.\\" In addition to being green, the model was built with a \\"Baja\\" grain vinyl top and came standard with sport-styled wheel covers and whitewall tires. The engine was the I6 with three-speed Torque- Command automatic transmission. Options included bucket seats, side stripes, and engines including AMC's V8. = 1973 = AMC's Mini-Camper accessory The biggest visible changes among all AMC automobiles for the 1973 model year were to the Hornet line and its new model, a two-door hatchback. Car and Driver magazine called it \\"the styling coup of 1973\\". Other changes included a new front-end design and bodywork with a V-shaped grille, a slightly recessed and longer hood, and longer peaked front fenders. The facelift incorporated a new stronger and larger energy-absorbing recoverable front bumper system with a horizontal rubber strip that met the new no-damage at NHTSA safety legislation. The rear also received a new bumper with twin vertical rubber guards, but the 5 mph unit (matching the front) was optional. The overall length of the Hornet increased . For the 1973 model year, the SST designation was dropped from the Hornet line, and all were simply called Hornet. The newly introduced two-door hatchback incorporated a fold-down rear seat for increased cargo volume from . An optional hinged floor made a hidden storage space that housed a temporary use \\"space-saver\\" spare tire, and created a flat load area totaling . The new hatchback was available with a Levi's bucket seat interior trim option that was actually made of spun nylon fabric, rather than real cotton denim, to comply with flammability standards as well as offer greater wear and stain resistance. The interior included copper Levi's rivets, traditional contrasting stitching, and the Levi's tab on both the front seatbacks, as well as unique door panels with Levis trim with removable map pockets and \\"Levi's\\" decals on the front fenders. An optional dealer accessory was available to convert the open hatchback area into a recreational vehicle or camper with mosquito net windows. The Mini-Camper Kit converted an open hatchback into a camping compartment and enough room for sleeping with the rear seat folded down. The ‚ÄúMini-Camper‚Äù was a weatherproof covering that fitted over the roof section from the B-pillar back to the rear bumper that was easy to set up. The two- and four-door sedan models were carried over while the Sportabout wagon received a new optional upscale \\"D/L\\" package. This trim package included exterior woodgrain bodyside decal panels, a roof rack with a rear air deflector, and individual reclining seats upholstered in plush cloth. The Gucci edition wagon was continued for one more year with five exterior color choices. The \\"X\\" package was now available only for the Sportabout and hatchback. It included color-coordinated \\"rally\\" side stripes, 14 x 6-inch slot-style steel wheels with C78 x 14 Goodyear Polyglas tires, an \\"X\\" emblem, and a sports steering wheel. Engines incorporated new emissions controls and the choices on all Hornet models included two I6s, the standard or a version, as well as two V8s, the base or the . Any Hornet model could be ordered with the two-barrel 360 engine and automatic transmission. Demand for classic muscle car cars had disappeared by 1973, but the Hornet was a relatively light car and was a \\"mildly spirited performer\\" in stock form with the new emissions gear. A Hornet hatchback with the 360 V8 was tested by Car and Driver. The 0-60 time was 8.4 seconds with a 3.15 rear axle ratio and the magazine noted that the Hornet hatchback was \\"...so good that AMC is sure to finally lose its underdog status.\\" Research sponsored by the U.S. National Highway Traffic Safety Administration (NHTSA) to improve front and side crashworthiness was first applied into production compact vehicles starting with the 1973 Hornet, which included stronger doors designed to withstand penetration in the first of crush. Spurred by AMC's success in its strategy of improving product quality, and an advertising campaign focusing on \\"we back them better because we build them better\\", the automaker achieved record profits. American Motors' comprehensive \\"Buyer Protection Plan\\" warranty was expanded for the 1973 models to cover lodging expenses should a car require overnight repairs when the owner is away from home.Lamm, p. 202. Suggested prices began at $2,298 for the base model two-door sedan with the more popular new hatchback going for $2,449. : 1973 production: :: 2-door: 23,187 :: 4-door: 25,452 :: Wagon: 44,719 (Gucci version: 2,251) :: Hatchback: 40,110 = 1974 = 1974 AMC Hornet base model AMC Hornet station wagon All four versions of the Hornet were mostly carryovers in 1974, with minimal trim changes. The front bumper lost its full-width vinyl rub strip but gained two rubber-faced bumper guards. A larger, energy-absorbing rear bumper was added to meet new 5 mph safety standards, and the license plate was moved up to a position between the taillights. All Hornet body styles saw sales gains compared to the previous year. New inertial-reel seat/shoulder belts were standard, along with a new electronic system requiring front-seat passengers to buckle up before the engine would start. : 1974 production: :: 2-door: 29,950 :: 4-door: 29,754 :: Wagon: 71,413 :: Hatchback: 55,158 = 1975 = 1975 Hornet Focusing on the new Pacer, AMC kept the Hornet mostly the same.

In a return to its philosophy of economical compact cars, AMC emphasized its comprehensive \\"Buyer Protection Plan\\" warranty in marketing the Hornets. Six-cylinder Hornets could be ordered with a new British supplied Laycock de Normanville \\"J-type\\" overdrive. Optional on cars with a manual three-speed transmission, the unit was controlled by a pushbutton at the end of the turn signal stalk. The overdrive unit engages automatically at speeds above and drops out at . It also included an accelerator pedal kickdown switch for faster passing. All U.S. market Hornets featured catalytic converters and now required gasoline without tetraethyl lead. \\"Unleaded Fuel Only\\" warnings were displayed on both the fuel gauge and on a decal by the fuel filler. Consumers complained loudly about the 1974 \\"mandatory seat belt\\" system, and it was replaced in 1975 with a simple reminder buzzer and light. The U.S. economy was experiencing inflation, and new car sales fell for all the automakers. The industry sold 8.2 million units, a drop of more than 2.5 million from the record pace in 1973. Sales of the Hornet also suffered. : 1975 production: :: 2-door: 12,392 :: 4-door: 20,565 :: Wagon: 39,593 :: Hatchback: 13,441 = 1976 = In its sixth year as a carryover, AMC priced the sedan and hatchback at the same identically, with the Sportabout slightly higher. That year, the Dodge Aspen and Plymouth Volare were introduced; the line included a station wagon, ending AMC's monopoly on 6-cylinder domestic compact wagons. : 1976 production: :: Total: 71,577 = 1977 = The Hornet line was mostly unchanged for 1977 with improvements made to engines and transmissions for increased fuel efficiency and the effects of new nitrogen oxides (NOx) emission standards. All 3-speed manual transmissions were now on the floor. A new \\"AMX\\" model also appeared. : 1977 production: :: 2-door: 6,076 :: 4-door: 31,331 :: Wagon: 28,891 :: Hatchback: 11,545 In fall 1977, the Hornet was re-engineered and restyled to become the 1978 Concord and helped establish the \\"luxury compact\\" market segment. With its upgraded design, components, and more standard features, the new Concord was moved upscale from the economy-focused Hornet. Changes to the AMC's \\"junior\\" platform made the new Concord more comfortable and desirable to buyers seeking an image of luxury, as well as greater value.  AMX  A new sports-oriented model, the AMX, was introduced to appeal to young, performance-oriented car buyers. The AMX was available only as a hatchback with the six or the V8 engine (automatic only) featuring a floor-shifted four- speed manual or automatic transmission. Standard was an upgraded black or tan interior with a floor console, \\"rally\\" instrumentation with tachometer, and \\"soft-feel\\" sports steering wheel. The special \\"Hornet AMX\\" was only available in four exterior colors that included matching painted bumpers with a wraparound rubber guard strip, bodyside rubber guard strip, and contrasting AMX model identification bodyside decals ahead of the rear wheels. The exterior included a front spoiler integrated into the front lower fender extensions, rear lower fender flares, sport-styled road wheels, brushed aluminum \\"Targa top\\" band over the B-pillars and roof, black left and right outside mirrors, and louvers for the rear hatch window. Options included bright aluminum road wheels and large Hornet-graphic decals on the hood and on the decklid. This model marked the return of a famous name that evoked AMC's original AMX two-seat sports car.  International markets  The AMC Hornet was exported to international markets, as well as assembled under license from Complete knock down (CKD) kits that were shipped from AMC's U.S. or Canadian plants. The foreign-built cars incorporated numerous components and parts that were produced by local manufacturers to gain tax or tariff preferences. = Australia = Rambler Hornet built by Australian Motor Industries Between 1970 and 1975, a total of 1,825 Hornets were built in right-hand-drive at the Australian Motor Industries (AMI) factory at Port Melbourne in Victoria, Australia. The initial engineering to right hand drive and interior design was achieved firstly with South African-built Hornets and then used as the blueprint for Australian assembly. The Hornet was sold in Australia as the \\"Rambler Hornet\\", only in four-door sedan body style. It was fitted with either a or six-cylinder engine and with an automatic transmission. Australian Hornets were always a model behind the U.S models, i.e the 1972 Australian model was really a U.S 1971 model, etc. AMI never received the U.S 1973 model and therefore no Hornets were assembled in 1974. AMI assembled the U.S 1972 model again in 1975 using whatever 1973 parts had arrived in the interim that could be fitted to a 1972 model. While the Hornet was the least expensive compact model in the United States, the Hornet in Australia was a luxury model, with high levels of trim, carpet, tires, and accessories. These included high-back seats, fully lined boot and covered spare wheel. The Hornet used a PBR fully assisted dual braking system, and front disc brakes from the Javelin Trans Am. The Hornet sold for $3,999 in 1970, with 407 cars being sold in Australia in that year. Sales peaked in 1971 with 597 sold. Sales dropped to 355 in 1972 and to 212 in 1973. 1974 saw 118 sales (of cars assembled in 1973.) 1975 was the Hornet's final year in Australia, with 136 sales. = Costa Rica = Purdy Motor, which had been established in 1959 to import Toyota and AMC vehicles into Costa Rica built an assembly plant in San Jose in 1965 to assemble Toyota and AMC vehicles for the local market. They would go on to assemble the Rambler American, Classic, Ambassador, Rebel, and Javelin during this time. Assembly of the Hornet began in 1970 and was marketed as the \\"Rambler SST.\\" In 1974 a new local vehicle manufacturer, Motorizada de Costa Rica, purchased the rights of Rambler distributorship from Purdy Motors. Motorizada continued to assemble AMC and Jeep vehicles as well as other brands. New for Costa Rica in 1974 was the AMC Hornet Sportabout sold locally as the AMC ‚ÄúUnisex.‚Äù Motorizada was liquidated in 1979 allegedly for not paying taxes thereby ending the AMC brand in Costa Rica. = Mexico = 1977 four-door sedan, regular use in Chile (2011) American Motors has partial ownership of Veh√≠culos Automotores Mexicanos (VAM) and produced Hornets in Mexico from 1970 through 1977. The VAM built cars continued to be called VAM Rambler following the tradition of the VAM-built Rambler American models up to 1974. The Mexican models included: * VAM Rambler American (up to 1974) U.S. equivalent: AMC Hornet * VAM Rambler American Rally ‚Äì U.S. equivalent: AMC Hornet X sedan instead of hatchback * VAM American (after 1975) U.S. equivalent: AMC Hornet base model * VAM American Rally ‚Äì U.S. equivalent: AMC Hornet X sedan instead of hatchback * VAM American ECD (1975‚Äì1977) U.S. equivalent ‚Äì AMC Hornet DL two- and four-door sedans * VAM American GFS (1977) U.S. equivalent: AMC Hornet DL two-door sedan, replaces two-door ECD * VAM Camioneta American autom√°tica (1977) U.S. equivalent: AMC Hornet DL wagon with automatic transmission The VAM cars came with different trims and interiors than the equivalent AMC-made models. The models also combined different front clips, such as the 1977 VAM American came with the shorter U.S. and Canadian market 1977 Gremlin front end, while its interior trim featured premium seats and upholstery.Wilson, 1977 VAM American Rally brochure cover. The engines in VAM models were based on AMC designs, but modified and built by VAM. Unique to Mexico included the and I6 engines. These were designed to cope with the high altitudes encountered in Mexico. VAM Rambler American The initial VAM Rambler Americans were available in a single nameless trim level (equivalent to the U.S. SST models), with only an optional performance-minded \\"Rally\\" package for the two-door sedans that was carried over from 1969. The model was not available with the 199 cu in inline six-cylinder or the 304 and 360 cu in V8s. Editions like the performance-oriented Hornet SC/360 and Hornet AMX plus the special package versions Levis and Gucci Hornet Sportabout were also not produced. The hatchback was also missing as the line already had three body styles in production, which was the top allowed by legislation at the time. For this reason, all VAM sporty versions of the Hornet were made using the two-door sedan as the base, like its 1971‚Äì1972 AMC counterparts. Unlike the Hornet, the now fourth-generation VAM Rambler American kept the same economy focus of its predecessor models despite its long list of standard equipment. =1970= The Hornet-based 1970 VAM Rambler American was restricted to a sedan in two- or four-door versions as under AMC, both featured a standard a I6 producing with a 244 degree camshaft, 8.5:1 compression ratio, and a single-barrel Carter RBS or YF carburetor. A fully synchronized three-speed manual transmission with column-mounted shifter, heavy-duty clutch, and a 3.54:1 rear differential gear ratio were standard. The cars came with regular suspension, four-wheel drum brakes, manual steering, four-rigid-bladed engine fan, and regular-duty cooling system. Standard convenience equipment included a two-tone padded dashboard with a three-pod instrument cluster, electric windshield wipers and washers, a 200 km/h speedometer, side marker lights, four-way hazard lights, antitheft steering column locking mechanism, base steering wheel, brake system warning light, AM radio with a single in-dash speaker, front ashtray, cigarette lighter, locking glove box with \\"RAMBLER\\" emblem on the door, padded sunvisors, day/night rearview mirror, cardboard- type sound-absorbing and heat-isolating headliner, round dome light, dual coat hooks, flip-open rear side vents, full carpeting, driver's side rubber floor mat sewed to the carpet, front bench seat with split folding backs on two-door sedan or with a fixed back on the four-door, bench rear seat, two-point front seatbelts, dual rear ashtrays, front and rear side armrests, vinyl-cloth upholstery on seats and side door panels, aluminum grille, backup lights, steel wheels with center hubcaps, dual \\"232 SIX\\" rear quarter panel emblems, dual \\"bulleye\\" emblems on the lower corner of the rear side vents, script \\"American\\" emblems on both front fenders, capital-lettered \\"RAMBLER\\" rectangular emblem between the right taillight and the gas filler, non-locking gas cap, manual driver's side remote mirror, and radio antenna. Factory options consisted of a heating system with windshield defroster, power drum brakes, power steering, bright molding package, protective side moldings, parcel shelf, courtesy lights (separate or in-shelf), luxury wheel covers, sports steering wheel, custom steering wheel, passenger's side remote mirror, remote-controlled driver's side remote mirror, bright panel between taillights, and metal bumper guards with rubber edges. Dealership options included a universal 6000 RPM VDO tachometer with dual hands, full vinyl roof with additional bright moldings, heavy-duty suspension (front sway bar and stiffer adjustable shock absorbers), floor-mounted shifter for the three-speed transmission, front disk brakes, locking gas cap, license plate frames, mud flaps, trunk cover luggage rack, universal air conditioning system, among others. =1971= The VAM Rambler American sedans for 1971 were carried over from 1970. Among the changes was the incorporation of VAM's 266-degree camshaft to the 232 engine replacing AMC's 244-degree unit. Despite power increase, the official announced output of the engine was still at 4,400 rpm. New interior colors, side armrest, and door panel designs were available. The AM radio was updated to a newer model. The new year introduced the Hornet Sportabout-based Camioneta Rambler American. The station wagon version included the same equipment as the two sedan models with several additional features. The Camioneta Rambler American included the parcel shelf with courtesy lights as standard equipment and was the only Mexican Hornet version to be available with a three-speed automatic transmission as optional equipment. Wagons with the automatic transmission included the one-barrel 145 hp 232 six, while those with manual transmission had the 232 six with Carter WCD carburetor. =1972= The 1972 model year VAM models incorporated the same engineering revisions and upgrades of the U.S. market AMC-built counterparts. Engines were the same as the year before with a one-barrel 145 hp 232 as standard on the sedans and automatic wagon and the two-barrel 155 hp version for the manual wagon. All featured a front sway bar as standard equipment. The 1972 models also included a new plastic grille with a revised hood latch, along with a new taillight design with larger backup lights, a new optional wheel cover design, a third AM radio model (shared with the VAM Javelin), and new interior door panels with a wood imitation rectangular portion. This was also the first year of the seatbelt warning buzzer located above the light and wiper knobs. The Camioneta Rambler American featured the Chrysler-built TorqueFlite A904 automatic transmission, replacing the previous Borg-Warner \\"Shift-Command\\" units. =1973= The 1973 model year VAM Hornets were redesigned and incorporated a new front end design with larger horizontal rectangular side marker lights, semi-square headlight bezels, and a \\"V\\"-shaped grille and hood edge. The front bumper included AMC's five-mile- per-hour design, but without the recovering shocks; in their place were regular rigid bumper mounts as in previous years. The automobile product standards in Mexico were less restrictive than in the U.S.; thus, VAMs mounted the bumpers placed closer to the body than their AMC counterparts. The 232 engine was replaced by the AMC I6 rated at gross with Carter RBS/YF one-barrel carburetor, 266 degree camshaft, and an 8.5:1 compression ratio. The three- speed automatic transmission for the first time became available in the sedan models as an option and the rear differential gear ratio changed to 3.31:1 in all units. Other features included new door panels, longer narrower inside door latches, controls for the cigarette lighter, wiper/washer, and lights knobs had rubber knobs, modified taillight lenses, the deletion of the rectangular \\"RAMBLER\\" emblem in favor of \\"American\\" script on the rear panel, \\"258\\" emblems replacing the \\"232 SIX\\" rectangular ones and the removal of the bullseye emblems on the C-pillar base. =1974= The 1974 Rambler American was a carryover. The only difference was the presence of the rear five-mile-per-hour bumper and the rear license plate was relocated to the center of the rear panel over the gas filler. The standard wheels for the year were VAM's new 14x6-inch five-spoke design with volcano hubcaps. The I6 included an evaporative canister to reduce emissions, and a slightly lower 8.3:1 compression ratio. However, during the mid-year, the compression ratio was lowered even more to 7.6:1. In both cases, the engines were still advertised as having an output of 170 hp. The seat and door panel designs were revised. The parking brake pedal received a new smaller rubber pad. VAM American The introduction of the Gremlin line by VAM in 1974, which became the company's smallest and most affordable model, created a gap between the lower end Rambler American line and the larger, top Classic (Matador) line; the situation was also applicable to the performance Javelin line despite being discontinued in 1973. The difference in size and engine series between the Rambler American and the Gremlin was not enough for VAM to create the impression of a more solid and more importantly a diverse product line since both cars were perceived as belonging to the same economy level, which would also mean the creation of internal competition. The VAM Rambler American was restricted to the economy segment since its introduction to the Mexican market, the only exceptions to this being the luxury limited edition Rambler American Hardtop (Rambler American 440H in the US) for 1963 and 1965, as well as the sporty Rambler American Rally (Rambler American Rogue and Hornet Rallye X/Hornet X in the US) from 1969 through 1974. The model was shifted from the economy to the mid-segment, as an all-new generation introduced for 1975. This didn't just readjust the company's full product line, but was also an opportunity to rejuvenate the compact line itself. By this time, the Hornet- based Rambler American had been on the market for five years and saw continued sales and positive image. The name was simplified from Rambler American to just American, marking the discontinuation of the Rambler brand in Mexico. The greatest change was the creation of the new luxury American ECD trim level followed by a revised and improved American Rally and American base models, which helped to distance the line further from the Gremlin. The cars in all versions obtained substantial updates and upgrades. =1975= The American base model in its first year was characterized by incorporating all- new rectangular amber parking lights, grille divided into six squared portions, and more hexagonal-lined headlight bezels. Manual front disk brakes were standard and the I6 engine featured Prestolite electronic ignition. This engine was carried over with a 7.6:1 compression ratio, 266 degree camshaft, , and a single-barrel Carter YF or RBS carburetor. Interiors included new door panels available in either a solid color or two-tone alongside new seat patterns. The two-tone dashboard was replaced by a color-keyed unit with a new \\"American\\" emblem on the glove box door and a standard fuel economy gauge. Cars equipped with automatic transmission included a heater and power steering at no extra cost. =1976= The 1976 models were almost the same as their immediate predecessors; their differences were limited to a compression ratio increase for the I6 from 7.6:1 to 8.0:1. New gauges appeared in the form of a 160 km/h speedometer and revised warning lights, sun visors were redesigned to larger more rectangular units with side bending portions, a new more-ornate dome light lens, new seat and door panel designs, while a rear defroster was added to the options. The separate seatbelts warning buzzer between the wipers and lights knobs was discontinued. New full-rubber bumper guards became available alongside the already existing metal ones with rubber strips. =1977= The 1977 models had numerous changes. Most noticeable was a new front end that AMC intended to make exclusive for the Gremlin line, consisting of independent squared headlight bezels with rounded corners and an egg-crate smile-shaped grille carrying over the rectangular parking lights of the previous two years and a new front bumper. A second \\"American\\" emblem was applied over the front edge of the hood on the right corner. The two-point seatbelts were replaced by fixed three-point units on both sedan models. Wagons included three-point retractable units as factory issue. The Carter RBS carburetor was discontinued leaving only the YF model on the I6. Two-door sedans with the manual transmissions now featured a floor-mounted gearshift with low-back fold-down individual seats, while models with automatic transmissions retained the bench seat with split-folding backs and a column- mounted shifter. This also meant manual units incorporated a safety lock lever in their steering column ignition switch shared with the American Rally model. The seats and door panels were slightly modified from the last year. A new \\"American\\" emblem with different typography was applied to the glove box door. The \\"258\\" rear quarter panel emblems were replaced by new \\"4.2\\" units. Rambler American Rally The sporty Rambler American Rally package was originally introduced in 1969 for the third-generation Rambler American two- door sedan as a more economical sporty alternative to the muscular VAM Javelin and personal luxury VAM Rambler Classic SST (Rebel SST hardtop). With the arrival of the new Hornet-based models for 1970, the package was continued and improved, containing not just more regular production accessories but also all-new exclusive ones. The Rambler American Rally model was available a full year ahead of AMC's Hornet SC/360 and two years ahead of the Hornet X and Hornet Rallye-X models, making it the first-ever performance product based on the Hornet. The package started with an exclusive engine version, the high- performance 9.8:1 compression ratio I6 with Carter WCD carburetor and 266 degree camshaft designed by VAM's own engineering department. Other features included a black two-spoke sports steering wheel with a central bullseye emblem, wide reclining individual front seats, floor-mounted Hurst Performance shifter 150-T three-speed manual transmission with a locking mechanism connected to the steering wheel ignition switch, full bright molding package including rear panel overlay between the taillights and two courtesy lights. Unlike the 1969 version, power drum brakes were no longer included, but available as optional equipment. The Rambler American Rally for 1971 was almost equal to the previous year's counterpart. Changes and novelties were limited to the script \\"American\\" fender emblems being replaced by new script \\"Rally\\" units, which are the only way to tell differentiate 1971 from 1970 models from the outside. The front seat controls were revised with a new knob placed to the outer side of each seatback, new \\"mushroom\\"-shaped armrests with a central horizontal bright molding, new side panels with simulated stitches, and a steering wheel design similar to the previous one but incorporating three false spokes per arm instead of the smooth soft surface. A new AM monaural radio model replaced the previous unit dated back to 1966 Rambler American and Classic models. The success of the Rally package made VAM ascend it to a trim level for 1972 and with that several improvements followed. The safety mechanism connecting the shifter to the ignition switch was discontinued, which meant the incorporation of a small safety lever on the side of the column to keep the ignition switch from accidentally turning into lock position with the vehicle in motion. The previously optional 8000 RPM tachometer became standard equipment along with AMC's new three-arm three- spoke sports steering wheel with a central cylindrical button. Low-back, smaller more bucket-like front reclining seats replaced the wide units of the previous two years, which meant a free space between both units over the transmission tunnel. The round floor shift base shared with 1968‚Äì1969 Javelins departed in favor of a new squared design. The bright rear panel got an aluminum turned appearance and the taillight lenses featured a new larger backup light and side stripes. The grille was changed from aluminum to plastic and an updated hood latch appeared. Mechanically, the front sway bar was passed on to the standard equipment list, but the biggest change of the year was present under the hood. The 1972 Rally engine was the VAM I6 producing at 4,600 rpm, 9.5:1 compression ratio, with a high-flow Carter RBS-PV1 single- barrel carburetor and the 266 degree camshaft, which was originally used in 1969‚Äì1970 VAM Javelins. The \\"232 SIX\\" emblems were replaced in favor of new \\"252\\" units. For 1973, VAM sought to standardize and consolidate as many parts and components to cut costs. The company discontinued both the 232 and 252 engine series in favor of the new 170 gross HP, 8.5:1 compression ratio AMC I6 with VAM's inhouse 266-degree camshaft and single-barrel Carter RBS or YF carburetor, which became the powerhouse of the Rambler American Rally of the year. This new engine shared the same crankshaft as VAM's also new I6 introduced two years before in the VAM Javelin model, allowing VAM to optimize resources and reduce costs. With the engine came a change in the rear differential gear ratio from 3.54:1 to 3.31:1. Aside from the revised taillights, the first set of high-back bucket seats became present, which were shared with the second-generation VAM Javelin. Strangely, unlike all previous models, they were not available with a reclining mechanism. New side panel designs accompanied a now standard parcel shelf incorporating both courtesy lights. The front end was completely updated as in the standard Rambler American models except for the unique characteristic of the blackout grille. The engine displacement emblems got their last digit changed into number eight keeping the same design as last year's units. The rectangular \\"Rambler\\" rear emblem was removed and its place taken by the manuscript \\"Rally\\" unit that was no longer present on the front fenders. The 1974 Rallys were mostly unchanged from the 1973s. Just like on the Rambler American, their largest difference was the new rear five-mile-per-hour bumper and relocated rear license plate. These models incorporated the first set of VAM's original five-spoke wheels, which carried full volcano-shaped hubcaps and trim rings. Due to this, wheel covers were removed as available accessories for this model. For the first time, a set of factory side stripes decorated the exterior of the model including a stylish manuscript \\"Rally\\" emblem over the rear quarter panel, creating a two-tone appearance. Front seats were mostly the same as the year before, now shared with the brand-new Classic AMX (Matador X) model. The discontinuation of the original VAM logo during 1973 in favor of the new arrow-type one meant its removal from the dial of the tachometer. The shifter was changed into a T-shaped Hurst unit. A new AMC logo over a black background replaced the American Motors legend over the transparent acrylic cap in the steering wheel's horn button. The 258 six engines received a drop in compression ratio from 8.5:1 to 8.3:1. American Rally The new marketing concept for VAM's compact model was also included for its sporty version. This started with the change in name from Rambler American Rally to American Rally. For the first time, VAM sought to move model the higher from the economical sporty model status it pioneered. This meant a higher focus not just on sportiness but also on luxury. The 1975 American Rally alongside its new name obtained its first redesign of identity emblems in the form of an all-new \\"RALLY\\" nameplate in printing letters connected by a background line. Like the former one, it was located on the rear panel between the right taillight and rear license plate. A new grille, headlight bezels, and parking lights shared with the American and Gremlin lines were now in blackout form. New side decals were discreet lines running the full length of the car without changing proportions and incorporating Rally emblems on the front fenders. The interior for the first time was different from that of the American model other than the front seats. Rally emblems appeared etched on the front high corners of the side panels. All previously exposed metal parts like the top of the doors, rear sides, and B pillar were now upholstered in vinyl. The \\"RAMBLER\\" emblem on the glove box was replaced by a \\"RALLY\\" one of the same design. Unlike all of its predecessors, a considerable amount of 1975 American Rally units were equipped with the heater as standard. The aspect that made the American Rally the most different from the last generation was the mechanicals. The 258 six-cylinder obtained an all-new electronic ignition system sourced by Prestolite. Manual front disk brakes replaced the previous drums. A new TREMEC 170-F four-speed manual transmission with Hurst linkage came from the factory, although VAM was not able to fully standardize it and several Hurst-linked three-speed 1975 American Rally versions were built. Unfortunately, the model was not free from shortcomings. Since 1973, the growing problem of air pollution (especially in Mexico City) forced the Mexican government to schedule the beginning of emission certification to all engines produced in the country, which would take effect in 1974. This would affect all high compression engines of all marques. For this reason, the I6 had dropped from 8.5:1 to 8.3:1 compression ratio in the change between 1973 and 1974. However, this change was not enough to comply with the government standards and VAM was forced to decrease compression even more in mid-1974. This meant a final 7.6:1 compression ratio for the I6 for the second half of the year production of the 1974 Rambler American Rally. For this reason, the aforementioned model along with the 1975 American Rally became the lowest- performing examples of VAM's original compact sporty model, ending even below the stock 155 hp I6 of the 1969 Rambler American Rally and the stock 232 1970‚Äì1972 Rambler American two-door sedans. The improvements in the form of the four-speed transmission and electronic ignition were insufficient to overcome the problem. For 1976, VAM introduced the Gremlin X for the first time in Mexico, retaking the economical sporty concept originally held by the Rally model. The company's engineers started to find solutions to the problem of lack of power without rising gas emission, and the I6 obtained a higher 8.0:1 compression ratio this year. Due to this improvement along with the subcompact's lighter body and shorter exhaust, the 1976 Gremlin X outperformed the low-compression 1975 American Rally, despite that it was not offered with the new four-speed transmission. To avoid internal competition once again in both performance models as well as further pushing of the line's concept change, VAM proceeded to upgrade the American Rally to distance it from the new subcompact version. The 1976 models switched to the 7.7:1 compression ratio VAM I6 with Holley 2300 two-barrel carburetor and 266 degree camshaft, shared with the VAM Pacer and all Classic models. This marked for the first time the presence of VAM's largest engine in the Hornet-based compact line. The works on solving the shortage of power on the 258 six were still in process in the 282, thus the existing version was installed under the hood. The 1976 American Rally in the performance department fared much better with its higher displacement, large-diameter valves, larger intake manifold and larger carburetor, but was still falling short on compression ratio. The model outperformed all of its predecessors. However, there was an exception in the form of the 1972 Rambler American Rally with its 9.5:1 compression ratio 252 cu in six, which was still half a second faster despite its high-flow one- barrel carburetor, small intake manifold, three-speed transmission, the higher rear gear ratio, and lower displacement. Aside from the engine, the 1976 American Rally was accompanied by noticeable improvements consisting of power front disk brakes, power steering, and tinted windshield, all as standard equipment. The four-speed transmission and heater were fully standardized this year. New seat patterns and side panel designs (without the etched Rally emblem) were used, while gauges were changed to a 160 km/h speedometer and 6,000 RPM tachometer. New dome light lens design and longer sun visors were shared with the American and Gremlin. The new engine and standard equipment coupled with the mid-year discontinuation of the 1976 Classic AMX (Matador X) ascended the American Rally into the top of the line performance model of the company. The sportiness and concept were fairly close to that of the 1972‚Äì1976 VAM Javelins and aforementioned Classic AMXs. With the engine change, the rear quarter panel emblems morphed into \\"4.6\\" units. After only one year, the model name \\"Rally\\" emblem on the rear panel was once again redesigned. As the 1977 models arrived, the engineering upgrades seen on the 258 six the year before finally saw the light on the 282. All-new head design with Quench-type combustion chambers took compression ratio from 7.7:1 to 8.0:1. It was accompanied by a totally new aluminum intake manifold with improved flow keeping the Holley 2300 two-barrel carburetor. These improvements made the 1977 American Rally the best-performing model of its series, even surpassing the high compression 1972 model. Despite this, advertised horsepower and torque ratings were the same as the year before. The power increase allowed the use of a new 3.07:1 rear differential gear ratio for better economy and top speed without losing acceleration and towing capacity. The front high-back bucket seats obtained new patterns and for the first time since the 1972 reclining mechanism (as standard equipment), three-point front seatbelts with double retractable mechanisms were added, a new VAM-designed digital tachometer took the place of the conventional analog unit in the midyear. In the exterior, the largest novelty of the year was the application of the new Gremlin front clip. New decals covering only the front fenders in their top sides started near the doors all the way to the marker lights, between the lights and stripe was a \\"Rally 4.6\\" sticker. Like the three luxury versions of the line for the year, the 1977 American Rally was the first unit of its series to offer the original factory air conditioning system as an option. The hood and trunk lights as well as the glove box unit were added to the standard equipment list. The Rally included D70x14 radial tires in all years and rear gear ratios of 3.54:1 (1970‚Äì1972), 3.31:1 (1973‚Äì1976), and 3.07:1 (1977). The American Rally was discontinued in 1977 along with all other Hornet-based VAM Americans. It would find a successor in the 1978 American Rally AMX model (VAM's version of the 1978 AMC Concord AMX), meaning the production in Mexico for the first time of AMC's hatchback coupe body style. Unlike the AMC Hornet X models, both the Hornet-based Rambler American Rally and American Rally were never available with V8 engines, automatic transmissions, or column-mounted shifters. The Rally model was more than just an appearance package, but also not as strong as a muscle car finds its closest American equivalent in the form of the 1972 Hornet Rallye-X model. It is regarded as one of VAM's most collectible and sought-after models. American ECD As part of the shift in market strategy for VAM's Hornet-based compacts for 1975 that included advancements in the American base model and American Rally was the introduction of the new American ECD or Edici√≥n Cantos Dorados (Golden Edges Edition). It represented for the first time a VAM four-door compact was not an economy base model. The American ECD was VAM's first regular production luxury compact, before it was only the two-door hardtop 1963 and 1965 Rambler American Hardtop (Rambler American 440H in the US and Canada) limited editions. The ECD was restricted to the four-door sedan while the 1975 American Rally took the role of the high trim two-door sedan. The station wagon remained a single-edition model. The American ECD was equivalent in the US as the 1975 four-door Hornet DL model. The 1975 American ECD came standard with a 170 gross hp I6 engine with a single-barrel Carter carburetor, electronic ignition, 266-degree camshaft, and 7.6:1 compression ratio with regular cooling system. Included were manual front disk brakes with rear drums, power steering, heavy-duty suspension with front sway bar, Chrysler TorqueFlite A904 three-speed automatic transmission, and 3.31:1 rear gear ratio. The exterior of the model incorporated a full vinyl roof with bright moldings, regular bright molding package (wheel lip, rocker panels, drip rails, and between taillights molding), luxury wheel covers, \\"American\\" and \\"Autom√°tico\\" emblems on the rear panel, \\"258\\" emblems on rear quarter panels, and golden \\"ECD\\" emblems over the base of the C-pillars. Standard equipment also consisted of front and rear bench seats, front two-point seatbelts, front and rear armrests, luxury upholstery, custom steering wheel, column-mounted shifter, color-keyed padded dashboard, gasoline and water temperature gauges, warning lights (brakes, oil and electrical system), 200 km/h speedometer, vacuum gauge, front ashtray, cigarette lighter, heater with front defroster, AM monaural radio with a single speaker and antenna, locking glove box, parcel shelf, courtesy lights, padded sun visors, day/night rearview mirror, heat and sound insulating cardboard-type headliner, round dome light, dual coat hooks, rear ashtray mounted on the front seat back and driver's side remote mirror. Optional equipment included among others a passenger's side mirror, remote- controlled driver's side mirror, power brakes, bumper guards, tinted windshield, and light group. The 1976 American ECD included the same upgrades as the rest of the American line. These were longer sun visors, a 160 km/h speedometer, a new dome light lens, and a higher 8.0:1 compression ratio on the 258 six. A rear defroster was added to the options list while the tinted windshield became standard. The luxury seat patterns and wheel covers were redesigned. An electric analog clock appeared to the right of the speedometer, although several models kept the vacuum gauge. A new model for the year was the two-door American ECD. This model was a limited edition luxury American two-door sedan, comparable to the Rambler American Hardtop of the 1960s. The equipment was the same as the four-door American ECD with some differences. The engine on this model was the 200 gross hp I6 with a Holley 2300 two-barrel carburetor, 7.7:1 compression ratio, 266-degree camshaft, and electronic ignition. The automatic transmission was a floor-mounted shift design, a first in a VAM Hornet-based American. The front seats were upgraded to high-back individual non-reclining units instead of the four-door bench. The American ECD was once again restricted to the four-door sedan only for 1977. The model incorporated the new Gremlin front clip like the rest of the American line of the year. The \\"258\\" engine displacement emblems were replaced by new \\"4.2\\" units and the bumper guards were included free of extra charge. Power brakes were moved to the standard equipment list. Most of the light group was also installed as standard equipment; aside from the already existing courtesy lights came the hood light, trunk light, and glove box light. The electric clock was fully standardized in all units. Front seat belts were upgraded into three-point retractable units. The rear seatback got a concealed fold-down armrest. AMC's original factory air conditioning system for the first time became available as optional equipment. The Carter RBS one-barrel carburetor was discontinued leaving only the Carter YF model. American GFS and Camioneta Autom√°tica VAM executives and engineers sought to move the two- door 1976 American ECD from the limited edition status into a regular production model, and also change its concept from a general luxury into a personal luxury vehicle, which VAM no longer offered since the mid-1976 discontinuation of the Classic Brougham (Matador Brougham coupe) model. Taking advantage of this upcoming new model was a plan of this group of employees to make a homage to VAM's general manager Gabriel Fern√°ndez S√°yago, one of the most respected men in the Mexican auto industry at the time and leader of the company since 1946. The new personal luxury compact was named after him using his initials as a designation. The model was presented to him as a surprise in late 1976, which he appreciated highly but opting for a more humble stance, he requested the model not to carry his name. The group of VAM employees respected his decision, but managed an indirect way to keep their original plan. The general manager's initials were retained, but the meaning was changed into Grand Formula Sport. The model was introduced along with VAM's 1977 lineup as a two-door alternative to the American ECD and a luxury one to the sporty American Rally. The 1977 American GFS incorporated the same appearance and equipment novelties as the American ECD of the same year. Like the two-door 1976 American ECD, the model kept the individual front seat and floor-mounted automatic transmission configuration, with the notable difference of incorporating reclining mechanisms as standard equipment. From this model, the I6 was also retained, but incorporating the new head and intake manifold designs as well as the 3.07:1 rear gear ratio from the American Rally model of the year. The most unique aspect of the 1977 American GFS was its design of rear side windows and roof. VAM designers created a half Landau-type vinyl top carrying the roof Targa band AMC used for the 1977 Hornet AMX models and shortened flip-open rear side windows creating a thicker B-pillar. AMC really liked this styling touch and adopted it for its 1978‚Äì1979 Concord DL/Limited two-door models (except for the use of the Targa band). Also new for 1977 was VAM's first station wagon that was not an economy base model, the first in 17 years. This model was not a new trim level but a package included with the order of the automatic transmission. Like the American GFS, the engine changed from the 258 six to the and the 3.07:1 rear differential gear ratio. Like the American ECD, it shared the column-mounted gearshift and high-trim-upholstered bench seats (fold-down rear unit) and special side panels. Accessories shared with both luxury sedans included power brakes, power steering, heavy-duty suspension, bumper guards, full bright molding package, luxury wheel covers, \\"4.6\\" emblems (GFS only), tinted windshield, luxury steering wheel, electric analog clock, parcel shelf, full light group (except reading dome light) as well as all the general line novelties of the year. This created a luxury wagon for the first time in VAM's line up. The downside was that the economy base wagon would no longer be available with the option of an automatic transmission. VAM wagons with this package did not obtain a specific name since it was not a trim level, it was known within VAM and in printed materials as \\"Camioneta Autom√°tica\\" (automatic wagon). It would be until 1979 that it would officially obtain a designation, now based on the Concord-wagon, making \\"American DL\\" its full name. =South Africa= South Africa was the first international market that AMC invested in for right-hand drive production of the Hornet. The Rambler American was assembled in South Africa firstly by National Motor Assemblers Limited (NMA) in Durban and for 1968 at the Datsun assembly plant Rosslyn Motor Assemblers. In 1969 Rambler production was moved to the former GM plant, Motor Assemblies Limited (MA) in Durban which had come under the control of Toyota South Africa in 1964. MA assembled the American for its final year and the AMC Hornet 4-door sedan was assembled as its replacement in 1970. The initial design and engineering work to convert the car to right-hand drive for South Africa became the blueprint for the right-hand drive Hornets assembled in Australia. As with all AMC's export markets, the Hornet was marketed in South Africa as \\"Rambler.\\" The Hornet was advertised as being \\"built and marketed in South Africa by Toyota South Africa Ltd, wholly owned and controlled by South Africans ... sold and serviced country-wide by 220 Toyota dealers.\\" The Hornet was marketed through 1971. American Motors South Africa (Proprietary) Limited was the official license holder for production of the Rambler Hornet at the Motor Assemblies plant. However, latter production was hampered by problems arising from regulations. The nation's tariff structure considered only the weight of parts or materials made in South Africa would be calculated toward local content requirements. The objective was to increase indigenous production. As a result, the last of the South African-built Rambler Hornets had Chevrolet straight-6 engines. The objective was to standardize the manufacture of vehicle components within South Africa. In this case, a large component, the Hornet's original AMC engine was eliminated from the marketplace, while the switch also provided greater local production volume to the General Motors engine.Swart, p. 261. A total of 840 Hornets were built at the Motor Assemblies plant.http://motor-assemblies.blogspot.com/2012/01/motor- assemblies-limited.html?m=1#appendixb  Motorsports  AMC Hornets were campaigned in various motorsports events. Some technical and financial support was provided by the automaker in the early years. = Stock Car Racing = Bobby Allison was AMC's factory-backed NASCAR driver, racing #12 Matadors fielded by Roger Penske. Bobby also did a lot of short-track racing, often using a modified stock car he rebodied using Hornet sheet metal, painted red/white/blue in the AMC scheme, and numbered 12. = Drag racing = Hornets were campaigned on dragstrips from 1972 and became well known by their bold red, white, and blue graphics. Dave Street was an early Hornet racer in Northeast Pro Stock events. Drivers on the Pro Stock circuit included Wally Booth (backed by AMC until 1974), as well as Rich Maskin and Dave Kanners captured top awards. Booth drove a Hornet to the top qualifying spot at the 1975 NHRA U.S. Nationals. Some drivers converted from AMC Gremlins when tests with identical engines in 1973 showed that the hatchback Hornet had an advantage with higher speeds and lower times. The 1974 Gatornationals, as well as the 1976 NHRA U.S. Nationals and the World Finals were won by Wally Booth driving an AMC Hornet. The Hornets would do the quarter-mile in 8 seconds reaching . The last AMC Pro Stocker was campaigned through the 1982 season in American Hot Rod Association events. It was a Hornet AMX with nitrous injection. = Endurance = Champion spark plug ad with endurance record AMC Hornet In 1970, Lou Haratz drove an AMC Hornet over to set a new Trans- Americas record by going from Ushuaia, Argentina to Fairbanks, Alaska in 30 days and 45 minutes. He also went on to be the first to drive completely around the widest practical perimeter of the North, Central, and South American continents for a distance of in 143 days. The Hornet received a tune- up service in Caracas as well as in Lima, and the endurance record was promoted in various popular magazine advertisements for Champion spark plugs that were standard equipment in AMC engines. = IMSA racing = From 1971 the AMC Hornet was campaigned in the International Motor Sports Association (IMSA) races. Hornets ran in GTO class (Grand Touring type with engines of 2.5 L or more) and American Challenge (AC) class. American Motors provided only limited support in the form of technical help. The cars were gutted and powered by highly modified AMC 232 straight-six engines.Mitchell, pp. 110‚Äì113. In 1973, AMC cars very nearly placed 1-2-3, in a BF Goodrich Radial Challenge Series race, but Bob Hennig driving an AMC Hornet went out while in third place with only six laps to go. BMW driver Nick Craw and AMC Hornet driver Amos Johnson ended the IMSA series as co-champions in Class B. On 6 February 1977, out of 57 cars that started the 24 Hours of Daytona, Championship of Makes, at Daytona International Speedway, an AMC Hornet driven by Tom Waugh, John Rulon- Miller, and Bob Punch drove car #15 to 22nd place overall and 12th in the GTO class by completing 394 laps in . Amos Johnson drove car #7, an AC Class Hornet, in the 100 mile Road Atlanta race on 17 April 1977, as well as with co-driver Dennis Shaw to finish 11th in the Hallett Motor Racing Circuit on 24 July 1977. A 1977 Hornet AMX was prepared by \\"Team Highball\\" from North Carolina and driven by Amos Johnson and Dennis Shaw. Car #77 finished in 34th place in the GTO class out of the 68 that started the race by completing 475 laps, in the 17th Annual 24 Hours of Daytona Camel GT Challenge. The AMC cars \\"were killers at places like Daytona. Despite being about as aerodynamic as a brick they had those nice, big, reliable straight sixes ...\\" = SCCA Trans Am = Buzz Dyer drove a 1977 AMC Hornet AMX (car #77) with a V8 engine in the Sports Car Club of America (SCCA) Trans Am events at the Laguna Seca Raceway on 8 October 1978 and finished 46 laps. = Coast-to-coast run = Two Hot Rod staffers, John Fuchs and Clyde Baker, entered a 1972 AMC Hornet in the Cannonball Baker Sea-To-Shining-Sea Memorial Trophy Dash. This was an unofficial automobile race from New York City and Darien, CT, on the U.S. Atlantic coast, to Redondo Beach, a Los Angeles suburb on the Pacific coast during the time of the newly imposed speed limit set by the National Maximum Speed Law. The Hornet X hatchback was modified with a AMC V8 and auxiliary racing fuel cells to increase gasoline capacity. They finished in 13th place after driving for 41 hours and 15 minutes at an average speed of .Yates, p. 98.  James Bond movie  The 1974 Hornet X Hatchback featured in The Man with the Golden Gun on display at the National Motor Museum, Beaulieu As part of a significant product placement movie appearance by AMC, a 1974 Hornet X Hatchback is featured in the James Bond film: The Man with the Golden Gun, where Roger Moore made his second appearance as the British secret agent. The film's \\"most outrageous sequence\\" begins with Sheriff J.W. Pepper, who, on holiday in Thailand with his wife, is admiring a new, red AMC Hornet in a Bangkok showroom. He is about to test drive the car. The action begins as James Bond commandeers the Hornet from the dealership with Pepper in it for a car chase. The Hornet performs an \\"airborne pirouette as it makes a hold-your- breath jump across a broken bridge\\". The stunt car is significantly modified with a redesigned chassis to place the steering wheel in the center and a lower stance, as well as larger wheel wells compared to the stock Hornet used in all the other movie shots. The 360-degree mid-air twisting corkscrew was captured in just one filming sequence. Seven tests were performed in advance before the one jump performed by an uncredited British stuntman \\"Bumps\\" Williard for the film with six (or eight, depending on the source) cameras simultaneously rolling. Two frogmen were positioned in the water, as well as an emergency vehicle and a crane were ready, but not needed. The Cornell Aeronautical Laboratory (CAL) was used for computer modeling to calculate the stunt. The modeling called for a weight of car and driver, the exact angles and the distance between the ramps, as well as the launch speed. This stunt was adapted from Jay Milligan's Astro Spiral Javelin show cars. These were jumps performed in AMC sponsored thrill shows at fairs around the US, including the Houston Astrodome, where Gremlins and Hornets were also used to drive around in circles on their side two wheels in the arena. Using exactly the same ramp design, movie artists made the ramps convincingly look like a rickety old bridge that was falling apart. The movie's director ruined the continuous spiral effect of the stunt. By cutting camera shots as the car was in mid-air, it looks like trick photography to get the car upside-down instead of one continuous actual jump. Months of difficult work went into the scene that lasts only fifteen seconds in the movie. The Guinness World Records 2010 book describes this \\"revolutionary jump\\" as the \\"first astro spiral used in a movie\\" and lists it as third among the top ten James Bond film stunts. The actual Bond Hornet was preserved in the National Motor Museum in Beaulieu, UK together with other famous items owned by the Ian Fleming Foundation and used in the 007 films. In 2017, the car stunt car \\"in operable and in as-jumped condition\\" was auctioned by the museum. The AMC Hornet is one of Hagerty's favorites Bond cars for vintage automobile collectors on a budget. Several scale models of the AMC Hornet are available that include the James Bond hatchback versions made by Corgi Toys and Johnny Lightning.  Experimental Hornets  The AMC Hornet served as a vehicle for several experimental alternative power sources. = Gas turbine = In the aftermath of the Clean Air Act Amendments of 1970, research grants were funded by the government in further developing automotive gas turbine technology. This included conceptual design studies and vehicles for improved passenger-car gas-turbine systems that were conducted by Chrysler, General Motors (through its Detroit Diesel Allison Division), Ford in collaboration with AiResearch, and Williams Research teamed with American Motors.Linden, page 53. In 1971, a long-term test was conducted to evaluate actual road experience with a turbine powered passenger car. An AMC Hornet was converted to a WR-26 regenerative gas turbine power made by Williams International. A small-sized Williams gas turbine engine powered 1973 Hornet was used by New York City to evaluate comparable cost efficiency with piston engines and funded by a grant from the National Air Pollution Control Administration, a predecessor of the United States Environmental Protection Agency (EPA). The city was interested in \\"solving the air quality problems that New Yorkers were beginning to notice.\\" The Hornet's experimental power source was developed by inventor Sam B. Williams. Weighing in at and measuring by by , it produced at 4450 rpm with a clean exhaust. The engines performed well in theory and ran well, especially during tests on the Michigan International Speedway, but the cars needed more work to be adapted to the turbine engine for city driving and lacked the refinement of the purpose-built Chrysler Turbine Car. = Gasoline direct injection = Research to develop a Straticharge Continuous Fuel-Injection (SCFI) system (an early gasoline direct injection (GDI) design) was conducted with the backing of AMC. The Hornet's conventional spark ignited internal combustion straight-6-cylinder engine was a modified with a redesigned cylinder head, and road testing performed using a 1973 AMC Hornet. This SCFI system was a mechanical device that automatically responded to the engine's airflow and loading conditions with two separate fuel-control pressures supplied to two sets of continuous-flow injectors.Weiss, p. 2. It was \\"a dual-chamber, three- valve, fuel-injected, stratified-charge\\" engine.Weiss, p. 1. Flexibility was designed into the SCFI system for trimming it to a particular engine.Weiss, p. 25. = Hybrid = In 1976, the California Air Resources Board bought and converted AMC Hornets for its design research into hybrids. =Natural gas= The Consumers Gas Company (now Consumers Energy) operated a fleet of 1970 AMC Hornets converted dual-fuel system with compressed natural gas (CNG). This was an early demonstration project for clean and efficient vehicles. =Plug-in electric= In 1971, the Electric Fuel Propulsion Company began marketing the Electrosport, a plug-in electric vehicle (PEV) based on the Hornet Sportabout wagon.1971 Electrosport sales brochure, Electric Fuel Propulsion Company of Detroit, Michigan. It was designed to be a supplementary battery electric vehicle for commuting or daily chores, and to be recharged at home using household current or at \\"Charge Stations away from home to replenish power in 45 minutes, while you shop or have lunch.\\" =LaForce Ventur-E= The United States Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) conducted extensive tests of 1974 and 1975 AMC Hornets to evaluate the fuel economy claims made for the LaForce Ventur-E modifications. The LaForce prepared Hornet included a special carburetor that was designed to vary the fuel to air mixture under all operating conditions. Other modifications were made to the camshaft, a smaller combustion area, special \\"dual\\" exhaust manifolds, and the installation of solid valve lifters (in place of the standard hydraulic tappets. The manifold was designed to intercept gasoline between the carburetor and engine and \\"to use even the harder to burn heavy gasoline molecules\\" ‚Äì thus, claiming mileage increases of 40 to 57%. However, the EPA tests did not fully support the performance and economy claims that were to be achieved by these modifications in comparison to standard factory tuned vehicles. Concept cars The AMC Hornet platform served as the basis for evaluating design and styling ideas by AMC. In the late-2000s, the Hornet name was revived for a Dodge concept car. =Cowboy= AMC Cowboy concept pickup truck In the early 1970s, AMC was planning a compact coup√© utility (pickup) based on the Hornet to compete with the increasing sales of Japanese compact pickup models. A prototype called the Cowboy was developed under the leadership of Jim Alexander. The prototype vehicle featured a modified AMC Gremlin front design and a cargo box with a Jeep logo on the tailgate. The standard I6 engine would be more powerful than the 4-cylinders found in the imported pickups. The only surviving prototype was built using a 1971 Hornet SC360 with the 360 V8 and 4-speed manual transmission. It was used by AMC on their proving grounds for several years before being sold to an employee, who later installed a 1973 Hornet updated front end. However, with the increasing sales of the Hornet models, and the 1970 acquisition of Jeep and no 4WD option ready for the Cowboy (at the time all Jeeps were 4WD), AMC's product planners shelved the Cowboy truck program. A 4WD system was developed and later used on the 1980 AMC Eagle, and the \\"uniframe\\" construction (\\"frame\\" rails under the truck bed made of folded sheet metal and incorporated into the cab structure as one piece) resurfaced for the 1985 Jeep Comanche pickup, based on the unit body XJ Cherokee. =Hornet GT= In 1973, the Hornet GT toured auto shows as an asymmetrical styling exercise. The left (or driver's) side featured more glass area and a narrower \\"C\\" pillar for better visibility in comparison to the concept car's different design on its right side. Using different designs on each side is common practice within automobile styling studios, especially when money was tight; however, showing such an example to the public was unusual and AMC was not afraid to measure consumer reaction to new ideas. Other design elements and ideas presented on the Hornet GT show car included sealed glass to allowing hollow doors that could house easily accessible components while freeing up space in the dashboard area, as well as a stronger roof and support pillars for additional crash and rollover protection. = Hornet by Dodge = A mini-sized front-wheel-drive, concept car called Hornet was designed and developed by Dodge in 2006 for possible production in 2008 as the brand was entering European markets and attract younger customers. As the price of fuel increased, Chrysler continued work to launch the Hornet in 2010 in Europe, the United States and other markets. This Hornet project may have been cancelled as part of Fiat's partnership with Chrysler; but it was also rumored that the Hornet nameplate would instead be applied to a small Dodge sedan slated for introduction in 2012 based on the same \\"C-Evo\\" platform as the Alfa Romeo Giulietta. In October 2011, Chrysler trademarked four names: Hornet, Dart, Duster, and Camber. One month later, the head of the Dodge brand, Reid Bigland, stated that Hornet will not be used for the new car. The automaker \\"surprised industry pundits and insiders\\" with an announcement that the small sedan for 2013 will be called the Dodge Dart (PF). For a long time, both company insiders and industry experts \\"had insisted that the compact Dodge would be called the Dodge Hornet, in homage not only to the well-received 2006 concept car that carried the name but also to an ancestry of vehicles stretching back 60 years to the original Hudson Hornet.\\"  Notes   References     External links  * AMC Hornet information pages (archived) AMC Rambler Club * American Motors Owners Association Hornet Category:Compact cars Category:Coup√©s Category:Hatchbacks Category:Rear-wheel-drive vehicles Category:Sedans Category:Station wagons Category:Cars introduced in 1970 ","title":"AMC Hornet"},{"id":"1244836","text":"Jingle All the Way is a 1996 American Christmas family comedy film directed by Brian Levant. It stars Arnold Schwarzenegger and Sinbad as two rival fathers, workaholic Howard Langston (Schwarzenegger) and stressed out postal worker Myron Larabee (Sinbad), both desperately trying to purchase a Turbo-Man action figure for their respective sons on a last-minute shopping spree on Christmas Eve. Inspired by real-life Christmas toy sell-outs for such items as Cabbage Patch Kids, the film was written by Randy Kornfield. Producer Chris Columbus rewrote the script, adding in elements of satire about the commercialization of Christmas, and the project was picked up by 20th Century Fox. Delays to Fox's reboot of Planet of the Apes allowed Schwarzenegger to come on board the film, while Columbus opted to cast Sinbad ahead of Joe Pesci as Myron. Jingle All the Way was set and filmed in the Twin Cities of Minneapolis and Saint Paul at a variety of locations, including the Mall of America. After five weeks filming, production moved to California where scenes such as the end parade were shot. The film's swift production meant merchandising was limited to a replica of the Turbo-Man action figure used in the film. The film has a 15% approval rating on Rotten Tomatoes, citing its \\"uneven tone\\" that does not balance slapstick and satire well. It grossed $129 million worldwide, and it receives regular broadcasts on television during the Christmas season. In 2001, Fox was ordered to pay $19 million to Murray Hill Publishing for stealing the idea for the film; the verdict was overturned three years later. Jingle All the Way is also the third and final collaboration between Sinbad and Phil Hartman after Coneheads (1993) and Houseguest (1995), and the last film featuring Hartman to be released during his lifetime. Despite the negative critical reception, it is very popular during Christmas and is often shown on TV throughout the holiday season. The film's title is borrowed from the lyrics of the popular Christmas song Jingle Bells. Plot Workaholic Minneapolis mattress salesman Howard Langston loves his wife, Liz, and nine- year-old son, Jamie, but is unable to find time for his family and often put in a bad light by his neighbor, divorc√© Ted Maltin, who harbors unrequited feelings for Liz. After missing Jamie's karate class graduation, Howard resolves to redeem himself by fulfilling Jamie's Christmas wish of an action figure of Turbo-Man, a popular television superhero, despite Liz actually having asked him to buy one two weeks earlier, which Howard forgot about. On Christmas Eve, Howard sets out to buy the toy, but finds that every store has sold out, and in the process develops a rivalry with Myron Larabee, a postal worker father with the same ambition. In desperation, Howard attempts to buy a figure from a counterfeit toy brand, which results in a massive fight in the warehouse that is broken up when the police arrive. Howard narrowly escapes arrest by posing as an undercover officer. Exhausted at his failure and out of fuel, Howard goes to Mickey's Diner and calls home, intending to tell his wife the truth. Jamie answers the phone but keeps reminding Howard of his promise to be home in time for the annual Holiday Wintertainment Parade. Losing his patience, Howard yells at Jamie, after which he feels guilty and depressed after Jamie scolds him for not keeping his promises. Howard finds Myron at the diner and they share their experiences over coffee, where Myron tells Howard of his resentment towards his own father for failing to get him a Johnny Seven OMA for Christmas. A radio station advertises a competition for a Turbo-Man doll. The ensuing fight between Howard and Myron results in the diner's phone getting damaged, forcing Howard and Myron to race to the radio station on foot, where the DJ tells them that the competition was actually for a Turbo- Man gift certificate. The police are alerted, but Howard and Myron escape after Myron threatens the officers with a letter bomb, which one officer sets off by accident. Upon returning to his car, Howard finds it stripped by car thieves, with \\"Merry X-Mas\\" spray-painted on the windshield. He returns home in a tow truck only to find Ted putting the star on his Christmas tree. In retaliation, Howard attempts to steal the Turbo-Man doll Ted bought for his son, Johnny, but is caught in the act and left alone while his family go to the Christmas parade with Ted. After letting Jamie and Johnny out of the car, Ted attempts to seduce Liz, but she violently rejects him by hitting him with a thermos of eggnog that Ted offered to her. Meanwhile, remembering his promise to Jamie to go to the parade, Howard decides to attend as well, but runs into the officer from the radio station. The ensuing chase leads to Howard hiding inside a storage room, where he is mistaken for the actor portraying Turbo-Man and dressed in the highly technological costume. As Turbo-Man, Howard uses his chance to present a limited-edition action figure to Jamie, but they are confronted by Myron, dressed as Turbo-Man's enemy, Dementor. Despite Howard's pleas for Myron to stop, a long chase ensues, involving even a jetpack flight. Myron acquires the toy from Jamie but is cornered by police officers, while Howard saves his son. Howard reveals himself to his family and apologizes for his shortcomings. The police return the toy to Jamie as Myron is arrested, but Jamie decides to give the toy to Myron for his son, proclaiming his father as his true hero. In a post-credits scene, that night, Howard finishes decorating their Christmas tree by putting the star on top. But when Liz asks Howard what he got for her, he realizes in horror that he forgot to get Liz a gift. Cast Production =Development= The film draws inspiration from the high demand for Christmas toys such as the Cabbage Patch Kids and Mighty Morphin Power Rangers in the late 1980s and early 1990s, which often led to intense searching and occasional violence among shoppers over finding the toys. Randy Kornfield wrote the film's original screenplay after witnessing his in-laws go to a Santa Monica toy store at dawn in order to get his son a Power Ranger. While admitting to missing the clamor for the Cabbage Patch Kids and Power Rangers, producer Chris Columbus experienced a similar situation in 1995 when he attempted to obtain a Buzz Lightyear action figure from the film Toy Story, released that year. As a result, he rewrote Kornfield's script, which was accepted by 20th Century Fox. Columbus was always \\"attracted to the dark side of the happiest holiday of the year\\", so wrote elements of the film as a satire of the commercialization of Christmas. Brian Levant was hired to direct the film. Columbus said Levant \\"underst[ood] the humor in the material\\" and \\"was very animated and excited, and he had a vision of what he wanted to do\\". Levant said \\"The story that was important to me was between the father and son ... it's a story about love, and a father's journey to deliver it in the form of a Turbo Man doll. The fact that I got to design a toy line and do the commercials and make pajamas and comic books was fun for me as a filmmaker. But at its root, the movie's about something really sweet. It's about love and building a better family. I think that's consistent with everything I've done.\\" Arnold Schwarzenegger was quickly cast. He became available in February 1996 after Fox's remake of Planet of the Apes was held up again; Columbus also exited that project to work on Jingle All the Way. The film marks Schwarzenegger's fourth appearance as the lead in a comedy film, following Twins (1988), Kindergarten Cop (1990) and Junior (1994). Schwarzenegger was paid a reported $20 million for the role. He enjoyed the film, having experienced last-minute Christmas shopping himself, and was attracted to playing an \\"ordinary\\" character in a family film. Columbus initially wanted Joe Pesci to play Myron. Comedian Sinbad was chosen instead, partly due to his similar height and size to Schwarzenegger. Sinbad was suggested for the part by Schwarzenegger's agent, but the producers felt he was unsuited to the role of a villain as it could harm his clean, family-oriented comedy act and reputation, although Sinbad felt the character would generate the audience's sympathy rather than hate. Furthermore, he missed the audition due to his appearance with First Lady Hillary Clinton and musician Sheryl Crow on the USO tour of Bosnia and Herzegovina, but Columbus waited for him to return to allow him to audition and, although Sinbad felt he had \\"messed\\" it up, he was given the part. He improvised the majority of his lines in the film; Schwarzenegger also improvised many of his responses in his conversations with Sinbad's character. =Filming= Filming took place in Minnesota for five weeks from April 15, 1996; at the time, it was the largest film production to ever take place in the state. Jingle All the Way was set and filmed in the Twin Cities metropolitan area of Minnesota at locations such as Bloomington's Mall of America, Mickey's Diner, downtown Minneapolis, Linden Hills, residential areas of Edina and primarily downtown Saint Paul. Unused shops in the Seventh Place Mall area were redecorated to resemble Christmas decorated stores, while the Energy Park Studios were used for much of the filming and the Christmas lights stayed up at Rice Park for use in the film. The Mall of America and the state's \\"semi-wintry weather\\" proved attractive for the studio. Although Schwarzenegger stated that the locals were \\"well-behaved\\" and \\"cooperative\\", Levant often found filming \\"impossible\\" due to the scale and noise of the crowds who came to watch production, especially in the Mall of America, but overall found the locals to be \\"respectful\\" and \\"lovely people.\\" Levant spent several months in the area before filming in order to prepare. The film uses artistic license by treating Minneapolis and Saint Paul as one city, as this was logistically easier; the police are labeled \\"Twin Cities Police\\" in the film. Additionally, the city's Holidazzle Parade is renamed the Wintertainment Parade and takes place on 2nd Avenue during the day, rather than Nicollet Mall at night. Levant wanted to film the parade at night but was overruled for practical reasons. The parade was filmed at Universal Studios Hollywood in California on the New York Street set, due to safety concerns. The set was designed to resemble 2nd Avenue; the parade was shot from above by helicopters and stitched into matte shots of the real-life street. It took three weeks to film, with 1,500 extras being used in the scene, along with three custom designed floats. Other parts of the film to be shot in Los Angeles, California included store interiors, and the warehouse fight scene between Howard and the criminal Santas, for which a Pasadena furniture warehouse was used. Turbo-Man was created and designed for the film. This meant the commercials and scenes from the Turbo-Man TV series were all shot by Levant, while all of the Turbo- Man merchandise, packaging and props shown in the film were custom made one- offs and designed to look \\"authentic, as if they all sprang from the same well.\\" Along with Columbus and Levant, production designer Leslie McDonald and character designer Tim Flattery crafted Turbo-Man, Booster and Dementor and helped make the full-size Turbo-Man suit for the film's climax. Principal production finished in August; Columbus \\"fine-tun[ed] the picture until the last possible minute,\\" using multiple test audiences \\"to see where the big laughs actually lie.\\" Music =Soundtrack= TVT Records released the film's soundtrack album on Audio CD on November 26, 1996. It features only two of composer David Newman's pieces from Jingle All the Way, but features many of the songs by other artists included in the film, as well as other Christmas songs and new tracks by the Brian Setzer Orchestra. Intrada Music Group released a Special Collection limited edition of Newman's full 23-track score on November 3, 2008. =Track listing= Release As Schwarzenegger only signed on for the film in February and the film was shot so quickly, only six and a half months were available for merchandising, instead of the ideal year. As such, merchandising was limited to a 13.5 inch replica $25 Talking Turbo- Man action figure and the West Coast exclusive Turbo-Man Time Racer vehicle, while no tie-in promotions could be secured. Despite this, several critics wrote that the film was only being made in order to sell the toy. Columbus dismissed this notion, stating that with only roughly 200,000 Turbo-Man toys being made, the merchandising was far less than the year's other releases, such as Space Jam and 101 Dalmatians. The film's release coincided with the Tickle Me Elmo craze, in which high demand for the doll during the 1996 Christmas season lead to store mobbing similar to that depicted for Turbo-Man. The world premiere was held on November 16, 1996, at the Mall of America in Bloomington where parts of the film were shot. A day of events was held to celebrate the film's release and Schwarzenegger donated memorabilia from the film to the Mall's Planet Hollywood. Opening on November 22, Jingle All the Way made $12.1 million in its first weekend, opening at #4 behind Star Trek: First Contact, Space Jam and Ransom; it went on to gross $129 million worldwide, recouping its $75 million budget. The film was released on VHS in October 1997, and in November 1998 it was released on DVD. It was rereleased on DVD in December 2004, followed by an extended director's cut in October 2007, known as the \\"Family Fun Edition\\". It contained several minutes of extra footage, as well as other DVD extras such as a behind the scenes featurette. In December of the following year, the Family Fun Edition was released on Blu- ray Disc. The film was released in the United Kingdom on December 6, 1996, and topped the country's box office that weekend. =Critical response= On review aggregation website Rotten Tomatoes, the film holds an approval rating of 15% based on 46 reviews and an average rating of 3.9/10. The site's critical consensus reads, \\"Arnold Schwarzenegger tries his best, but Jingle All the Way suffers from an uneven tone, shifting wildly from a would-be satire on materialism to an antic, slapstick yuk-fest.\\" Audiences polled by CinemaScore gave the film an average grade of \\"B+\\" on an A+ to F scale. Emanuel Levy felt the film \\"highly formulaic\\" and criticized Levant's direction as little more advanced than a television sitcom. Although he felt that the script did not provide sufficient opportunity for Hartman, Wilson and Conrad to give exceptional performances, he opined that \\"Schwarzenegger has developed a light comic delivery, punctuated occasionally by an ironic one- liner,\\" while \\"Sinbad has good moments\\". Neil Jeffries of Empire disagreed, feeling Schwarzenegger to be \\"wooden\\" and Sinbad to be \\"trying desperately to be funnier than his hat\\" but praised Lloyd as the \\"saving grace\\" of the film. The New York Times critic Janet Maslin felt the film lacked any real plot, failed in its attempt at satire, should have included Myron's only mentioned son and \\"mostly wasted\\" Hartman, while Levant's direction was \\"listless\\". Similarly, the BBC's Neil Smith criticized the film's script, its focus on the commercialization of Christmas, as well as Schwarzenegger's performance which shows \\"the comic timing of a dead moose,\\" but singled out Hartman for praise. Chicago Tribune critic Michael Wilmington panned the film, wondering why the characters (primarily Howard) acted so illogically: \\"Howard Langston is supposed to be a successful mattress manufacturer, but the movie paints him as a hot-tempered buffoon without a sensible idea in his head.\\" Jack Garner of USA Today condemned the film, finding it more \\"cynical\\" than satirical, stating \\"this painfully bad movie has been inspired strictly by the potential jingle of cash registers.\\" He wrote of Levant's directorial failure as he \\"offers no ... sense of comic timing,\\" while \\"pauses in the midst of much of the dialogue are downright painful.\\" Trevor Johnston suggested that the film \\"seems to mark a point of decline in the Schwarzenegger career arc\\" and the anti-consumerism message largely failed, with \\"Jim Belushi's corrupt mall Santa with his stolen-goods warehouse ... provid[ing] the film's sole flash of dark humour.\\" IGN's Mike Drucker praised its subject matter as \\"one of the few holiday movies to directly deal with the commercialization of Christmas\\" although felt the last twenty minutes of the film let it down, as the first hour or so had \\"some family entertainment\\" value if taken with a \\"grain of salt\\". He concluded the film was \\"a member of the so-corny-its-good genre,\\" while \\"Arnold delivers plenty of one-liners ripe for sound board crank callers.\\" Jamie Malanowski of The New York Times praised the film's satirical premise but felt it was \\"full of unrealized potential\\" because \\"the filmmakers [wrongly] equate mayhem with humor.\\" Roger Ebert gave the film two-and-a-half stars, writing that he \\"liked a lot of the movie\\", which he thought had \\"energy\\" and humor which would have mass audience appeal. He was, though, disappointed by \\"its relentlessly materialistic view of Christmas, and by the choice to go with action and (mild) violence over dialogue and plot.\\" Kevin Carr of 7M Pictures concluded that while the film is not very good, as a form of family entertainment it is \\"surprisingly fun.\\" At the 1996 Stinkers Bad Movie Awards, the film was nominated for three awards: Worst Actor (Arnold Schwarzenegger), Worst Supporting Actress (Rita Wilson), and Most Painfully Unfunny Comedy. Brian Levant was nominated for the Razzie Award for Worst Director, but lost to Andrew Bergman for Striptease; Sinbad won the Blockbuster Entertainment Award for Favorite Supporting Actor in a Family film. =Lawsuit= In 1998, Murray Hill Publishing sued 20th Century Fox for $150,000, claiming that the idea for the film was stolen from a screenplay they had purchased from high school teacher Brian Webster entitled Could This Be Christmas? They said the script had 36 similarities with Jingle All the Way, including the plot, dialogue and character names. Murray Hill President Bob Laurel bought the script from Webster in 1993, and sent it to Fox and other studios in 1994 but received no response and claimed the idea was copied by Kornfield, who was Fox's script reader. In 2001, Fox were found guilty of stealing the idea and ordered to pay $19 million ($15 million in damages and $4 million in legal costs) to Murray Hill, with Webster to receive a portion. Laurel died a few months after the verdict, before receiving any of the money. On appeal, the damages figure was lowered to $1.5 million, before the verdict itself was quashed in 2004 after a judge decided the idea was not stolen, as Fox had bought Kornfield's screenplay before he or anybody else at Fox had read Could This Be Christmas? Sequel Over 18 years after the release of the original film, a stand-alone sequel, Jingle All the Way 2, was released straight-to-DVD in December 2014. Directed by Alex Zamm and produced by WWE Studios and 20th Century Fox, the film has a similar plot to the original, but is otherwise not connected and has none of the original cast or characters. The lead roles were instead played by Larry the Cable Guy and Santino Marella.

He is renowned for developing a style of cinematographic perspective known as distance montage, combining perception of depth with oncoming entities, such as running packs of antelope or hordes of humans. Filmmaker Sergei Parajanov has referred to Peleshyan as \\"one of the few authentic geniuses in the world of cinema\\". Peleshyan was awarded the title of Merited Artist of the Armenian SSR in 1979, and Merited Artist of the Russian Federation in 1995. His films have been described as being on the border between a documentary and a feature film, somewhat reminiscent of the work of such avant-garde filmmakers as Bruce Conner, rather than of conventional documentaries. However, it has been noted that his work, unlike Maya Deren's, is not firmly within the avant-garde, and that it does not try to explore the absurd. Peleshyan's films have been summarized as \\"a poetic view of life transferred onto film.\\" He has made extensive use of archive footage, mixed in with his own shots, with fast inter-cutting between the two. Telephoto lenses are often used to get \\"candid camera\\" shots of people engaging in mundane tasks. Most of Peleshyan's films are short, ranging from 6 to about 60 minutes long, and feature no dialogue. However, music and sound effects play nearly as important a role in his films as the visual images in contributing towards the artistic whole. Nearly all of his films were shot in black-and-white. Works Peleshyan's early films, made when he was still a student at VGIK, were awarded several prizes. Twelve films by Peleshyan are known to exist. The Beginning ( Skizbe) (1967) is a cinematographical essay about the October Revolution of 1917. One of the unique visual effects used in this film is achieved by holding snippets of film still on a single frame, then advancing only for a second or two before again pausing on another, resulting in a stuttering visual effect. Other important films by him are We ( Menq) (1967), a poetically told history of Armenia and its people, and Inhabitants ( Obitateli) (1970), a reflection on the relationship between wildlife and humans. Artavazd Peleshian's most significant film is considered, by many critics, to be The Seasons ( Tarva yeghanaknere) (1975), shot by cinematographer Mikhail Vartanov.IDFA - International Documentary Film Festival Amsterdam It is a look at the contradiction and harmony between humans and nature and was the last collaboration between Peleshian and Vartanov, Armenia's two most important documentary auteurs, who first worked together on The Autumn Pastoral ( Ashnanayin hovvergutyun) (1971).Parajanov- Vartanov Institute on Peleshian Peleshyan is also the author of a range of theoretical works, such as his 1988 book, My Cinema ( Moyo kino). Being from a country removed from internationally significant cinema circles, Peleshyan's efforts were not initially well-recognized by critics of world cinema. Since the fall of the Soviet Union, he has made two more short films, Life ( Kyanq) (1993) and The End (1994). He is now living in Moscow. His most recent film was edited at the ZKM  Karlsruhe Film Institute in 2005-2006 and has not yet been released. Personal commentary In 1998, Peleshyan reflected on his approach to filmmaking and cinematography, > \\"It's about what I'm striving for, what we're all striving for - every > person, humanity [...] the wishes and desires of the people to ascend, to > transcend [...] I was thinking of everything. It's not specifically the > seasons of the year or of people: it's everything [...] Eisenstein's montage > was linear, like a chain. Distance montage creates a magnetic field around > the film [...] Sometimes I don't call my method 'montage'. I'm involved in a > process of creating unity. In a sense I've eliminated montage: by creating > the film through montage, I have destroyed montage. In the totality, in the > wholeness of one of my films, there is no montage, no collision, so as a > result montage has been destroyed. In Eisenstein every element means > something. For me the individual fragments don't mean anything anymore. Only > the whole film has the meaning [...] For me, distance montage opens up the > mysteries of the movement of the universe.

Mew wrote \\"The Farmer's Bride\\" in the late 19th century, using it as the opening poem for her first poetry collection, of the same name, in 1916. The collection was published in chapbook format by the Poetry Bookshop. In the US, it was published in 1921 under the title Saturday Market. The title poem is a poignant lament by an inarticulate farmer about his love for his young wife and her inability to respond to him either physically or emotionally.  The Poem  Three Summers since I chose a maid, Too young maybe ‚Äì but more's to do At harvest-time than bide and woo. When us was wed she turned afraid Of love and me and all things human; Like the shut of a winter's day Her smile went out, and 'twasn't a woman ‚Äì More like a little frightened fay. One night, in the Fall, she runned away. 'Out 'mong the sheep, her be,' they said, Should properly have been abed; But sure enough she wasn't there Lying awake with her wide brown stare. So over seven-acre field and up-along across the down We chased her, flying like a hare Before our lanterns. To Church-Town All in a shiver and a scare We caught her, fetched her home at last And turned the key upon her, fast. She does the work about the house As well as most, but like the mouse: Happy enough to chat and play With birds and rabbits as such as they, So long as men-folk keep away. 'Not near, not near!' her eyes beseech When one of us comes within reach. The women say that beasts in stall Look round like children at her call I've hardly heard her speak at all Shy as a leveret, swift as he, Straight and slight as a young larch tree, Sweet as the first wild violets, she, To her wild self. But what to me? The short days shorten and the oaks are brown, The blue smoke rises to the low grey sky, One leaf in the still air falls slowly down, A magpie's spotted feathers lie On the black earth spread white with rime, The berries redden up to Christmas- time. What's Christmas-time without there be Some other in the house than we! She sleeps up in the attic there Alone, poor maid. 'Tis but a stair Betwixt us. Oh! my God! the down, The soft young down of her; the brown, The brown of her ‚Äì her eyes, her hair, her hair! Analysis ‚ÄúThe Farmer‚Äôs Bride‚Äù was a groundbreaking piece of work that shed light on Charlotte Mew's literary expertise and unique style of writing. This poem emerged in 1912 when first published in The Nation and again as a collection under its title in 1916 by Harold Monro's Poetry Bookshop. Mew's life, which she kept very private, was full of tumultuous sorrow, loss, and upheaval from a very young age. As the oldest daughter of seven children she watched as several of her siblings were institutionalized, suffered from mental illness, and eventually committed suicide.\\"Charlotte Mew.\\" Poetry Foundation.

He was educated in Jerusalem, Damascus and Erzurum before attending Galatasaray High School. He studied political science in Paris, where he was also a correspondent of the Turkish newspaper Tanin. He returned to Turkey in 1910, where he edited the newspaper Ifham. He also gave lectures on law and economics. In 1913 he was accused of involvement in the assassination of Mahmud ≈ûevket Pasha and sentenced to fifteen years of exile in Sinop. Here he contributed articles about western philosophy to the periodicals Ictiha and Hak. However, in 1914 he escaped from Sinop and fled to Russia, where, following the outbreak of the First World War, Russian authorities regarded him as a prisoner of war and sent him into exile in the Ural region. = Communist activism = Communist Party of Turkey founder Mustafa Subhi (right), general secretary Ethem Nejat (middle) and ƒ∞smail Hakkƒ± (left) Manifesto of the Communist Party, translated to Turkish language by Mustafa Subhi in 1919 (unfinished) In 1915, whilst in the Urals he joined the Bolshevik Party.

At the First Congress of Communist Party of Turkey, held in Baku on 10 September 1920, Subhi was elected its chairman and went to Anatolia. He was one of the 15 Communists that went to Turkey to join the Turkish War of Independence. After encountering hostility in Erzurum, the communists tried to return to Baku. However, they were murdered by Sailor Yahya after setting sail from Trabzon on the night of 28 January 1921. According to other sources he was murdered by a group of pro-Enver supporters from Trabzon, apparently because of the fear that Subhi might expose Enver's plans of political activities in Moscow and his ultimate intention of using the Bolsheviks to regain power in Turkey once the nationalists were defeated.K Gajendra Singh, Occupation case studies: Algeria and Turkey Asia Times, 7 January 2004 :There is need to provide army service area in order to establish links between the partisan troops in various locations of Anatolia and there is need to establish Military- Revolution Committee so as to strengthen this movement.

Bloc Party Moakes became a member of Bloc Party after responding to an advertisement placed in the NME music magazine by Kele Okereke and Russell Lissack, who were seeking a bassist. Although not originally a bassist, Moakes was the only player the band auditioned who was able to play the bassline for a song that Okereke and Lissack had presented. In 2002, Moakes, Lissack, and Okereke formed the first incarnation of Bloc Party ‚Äì then known as The Angel Range ‚Äì and played shows across London. Moakes also ran and updated the band's website at the time. Moakes shared co-writing credits with Okereke on some of the band's earlier lyrics. In the early days of the band, he contributed lyrics mostly to the band's more political songs, and he composed the song \\"Diet\\". Moakes added new instruments to his repertoire on Bloc Party's second and third albums, A Weekend in the City and Intimacy respectively. He played drums on \\"Sunday\\", electronic drums on \\"Ares\\", glockenspiel on \\"Waiting for the 7.18\\" and \\"SRXT\\" and a microKORG synthesizer on \\"Flux\\". His voice can be heard in many of the band's songs, often in contrast with Okereke's lead vocals. Moakes remixed the band's song \\"Talons\\" from their album Intimacy.

(September 2004; online edn, May 2006) \\"Charles Edward (1720‚Äì1788)\\", Oxford Dictionary of National Biography, Oxford University Press, , retrieved 14 December 2007 (subscription required) (29 October 1753 ‚Äì 17 November 1789) was the illegitimate daughter of the Jacobite pretender Prince Charles Edward Stuart ('Bonnie Prince Charlie' or the 'Young Pretender') and his only child to survive infancy. Her mother was Clementina Walkinshaw, who was mistress to the Prince from 1752 until 1760. After years of abuse, Clementina left him, taking Charlotte with her. Charlotte spent most of her life in French convents, estranged from a father who refused to make any provision for her. Unable to marry, she herself became a mistress with illegitimate children, taking Ferdinand de Rohan, Archbishop of Bordeaux, as her lover. She was finally reconciled with her father in 1784, when he legitimised her and created her Duchess of Albany in the Jacobite Peerage. She left her own children with her mother, and became her father's carer and companion in the last years of his life, before dying less than two years after him. Her three children were raised in anonymity; however, as the only grandchildren of the pretender, they have been the subject of Jacobite interest since their lineage was uncovered in the 20th century. Royal parentage Prince Charles Edward 1745 Clementina Walkinshaw c. 1760 Charlotte Stuart was born on 29 October 1753 at Li√®ge to Charles and his mistress Clementina Walkinshaw, whom he had met during the Jacobite rising of 1745 (when he came to Scotland from France in an attempt to regain by force the thrones of England, Scotland and Ireland, which had been lost by his grandfather, James II and VII, in 1689). Clementina (1720‚Äì1802) was the youngest of the ten daughters of John Walkinshaw of Barrowhill (1671‚Äì1731). The Walkinshaws owned the lands of Barrowfield and Camlachie, and her father had become a wealthy Glasgow merchant (founding the textile village of Calton). However, he was also an Episcopalian Protestant and a Jacobite who had fought for the Prince's father in the rising of 1715, been captured at the Battle of Sheriffmuir, before escaping from Stirling Castle and fleeing to Europe. In 1717, he had been pardoned by the British Government and returned to Glasgow, where his youngest daughter was born probably at Camlachie. However, Clementina was largely educated on the Continent, and later converted to Roman Catholicism. In 1746, she was living at the home of her uncle Sir Hugh Paterson at Bannockburn, near Stirling. The Prince came to Sir Hugh's home in early January 1746 where he first met Clementina, and he returned later that month to be nursed by her from what appears to have been a cold. Given that she was living under her uncle's protection, it is not thought the two were lovers at this time.Kybert, p. 190 After the defeat of the Prince's rebellion at Culloden in April 1746, Charles fled Scotland for France. In the following years, he had a scandalous affair with his 22-year-old first cousin Louise de Montbazon (who was married to his close friend, and whom he deserted when she became pregnant) and then with the Princess of Talmont, who was in her 40s. In 1752, he heard that Clementina was at Dunkirk and in some financial difficulties, so he sent 50 louis d'or to help her and then dispatched Sir Henry Goring to entreat her to come to Ghent and live with him as his mistress. Goring, who described Clementina as a \\"bad woman\\", complained of being used as \\"no better than a pimp\\", and shortly after left Charles's employ.Letter of June 1752, quoted by Kybert, p. 269 However, by November 1752, Clementina was living with Charles, and was to remain as his mistress for the following eight years. The couple moved to Li√®ge where Charlotte, their only child, was born on 29 October 1753Kybert, p. 269 and baptised into the Roman Catholic faith at the church of Sainte Marie-des- Fonts.Douglas, Hugh (2004) \\"Walkinshaw, Clementine, styled countess of Albestroff (c.1720‚Äì1802)\\", Oxford Dictionary of National Biography, Oxford University Press, , retrieved 14 December 2007 (subscription required) Separation from father (1760‚Äì1783) Cardinal Henry Stuart, Charlotte's unclePortrait by Anton Raphael Mengs, 1756 (Mus√©e Fabre, Avignon) The relationship between prince and mistress was disastrous. Charles was already a disillusioned, angry alcoholic when they began living together, and he became violent towards, and insanely possessive of, Clementina, treating her as a \\"submissive whipping post\\".Kybert p. 270 Often away from home on \\"jaunts\\", he seldom referred to his daughter, and when he did, it was as \\"ye cheild\\". During a temporary move to Paris, the Prince's lieutenants record ugly public arguments between the two, and that his drunkenness and temper were damaging his reputation. By 1760, they were in Basel, and Clementina had had enough of Charles's intoxication and their nomadic lifestyle. She contacted his staunchly Roman Catholic father, James Stuart ('the Old Pretender'), and expressed a desire to secure a Catholic education for Charlotte and to retire to a convent.Kybert, p. 271 (In 1750, during an incognito visit to London, Charles had nominally disavowed Roman Catholicism for the Anglican Church.) James agreed to pay her an annuity of 10,000 livres and, in July 1760, there is evidence to suggest he aided her escape from the watchful Charles, with the seven-year-old Charlotte, to the convent of the Nuns of the Visitation in Paris. She left a letter for Charles expressing her devotion to him but complaining she had had to flee in fear of her life. A furious Charles circulated descriptions of them both, but it was to no avail.Kybert, p. 271‚Äì2 =Appeals from France= For the next twelve years, Clementina and Charlotte continued to live in various French convents, supported by the 10,000 livre pension granted by James Stuart. Charles never forgave Clementina for depriving him of \\"ye cheild\\", and stubbornly refused to pay anything for their support. On 1 January 1766 James died, but Charles, (now considering himself de jure Charles III of Scotland, England and Ireland) still refused to make any provision for the two, forcing Clementina, now styling herself \\"Countess Alberstroff\\", to appeal to his brother Cardinal Henry Stuart for assistance. Henry gave them an allowance of 5,000 livres, but in return extracted a statement from Clementina that she had never been married to Charles ‚Äì a statement she later tried to retract.Kybert, p. 282‚Äì3 This lower amount forced them to find cheaper lodgings in the convent of Notre Dame at Meaux-en-Brie. Louise of Stolberg-Gedern, Charles's wife, was only months older than his daughter. In 1772, the Prince, then aged fifty-one, married the nineteen- year-old Princess Louise of Stolberg-Gedern (who was only a year older than Charlotte). Charlotte, now in penury, had consistently been writing to her father for some time, and she now desperately entreated him to legitimise her, provide support, and bring her to Rome before an heir could be born. In April 1772, Charlotte wrote a touching, yet pleading, letter to \\"mon Augusta Papa\\" which was sent via Principal Gordon of the Scots College in Rome. Charles relented and offered to bring Charlotte to Rome (he was now resident in the Palazzo Muti ‚Äì the residence of the Stuarts-in-exile), but only on condition she would leave her mother behind in France. This she loyally refused to do, and Charles, in fury, broke off all discussions.Kybert, p. 283‚Äì4 =Mistress of an Archbishop= Towards the end of 1772, Clementina and Charlotte unexpectedly arrived in Rome to press their desperate cause in person. (The trip pushed Clementina further into debt.) However, the Prince reacted angrily, refusing even to see them, forcing their helpless return to France, from where Charlotte's pleading letters continued.Kybert, p. 285 Three years later, Charlotte, now in her twenty-second year and already in poor health, (she was apparently suffering from a liver ailment shared by the Stuarts) decided her only option was to marry as soon as possible. Charles, however, refused to give permission either for her to marry or to take the veil, and she was left awaiting his royal pleasure.Kybert p. 287‚Äì8 Lacking legitimacy or permission, Charlotte was unable to marry. Thus, she otherwise sought a protector and provider. Probably unbeknown to Charles, she became the mistress of Ferdinand Maximilien M√©riadec de Rohan, Archbishop of Bordeaux and Cambrai. Ferdinand de Rohan ‚Äì related by blood to the house of Stuart as well as Bourbon and Lorraine ‚Äì was also unable to marry legitimately, having entered the Church as a younger son of a noble house. By him, she had three children: two daughters, Marie Victoire and Charlotte, and finally a son, Charles Edward. Her children were kept secret, and remained largely unknown until the 20th century. When Charlotte eventually left France for Florence, she entrusted the children ‚Äì and she was only just recovering from her son's birthKybert, p. 304 ‚Äì to the care of her mother, and it appears that few, and certainly not her father, knew of their existence. Reconciliation Charlotte Stuart (again by Hugh Douglas Hamilton) Only after his childless marriage to Louise was over, and Charles had fallen seriously ill, did he take an interest in Charlotte. She was now thirty, and she had not seen her father since she was seven. On 23 March 1783, he altered his will to make her his heir and, a week later, signed an act of legitimisation. This act, recognising her as his natural daughter and entitling her to succeed to his private estate, was sent to Louis XVI of France. Henry Stuart, however, contested the legitimisation as being irregular and confusing to the succession. Louis XVI eventually did confirm the act and register it with the Parlement of Paris, but not until 6 September 1787. In July 1784, having granted Louise a legal separation, Charles summoned Charlotte to Florence, where he was now resident and, in November, installed her in the Palazzo Guadagni as Duchess of Albany, styling her \\"Her Royal Highness\\" ‚Äì and appointing her to the Order of the Thistle. Nevertheless, being illegitimate at birth, Charlotte still had no right of succession to the Stuart claim to the British throne. However, by this stage, the claims were of little value. European rulers had long since ceased to take Charles seriously. Even Pope Pius VI was refusing to recognise his royal title, and the famous Casanova had wittily called him the \\"pretender-in-vain\\". He was reduced to styling himself the 'Count d'Albany'. That a Stuart restoration was now less than unlikely did not prevent the Prince presenting Charlotte as the next generation of the cause. He had medals struck for her, bearing the figure of Hope, the map of England, and the Stuart arms with legends such as \\"Spes Tamen Est Una\\" (there is one hope). He also had her idealised in art; the Scottish artist Gavin Hamilton was commissioned to draw her in chalk in the neo-classical style, whilst Hugh Douglas Hamilton painted a flattering portrait in a tiara. =Companion to her father= Charles Stuart in 1775 by Hugh Douglas Hamilton, Scottish National Portrait Gallery. When Charlotte arrived to live with her father in 1784, he was an ailing alcoholic. She found his physical state disgusting, and he was suffering from mental degeneration and using a litter for travel. He did, however, introduce Charlotte into society, allowing her to wear his mother's famous Sobieska jewellery.Kybert, p. 305 She continually, and unsuccessfully, sought gifts of jewels or money from her close-fisted father;Kybert, p. 307 but this was probably largely out of a concern for the welfare of her mother and children. Within a month of arriving at Florence, she did manage to persuade her father to provide at last for Clementina. By this time, Charlotte was also in poor health, suffering from an ailment that would result in her death from \\"obstruction of the liver\\" just two years after her father. Indeed, shortly after she arrived in Florence, a protruding growth forced her to have clothes altered. Charlotte sorely missed her mother (whom she vainly hoped Charles would allow to come to Rome) and her children, writing to her mother as many as 100 times in a single year; she also feared that Rohan would take another lover; all this is revealed in her dispirited letters home, as she awaited Charles's death. =Final months= In December 1785, she enlisted the help of Henry Stuart to get Charles back to the Palazzo Muti in Rome. There, Charlotte remained her father's carer and companion and did her best to make his life bearable until he died of a stroke two years later (31 January 1788). Her sacrifice for him was considerable‚Äîshe was torn between an evident affection for her father and her mother and three children left behind in Paris. Charlotte survived her father by only twenty-two months and never saw her children again. On 9 October 1789, she arrived at the Palazzo Vizzani Sanguinetti (now Palazzo Ranuzzi) in Bologna, the home of her friend the Marchesa Giulia Lambertini-Bovio. She died there at age 36 of liver cancer (17 November 1789). In her will, written just three days before her death, Charlotte left her mother, Clementina, a sum of 50,000 livres and an annuity of a further 15,000. However, it was two years before Henry Stuart, her executor, and now considered by Jacobites to be King Henry IX, would release the money. Indeed, he only agreed to do this when Clementina signed a \\"quittance\\" renouncing, on behalf of herself and her descendants, any further claim on the estate.Kybert, p. 312 Charlotte was buried in the Church of San Biagio, near where she died. When the church was pulled down by the French in 1797, Charlotte's remains were moved to the Oratorio della Santissima Trinit√†. When it closed in 1961, her monument (and possibly her remains) were moved to the nearby Chiesa della Santissima Trinit√†. Legacy Marie-Victoire, Princess de Rohan For many years, Charlotte's three children remained unknown to history, and it was believed that the direct line of James II and Mary of Modena ended with the death of Henry in 1807. However, in the 1950s, research by the historians Alasdair and Hetty Tayler revealed the existence of two daughters and a son. Historian George Sherburn then discovered the letters from Charlotte to her mother, from which he wrote his biography of Charles Edward. =Children= It appears that Clementina lived on in Fribourg, Switzerland, until her death in 1802 and that it was she who reared Charlotte's children in deliberate anonymity. Their identities were concealed by a variety of aliases and ruses, not even being mentioned in Charlotte's detailed will. The will makes reference only to Clementina and to Charlotte's desire that Clementina might be able to provide for \\"her necessitous relations\\". The reason these children remained secret can be explained by the fact that the relationship between Rohan, the Archbishop, and Charlotte, who had been forbidden to marry, was highly illicit and would have been scandalous. Marie Victoire Adelaide (born 1779) and Charlotte Maximilienne Am√©lie (born 1780) were thought to have been placed in the care of Thomas Coutts, the London banker, and a distant relative of the Walkinshaws. They remained in anonymity and were believed to have been simply absorbed into English society. Charlotte's son, Charles Edward, born in Paris in 1784, followed a different path. Calling himself 'Count Roehenstart' (Rohan+Stuart), he was educated by his father's family in Germany, became an officer in the Russian army, and a general in the Austrian service. He travelled widely‚Äîvisiting India, America, and the West Indies‚Äîbefore coming to England and Scotland. He told such tall tales of his origins and adventures that few believed his claims to royal descent.Kybert, p. 313 Indeed, it was not until the 20th century that historian George Sherburn established that he was indeed who he had claimed to be. He died in Scotland in 1854 as the result of a coach accident near Stirling Castle and was buried at Dunkeld Cathedral, where his grave can still be seen.His gravestone states he was 73 although, if born in 1784, he would have been 69 (Kybert, p. 313) He married twice but had no issue. Occasionally, it has been suggested that Prince Charles married Clementina Walkinshaw, and thus that Charlotte was legitimate and could legally claim to be her father's successor. However, there are no records to substantiate this claim, and the affidavit signed by Clementina on 9 March 1767 explicitly disavows the idea. Further, Charles's initial disavowal of Charlotte speaks against her legitimacy. It was generally believed that Charlotte's daughters also died without issue. However, according to Peter Pininski's research, Charlotte's elder daughter, Marie Victoire, did have issue. Pininski's 2002 book suggested that Jules-Hercule, Prince de Gu√©m√©n√© and Duke of Montbazon, elder brother of Ferdinand de Rohan (and aide-de-camp to Henry Stuart in 1745) recognised Charlotte's offspring as his own ‚Äì thus giving her status in that tight family. The book claimed that in 1793, at the outbreak of the French revolution, the Rohan family scattered; and Marie Victoire de Rohan went to relatives in Poland. There, she met and married Paul Anthony Louis Bertrand de Nikorowicz, a Polish nobleman and son of a banker. They had a son, Antime, before she was widowed four years later. (She later remarried twice: first to James d'Auvergne, a British naval captain, who died after 14 months, and then finally to Jean de Pauw, a French army officer.) Antime was to have a son, Charles, and a daughter, Julia-Th√©r√®se, who married Count Leonard Pininski and became Peter Pininski's great-great-grandmother. Pininski's evidence for his thesis has been described as \\"often indirect, if not elliptical\\"; the Rohans were a large family, and it is easy to confuse its many members. A former chairman of the Royal Stuart Society, however, stated that Pininski's evidence seemed \\"genuine\\", and genealogist Hugh Massingberd described it as \\"painstakingly researched ... proof to surely the most sceptical pedant's satisfaction\\". Pininski's hypothesis has since been disputed by Marie-Louise Backhurst in a 2013 article.\\"The marriages of the granddaughter of Bonnie Prince Charlie\\", in Genealogists' Magazine: Journal of the Society of Genealogists, vol. 31, no. 2 (June 2013) pages 45‚Äì49. Backhurst contends that the Charlotte's second daughter, who was always called Victoire Adelaide, was married firstly at St Roch, Paris, in November 1804 to a military doctor in the service of Napoleon, Pierre Joseph Marie de St Ursin (1763‚Äì1818). The marriage record has Victoire Adelaide Roehenstart, daughter of Maximilien and his wife Clementine Ruthven, the same parental record as her brother Charles. By de St Ursin she was the mother of Theodore Marie de St Ursin, who was born in Paris about 1809‚Äì10 and who was still resident in Paris in 1823, although his history has not been found. His mother married again in 1823 to one Corbet James D'Auvergne, although her place and date of death have not been found. Backhurst examined Madame Nikorowicz's baptism, marriage and death, and gives her name as Marie Victoire de Thorigny, and Backhurst suggests that she was more likely to have been the illegitimate daughter of Jules, Prince de Rohan, brother of Ferdinand and thus a first cousin to Victoire Adelaide. Pininski argues that Backhurst's interpretation is based on a destroyed document that was \\"reconstituted\\" seventy years later and that no document confirms the birth of Marie Victoire's son, whereas Pininski's publications provide original archival documents and fully describe the context.\\"The Descendants of Bonnie Prince Charlie\\" in Genealogists' Magazine, vol. 31, no. 3 (September 2013) pages 110‚Äì111. =In Jacobite folklore= Charlotte Stuart's story did not take long to enter into the Jacobite folklore. The Scots poet, Robert Burns (1759‚Äì96), a near contemporary, wrote a number of works celebrating the tragic romanticism of the Jacobite cause. Amongst them was The Bonnie Lass of Albanie, a lament to Charlotte Stuart probably written at the time of her death. Indeed, evidence from an unpublished collection of letters from Burns to Robert Ainslie reveals the Poet's fascination with Charlotte, in that he considered naming one of his own illegitimate children Charlotte after her. > This lovely maid's of nobel blood, That ruled Albion's kingdoms three; But > Oh, Alas! for her bonie face, They hae wrang'd the lass of ALBANIE.

During World War II he fought as an anti-fascist guerrilla fighter in the Malayan Peoples' Anti-Japanese Army against the Japanese occupation of Malaya. A determined anti-colonialist, he led the party's guerrilla insurgency in the Malayan Emergency (1948-1960), fighting against British and Commonwealth forces in an attempt to establish an independent socialist state. After the MCP's defeat and subsequent Malayan independence, Chin waged a second campaign (1968-1989) against the newly formed government of Malaysia in an attempt to replace its government with a socialist one from exile. This second insurgency came to an end with the Peace Agreement of Hat Yai 1989. Chin Peng died at the age of 88, in Bangkok, Thailand where he was cremated according to Buddhist rites.  Biography  = Early years = Chin Peng was born on 21 October 1924 into a middle-class family in the small seaside town of Sitiawan, in Perak state, Malaya. His ancestral home is Fuzhou, Fujian, China. His father went to live in Sitiawan in 1920. He set up a bicycle, tire and spare motor parts business with the help of a relative from Singapore.C.C. Chin and Karl Hack, Dialogues with Chin Peng, pp. 3, 38. Chin Peng attended a Chinese language school in Sitiawan. In 1937 he joined the Chinese Anti Enemy Backing Up Society (AEBUS), formed that year to send aid to China in response to Japan's aggression. According to Chin and Hack, he was not a communist then.Chin and Hack, p. 40. He was in charge of anti-Japanese activities at his school, and was reportedly a supporter of Sun Yat-sen. By early 1939 he had embraced Communism. He planned to go to Yan'an, the renowned communist base in China, but was persuaded to remain in Malaya and take on heavier responsibilities in the newly formed Malayan Communist Party. In late 1939, when Chin Peng was at 4th year of his Secondary school education (known as Senior Middle Level One), his school announced that the Senior Middle section was to be closed due to lack of funds. He decided to continue his education in the Methodist-run Anglo-Chinese Continuation School, which operated in English, because it provided a good cover for his underground activities. He did not want to have to move to Singapore to continue with his education in Chinese. He left the school \\"for fear of British harassment\\" after just 6 monthsChin and Hack, p. 39. He was now focused fully on his political activities and became, from that point on, a full-time revolutionary. In January 1940 he was put in charge of three anti-Japanese organisations that were targeting students, teachers, members of cultural activities and general labourers. At the end of January 1940 he was admitted to the Malayan Communist Party as a member. Chin and Hack, p. 41. Harassment by the authorities led him to leave his home town for Kuala Kangsar in July 1940. (This may be at the time when he left his school, refer to above). Later he spent a month in Taiping. In September 1940 the party posted him to Ipoh as a Standing committee member for Perak. In December he attained full Party membership. In early 1941 AEBUS was dissolved. Chin Peng became Ipoh District committee member of the Party. \\"He led student underground cells of three Chinese secondary schools and the Party's organisations of the shop assistants, domestic servants of European families, workers at brick kilns and barbers.\\" In June 1941 he became a member of the Perak State Committee. = Rise to prominence = Chin Peng rose to prominence during World War II when many Chinese Malayans took to the jungle to fight a guerrilla war against the Japanese. These fighters, inspired by the example of the Communist Party of China, became known as the Malayan People's Anti-Japanese Army (MPAJA). Chin Peng became the liaison officer between the MPAJA and the British military in South-East Asia. The Japanese invasion of Malaya began in December 1941. In 1942 Chin was the youngest of three members of the Secretariat of the Perak State Committee: Su Yew Meng was secretary and Chang Meng Ching (hanyu pinyin: Zhang Ming Jin) was the other member. In early 1943 the two senior members were captured by the Japanese, which left Chin Peng in charge. Contact with the Party's Central Committee had been lost; he attempted to re-establish it, travelling to Kuala Lumpur and meeting Chai Ker Meng. Later Lai Tek, the Party leader, sent another Central Committee member, Lee Siow Peng (Siao Ping), to replace Chin as State Secretary. However, Lee Siow Peng was captured not long after, while travelling to a meeting that was to be held in Singapore. Thus the job of establishing contact with the British commando Force 136 fell to Chin Peng. The first party of that force, consisting of Capt. John Davis and five Chinese agents, had landed in Malaya on 24 May 1943, by submarine. Chin Peng made contact with this armed group on 30 September 1943. He was active in his support for the British stay-behind troops, but had no illusions about their failure to protect Malaya against the Japanese. In the course of this activity, he came into contact with Freddie Spencer Chapman, who called him a 'true friend' in his Malayan jungle memoir, 'The Jungle Is Neutral'. Because of his services during the war, Chin was awarded an OBE (though it was subsequently withdrawn later by the British government), a mention in despatches and two campaign medals by Britain. He was elected the Secretary General of the Communist Party of Malaya after the betrayal of previous leader Lai Tek who turned out to be an agent for both the British and the Japanese and had denounced the leadership of the Party to the Japanese secret police. Chin Peng was the most senior surviving member. = Before the Emergency = In 1948, the Federation of Malaya Plan replaced the Malayan Union plan, frustrating the CPM as they felt the plan was undemocratic and biased towards the Malay elites. They accused the British for forcing the Federation idea on the people by portraying it as a constitutional solution to Malaya's crisis.Ng, p. 11Chin, p.201 According to Chin, the central committee still adhered to Lai Teck's peace struggle strategy in facing the Federation, as they thought that the people of Malaya were still recovering from the horrors of the Japanese Occupation. To launch an armed rebellion so soon would not only cause them to lose the mass support they had been enjoying but, at the same time, also drive the already wary Malays to openly resist them.Ng, p. 78Chin and Hack, p. 118Chin, p.193 Some scholars allege that the CPM received secret directives from Moscow agents on the methods and timing for a near- simultaneous uprising against colonial authorities during the Southeast Asian Youth Conference held in Calcutta on 19 February 1948 which eventually caused the CPM's insurrection. Chin denied it, stating that the conference actually argued against such a move. Laurence Sharkey, party secretary of the Australian Communist Party, informed Chin and the central committee of the conference's decision while stopping over in Singapore on his way home.Ng, p. 79Chin, p. 202 In March 1948, the central committees were discussing new policies as the labour strikes were not bringing the results that they hoped for. Chin Peng estimated it would be a year or two before the British took actions against the CPM, leaving them ample time to prepare for a guerrilla war.Ng, p. 80Chin, p. 205 On 12 June 1948, the colonial government outlawed the burgeoning trade union federations amid a rising atmosphere of tension. Since then, there was no reduction in the level of violent activities, other than the neutralisation of trade unions. Political murders of informers, anyone found to be working against the labour movement or the CPM, non- Europeans considered enemies to the communist cause, or strike-breakers who used thugs and gangsters to harass protesters rose.Ng, p. 81 The murder of three Kuomintang leaders in Johor on 12 June had convinced the British that the communists were escalating the conflict in retaliation for outlawing the trade unions, while in the CPM's eyes these murders were just purely acts of intimidation. Chin again claimed that he was not aware of the murders at the time, although he approved of the later killing of the plantation managers who he claimed were harsh and cruel towards farm workers.Chin, p. 215 = The Emergency (1948‚Äì1989) = Headline on page 1 of The Straits Times of On 16 June 1948, three European plantation managers were murdered in Sungai Siput, which has generally been identified as the incident contributing to the Malayan colonial administration declaration of a state of emergency. Rather, Sze-Chieh Ng argued these murders were merely the final catalyst for a long- brewing crisis that had been going on since the trade unions began agitating in 1945. Anthony Short feels that this was more of a panic reaction than a carefully considered move. According to him, the government had been powerless to deal with the unrest plaguing Malaya since 1945. According to Purcell's viewpoint, the Emergency was declared in response to increasing incidents of violence and lawlessness.Ng, p. 82Short, p. 75Purcell, p. 61 Many Singaporean historians and anti-communists allege that Chin Peng ordered the killings. Chin claimed he had no prior knowledge of the plot. He added that he barely escaped arrest, losing his passport in the process, and he lost touch with the Party for a couple of days.Chin Peng, My Side of History, pp 215‚Äì222. Chin became the most wanted man of the British government, with the government offering a reward of $250,000 for his capture. On 17 July 1948, CPM offices in Kuala Lumpur, Ipoh, Singapore, and other major cities were raided, followed by mass arrests of suspected communists and anti-government individuals on 21 July.Ng, p. 83 The CPM was banned in July 1948. In response to the Emergency and the mass arrests of its members, the CPM issued a call to its members to revive its disbanded wartime resistance army, the MPAJA, take up arms again and escape to the jungles.Cheah, p. 135 In fact, since late May and early June the communists had been secretly setting up platoons in several states in preparation for an expected British crackdown in September. The Emergency's sudden declaration in June, however, forced the MCP to accelerate its plan and it called out to comrades and volunteers to join them in the struggle. The new guerrilla army, now known as the Malayan National Liberation Army (MNLA), spent the first year of the Emergency reconsolidating and rearming. At that time, the CPM was in chaos, which the members were dispersed in the jungles, and operating without a command structure and a central leadership. According to Chin, attacks were being carried out without his approval or knowledge and there was no co-ordination between the units. Guerrilla casualties were high in return for little to no strategic gains in those early months.Chin, p. 226 Chin was desperate to assert control over the MNLA, which had been operating independently since June. It was not until August that some form of central authority was finally set up in the Cameron Highlands, with Chin ordering the guerrillas to adopt Mao Zedong's strategy of establishing liberated zones as they drove the British from an area.Chin,p. 230 However, this strategy failed. British forces continued to hound the guerrillas, who were often forced to relocate deeper into the jungles and disperse their forces into smaller units. This was due to difficulties in resupply and the dangers of maintaining a large force, where the chances of discovery and annihilation by British patrols were high.Ng, p. 84 Furthermore, the CPM was losing civilian support, and lacking material assistance and intelligence, the party suffered. Chin admitted they had wrongly assumed that the people would be willing to offer their support as they had in World War II. When that failed to happen, they resorted to forceful measures to obtain what they needed.Chin, p. 273 The CPM and MNLA also suffered under British propaganda, which labelled them as bandits and communist terrorists. Old suspicions and assumptions that the CPM had clandestine support from either the CCP or the Soviet Union had, over time, became an accepted fact.Ng, p. 85 Post-Cold War materials have finally overturned the convenient lie the British promoted more than half a century ago, revealing not only that the CPM had not sought external support but also that no agents from either China or Russia had even made contact with them. The only ‚Äòsupport‚Äô Chin recalled obtaining was the encouraging news that Mao's guerrillas had defeated Chiang Kai-shek's well-equipped and numerically superior KMT army in 1949.Ng, p. 86Chin, p. 356 Briggs Plan In 1950, a series of strategies were introduced by the Director of Operations for the anti- communist war in Malaya, Lt. General Sir Harold Briggs, that later became known as ‚ÄòBriggs' Plan.‚ÄôNg, p. 87 The plan, which aimed to defeat the guerrillas by cutting off their sources of civilian support, was a success. The creation of ‚ÄòNew Villages‚Äô under this plan had limited intelligence and food supplies for the CPM, and thus had a devastating effect on the guerrillas.Ng, p. 88 Chin concurred this fact, as he nearly starved on several occasions during those twelve years.Chin, p. 395 After several reviews and amendments, the CPM ordered the guerrillas to cease sabotage and terror operations, and to develop closer ties with the middle-class in order to preserve their organizational strength. Chin would later admit in an interview in 1999 that this directive was a mistake as it allowed the British to press on with their attacks on the MNLA, whom they correctly assessed to be quite demoralised by then.Chin and Hack, p. 160 After Sir Harold Briggs died, Lt. General Sir Gerald Templer was appointed as the new commander, introducing aggressive strategies which differed from the Briggs Plan. These included interrogations, food rationing, large monetary rewards for captured or killed communists coupled with intense military operations, and the mobilisation of a large number of troops to hound the guerrillas.Short, p. 365Chin, p. 299 In 1953, the CPM relocated their headquarters to Betong, in southern Thailand. They reestablished its networks to connect the scattered units and review its strategy.Ng, p. 91Chin, p. 278 In late 1953 and early 1954, the war was at a semi-stalemate due to both the MNLA and the British being unable to decisively defeat one another.Ng, p. 92 In early 1954, Siao Chang, a top CPM leader who had been sent to Beijing in late 1952 to deepen his Marxist‚ÄìLeninist education while also serving as liaison to the CCP, announced a new direction for the party, which was to abandon the establishment of the People's Democratic Republic of Malaya and join with other Malayan political parties in a legal fight for Malaya independence.Ng, p. 93 Chin described Siao as the CPM's ‚Äòinsurance policy‚Äô in the event the central committee was eliminated.Chin, p. 351 Although this was not their decision, Chin and the other central committees decided to join the other Malayan parties, reasoning that the Malay politicians had achieved more for the independence movement within the last few years than the MNLA had since 1948. The Beijing announcement also revealed to the CPM that both the Soviet Union and the People's Republic of China had viewed the armed struggle in Malaya as untenable.Ng, p. 94Chin and Hack, p. 164 Baling Talks On 24 September 1955, Chin wrote to Tunku Abdul Rahman offering to negotiate peace. On 17 October, talks between two government representatives and Chin Peng and another central committee of the CPM were held at Klian Intan.O'Ballance, p. 152 A new ‚ÄòEight Point Program‚Äô was introduced by the CPM to call for an end to the Emergency and a cessation of hostilities, a reform of Malaya's political system, expand democratic rights, support for world peace, and attention to other matters including education, health, welfare, and industrial production. On 28 and 29 December 1955, the negotiations reached its peak at the small northern town of Baling in Kedah. Representatives from the Government were Tunku Abdul Rahman, David Marshall, the Chief Minister of Singapore, and Sir Cheng Lock Tan, the leader of the Malayan Chinese Association (MCA). The CPM was represented by Chin Peng, Chen Tian, and Abdul Rashid bin Maidin. The first day of the talks did not go well, as Chin wanted the CPM to be recognised as a legal party again, or for the leaders and members of the MNLA to at least be allowed to regain their freedom of movement and not face any legal persecution or imprisonment.Ng, p. 97 Tunku Abdul Rahman rejected this request, and demanded at the beginning of the meeting that the CPM fully surrender as the only way to peace, but then promised that those who surrendered would undergo a period of rehabilitation before being allowed to become free citizens again. Chin again argued freedom of thought and choice must be recognised by the Malayan government if the new nation was to survive past its independence, as the people should have the right to decide which political path the nation should take rather than having that choice be decided by a select few in the government. Tunku Abdul Rahman rejected this as well, and only promised freedom for the CPM members to join any existing political party after being cleared by the authorities. On the second day of talks, Chin asserted that the CPM would cease its hostilities and lay down its arms if the Alliance government could obtain the powers of internal security and defence from the British government.Cheah, p. 141 Tunku Abdul Rahman accepted it as a challenge and promised that he would push for it on his upcoming trip to London.Ng, p. 98 Great publicity was given in the media to this dramatic challenge from Chin Peng. The challenge, indeed, served to strengthen the Alliance government's bargaining position at the London talks. Anxious to end the Emergency, the British government agreed to concede those powers of internal security and defence, and to accede to the demand for independence for Malaya by 31 August 1957, if possible.Cheah, p. 142 Chin claimed it was his challenge to Tunku Abdul Rahman that hastened the independence of Malaya. Tunku Abdul Rahman had acknowledged the importance of the Baling talks, writing in 1974 that ‚ÄòBaling had led straight to Merdeka (Independence).‚Äô Regardless, the talks themselves ended without a consensus between the two sides. The talks finally collapsed but were regarded as both a success and failure for Tunku Abdul Rahman, as the talks made the British regard him as a strong leader who was tough on communism. His performance had also impressed the Colonial Office enough to grant Malaya independence. For the CPM, it was a very demoralising affair which nearly destroyed their already ailing struggle. The failure of the Baling Talks had a great negative impact towards the CPM, accumulated with the lost of hope to either end the war or achieve the advancement of their ideology. Due to the mounting combat casualties plus the lack of stable food supplies, the members started to turn themselves in to the government in return for financial rewards and pardons.Ng, p. 99 In 1956, Chin wrote to Tunku Abdul Rahman offering to resume negotiations. This was rejected by Rahman in a broadcast on 2 April. The MNLA would lose almost 88% of its men, from an approximately 3000-strong army when they first raised arms in mid-1948 to no more than 350 men by late 1958 due to casualties and surrenders.Ng, p. 100Short, p. 493Chin, p. 403 In 1959, the central committees of CPM decided to demobilise their activities and to have the guerrillas reintegrate into society while continuing to promote their communist ideals until such a time when they could once again rise up in revolt. Chin then moved to south Thailand with the remnants of his forces during the latter part of the Emergency due to pressure from the Malayan security forces, which by 1952 totalled over 32,000 regular troops in Malaya, about three-fifths of whom were Europeans from the United Kingdom, New Zealand and Australia.Cheah, p. 137 The Second Insurgency (1968-1989) In 1961, members of the CPM central committee such as Chin Peng, Chen Tien, and Lee An Tung moved to Beijing to seek political advice and guidance from the more experienced Chinese Communist Party. Chin would, however, remain in Beijing for the next 29 years and the party would not lay down its arms until 1989. The reasons for this reversal of the party's decision to disband, according to Chin, was the advice given to him by the Vietnamese communist leaders in Hanoi, the opening of the second ‚ÄòVietnam War‚Äô, which was followed by China's Cultural Revolution, all of which stressed a strong militant line to be taken by Asian communist parties.Cheah, p. 143 While in Beijing, Chin Peng was also advised by Deng Xiaoping, to continue the armed struggle in Malaya as Deng felt the time was ripe for revolutions to take place in Southeast Asia.Ng, p. 101 Deng insisted that the military struggle should not only be maintained but stepped up.Taaffe, 2005 Deng even promised financial support to the CPM if they should take up arms once again. Deng's offer was to remain a secret as the CCP did not wish to let it be known that they had been actively supporting Southeast Asia's communist movements. Chin reluctantly decided to acquiesce to Deng's suggestion. This was also the first time that the CPM had accepted foreign assistance in its struggle and it was with this financial backing that the second armed struggle in Malaya would be launched in 1968. Meanwhile, back in Malaya, the Malayan government had declared the Emergency over on 31 July 1960 once they became confident the MNLA had ceased to be a credible threat, with the surviving guerrillas retreating to their sanctuary in southern Thailand. However, the insurgency continued with the insurgents increasing their attacks, ambushing military convoys, bombing national monuments, and assassinations of marked police officers and political ‚Äòenemy targets‚Äô. The insurgency, which began as a war against the British colonialists, was now transformed into a war against ‚Äòfederalists, compressors capitalists and lackeys of British imperialism‚Äô. The Malayan government maintained a high security alert by devoting one-third of its national budget to defence and internal security needs, and requested British, Australian and New Zealand troops to remain in the country until its internal security and national armed forces could be built up and the foreign troops gradually phased out. In 1970, the CPM's guerrilla bases in Thailand were hard hit by the trials and executions of supposed spies. Two breakaway factions were formed which condemned the purge. Chin, who was then based in China, denied involvement and later rehabilitated his accused comrades.Chin, p. 466-469, 499 During the 1970s and 1980s, the CPM intensified its activities and clashes with the security forces. These activities were due to a rivalry among three factions in the CPM over party purges and strategies, with each faction trying to outdo the other in militancy and violence.Cheah, p. 148 However, in 1980, Deng Xiaoping refocused his priorities back on the Chinese bureaucracy after his return to power in 1978. He welcomed Lee Kuan Yew, the then-Prime Minister of Singapore and its leading political figure since independence from Malaysia, in a visit to Beijing. Chin recalled that Deng had not bothered to meet him since then. Finally in December 1980, Deng summoned Chin. In the meeting, Deng demanded Chin to immediately close down all the CPM's radio stations which were broadcasting from China to Malaysia. When Chin asked Deng when he would like him to cease the broadcasting, Deng replied, ‚ÄúThe sooner the better... Lee (Lee Kuan Yew) asked me to stop the broadcasts immediately.‚Äù Moreover, during his official visit to China, the second Prime Minister of Malaysian government Tun Razak held talks with Chinese communist leader Chairman Mao Zedong and urged him to stop giving aid to the CPM. The fourth Prime Minister Dr Mahathir Mohammad further succeeded in persuading China to downgrade its ties with the CPM. This was an important factor that contributed to the CPM's decision to end its armed struggle.Chin, p. 482-483 The End of the Emergency The CPM finally laid down its arms in 1989. The death toll during the armed conflict totalled thousands. Those sympathetic to Chin Peng tend to portray the violence perpetrated by the CPM as defensive, while right-wing opponents tend to portray it as aggressive and unethical. Some have claimed the large number of civilian casualties was in contrast to the stance adopted by Mao Zedong and his policy of the Eight Points of Attention. On 2 December 1989, at the town of Hat Yai in Southern Thailand, Chin, Rashid Maidin and Abdullah CD met with representatives of the Malaysian and Thai governments. Separate peace agreements were signed between the MCP and both governments. One of the terms of the agreement was that MCP members of Malayan origin be allowed to return to live in Malaysia. When all hostilities ceased, the total number of CPM members was 1,188; 694 were Thai-born and 494 claimed origins in Peninsular Malaysia. They were given a temporary grant and promised integration into Malaysia. In Chin's opinion, a peace could have been achieved as early as 1955 during the Baling Talks, if the British, Tunku Abdul Rahman and David Marshall had not demanded that the communist fighters capitulate and surrender but, rather, had allowed them to hand over or destroy their weapons in a mutually agreed way and then resume normal life with full political freedom, which was the broad outcome of the 1989 accords.Symon, 2003 = Application to return to Malaysia = Chin never officially returned to Malaysia after the 1989 Hat Yai Peace Accords, but continued his exile in Thailand. He gave lectures at the National University of Singapore in 2004, using purposes of academic research as his reason to gain the visitation permission from the Singaporean government. At the beginning of 2000, he applied for permission to return to Malaysia. His application was rejected by the High Court on 25 July 2005. In June 2008, Chin again lost his bid to return to Malaysia when the Court of Appeal upheld an earlier ruling that compelled him to show identification papers to prove his citizenship. Chin maintained that his birth certificate was seized by the police during a raid in 1948. His counsel Raja Aziz Addruse had submitted before the Court of Appeal that it was wrong for the Malaysian government to compel him to produce the documents, because he was entitled to enter and live in Malaysia by virtue of the peace agreement. On April 2009, Chin's application to return to Malaysia was once again rejected by the High Court for the same reason as his previous attempt. The Malaysian government insisted that his possible return would cause people who lost their loved ones during the Emergency to relive their pain again.\\"Former CPM General Secretary Chen Ping Died in Thailand\\" In November 2009, Chin issued an apology to the victims and their family members for the atrocities committed by the CPM.\\"Chin Peng apologies on behalf of CPM\\" However, the then-Deputy Prime Minister of Malaysia, Muhyiddin Yassin, replied that despite Chin's apology, he would still not be allowed to return to Malaysia due to his treason.‚ÄúMuhyidin: Government will not change the decision, Chin Peng can't return even if he apologized‚Äù = Death = Prior to his death, he lived in exile in Thailand. Contrary to one of the conditions of the 1989 peace agreement, he was not permitted to return to Malaysia. Chin died at the age of 88 in a Bangkok hospital on the morning of 16 September 2013, the 50th anniversary of Malaysia Day,\\"CPM General Secretary Chen Ping Died\\" and the 90th birthday of Lee Kuan Yew. He was cremated according to Buddhist rites. While Chin had previously voiced wishes to be buried in Sitiawan, his remains continued to be denied entry for burial in Malaysia by the Malaysian government, as it was claimed that the one-year window after the agreement to reapply for citizenship had long lapsed and Chin was assumed to have relinquished his rights to return. Eventually, in September of 2019, his ashes were returned by a small action committee, who scattered his ashes at the small town of Chemor and at sea. https://www.thestar.com.my/news/nation/2019/11/26/chin-peng039s-ashes-brought- back-to-malaysia-in-september  Publications  Chin Peng co-authored his story with Singapore-based writers and publishers Ian Ward, who was formerly the Southeast Asia correspondent for the London conservative newspaper, The Daily Telegraph, and Ward's wife Norma Miraflor. The book named ‚ÄúAlias Chin Peng: My Side of History‚Äù, was published in 2003.\\"An intriguing enigma to the end\\" Another book, ‚ÄúDialogues with Chin Peng: New Light on the Malayan Communist Party‚Äù by editors C.

This book details a series of meetings held in Australia that Chin Peng had attended with historians and military experts.  Media portrayal  In 2006, a documentary film about Chin Peng was made called The Last Communist. It was banned by the Ministry of Home Affairs of Malaysia. Another documentary film about him called I Love Malaya was released.

Note that the radius bar is set to reverse. The Walschaerts valve gear is a type of valve gear invented by Belgian railway mechanical engineer Egide Walschaerts in 1844 used to regulate the flow of steam to the pistons in steam engines. The gear is sometimes named without the final \\"s\\", since it was incorrectly patented under that name. It was extensively used in steam locomotives from the late 19th century until the end of the steam era. History Swindon Marlborough & Andover Railway Single Fairlie 0-4-4T of 1878. This was the first British locomotive to be fitted with Walschaerts valve gear The Walschaerts valve gear was slow to gain popularity. The Stephenson valve gear remained the most commonly used valve gear on 19th- century locomotives. However, the Walschaerts valve gear had the advantage that it could be mounted entirely on the outside of the locomotives, leaving the space between the frames clear and allowing easy access for service and adjustment; which resulted in it being adopted in some articulated locomotives. The first locomotive fitted with the Walschaerts valve gear was built at the Belgian Tubize workshops, and was awarded a gold medal at the 1873 Universal Exhibition in Vienna. In 1874 New Zealand Railways ordered two NZR B class locomotives. They were Double Fairlie locomotives, supplied by Avonside; the first use in New Zealand of Walschaerts valve gear and probably the first time that a British manufacturer had supplied it. They were Cape gauge. The Mason Bogie, a modified Fairlie locomotive of 1874, was the first to use the Walschaerts gear in North America. The first application in Britain was on a Single Fairlie 0-4-4T, exhibited in Paris in 1878 and purchased by the Swindon, Marlborough and Andover Railway in March 1882. According to Ahrons,E.L. Ahrons, \\"Locomotive and Train working in the latter part of the 19th Century\\" (Cambridge, UK: Heffer, 1953), Vol. 4 P 122 the locomotive saw very little service as nobody seems to have known how to set the valves and this led to enormous coal consumption. In the 20th century, the Walschaerts valve gear was the most commonly used type, especially on larger locomotives. In Europe, its use was almost universal, whilst in North America, the Walschaerts gear outnumbered its closest competitor, the derived Baker valve gear, by a wide margin. In Germany and some neighbouring countries, like Poland and Czechoslovakia, the Walschaerts gear is generally named the Heusinger valve gear after Edmund Heusinger von Waldegg, who invented the mechanism independently in 1849. Heusinger's gear was closer to the form generally adopted, but most authorities accept Walschaerts' invention as sufficiently close to the final form. Purpose The Walschaerts valve gear is an improvement on the earlier Stephenson valve gear in that it enables the driver to operate the steam engine in a continuous range of settings from maximum economy to maximum power. At any setting, the valve gear satisfies the following two conditions: * The valve opens to admit steam to the cylinder just before the start of a piston stroke. The pressure of this steam provides the driving force. * Soon before the space on one side of the piston starts to contract, the valve starts to release steam from that space to the atmosphere, so as not to impede the movement of the piston. In an economical setting, steam is admitted to the expanding space for only part of the stroke; at a point set by the driver, the intake is cut off. Since the exhaust is also shut, during the rest of the stroke the steam that has entered the cylinder expands in isolation, and so its pressure decreases. Thus, the most energy available from the steam (in the absence of a condenser) is used. The Walschaerts valve gear enables the engine driver to change the cutoff point without changing the points at which intake starts. Economy also requires that the throttle be wide open and that the boiler pressure is at the maximum safe level to maximise thermal efficiency. For economy, a steam engine is used of a size such that the most economical settings yield the right amount of power most of the time, such as when a train is running at steady speed on level track. When greater power is necessary, e.g. when gaining speed when pulling out of a station and when ascending a gradient, the Walschaerts valve gear enables the engine driver to set the cutoff point near the end of the stroke, so that the full pressure of the boiler is exerted on the piston for almost the entire stroke. With such a setting, when the exhaust opens, the steam in the cylinder is near full boiler pressure. The pressure in the steam at that moment serves no useful purpose; it drives a sudden pulse of pressure into the atmosphere and is wasted . This sudden pulse of pressure causes the loud ‚Äúchoo‚Äù sound that members of the public associate with steam engines, because they mostly encounter engines at stations, where efficiency is sacrificed as trains pull away. A steam engine well adjusted for efficiency makes a soft ‚ÄúhhHHhh‚Äù sound that lasts throughout the exhaust stroke, with the sounds from the two cylinders overlapping to produce a nearly constant sound. Motion The valve gear operation combines two motions; one is the primary lead motion which is imparted at the bottom of the combination lever (12). The secondary is the directional/amplitude motion which is imparted at the top. Consider that the driver has adjusted the reversing lever such that the die block is at mid-gear. In this position the secondary motion is eliminated and the piston valve travel is shortest, giving minimal injection and exhaust of steam. The travel of the piston valve is twice the total of lap plus lead. Contrast this to when the die block is at the bottom of the expansion link (7), giving maximum steam injection and exhaust. This is the most powerful forward setting and is used in accelerating forward from rest. Conversely when the die block is at the top of the expansion link (7), maximal power in reverse is obtained. (On some engines the die block was in the top of the link in forward gear. This type was generally used on tank engines, which worked in forward and reverse equally.\\"Locomotive Valve Gears and Valve Setting\\" (London, UK: Locomotive Publishing Co.,1924), p 67) Once the locomotive has accelerated the driver can adjust the reverser toward the mid-gear position, decreasing cut- off to give a more economical use of steam. The engine's tractive effort is then less than it was at starting, but its power is greater. Technical details framecenterThe key components of Walschaerts Valve Gear: The primary lead motion is provided by the crosshead arm (9) and the union link (11). This pivoting bar gives the in phase component of motion to the bottom of the combination lever (12). The secondary directional/amplitude motion is derived from a mechanical linkage made up of several components. The eccentric crank (UK: return crank) (1) is rigidly attached to the con-rod pin connected to the main drive wheel. Note that this is the only suitable attachment point on any of the drive wheels that is not fouled by the passage of the coupling rod or the connecting rod. The eccentric crank is of a length such that the pin attachment to the eccentric rod (2) is 90 degrees out of phase with the lead motion. The eccentric rod provides motion to the expansion link (7) which is pivoted in a central location back to the body of the locomotive. The expansion link holds the radius bar (8), captive by a die block which is integral with the radius bar but is free to move vertically in a constrained curved path along the expansion link. The vertical position of the radius bar is controlled in the cab by the driver adjusting the reverser which in turn controls the mechanical linkage; reach rod (3), lifting link (4), lifting arm (5) and reverse arm and shaft (6). In this way the secondary, out of phase, driver controlled component of motion is imparted to the top of the combination lever (12) by the radius bar (8). The combination lever combines these two motions with the resultant acting upon the valve stem (13), suitably restrained by the valve stem guide (10), which in turn acts upon the piston valve (14). =Inside and outside admission valves= The Walschaerts gear can be linked to inside or outside admission valves. This article has only considered inside-admission piston valves until now, but outside-admission valves (slide valves and some piston valves) can use Walschaerts valve gear. If the valves have outside admission the radius bar connects to the combination lever below the valve stem rather than above. =Layout= The Walschaerts valve gear on a Pennsylvania Railroad E6s To lay out the Walschaerts gear, the proportions of the combination lever must be chosen. The total movement of the valve rod in mid gear should be symmetric between front and back dead centre. A displacement of the union link end by half the piston travel must cause a valve rod displacement of the valve lead plus the valve lap. The ratio of distance from union link end to pivot with radius rod to the distance between the valve rod end to the pivot with the radius rod should be in the same proportion as half piston travel to valve lap plus lead. Next, the fact that in midgear the valve opening should be the same for the piston in both front and rear dead centre positions is used to find the mid gear position of the pivot between the combination rod and reach rod. In practice the valve spindle length is adjusted to ensure this as part of setting the timing. Also the dimensions of the lead and lap lever are set so that the valve moves twice the lead + lap of the valve. With the reverser in mid gear position since there should be no superimposed return crank motion, the expansion link die slot should be an arc of a circle centred on the pivot in mid gear and of radius equal to the length of the radius rod. This condition precludes adjustment of the valve gear by altering the length of the radius rod. The throw of the return crank must now be determined; The actual throw required from the crank is determined from the dimensions of the expansion link.

Critique of Middle Eastern studies  Kramer is a critic of Middle Eastern studies programs in the United States which he thinks are left- wing and backed with poor scholarship. = Ivory Towers on Sand = In 2001, the Washington Institute for Near East Policy published Kramer's book Ivory Towers on Sand: The Failure of Middle Eastern Studies in America.download In the book (as reported by the New York Times), Kramer argued that Middle East experts \\"failed to ask the right questions at the right time about Islam. They underestimated its impact in the 1980s; they misrepresented its role in the early 1990s; and they glossed over its growing potential for terrorism against America in the late 1990s.\\" The book was harshly criticized by scholars of Islam an Middle Eastern studies. John L. Esposito, a leading American scholar of Islam and the founder of the Center for Muslim-Christian Understanding at Georgetown University, accused Kramer of trying to discredit the entire Middle East establishment. Zachary Lockman, professor of modern Middle East history at New York University, admits that Kramer's criticism of Middle East scholars general failure to anticipate the rise of Islamist movements in the 1970s is well-deserved but maintains that \\"[o]verall, Kramer‚Äôs approach is deeply flawed as a history of Middle East studies as a scholarly field.\\" = HR 3077 = Kramer was one of the most vocal supporters of HR 3077,, a bill in the United States House of Representatives designed to reform area studies in the US.

Deans at Harvard University's Weatherhead Center for International Affairs rejected these calls, stating, \\"Accusations have been made that Martin Kramer's statements are genocidal.

Background  Thracian helmet with decorations made from bronze and silver. Dated mid-4th century BC. The Getae had been federated in the Odrysian kingdom in the 5th century BC. It is not known how the relations between Getae and Odrysians developed. The Balkan campaigns of Philip II of Macedon between 352 and 340 BC shattered Odrysian authority and the Getae profited from the situation. By the second half of the 4th century, the Getae occupied sites on both banks of the lower Danube and this region flourished as never before. The new Macedonian conquests, secured with considerable military power, caused consternation in the adjoining territories and thus stimulated the political fusion of the Getic tribes.  Name  There is no consensus on the etymology of the name ŒîœÅŒøŒºŒπœáŒ±ŒØœÑŒ∑œÇ (Dromichaites). It can be a Greek name (Œ¥œÅœåŒºŒøœÇ \\"run\\" + œáŒ±ŒπœÑŒÆŒµŒπœÇ \\"long-haired\\"), a Thracian name, or a Thracian name formed with Greek elements (ŒîœÅŒøŒºŒø- and ŒßŒ±ŒπœÑŒø-, -œáŒ±ŒπœÑŒ∑œÇ). Other people with this name include: * a Thracian mercenary soldier in Attica around 300 BC * a Thracian chief helping Antiochus II Theos (261 ‚Äì 246 BC) at the siege of Kypsela * a general of Mithridates VI Eupator sent with reinforcements in 87 BC to support Archelaus in Athens  Reign  Not much is known about the reign of Dromichaetes, his court and his kingdom. The most detailed account is provided by two fragments from the history of Diodorus Siculus. But this source must be treated with caution, as the interference of literary motifs lessens its value as historical evidence. = Helis = Pictorial reconstruction of the fortified settlement discovered at Pope≈üti in southern Romania. According to Diodorus, the main residence of Dromichaetes was named Helis. Traditionally, Helis and the kingdom of Dromichaetes have been placed beyond the Danube, in the Romanian Plain. Thus Helis was variously located at Piscul CrƒÉsani on Ialomi»õa River, at Pope≈üti on Arge≈ü River, at Zimnicea on the left bank of Danube, or identified with one of the several earth-walled fortifications from the Alexandria-Ro≈üiorii de Vede complex. It was also suggested Helis was located in the Moldavian Plateau in a cluster of fortified settlements dated to between the 6th and the 3rd century BC, where two royal treasures were also found at Cucuteni BƒÉiceni and St√¢nce≈üti. The Getic tomb at Sveshtari (discovered in 1982) in the western Ludogorie in Bulgaria is also supposed to have been near the location of Helis. In the vicinity of the mausoleum, the remains of a large ancient city were found along with dozens of Getic mound tombs. The settlement is situated in a natural stronghold, a plateau surrounded like a peninsula by the ravines of Krapinets River. The outer stone wall, up to 4m thick, follows the edges of the peninsula and defends a territory of about 10 hectares. The inner wall, of similar construction, encloses a roughly quadrilateral area of about 5 hectares. The fortified territory was relatively densely occupied by dwellings connected by a network of thoroughfares. Dating finds such as amphorae stamps and coins indicate that this settlement existed between c. 335 and c. 250 BC. The settlement enjoyed economic prosperity and sustained active trade relations with the Greek colonies in the Aegean and the Black Sea region. Imported goods were found in abundance: Attic black-glazed ceramics, amphorae from Thassos, Sinope and Heraclea Pontica and pottery of probably West-Pontic colonial origin. It was also an important production centre with metalworking, bone and pottery workshops.  The war with Lysimachus  Coin of Lysimachus. In 313 BC, during the Third War of the Diadochi, the Greek colonies of the western Black Sea shores revolted against Lysimachus, a former general of Alexander the Great, and expelled the military garrisons imposed by him. Lysimachus besieged successively Odessus and Histria and forced them to capitulate. A peace treaty was drawn up in 311, but the siege of Callatis continued until 310 or 309 BC. No other action of Lysimachus is known north of Haemus until the clash with Dromichaetes in the 290s BC. The evidence for the conflict is incomplete and contradictory, although attested by a number of ancient authors. It was probably provoked by the territorial expansion of Lysimachus and the control of the Greek colonies was perhaps the issue at stake. The two fragments of Diodorus' history suggest two separate campaigns. During the first the Getae captured Agathocles, the son of Lysimachus, but later set him free hoping to recover the territories lost to Lysimachus. During the second Lysimachus himself was taken prisoner and then released under similar conditions. However Pausanias, mentioning the same two episodes, implies they are parallel versions of one and the same event. The campaign in which Lysimachus fell captive to the Getae is dated by scholars variously between 294 and 291 BC. Lysimachus invaded with significant forces and his offensive enjoyed some early success before ending in disaster. According to Polyaenus, Seuthes, a general of Dromichaetes, presented himself as a deserter, deceived Lysimachus and led him into difficult terrain. Attacked by Dromichaetes, the army of Lysimachus was defeated and the king had to surrender. Diodorus gives our only account of the captivity and subsequent release of Lysimachus. Dromichaetes succeeded in persuading the assembly of his compatriots that the release of the enemy king would bring them greater political advantage than his punishment. Dromichaetes also set out a feast to demonstrate the barbarian ways and the poverty of his people, using different furniture, tableware and food. He then asked Lysimachus: Dromichaetes crowned Lysimachus with a wreath and then set him free, after receiving promises of loyalty and friendship and the return of the Getic territories occupied by Lysimachus. As precaution, the Getae held some high-born hostages like Clearchus, the son of the tyrant Dionysius of Heraclea. Lysimachus also had to give his daughter in marriage to Dromichaetes. = Death and burial = The main burial chamber of the Thracian tomb of Sveshtari in northeast Bulgaria. The great tomb in Ginina mound near Sveshtari is among the most prominent Thracian tombs with its unique architecture and luxurious decoration. It is dated approximately to the early 3rd century BC. A painted scene, interpreted as either one of heroization or investiture, points to its probable royal character. The man and the woman buried here were tentatively identified with Dromichaetes and his consort. The unfinished details of its sculptured and painted decoration indicate a hasty and premature burial. The woman was probably murdered to accompany her royal husband in the grave. The Roman historian Justin mentions a large army of Celts defeating both Triballi and Getae before attacking Antigonus Gonatas in 279 BC. Based on this account, Peter Delev argued that Dromichaetes could have fallen in battle against these Celts.  Legacy  = Classical world = The captivity of Lysimachus was echoed in the Classical Greek literature as a moralizing story about the punishment of pride and the virtues of barbarians. Diodorus' story of Dromichaetes' banquet for his royal prisoner is probably a literary device, contrasting Macedonian opulence with Thracian frugality. = Modern world = Dromichaetes is the king of Dacians and the main character in Muntele (\\"The Mountain\\"), a play written in 1977 by Dumitru Radu Popescu and a political fable. The identity between the ruler and its people alludes to Ceau≈üescu's cult of personality. Helis Nunatak on Livingston Island in the South Shetland Islands, Antarctica is named after the Getic Helis.

One significant graveyard orbit is a supersynchronous orbit well above geosynchronous orbit. Some satellites are moved into such orbits at the end of their operational life to reduce the probability of colliding with operational spacecraft and generating space debris. Overview A graveyard orbit is used when the change in velocity required to perform a de-orbit maneuver is too large. De-orbiting a geostationary satellite requires a delta-v of about , whereas re-orbiting it to a graveyard orbit only requires about . For satellites in geostationary orbit and geosynchronous orbits, the graveyard orbit is a few hundred kilometers above the operational orbit. The transfer to a graveyard orbit above geostationary orbit requires the same amount of fuel as a satellite needs for about three months of stationkeeping. It also requires a reliable attitude control during the transfer maneuver. While most satellite operators plan to perform such a maneuver at the end of their satellites' operational lives, through 2005 only about one-third succeeded. However, as of 2011, most recently decommissioned geosynchronous spacecraft were said to have been moved to a graveyard orbit. According to the Inter-Agency Space Debris Coordination Committee (IADC) the minimum perigee altitude \\\\Delta{H} \\\\, above the geostationary orbit is: :\\\\Delta{H} = 235\\\\mbox{ km} + \\\\left ( 1000 C_R \\\\frac{A}{m} \\\\right )\\\\mbox{ km} where C_R \\\\, is the solar radiation pressure coefficient and \\\\frac{A}{m} \\\\, is the aspect area [m2] to mass [kg] ratio of the satellite. This formula includes about 200 km for the GEO-protected zone to also permit orbit maneuvers in GEO without interference with the graveyard orbit. Another of tolerance must be allowed for the effects of gravitational perturbations (primarily solar and lunar). The remaining part of the equation considers the effects of the solar radiation pressure, which depends on the physical parameters of the satellite. In order to obtain a license to provide telecommunications services in the United States, the Federal Communications Commission (FCC) requires all geostationary satellites launched after March 18, 2002, to commit to moving to a graveyard orbit at the end of their operational life. U.S. government regulations require a boost, \\\\Delta{H}, of about 300 km. A spacecraft moved to a graveyard orbit will typically be passivated. Uncontrolled objects in a near geostationary [Earth] orbit (GEO) exhibit a 53-year cycle of orbital inclination due to the interaction of the Earth's tilt with the lunar orbit. The orbital inclination varies ¬± 7.4¬∞, at up to 0.8¬∞pa.  Disposal orbit  While the standard geosynchronous satellite graveyard orbit results in an expected orbital lifetime of millions of years, the increasing number of satellites, the launch of microsatellites, and the FCC approval of large megaconstellations of thousands of satellites for launch by 2022 necessitates new approaches for deorbiting to assure earlier removal of the derelict objects once they have reached end-of-life. Contrary to GEO graveyard orbits requiring three months' worth of fuel, large satellite networks require orbits that passively decay into the Earth's atmosphere. For example, both OneWeb and SpaceX have committed to the FCC regulatory authorities that decommissioned satellites will decay to a lower orbit ‚Äî a disposal orbit‚Äîwhere the satellite orbital altitude would decay due to atmospheric drag and then naturally reenter the atmosphere and burn up within one year of end-of-life.

Biography Thompson was born in Markinch in Fife, Scotland. After emigrating with his family to the United States in 1865, Thompson lived near Pittsburgh, and later in Indiana County, PA, where he worked as a miner. He enlisted in the United States Army in September 1875, serving in the U.S. 7th Cavalry Regiment's C company from 1875 until 1880. His commanding officer was Capt. Thomas Custer. After an honorable discharge, he resided first in Lead, SD, where he worked at the Homestead Mine. Later he moved to Alzada, MT, where he became a rancher. He married Ruth Boicourt in 1904. They had two children, Susan and Peter Jr., born in 1906 and 1909. Thompson died on December 3, 1928, at Hot Springs, SD, of heart failure. He is buried West Lead Cemetery Lead, South Dakota. Little Big Horn In 1876, while serving under George Armstrong Custer in the eastern Montana Territory, he took part in the Battle of the Little Bighorn. Had his horse not given out on the bluffs above the river as the regiment reached the battlefield, Thompson would have died with Custer. As it was, Thompson and a companion named James Watson fell behind, but continued on toward the river. Unable to rejoin their own company, the two later climbed back up the bluffs and joined surviving elements of the regiment, under Major Marcus Reno. Thompson took part in other parts of the battle and was wounded in the hand and arm. In spite of his wounds, he made trips outside the lines to obtain water for the wounded, an act that gained him one of 24 Medals of Honor awarded for the battle. After the fight, he was evacuated to Fort Abraham Lincoln by steamboat. When his hand had recovered sufficiently, he wrote a lengthy account of the fighting. Notably, he said he had been in a hiding place from which he had seen Custer near the river, and had also witnessed the beginning of the fight in which Custer was killed. By implication, he may have been the last white man to have seen Custer alive. Controversy over Thompson's story Thompson was interviewed by the respected Indian Wars researcher Walter Mason Camp at the Little Bighorn Battlefield in 1909. Camp, who met with Thompson on other occasions and corresponded him for many years, was unable to reconcile Thompson's account with what he had learned from other participants and records. Thompson published his controversial 26,000 word account in his regional newspaper, the Belle Fourche, South Dakota Bee in the spring of 1914. This was an era when a number of old men (or deceased men, through their obituaries) claimed to have been \\"the last survivor\\" of Custer's Last Stand. Thompson would later have confrontations with other battle participants, and be accused of being a liar. He was so labeled by one veteran named William Slaper in a 1925 book, A Trooper with Custer, edited by Earl A. Brininstool. Thompson's attempts to prove his claims were frustrated by the unknown whereabouts of James Watson. Peter Thompson died in Hot Springs, South Dakota, and was interred in the West Lead Cemetery in Lead, South Dakota. Thompson's story has received significant attention in recent years. Daniel O. Magnussen wrote in 1974 that, while Thompson seemed to have been an honest man, his account was riddled with errors. He speculated that Thompson's memory may have been clouded by hallucinations brought on by stress and his wound. More recently, the publication of Camp's notes has again stimulated interest in Thompson's story, and provided corroboration for many controversial parts of the account. Like Curley's stories of the Little Bighorn, Thompson's account remains a fascinating enigma. Medal of Honor citation Rank and organization: Private, Company C, 7th U.S. Cavalry.

It is a colorless solid that arises from the reaction of glycolic acid and urea. It is an oxidized derivative of imidazolidine. In a more general sense, hydantoins can refer to a groups and a class of compounds with the same ring structure as the parent. For example, phenytoin (mentioned below) has two phenyl groups substituted onto the number 5 carbon in a hydantoin molecule. Synthesis Hydantoin was first isolated in 1861 by Adolf von Baeyer in the course of his study of uric acid. He obtained it by hydrogenation of allantoin, hence the name. :700px Friedrich Urech synthesized 5-methylhydantoin in 1873 from alanine sulfate and potassium cyanate in what is now known as the Urech hydantoin synthesis. The method is very similar to the modern route using alkyl and arylcyanates. The 5,5-dimethyl compound can also be obtained from acetone cyanohydrin (also discovered by Urech: see cyanohydrin reaction) and ammonium carbonate. This reaction type is called the Bucherer‚ÄìBergs reaction.Bergs, Ger. pat. 566,094 (1929) [C. A., 27, 1001 (1933)]. Hydantoin can also be synthesized either by heating allantoin with hydroiodic acid or by \\"heating bromacetyl urea with alcoholic ammonia\\". The cyclic structure of hydantoins was confirmed by Dorothy Hahn 1913. Of practical importance, hydantoins are obtained by condensation of a cyanohydrin with ammonium carbonate. Another useful route, which follows the work of Urech, involves the condensation of amino acids with cyanates and isocyanates: :420px Uses and occurrence =Pharmaceuticals= The hydantoin group can be found in several medicinally important compounds. In pharmaceuticals, hydantoin derivatives form a class of anticonvulsants; phenytoin and fosphenytoin both contain hydantoin moieties and are both used as anticonvulsants in the treatment of seizure disorders. The hydantoin derivative dantrolene is used as a muscle relaxant to treat malignant hyperthermia, neuroleptic malignant syndrome, spasticity, and ecstasy intoxication. Ropitoin is an example of an antiarrhythmic hydantoin. =Pesticides= The hydantoin derivative Imiprothrin is a pyrethroid insecticide. Iprodione is a popular fungicide containing the hydantoin group. 3-(3,5-dichlorophenyl)-hydantoin has the secret special code of S-7250. =Synthesis of amino acids= Hydrolysis of hydantoins affords amino acids: :RCHC(O)NHC(O)NH + H2O ‚Üí RCHC(NH2)CO2H + NH3 Hydantoin itself reacts with hot, dilute hydrochloric acid to give glycine. Methionine is produced industrially via the hydantoin obtained from methional. =Methylation= Methylation of hydantoin yields a variety of derivatives. Dimethylhydantoin (DMH) may refer to any dimethyl derivative of hydantoin, but especially 5,5-dimethylhydantoin. =Halogenation= Some N-halogenated derivatives of hydantoin are used as chlorinating or brominating agents in disinfectant/sanitizer or biocide products. The three major N-halogenated derivatives are dichlorodimethylhydantoin (DCDMH), bromochlorodimethylhydantoin (BCDMH), and dibromodimethylhydantoin (DBDMH). A mixed ethyl-methyl analogue, 1,3-dichloro-5-ethyl-5-methylimidazolidine-2,4-dione (bromochloroethylmethylhydantoin), is also used in mixtures with the above. Iprodione is a popular fungicide containing the hydantoin group. =DNA oxidation to hydantoins after cell death= A high proportion of cytosine and thymine bases in DNA are oxidized to hydantoins over time after the death of an organism. Such modifications block DNA polymerases and thus prevents PCR from working. Such damage is a problem when dealing with ancient DNA samples.

F. Benson, and also the name for two British television adaptations based on those novels. The novels The novels feature humorous incidents in the lives of (mainly) upper-middle-class British characters in the 1920s and 1930s, many of whom do not work for a living, who vie for social prestige and one-upmanship in an atmosphere of extreme cultural snobbery. Several of them are set in the small seaside town of Tilling, closely based on Rye, East Sussex, where Benson lived for a number of years and (like Lucia) served as mayor. Lucia previously lived at Riseholme, based on Broadway, Worcestershire, from where she brought to Tilling her celebrated recipe for Lobster √† la Riseholme. \\"Mallards\\", the home of Miss Mapp‚Äîand subsequently Lucia‚Äîwas based on Lamb House in Rye. The house had previously been the residence of Henry James and had a garden room overlooking the street. The novels, in chronological order, are: *Queen Lucia (1920) *Miss Mapp (1922) *Lucia in London (1927) *Mapp and Lucia (1931) *Lucia's Progress (1935) (published in the U.S. as The Worshipful Lucia) *Trouble for Lucia (1939) The first three books concern only the protagonist named in the title; the last three feature both Mapp and Lucia. In 1977 Thomas Y. Crowell Company reprinted all six novels in a compendium called Make Way for Lucia. The order of Miss Mapp and Lucia in London was switched in the compendium, and a Miss Mapp short story called \\"The Male Impersonator\\" was included between Miss Mapp and Mapp and Lucia. \\"Desirable Residences\\", one further short story featuring Miss Mapp, and previously having seen only one magazine printing in Benson's own time, was discovered by Jack Adrian in the 1990s and included in his collection of Benson stories, Desirable Residences.Benson, E. F.: Desirable Residences and Other Stories, Selected by Jack Adrian. Oxford University Press, 1991. . Reprinted from Good Housekeeping, February 1929. A slight oddity about this very short piece is that the town of Tilling was called Tillingham in the original printing, according to Jack Adrian's introduction to his collection. The characters of Miss Mapp and Diva Plaistow are clearly recognizable, however, as are their desirable residences. Miss Mapp, for example, here lives in Mallards. The character Susan Leg, appearing briefly in Trouble for Lucia, first appeared as a major character in Benson's novel Secret Lives (1932), which is similar in style to the Mapp and Lucia books.Benson, E. F.: Secret Lives, 1932 Novels by other authors There are also several other books based on the same characters written by other authors.

The recipe was never revealed, but, in the manner of Mrs Beeton, began with the words \\"Take two hen lobsters ...\\" It took its name from the village of Riseholme, where Lucia lived before moving to Tilling, on the Sussex coast, although the dish did not appear in either of the two novels set while Lucia was at Riseholme. Tilling (Rye), where Lucia served Lobster √† la Riseholme Lucia first serves Lobster √† la Riseholme in Tilling to her friend George (\\"Georgie\\") Pillson in Mapp and Lucia (1931) to cheer him up after he discovers that his housemaid Foljambe intends to marry. It then appears at a luncheon party a few weeks later. Lucia resists attempts to reveal the recipe, despite the custom in Tilling of sharing favourite recipes. Lucia's cook refuses Elizabeth Mapp's bribe of half a crown (two shillings and sixpence) to provide a copy. Elizabeth attempts to create the recipe‚Äî\\"Lobster √† la Riseholme √† la Mapp\\", as Benson called it‚Äîat a party of her own but it is not a success. In Gerald Savory's adaptation for television (London Weekend Television 1984) Lucia's guests vie with each other to guess the additional ingredients‚Äîshrimps, cream, tomato, cheese and Marsala are all suggested‚Äîbut this does not happen in the book. On Boxing Day 1930, Elizabeth enters Lucia's kitchen at Grebe, on the outskirts of Tilling, and is able, in Lucia's absence, to transcribe the recipe. Lucia discovers her in the act, but before excuses could be given, the sea wall breaks and Lucia and Elizabeth are swept away on the flood, clinging to the kitchen table. They languish for some weeks on an Italian fishing vessel on the Gallagher Bank, eventually returning to Tilling, where Elizabeth discovers that the recipe has survived the ordeal. Elizabeth subsequently serves a correct Lobster √† la Riseholme at her wedding breakfast, at which point the reason for her being in Lucia's kitchen becomes clear. The dish is served again in Lucia's Progress (1935) at Lucia's housewarming party following her move to Elizabeth's former residence, Mallards. Lobster √† la Riseholme reappears in Tom Holt's pastiche, Lucia in Wartime (1985), set early in the Second World War. Having mastered \\"Woolton pie\\" (an officially sanctioned vegetable dish named after the wartime Food Minister, Lord Woolton.See Marguerite Patten (1985) We'll Eat Again Georgie's triumphant preparation of Lobster √† la Riseholme, using a number of substitute ingredients, leads to his expertise being commended to the Ministry of Food. As a result, he is conscripted for a BBC radio broadcast during which, among other things, he provides a recipe for corned beef √† la Riseholme.

The city has about 1.2 million peopleCensus 2010, and its urban area, joined with that of the neighboring Dongyang, was home to 2,038,413 inhabitants according to the 2010 census. The city is famous for its light industry commodity trade and vibrant market, and as a regional tourist destination. History Yiwu was founded as Wushang County in 222 BCE, right before the Qin dynasty. It was renamed Yiwu County in 624 CE. Trade has been historically important in Yiwu since the surrounding area has little arable soil. Even before 1600s, Yiwu men would carry sewing needles, threads, sugar chunks and other small commodities in their bamboo baskets, using a shoulder-pole, and travel to surrounding rural villages in exchange for chicken feathers. Chicken feathers could be either used as a fertilizer for their own lands, or made into feather dusters for exporting. This \\"Sugar-For- Chicken Feathers\\" tradition had become part of Yiwu culture. As the trading population grew larger, the earliest wholesale markets emerged in Yiwu around 1700s. After the founding of People's Republic of China in 1949, the free market was once considered capitalistic and hence officially suppressed, forcing Yiwu people to continue their trade secretly. It was only after Deng Xiaoping's economic reform in 1978 did the Yiwu market thrive again, becoming one of the first free marketplaces in PRC's history. The cement boards over a stinky ditch nearby Huqingmen street, set up by the local government as the first marketplace in 1982, later became the present day Yiwu International Trade Mart after 27 years of development. In May 1988 the former Yiwu County was upgraded to a county-level city. In 1995 Yiwu ranked the 47th among China's 100 most powerful counties/cities regarding comprehensive economic strength and in the same year listed as Zhejiang's sole city among the nation's experimental counties/cities of comprehensive reform. In 2001 Yiwu's overall economy ranked 19th of all counties (cities) of China. Yiwu's early culture has given birth to a number of notable figures in literature, art, military, education and engineering. Among these were Chen Wangdao, China's first translator of the Communist Manifesto; Wu Han, historian and former deputy mayor of Beijing; Zhu Zhixi, the engineer who harnessed the Yellow River; Zhu Danxi, one of the four distinguished doctors of the Jin and Yuan Dynasties; Zong Ze, a well-known general from the Song Dynasty who resisted aggression by the State of Jin; and the ancestors of Wang Leehom, a famous singer. Buildings near Futian market cluster Geography Yiwu is located south of the city of Hangzhou, the provincial capital. The nearest city to Yiwu is Dongyang. The area, as in most of the Province of Zhejiang, is in a mountainous region. Climate Administration Yiwu is part of the greater Municipal region of Jinhua, although it has a distinct urban core. On China's administrative strata it is a sub-prefecture level city. It has under its jurisdiction 15 towns and eight villages, which covers 1,102.8 square kilometres, 100 square kilometres of which are urban area of 700,000 people (2010 estimate). There has been talk of merging the Yiwu and Jinhua areas into a single municipal zone or economic entity, but this plan has yet to make its way into any formal discussion. The city, in 2020 opened a database for post-2017 domestic violence incidents. According to the All-China Women's Federation, it was the first time a Chinese municipality has enacted such a database. The system was to be launched July 1 that year. The vice president of the Yiwu chapter of the federation, Zhou Danying, stated that in many cases an abusive partner reveals this trait post-marriage. The impetus was an increase in such incidents during the COVID-19 pandemic. In July 2020, Yiwu became the first city in China to allow residents check their partners' domestic violence records, aimed at reducing incidents of domestic violence.

The Yiwu market developed and managed by Zhejiang China Commodities City Group Co., Ltd. (Public, SHA:600415). Yiwu's China Small-Commodity Market has for six consecutive years topped China's 100 top open markets and was for successive years listed as \\"China's civilized open market\\". It has been named as the banner of China's market economy and with a large variety of quality but cheaper commodities. There have been a significant increase in Arab traders since the September 11 attacks, as Middle Eastern businessmen found it difficult to travel to the United States due to visa restrictions. The Arab presence has fostered the rise of many mosques and Middle Eastern restaurants. The GDP reached 52 billion yuan in 2009, an increase of 9% from 2008, and the per capita GDP reached 71,457 yuan (US$10,461). The per capita urban disposable income reached 30,841 yuan and rural pure income 12,899 yuan, increasing 7.4% and 8.5% respectively. Its 4C-grade airport has over a dozen of air routes to cities including Beijing, Guangzhou, Shantou, Weifang and Shenzhen. The Zhejiang-Jiangxi Railway and Hangzhou-Jinhua Expressway passes through the city, making Yiwu an important local transportation hub. By train it is less than three hours from Shanghai. \\"Yiwu, 300 kilometres away from Shanghai, is the largest market of petty commodity wholesales in the world where various foreign buyers go to place orders\\", according to 'Chinese Figures Astonishing the World', joint report from the United Nations,the World Bank and Morgan Stanley. The city was ranked first among county-level cities In \\"the 2004 Most Favourite Chinese Cities of Domestic and Foreign Public in 2004\\". China Commodity City (CCC), the large wholesale market of Yiwu, was honored by the UN, the World Bank and Morgan Stanley amongst other world authorities in 2005 as the \\"largest small commodity wholesale market in the world\\". The counterfeiting industry has been a problem in Yiwu due to the thriving market. As noted by Eamonn Fingleton, the author of In the Jaws of the Dragon: America's Fate in the Coming Era of Chinese Dominance in 2008, \\"As documented by the author Tim Phillips in 2005... [t]he city of Yiwu ... functions as a sort of 'Wall Street' for the counterfeiting industry, providing a vast marketplace where, Phillips states, 100,000 counterfeit products are openly traded and 2,000 metric tons of fakes change hands daily.\\"Eamonn Fingleton, In the Jaws of the Dragon: America's Fate in the Coming Era of Chinese Dominance (New York: Thomas Dunne Books/St. Martin's Press, 2008), 41.

The species in the family are native to Asia, Oceania, the Indian Ocean, and the western Pacific Ocean. The family includes eight genera and about 51 species.

The Heavy Branch of the MGC was the first to use tanks in combat and was subsequently turned into the Tank Corps, later called the Royal Tank Regiment. The MGC remained in existence after the war until it was disbanded in 1922. History An MGC gun team with their Vickers machine gun. Grave of H. Hemming, Machine Gun Corps (Infantry Branch), in Worcestershire. At the outbreak of the First World War in August 1914, the tactical potential of machine guns was not appreciated by the British Armed Forces. The prevalent attitude of senior ranks at the outbreak of the Great War can be summed up by the opinion of an officer (albeit expressed a decade earlier) that a single battery of machine guns per army corps was a sufficient level of issue. Despite the evidence of fighting in Manchuria (1905 onwards) the army therefore went to war with each infantry battalion and cavalry regiment containing a machine gun section of just two guns. These organic (embedded) units were supplemented in November 1914 by the formation of the Motor Machine Gun Service (MMGS) administered by the Royal Artillery, consisting of motor-cycle mounted machine gun batteries. A machine gun school was also opened in France. After a year of warfare on the Western Front it was self-evident that to be fully effective‚Äìin the opinion of former sceptics-that machine guns must be used in larger units and some commanders advocated crewing them with specially trained men who not only thoroughly conversant with their weapons but who understood how they should be best deployed for maximum effect. To achieve this, the Machine Gun Corps was formed in October 1915 with Infantry, Cavalry, and Motor branches, followed in 1916 by the Heavy Branch. A depot and training centre was established at Belton Park in Grantham, Lincolnshire, and a base dep√¥t at Camiers in France. sidecar motorcycle, June 1918. *The Infantry Branch was by far the largest and was formed by the transfer of battalion machine gun sections to the MGC. These sections were grouped into Brigade Machine Gun Companies, three per division. New companies were raised at Grantham. In 1917, a fourth company was added to each division. In February and March 1918, the four companies in each division were formed into a Machine Gun Battalion. * The Guards Division formed its own machine gun support unit, the Guards Machine Gun Regiment. * The Cavalry Branch consisted of Machine Gun Squadrons, one per cavalry brigade. * The Motor Branch was formed by absorbing the MMGS and the armoured car squadrons of the recently disbanded Royal Naval Armoured Car Service. It formed several types of units: motor cycle batteries, light armoured motor batteries (LAMB) and light car patrols. As well as motor cycles, other vehicles used included Rolls-Royce and Ford Model T cars. * The Heavy Section was formed in March 1916, becoming the Heavy Branch in November of that year. Men of this branch crewed the first tanks in action at Flers, during the Battle of the Somme in September 1916. In July 1917, the Heavy Branch separated from the MGC to become the Tank Corps, later called the Royal Tank Regiment. The MGC saw action in all the main theatres of war, including France and Belgium, Palestine, Mesopotamia, Egypt, Salonika, East Africa and Italy. In its short history, the MGC gained an enviable record for heroism as a front line fighting force. Indeed, in the latter part of the war, as tactics changed to defence in depth, it commonly served well in advance of the front line. It had a less enviable record for its casualty rate. Some 170,500 officers and men served in the MGC, with 62,049 becoming casualties, including 12,498 killed, earning it the nickname 'the Suicide Club'. While the undeniable bravery and self-sacrifice of the corps stands testament to the men and their regimental esprit de corps it is also a symptom of the fixed belief on the part of senior commanders that machine guns were confined to a marginal if useful role, that of an adjunct to massed rifle fire, ignoring the proven potential of this weapon in the indirect role (in effect rifle-calibre fire employed as ultra- short artillery.) By correctly setting up the same weapons more commonly used in the direct role (over open sights) the delivering of accurate and sustained fire at high elevation became less an art than a science that could reliably deliver plunging fire at approximately twice the maximum effective range of hand-held weapons of identical calibre, but not so convincingly a belief to hold that the machine gunners were in effect hiding behind the front lines while uselessly firing into the air, making a show instead of dying beside riflemen whose weapons used practically identical ammunition. This conviction may explain‚Äìfrom both sides‚Äìthe persistence with which machine gunners were placed in exposed positions where their fire was only marginally effective but enemy troops could be seen to fall victim to it, and the great personal bravery with which those same men fought when the same enemy concentrated their forces against the greater threat represented by an unsupported sandbag emplacement. As stated by Paul Cornish in Machine Guns and the Great War: 'The theory behind this technique had long been understood... as early as 1908... the mathematical work required to provide a reliable basis for the conduct of such fire was carried out by a group of British enthusiasts at the Hythe musketry school... However, it was 1915 before such fire was successfully carried out in the field...' Cornish goes on 'To conduct such fire the proposed target would be located... the relative position of the machine gun relative to it would be determined with ruler and protractor.. calculations would be made to determine the gun's potential cone of fire and the trajectory of its bullets (an important consideration if firing over the head of friendly troops). A clinometer, combined with a graduated elevation dial fitted to the tripod would be employed to set the gun to the correct elevation...' The obvious complexities and the exacting preparations - in effect identical to those of artillery gunners - may have seemed arcane and pointless to those who carried - or whose men carried - rifles firing the same ammunition but could neither see (or more importantly imagine) the terminal effect of a long-range barrage. When properly employed it was unarguably a devastating deterrent, as witnessed by those who took the trouble to seek out the areas interdicted but for those who took the trouble to do so were often regarded uncritical advocates of novel, untried tactics. This extract from the Vickers machine gun article clearly conveys the concept: The Vickers was used for indirect fire against enemy positions at ranges up to 4,500 yards (2.5 miles or 4.1 kilometres). This plunging fire was used to great effect against road junctions, trench systems, forming up points, and other locations that might be observed by a forward observer, or zeroed in at one time for future attacks, or guessed at by men using maps and experience. Sometimes a location might be zeroed in during the day, and then attacked at night, much to the surprise and confusion of the enemy. While in the more sustained direct fire role, properly supported: Perhaps the most incredible was the action by the 100th Company of the Machine Gun Corps at High Wood on August 24, 1916. This company had ten Vickers guns, and it was ordered to give sustained covering fire for 12 hours onto a selected area 2000 yards away in order to prevent German troops forming up there for a counter-attack while a British attack was in progress... [a] hundred new barrels were used up, and every drop of water in the neighbourhood, including the men‚Äôs drinking water and contents of the latrine buckets, went up in steam to keep the guns cool. And in that 12-hour period the ten guns fired a million rounds... (Weapons & War Machines - Ian V. Hogg & John Batchelor) Towards the end of the Great War some if not all deeply-entrenched attitudes were changing, and not only on the part of British and Commonwealth personnel. Following the extensive barrage fire at Vimy and Messines a demonstration was held on the dunes at Camiers by request of Field Marshal Sir Douglas Haig, Commander-in-Chief (C-in-C) of the British Expeditionary Force on the Western Froht, who insisted all his Corps commanders attend. French observers were treated to a similar demonstration, after which the concept was swiftly introduced into the French Army where it was embraced as a means to economise on artillery shells with the extraordinary assertion the results were more demoralising 'by means of continuity' than the result of shelling. Subsequently a machine gun school was established near the site of both demonstrations and machine gun barrages were successfully employed used by the French forces at Meuse and Verdun. At the end of hostilities, the MGC was re-organised in a smaller form as many of its soldiers returned to civilian life. However, the Corps continued to see active service notably in the Russian Civil War; the Third Anglo-Afghan War, and the ongoing conflict in the Northwest Frontier of India. The MGC also served prominently in the British force that occupied parts of Germany in the period between the Armistice of 1918 and the Versailles Peace Treaty of 1919 as its equipment and training made it possible for a relatively small garrison to control a large population but by 1920 the headquarters in Belton Park was closed and the War Office began to dispose of the many buildings.Buildings In 1922 the Machine Gun Corps was disbanded as a cost-cutting measure.

Dioxooxazolidines Oxazolidines where the carbon centers at the 1 and 3 positions are carbonyls are called dioxooxazolidines. Some of these are commercial fungicides including chlozolinate, vinclozolin, and famoxadone. Bisoxazolidines Bisoxazolidines are chemical compounds that contain two oxazolidine rings, they are used as performance modifiers in polyurethane coatings and paints. The rings hydrolyze in the presence of moisture to give amine and hydroxyl groups, these can then react with diisocyanates, polyisocyanates and polyurethane prepolymers to form a coating.Emission control chembytes e-zine 2001. The use of a bisoxazolidine in a polyurethane systems can prevent the unwanted reaction between isocyanate and moisture resulting in coating defects, as a result of carbon dioxide release. This moisture triggered curing route is preferential to moisture cure. As the ring opening reaction is catalyzed by acids, usually organic acids or anhydrides of carboxylic acids are added in a small amount. The choice of linker between the two oxazolidine rings has a large impact on the performance when used to cure isocyanates. A rigid linker group increases a polyurethanes toughness. A flexible linker group imparts flexibility and increases elongation of a coating. These differences are the reason why bisoxazolidines are used to enhance the performance of polyurethane systems. Usually the rings are linked by esters, urethanes, carbonate or have the two rings fused together. A key intermediate in manufacturing bisoxazolidines is 2-[2-(propan-2-yl)-1,3-oxazolidin-3-yl]ethanol. The hydroxy group on the molecule allows for further reaction with hexamethylene diisocyanate for example. Isoxazolidines In an isoxazolidine nitrogen and oxygen occupy are adjacent (positions 1 and 2 in the ring ), this is the saturated analogue of Isoxazole. isoxazolidine Isoxazolidines can be produced by the nitrone-olefin (3+2) cycloaddition reaction. 500pxg See also * Imidazole, an analog with the oxygen replaced by a nitrogen. * Thiazole, an analog with the oxygen replaced by a sulfur. * Benzoxazole, where the oxazole is fused to another aromatic ring. * Pyrrole, an analog without the oxygen atom. * Furan, an analog without the nitrogen atom. * Oxazoline, which has only one double bond reduced. * Oxazolidinedione, which has two in-cycle keto groups (a carbamate and a lactam). * Oxazolidinone, which has an in-cycle carbamate.

Formerly owned by Pyramid Breweries, Inc., it was sold in 2007 to Adventure Funds of Portland, Oregon, which is running the company under the Kemper Co. name. Thomas Kemper Brewing of Poulsbo was sold to Hart Brewing (later known as Pyramid) in 1992. (Thomas Kemper had been founded in 1985 on Bainbridge Island, and began making soft drinks in 1990.) Thomas Kemper Soda was first brewed by Andy Thomas and Will Kemper (now brewing at Bellingham's Chuckanut) as alternative to beer at an Octoberfest celebration on Bainbridge Island, WA in 1990. The first Thomas Kemper Soda was handcrafted Root Beer. Thomas Kemper Sodas are still handcrafted and made with honey (although cane sugar is the primary sweetener), Madagascar vanilla, and other flavors available. The soda comes in eight flavors: Root Beer, Vanilla Cream, Orange Cream, Ginger Ale, Grape, Black Cherry, Ginger Peach and Oregon Marionberry. Previously, there were Thomas Kemper varieties of Birch Beer and Cola as well. History Thomas Kemper started as a 1980s Microbrewery well ahead of its time. The people involved had developed their brewing into an art and, as is standard with beer wanted to share it with the world. They grew the local following until the seams burst and, moved in to what they considered a large brewing facility. They converted an old dairy farm near Poulsbo Washington. It became their new brewery. They exploded again. They made Thomas Kemper into a \\"local\\" brand known almost exclusively to the Pacific Northwest. (Think Elysian, Silver City, or Sound Brewery*) The Kemper beers drew aficionados from afar, and the Friday night fare at the brewery drew the locals. The Thomas Kemper Soda line was an example of fruit not falling far from the tree. The \\"beer\\" and \\"soda\\" companies were kept separate and while one lives on in label, not so much as family endeavor but in the spirit of its founding fathers, something for all. 1990: The first batch of Thomas Kemper Soda, Thomas Kemper Root Beer, was created for the Thomas Kemper Oktoberfest. Since 1989, the Thomas Kemper Brewing Company, one of the Northwest's first Microbreweries, held an annual Oktoberfest celebration at their brewery. Starting out as a small event, the Thomas Kemper Oktoberfest soon was adding thousands of extra people to the population of Poulsbo, WA each autumn. 1991: Having done so well at the Thomas Kemper Oktoberfest, the Thomas Kemper Soda Company was formed. With very little advertising or marketing dollars, the young company relies on a \\"grassroots\\" campaign to get the word on its sodas out to consumers. 1992: The Thomas Kemper Brewing Company starts to grow, but is in need of the means to do it. Washington's Hart Brewery buys Thomas Kemper and one of the craft beer industry's first mergers takes place. Since the Soda operation had been separated from the parent firm, as a result of a divorce action between firm owners, it was not part of this deal and the folks at Hart will have to wait a few years to re-unite the sibling breweries. 1996: Thomas Kemper Sodas made the Guinness Book of World Records for creating the world's largest root beer float. Using a 4,000-ton carbonating tank and 900 gallons of ice cream, Thomas Kemper made a 2,166.5 gallon root beer float. 1997: Thomas Kemper Sodas are re-united with the Thomas Kemper Beer when Pyramid Breweries Inc. buys Thomas Kemper Sodas. The move provides resources to help the soda company grow. 1997: To kick-off the summer, Thomas Kemper Sodas introduces its Thomas Kemper Orange Cream Soda. 1998: Thomas Kemper introduces its next flavor, Thomas Kemper Black Cherry Soda. 2001: Thomas Kemper launches two new soda fountain classics, Ginger Ale and Grape. 2007: Thomas Kemper is sold by Pyramid.Thomas Kemper Soda 2011: Thomas Kemper is sold to Big Red, Inc.

Origins In December 1945 Amir Sjarifoeddin's Socialist Party of Indonesia (Parsi) and Sutan Sjahrir's Socialist People's Party (Parsas), both of which had only recently been established, merged to form the Socialist Party. Sjahrir became leader of the combined party. It was popular among young intellectuals and students as well as members of the underground movements led by the two men during the Japanese occupation of Indonesia.Kahin (1952) p158 At the end of 1945 the Socialist Party gained five of the 25 seats on the working committee of the Central Indonesian National Committee, the de facto legislature.Kahin (1952) p171 Both Sutan and Amir served terms as prime minister, while other Socialist Party members held senior cabinet posts.Simanjuntak (2003) From 1947, divisions appeared between Sutan and Amir as Amir and his communist allies gained more and more influence over the party. In June 1947 Amir ousted Sutan. The second party called the Socialist Party of Indonesia was founded on 12 February 1948 by Sutan Sjahrir after his departure from the Socialist Party.Feith (2007) p129Cribb & Kahin (2004) p328 The PSI in the Liberal Democracy Era Sjahrir speaking at a PSI election meeting in Bali, 1955 Following the dissolution of the United States of Indonesia and the reestablishment of the unitary Republic of Indonesia in 1950, the PSI was awarded 17 of the 232 seats in the new legislature, the People's Representative Council (DPR), a total in proportion to the estimated strength of the party Ricklefs (1991) p230 The PSI held its first party congress in 1952.Wijono. The General Elections in Indonesia and the Partai Sosialis Indonesia, in Socialist Asia, Vol IV, November 1955/February 1956, Nos. 3-4. p. 13 In the 1955 legislative election the PSI won only 2% of the vote, resulting in five seats in the legislature. This was a far smaller share of the vote than had been expected.Ricklefs (1991) p238Feith (2007) p436 The second party congress was held in June 1955. Decline and fall After the 1955 elections, a clear political division between Java and the outer islands opened up. This was followed by a military crisis brought about by army chief- of-staff General Nasution's plan to implement widespread transfers of officers, many of whom had built up private business interests in the regions. On 20 July 1956, the most prominent non-Javanese politician, Vice-president Hatta, resigned with effect from 1 December. Tired of the political infighting, on 28 October, President Sukarno called for an end to political parties. This would lead to his 1957 conception of ‚Äúguided democracy‚Äù, which the PSI opposed.Ricklefs (1991) pp. 238-243Feith (2007) p541 In December 1956, several army commanders in Sumatra announced they had taken over civil government. This crisis spread and in March 1957, the military commander of East Indonesia imposed martial law over his command area. On March 1957 the cabinet resigned and Sukarno proclaimed martial law nationwide. In May 1957, PSI economist Professor Sumitro Djojohadikusumo left Jakarta for Sumatra, followed by other political figures. In January 1958, the PSI demanded a new cabinet, and the following month dissidents in Padang, West Sumatra issued an ultimatum demanding the dissolution of the cabinet within five days. Despite efforts by the PSI in Jakarta to forestall a rebellion, on 15 February a rebel government was proclaimed in Bukitinggi called the Revolutionary Government of the Republic of Indonesia (PRRI). It was headed by Amir Sjarifoeddin as Prime Minister and included Burhanuddin Harahap from the Masyumi Party and Sumitro Djojohadikusumo. Hatta and PSI leaders in Jakarta called for a negotiated settlement, but the government decided on a military solution, which defeated the rebellion by mid-1958.Ricklefs (1991) pp. 242-251 Sukarno implemented his plan for guided democracy by issuing a decree restoring the 1945 Constitution. The PSI was not represented in either the new cabinet, the Supreme Advisory Council nor the National Planning Council established under the new system. Finally, in August 1960, President Sukarno formally banned the PSI and the Masyumi Party for their opposition to Guided Democracy and their alleged support of the PRRI rebellion.Ricklefs (1991) pp. 254-256 Party philosophy The party's philosophy was based on Fabianism with elements of Marxist social analysis. There was a distinct Indonesian character to the party's brand of socialism. It stressed the need for modernization, economic development and rational planning and organization, while opposing extreme nationalism and anti-foreign sentiment. It accepted the need for foreign capital, but party leaders criticized what they saw as the Hatta cabinet's overcautious foreign policy and the strong influence of the United States over it. They strongly opposed the party siding with either the United States or the Soviet Union. Rather than building support among the masses, the party aimed to develop a well-trained core of members. It had considerable influence among high-level bureaucrats and the leadership of the army. Sultan Hamengkubuwana IX and Nasution did not belong to the PSI, but they had strong informal links with it.Feith (2007) p130Ricklefs (1991) p233Kahin (1952) pp. 319-322 See also *Gerakan Tani Indonesia References *Cribb, R.

The east‚Äìwest highway travels and connects SR 525 in Mukilteo to Interstate 5 (I-5) in southern Everett. It serves the Boeing Everett Factory and Paine Field and is named the Boeing Freeway. The highway also serves as a main route to the city of Mukilteo and the state-run ferry to Whidbey Island. Route description SR 526 westbound in Everett SR 526 begins as 84th Street Southwest at a signalized intersection with SR 525, named the Mukilteo Speedway, at Nelsons Corner in Mukilteo. The highway travels east through a residential neighborhood, heading towards an intersection with Paine Field Boulevard, signed as SR 525 Spur, at the Future of Flight Aviation Center and Paine Field. SR 526 turns northeast as the four- lane continuation of Paine Field Boulevard, curving north around the north- south runway of Paine Field and south of Japanese Gulch, into the city of Everett. The highway becomes the controlled-access Boeing Freeway and passes under the Boeing Access Road, a taxiway that connects the Boeing Everett Factory to Paine Field. SR 526 continues east and intersects Airport Road in a diamond interchange and Seaway Boulevard in a semi-directional T interchange, the main access roads to Paine Field and the Boeing factory, respectively, before widening to six lanes as it approaches its eastern terminus, an interchange with I-5. The freeway travels through a diamond interchange with Evergreen Way, located east of a pedestrian bridge over SR 526 and south of Cascade High School, where traffic heading towards I-5 northbound on a left directional exit and traffic heading towards I-5 southbound splits into two lanes, a normal lane and a high-occupancy vehicle lane (HOV lane). SR 526 continues east, briefly paralleling the Interurban Trail, before the freeway travels towards I-5 on flyover ramps and the highway terminates at the northern terminus of SR 99 and the northern terminus of SR 527. Every year, the Washington State Department of Transportation (WSDOT) conducts a series of surveys on its highways in the state to measure traffic volume. This is expressed in terms of average annual daily traffic (AADT), which is a measure of traffic volume for any average day of the year. In 2013, WSDOT calculated that the busiest section of SR 526 was its interchange with Evergreen Way, carrying 75,000 vehicles, while the least busiest section of the highway was its western terminus at SR 525, carrying 8,500 vehicles. SR 526 is designated as part of the National Highway System for its whole length, classifying it as important to the national economy, defense, and mobility. WSDOT designates the entire route of SR 526 as a Highway of Statewide Significance, which includes highways that connect major communities in the state of Washington. History SR 526 was established during the 1964 state highway renumbering as the successor to SSH 1I between Mukilteo and Everett. The highways were preceded by the Mukilteo-Everett wagon road that was opened on August 14, 1914, traveling east along Possession Sound between Mukilteo and Everett, later renamed to Mukilteo Boulevard during the 1920s. The boulevard route had previously been surveyed in 1882 for a wagon road connecting Mukilteo to Lowell (now part of Everett) by the county government. SSH 1I was designated in 1937 along the route of Mukilteo Boulevard and a new highway connecting Mukilteo to U.S. Route 99 (US 99) in Lynnwood, traveling in a circular arc. SSH 1I was split into SR 525 from Lynnwood to Mukilteo and SR 526 from Mukilteo to Everett during the 1964 state highway renumbering. The eastern terminus of SR 526, an interchange with I-5 in Everett, was completed in February 1965 and later became the southern terminus of SR 529 until 1991. The interchange was later converted to a single-point urban interchange in 2007 as part of a WSDOT project to improve I-5 through Everett. The current freeway alignment was completed in the early 1980s. When Boeing expanded their factory in the early 1990s, the state of Washington required that Boeing pay for upgrades to the connection between SR 526 and I-5. These upgrades resulted in a direct connection being built to connect SR 526 to I-5 north, whereas previously one had to travel south on SR 527 in order to connect to I-5 north. Additional upgrades included an HOV queue lane for the I-5 southbound on-ramp, and the construction of sound walls along the freeway. Until 2000, SR 526 and 84th St. in Mukilteo was a continuous alignment. When Paine Field Blvd. (SR 525 Spur) was completed in 2000, the alignment was changed to make the SR 526 expressway and Paine Field Blvd. continuous. The new intersection with 84th St. facilitate the creation of a new Boeing museum, the Future of Flight Aviation Center & Boeing Tour. There are tentative plans to realign SR 525 to intersect with SR 526 near the head of Japanese Gulch, in order to facilitate a new ferry dock in Mukilteo and to avoid the population center of the city. While the plans for the new dock have been finalized, no plans have been presented for such a connection, aside from the construction of SR 525 Spur.

More generally, one may consider :m_n = \\\\int_{-\\\\infty}^\\\\infty M_n(x) \\\\,d\\\\mu(x)\\\\,. for an arbitrary sequence of functions Mn.  Introduction  In the classical setting, Œº is a measure on the real line, and M is the sequence { xn : n = 0, 1, 2, ... }. In this form the question appears in probability theory, asking whether there is a probability measure having specified mean, variance and so on, and whether it is unique. There are three named classical moment problems: the Hamburger moment problem in which the support of Œº is allowed to be the whole real line; the Stieltjes moment problem, for [0, +‚àû); and the Hausdorff moment problem for a bounded interval, which without loss of generality may be taken as [0, 1]. Existence A sequence of numbers mn is the sequence of moments of a measure Œº if and only if a certain positivity condition is fulfilled; namely, the Hankel matrices Hn, :(H_n)_{ij} = m_{i+j}\\\\,, should be positive semi- definite. This is because a positive-semidefinite Hankel matrix corresponds to a linear functional \\\\Lambda such that \\\\Lambda(x^n) = m_n and \\\\Lambda(f^2) \\\\geq 0 (non-negative for sum of squares of polynomials). Assume \\\\Lambda can be extended to \\\\mathbb{R}[x]^*. In the univariate case, a non-negative polynomial can always be written as a sum of squares. So the linear functional \\\\Lambda is positive for all the non-negative polynomials in the univariate case. By Haviland's theorem, the linear functional has a measure form, that is \\\\Lambda(x^n) = \\\\int_{-\\\\infty}^{\\\\infty} x^n d \\\\mu. A condition of similar form is necessary and sufficient for the existence of a measure \\\\mu supported on a given interval [a, b]. One way to prove these results is to consider the linear functional \\\\varphi that sends a polynomial : P(x) = \\\\sum_k a_k x^k to : \\\\sum_k a_k m_k. If mkn are the moments of some measure Œº supported on [a, b], then evidently Vice versa, if () holds, one can apply the M. Riesz extension theorem and extend \\\\phi to a functional on the space of continuous functions with compact support C0([a, b]), so that By the Riesz representation theorem, () holds iff there exists a measure Œº supported on [a, b], such that : \\\\varphi(f) = \\\\int f \\\\, d\\\\mu for every ∆í ‚àà C0([a, b]). Thus the existence of the measure \\\\mu is equivalent to (). Using a representation theorem for positive polynomials on [a, b], one can reformulate () as a condition on Hankel matrices. See and for more details.  Uniqueness (or determinacy)  The uniqueness of Œº in the Hausdorff moment problem follows from the Weierstrass approximation theorem, which states that polynomials are dense under the uniform norm in the space of continuous functions on [0, 1]. For the problem on an infinite interval, uniqueness is a more delicate question; see Carleman's condition, Krein's condition and .  Variations  An important variation is the truncated moment problem, which studies the properties of measures with fixed first k moments (for a finite k). Results on the truncated moment problem have numerous applications to extremal problems, optimisation and limit theorems in probability theory.

Life and playing career Born in Liverpool, Byrne, like Jimmy Melia, joined Liverpool straight from school as a 15-year-old in 1953. Again like Melia, Byrne impressed manager Don Welsh who offered the full-back a professional contract the day after his 17th birthday on 30 August 1955. It was just over two years later that Byrne made his debut; Charlton Athletic thrashed the Reds 5‚Äì1 in a league match at The Valley on 28 September 1957, he had to wait a further 4¬Ω years for his first goal which came in the 52nd minute of a 3‚Äì1 2nd Division win over Brighton at Anfield on 3 February 1962. His debut was his only appearance during season 1957‚Äì58. Bill Shankly was appointed manager in December 1959 and at the season's end had a clear out of 24 players. Notably Byrne was retained as was Roger Hunt. It was not until the arrival of Bill Shankly that he really got his chance; he featured in 38 league and cup matches as the Reds finished third for the fifth time in a row in the second division. Considering he only played seven times in the previous three seasons this was a major improvement in Gerry's career; in fact, he was on the transfer list when Shankly arrived, soon to be removed. Shankly again used Byrne's grit and determination to its fullest, he was an ever-present as Liverpool, finally, romped to the 2nd division title, beating Leyton Orient into second spot by eight points. He played in 38 of Liverpool's 42 league games their first year back in the big time and he also played in all seven of Liverpool's cup ties during their run to the 1965 FA Cup final, a game in which Byrne would write his name in Liverpool folklore forever more. =The 1965 FA Cup Final= Byrne played for Liverpool in the 1965 FA Cup Final, which took place on 1 May at Wembley, with a broken collarbone. He suffered the injury as early as the third minute, but played on throughout the rest of the game and the whole of extra-time as Liverpool won the Cup for the very first time. The break happened after Byrne was challenged heftily by Leeds United's captain Bobby Collins, but, with substitutes still not permitted by the authorities in 1965, he had little choice but to carry on playing. The game went to extra-time and Byrne, despite the pain, kept making his familiar marauding runs down the left flank in joining the attack. Early on into the first period of extra time, he reached the by-line with the ball and pulled back a perfect cross for Roger Hunt to open the scoring. Leeds got back into the game and equalised through Billy Bremner but Liverpool were not to be denied as Ian St. John headed home the winner late on during the second period securing Liverpools first ever FA Cup. Shankly spoke highly of Gerry in an interview after the final saying \\"It was a performance of raw courage from the boy\\". The aftermath of another high- profile match led to calls, again, for the Football Association to allow a substitute to be selected by each team in competitive matches. In FA Cup finals over the previous decade there had been a notable number of teams reduced to ten men or hampered considerably by hard challenges from opposition players. This included goalkeepers Bert Trautmann (in 1955) and Ray Wood (in 1957) suffering a broken neck and broken cheekbone respectively; while two wingers in successive years were stretchered off with broken legs (Roy Dwight in 1959 and Dave Whelan in 1960) and a full back left hobbling for three- quarters of the game with a damaged ankle (Len Chalmers in 1961). Byrne's injury was the latest to try to force the FA's hand and, eventually, two years later the first substitutes were allowed in the FA Cup final. =After the final and beyond= The 1965‚Äì66 campaign was another triumphant one for Byrne and the Reds as he was an ever-present in Liverpool's second title win in three years. Byrne, along with winger Ian Callaghan and Hunt, were rewarded for their superb club form by being selected in Alf Ramsey's England squad for the 1966 World Cup finals to be held on home soil. In the 1966 World Cup final only the 11 players on the pitch at the end of the 4‚Äì2 win over West Germany received medals. Following a Football Association led campaign to persuade FIFA to award medals to all the winners' squad members, Byrne was presented with his medal by Gordon Brown at a ceremony at 10 Downing Street on 10 June 2009. Byrne won two international caps for England. He made his international debut on 6 April 1963, in a British Home Championship match against Scotland at Wembley. The Scots won 2‚Äì1 in a game which saw fellow Liverpool teammate Jimmy Melia make his England debut. His second (and last) cap came in a friendly match preceding the 1966 World Cup. Jimmy Greaves scored four goals as England won 6‚Äì1 against Norway. Byrne stayed on at Anfield until 1969 when injury ended his career. He was replaced by Alec Lindsay.

It was written in 2 AD. Background Book one of Ars amatoria was written to show a man how to find a woman. In book two, Ovid shows how to keep her. The third book, written two years after the first books were published, gives women advice on how to win and keep the love of a man (\\"I have just armed the Greeks against the Amazons; now, Penthesilea, it remains for me to arm thee against the Greeks...\\").. Content The first two books, aimed at men, contain sections which cover such topics as 'not forgetting her birthday', 'letting her miss you - but not for long' and 'not asking about her age'. The third gives similar advice to women, sample themes include: 'making up, but in private', 'being wary of false lovers' and 'trying young and older lovers'. Although the book was finished around 2 AD, much of the advice he gives is applicable to any day and age. His intent is often more profound than the brilliance of the surface suggests. In connection with the revelation that the theatre is a good place to meet girls, for instance, Ovid, the classically educated trickster, refers to the story of the rape of the Sabine women. It has been argued that this passage represents a radical attempt to redefine relationships between men and women in Roman society, advocating a move away from paradigms of force and possession, towards concepts of mutual fulfilment.Dutton, Jacqueline, The Rape of the Sabine Women, Ovid Ars amatoria Book I: 101-134, master's dissertation, University of Johannesburg, 2005 The superficial brilliance, however, befuddles even scholars (paradoxically, Ovid consequently tended in the 20th century to be underrated as lacking in seriousness). The standard situations and clich√©s of the subject are treated in an entertainment-intended way, with details from Greek mythology, everyday Roman life and general human experience. Ovid likens love to military service, supposedly requiring the strictest obedience to the woman. He advises women to make their lovers artificially jealous so that they do not become neglectful through complacency. Perhaps accordingly, a slave should be instructed to interrupt the lovers' tryst with the cry 'Perimus' ('We are lost!'), compelling the young lover to hide in fear in a cupboard. The tension implicit in this uncommitted tone is reminiscent of a flirt, and in fact, the semi-serious, semi-ironic form is ideally suited to Ovid's subject matter. It is striking that through all his ironic discourse, Ovid never becomes ribald or obscene. Of course 'embarrassing' matters can never be entirely excluded, for 'praecipue nostrum est, quod pudet, inquit, opus'Ov, Ars am. 3,769 'what brings a blush ... is our especial business here'. Sexual matters in the narrower sense are only dealt with at the end of each book, so here again, form and content converge in a subtly ingenious way. Things, so to speak, always end up in bed. But here, too, Ovid retains his style and his discretion, avoiding any pornographic tinge. The end of the second book deals with the pleasures of simultaneous orgasm. Somewhat atypically for a Roman, the poet confesses, Odi concubitus, qui non utrumque resolvunt. Hoc est, cur pueri tangar amore minusOv, Ars am. 2,683 ('I don't like intercourse that doesn't make both lovers come. That's why I'm less into the love of boys.'). At the end of the third part, as in the Kama Sutra, the sexual positions are 'declined', and from them women are exhorted to choose the most suitable, taking the proportions of their own bodies into careful consideration. Ovid's tongue is again discovered in his cheek when his recommendation that tall women should not straddle their lovers is exemplified at the expense of the tallest hero of the Trojan Wars: Quod erat longissima, numquam Thebais Hectoreo nupta resedit equoOv, Ars am. 3,778 ('Since she was very tall, the daughter of Thebes (Andromache) as wife never mounted Hector as horse'). However, the word ars in the title is not to be translated coldly as 'technique', or as 'art' in the sense of civilized refinement, but as \\"textbook\\", the literal and antique definition of the word. Appropriately for its subject, the Ars amatoria is composed in elegiac couplets, rather than the dactylic hexameters, which are more usually associated with the didactic poem. Reception The work was such a popular success that the poet wrote a sequel, Remedia Amoris (Remedies for Love). At an early recitatio, however, S. Vivianus Rhesus is noted as having walked out in disgust.Agr. De art. am. 378-9 The assumption that the 'licentiousness' of the Ars amatoria was responsible in part for Ovid's relegation (banishment) by Augustus in 8 AD is dubious, and seems rather to reflect modern sensibilities than historical fact. For one thing, the work had been in circulation for eight years by the time of the relegation, and it postdates the Julian Marriage Laws by eighteen years. Secondly, it is hardly likely that Augustus, after forty years unchallenged in the purple, felt the poetry of Ovid to be a serious threat or even embarrassment to his social policies. Thirdly, Ovid's own statementOv. Tr., 2.207 from his Black Sea exile that his relegation was because of 'carmen et error' ('a song and a mistake') is, for many reasons, hardly admissible. It is more probable that Ovid was somehow caught up in factional politics connected with the succession: Agrippa Postumus, Augustus' adopted son, and Augustus' granddaughter, Vipsania Julilla, were both relegated at around the same time. This would also explain why Ovid was not reprieved when Augustus was succeeded by Agrippa's rival Tiberius. It is likely, then, that the Ars amatoria was used as an excuse for the relegation.F. Norwood (1964), 'The Riddle of Ovid's Relegatio', in Classical Philology. 58: 150-63 This would be neither the first nor the last time a 'crackdown on immorality' disguised an uncomfortable political secret. Legacy The Ars amatoria created considerable interest at the time of its publication. On a lesser scale, Martial's epigrams take a similar context of advising readers on love. Modern literature has been continually influenced by the Ars amatoria, which has presented additional information on the relationship between Ovid's poem and more current writings.e.g. Gibson, R., Green, S., Sharrock, A., (eds.) 'The Art of Love: Bimillennial Essays on Ovid's Ars amatoria and Remedia Amoris', OUP 2007; Sprung, Robert C., 'The Reception of Ovid's Ars amatoria in the Age of Goethe', Senior Thesis, Harvard College, 1984. The Ars amatoria was included in the syllabuses of mediaeval schools from the second half of the 11th century, and its influence on 12th and 13th centuries' European literature was so great that the German mediaevalist and palaeographer Ludwig Traube dubbed the entire age 'aetas Ovidiana' ('the Ovidian epoch').McKinley, K.L., Reading the Ovidian Heroine, Brill, Leiden, 2001, xiii As in the years immediately following its publication, the Ars amatoria has historically been victim of moral outcry. All of Ovid's works were burned by Savonarola in Florence, Italy in 1497; an English translation of the Ars amatoria was seized by U.S. Customs in 1930.Haight, A. L. and Grannis, C. B., Banned Books 387 BCE to 1978 CE, R.R. Bowker & Co, 1978 Despite the actions against the work, it continues to be studied in college courses on Latin literature. It is possible that Edmond Rostand's fictionalized portrayal of Cyrano de Bergerac makes an allusion to the Ars amatoria: the theme of the erotic and seductive power of poetry is highly suggestive of Ovid's poem, and Bergerac's nose, a distinguishing feature invented by Rostand, calls to mind Ovid's cognomen, Naso (from nasus, 'large-nosed').

Prepaid phone cards are provided by various telecom companies. When you purchase a prepaid phone card, you are paying for long distance connection time in advance. When you make calls using the phone card, the card's value is deducted based on connection fee, duration of connection, surcharges and any maintenance charges associated with the phone card. Prepaid telephone calls are usually implemented in the company's network using the intelligent network functionality. The competitive prices these operators offer are usually made possible by least cost routing and lower overheads than the larger telephone operators. Types of prepaid calling * Telephone prepaid calling cards (commonly known as Phone Cards in the US and the UK) are available from newsstands and drugstores. They are often the cheapest means of making long-distance or even international telephone calls. Moreover, they offer complete anonymity. Phone cards sold by retailers are live (active) when purchased by consumers. * Web sites offer prepaid Personal identification numbers (PINs) for calling; thus there is no physical phone card. Prepaid online calling cards are more convenient to use, because most of the companies provide the option of registering the phone and avoiding using PINs at all. Rates vary from provider to provider, but the customer should be aware that cards with cheaper rates usually have hidden maintenance and/or connection fees. * Prepaid calling operators offer services to customers who hold accounts with them and have paid money in advance. The service is typically accessed by the user dialling a toll free number from any telephone (PSTN, call box, mobile phone etc.). The user then authenticates himself with the operator by entering a PIN, types in the digits of the number to connect to, and then is connected by the operator. Often these operators have toll free numbers all over the world, so a customer can access the service even when he is abroad. * Prepaid mobile phones are offered by most mobile phone operators around the world. Typically all the usual mobile phone services are available to prepaid users, except that they have to top up their balance in advance before they can be used. This is done via a variety of mechanisms - vouchers (commonly called \\"power cards\\"), swipe cards, debit and credit cards. An IVR is usually provided to allow the user to find out his current balance by dialling a short code. After the balance has been topped up, a user may make calls, send text messages and listen to voicemail in the usual way. For mobile prepaid typically use INAP or CAP protocol.

Early life Alcock was born in St James's, Middlesex,1891 England Census the son of the physician, Dr. Thomas Alcock, who practised at Ealing, near London, and his wife, Mary. As he grew up, Alcock followed his father into the medical profession. In 1836, he became a surgeon in the marine brigade which took part in the Carlist War, gaining distinction through his services. Alcock was made deputy inspector-general of hospitals. He retired from this service in 1837. Service in China In 1844, he was appointed consul at Fuchow in China, where, after a short official stay at Amoy, he performed the functions, as he expressed it, \\"of everything from a lord chancellor to a sheriff's officer.\\" Fuchow was one of the ports opened to trade by the Treaty of Nanking, and Alcock had to perform an entirely new role with regard to the Chinese authorities. He served there for 18 months, arriving in March 1845 (his wife followed shortly after, when appropriate accommodation was found, and his sister in law Emma S. Bacon, and mother in law, Mrs. Bacon, arrived one year later).The Englishman in China during the Victorian era : as illustrated in the career of Sir Rutherford Alcock, K.C.B., D.C.L., many years consul and minister in China and Japan by Alexander Michie. He was able to work on restoring peace and order and in doing so, he earned a promotion to the consulate at Shanghai. Alcock, along with his wife, Henrietta, sister-in-law, and mother-in-law, moved to Shanghai in the fall of 1846, where they were part of a burgeoning community of expats, merchants and missionaries from England, France, and North America. Alcock made it a special part of his duties to superintend the established Chinese government and lay out the British settlement, which had developed into such an important feature of British commercial life in China. This included initially hosting a small church in his home, which his sister in law described as \\"...an immense rambling Chinese House containing fifty two Rooms / surrounded by courtyards, and divided by Galleries and Passages in all directions\\". In April 1847 it was, however, decided to apply to the Church Missionary Society for a Clergyman and to plan and build a church on land donated by a merchant, and it appears that Rutherford was heavily involved in this initiative. Emma S. Bacon, Alcock's sister-in-law, writes in April 1847, that the consulate was about two miles from Alcock's house and was to be built on ground \\"...by the River Side appropriated to the English...but as it is not yet commenced, it is uncertain when we shall inhabit it + but on the site appropriated for the Building Rutherford has at present Offices and a pretty sitting Room for our use, opening into a garden very nicely arranged...\\". In 1853 Alcock's wife, Henrietta died (March), and the Taiping rebellion reached Shanghai. The city was besieged and attacked until February 1855 when the rebels were starved and burned out of the city. Alcock remained in Shanghai until April of that year to restore peace and order, and then moved on to the Consulate in Canton, the original seat of much unrest in the 1840s. He was stationed in Canton for 1 year and then took a furlough to return home to England in October 1856, just before tensions once again ignited in Canton. Service in Japan (1858‚Äì64) Rutherford Alcock located the British legation in Tokyo from 1859 in T≈çzen-ji. Attack on the British legation in T≈çzen-ji on 5 July 1861. Attack of the British legation in T≈çzen-ji, Edo, in 1861. In 1858, he was appointed Consul- General in Japan.The first British Ambassador to Japan was appointed in 1905. Before 1905, the senior British diplomat had different titles: (a) Consul- General and Envoy Extraordinary and Minister Plenipotentiary, which is a rank just below Ambassador. Alcock opened the second British legation in Japan within the grounds of T≈çzen-ji in Takanawa, Edo (now Tokyo), the first being at Hiogo (Kobe), under Sir Harry Parkes and the vice-consul Frank Gerard Myberg (also known as Francis Gerard Mijburg and Frans Gerard Mijberg, died 18 January 1868 buried at Kobe). He saw In those days, foreign residents in Japan faced some danger, with noticeable Japanese hostility to foreigners (sonn≈ç j≈çi). In 1860, Alcock's native interpreter was murdered at the gate of the legation, and in the following year the legation was stormed by a group of ronin from the fiefdom of Mito-han, whose attack was repulsed by Alcock and his staff. In September 1860 he became the first non-Japanese to climb Mount Fuji. Service in China (1865‚Äì69) Shortly after these events he returned to England on leave in March 1862, and was replaced in Japan by Colonel Neale. Alcock had already been made a Commander of the Bath (CB) (1860). In 1862 he was made a Knight of the same order (KCB), and in 1863 received an honorary Doctorate of Laws from Oxford University. In 1864, he returned to Japan, and after a year's further residence he was transferred to Peking, where he represented the British government until 1869, when he retired. Later years Although no longer in official life, he remained active. He was for some years president of the Royal Geographical Society, and he served on many commissions. The official Japanese section at the 1862 International Exhibition in London was prepared by Sir Rutherford and included his own collection. This is considered one of the most important events in the history of Japanese art in the West and a founding date for English Japonism in the decorative arts, the Anglo-Japanese style. From 1882-93 he was chairman of the British North Borneo Chartered Company. He was twice married, first in May 1841 to Henrietta Mary Bacon (daughter of Charles Bacon), who died in 1853, and second (on 8 July 1862) to the widow of the Rev. John Lowder. His second wife died on 13 March 1899. Alcock was the author of several works, and was one of the first to awaken in England an interest in Japanese art. He tried hard to learn the language and even wrote a textbook. His best-known book is The Capital of the Tycoon [= shogun], which appeared in 1863, whilst the Mikado's Seat was at Kyoto. He died in London on 2 November 1897, and is buried at Merstham in Surrey. (R. K. D.)

He is said by Vitruvius to have invented scene-painting, and to have painted a scene (scenam fecit) for a tragedy which Aeschylus exhibited.Vitruvius, Praef. ad lib. vii Hence some writers, such as Karl Woermann, have supposed that he introduced perspective and illusion into painting. However, as this appears to contradict Aristotle's assertion that scene-painting was introduced by Sophocles,Aristotle, Poetics 4. ¬ß i 6 some scholars understand Vitruvius to mean merely that Agatharchus constructed a stage.Compare Horace, Epistula ad Pisones 279: et modicis instravit pulpita tignis But the context shows clearly that perspective painting must be meant, for Vitruvius goes on to say that Democritus and Anaxagoras, carrying out the principles laid down in a treatise written by Agatharchus, wrote on the same subject, showing how, in drawing, the lines ought to be made to correspond, according to a natural proportion, to the figure which would be traced out on an imaginary intervening plane by a pencil of rays proceeding from the eye, as a fixed point of sight, to the several points of the object viewed. It was probably not till towards the end of Aeschylus's career that scene-painting was introduced, and not till the time of Sophocles that it was generally made use of; which may account for what Aristotle says. Agatharchus was therefore the first painter known to have used graphical perspective on a large scale, although rare occurrences of perspective do appear in vase painting around the middle of the 6th century BC. He is also said to have led the way for later painters, such as Apollodorus. Agatharchus was a contemporary of Alcibiades and Zeuxis, and was often singled out for the ease and rapidity with which he finished his works.Plutarch, Pericles 13 Plutarch and Andocides at greater length tell an anecdote of Alcibiades having inveigled Agatharchus to his house and kept him there for more than three months in strict durance, compelling him to paint it.Plutarch, Alcibiades 16 The speech of Andocides above referred to seems to have been delivered after the destruction of Melos (416 BC) and before the expedition to Sicily (415 BC); so that from the above data the age of Agatharchus may be accurately fixed.

After his release from Wolves' academy, Collymore signed for non-league Stafford Rangers, where he caught the eye of First Division side Crystal Palace who signed him in January 1991. He failed to break into the first team and subsequently dropped down to the Second Division (renamed as the First Division in 1992) with Southend United, for whom his goalscoring record helped save from relegation and attract attention from Nottingham Forest, who he joined in the summer of 1993 for ¬£2.25 million. Collymore enjoyed two prolific seasons at Forest, earning promotion to the Premier League in his first season and scoring 22 goals as Forest finished in third place during the 1994-1995 season. Perennial title challengers Liverpool signed him in 1995, where he initially formed a successful partnership with Robbie Fowler, but was eventually ousted in favour of younger striker Michael Owen and sold on to boyhood club Aston Villa in 1997, where his form dipped and he struggled to break into the first team. After two unsuccessful years with Villa, he joined Leicester City in 2000 where he saw a brief career resurgence under Martin O'Neill, but struggled under his successor Peter Taylor and was sold to Bradford City in December 2000, but would leave the club after just 10 weeks due to his high wage bill. He then joined Real Oviedo of the Primera Liga, where he finished his career in March 2001 after just five weeks with the club. While a talented and prolific goalscorer, Collymore's career was oftentimes marred by controversy, including his public struggles with mental health, outbursts on the pitch and arguments with coaches and teammates. Club career =Early career= Collymore was born in Stone, Staffordshire to a Barbadian father and English mother. He first took an interest in football as a child, and grew up supporting Aston Villa. He started playing soon after as a centre forward for Cannock Peelers and Penkridge Juniors, before starting his professional career as an apprentice with Walsall, and later Wolverhampton Wanderers, before being released and signing for then Conference team, Stafford Rangers. =Crystal Palace (1991‚Äì92)= While playing for Stafford Rangers, Collymore was spotted by a scout from First Division side Crystal Palace and signed with the club on 4 January 1991, when he was 19 years old. He made his first team debut for Palace on 23 April, coming on as a 76th minute substitute in a match against Liverpool. Collymore would remain with Palace for nearly two years, but struggled to find a place in the first team ahead of the prolific goalscoring partnership of Mark Bright and Ian Wright, and left the club in November 1992. =Southend United (1992‚Äì93)= Collymore joined First Division strugglers Southend United for ¬£150,000 on 20 November 1992, as the club was stuck firmly in the second tier relegation battle with the likes of Birmingham, Oxford and Peterborough. Collymore would score 15 goals in 30 league appearances that season, with his goalscoring record and form helping Southend to claw their way out of the bottom three and finish the season in 15th, after being tipped by many to be relegated at the start of the season. Collymore later said \\"I count helping to keep Southend in the First Division in my season there as one of my finest achievements.\\" = Nottingham Forest (1993‚Äì1995) =  First Division (1993‚Äì1994)  Collymore's work at Southend attracted attention from a number of different teams, including boyhood club Aston Villa of the Premiership and newly relegated Nottingham Forest. Frank Clark eventually signed him to the latter on 5 July 1993 for an initial fee of ¬£2.25 million. Collymore's prolific goalscoring form continued with Forest, as he scored 19 goals in 28 games and led the attack as Forest became a fixture in the top of the table and looked to win automatic promotion back to the Premiership. This was realised on 30 April 1994, when a last minute winner from Collymore saw Forest beat Peterborough United 3-2, securing a second place finish and automatic promotion to English football's top flight.  Premiership (1994‚Äì95)  He made his first appearance for Forest in the Premiership on 22 August 1994, scoring a 26th minute equaliser in a 1-1 draw against Manchester United at City Ground. Collymore scored 22 goals as Forest remained a consistent challenger for a top 3 finish in 1994/95, and a thirteen game unbeaten run from February-May saw them finish third and earn a place in the next season's UEFA Cup. Despite success on the field, Collymore became an unpopular figure among his teammates, to the point that they refused to celebrate with him when he scored a goal. Midway through the season, his impressive goalscoring record had attracted attention from Manchester United, who were looking to replace ageing striker Mark Hughes with a younger talent. Collymore spent almost the entirety of late 1994 linked with a move to Old Trafford, with himself and Newcastle United's Andy Cole named as Sir Alex Ferguson‚Äòs most wanted targets. Eventually, Cole was signed by United for an English transfer record deal worth ¬£7 million, while Collymore stayed at Forest for the remainder of the season; by the end of the campaign, however, he had received offers from Liverpool, Everton and Newcastle, with all three battling to earn his signature in the summer of 1995. = Liverpool (1995‚Äì1997) =  1995‚Äì96  Roy Evans would sign the deal to bring Collymore to Liverpool on 3 July 1995 for ¬£8.5 million, shattering the English transfer record set earlier in the year by Andy Cole's move to Manchester United. Collymore was initially placed in a forward partnership with veteran Ian Rush, though Rush was soon replaced with the younger Robbie Fowler early in the season. The up front pairing of Collymore and Fowler proved to be successful, as they scored a combined 55 goals in 1995/96 and established Evans' Liverpool side as serious contenders for that year's Premiership trophy. On 3 April 1996, with the title still very much up for grabs, Liverpool met league leaders Newcastle in a thrilling 4-3 win at Anfield, with Collymore scoring the winner in the second minute of stoppage time to severely weaken Newcastle's grip on first place and eventually play a part in them falling to second as Manchester United would take the trophy on the final day. This was later voted as the best match of the decade by the Premier League in 2003. Along with a strong league finish, Collymore was part of the Liverpool side that reached the 1996 FA Cup Final, played against Manchester United on 11 May 1996. Though he started the game, Collymore failed to get on the scoresheet and was subbed off in the 74th minute for Ian Rush, in what went on to be Rush's final appearance for the club. Collymore watched from the sidelines as Eric Cantona fired home the winning goal with five minutes left on the clock, consigning Liverpool to another year with no major silverware. It would be the closest that Collymore would come to winning a major trophy in his playing career.  1996‚Äì97  Expectations were high for Liverpool and the Collymore/Fowler partnership the following season after the promise they had showed in the previous campaign. Roy Evans' exciting young squad led the league for much of the first half of the season, but a series of poor performances in early 1997 saw them fall behind winners Manchester United and eventually finish 4th. Collymore was again a regular fixture in the attack and was a consistent goalscorer and creator, but became the subject of increasing media scrutiny throughout the season, with tabloids accusing him and most of his teammates of being unprofessional, with the squad being dubbed the \\"Spice Boys\\" by newspapers in 1997.https://web.archive.org/web/20120227131530/http://fourfourtwo.com/blogs/rockngoal/archive/2009/04/22/how- football-became-the-new-rock-n-roll.aspx He eventually fell out of favour with Evans, and was gradually replaced with the up-and-coming Michael Owen towards the end of the season. As his starts for Liverpool became more sporadic, rumours of his departure from Anfield began to circulate prior to the summer. = Aston Villa (1997‚Äì2000) =  1997‚Äì98  Rumours of his exit from Liverpool were confirmed on 16 May 1997 when Collymore was signed by boyhood club Aston Villa for a club record ¬£7 million. Collymore debuted for the Villans on 9 August 1997 in a 1-0 loss to Leicester City. He scored his first club goal on 27 August, in a 3-2 loss against Tottenham. On 4 October, he was sent off after getting into a fistfight with Bolton Wanderers' Andy Todd and subsequently handed a three match ban by the F.A. His debut season for Villa coincided with a major dip in form, as well as injury and disciplinary problems, as he managed just 6 goals all season and struggled to break into the starting lineup ahead of longtime main striker Dwight Yorke. During a match against Liverpool on 28 February 1998, Collymore accused former teammate Steve Harkness of racist abuse, an incident that was later picked up by the Professional Footballer's Association (PFA), but went unresolved and was closed after both players met in private and agreed to move on without charges. Off the field, Collymore was involved in an incident on 9 June 1998 where he assaulted girlfriend Ulrika Jonsson in a Paris bar, which he later apologised for.  1998‚Äì99  The 1998‚Äì99 season saw Collymore score just once in 19 appearances, as his issues off the field came to a head. In a match against Liverpool on 20 November 1998, Collymore was given a yellow card for a 9th minute tackle on defender Steve Harkness that caused the latter to be carried off the pitch and suffer ligament damage; Collymore was later shown a second yellow and sent off for another rash challenge on Michael Owen. Given his history with Harkness, Collymore was accused of holding a grudge and purposely trying to injure his former teammate; he denied the allegations. Shortly after this, he began to publicly struggle with his mental health, and was diagnosed with clinical depression, stress and anxiety in January 1999. Following this, he announced he would seek counselling and checked himself into the Priory Group Hospital in Roehampton, where he stayed for several weeks. He returned to the Villa side later in the season, but after a 3-0 loss to Chelsea on 21 March 1999, manager John Gregory dropped him from the first team for the rest of the season. This would go on to be his last appearance for Aston Villa. = Fulham (1999) = After a summer move to Greek side Panathinaikos failed to materialise, Collymore was sent out on a three month loan to Fulham at the start of the 1999-00 season, with an option for the club to sign him for ¬£1 million at the end. While he failed to make a major impact and was not signed, he did score the winner in a 2-1 League Cup win over West Bromwich Albion on 12 October 1999. = Leicester (2000) =  1999‚Äì00  Collymore and Aston Villa mutually agreed to separate after he returned from his loan spell at Fulham, and he spent the rest of 1999 training with the youth team and looking for a new club. Ligue 1 outfit Montpellier HSC showed interest, but rescinded their offer after Collymore refused to play in a practice match before signing. Newly promoted Bradford City also tried and failed to sign him, put off by Villa's ¬£3 million asking price. He eventually joined Leicester City for free on a pay-as-you-play basis on 11 February 2000. Just days after signing for the club, he made front page news during a team break in Spain, when he set off a fire extinguisher during a night of drinking inside La Manga Club, which resulted in ¬£700 of damage to the bar and the entire team being sent home. Collymore was fined ¬£30,000 and ordered to undertake community work by boss Martin O'Neill for the incident; O'Neill also warned Collymore that he would terminate his contract if any more incidents like this would occur.https://web.archive.org/web/20141023222414/http://www.leicestermercury.co.uk/Friday- Interview-couldn-t-believe-fuss-La-Manga-trip-says-Stan- Collymore/story-12036248-detail/story.htmlhttps://www.theguardian.com/football/2000/feb/18/newsstory.sport5 After returning to England, his second appearance and home debut for the club saw him score a hat-trick in a 5-2 drubbing of Sunderland. He would score 4 times in 6 appearances in his debut campaign for the Foxes, a season that saw them reach the League Cup Final, where they defeated Tranmere Rovers 2-1, though Collymore, having turned out for Fulham earlier in the season, was cup- tied and unable to feature. Collymore was stretchered off the pitch during a game against Derby County on 2 April after just 17 minutes, having audibly screamed and collapsed in the middle of the pitch. Scans later revealed he had suffered a broken left leg after an awkward landing, and he missed the rest of the season.  2000‚Äì01  Having fully recovered, Collymore remained with Leicester through the summer transfer window and was thought to be the club's new first choice striker after Emile Heskey had left for Liverpool in the summer; however, with Martin O'Neill having departed Leicester to manage Celtic, he was dropped by replacement manager Peter Taylor in favour of new signing Ade Akinbiyi and instead often bought on as a midfield substitute. He scored once more for the Foxes, in a 2-0 win against Chelsea F.C. at Stamford Bridge on 17 September 2000. On 24 September, during a 1-1 draw against Everton, Collymore was alleged to have \\"stamped on, and later elbowed\\" Paul Gascoigne. While referee Alan Wiley claimed he did not see the incident and Collymore wasn‚Äôt punished during the game, he was later ordered to attend a disciplinary hearing by the Football Association (F.A.) on 28 November. Two days after the incident with Gascoigne, Collymore submitted a transfer request to Leicester.https://www.theguardian.com/football/2000/sep/26/newsstory.sport4 He would later retract this request, but manager Peter Taylor still placed him on the transfer list, citing Collymore's poor fitness, lack of commitment and attitude problems.https://www.theguardian.com/football/2000/sep/27/newsstory.sport1https://www.theguardian.com/football/2000/sep/27/newsstory.sport7 Having fallen out of favour with another manager, and demoted to the reserve squad, where he was involved in a half time altercation with teammate Trevor Benjamin,https://www.theguardian.com/football/2000/oct/18/newsstory.sport6https://www.theguardian.com/football/2000/oct/17/newsstory.sport4 Collymore and Leicester would eventually agree to part ways, and he was allowed to leave on a free transfer in October 2000.https://www.theguardian.com/football/2000/sep/27/newsstory.sport1 = Bradford City (2000‚Äì2001) = Collymore was immediately signed by longtime admirers Bradford City on 26 October 2000, a move described as \\"desperate\\" by BBC Sport pundit Mark Lawrenson. He made his Bradford debut in a West Yorkshire derby against Leeds United at Valley Parade on 29 October, scoring a memorable overhead kick in a 1-1 draw, however, his controversial celebration in front of the away crowd caused uproar and led to two Leeds fans being restrained by stewards. Collymore subsequently faced additional charges from the F.A. for the incident.https://www.theguardian.com/football/2000/oct/31/newsstory.bradford He was substituted at half-time in his second game as Bradford lost 4‚Äì3 to Newcastle United in the League Cup, and missed the following game at Charlton Athletic because of flu and a sore wisdom tooth. In Collymore's absence, City lost 2‚Äì0, and manager Chris Hutchings was sacked two days later. Jim Jefferies soon took over as new City manager, and Collymore once again lead the front line in Jefferies' first home game in charge against Coventry City, scoring Bradford's first goal. On 28 November, he attended a disciplinary hearing for the incident with Paul Gascoigne while he was still at Leicester, and upon video review of the incident, he was handed a three match ban, which meant he would miss key games against Liverpool, Sunderland and Chelsea. After returning from his ban, Collymore, and other highly paid players Benito Carbone and Dan Petrescu were transfer-listed in January of 2001 by chairman Geoffrey Richmond in a bid to reduce the club's high wage bill. VFB Stuttgart and Celtic both made offers for Collymore, but he would eventually choose to sign with Spanish outfit Real Oviedo after just 8 games and 10 weeks with Bradford.https://www.theguardian.com/football/2001/jan/08/newsstory.bradfordhttps://www.theguardian.com/football/2001/jan/18/newsstory.sport2 = Real Oviedo (2001) = Collymore signed an 18 month contract with Primera Liga side Real Oviedo on 31 January 2001. He made his debut for Oviedo as a second-half substitute in a 1-0 defeat to Las Palmas on 4 February 2001. He was again brought on during the second half of his home debut a week later in a loss against Villarreal, but was dropped by coach Radomir Antiƒá after the game and told to improve his fitness. He played just one more game for Oviedo, another loss against Celta Vigo on 3 March, before announcing his retirement on 7 March 2001 at the age of 30, just five weeks after he had joined Oviedo; he did not tell the club of his plans beforehand and they only found out through the Spanish tabloids. A statement issued through his spokesman said, \\"Stan Collymore has decided, after discussions with his family and close friends, to give up playing professional football. He has just turned 30 and believes that the time is right to explore other career opportunities which are available to him.\\" He was offered a chance to return to Southend United and was also approached by Boston United and Wolverhampton Wanderers, but never made a return to football, however, he applied but was turned down for the manager's position at Bradford City following the dismissal of Jim Jefferies in December 2001. Before the end of the year, Oviedo had began court proceedings against Collymore for breach of his contract, unsuccessfully suing him for ¬£7 million. International career After an impressive debut season in the Premier League, Collymore was called up to Terry Venables' England squad for the Umbro Cup in June 1995. He made his d√©but at Wembley Stadium against Japan, partnering Alan Shearer in a 2‚Äì1 win. He won his second cap as a 90th minute substitute against Brazil. Collymore made his third and final appearance for England as a substitute in a 4‚Äì0 win over Moldova during qualification for the 1998 FIFA World Cup. Post-football career Collymore contributed to his biography Stan: Tackling my demons with Oliver Holt. In 2005, he played the character Kevin Franks in the film Basic Instinct 2 alongside Sharon Stone. On 20 October 2008, Collymore won more than ¬£1.5 million in damages from his financial advisers, for the poor investment advice he had been given since retiring from professional football in 2001. The judge ruled that Collymore had been given advice that was in breach of statutory obligations. Personal life Collymore has talked openly about his mental health issues. He began to seek counselling after he was diagnosed with clinical depression, stress and anxiety in 1999 while playing for Aston Villa. He also stated in his autobiography that he has been diagnosed with borderline personality disorder. Since retiring, he has continued to struggle with depression, and uses his Twitter account to raise awareness of the condition. He is a supporter of Republic, a campaign group that campaigns for an elected UK head of state. He supported the Labour Party before leaving them for the Scottish National Party in December 2015 after a notable minority of Labour MPs supported airstrikes in Syria. = Incidents = In early 1998, Collymore was accused of assault by the mother of his child, Michelle Green; she alleged he had punched her in the face and caused injury after an argument regarding their son on 22 December 1997. Collymore denied the accusations, and was found not guilty and cleared of any charges at a court hearing on 28 April 1998.http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/uk/84416.stm Around the same time, he was in a relationship with television personality Ulrika Jonsson, which ended after he assaulted her in a Paris bar on 9 June 1998. He later apologised for the incident. Collymore made front page news in February 2000 while playing for Leicester City, when, during a team break in Spain, he set off a fire extinguisher during a night of drinking inside La Manga Club which resulted in the entire team being sent home and banned from the resort. Collymore was fined ¬£30,000 and ordered to undertake community work by boss Martin O'Neill for the incident. Later, in December 2000, while playing for Bradford City, Collymore suffered a broken nose after he was assaulted by two men in a Birmingham nightclub. He was subsequently cautioned by manager Jim Jefferies.http://news.bbc.co.uk/sport1/hi/front_page/1207714.stmhttps://www.theguardian.com/football/2000/dec/06/newsstory.bradford In 2004, Collymore was accused of taking part in dogging at Cannock Chase by an undercover News of the World reporter. He lost his job at BBC Radio 5 Live over the incident.

Aerarium populi Romani  The treasury contained the monies and accounts of the state finances. It also held the standards of the legions; the public laws engraved on brass, the decrees of the Senate and other papers and registers of importance. These public treasures were deposited in the temple of Saturn at the Forum Romanum, on the eastern slope of the Capitoline Hill. During the republic, they were in the charge of the urban quaestors, under the supervision and control of the Senate. This arrangement continued (except for the year 43 BC, when no quaestors were chosen) until 28 BC, when Augustus transferred the aerarium to two praefecti aerarii, chosen annually by the Senate from ex-praetors. In 23 these were replaced by two praetors (praetores aerarii or ad aerarium), selected by lot during their term of office. Claudius in 44 restored the quaestors, but had them nominated by the emperor for three years. In 56, Nero substituted two ex-praetors selected under the same conditions.  Aerarium sanctius  In addition to the common treasury, supported by the general taxes and charged with the ordinary expenditure, there was a special reserve fund, also in the temple of Saturn, the aerarium sanctum (or sanctius). This fund probably originally consisted of the spoils of war. Afterwards it was maintained chiefly by a 5% tax on the value of all manumitted slaves. This source of revenue was established by a lex Manlia in 357. This fund was not to be touched except in cases of extreme necessity. Under the emperors, the Senate continued to have at least the nominal management of the aerarium, while the emperor had a separate exchequer, called fiscus. However, after a time, as the power of the emperors increased and their jurisdiction extended until the Senate existed only in form and name, this distinction virtually ceased.  Aerarium militare  Besides creating the fiscus, Augustus also established in AD 6 a military treasury (aerarium militare) as a fund for veterans' retirement benefits. It was largely endowed by the emperor himself and supported by the proceeds of new taxes, an inheritance tax and a sales tax on auctions. Its administration was in the hands of three praefecti aerarii militaris. At first these were appointed by lot, but afterwards by the emperor, from senators of praetorian rank, for three years.  Tribuni aerarii  The tribuni aerarii (\\"tribunes of the treasury\\") have been the subject of much discussion. They are supposed by some to be identical with the curatores tribuum, and to have been the officials who, under the Servian organization, levied the war-tax (tributum) in the tribes and the poll-tax on the aerarii. They also acted as paymasters of the equites and of the soldiers on service in each tribe. By the lex Aurelia (70 BC) the list of judices was composed, in addition to senators and equites, of tribuni aerarii. Whether these were the successors of the above, or a new order closely connected with the equites, or even the same as the latter, is uncertain. According to Theodor Mommsen, they were persons who possessed the equestrian census, but no public horse. They were removed from the list of judices by Julius Caesar, but replaced by Augustus. According to Madvig, the original tribuni aerarii were not officials at all, but private individuals of considerable means, quite distinct from the curatores tribuum, who undertook certain financial work connected with their own tribes. Then, as in the case of the equites, the term was subsequently extended to include all those who possessed the property qualification that would have entitled them to serve as tribuni aerarii. Publicum Prior to the decemvirate in 451 BC, there was a separate institution known as the publicum. On a number of occasions it is recorded that various patricians incurred the anger of the plebs by paying the spoils from war into the publicum rather than the aerarium, for example Quintus Fabius Vibulanus in 485 BC following a victory over the Volsci and Aequi.Livy, Ab urbe condita, 2.42 From this it has been argued that the publicum was a fund administered by the patricians,Barthold Georg Niebuhr, Roman History, II, p.25 but this has been disputed by others.Albert Schwegler, R√∂mische Geschichte, II, 286 References External links *Aerarium (article in Smith's Dictionary of Greek and Roman Antiquities) Category:Economy of ancient Rome Category:Government of the Roman Empire Category:Economic history of Italy ","title":"Aerarium"},{"id":"1245062","text":"Edwin Charles Tubb (15 October 1919 ‚Äì 10 September 2010), also known as E. C. Tubb, was a British writer of science fiction, fantasy and western novels. The author of over 140 novels and 230 short stories and novellas, Tubb is best known for The Dumarest Saga (US collective title: Dumarest of Terra), an epic science-fiction saga set in the far future. Michael Moorcock wrote, \\"His reputation for fast-moving and colourful SF writing is unmatched by anyone in Britain.\\"Cover blurb on 2002 Wildside Press edition of Tubb's The Winds of Gath Much of Tubb's work was written under pseudonyms including Gregory Kern, Carl Maddox, Alan Guthrie, Eric Storm and George Holt. He used 58 pen names over five decades of writing, although some of these were publishers' house names also used by other writers: Volsted Gridban (along with John Russell Fearn), Gill Hunt (with John Brunner and Dennis Hughes), King Lang (with George Hay and John W Jennison), Roy Sheldon (with H. J. Campbell) and Brian Shaw. Tubb's Charles Grey alias was solely his own and acquired a big following in the early 1950s.Encyclopedia of Science Fiction (ed. Robert Holdstock), 1978, Octopus Books, London - Life Tubb was born in London and resided there until his death in 2010. He married Iris Kathleen Smith in 1944 and is survived by their two daughters, Jennifer and Linda, three grandsons, John Barham, Alan Barham and Steven, and two granddaughters, Lisa Elcomb and Julie Hickmott. Career An avid reader of pulp science-fiction and fantasy in his youth, in 1938 Tubb made contact with other British fans and made his first attempts at writing in the genre. \\"My first attempts were written for my own pleasure,\\" he later told New Worlds, \\"and they are now perfect examples of what not to do\\". Tubb found that he had a particular talent as a writer of stories in that genre when his short story \\"No Short Cuts\\" was published in New Worlds magazine in 1951. Previously a salesman of printing machinery,\\"New Worlds Profile: E. C. Tubb\\", New Worlds, March 1953 he opted for a full-time career as a writer and soon became renowned for the speed and diversity of his output. Tubb contributed to many of the science fiction magazines of the 1950s including Futuristic Science Stories, Science Fantasy, Nebula. and Galaxy Science Fiction. He contributed heavily to Authentic Science Fiction, editing the magazine for nearly two years from February 1956 until it folded in October 1957. During this time he found it so difficult to find good writers to contribute to the magazine that he often wrote most of the stories himself under a variety of pseudonyms: one issue of Authentic was written entirely by Tubb, including the letters column. His main work in the science fiction genre, the Dumarest series, appeared from 1967 to 1985, with two final volumes in 1997 and 2008. His second major series, the Cap Kennedy series, was written from 1973 to 1983. Later in life Tubb updated many of his 1950s science fiction novels for 21st century readers. Tubb was one of the co-founders of the British Science Fiction Association. Honors Tubb was Guest of Honour at Heicon, the 1970 World Science Fiction Convention, in Heidelberg, Germany. He was a five-time winner of the Nebula Science Fiction Magazine Literary Award (1953‚Äì1958) and the recipient of the 1955 Cytricon Literary Award for Best British SF Writer. His short story \\"Lucifer!\\" won the Europa Prize in 1972. In 2010, his novel The Possessed (2005, revised version of Touch of Evil [1959]) won the Premio Italia Award for Best International Novel. Works =The Dumarest saga= Tubb's best known series is The Dumarest Saga (US collective title: Dumarest of Terra), a far future epic science-fiction saga charting the adventures of traveler Earl Dumarest as he attempts to find his way back to his home planet, Earth, from a region of space so far distant that the existence of the planet is believed to be nothing more than a myth. Originally written in what Michael Moorcock has described as a \\"conscious and acknowledged imitation\\" of Leigh Brackett's Eric John Stark stories, the series subsequently developed a style of storytelling unique to Tubb. Published over a span of more than 40 years, the Dumarest Saga comprised 33 novels. The 33rd, which brings closure to Dumarest's search for Earth, was published in 2008 by Homeworld Press of Chicago. A pair of Dumarest short stories, entitled \\"Child of Earth\\" and \\"Figona\\" and published in the science fiction anthologies Fantasy Adventures 1 (2002) and Fantasy Adventures 2 (2003), were extracts from this longer work. =Cap Kennedy series= Tubb's other main novel series, Cap Kennedy, is space opera in the style of Perry Rhodan. Known as F.A.T.E. in the UK (where only the first six books have ever been published), the novels follow the adventures of Captain 'Cap' Kennedy, a Free Acting Terran Envoy (F.A.T.E.) with licence to act as judge, jury, and executioner, and the power to intervene in any situation which threatens the peace of the Terran Sphere, an interplanetary federation centred on Earth. Independently wealthy and operating from his personal spaceship, the Mordain, Kennedy is assisted on his missions by engineer Penza Saratov, veteran scientist Professor Jarl Luden, and alien navigator Veem Chemile, a humanoid chameleon who claims to be descended from the Zheltyana, an ancient race which dominated the galaxy in the distant past before vanishing without trace. The discovery of mysterious artifacts left behind by the Zheltyana on different worlds often provided the spring-board for the stories in the series. Lester del Rey found that although the first volume managed to \\"avoid the primitiveness and the formula\\" that spoiled many similar series, the virtues of such series were also missing, leaving him unenthusiastic.\\"Reading Room\\", If, February 1974, p.132 He later noted improvement in a subsequent installment.\\"Reading Room\\", If, April 1974, p.40 Tubb wrote 17 Cap Kennedy novels, all under the pseudonym Gregory Kern. These books were the basis for the Commander Scott series from German publishers Bastei. This series included all of the Cap Kennedy books by Tubb as well as a number of further novels, written under pseudonym by different German authors. Published in the format of romanheft (a digest-sized version of pulp magazines), the series lasted for 42 issues from 1975 to 1976. (See the entry under the German Wikipedia, Commander Scott.) =Space 1999 series= Tubb was the author of six novels based on Gerry Anderson's 1975 science fiction television series Space: 1999. Breakaway (1975), Collision Course (1975) and Earthbound (2003) are novelizations of 11 scripts written for the series' first season format (including two that were subsequently filmed as second-season episodes), while Alien Seed (1976), Rogue Planet (1976) and Earthfall (1977, revised 2002) are original novels set within the first season continuity. The latter rejected the format changes of the TV series' second season to provide a satisfactory conclusion to the Space 1999 story. Tubb's short story \\"Random Sample\\" from New Writings in SF 29 (1976) was revised to become \\"Dead End\\", a short story in the Space: 1999 anthology Shepherd Moon (2010). The original story's Prometheus starship crew are replaced by the Moonbase Alpha characters in the Space: 1999 version. \\"Random Sample\\" was itself a revised version of a much earlier Tubb short, \\"Entrance Exam\\", originally published in New Worlds magazine (1951). =Other science fiction= Tubb's best known standalone novel is The Space-Born (1956), which started life as a serial for New Worlds Science Fiction magazine entitled \\"Star Ship\\". An acknowledged masterpiece of the \\"generational starship\\" story, the book tells of a society who are the sixteenth generation of the original crew of a vast starship on a 300-year journey to Pollux from Earth. The plot centres on a protagonist whose job is to eliminate anyone who has become a burden to the society, through ill health, mental instability, or anyone over 40. Other notable standalone novels include Alien Dust (1955), which charts the first 35 years of an Earth colony on Mars, and Moon Base (1964), a science fiction detective thriller set on a British Moonbase where a biochemical computer is under development. The short story collections Ten From Tomorrow (1966), A Scatter of Stardust (1972) and The Best Science Fiction of E.C. Tubb (2003) contain the best of Tubb's short form writing, including \\"The Last Day of Summer\\" (1955), \\"Little Girl Lost\\" (1955), \\"Vigil\\" (1956), \\"The Bells of Acheron\\" (1957), \\"Fresh Guy\\" (1958), \\"The Ming Vase\\" (1963), \\"J is for Jeanne\\" (1965), and \\"Evane\\" (1973). =Other genres= Outside the field of science fiction, Tubb wrote 11 western novels, a detective novel and a Foreign Legion novel for Badger Books. Once again, many of these were published under a variety of pseudonyms, including the house name \\"Chuck Adams\\", which were also used by other authors. In the 1970s he wrote a trilogy of historical novels set in Ancient Rome under the pseudonym Edward Thomson. =Dramatisations= Tubb's 1955 novel The Space- Born was dramatised for French television in 1962 as a 90-minute play for Radiodiffusion-T√©l√©vision Fran√ßaise. The production was directed by Alain Boudet from a script by Michael Subrela and broadcast on 11 December 1962. The short story \\"Little Girl Lost\\", originally published in New Worlds magazine (1955), was dramatised as a segment of Night Gallery in 1972. Adapted by Stanford Whitmore and directed by Timothy Galfras, with a cast featuring William Windom and Ed Nelson, the segment originally aired on 1 March 1972, paired with The Caterpillar in the penultimate episode of the series' second season.

Eliot served in diplomatic posts in Russia (1885), Morocco (1892), Turkey (1893), and Washington, D.C. (1899). He also served as British Commissioner in Samoa. He was appointed a Companion of the Order of the Bath (CB) in the 1898 Birthday Honours and was knighted as a Knight Commander of the Order of St Michael and St George (KCMG) in the New Year honours list 1 January 1900. =British East Africa= In 1900, he was appointed commissioner of British East Africa, and on 1 January 1902 he was appointed Commissioner, Commander-in-Chief and Consul-General for the East Africa Protectorate, including the mainland dominions of the Sultan of Zanzibar, and also as British Agent and Consul-General for the island dominions of the Sultan. In April 1902, the first application for land in British East Africa was made by the East Africa Syndicate ‚Äì a company in which financiers belonging to the British South Africa Company were interested ‚Äì which sought a grant of sq. m., and this was followed by other applications for considerable areas, a scheme being also propounded for a large Jewish settlement (which was rejected by the world Jewish community). During 1903 the arrival of hundreds of prospective settlers, chiefly from South Africa, led to the decision to entertain no more applications for large areas of land, especially as questions were raised concerning the preservation for the Maasai of their rights of pasturage. In April 1903, Major Frederick Russell Burnham, the famous American scout and then a Director of the East African Syndicate, sent an expedition consisting of John Weston Brooke, John Charles Blick, Mr. Bittlebank, and Mr. Brown, to assess the mineral wealth of the region. The party, known as the \\"Four B.'s\\", travelled from Nairobi via Mount Elgon northwards to the western shores of Lake Rudolph, experiencing plenty of privations from want of water, and of the danger from encounters with the Maasai.Fergusson, W.N. (1911). Adventure, Sport and Travel on the Tibetan Steppes, p. preface. Charles Scribner's Sons, New York In the carrying out of this policy of colonisation a dispute arose between Eliot and Lord Lansdowne, the British Foreign Secretary. Lansdowne, believing himself bound by pledges given to the East Africa Syndicate, decided that they should be granted the lease of the they had applied for; but after consulting officials of the protectorate then in London, he refused Eliot permission to conclude leases for each to two applicants from South Africa. Eliot thereupon resigned his post, and in a public telegram to the prime minister, dated Mombasa, 21 June 1904, gave as his reason:- \\"Lord Lansdowne ordered me to refuse grants of land to certain private persons while giving a monopoly of land on unduly advantageous terms to the East Africa Syndicate. I have refused to execute these instructions, which I consider unjust and impolitic.\\" On the day Sir Charles sent this telegram the appointment of Sir Donald William Stewart, the chief commissioner of Ashanti (Ghana), to succeed him was announced. =University administration= In 1905 Eliot was the first Vice-Chancellor of the newly created University of Sheffield until 1912 when he was appointed the first Vice-Chancellor of the University of Hong Kong; he served there until 1918 when he was recalled to the diplomatic service becoming high commissioner and consul-general in Siberia.Oxford Dictionary of National Biography, accessed 6 August 2011 =Japan= He was the British Ambassador to Japan in 1920‚Äì1926: though the position was not renewed, he stayed in Japan, studying the practice of Buddhism there. He regretted the 1921 decision to end the Anglo-Japanese alliance in 1923. Taken ill with influenza, he decided to return to England, but died on the journey on 16 March 1931 and was buried at sea in the Straits of Malacca. He never married.

Matthias Merian in Danckerts Historis, 1642. Hakkapeliitta (Finnish pl. hakkapeliitat) is a historiographical term used for a Finnish light cavalryman in the service of King Gustavus Adolphus of Sweden during the Thirty Years' War (1618 to 1648). Hakkapeliitta is a 19th-century Finnish modification of a contemporary name given by foreigners in the Holy Roman Empire and variously spelled as Hackapelit, Hackapelite, Hackapell, Haccapelit, or Haccapelite. These terms were based on a Finnish battle cry hakkaa p√§√§lle (; ), commonly translated as \\"Cut them down!\\" The hakkapeliitta-style cavalry was first used during the Polish-Swedish Wars of the late 16th century. In the early 17th century the cavalry led by the Field Marshal Jacob De la Gardie participated in campaigns against Poland and Russia. The Hakkapeliitta cavalry men led by Field Marshal Gustaf Horn were vital to the Swedish victories in Germany during the Thirty Years' War. The Finnish military march Hakkapeliittain Marssi is named after hakkapeliittas. Tactics The Hakkapeliitta were well-trained Finnish light cavalrymen who excelled in sudden and savage attacks, raiding and reconnaissance. The greatest advantage of the fast and lightly armored Hakkapeliitta cavalry was its charge. They typically had a sword, a helmet, and leather armor or a breastplate of steel. They would attack at a full gallop, fire the first pistol at twenty paces and the second at five paces, and then draw the sword. The horse itself was used like another weapon, as it was used to trample enemy infantry. The horses used by the Hakkapeliitta were the ancestors of the modern Finnhorse; they were strong and durable.  Organization  The Swedish army then had three cavalry regiments from Finland: *Nyland and Tavastehus County Cavalry Regiment (Swedish: Nylands och Tavastehus l√§ns kavalleriregemente) *√Öbo and Bj√∂rneborg County Cavalry Regiment (√Öbo och Bj√∂rneborgs l√§ns kavalleriregemente) *Viborg and Nyslott County Cavalry Regiment (Viborgs och Nyslotts l√§ns kavalleriregemente) Their most famous commander was Torsten St√•lhandske (surname meaning \\"steelglove\\"), who was commissioned as a lieutenant-colonel with the Nyland and Tavastehus Cavalry Regiment in 1629 and led it for the first time in the Thirty Years' War. The original provincial regiments (landskapsregementen) had been raised by splitting the old Grand regiments (Storregementen, also \\"Land regiments\\" (landsregementen), organized by Gustavus Adolphus at the end of the 1610s, forming 21 infantry and eight cavalry regiments as written in the Swedish constitution of 1634.  Notable battles  battle of L√ºtzen battle of N√∂rdlingen The main battles in which the Hakkapeliitta took part during the Thirty Years' War were: *Breitenfeld in 1631 *Lech in 1632 *L√ºtzen in 1632 *N√∂rdlingen in 1634 *Leipzig in 1642 (also known as the Second Battle of Breitenfeld or the First Battle of Leipzig) *Jankau in 1645 *Lens in 1648 200 Hakkapeliitta were also part of the army which King Karl X Gustav of Sweden led across the frozen Danish straits in the winter of 1658, which enabled him to conquer Sk√•neland from Denmark in the Treaty of Roskilde. Many Finnish soldiers served under the Swedish Empire. During the era of the Swedish Empire of the 17th century, the Finnish cavalry was constantly used in Germany, Bohemia, Poland and Denmark. Parts of the cavalry were stationed in Estonia and Livonia.Talaskivi 1977, pages 77-81 In popular culture * The Bearkillers, a protagonist faction in S.M.

He is widely regarded as the founder of the modern, academic study of Kabbalah. He was the first professor of Jewish Mysticism at Hebrew University of Jerusalem.Magid, Shaul, \\"Gershom Scholem\\", Stanford Encyclopedia of Philosophy (Spring 2009 Edition), Edward N. Zalta (ed.), URL = . His close friends included Walter Benjamin and Leo Strauss, and selected letters from his correspondence with those philosophers have been published. Scholem is best known for his collection of lectures, Major Trends in Jewish Mysticism (1941) and for his biography Sabbatai Zevi, the Mystical Messiah (1957). His collected speeches and essays, published as On Kabbalah and its Symbolism (1965), helped to spread knowledge of Jewish mysticism among both Jews and non-Jews. Biography Gershom Scholem sitting in Sukka studying the Zohar, 1925 Gerhard (Gershom) Scholem was born in Berlin to Arthur Scholem and Betty Hirsch Scholem. His father was a printer. He studied Hebrew and Talmud with an Orthodox rabbi. Scholem met Walter Benjamin in Munich in 1915, when the former was seventeen years old and the latter was twenty-three. They began a lifelong friendship that ended when Benjamin committed suicide in 1940 in the wake of Nazi persecution. Scholem dedicated his book Major Trends in Jewish Mysticism (Die j√ºdische Mystik in ihren Hauptstr√∂mungen), based on lectures 1938-1957, to Benjamin. In 1915 Scholem enrolled at the Frederick William University in Berlin (today, Humboldt University), where he studied mathematics, philosophy, and Hebrew. There he met Martin Buber, Shmuel Yosef Agnon, Hayim Nahman Bialik, Ahad Ha'am, and Zalman Shazar. In Berlin, Scholem befriended Leo Strauss and corresponded with him throughout his life.Green, Kenneth Hart (1997). \\"Leo Strauss as a Modern Jewish Thinker\\" [editor's introduction], in: Leo Strauss, Jewish Philosophy and the Crisis of Modernity, ed. Green. Albany: State University of New York Press. . p. 55. He studied mathematical logic at the University of Jena under Gottlob Frege. He was in Bern in 1918 with Benjamin when he met Elsa (Escha) Burchhard, who became his first wife. Scholem returned to Germany in 1919, where he received a degree in semitic languages at the Ludwig Maximilian University of Munich. Together with Benjamin he established a fictitious school - the University of Muri. Scholem wrote his doctoral thesis on the oldest known kabbalistic text, Sefer ha-Bahir. Drawn to Zionism and influenced by Buber, he immigrated in 1923 to the British Mandate of Palestine.The Cult Following of Gershom Scholem, Founder of Modern Kabbala Research, Haaretz He became a librarian, and eventually head of the Department of Hebrew and Judaica at the National Library. Scholem's brother Werner was a member of the ultra-left \\"Fischer-Maslow Group\\" and the youngest ever member of the Reichstag, representing the Communist Party (KPD) in the German parliament. He was expelled from the party and later murdered by the Nazis during the Third Reich. Gershom Scholem, unlike his brother, was vehemently opposed to both Communism and Marxism. In 1936, he married his second wife, Fania Freud. Scholem died in Jerusalem, where he is buried next to his wife in the Sanhedria Cemetery. J√ºrgen Habermas delivered the eulogy. Academic career He became a lecturer at the Hebrew University of Jerusalem. Scholem taught the Kabbalah and mysticism from a scientific point of view and became the first professor of Jewish mysticism at the university in 1933, working in this post until his retirement in 1965, when he became an emeritus professor. Card catalogue which Gershom Scholem used to write his notes Gershom Scholem house, Abarbanel st. 28, Jerusalem Scholem directly contrasted his historiographical approach on the study of Jewish mysticism with the approach of the 19th- century school of the Wissenschaft des Judentums (\\"Science of Judaism\\"), which sought to submit the study of Judaism to the discipline of subjects such as history, philology, and philosophy. According to Jeremy Adler, Scholem's thinking was \\"both recognizably Jewish and deeply German,\\" and \\"changed the course of twentieth-century European thought.\\"Times Literary Supplement, 10th April 2015 Jewish mysticism was seen as Judaism's weakest scholarly link. Scholem told the story of his early research when he was directed to a prominent rabbi who was an expert on Kabbalah. Seeing the rabbi's many books on the subject, Scholem asked about them, only to be told: \\"This trash? Why would I waste my time reading nonsense like this?\\" (Robinson 2000, p. 396) The analysis of Judaism carried out by the Wissenschaft school was flawed in two ways, according to Scholem: It studied Judaism as a dead object rather than as a living organism; and it did not consider the proper foundations of Judaism, the non-rational force that, in Scholem's view, made the religion a living thing. In Scholem's opinion, the mythical and mystical components were at least as important as the rational ones, and he thought that they, rather than the minutiae of Halakha, were the truly living core of Judaism. In particular, he disagreed with what he considered to be Martin Buber's personalization of Kabbalistic concepts as well as what he argued was an inadequate approach to Jewish history, Hebrew language, and the land of Israel. In the Weltanschauung of Scholem, the research of Jewish mysticism could not be separated from its historical context. Starting from something similar to the Gegengeschichte of Friedrich Nietzsche he ended up including less normative aspects of Judaism in the public history. Specifically, Scholem thought that Jewish history could be divided into three periods: *During the Biblical period, monotheism battles myth, without completely defeating it. *During the Talmudic period, some of the institutions‚Äîfor example, the notion of the magical power of the accomplishment of the Sacraments‚Äîare removed in favour of the purer concept of the divine transcendence. *During the medieval period, the impossibility of reconciling the abstract concept of God of Greek philosophy with the personal God of the Bible, led Jewish thinkers, such as Maimonides, to try to eliminate the remaining myths and to modify the figure of the living God. After this time, mysticism, as an effort to find again the essence of the God of their fathers, became more widespread. The notion of the three periods, with its interactions between rational and irrational elements in Judaism, led Scholem to put forward some controversial arguments. He thought that the 17th century messianic movement, known as Sabbatianism, was developed from the Lurianic Kabbalah. In order to neutralize Sabbatianism, Hasidism had emerged as a Hegelian synthesis. Many of those who joined the Hasidic movement, because they had seen in it an Orthodox congregation, considered it scandalous that their community should be associated with a heretical movement. In the same way, Scholem produced the hypothesis that the source of the 13th century Kabbalah was a Jewish gnosticism that preceded Christian gnosticism. The historiographical approach of Scholem also involved a linguistic theory. In contrast to Buber, Scholem believed in the power of the language to invoke supernatural phenomena. In contrast to Walter Benjamin, he put the Hebrew language in a privileged position with respect to other languages, as the only language capable of revealing the divine truth. Scholem considered the Kabbalists as interpreters of a pre-existent linguistic revelation. Debate with Hannah Arendt In the aftermath of the Eichmann trial in Jerusalem, Scholem sharply criticised Hannah Arendt's book, Eichmann in Jerusalem: A Report on the Banality of Evil and decried her lack of \\"ahavath Yisrael\\" (solidarity with the Jewish people). Arendt responded that she never loved any collective group, and that she does not love the Jewish people but was only part of them. The bitter fight, which was exchanged in various articles, made Scholem break off ties with Arendt and refuse to forgive her. Scholem wrote to Hans Paeschke that he \\"knew Hannah Arendt when she was a socialist or half- communist and...when she was a Zionist. I am astounded by her ability to pronounce upon movements in which she was once so deeply engaged, in terms of a distance measured in light years and from such sovereign heights.\\"Hannah Arendt in Jerusalem, ed. Steven E. Aschheim, 2001, University of California Press, p.9 Various other Israeli and Jewish academics also broke off ties with Arendt, claiming that her lack of solidarity with the Jewish people in their time of need was appalling, along with her victimization of various Nazis. Before the Eichmann trial, Scholem also opposed Arendt's interpretation (in letters and the introduction to Illuminations) of Walter Benjamin as a Marxist thinker who predated the New Left. For Scholem, Benjamin had been an essentially religious thinker, whose turn to Marxism had been merely an unfortunate, but inessential and superficial, expedient. Awards and recognition * In 1958, Scholem was awarded the Israel Prize in Jewish studies. * In 1968, he was elected president of the Israel Academy of Sciences and Humanities. * In 1969, he received the Yakir Yerushalayim (Worthy Citizen of Jerusalem) award.

Early life Although it has been reported that Thomas was born in Nenagh, County Tipperary, it has now been established that he was born in London of Irish ancestry. Thomas joined the British Army as a drummer in the Royal Horse Artillery, but transferred to the 4th (Royal Irish) Dragoon Guards before the outbreak of hostilities. First World War It was while serving as a corporal in the 4th (Royal Irish) Dragoon Guards that Thomas is reported to have fired the first British shot of the First World War. He was promoted to sergeant on 5 November 1915 and transferred to the Machine Gun Corps in 1916. Thomas was also Mentioned in Despatches for bravery. While positioned in a slit trench he advanced on his opposite number after British shelling of the enemy lines, to find all the German soldiers killed. Noting the quality of the German boots, he removed them from several soldiers, tied them together and crawled back to his own lines, where he distributed them amongst his friends. Thomas was awarded the Military Medal during his service. Later life and death Thomas returned to the Royal Irish Dragoons at the end of hostilities and was discharged in 1923. He then became the Commissionnaire at the Duke of Yorks Cinema. While at work in February 1939, Thomas became ill and subsequently died of pneumonia. He was buried with full military honours.

The foundation's goal, through the use of grants, is \\"to improve the health and health care of all Americans.\\" The foundation has $11 billion in assets, generating grants approaching $500 million a year. The Robert Wood Johnson Foundation makes grants for a range of health issues, including access to care, childhood obesity, and training for doctors and nurses. Other topics of interest to the foundation include social and economic factors that can impact health, including quality of housing, violence, poverty, and access to fresh food. History Robert Wood Johnson II built the family firm of Johnson & Johnson into the world's largest health products maker. He died in 1968. He established the foundation at his death with 10,204,377 shares of the company's stock. Leadership The foundation is currently headed by Richard E. Besser, who was named president and CEO in April 2017. Besser succeeded Risa Lavizzo-Mourey, the foundation's president between 2002 and 2017. Lavizzo-Mourey worked to advance its vision of building a Culture of Health, including spearheading efforts to reverse the national childhood obesity epidemic. The foundation committed $1 billion toward eradicating this health problem, dedicating $500 million to the mission in 2007 and another $500 million in 2015. From 1990 to 2002, Steve Schroeder led the foundation. Grantmaking areas These interest areas include: Childhood Obesity: Backing projects that help reverse the childhood obesity epidemic by improving access to affordable, healthy food and providing more opportunities for children to play and exercise in their schools and communities. The Robert Wood Johnson Foundation's grants are focused on driving public policy initiatives and changing community environments. These include programs that encourage supermarkets to return to low-income communities and that improve nutrition, physical activity, and staff wellness in schools nationwide. The foundation partnered with The Food Trust, a non-profit in Philadelphia that helps make fresh, affordable food accessible to the underprivileged and educates children about healthy eating. The Food Trust's research on childhood obesity led the Philadelphia school system to ban soda vending machines from all of its schools, the strongest measure in the country. Healthy Communities: Supporting initiatives that are helping to change conditions in local communities so that residents can reach their greatest health potential. The foundation's grants are focused in investments in housing, transportation, parks and open spaces, disease prevention, life expectancy, and the social, economic, and environmental factors that shape health. Health Insurance Coverage: Supporting policies and initiatives that expand health care coverage and increase enrollment in programs so that anyone in the U.S. can have affordable health care coverage. Health Care Cost, Quality, and Value: Promoting efforts to make high quality care available cost effectively. The foundation funds projects that study the relationships between the cost of care and results, develop ways to cut waste in the health care system, and advance research into how people's health is affected by factors such as education, transportation, income, clean air, and public or business policies. For example, in 2009, the foundation donated $2 million to Health Leads, a national health care organization that works with doctors in participating clinics to \\"prescribe\\" food, fuel assistance, housing vouchers, or other resources for their patients the same way they might prescribe medication. Leadership for Better Health: Supporting projects that help health professionals develop leadership skills, encourage networking between different disciplines, and increase the diversity of people working in health care. Pioneer Portfolio: Making grants to promote approaches to entrenched problems, identify emerging health issues, and build new models for providing care. For example, the foundation gave nearly $5 million to Project ECHO, based at the University of New Mexico Health Sciences Center. ECHO uses online videoconferencing to link primary-care doctors, nurses, and physicians' assistants with specialists to train them to treat and help manage complex conditions, such as hepatitis C and opiate addiction.

As such, his paintings were very fashionable and were sought after by those among the highest strata of the British society. These included figures such as George II of Great Britain, Frederick, Prince of Wales, and the Duke of Marlborough. It is likely that he received artistic training from Jan Wyck before 1700. Wootton may have begun life as a page to the family of the Dukes of Beaufort. His earliest surviving dated work is the equine portrait Bonny Black (1711). He remained active until his death in 1764, based in the capital of English horse racing at Newmarket, and producing large numbers of portraits of horses and also conversation pieces with a hunting or riding setting. He acquired a classicising landscape style based on that of Gaspard Dughet, which he used in some pure landscape paintings, as well as views of country houses and equine subjects. This introduced an alternative to the various Dutch and Flemish artists who had previously set the prevailing landscape style in Britain, and through intermediary artists such as George Lambert, the first British painter to base a career on landscape subjects, was to greatly influence other British artists such as Gainsborough.Waterhouse, 155‚Äì156 He is now somewhat eclipsed in the field of animal paintings by the later George Stubbs (1724‚Äì1806), who is considered technically superior. John Wootton died in London on 13 November 1764. Examples of his animal painting can be found in the Tate Gallery, London, the Virginia Museum of Fine Arts, Richmond, the Yale Center for British Art, in the Elizabethan Great Hall at Longleat and in The Portland Collection at the Harley Gallery and Foundation.

The real-time data it provides is used in climate and oceanographic research.Argo Begins Systematic Global Probing of the Upper Oceans Toni Feder, Phys. Today 53, 50 (2000), A special research interest is to quantify the ocean heat content (OHC). The distribution of active floats in the Argo array, colour coded by country that owns the float, as of February 2018. The Argo fleet consists of almost 4000 drifting \\"Argo floats\\" (as profiling floats used by the Argo program are often called) deployed worldwide. Each float weighs 20‚Äì30 kg. In most cases probes drift at a depth of 1000 metres (the so-called parking depth) and, every 10 days, by changing their buoyancy, dive to a depth of 2000 metres and then move to the sea-surface, measuring conductivity and temperature profiles as well as pressure. From these, salinity and density can be calculated. Seawater density is important in determining large-scale motions in the ocean. Average current velocities at 1000 metres are directly measured by the distance and direction a float drifts while parked at that depth, which is determined by GPS or Argos system positions at the surface. The data are transmitted to shore via satellite, and are freely available to everyone, without restrictions. The Argo program is named after the Greek mythical ship Argo to emphasize the complementary relationship of Argo with the Jason satellite altimeters. Both the standard Argo floats and the 4 satellites launched so far to monitor changing sea-level all operate on a 10-day duty cycle.  International collaboration  The Argo program is a collaborative partnership of more than 30 nations from all continents (most shown on the graphic map in this article) that maintains a global array and provides a dataset anyone can use to explore the ocean environment. Argo is a component of the Global Ocean Observing System (GOOS). and is coordinated by the Argo Steering Team, an international body of scientists and technical experts that meets once per year. The Argo data stream is managed by the Argo Data Management Team. Argo is also supported by the Group on Earth Observations, and has been endorsed since its beginnings by the World Climate Research Programme's CLIVAR Project (Variability and predictability of the ocean-atmosphere system), and by the Global Ocean Data Assimilation Experiment (GODAE OceanView).  History  The distribution of active floats in the Argo array, colour coded by country, that carry bio-geochemical sensors as of February 2018. A program called Argo was first proposed at OceanObs 1999 which was a conference organised by international agencies with the aim of creating a coordinated approach to ocean observations. The original Argo prospectus was created by a small group of scientists, chaired by Dean Roemmich, who described a program that would have a global array of about 3000 floats in place by sometime in 2007. The 3000-float array was achieved in November 2007 and was global. The Argo Steering Team met for the first time in 1999 in Maryland (USA) and outlined the principles of global data sharing. The Argo Steering Team made a 10-year report to OceanObs-2009 and received suggestions on how the array might be improved. These suggestions included enhancing the array at high latitudes, in marginal seas (such as the Gulf of Mexico and the Mediterranean) and along the equator, improved observation of strong boundary currents (such as the Gulf Stream and Kuroshio), extension of observations into deep water and the addition of sensors for monitoring biological and chemical changes in the oceans. In November 2012 an Indian float in the Argo array gathered the one-millionth profile (twice the number collected by research vessels during all of the 20th century) an event that was reported in several press releases. As can be seen in the plot opposite, by early 2018 the Bio-Argo program is expanding rapidly.  Float design and operation  A schematic diagram showing the general structure of a profiling float as used in Argo The critical capability of an Argo float is its ability to rise and descend in the ocean on a programmed schedule. The floats do this by changing their effective density. The density of any object is given by its mass divided by its volume. The Argo float keeps its mass constant, but by altering its volume, it changes its density. To do this, mineral oil is forced out of the float's pressure case and expands a rubber bladder at the bottom end of the float. As the bladder expands, the float becomes less dense than seawater and rises to the surface. Upon finishing its tasks at the surface, the float withdraws the oil and descends again. A handful of companies and organizations manufacture profiling floats used in the Argo program. APEX floats, made by Teledyne Webb Research, are the most common element of the current array. SOLO and SOLO-II floats (the latter use a reciprocating pump for buoyancy changes, unlike screw-driven pistons in other floats) were developed at Scripps Institution of Oceanography. Other types include the NINJA float, made by the Tsurumi Seiki Co. of Japan, and the ARVOR & PROVOR floats developed by IFREMER in France. Most floats use sensors made by Sea-Bird Scientific (https://www.seabird.com/) , which also makes a profiling float called Navis. A typical Argo float is a cylinder just over 1 metre long and 14 cm across with a hemispherical cap. Thus it has a minimum volume of about 16,600 cubic centimetres (cm3). At Ocean Station Papa in the Gulf of Alaska the temperature and salinity at the surface might be about 6 ¬∞C and 32.55 parts per thousand giving a density of sea-water of 1.0256 g/cm3. At a depth of 2000 metres (pressure of 2000 decibars) the temperature might be 2 ¬∞C and the salinity 34.58 parts per thousand. Thus, including the effect of pressure (water is slightly compressible) the density of sea-water is about 1.0369 g/cm3. The change in density divided by the deep density is 0.0109. The float has to match these densities if it is to reach 2000 metres depth and then rise to the surface. Since the density of the float is its mass divided by volume, it needs to change its volume by 0.0109 √ó 16,600 = 181 cm3 to drive that excursion; a small amount of that volume change is provided by the compressibility of the float itself, and excess buoyancy is required at the surface in order to keep the antenna above water. All Argo floats carry sensors to measure the temperature and salinity of the ocean as they vary with depth, but an increasing number of floats also carry other sensors, such as for measuring dissolved oxygen and ultimately other variables of biological and chemical interest such as chlorophyll, nutrients and pH. An extension to the Argo project called BioArgo is being developed and, when implemented, will add a biological and chemical component to this method of sampling the oceans. The antenna for satellite communications is mounted at the top of the float which extends clear of the sea surface after it completes its ascent. The ocean is saline, hence an electrical conductor, so that radio communications from under the sea surface are not possible. Early in the program Argo floats exclusively used slow mono-directional satellite communications but the majority of floats being deployed in mid-2013 use rapid bi-directional communications. The result of this is that Argo floats now transmit much more data than was previously possible and they spend only about 20 minutes on the sea surface rather than 8‚Äì12 hours, greatly reducing problems such as grounding and bio-fouling. The average life span of Argo floats has increased greatly since the program began, first exceeding 4-year mean lifetime for floats deployed in 2005. Ongoing improvements should result in further extensions to 6 years and longer. As of June 2014, new types of floats were being tested to collect measurements much deeper than can be reached by standard Argo floats. These \\"Deep Argo\\" floats are designed to reach depths of 4000 or 6000 metres, versus 2000 metres for standard floats. This will allow a much greater volume of the ocean to be sampled. Such measurements are important for developing a comprehensive understanding of the ocean, such as trends in heat content.  Array design  alt= The original plan advertised in the Argo prospectus called for a nearest-neighbour distance between floats, on average, of 3¬∞ latitude by 3¬∞ longitude. This allowed for higher resolution (in kilometres) at high latitudes, both north and south, and was considered necessary because of the decrease in the Rossby radius of deformation which governs the scale of oceanographic features, such as eddies. By 2007 this was largely achieved, but the target resolution has never yet been completely achieved in the deep southern ocean. Efforts are being made to complete the original plan in all parts of the world oceans but this is difficult in the deep Southern Ocean as deployment opportunities occur only very rarely. As mentioned in the history section, enhancements are now planned in the equatorial regions of the oceans, in boundary currents and in marginal seas. This requires that the total number of floats be increased from the original plan of 3000 floats to a 4000-float array. One consequence of the use of profiling floats to sample the ocean is that seasonal bias can be removed. The diagram opposite shows the count of all float profiles acquired each month by Argo south of 30¬∞S (upper curve) from the start of the program to November 2012 compared with the same diagram for all other data available. The lower curve shows a strong annual bias with four times as many profiles being collected in austral summer than in austral winter. For the upper (Argo) plot, there is no bias apparent.  Data access  A section of salinity along the date line computed from Argo data using the Global Marine Atlas. One of the critical features of the Argo model is that of global and unrestricted access to data in near real-time. When a float transmits a profile it is quickly converted to a format that can be inserted on the Global Telecommunications System (GTS). The GTS is operated by the World Meteorological Organisation, or WMO, specifically for the purpose of sharing data needed for weather forecasting. Thus all nations who are members of the WMO receive all Argo profiles within a few hours of the acquisition of the profile. Data are also made available through ftp and WWW access via two Argo Global Data Centres (or GDACs), one in France and one in the US. About 90% of all profiles acquired are made available to global access within 24 hours, with the remaining profiles becoming available soon thereafter. For a researcher to use data acquired via the GTS or from the Argo Global Data Centres (GDACs) does require programming skills. The GDACs supply multi-profile files that are a native file format for Ocean DataView. For any day there are files with names like 20121106_prof.nc that are called multi-profile files. This example is a file specific to 6 November 2012 and contains all profiles in a single NetCDF file for one ocean basin. The GDACs identify three ocean basins, Atlantic, Indian and Pacific. Thus three multi-profile files will carry every Argo profile acquired on that specific day. A user who wants to explore Argo data but lacks programming skills might like to download the Argo Global Marine Atlas which is an easy-to-use utility that allows the creation of products based on Argo data such as the salinity section shown above, but also horizontal maps of ocean properties, time series at any location etc. This Atlas also carries an \\"update\\" button that allows data to be updated periodically. The Argo Global Marine Atlas is maintained at the Scripps Institution of Oceanography in La Jolla, California. Argo data can also be displayed in Google Earth with a layer developed by the Argo Technical Coordinator.  Data results  The number of papers, by year, published in refereed journals and that are extensively or totally dependent on the availability of Argo data as of 26 March 2018. Argo is now the dominant source of information about the climatic state of the oceans and is being widely used in many publications as seen in the diagram opposite. Topics addressed include air-sea interaction, ocean currents, interannual variability, El Ni√±o, mesoscale eddies, water mass properties and transformation. Argo is also now permitting direct computations of the global ocean heat content. A notable recent paper was published by Durack and Wijffels that analyzed global changes in surface salinity patterns. They determine that areas of the world with high surface salinity are getting saltier and areas of the world with relatively low surface salinity are getting fresher. This has been described as 'the rich get richer and the poor get poorer'. Scientifically speaking, the distributions of salt are governed by the difference between precipitation and evaporation. Areas, such as the northern North Pacific Ocean, where precipitation dominates evaporation are fresher than average. The implication of their result is that the Earth is seeing an intensification of the global hydrological cycle. Argo data are also being used to drive computer models of the climate system leading to improvements in the ability of nations to forecast seasonal climate variations. Argo data were critical in the drafting of Chapter 3 (Working Group 1) of the IPCC Fifth Assessment Report (released September 2013) and an appendix was added to that chapter to emphasize the profound change that had taken place in the quality and volume of ocean data since the IPCC Fourth Assessment Report and the resulting improvement in confidence in the description of surface salinity changes and upper-ocean heat content. Argo data were used along with sea level change data from satellite altimetry in a new approach to analyzing global warming, reported in Eos in 2017. David Morrison reports that \\"[b]oth of these data sets show clear signatures of heat deposition in the ocean, from the temperature changes in the top 2 km of water and from the expansion of the ocean water due to heating. These two measures are less noisy than land and atmospheric temperatures.\\"  See also  * Ocean acoustic tomography * Underwater gliders * Integrated Ocean Observing System  References   External links  *The Argo Portal *International Argo Information Centre *Argo at the Scripps Institution of Oceanography, San Diego *Sea-Bird Scientific SBE 41CP Argo CTD *Realtime Interactive Map *Realtime Google Earth File *Coriolis Global Argo Data Server - EU Mirror *FNMOC Global Argo Data server - US Mirror *NOAA/Pacific Marine Environmental Laboratory profiling float project deploys floats as part of the Argo program, provides data on-line, and is active in delayed-mode salinity calibration and quality control for US Argo floats. *Sea-Bird Scientific Navis BGCi Float *Changing conditions in the Gulf of Alaska as seen by Argo *Government of Canada, Department of Fisheries and Oceans, Argo Project *A New World View Argo explorations article by Scripps Institution of Oceanography *JCOMMOPS *Argo on NOSA *\\"Argo Floats: How do we measure the ocean\\" (animation for children) Category:Fisheries science Category:Oceanography Category:Oceanographic instrumentation Category:Physical oceanography Category:Research projects ","title":"Argo (oceanography)"},{"id":"1245140","text":"threedegrees or 3¬∞ (frequently referred to as Three Degrees) was a communication and P2P application produced by Microsoft.

He grew up in Wai'anae and, after leaving school, debuted on the 1986 Gotcha Pro at Sandy Beach, Oahu, beating the 1984 champ Tom Carroll.Surfline His top surfing achievement was becoming the ASP WCT World Champion in 2000 but Garcia also holds the record for most WQS event wins, 22,ASP Stats Guide and holds six Triple Crown of Surfing titles. In addition, he was the second professional surfer to win over $1 million in prize money.Lat34.com He initially retired in 2005 but is now competing again, although in 2008, his hopes for ASP World Tour qualification were dashed with early elimination in the O'Neill World Cup of Surfing. Biography =Personal= Following his parents' divorce, Garcia lived with his mother near MƒÅ'ili point, close to the beach. He was a dominant force in the Hawaiian Surfing Association and soon made the grade, as a 17-year-old, on the 1986 WCT, beating former champion Tom Carroll and threatening to cause an upset to the top 16. Despite this early promise he just failed to break into this elite group on his debut season but the following year he finished in 16th position. Garcia showed great consistency throughout the 1990s, finishing in the top ten every year and coming third four times during that period. However, in 1995 it seemed that he might have reached the climax of his career. Failing to win the Pipeline Masters to claim the title Sunny ended up finishing third behind Kelly Slater and Rob Machado. With a host of talented young blood set to qualify for the 1996 Dream Tour and declining fitness levels, it seemed Garcia's era was over. Then, four years later, things changed. Inspired by veteran Mark Occhilupo's shock 1999 WCT title, Garcia shed weight and moved to Kauai. There he surfed with the progressive Irons brothers, Andy and Bruce, expanding his surfing repertoire. In 2000, 14 years after his debut, Garcia achieved the ultimate surfing accolade, emphatically dominating the ASP WCT from the start of the campaign, winning the first two events in Australia and clinching the title in Brazil, the penultimate event. On the way he also picked up a fifth Triple Crown in his native Hawaii. After initially retiring from the professional surfing circuit in 2005, Garcia is now competing on the WQS again. In 2008, he started slowly but moved into the top ten after a fifth-place finish in Scotland. Garcia was determined to win the series, and many people tipped him to do so but in the end early elimination in the O'Neill World Cup of Surfing, in his own back yard, meant he was denied a place on the 2009 Dream Tour. In 2009 he had surgery on his knee and finished the year strongly, following a quarter final berth in the Hawaiian pro with a runner-up spot to Triple Crown rival Joel Parkinson in the O'Neill World Cup. However his attempt to clinch a seventh Triple Crown was denied when he lost his Pipemasters place after arriving late for his heat. Some consolation would have come from his standout performance at the 'Quiksilver in memory of Eddie Aikau' big wave contest (\\"The Eddie\\"), in which he finished third. As of June 2010, he was placed 67th in the new ASP World Rankings, his best result being a quarter-final finish on the 'Sponsor me now Sunset Open' in January. Garcia has been a controversial figure, depicted as both volatile and easygoing by those who have met him. He has served prison time for tax evasion and been arrested for fighting. According to ESPN TV, his nickname Sunny was given to him by his mother, due to his cheerful disposition as an infant. He is known as a tough competitor but also someone who owes success to the anger he feels when surfing, which he often takes out physically on his competitors.EXPN TV He has been married three times, most recently to Colleen McCullough in 2008, and has three teenage children from his first marriage.LA Times Stab On April 30, 2019, the World Surf League announced that Garcia was in critical condition at a Portland hospital. Garcia had attempted suicide the previous day. On September 17, 2019, Garcia's daughter, Kaila, reported that Sunny had previously been in a coma, but he is speaking again and doing physical, speech and occupational therapy. Since December 2014, Garcia had been open about his struggles about depression and mental health, even encouraging those who deal with mental illness to talk about their feelings with others. =Statistics= Titles/records held * 2000 ASP WCT World Champion * 2004 Triple Crown of Surfing * 2000 Triple Crown of Surfing * 1999 Triple Crown of Surfing * 1994 Triple Crown of Surfing * 1993 Triple Crown of Surfing * 1992 Triple Crown of Surfing * 1987/1988 ASP's Men's Most Improved award * 1990 ASP's Men's Most Improved award * Most victories in WQS competition (22) * Most Triple Crown of Surfing titles (6) History of wins 2004 * Vans Hawaiian Pro (Alii Beach - Hale'iwa, Hawaii) 2002 * G-Shock Hawaiian Pro (Alii Beach - Haleiwa, Hawaii) 2000 * Billabong Pro (Kirra Point - Gold Coast, Australia) * Rip Curl Pro Bells Beach, (Australia) * Panasonic Shockwave US Open (Huntington Beach, California) * G-Shock Hawaiian Pro (Alii Beach - Haleiwa, Hawaii) * Rip Curl World Cup (Sunset Beach - Oahu, Hawaii) 1997 * Katin Team Challenge (Huntington Beach, California) 1996 * Rip Curl Pro (Bells Beach, Australia) * Town and Country (Ala Moana - Oahu, Hawaii) 1995 * Rip Curl Pro (Bells Beach, Australia) * Quiksilver Surfmasters (Grande Plage - Biarritz, France) * Rusty Pro (Honolua Bay - Maui, Hawaii) * Op Pro (Huntington Beach, California) * T&C;/Bud Surf Tour Championships (MƒÅkaha - Oahu, Hawaii) 1994 * Reunion Pro (Saint-Leu, R√©union) * Billabong Kirra Pro (Kirra Point - Gold Coast, Australia) * T&C;/Bud Surf Tour Championships (MƒÅkaha - Oahu, Hawaii) * Hapuna World Cup of Surfing (Sunset Beach - Oahu, Hawaii) 1993 * HIC Pro (Banzai Pipeline - Oahu, Hawaii) * Op Pro (Huntington Beach, California) * Wyland Galleries Hawaiian Pro (Alii Beach - Haleiwa, Hawaii) 1992 * Gunston 500 (Durban, Natal, South Africa) * T&C; O'Neill Pro (Kuhio Beach - Maui, Hawaii) * Pukas Pro (Zarauz, Basque Country, Spain) * Marui/Surfin' Life Qualifying (Hebara Beach - Chiba, Japan) * Miyazaki Qualifying (Miyazaki, Japan) * Xcel Pro (Sunset Beach - Oahu, Hawaii) * Wyland Galleries Hawaiian Pro (Alii Beach - Haleiwa, Hawaii) 1990 * Pukas Pro (Zarauz, Basque Country, Spain) * Seland Pro (Sopelana, Basque Country, Spain) =Awards= In 2010, Sunny was inducted into the Surfing Walk of Fame at Huntington Beach.Surfing Walk Of Fame Has New Member Sunny Garcia, Content Update Service News (accessed 27 February 2011)Surf Pioneer Sunney Garcia, Surfing Walk of Fame (accessed 27 February 2011) Sunny Garcia Inducted Into The Surfing Walk of Fame, Surf Devil (accessed 27 February 2011) =Volunteer Work= Garcia has often volunteered for the charity Surfers Healing, a foundation for autism, which has included beach clean-up days held in Hawaii and along California's coast.Sunny Garcia, The Surge (accessed 27 February 2011) In 2011, Garcia is the host of \\"Surfers for Cystic Fibrosis\\" golf tournament fundraiser that has been organized by the charitable organization The Mauli Ola Foundation.

It is almost always performed as part of the surgical management of cancer. In a regional lymph node dissection, some of the lymph nodes in the tumor area are removed; in a radical lymph node dissection, most or all of the lymph nodes in the tumor area are removed. Indications It is usually done because many types of cancer have a marked tendency to produce lymph node metastasis early in their natural history. This is particularly true of melanoma, head and neck cancer, differentiated thyroid cancer, breast cancer, lung cancer, gastric cancer and colorectal cancer. Famed British surgeon Berkeley Moynihan once remarked that \\"the surgery of cancer is not the surgery of organs; it is the surgery of the lymphatic system\\". The better-known examples of lymphadenectomy are axillary lymph node dissection for breast cancer; radical neck dissection for head and neck cancer and thyroid cancer; D2 lymphadenectomy for gastric cancer; and total mesorectal excision for rectal cancer. =With sentinel node biopsy= For clinical stages I and II breast cancer, axillary lymph node dissection should only be performed after first attempting sentinel node biopsy., which cites various primary research studies. Sentinel node biopsy can establish cancer staging of the axilla if there are positive lymph nodes present. It also is less risky than performing lymphadenectomy, having fewer side effects and a much lower chance of causing lymphedema. If cancer is not present in sentinel lymph nodes then the axillary lymph node dissection should not be performed. If one or two sentinel nodes have cancer which is not extensive, then no axillary dissection should be performed but the person with cancer should have breast-conserving surgery and chemotherapy appropriate for their stage of cancer. =With sentinel lymph node mapping= The concept of sentinel lymph node mapping was popularized by Donald Morton and others. Cancer with various primary sites (breast, melanoma, colorectal, etc.) often metastasize early to the first drainage lymphatic basin. This process is predictable anatomically according to the primary site in the organ and the lymphatic channels. The first nodes (sentinel nodes) can be identified by particulate markers such as lymphazurin, methylene blue, India ink and radio-labelled colloid protein particles injected near the tumor site. The draining sentinel node can then be found by the surgeon and excised for verification by the pathologist if tumor cells are present, and often these tumor cells are few and only easily recognized by careful examination or by using techniques such as special stains, i.e. immunohistochemical. When the sentinel node is free of tumor cells, this is highly predictive of freedom from metastasis in the entire lymphatic basin, thus allowing a full node dissection to be avoided. The practice of sentinel lymph node mapping has changed the surgical approach in many cancer systems, sparing a formal lymph node dissection for patients with sentinel lymph node negative for tumor and directing a full node dissection for patients with sentinel lymph node positive for tumor metastases. For example in stage II breast carcinoma, using the sentinel lymph node technique, 65% of patients could be spared from a formal node dissection. Complications Lymphedema may result from lymphadenectomy. Extensive resection of lymphatic tissue can lead to the formation of a lymphocele. It is uncertain whether inserting wound drainage after groin lymph nodes dissection can reduce complications such as seroma, haematoma, wound dehiscence, and wound infection.

Etymology and history of the term The word hoplology is derived from the Greek terms hoplos (a mythical plate-armored animal) and ·ΩÖœÄŒªŒøŒΩ h√≥plon, a wooden shield carried by some warriors in ancient Greece. The word hoplite, derived from hoplon, is the term for the classical Greek warrior who carried such a shield. The field originates in the 19th century with Sir Richard Burton; although the origin of the word is often attributed to Burton, there are earlier references to it. Despite the work of Burton and a few others, it was not until the 1960s that hoplology took shape as an academic field of study under the leadership of Donn F. Draeger. Hoplology was at some time defined as the science of \\"arms and weapons of offense and defence, human and bestial\\" (Burton, 1884),Richard Francis Burton - The Book of the Sword: A History of Daggers, Sabers, and Scimitars from Ancient Times to the Modern Day - 7th page of Chapter 1 - Preamble: on the Origin of Weapons published by Skyhorse Publishing, Inc. 20 November 2013, 336 pages, [Retrieved 2015-07-27] and subsequently as \\"the study of the basis, patterns, relationships, and significances of combative behavior at all levels of social complexity\\" (Draeger, 1982).International Hoplology Society - home-page published by the International Hoplology Society, Inc. 1998-2007 Sid Campbell, a black belt level, tenth dan-ranked in karate, defines hoplology as \\"the study of the evolution and development of human combative behaviour and performance ... the study of how people fight, why they fight, and how different cultures manifest those behaviours.\\"Sid Campbell - Warrior Arts and Weapons of Ancient Hawai'i Blue Snake Books 2006, 266 pages, [Retrieved 2015-07-30] More recently, hoplology is defined as the investigation and analysis of all forms of armed combat. It is most productively seen as an embodied event where the physiological and neurological structures of those individuals taking part in a combative encounter shape and, in turn, are shaped by cultural norms of what is right, effective, and efficient and so changes overtime and across space. As in all human encounters, every combat event is accompanied by a form of material technology and has been learned through a process of apprenticeship. Warriors, Scholars, Explorers and their Hoplologies  = 1800s - The accidental Hoplologists': Burton & Pitt-Rivers = Richard Francis Burton Several pioneering Anthropologists were also contributing to the field of Hoplology while Burton was active. A retired military officer who fought in the Crimean War, A.H.L. Pitt-Rivers developed a now outdated view of human evolution. Cultures, he concluded, evolved through time from technologically simpler societies to technologically complex societies. In other words, progress is an integral aspect of human history. Primitive Warfare 2. Oxford: The Journal of the Royal United Service Institution Vol. XII 1868 NO. LI. Working in the Trobriand Islands (just off Australia) around the time of WWI, the renowned Anthropologist Bronislaw Malinowski also delved into the field of Hoplology. \\"War and Weapons Among the Natives of the Trobriand Islands\\". Man. Vol. 20 pg.10-12 (1920). A H Pitt Rivers Hoplology has always had a theoretical and practical orientation.

Draeger's student and colleague, Hunter B. Armstrong, went on to carry on Draeger's project as director of IHS. He continues closely with military and law enforcement, and has been central to the most recent recreation of the Marine Corps Martial Arts Program (MCMAP). Also, during this time working with Basil Richardson of the Victoria and Albert Museum, Roald Knutsen's wrote \\"Japanese Spear: Polearms and Their Use in Old Japan\\" (1963).

Bronislaw MalinowskiDuring the 1970's, The Republic of China began a number of academically based (and often government funded) investigations into several folk combat traditions. One drawback to many of these works is that they have yet to be translated in English, limiting the exposure of their findings. In other cases, they were inspired by ethno-nationalist or ideological considerations and no real effort has been made to engage with the growing international literature on Martial Arts Studies.

Overview of Draeger-IHS approach to Hoplology Hoplology (as professed by Draeger-IHS) has three main research areas: technological, functional, and behavioral. * Technological hoplology studies the development of weapons, armor, and other combative tools in relation to the contexts in which they are created. *Functional hoplology delves into the structure, development, and organization of combative systems and their relationship to the application of fighting and weapons. * Behavioral hoplology encompasses the psychological and physiological factors that affect human‚Äôs combative behavior and development of combative capabilities such as weapons or fighting systems. The broad subject range of behavioral hoplology means it also includes the effects that culture has had on man‚Äôs evolution as a group-social animal. There are three IHS axioms in hoplological studies. * human combative behavior is rooted in man‚Äôs evolution. * humans exhibit two types of aggression: affective aggression and predatory aggression. Both forms evolved from different survival needs as both a group-social animal and as a hunting animal. * the evolution of human combative behavior is directly linked to the use of weapons. That is to say that the use of weapons is linked with and reflects combative performance and behavior. A variation on the pragmatics of hoplological understanding is found in theatrical representations of combat. The Draeger-IHS hoplological view on violence: The entrenched nature of violence in human behavior is generally well understood. The skill and potential of deadly aggression is something within human genetics which predisposes humans to violent behavior. However, the genetics that predispose humans to violence is highly influenced by environmental factors. Humans will only tap into their violent potential once the need has arisen. Human genetics have developed an on-off switch in the brain. On the on side \\"‚Ä¶the fighting activity itself is stimulated by individual and communal thrill, enjoyment in the competitive exercise of spiritual and physical faculties, and even cruelty, blood lust, and killing ecstasy.\\" (Gat 2006) On the off-side violence is deterred away by emotions through fear, revulsion at violence and bloodshed, physical fatigue, compassion, and spirituality. So if the environmental factors that cause a man to be violent are present, then he will be violent. If the environmental factors that cause a man to be violent are not present, he will abstain and deter violence.Gat, Azar. War in Human Civilization. New York: Oxford UP, USA, 2006. Print = 2000s - The Embodied Interdisciplinary Hoplologists: Lunia, Ryan, Obi, Tamer = More recently Anthropologists and other scholars have begun increasingly to examine how local people actually fight with weapons. Ethnographies such as Michael Ryan's Venezuelan Stick Fighting: The Civilizing Process in Martial Arts (2016). Philip Forde‚Äôs recently completed doctoral dissertation ‚ÄúBlocking both Hand and Foot: An Examination of Bajan Sticklicking‚Äù (2018) is another informative work. Avron Boretz‚Äôs Gods, Ghosts, and Gangsters: Ritual Violence, Martial Arts and Masculinity on the Margins of Chinese Society (2011) describes Kung Fu training with working-class men and petty criminals in rural Taiwan. Pentjak Silat on the island of Java was explored by Lee Wilson in Martial Arts and the Body Politic in Indonesia (2015). In 2017 we saw an emergence of a New Hoplology, pioneered by The Immersion Projects. Immersion Projects continue to lead multiple expeditions, sponsor symposiums and launched a new journalThe Immersion Review, www.TheImmersionMedia.com/review focused on the study of combat.

Vincent Tamer successfully published a field report on this expedition. Current Trends - The New Hoplology Mahipal Lunia, Michael J. Ryan & T.J. Obi: faces of the New Hoplology In 2018 a group of academics and veteran martial artists came together to explore the roots of bodily movements with weapons to uncover any underlying principles that shape all combat. Under the flag of a \\"New Hoplology\\" they conceptualized this study as an interdisciplinary project where in consideration of the diversity of its members, different research questions could be explored during the same project. One feeling shared among the group was to identify the most highly skilled exponents of combative systems. Those that were in the past and still today, first and foremost are seen and treated as combative arts that they have not evolved into modern recreations, sporting activities, folkloric representations of a past time. Next, they sought to conduct in-depth interviews and archive their system so s to provide a repository of data for future scholars and martial artists. Due to the nature of the project, these would be short term yet intensive research projects (typically ten 14-16 hour days of deep immersion in the cosmology, belief systems, history and combat methods).

The group formed as a trio in Charlottesville, Virginia in 1991, with Sokolowski, Ross, and drummer John Gilmore. The group performed live for several years, then released their first studio album, In November Sunlight, in 1996. The album received notably high record sales for an instrumental album, mainly due to its guest appearance by members of the Dave Matthews Band‚ÄîDave Matthews, LeRoi Moore, and Tim Reynolds. In 1997, Gilmore left the group, however Sokolowski and Ross remained close and continued performing together. The duo began working on their second album, Two, in 2000, which featured writing, arranging, and singing contributions by Ross, whereas the previous album primarily contributions strictly from Sokolowski. The album took almost five years to complete, and was not released until 2005, however the album featured many more guest performers than the previous album, including former band member John Gilmore. Due to confusion with other bands of the same name, Soko was renamed to \\"Sokoband\\" in 2010. On March 9, 2010, Sokoband released a self- titled album, Sokoband, which contains all eight tracks from In November Sunlight, as well as two additional tracks, entitled \\"And Yet Your Smile\\" and \\"Nightfall.\\" The band was not happy with the musical execution or production of the 1996 release, and wanted to present more definitive realizations of the compositions.

The feature that gives both the boot and shoe their name is the very sharp and long pointed toe, reminiscent of medieval footwear and approximately the same as the long pointed toes on some women's high-fashion shoes and boots in the 2000s. The extremely pointed toe was called the winkle picker because in England periwinkle snails, or winkles, are a popular seaside snack which is eaten using a pin or other pointed object to extract the soft parts out of the coiled shell carefully, hence the phrase: \\"to winkle something out\\", and based on that, winklepickers became a humorous name for shoes with a very pointed tip. Other countries had other humorous names, e.g. in Norway and Sweden they were called myggjagere/myggjagare, literally \\"Mosquito chasers\\". They are still popular in the raggare and rockabilly subcultures. In some parts of the U.S. they are called \\"roach stompers\\".  History  = Origins = Winklepickers, inspired by the crakowes worn by the medieval French nobility,Grew, F. and de Neergaard, M. 1988. Shoes and Pattens. Medieval Finds from Excavations in London: 2. London: HMSO, pp. 88‚Äì9. were a conspicuous contrast to the brothel creepers worn by Teddy Boys. The male shoes were lace- up Oxford style with a low heel and an exaggerated pointed toe. A Chelsea Boot style (elastic-sided with a two-inch, and later as much as two-and-one-half- inch, Cuban heel) was notably worn by the Beatles but although it had a pointed toe, was not considered to be a winklepicker. Winklepicker shoes from Stan's of Battersea were also worn by Teddy Girls as well as being a fleeting fashion for young women generally. = 1960s = In the early 1960s, the winklepicker toe was popular with modernists, the forerunners of the mods. In the early 1960s, the point was effectively chopped off (they hung on for longer than that in the UK) and gave rise to the \\"chisel toe\\" on the footwear of both genders. However, winklepickers with traditional sharp-point styles made a comeback of sorts in the late 1970s and early 1980s (either as previously unworn old-stock, second-hand originals, or contemporary-production attempted copies) and worn by several subculture groups including mods, rockabillies, punks, rock'n'roll revivalists, and in the goth scene, where they are known as \\"pikes\\".Lejtenyi, Patrick (2000‚Äì06). \\"Back from the Grave\\" Exclaim!. Retrieved 2007-12-29. \\"...and the Beatle boots...\\" Winklepickers with stiletto heels for women swept the UK in the late 1950s, and at one stage, the High Street versions were commonly worn by a large part of the adult female populace of the UK. They were often manufactured in Italy, but the handmade versions, notably those from Stan's Shoes of Battersea, were the most extreme, if somewhat bulky-looking at the toe compared with the Italian styles.Kippen, Cameron. \\"Beatle Boots\\" The History of Boots. Department of Podiatry. Retrieved 2007-10-11. \\"The Beatle Boot saw the reintroduction of heels for men.\\" The original 1960s winklepicker stilettos were similar to the long, pointed toe that has been fashionable on women's shoes and boots in Europe of late. The long, sharp toe was always teamed with a stiletto heel (or spike heel), which, as today, could be as low as one-and-a-half inches or as high as five inches, though most were in the three- to four-inch range. The stiletto heels on the original 1960s styles were, however, much more curved in at the rear (also sometimes sharply waisted and slightly flared out at the top piece) than most of the recent pointy-toed fashion shoes, which often have straighter, thicker, more set-back heels, rather at odds with the look of the pointed toe. In most cases, too, the modern shoe toes lack the length of the true 1960s winklepicker and bear more resemblance to the less pointed mass- produced versions of the era.Bassett McCleary, John (2004). Hippie Dictionary: A Cultural Encyclopedia of the 1960s and 1970s. Ten Speed Press. pp. 44. . They attained some notoriety, when they first appeared, as a result of being worn in gang fights (sometimes by both sexes), although there is some question as to the accuracy of contemporary newspaper accounts. In fact, although the winklepicker looks lethal, it would be far more likely for damage to be caused to the delicately pointed shoe than to the opponent in any serious kicking incident. =Modern day= By the middle of the first decade of the 21st century, winklepickers were worn with 1960s mod blazers, Western shirts, vintage T shirts, and skinny jeans by many indie pop bands and musicians, such as of Kings of Leon, Kaiser Chiefs, The Kills, The Horrors, Jack White, Mod Fun, Neils Children, Blanaid Montague, Klaxons, and Daniel Johns. The shoes are closely related to British Garage Rock band The Horrors, who even went as far as to have a winklepicker boot with three buckles on their official merchandise t-shirt along with the words \\"I am a horror.\\" Faris Badwan has personally endorsed Paolo Vandini Veers. They are also worn by English comedians Russell Brand and Noel Fielding and English DJ and TV presenter Alex Zane. Winklepicker boots are very popular in Germany among the modern Vogue Goth and Punk subcultures, who refer to the boots as \\"pikes\\". Although slightly pointed toes are often a feature of women's fashion shoes, they are usually nowadays \\"tamed down\\" or shortened (often sacrificing comfortable toe space) for mass market appeal.

She created the Poor Boy Sweater, which was featured on the cover of French Elle magazine. Her knitwear designs and new fashion techniques led her to be dubbed the \\"Queen of Knits\\". The Sonia Rykiel label was founded in 1968 upon the opening of her first store, making clothing, accessories and fragrances. Rykiel was also a writer and her first book was published in 1979. In 2012, Rykiel revealed that she was suffering from Parkinson's. She died from complications of the disease on 25 August 2016. Early and personal life Sonia Flis was born to Jewish parents in Neuilly-sur-Seine on 25 May 1930. Her mother was from Russia, and her father was a watchmaker from Romania. She was the eldest of five sisters. In 1948, at the age of 17, she was employed to dress the window displays in a Parisian textile store, the Grande Maison de Blanc. In 1953, Sonia married Sam Rykiel, owner of Laura, a boutique selling elegant clothing. The couple had two children, Nathalie and Jean-Philippe Rykiel. They divorced in 1968. Rykiel often wore her clothes from her own label and stuck to wearing dark green, brown, navy, and black garments. Of her style, Rykiel said, \\"I hate wasting time getting dressed. I like to put something on and just think: 'Yes. That's it.' When I'm tired I like to dress very simply ‚Äì perhaps a black cr√™pe jacket and black cr√™pe trousers.\\" Rykiel was also known for her distinctive hairstyle ‚Äì red hair cut into a bob with a heavy fringe. Career =Fashion= In 1962, unable to find something to wear during her pregnancy, Rykiel used an Italian clothing supplier to design and create a dress and a sweater, which incorporated high cut arm holes and a shrunken fit to cling to the body. The practical and modern style led to orders from her friends and became known as the Poor Boy Sweater. Rykiel started selling the sweaters from her husband's store and the Poor Boy Sweater made the cover of French Elle magazine, bringing Rykiel fame. Actress Audrey Hepburn bought 14 sweaters in every colour. Rykiel's husband helped her to create the Sonia Rykiel Company in 1965. In 1968, Rykiel opened her first boutique store on the Left Bank. Clothing by Sonia Rykiel in Paris. Rykiel invented various fashion techniques. She was the first designer to put seams on the outside of a garment, leave hems unfinished and use slogans on her sweaters. She has also been credited with popularisation of wearing black. In 1972, Rykiel was dubbed \\"Queen of Knits\\" by Women's Wear Daily. She was also known as \\"Coco Rykiel\\", a comparison to Coco Chanel. In 1977, she became the first designer to create a line of clothes for mail order firm 3 Suisses. The following year, she launched her first fragrance called Septi√®me sens (Seventh Sense). Rykiel contributed to the interior decoration for the H√¥tel de Crillon and the H√¥tel Lutetia. Rykiel designed and created the costumes for the French musical comedy Les Dix Commandements. Nathalie Rykiel was appointed president of Sonia Rykiel in 2007. In October 2008, at a fashion show celebrating the brand's 40th anniversary, tributes were paid to Rykiel. Thirty fashion designers, including Ralph Lauren, Jean-Paul Gaultier and Giorgio Armani, showcased their visions of the \\"Rykiel woman\\". The brand and its designs were also the subject of an exhibition at the Mus√©e des Arts D√©coratifs, Paris from 20 November 2008 to 20 April 2009. The Sonia Rykiel Exhibition was curated by Olivier Saillard. In December 2009, Rykiel and H&M; introduced \\"Sonia Rykiel pour H&M;\\", two masstige operations with the Swedish retailer. An event was held at the Grand Palais in Paris to celebrate the collection. From January 2012, Sonia Rykiel became majority-owned by the Hong Kong-based First Heritage Brands, part of the investment company Fung Brands. Fung Brands acquired 80 percent of Sonia Rykiel, with the Rykiel family retaining a 20 percent stake. That same year, Canadian designer Geraldo da Conceicao succeeded April Crichton as the artistic director of Rykiel. Julie de Libran took over the role during the following year. A street of Paris was named after Sonia Rykiel in October 2018. In 2019 after years of mismanagement by First Heritage Brands, the Sonia Rykiel brand liquidated its operations, after a Paris commercial court judge rejected L√©vy, the only remaining bidder for the company. =Writing= Rykiel was also a writer. She wrote several books about fashion, a collection of children's stories, magazine columns and an epistolary novel with R√©gine Deforges. Her first book Et Je La Voudrais Nue (I Would Like Her Naked) was published in 1979. In 2012, she co-authored N'oubliez pas que je joue (Don't forget it's a game) with journalist Judith Perrignon. =Music and film= Rykiel collaborated with impresario and performer Malcolm McLaren on the song \\"Who the Hell is Sonia Rykiel?\\" on McLaren's 1995 album Paris. Rykiel makes a cameo appearance in Robert Altman's 1994 film Pr√™t-√†-Porter. Altman was inspired to make the film after attending one of Rykiel's ready-to-wear fashion shows. The lead character, played by actress Anouk Aim√©e, was based on the designer. Rykiel appears as Hortense in the 1998 French comedy film Riches, belles, etc..

She was best known for co-writing (with Tony Hatch) the theme tunes to the game show Mr & Mrs for Border Television in 1975 and the Australian soap opera Neighbours in 1985. Career =Early years= Trent was born in Newcastle-under-Lyme, the daughter of coal-miner Les Burgess and his wife Lily. Her first stage appearance was as an eight-year-old ingenue in the pantomime Babes in the Wood and at the age of nine she won first prize in a national poetry competition. At the age of 11 she won the Carrol Levis and His Discoveries talent show and thereafter changed her stage name to \\"Jackie Trent\\", having lived in Stoke-on- Trent for the few years previous. She sang to packed audiences in local British Legion and working men's clubs and with local big bands, becoming known as \\"the Vera Lynn of the Potteries\\". Her first single, \\"Pick Up the Pieces\\", was released in 1962 on the Oriole label, but it was not until Pye Records and three years later that she scored her first hit with \\"Where Are You Now\\", written by Tony Hatch and Trent, who at that time were involved in a successful professional collaboration with Petula Clark. The song was featured in the popular TV series It's Dark Outside. \\"Where Are You Now\\" reached number one in the UK Singles Chart in May 1965, topping the chart for one week. The song was written and recorded in just four days after Hatch was asked by Granada TV to produce a song for the female lead in the programme to be seen on screen playing to herself. The lyrics were written by Trent on Christmas 1964, just before she embarked on a three-month tour of South Africa. When the song first hit the TV screen, people contacted TV Times to ask where they could buy the record with sales accelerating. The song went to number one in May 1965, replacing the Beatles' \\"Ticket to Ride\\". Petula Clark's 1966 hit, \\"I Couldn't Live Without Your Love\\" was inspired by the ongoing affair between Trent and Hatch, and they subsequently went public with their relationship. In August 1967 they were married in Kensington. Their duet \\"The Two Of Us\\" topped the Australian charts and created a demand for concert and cabaret performances earning the duo the nickname of \\"Mr & Mrs Music\\". Although she recorded several singles and albums, both as a solo artist and with her husband, Trent was more successful as a songwriter than a singer. In addition to their compositions for Clark, over the years she and Hatch wrote extensively for other artists, including Frank Sinatra, Dean Martin, Jack Jones, Nancy Wilson, Des O'Connor, Val Doonican, Shirley Bassey, and Vikki Carr. In 1968 the couple also wrote the song \\"Joanna\\", a hit for Scott Walker. In the late 1960s, Trent returned to the stage with a UK tour of the musical Nell, playing Gwynne opposite Hermione Baddeley as the title character. The show opened at the Richmond Theatre for a season in 1970. =1970s= In 1970, Trent recorded the Les Vandyke-composed \\"I'll Be Near You\\" and in March that year she appeared on the cover of the British music magazine NME. The 1970s saw Hatch and Trent diversify into the world of musical theatre. The first of their projects, The Card, based on Arnold Bennett's novel, with book by Keith Waterhouse and Willis Hall, ran in London's West End with Jim Dale and Millicent Martin in the starring roles. (Coincidentally, Clark had starred in the 1952 film version with Sir Alec Guinness). An original cast album was released in 1975. A rewritten version of the show, starring Peter Duncan and Hayley Mills, played the Regent's Park Open Air Theatre in the 1990s and spawned a new cast album. The second Hatch/Trent musical was Rock Nativity, with book and lyrics by David Wood. Initiated and produced by Cameron Mackintosh, it first played in Newcastle upon Tyne. An updated version of the show toured nationally in 1976, and was broadcast nationally by Scottish TV. A full-length concert version was also recorded at the Cork Opera House for transmission by RT√â. In 1972 the couple wrote the song \\"We'll Be With You\\", a celebration of Trent's home town football club Stoke City reaching the final of the Football League Cup. Released under the name 'The Potters' (the club's nickname), the song was recorded using Pye Records' outside broadcast unit and featured the team and supporters. Some 40 years on it is still played at all Stoke City home games and reached number 34 on the UK chart. Stoke beat Chelsea F.C. 2‚Äì1 in the final. =Theme to Neighbours= After Trent and Hatch relocated to Australia in the 1980s, they were asked to write the theme song for the television soap-opera Neighbours. The soap opera was going to be called Ramsay Street, before the couple penned the song. Trent told Jessie Stoelwinder from The West Australian, \\"We wrote the song as Neighbours because we said Ramsay Street was too close to Coronation Street, which was the major soap in Britain.\\". The theme was written and recorded in a day and Trent said \\"We called in Barry Crocker at about 10pm to put his voice on it and it was on the producer's desk by 10am the following morning. And they loved it, so the series was then called Neighbours.\\" =Recording career= In a recording career spanning 1962‚Äì1990, Trent issued a total of twelve albums, five compilations and 51 singles. =Later years= After returning to the UK, Trent toured with the musical High Society, in 1995. In 2015 Trent worked with two writers, Tim Wedgwood and Jonathan Fernyhough, on a stage show of her life. Prior to her death, she had been scheduled to appear in Jackie in May 2015.Profile , stoksentinel.co.uk; accessed 20 November 2015. Personal life When Trent and Hatch married in August 1967, Hatch already had two daughters from his first marriage. The couple went on to have a son and daughter together. They separated in 1995, before divorcing in 2002. Trent married Colin Gregory in November 2005, and the couple lived in Spain. Trent died in hospital on 21 March 2015, aged 74, in Menorca, Spain, after a long illness.

He is an emeritus professor in the History and Philosophy of Science department at the University of Pittsburgh. He has also taught at UCLA, the Rockefeller University, and the University of Minnesota, and was president of the Philosophy of Science Association. Biography John Earman was born in Washington, D.C. in 1942 and earned his Ph.D. at Princeton University in 1968 with a dissertation on temporal asymmetry (entitled Some Aspects of Temporal Asymmetry and directed by Carl Gustav Hempel and Paul Benacerraf). After holding professorships at UCLA, the Rockefeller University, and the University of Minnesota, he joined the faculty of the History and Philosophy of Science department of the University of Pittsburgh in 1985.http://www.pitt.edu/~pittcntr/About/The_Berlin_School.pdf He remained at Pittsburgh for the rest of his career, recently retiring to become Professor Emeritus. Earman is a former president of the Philosophy of Science Association and a fellow of the American Academy of Arts and Sciences, and of the American Association for the Advancement of Sciences.http://www.hps.pitt.edu/profile/earman.php He is a member of the Archive Board of the Phil-Sci Archive.http://philsci- archive.pitt.edu/information.html The hole argument Earman has notably contributed to debate about the \\"hole argument\\". The hole argument was invented for slightly different purposes by Albert Einstein late in 1913 as part of his quest for the general theory of relativity (GTR). It was revived and reformulated in the modern context by John3 (a short form for the \\"three Johns\\": John Earman, John Stachel, and John Norton). With the GTR, the traditional debate between absolutism and relationalism has been shifted to whether or not spacetime is a substance, since the GTR largely rules out the existence of, e.g., absolute positions. The \\"hole argument\\" offered by John Earman is a powerful argument against manifold substantialism. This is a technical mathematical argument but can be paraphrased as follows: Define a function d as the identity function over all elements over the manifold M, excepting a small neighbourhood (topology) H belonging to M. Over H, d comes to differ from identity by a smooth function. With use of this function d we can construct two mathematical models, where the second is generated by applying d to proper elements of the first, such that the two models are identical prior to the time t=0, where t is a time function created by a foliation of spacetime, but differ after t=0. These considerations show that, since substantialism allows the construction of holes, that the universe must, on that view, be indeterministic. Which, Earman argues, is a case against substantialism, as the case between determinism or indeterminism should be a question of physics, not of our commitment to substantialism.

History The village has Anglo-Saxon origins and is recorded in the Domesday Book of 1086. The toponym comes from the Old English words cropp (a hill) and ridig (a stream). From 1519 onwards Brasenose College, Oxford owned extensive land in Cropredy. Manor Farm was built in 1693 and Prescote Manor was built in 1721. Cropredy Bridge on the River Cherwell was the site of a major battle in 1644 during the English civil war. King Charles engaged the Parliamentarian army led by Sir William Waller. The battle was a stalemate; the Parliamentarian side suffered heavy casualties but ultimately prevented the King's forces from crossing the bridge. A plaque on the bridge bears the inscription: \\"Site of the Battle of Cropredy Bridge 1644. From Civil War deliver us.\\" Before the battle, some of the church valuables were hidden in the River Cherwell; these included the brass eagle lectern, which was not recovered for 50 years, during which time it was damaged. Church and chapels The Church of England parish church of Saint Mary the Virgin is built of the local ironstone, which is a ferrous Jurassic limestone. Parts of the south aisle date from the 13th century. However, most of the present building is Decorated Gothic and was built in the 14th century, including the chancel arch, nave arcades, east window and most of the windows in the south aisle. In the 15th century Perpendicular Gothic alterations were made including a clerestory added above the nave, the north aisle rebuilt with new windows, and both aisles extended eastwards to form side chapels. The church had a clock by 1512, when the vicar, Roger Lupton, left ¬£6 13s 4d in his will in trust for the churchwardens to pay someone to keep the clock running and chiming every quarter-hour and the village curfew. Lupton's will prescribed that the wardens be fined 6s 8d per month of ¬£10 per year if they were to fail. A new clock may have been installed around 1700, and Lupton's clock may then have been transferred to Claydon. The later clock was itself replaced in 1831 with a new one made by John Moore and Sons of Clerkenwell, London. The bell tower has a ring of bells. There were six, but in 2007 two new treble bells increased this to eight.Oxford Diocesan Guild of Church Bell ringers, Banbury Branch One of the new bells is named St Mary; the other Fairport Convention Festival Bell. St Mary's parish is now part of the Benefice of Shires' Edge along with those of Claydon, Great Bourton, Mollington and Wardington. By the 13th century Cropredy was associated with the legend of Saint Fremund, a Mercian who was said to have been martyred in the 9th century. Fremund's relics are supposed to have been moved from Offchurch in Warwickshire to Prescote, where they were lost for a time and then rediscovered and moved to Cropredy. They were then moved to the Augustinian Priory at Dunstable, probably in 1207, but an association with Fremund remained at Cropredy. There are records of gifts to a chapel and shrine to the saint here in 1488 and 1539, and a chantry priest serving in St. Fremund's chapel in 1489. During the English Reformation under Edward VI the Crown sold the chapel and its contents in 1549 and it was probably demolished. No trace remains, its site is unknown and it is not clear whether the shrine chapel was at St. Mary's church or elsewhere in the parish. A Methodist chapel had been built by 1822. The congregation outgrew it so a larger chapel was built on a new site in 1881. Transport The Oxford Canal at Cropredy Building of the Oxford Canal began at Hawkesbury Junction on the Coventry Canal in 1769 and reached Cropredy in October 1777. The canal passes between the River Cherwell and the village. There is a canal lock here, and at the south end of the village a wharf was built. This originally handled coal from the Coventry coalfield, and now serves the canal's popular leisure traffic. The wharf was briefly the canal's terminus, until the section from Cropredy to Banbury opened in March 1778. The canal finally reached Oxford and the River Thames at the end of 1789. The Oxford and Rugby Railway had been built from northwards past Cropredy by 1852. It never reached , but at it met the Birmingham and Oxford Junction Railway and thus became part of an important north-south main line. The Great Western Railway took over the O&RR; before it was completed, and opened Cropredy railway station to serve the village. The British Railways closed the station in 1956, but the railway remains open as part of the Chiltern Main Line. Cropredy's public transport is bus route 503 between Banbury and Long Itchington in Warwickshire, operated by Catteralls Coaches with one bus each way a week on Thursdays only and route 502, operated by Stagecoach, between Temple Herdewyke and Banbury with one bus each way a week on Saturdays and Good Friday. Education A National School, Cropredy and Bourton School, was opened in Cropredy in 1855. In 1867 it was renamed simply Cropredy School and a second classroom was added. In 1947 it was reorganised as a junior and infant school. Today it is a Church of England primary school. Amenities Cropredy has two public houses: the 17th century Brasenose ArmsThe Brasenose Arms and the Red Lion.The Red Lion The village has a G.P.'s practice and several shops. Annual music festival The stage at Fairport's Cropredy Convention annual festival, August 2009 On farmland east of the village British folk rock band Fairport Convention stages an annual three-day music festival titled Fairport's Cropredy Convention.

Owned and operated as part of the Super Radio Network of stations, it currently broadcasts a news talk and classic hits format to Newcastle, New South Wales and the surrounding Hunter region. First broadcast on 27 January 1925, it was established by founder Harry Douglas - from which the station derives its name - and is based in studios in Sandgate alongside sister station New FM. 2HD is Australia's second oldest existing radio station, first going to air just hours after Sydney's 2UE. History =1925-1945= 2HD began broadcasting on 27 January 1925, a day after Sydney's 2UE began operations. The station's call sign are the initials of the founder, Hugh (known as Harry) Douglas, not \\"Hunter District\\" as commonly believed. Douglas was a keen amateur radio enthusiast for some years prior to 1925, and an Alderman on the Newcastle City Council from 1919 to 1922. Harry's full name was Hugh Alexander McKay Douglas. He was also the first person to own a sulky and car tyre (retreading) business in Newcastle as well as having the first bowser petrol station in Newcastle. He was a man ahead of his time. The station was originally in the suburb of Hamilton, New South Wales, but moved to the corner of Darby and King Streets (to his tyre business address) soon after. Douglas sold the station to William Johnston in 1928, who sold the station to the 'Airsales Broadcasting Company' two years later in 1930. Airsales owned the company for 10 years, and was responsible for the move to its landmark studio building in Sandgate, which was 2HD's home for nearly 50 years. Although the building itself is very different, the middle section of the building is still the 1931 building. Under controversial circumstances during World War II, 2HD was closed in 1941, under the National Security Regulations. At the time, around 25 staff were employed by the station, and stories claimed that the station's owners were sending covert messages, based on the timing of the music being played etc. 2HD remained silent until near the end of the war when the Australian Labor Party and the Labor Council of New South Wales bought the station, and resumed transmissions on 15 January 1945. One of 2HD's notable personalities of the 1930s was Uncle Rex Sinclair, who continued to perform on local radio and stage until shortly before his death in 2001. =1945-1977= The Labor Party and the NSW Labour Council owned 2HD from 1945 until 1999. For the first 29 years of its ownership, the station was under the management of Jim Storey, with his wife Twink acting as program director and on-air personality. Other announcers during this time included Harry Randall, Stuart Dibbley and Tom Delaney. In the late 1950s and early 1960s, 2HD was one of the founding shareholders of local television station NBN Television. 2HD broadcast in the popular The Good Guys of Life format, also used by other stations, including 2SM Sydney. Presenters during this time included Harry Randall, Tom Delaney, Art Ryan, Haff Enegg, Mal Lamonte, John Hill, Allan McGirvan, Mike Jeffries, Malcolm Elliott, Keith Haerris, Graeme Gilbert, Don Mayo, Rob Maynard and Cliff Musgrave. Towards the end of this period, announcer Geoff Gregory joined the station, but was better known as a program director, and host of the Sunday night program Country Sounds. After the Good Guys era ended, 2HD transmitted other formats including Easy Alternative and country. In 1977, the original office building on Maitland Road Sandgate was closed. Several years prior to that, the building was gradually being demolished, starting with the destruction of the original transmitter building to make way for a dual carriageway along Maitland Road in 1964. The increased traffic and the location of the road near the old building was taking its toll. A new administration building, nicknamed \\"the submarine\\" was built, and NSW Premier Neville Wran opened the building in 1977. =1977-today= In the late 1970s-early 1980s, the station was the subject of a takeover bid from NBN, which resulted in a shake-up in ownership at the television station, and the bid was eventually rejected. For decades after the end of the \\"Good Guys\\" era, the station's ratings were in the doldrums, however, the station accomplished its first number one ratings success in 1987, after adopting a strong news and talk format. Factors in this success were the recruitment of 2KO's Pat Barton to present their breakfast program, and Warwick Teece, whose Openline program was a huge success. Program Director Peter Butler was a key part of the station's success, guiding the team to the top of the ratings. The coverage of the Newcastle earthquake in 1989 by the news team, led by Tony Briscoe, won the station a National Radio Award. The 90s saw 2HD confirm its place as the top rating station in Newcastle, led by the breakfast team of David Collins and Tanya Wilks who notched up over 8 years of consecutive survey wins, and supported by Geoff Jay and Richard King. The station expanded, following the purchase of local FM station New FM in 1995, which resulted in internal remodelling of the building. In 1999, the NSW Labor Party and NSW Labour Council sold the station to Bill Caralis. In 1997, the station added the John Laws Morning Show to its lineup, which it remained until his departure of 2UE in 2007. He was replaced by Steve Price (broadcaster), and later Steve Liebman, until Laws moved to network station 2SM in 2011 and was syndicated to rest of the Super Radio Network. Until 2006, the station also broadcast coverage of Newcastle Knights games, then syndicated from Macquarie Radio Network. However, following a dispute between BOG, Macquarie Radio Network and the National Rugby League (NRL) saw both the Continuous Call Team and Knights games go to rival 102.9 KOFM. In 2018, NRL, A League and AFL returns to 2HD with various games called live through the Networks partnership with Crocmedia.

Founded in 1891, it is one of the original 19 land-grant colleges and universities established by the second Morrill Act of 1890, which evolved as a diverse and inclusive campus. Following desegregation, WVSU's student population slowly became more white than black. As of 2017, WVSU is 75% white and only 8% African-American. The university's Gus R. Douglass Land-Grant Institute is divided into three programmatic divisions: WVSU Extension Service, WVSU Agricultural and Environmental Research Station, and The Center for the Advancement of Science, Technology, Engineering and Mathematics (CASTEM). The WVSU Extension Service (1890 Extension) provides community and agricultural outreach throughout West Virginia via 4-H Youth Development, Agriculture and Natural Resources, Community and Economic Development, and Family and Consumer Sciences programs. The WVSU Agricultural and Environmental Research Station (1890 Research) focuses on Aquaculture, Environmental Microbiology & Biotechnology, Horticultural Crops & Production Systems, Urban Forestry & Natural Resource Management, and Vegetable Genomics & Plant Breeding research programs. CASTEM programs encourage the state's youth to pursue careers in Science, Technology, Engineering and Mathematics Network (STEM) fields to become engineers, scientists, researchers, teachers, and leaders. History WVSU is located on land once occupied by Mound Builder Native Americans. The British government granted the site to George Washington for his service in the British military during the French and Indian War. It was subsequently sold and operated as plantation using enslaved labor. During the early 19th century, the son of Virginia Governor William H. Cabell, Samuel I. Cabell, moved to the Kanawha River valley and married, Mary Barnes, (a former slave), who bore thirteen children. He bought the property in 1853 and much to the displeasure of white neighbors, took elaborate precautions to ensure that Mary, his wife, and his descendants would inherit his wealth and not be sold into slavery, including officially emancipating Mary and their then-alive children in 1858. Sam Cabell was murdered shortly after the American Civil War and the creation of the state of West Virginia. Two decades later, his daughter Maria Cabell-Hurt sold some land to the new state to permit creation of the West Virginia Colored Institute, since Sam's descendants and neighbors had to send their children across the Ohio River to Ohio for higher education. Sam and Mary Cabell and their children are buried on the campus; some descendants continue to live nearby. =Early history= The school was established as the West Virginia Colored Institute in 1891 under the second Morrill Act, which provided for land-grant institutions for black students in the 17 states that had segregated schools. The school opened its doors in May 1892 and had an enrollment of over 40 students. The faculty consisted of President James Edwin Campbell, Byrd Prillerman, and T.C. Friend. The curriculum consisted of courses in agriculture, horticulture, mechanical arts, and domestic science. Teacher education (\\"normal\\") courses were added in 1893. Military education became an integral part of the school, and in 1899 West Virginia's legislature passed a bill to admit up to 60 cadets. In 1909, African-American educator and statesman, Booker T. Washington recommended his friend, Byrd Prillerman, become the institution's president. Washington had been instrumental in locating the institution located in the Kanawha Valley, visited the campus often and spoke at its first commencement exercise. During Prillerman's 10-year administration, the school established itself as the center of black intellectual life in the state. John Warren Davis, 5th President From 1891 through 1915, the school provided the equivalent of a high school education, with vocational training and teacher preparation for segregated public schools. In 1915, it became the West Virginia Collegiate Institute and began to offer college degrees. In 1919, John Warren Davis became president of the institute. A Morehouse graduate, Davis recruited highly qualified faculty and focused on curriculum development. He persuaded noted historian Carter G. Woodson to assist him as academic dean. In 1927, the school was accredited by the North Central Association of Colleges and Schools, making it the first of 17 original black land-grant schools to be certified by a regional association and one of only four black colleges to gain such status. It also became the first public college in West Virginia to be accredited by North Central. In 1929, the name was changed to West Virginia State College. With an enrollment of 1,000 students, the college contained divisions of Applied Arts and Sciences; Languages, Literature and Fine Arts; Natural Sciences and Mathematics; and Social Sciences and Philosophy. In 1939, West Virginia State College became the first of six historically black colleges to be authorized by the Civil Aeronautics Authority to establish an aviation program. Benefiting from the presence of the Wertz Field airport adjacent to campus, the program prepared many African American pilots to the U.S. Army Air Corps in World War II. Several college aviators joined the famed 99th Fighter Squadron and 332nd Fighter Group (the Tuskegee Airmen) that served with distinction in the European Theater. One of the original graduates of the aviation program, Rose Agnes Rolls Cousins, was the first African American woman to become a solo pilot in the Civilian Pilot Training Program. During World War II, West Virginia State College was one of 131 colleges and universities nationally that took part in the V-12 Navy College Training Program which offered students a path to a Navy commission. In 1942, a college ROTC program was established as an artillery unit. The ROTC tradition continues today, and the school has claimed 15 general officers who have graduated from West Virginia State, including Major General Charles C. Rogers and Major General Harvey D. Williams. =Desegregation= West Virginia State College underwent a significant transformation under the guidance of president William J.L. Wallace. In 1954, following the Brown v. Board of Education to desegregate public education, and the initiation of the G.I. Bill, the college transformed from diversifying its college with an influx of predominantly Caucasian commuter students because of the excellent educational reputation and affordability. This unique case of diversity garnered national attention. President Wallace hailed it as \\"a tribute to the character and courage of the people of Kanawha Valley.\\" As a result, West Virginia State adopted the motto \\"A Living Laboratory of Human Relations.\\" Enrollment substantially increased after the removal of racial barriers and veterans seeking educational advancement. In 1957, the school forfeited its land grant status. The West Virginia Board of Education voted to end state funding needed to match federal land-grant aid to West Virginia State. Although land-grant university funding is governed by federal laws, the federal aid is conditioned upon matching state funds. Under the leadership of President Hazo W. Carter, Jr., a 12-year quest was begun to restore the land-grant designation. The first step toward regaining the status came when Gov. Gaston Caperton signed a bill on Feb. 12, 1991, that had been passed by the Legislature to recognize the land-grant status on the state level. With the advocacy of Alumni, university leadership and assistance from West Virginia's U.S. Senator Robert C. Byrd, the U.S. Congress fully restored land-grant status in 2001. West Virginia State's birthright was restored and is recognized as an 1890 land-grant institution with recognition at the Federal level along with funding to carry out the mission of teaching, research, and public service. The land-grant institution of WVSU is named the Gus R. Douglass Land-Grant Institution. =University status= In 2003, the school's community college, established in 1953, was separately accredited as the West Virginia State Community and Technical College but remained administratively linked to West Virginia State College. In 2008, the legislature fully separated the community and technical college. However, both schools continued to share the same campus. In 2009, the Community and Technical College went through a name change and it was announced on April 20, 2009, as Kanawha Valley Community and Technical College. In the fall of 2012, KVCTC moved its campus to South Charleston, West Virginia. In 2004, under President Carter's leadership, West Virginia State College gained University status, becoming West Virginia State University and began to offer graduate degrees in Biotechnology and Media Studies. In the fall of 2011, WVSU began to offer a graduate degree in Law Enforcement. In the spring of 2014, WVSU began offering a graduate degree in education. Under President Brian O. Hemphill, the university set a goal to become the most student-centered research and teaching, land-grant university in West Virginia. Under President Anthony L. Jenkins, PhD, the university celebrated a historic achievement, receiving its full land-grant state match. =Leadership= Anthony L. Jenkins, the eleventh president of West Virginia State University; assumed presidency on July 1, 2016. Under the leadership of President Jenkins, WVSU has expanded its outreach and public service to all 55 counties throughout WV, increased academic program offerings to include Engineering and Nursing, increased retention and dual enrollment course offerings. Past presidents of the university include: James Edwin Campbell (1892‚Äì94), John H. Hill (1894‚Äì98), James McHenry Jones (1898‚Äì1909), Byrd Prillerman (1909‚Äì19), John Warren Davis (1919‚Äì53), William J.L. Wallace (1953‚Äì73), Harold M. McNeill (1973‚Äì81), Thomas W. Cole, Jr. (1982‚Äì86), Hazo W. Carter, Jr. (1986‚Äì2012), and Brian O'Harold Hemphill (2012‚Äì16). Several buildings on campus are named after them: Campbell Conference Center, Hill Hall, Jones Hall, Prillerman Hall, Davis Fine Arts Building, Wallace Hall, McNeill Facilities Building, and Cole Complex. James Edwin Campbell was a poet, free-lance writer, and mathematician from Pomeroy, Ohio. Following Campbell was John H. Hill, who was a lawyer, teacher, administrator, and soldier, who oversaw the university's first commencement. He resigned to fight in the Spanish‚ÄìAmerican War and later returned as an instructor. James McHenry Jones was responsible for adding teacher education (a \\"normal\\" department), and is buried on campus. Before becoming the fourth president, Byrd Prillerman was a faculty member and one of those responsible for locating the school in the Kanawha Valley. During his tenure, academic programs were expanded and the institution was renamed the \\"West Virginia Collegiate Institute\\". John Warren Davis focused on recruiting the best black faculty members he could find and developing the curriculum. He persuaded noted historian Carter G. Woodson to assist him as Academic Dean. During his tenure, the school was first accredited by the North Central Association of Colleges and Schools in 1927, and became West Virginia State College in 1929. Davis is the longest-serving president, having served for thirty-four years. William James Lord Wallace's greatest challenge of his presidency came following the U.S. Supreme Court's 1954 ruling, Brown v. Board of Education, which declared segregated schools to be unconstitutional. Following that, the historically black West Virginia State College opened its doors to all students. Dr. Wallace not only met the challenge but set an example for the world to follow. During Harold M. McNeill's tenure, the community college component was established; a building was erected for community college programs, and Ferrell Hall and the Drain- Jordan Library were renovated. During Thomas Winston Cole, Jr.'s administration, he made several organizational changes in the institution, creating new academic divisions and establishing a planning and advancement unit. Cole left West Virginia State in 1986 to become Chancellor of the West Virginia Board of Regents. Shortly after he became the ninth president in September 1987, Dr. Hazo W. Carter, Jr. began a 12-year quest to regain the college's land-grant status that had been transferred in the 1950s. Since \\"State\\" was the only institution to have the status removed, there was no precedent for recovering it. After this status was restored, a quest then began for West Virginia State to be designated a university, which became a reality in 2004; he became the first president to serve under the \\"university\\" status. These achievements, accompanied by two highly successful accreditation's by the North Central Association of Colleges and Schools and the addition of graduate programs, highlight his administration. In August 2011, the faculty voted no confidence in Carter's leadership, and Carter retired on June 30, 2012. He then became president emeritus until his death in February 2014. =Other= East Hall and the Canty House, home of \\"Colonel\\" James M. Canty, were listed on the National Register of Historic Places in 1988. WVSU's Fall and Spring Commencement Ceremonies were held in December and May, respectively, at the Charleston Civic Center in Charleston. Until 2009, WVSU and WVSCTC had joint commencement ceremonies. To cut back on spending, WVSU now holds its commencement ceremonies on campus. Until the completion of the new convocation center, the December commencement was held in the P.A. Williams Auditorium of Ferrell Hall, while the May commencement was either on the large lawn in the center of campus (also called the quad), or in the P.A. Williams Auditorium, pending weather. Commencements are now held in the D. Stephen and Diane H. Walker Convocation Center (Walker Convocation Center for short), a new addition/renovation to Fleming Hall. The Spring 2014 commencement was the first commencement held in the Walker Convocation Center. Student activities =Athletics= The athletic teams are known as the Yellow Jackets. WVSU athletic teams include men's football, baseball, basketball, golf, and tennis, and women's basketball, golf, softball, tennis, volleyball and soccer. During the segregation era, the school competed in athletics as \\"West Virginia\\" and played other segregated schools as a member of the Colored Intercollegiate Athletic Association. After desegregation, the school withdrew from the CIAA (today's Central Intercollegiate Athletic Association) and competed as \\"West Virginia State\\" to avoid confusion with West Virginia University. The school then moved to the formerly all-white West Virginia Intercollegiate Athletic Conference (WVIAC), which competed in the NCAA's Division II. After the dissolution of the WVIAC, WVSU joined the new Mountain East Conference in 2013, which is also part of NCAA Division II. During the segregation era, black high schools were barred from competition in the West Virginia Secondary School Activities Commission, and State therefore sponsored an unofficial \\"state colored championship\\" from 1932 to 1959. =Music= Instrumental ensembles In the mid-late 1990s, the band saw a period of resurgence under the direction of Chris Card. From 1995 until 2000, the band had an enrollment of between 35 and 50 members. Many of the members during this time period were scholarship recipients, and the band often contained 5-10 veterans or active members of Drum Corps International. The band was known for its small size and huge sound. The band marches in a \\"corps-style\\" fashion, the only band of its type at an HBCU, as most have a \\"show-style\\" band. The band tries to do a different marching show at every home football game, with the exception of homecoming. The Yellow Jacket Marching Band, also known as the \\"Marching Swarm\\", performs in one parade unless invited to others: the WVSU Homecoming Parade. In 2018, the band performed in Welch, WV's 100th Veteran's Day Parade, the longest ongoing Veteran's Day parade in the nation. The band has also played for the president's \\"State of the University Address\\", the Founder's Day ceremony, and annually for WVSU's ROTC Hall of Fame Ceremony. They have served as the exhibition band at high school marching band festivals, including Nicholas County's Mountain Band Spectacular (2008‚Äì2010), Poca High School's Heritage Day Festival in Poca (2009‚Äì2016, 2018‚Äìpresent), the 2013 WV Marching Band Invitational in Charleston, the 2015 Sissonville High School Cavalcade of Bands Band Festival in Sissonville, and the Boone County Coal Classic, hosted by Scott High School in Madison (2018‚Äìpresent). On October 12, 2013, WVSU, in co-sponsorship with the St. Albans High School Music Department, hosted the Cavalcade of Bands Southwest Regional Band Festival, and hosted it again in 2014. In 2008, the band was invited to go to Chicago with the football team for the Chicago Football Classic to participate in the Battle of the Bands competition; the only competition the band has competed in. The Wind Ensemble has performed at WVSU's commencement ceremonies. Students of the Advanced Conducting studio may also conduct on a concert. The Advanced Conducting studio is a unique feature of WVSU as not many colleges offer it at the undergraduate level. In the spring of 2015, the Symphonic Wind Ensemble performed at The Hamilton in Washington, D.C. as part of D.C.'s 153rd Emancipation Day Celebrations, and for the 150th Anniversary of Abraham Lincoln's Assassination. Beginning with the fall of 2015, WVSU offers a chamber orchestra, named the Charleston Chamber Orchestra, under the baton of Dr. Scott Woodard. On their debut concert, the ensemble performed a world premiere of a piece by local composer Matthew Jackfert. In June 2018, the orchestra performed in Carnegie Hall in New York City as part of the Viennese Masters Orchestra Invitational, hosted by Music Celebrations International (MCI), followed by a performance at the Kennedy Center in D.C. in February 2019 for MCI. They will tour in Vienna for Ludwig van Beethoven's 250th birthday in the summer of 2020 as part of MCI. The Jazz Ensemble performs for various events on and off campus. In November 2007, the Jazz Ensemble traveled to Austria to perform in Vienna, Graz, and Salzburg. On April 12 and 13, 2012, the Jazz Ensemble played two concerts for Washington, D.C.'s 150th Emancipation Day celebrations at the Lincoln Theatre. The April 12 concert featured the WVSU Jazz Ensemble and saxophonist Brian Lenair while the April 13th concert additionally featured a comedy show by famed comedian, Dick Gregory. The Jazz Ensemble returned the following year to perform for the 151st Anniversary on April 16 at Freedom Plaza. The Jazz Ensemble, along with the Concert Choir, performed at The Greenbrier on November 22, 2013, as part of the West Virginia Reading Association (WVRA) conference. In March 2016, the ensemble performed for the West Virginia Music Educators Association (WVMEA) conference. Other instrumental groups at WVSU include a Brass Ensemble, Guitar Ensemble, Percussion Ensemble, and Woodwind Ensemble. In addition, WVSU is home to the Montclaire String Quartet, the Quartet in Residence at WVSU, composed of the principle string players of the West Virginia Symphony Orchestra. Vocal ensembles In addition to the instrumental ensembles, WVSU also features the WVSU Concert Choir, the \\"State\\" Singers, a female vocal ensemble, and a male vocal ensemble. The State Singers consists of eight to ten vocalists with a required audition. The State Singers also perform as the WVSU Vocal Jazz Choir. The State Singers act as ambassadors for the University and frequently perform off campus for important community and cultural events. Every spring, the State Singers go on tour. Recent tours have taken the group to Cleveland, Ohio, Virginia Beach, St. Louis, Missouri, and New York City. On April 13 and 14, 2012, the Concert Choir had the unique opportunity of singing the music of \\"Queen\\" with the West Virginia Symphony Orchestra. The Concert Choir again sang with the WVSO for the symphony's 2012 holiday concerts, and have continued since. In March 2016, the Concert Choir again joined the symphony, along with three other West Virginia collegiate choirs, to perform the Brahms Requiem. Dr. Dirk Johnson is the Director of Choral Activities for WVSU and has been at that position since the fall of 2009. =Student life= Many of the students who live in dorms on campus are from large urban areas outside of West Virginia or from the rural counties in the state.

YamƒÅntaka () or Vajrabhairava (; ; Daewideok- myeongwang; Daiitoku-my≈ç≈ç; ) is the \\"destroyer of death\\" deity of Vajrayana Buddhism. Sometimes he is conceptualized as \\"conqueror of the lord of death\\". Of the several deities in the Buddhist pantheon named 'YamƒÅntaka', the most well known, also called as 'Vajrabhairava' belongs to the Anuttarayoga Tantra class of deities popular within the Gelug school of Tibetan Buddhism. Etymology YamƒÅntaka is a Sanskrit name that can be broken down into two primary elements: Yama (‡§Ø‡§Æ‡§æ), ‚Äìthe god of death; and antaka (‡§Ö‡§®‡•ç‡§§‡§ï) ‚Äìdestroyer. Thus, YamƒÅntaka means ‚ÄúDestroyer of Death‚Äù or \\"Conqueror of Death\\". One historic source of name follows Kalantaka, an aspect of the Hindu god Shiva who saves his follower from the clutches of death Yama and is seen as the deity of adherence and origin of the Mahamrityunjaya Mantra of Buddhism and Hinduism. While YamƒÅntaka is therefore Yama's nemesis, his representation mirrors Yama in many ways: He too often rides a buffalo and often depicted with a buffalo's head. Because of this mirroring of appearance and similarity in name, it is not hard to find texts and books (which would appear to be reliable sources of much material) conflate both YamƒÅntaka and Yama as being the same deity when they are not. Within Buddhism, \\"terminating death\\" is a quality of all buddhas as they have stopped the cycle of rebirth, samsara. So YamƒÅntaka represents the goal of the Mahayana practitioner's journey to enlightenment, or the journey itself: On final awakening, one manifests YamƒÅntaka ‚Äì the ending of death.  Outline  statue of YamƒÅntaka Vajrabhairava YamƒÅntaka is a wrathful expression of Ma√±ju≈õrƒ´, the Samyaksambuddha of wisdom who, in other contexts, also functions as a dharmapala or a Heruka. YamƒÅntaka manifests in several different forms, one of which has six legs, six faces and six arms holding various weapons while sitting or standing on a water buffalo. The topmost face is the wrathful aspect of Ma√±ju≈õrƒ´, with a red face below it. The other faces are yellow, dark blue, red, black, white, grey, and brown. Each face has three eyes. Common representations also depict thirty-two hands and sixteen legs. Kinley Dorjee, Iconography in Buddhism, Thimphu, Bhutan: Blue Poppy, 2018, 63.

A mind machine (aka brain machine or light and sound machine) uses pulsing rhythmic sound, flashing light, electrical or magnetic fields, or a combination of these, to alter the frequency of the user's brainwaves.The Use of Auditory and Visual Stimulation for the Treatment of Attention Deficit Hyperactivity Disorder in Children. Micheletti, Larry S. Doctoral Dissertation, University of Houston, Houston, Texas Mind machines can induce deep states of relaxation, concentration, and in some cases altered states of consciousness, which have been compared to those obtained from meditation and shamanic exploration. Photic mind machines work with flickering lights embedded in sunglasses or a lamp that sits on a tripod above your head or facing you. You then \\"Watch\\" with your eyes closed. The process applied by some of these machines is said to induce brainwave synchronisation or entrainment. History The influence of rhythmic sounds and drums to enter altered states of consciousness is used in different indigenous tribes (see Shamanic music), as well as optical stimulation produced by the flickering light of camp fires or pressing lightly on the eyeballs. This ‚Äústroboscopic photo-stimulation produces \\"photic driving\\", the alpha type of brain electrical activity associated with an altered state in which people are susceptible to suggestion.‚Äù ( p. 12). The first scientific observations were made by William Charles Wells in the 1790s who described different effects of binocular vision. His results were later transferred to be applied in binaural beats. Visual experiments with flickering lights were conducted in the 1940s by William Grey Walter who used stroboscopic light flashes to measure their effects on brain activity, assessed with EEG. He reported effect not just on visual areas but on the whole cortex. During the '60s and '70s the interest in different methods to induce altered states without the use of drugs were rising. Some of the induced states by rhythmic light and sound combinations were even described as psychedelic-like, while these claims lack adequate measurements for their similarity. In this line, numerous nightclubs began using strobes to maximize the effects of the music for dancing. The development of alpha EEG feedback (see neurofeedback) is an important starting point for biofeedback and its explicit use for entering altered states of consciousness. In these decades, Jack Schwarz built one of the first mind machines using rhythmic sounds and variable frequency lights in goggles to produce certain mental states. Enterprises started to produce different types of mind machines and some scientists followed the line of research to explore if and how these devices elicit effects on brain processes. In the late 1980s and early 1990s Farley initiated an investigation concerning medical claims made by some manufacturers and sellers. The FDA concluded that Light and Sound Machines were not medical devices and did not warrant regulation. Sellers and manufacturers were given guidelines for how they could advertise these devices, and were required to include a disclaimer and cautionary document with each machine. Nowadays, mind machines are rediscovered by some teenage cultures as so called ‚Äúdigital drugs‚Äù, a legal way to enter altered states of consciousness.  Application  Mind machines include flashing light devices, which are similar to the Brion Gysin dreamachine in that both produce a flickering visual field. Unlike flashing light devices, the dreamachine can be used by several people at once, but has few, if any, technical features. = Technical setting = A Brion Gysin Dreammachine.Mind machines typically consist of a control unit, a pair of headphones and/or strobe light goggles. The unit controls the sessions and drives the LEDs in the goggles. Professionally, they are usually referred to as Auditory Visual Stimulation Devices (AVS devices). Also mind machines are offered that can connect to the Internet for updates download of new session material. = Application rate = One session normally takes between 15 and 60 minutes. During a session the user should lie relaxed, and place the glasses on the eyes, which should remain closed during the whole session. Many machines have pre-programmed sessions which vary in parameters like light brightness, audio pitch or beat frequency but also give the opportunity for the user to create a custom session. Typically one session consists of a series of segments. Within one segment parameters change in a constant way. Mind machines are often used together with biofeedback or neurofeedback equipment in order to adjust the frequency on the fly, while proof for their effectiveness is lacking.  Description of altered states  = Perceptual changes = Light & sound mind machines can have various effects on the user. Most users describe seeing a flashing light, others perceive swirling patterns that have been compared to psychedelic light shows or fractals. A few users report seeing detailed, virtual reality like scenes. But also tactile and emotional changes are reported after a 6 Hz photic stimulation, as well as auditory hallucinations like binaural beats. = Changes in brain activity = Sessions will typically aim to address the target frequencies which correspond to delta (1-3 hertz), theta (4‚Äì7 Hz), alpha (8‚Äì12 Hz) or beta brain waves (13‚Äì40 Hz). Those frequency bands can be adjusted by the user based on the desired effects. For relaxation, often a reduction from beta waves to lower alpha or theta frequencies is observed. It is aimed to reach a level of ‚Äúslow alpha‚Äù (8 Hz). Glickson (1986) states that an alpha frequency of 10 Hz is optimal for perceiving visual hallucinations. He assumes that it's the change in alpha activity and not the alpha activity itself that is facilitating an altered state of consciousness. = After effects = Even if research is not sufficient so far, Michael Hutchison and other scientists report strong tranquilizing effects that lasted up to 3 days. After several sessions it is observed that users can produce a desired brain state with the associated brainwaves easier and deliberately.  Other information  = Therapeutic Use = Clinical research has been done on the use of auditory and visual stimulation to improve cognitive abilities in learning-disabled children as well as in the treatment of autism and attention deficit hyperactivity disorder (ADHD). However, lacking enough evidence to conclude that these treatments show efficacy, several studies indicate the potential to increase effects on IQ and reading levels in primary students (cite Olmstead, 2005), but also improvements in inattention and impulsiveness in children with ADHD (cite Siever). =Safety= Rapidly flashing lights may be dangerous for people with photosensitive epilepsy or other nervous disorders. It is thought that one out of 10,000 adults will experience a seizure while viewing such a device; about twice as many children will have a similar ill effect. =Regulation= Mind machine devices are legally available throughout the United States from many sources. With some exceptions, these devices commonly do not have FDA approval for medical applications in the USA. They have been found by a U.S. district court to be Class III medical devices, and consequentially require FDA pre-market approval for all medical uses. One company making medical claims for a possibly unsafe device has been shut down and seen their devices destroyed.

He has been credited with having developed the modern hand grenade and land mine just prior to World War I. Biography Aasen was born at Stadsbygd in Rissa, Norway. He graduated in 1903 from the Fortress-Artillery School for Non-Commissioned Officers () at Oscarsborg Fortress. He started his experiments developing a hand grenade while serving as a sergeant at Oscarsborg. He was encouraged in his work by base commander and former defense minister Hans Georg Stang. However, the Norwegian Department of Defense showed little interest in Aasen's prototype. He then formed Aasen's Grenade Company (Det Aasenske Granatkompani) in Copenhagen, Denmark, which produced and exported of his grenade throughout Europe. Apart from new types of explosives, trench mortars, airplane bombs and land mines he also created several inventions for civil use. However, it was the development and production of arms that would bring him his greatest success. Just prior to World War I, Aasen developed an anti-personnel mine which was meant as a weapon of deterrence. The invention caused enthusiasm within the French military but did not see production before the war. During World War I, Aasen was given the task of producing hand grenades for the French Army. He would have 13 factories with 13,000 employees working throughout the war. In 1917 his hand grenade was finally adopted by the Norwegian army, which later promoted him to premier-lieutenant (L√∏ytnant). Throughout his life he received a number of honorary degrees and awards for his inventions. Most notably, he was made an honorary colonel in the French Army, and a Chevalier in the order of the L√©gion d'honneur in 1915. Later, Aasen's personal fortune was greatly reduced as a result of bad financial speculations, and because he had never patented the rights to several of his inventions. He died from tuberculosis in Stoughton, Wisconsin at the age of 47.

Svatopluk's career started in the 860s, when he governed a principality within Moravia, the location of which is still a matter of debate among historians, under the suzerainty of his uncle, Rastislav. In 870 Svatopluk dethroned Rastislav, who was a vassal of Louis the German, and betrayed him to the Franks. Within a year, however, the Franks also imprisoned Svatopluk.Spiesz et al. 2006, p. 21. After the Moravians rebelled against the Franks, Svatopluk was released and led the rebels to victory over the invaders. Although he was obliged to pay tribute to East Francia under the peace treaty concluded at Forchheim (Germany) in 874, he was able to expand his territories outside the Franks' sphere of interest in the following years. His forces even invaded the March of Pannonia within East Francia in 882. Svatopluk established a good relationship with the popes, and he and his people were formally taken under the protection of the Holy See in 880. Pope Stephen V even addressed him as \\"King\\" in a letter written in 885. Svatopluk seems to have wanted to appease the German clergy who opposed the conducting of the liturgy in Old Church Slavonic, and he expelled the disciples of Methodius from Moravia in 886, after their teacher's death. Svatopluk's state was a loose assemblage of principalities and also included conquered territories. Not long after his death Svatopluk's realm of Great Moravia collapsed in the midst of a power struggle between his sons and the intensifying Hungarian raids.Spiesz et al. 2006, p. 311. Svatopluk, whose empire encompassed parts of the territory of modern Czech Republic (Moravia and Bohemia), Slovakia, Poland and Hungary, has occasionally been inaccurately presented as a \\"Slovak King\\" in Slovak literary works since the 18th century, the period of the Slovak national awakening.  Early years  The Annals of Fulda refer to Svatopluk as a nephew of Rastislav, the second known ruler of Great Moravia. Svatopluk was most probably born around 840. His father's name was Svetimir, according to the late 12th-century Chronicle of the Priest of Duklja, a medieval historical work long dismissed as a collection of fact and fiction. According to the unproven later Moravian tradition of Tom√°≈° Pe≈°ina z ƒåechorodu (17th century), who fulfilled the family tree of the House of Mojm√≠r, Svatopluk was the son of a certain Bogislav. Svatopluk seems to have risen to power in Great Moravia in the early 860s. The Life of Methodius relates that Svatopluk and his uncle jointly asked the Byzantine Emperor Michael III to send missionaries who were familiar with the Slavic tongue to Moravia. Michael III chose two brothers, Cyril and Methodius, who were fluent in the dialect of Slavic spoken in the environs of Thessaloniki (Greece). They arrived in Moravia in 863, and immediately set to work teaching and preaching. Their translation of liturgical texts into Old Church Slavonic was approved by Pope Hadrian II in 867.  Beginning of his reign  Statue of Svatopluk I in Lo≈°tice, Czech Republic By the time Svatopluk first appeared in a Frankish source (the Annals of Fulda), in 869, he was ruler of his own \\"realm\\" (regnum) within Great Moravia. His court was at \\"Rastislav's old city\\" (urbs antique Rastizi), which may have been either at Star√© Mƒõsto whose name literally means \\"old city\\" in Czech, or at Nitra (Slovakia), but it has also been identified with Sirmium (Sremska Mitrovica in Serbia). Svatopluk's \\"realm\\" was invaded and plundered in 869 by Bavarian troops led by Carloman, the eldest son of Louis the German, King of East Francia. At the same time Franconian and Alamannian troops attacked Rastislav's territories under the leadership of the same King's youngest son, Charles the Fat. Although the two armies soon returned, Svatopluk entered into clandestine negotiations with Carloman, and agreed to commend himself and his principality to Carloman. Having learned of this agreement, Rastislav is said to have become furious and set a trap for his nephew, inviting him to a banquet where he intended to have him murdered. Svatopluk, however, was warned of his uncle's plans, took Rastislav prisoner and handed him over to Carloman. Rastislav was sent to Bavaria under guard, while Carloman annexed his realm outright. As a reward for capturing Rastislav, Carloman allowed Svatopluk to retain his principality, but the rest of Great Moravia was placed under the control of two Frankish lords, William and Engilschalk. Carloman's forces also captured Methodius, whom Pope Hadrian II had earlier appointed Archbishop of Sirmium with jurisdiction over the realms ruled by Rastislav and Svatopluk. Early in 871 Carloman also imprisoned Svatopluk on unspecified charges of disloyalty, which may have been connected to the rebellion of Carloman's younger brothers, Louis the Younger and Charles the Bald.Goldberg 2006, pp. 306., 309. Believing that Svatopluk was dead, the Moravians selected another member of their ruling family named Slavom√≠r and made him their ruler.  Towards the Peace of Forchheim  Carloman soon came to the conclusion that the accusations against Svatopluk were unfounded and released him from prison. In order to bind Svatopluk to his family, Carloman had Svatopluk stand as godfather to his illegitimate grandson. Thus this son of Carloman's son Arnulf received the Moravian name Zwentibold. Svatopluk also agreed to lead Carloman's armies against Slavom√≠r and the rebellious Moravians. However, on his arrival at \\"Rastislav's old city\\", Svatopluk betrayed the Bavarians and conspired secretly with the rebels. Although he captured the fortress in accordance with Carloman's plan, once he was inside its walls he renounced his loyalty to Carloman, rallied a large Moravian force and launched a devastating surprise attack on the unsuspecting Bavarian army encamped outside. The Moravians took a great number of soldiers hostage, killed the rest and rid Moravia of the Frankish occupation. Carloman's governors, William and Engelschalk, were also both slain, and Svatopluk became the undisputed ruler of Great Moravia. The ruins of a Moravian fort on Kostolec Hill at Ducov√© (Slovakia) In October 871 Louis the German sent Bavarian and Franconian troops against the Bohemians (Czechs). During the campaign the Franconians surprised a party of Moravians somewhere near the traps that guarded the narrow approaches to a Bohemian fort. The Moravians were returning to their homeland with the daughter of a Bohemian dux (\\"duke\\"), presumably to marry an unidentified Moravian magnate. Although the Moravians managed to reach the safety of the fort, they had to abandon 644 fully equipped horses in the narrows. The marriage of a Bohemian leader's daughter to a Moravian magnate implies that Svatopluk was planning to form an alliance with the Bohemians. Louis the German realized the grave threat posed by Svatopluk and assembled forces for a multipronged expedition with pincer movements advancing on Moravian territory from several directions in 872. One army was sent out \\"against the Moravian Slavs\\" from Regensburg (Germany) in May, but the Thuringian and Saxon soldiers fled in their first encounter with the enemy. The second army, composed of Franconians under Bishop Arn of W√ºrzburg and Abbot Sigihard of Fulda, experienced mixed results: although their forces fought well, the majority of the men were killed, and only a handful of survivors returned to East Francia. Finally a third force, consisting of Bavarians and Carantanians under Carloman's command, laid Moravian territories to waste, put Svatopluk's army to flight and forced it to take refuge in an \\"extremely well fortified stronghold\\". Svatopluk, however, soon assembled a large army and attacked the Bavarians who had been left behind under the command of Bishop Emriacho of Regensburg to guard ships on the bank of the river Danube. In May 873, Pope John VIII moved energetically to discover the whereabouts of Methodius, who was still being held prisoner in Bavaria. He sent harshly worded letters to Carloman and the Bavarian bishops, and commanded Methodius's immediate reinstatement. The Pope seems also to have brokered a lasting peace between Louis the German and Svatopluk. After his meeting with the Pope at Verona (Italy), Louis the German went to Forchheim where, according to the Annals of Fulda, \\"he received the legates of Svatopluk asking for a peace treaty\\". The exact terms of their agreement are not known, but it seems to have been a compromise: Svatopluk was forced to make an annual payment of tribute to Louis the German, who agreed to avoid any hostile acts against Great Moravia. Thus Methodius, who had in the meantime been allowed to return to Moravia, could continue his work in relatively peaceful conditions for some years.  Years of expansion  The papal letter Scire vos volumus, written in 879 by Pope John VIII to Svatopluk ISure and disputed territories of Great Moravia under Svatopluk I (according to modern historians) Great Moravia underwent considerable expansion in the 870s. For instance, the Life of Methodius refers to the capture of \\"a very powerful pagan prince settled on the Vistula\\" in territory of later Poland, and a letter written around 900 by Archbishop Theotmar of Salzburg states that Svatopluk conquered the region of Nitra, which had been thereto inhabited by pagans. Modern historiography, however, has tended to question the claims that huge neighboring territories were permanently annexed by Great Moravia. For instance, there is little clear archaeological or written evidence of a permanent extension of Moravian power in Lesser Poland or to the west in Silesia, or in Pannonia, as is suggested in earlier historical works. Svatopluk's expansionist policy was perhaps so successful because most of Western Europe was in the grip of unusually savage and large-scale Viking raids between 879 and 886. On the other hand, the Life of Methodius directly links Svatopluk's military achievements and Methodius' work. For instance, according to his Life, Methodius promised Svatopluk that if the Prince would celebrate Saint Peter's Day in the Archbishop's church, \\"God will soon deliver\\" his enemies to him, and \\"so it came to pass\\". Nevertheless, at the court of Svatopluk, who himself professed the Latin Rite, intrigues against Methodius and the liturgy in Old Church Slavonic gathered strength. Svatopluk sent John of Venice, a known opponent of the Slavic liturgy, to Rome in 879 to achieve a settlement of ecclesiastical differences. In a letter addressed to Methodius in the same year, the Pope sharply rebuked him for using Slavonic in church services. Methodius, however, travelled to Rome in 880, together with a Moravian delegation. Under his influence Pope John VIII changed his mind and in a letter, known for its incipit, Industriae tuae, the Pope repeated that Mass was to be sung in Latin whenever requested, but he also allowed the use of Slavonic liturgy. The letter also confirmed the decision taken by the Holy See during Rastislav's reign to create an archdiocese for Great Moravia. Upon Svatopluk's request the Pope promoted a German priest, Wiching, to be Bishop of Nitra, but he added that the new Bishop and all the clerics in Great Moravia were expected to be obedient to Methodius, who remained the head of the church in Svatopluk's realms.  The \\"Wilhelminer War\\"  At the time when Charles the Fat became the sole ruler of East Francia in 881, the sons of Wilhelm and Engelschalk, the one-time commanders of the Bavarian forces occupying Moravia in 870-871, began to conspire with various Bavarian magnates in order to eject Arbo, the margrave Louis the German had appointed to command a key part of East Francia's frontier on the Danube. Arbo, however, appealed for and received help from both Charles the Fat and Svatopluk, and even handed his son over to the latter as a hostage. Upon Arbo's request, Svatopluk, who remembered \\"how much evil he along with his people had suffered\\" at the hands of Wilhelm and Engelschalk, attacked their sons. His forces soon captured Engelschalk's second son who was mutilated at Svatopluk's order. Thereafter the remaining sons withdrew from the authority of Charles the Fat and become the men of Carloman's son, Arnulf, who was ruling in Pannonia at that time.Bowlus 1994, pp. 211., 215. Learning of this, Svatopluk sent ambassadors to Arnulf, demanding that the sons of Wilhelm and Engelschalk be immediately sent away. Arnulf, however, refused to hand them over, to which Svatopluk responded with further invasions. In addition to the Franks and Moravians, the Bulgarians also entered the conflict by invading Svatopluk's realm.Bowlus 1994, pp. 214., 334. According to a record in the Annals of Salzburg, the region of Vienna (Austria) was also invaded in 881 by Hungarians. They seem to have been hired either by Svatopluk or by Arnulf in order to intervene in their conflict. Thus the \\"Willhelminer War\\", that was to last until 884, led to the devastation of Pannonia east of the river R√°ba. Finally, Charles the Fat himself turned up and received Svatopluk as his man at Kaumberg (Germany), receiving promises of peace and fidelity. Svatopluk also promised never to invade Charles the Fat's realm with a hostile force as long as he lived, while Charles the Fat recognized him as a prince of his realm. Peace between Arnulf and Svatopluk, however, was only sealed in the latter part of the following year.  Last years  Methodius, who seems to have been in Svatopluk's train at Kaumberg, died in 885. In his last days he had indicated Gorazd, one of his Moravian disciples, as most worthy to succeed him. Gorazd, however, did not or could not immediately submit his candidature for ratification of the Holy See, because Bishop Wiching of Nitra soon hurried to Rome. He persuaded Pope Stephen V that Methodius had ignored Pope John VIII's orders in the matter of Slavonic liturgy, and thus, upon his initiative, the pope prohibited the Slavonic liturgy in Moravia. The pope also sent a letter (Quia te zelo) to Svatopluk, urging him to accept the addition of filioque to the Creed and to give up such peculiar Byzantine practices as fasting on Saturday. Wiching having arrived back from Rome, Svatopluk summoned Gorazd, Clement and Methodius's other disciples to submit to the papal directions. When they refused to do so, Svatopluk gave Wiching a free hand to take action against them. Some of them were first thrown into prison, and soon expelled from Moravia, while others, among them Naum, were sold as slaves. The expulsion of Methodius's disciples from Moravia signaled the end of the Slavonic liturgy in Central Europe. The exiles, however, subsequently found refuge in the First Bulgarian Empire where they were able to carry on their work.Spiesz et al. 2006, p. 24. Saint Clement of Ochrid said: In his letter Quia te zelo, the pope addressed Svatopluk as rex Sclavorum (\\"king of the Slavs\\"). Although Svatopluk's royal title was not recognized by the contemporary Annals of Fulda, the chronicler Regino of Pr√ºm also referred to Svatopluk as rex Marahensium Sclavorum (\\"king of the Moravian Slavs\\") in the early 10th century, which is independent evidence confirming that Svatopluk held the title of king. According to the late 12th-century Chronicle of the Priest of Duklja, Svatopluk had been crowned \\"king in the Roman fashion on the field of Dalma\\" in the presence of a papal legate, cardinals, and bishops. In 887 Arnulf, Svatopluk's opponent in the \\"Wilhelminer War\\", became the king of East Francia. They met at Omuntesperch, a locality that has yet not been identified, during the winter of 890. At the meeting Svatopluk transmitted to Arnulf a message from Pope Stephen V, urging the king to invade Italy to protect the Holy See. According to Regino of Pr√ºm, the two monarchs also concluded an agreement, in which Arnulf ceded the ducatus of the Bohemians to Svatopluk. Sometime during 891, according to the Annals of Fulda, Arnulf sent an embassy led by margrave Arbo to Moravia in order to renew the peace. A letter written by the margrave soon announced that the legates were returning from Svatopluk and the Moravians who had agreed \\"to give themselves in friendship\\". Svatopluk, however, broke his pledges, so Arnulf decided to invade Moravia in 891. First the king met with Braslav, the Slavic dux on the river Sava, then raised an army of Franconians, Bavarians and Alamanni, and also recruited Hungarians to join his campaign. In the late 10th century, Arnulf was accused by Ottonian authors of unleashing the Hungarians on Europe because of his desire to bring down Moravia. Arnulf's invasion started in July 892, but he failed to defeat Svatopluk. The war against Moravia seems to have continued until 894. This was the year of Svatopluk's \\"most unlucky death\\", according to the Annals of Fulda, which implies that he met his end in some kind of mishap, the sort that occurs in war. The exact circumstances of Svatopluk's death, however, are unknown.  Legacy  Following Svatopluk's death, Great Moravia, which had achieved its maximum territorial extension, and exercised its greatest influence in his reign, ceased to be a political factor in Central Europe.Kirschbaum 2005, pp. 29., 39. Among the conquered peoples, the Czechs were the first to withdraw in 895. Although--at least, according to the testimony of the Byzantine Emperor Constantine Porphyrogenitus--Svatopluk had made a deathbed request to his sons, Mojmir II of Moravia and Svatopluk II, that they remain united, after his death internal disagreements between them were fostered by Arnulf. Finally Moravia collapsed in the first decade of the 10th century due to the invasion of the Hungarians. The legend of Svatopluk's three wands Svatopluk I disguised as a monk in the court of Arnulf, King of East Francia (from the 14th-century Chronicle of Dalimil) According to Hungarian legends, the Hungarians purchased the country from Svatopluk in a symbolic act of exchange: they sent a white horse with saddler to Svatopluk in return for some earth, water and grass, supposed to represent his country itself. Svatopluk allegedly disavowed this \\"contract\\" and then drowned in the Danube in flight from the Hungarians. The legend, in fact, seems to merely describe a common pagan rite of concluding alliances which might refer to Svatopluk's alliance with the Hungarians in 894. Historian Ryszard Grzesik says that the ruler Menumorut, mentioned in the 13th-century chronicle Gesta Hungarorum was the \\"personification\\" of Svatopluk I of Moravia. Nevertheless, in 1722 Michael Bencsik, a professor of Hungarian law at the University of Trnava, suggested that the nobility and the whole population of Trencs√©n county within the Kingdom of Hungary were \\"the remnants of Svatopluk who sold his country to the Hungarians, and thus the Slovak people, into eternal serfdom\\". In response, J√°n Baltaz√°r Magin, the Roman Catholic pastor of Dubnica, wrote the oldest known defense of the Slovak nation in 1728. Next another Catholic priest, Juraj F√°ndly, completed a history in Latin entitled Compendiata historia gentis Slavae (\\"A Brief History of the Slovak Nation\\") in which he depicted Moravia as a state of Slovaks and Svatopluk as their king. In 1833 the poet J√°n Holl√Ω published a poem entitled Sv√§topluk, the first of a series of epic poems dealing with the past of the Slovak people.

Hexter (May 25, 1910 ‚Äì December 8, 1996) was an American historian, a specialist in Tudor and seventeenth century British history, and well known for his comments on historiography. Early career Hexter was born in Memphis, Tennessee and was awarded a BA by the University of Cincinnati in 1931. He received his MA (1933) and PhD (1937) from Harvard University. His research interests encompassed both political and intellectual history, as witnessed by his first two books, one a history of the parliamentary conflict leading up to the Civil War, and the other a nuanced textual interpretation of Thomas More's Utopia. Scholarship and historiography Hexter's scholarly reputation probably owes as much to his historiographical critiques as to his body of research. He is noted for his distinction between \\"splitters\\" and \\"lumpers\\" of historical material, and his 1975 attack on Christopher Hill (as a \\"lumper\\" of selectively read sources). More to Hexter's fancy was the \\"splitter\\" who saw his responsibility to the full range of particulars and the ambiguity of historical sources. \\"Lumping\\" was the tendency that, according to Hexter, threatened to bind historians to overreaching generalizations, of which he suggested Marxism was the most typical and intellectually pernicious. Nonetheless, his essay appeared to argue that both tendencies (analysis and synthesis) were intellectually necessary. Storm over the gentry This attack continued from a position he had earlier assumed, in his response in the late 1950s to a debate between Lawrence Stone and Hugh Trevor-Roper. Stone, along with R.H. Tawney, explained the origins of the English Civil War by positing that an increasingly well-off and ambitious gentry had, over the course of many years, destabilized the English state in which power had traditionally been divided between the aristocracy and the king. Trevor-Roper inverted this theory, arguing that in fact the Civil War was caused in part by court gentry who had fallen on bad times. Hexter's contribution, puckishly titled \\"The Storm over the Gentry\\" and originally published in a popular magazine, contends that both theses are undermined by their authors' social determinism which causes them to overlook the ordinary business of the House of Commons. Hexter maintained that the overlooked group, the rural magnates, the wealthier of the country gentry, wielded the most influence in the House of Commons and had brought no real interest in revolution. To the contrary, their experience was in practical management and governance, and for the most part they did not act out of simple self-interest. The Civil War needs, therefore, to be seen as the story of how such solid, service-minded and economically comfortable men were persuaded to resist the King, and not as any particular group's economically motivated power grab. His ultimate self- definition was overtly, unabashedly, and often polemically whiggish. For Hexter, the English Civil War was to be seen as the defence of traditional English liberties against an aggressive Crown. This position contrasted in the 1970s with the revisionist views of Conrad Russell and others who disputed both the uniqueness of the English Civil War and its connection with ideas of liberty. However, inasmuch as the revisionists were also explicitly anti- Marxist, their stance owed a great deal to Hexter's critiques. Russell in particular echoed Hexter's emphasis on continuity in English political values, Hexter's distinction between the Civil War and the subsequent Revolution, and Hexter's belief that contingencies better explained the coming of the War, while rejecting Hexter's view that Parliament was acting out of a clear-cut sense of constitutional obligation and embracing instead the view that religious conflicts and practical problems in the composite monarchy were more decisive. Hexter in 1978 wrote a bitter historiographical review in which he attacked younger scholars for reducing the analysis of the Civil War to an essentially amoral struggle for power (socio-economic for the Marxists; religious, political and fiscal for the revisionists), which he argued was too dismissive of the intrinsic moral strength of Parliament's position. He thus declared his preference for the 19th-century narrative by Samuel Rawson Gardiner over the new interpretation, and, true to form, even adopted an exaggerated Whig-style argument: that one should recognize and accept the principles of the Parliamentary rebels because these ideas about freedom were the very foundation for our modern sense of political liberty. Hexter on Braudel Another famous Hexterian intervention in historiography is his article \\"Fernand Braudel and the Monde Braudellien,\\" which can be seen as a more appreciative, temperate, and intellectually sophisticated antecedent to Hexter's attack on Hill. Here, Hexter dissected Braudel's vast \\"geohistory,\\" La Mediteran√©e, marvelling at the organization of the Annales School but pointing out the ironic tensions between the Annales' rigorous, collaborative, scientific institutional ethos and its leader's passionate, highly personal, often factually inaccurate or poorly sourced book (for which much of the intellectual labor was carried out from memory while Braudel was in a prisoner-of-war camp). The article also reveals Hexter's satirical touch, as, in its first section, Hexter mimics the quantitative bent of the Annales scholars, representing their output in a series of graphs and tables. Academic positions His most prominent academic positions were at Queens College of the City University of New York from 1938 until 1957, Washington University in St. Louis from 1957 until 1964, and at Yale University from 1964 to 1978, becoming Charles Still√© Professor. The Yale Center for Parliamentary History was founded in 1966 under his directorship. He then returned to Washington University, where he founded the Center for the History of Freedom, and was named John M. Olin Professor Emeritus of the History of Freedom at Washington University, retiring in 1990. In this stead, he served as the founder and editor of the Stanford University Press Making of Modern Freedom series of books. Family Hexter married Ruth Mullin in 1942; they had four children. He died of congestive heart failure in St. Louis, Missouri after suffering heart ailments for much of his adult life.

Some were in silver mounts with filigree, the mounting covering the back of the lens, and were probably used as jewellery; it has been suggested that the lenses themselves are much older than their mounts. Some of the lenses can be seen at the Fornsal historical museum in Visby, while some are in the Swedish National Museum in Stockholm, and others have been lost. It was reported by Otto Ahlstr√∂m in 1950 that most have aspheric surfaces. The best of the lenses have low spherical aberration, indicating that their surface profile was optimized to improve image quality. Most of the lenses, however, do not show any sign of optimization and produce worse images than a simple spherical lens. Description Aspheric lens as measured by Karl-Heinz Wilms The lenses are bi-aspheric and two of them have very good imaging properties. Their surface appears to be an oblate ellipse, while the surface nearest the eye approaches a parabola. Dr. Olaf Schmidt has reported that their surface is an almost perfect elliptical shape and that they were obviously made on an early form of lathe. The best example of the lenses measures in diameter and has a thickness of at its centre, with an angular resolution of 25‚Äì30 Œºm. The Visby lenses provide evidence that sophisticated lens-making techniques were being used by artisans over 1,000 years ago, at a time when researchers had only just begun to explore the laws of refraction. According to Schmidt and his co-workers, it is clear that the artisans worked by trial and error, since the mathematics to calculate the best form for a lens were not discovered until several hundred years later. It has been suggested that the knowledge required to make such lenses was restricted to only a few people, and perhaps only one. Excavations at Fr√∂jel on Gotland in 1999 discovered evidence of local manufacture of beads and lenses from rock crystal, with unworked pieces of crystal coexisting with partially finished beads and lenses. Prior to the Fr√∂jel finds it had been suggested that the lenses were not produced by the Vikings, as there are hints that they were in fact produced in Byzantium or Eastern Europe. The Vikings of Gotland were known to have participated in trade networks that reached as far as Constantinople. Proposed uses Various uses have been proposed for the lenses. They may have been used by artisans for magnification in fine work, as reading stones, or to start fires.Viking Age Fire-Steels and Strike-A-Lights Olaf Schmidt has speculated that they may have been used as part of a telescope.

It can also be used to treat excessive hair growth in women and as a part of hormone therapy for transgender women. It is taken by mouth. Finasteride is a 5Œ±-reductase inhibitor and therefore an antiandrogen. It works by decreasing the production of dihydrotestosterone (DHT) by about 70%, including in the prostate gland and the scalp. Side effects from finasteride are rare, however some men experience sexual dysfunction, depression, and breast enlargement. In some men, sexual dysfunction may persist after stopping the medication. It may also hide the early symptoms of certain forms of prostate cancer. Finasteride was patented in 1984 and approved for medical use in 1992. It is available as a generic medication. In 2017, it was the 86th-most commonly prescribed medication in the United States, with more than nine million prescriptions. Medical uses Finasteride is indicated for the treatment of symptomatic benign prostatic hyperplasia (BPH) in men with an enlarged prostate and for the treatment of male pattern hair loss (androgenetic alopecia) in men. =Enlarged prostate= Physicians sometimes prescribe finasteride for the treatment of benign prostatic hyperplasia (BPH), informally known as an enlarged prostate. Finasteride may improve the symptoms associated with BPH such as difficulty urinating, getting up during the night to urinate, hesitation at the start and end of urination, and decreased urinary flow. It provides less symptomatic relief than alpha-1 blockers such as tamsulosin and symptomatic relief is slower in onset (six months or more of treatment with finasteride may be required to determine the therapeutic results of treatment). Symptomatic benefits are mainly seen in those with prostate volume > 40 cm3. In long-term studies finasteride but not alpha-1 inhibitors reduce the risk of acute urinary retention (‚àí57% at 4 years) and the need for surgery (‚àí54% at 4 years). If the drug is discontinued, any therapeutic benefits are reversed within about 6‚Äì8 months. =Scalp hair loss= Finasteride is also used to treat male pattern baldness (androgenic alopecia) in men, a condition that develops in up to 80% of Caucasian men.Kanti V1, Messenger A2, Dobos G1, Reygagne P3, Finner A4, Blumeyer A5, Trakatelli M6, Tosti A7,8, Del Marmol V9, Piraccini BM10, Nast A11, Blume-Peytavi U1.

Epub 2017 Nov 27. In the United States, finasteride and minoxidil are the only two FDA approved drugs for the treatment of male pattern hair loss as of 2017. Treatment with finasteride slows further hair loss and provides about 30% improvement in hair loss after six months of treatment, with effectiveness persisting as long as the drug is taken. Taking finasteride leads to a reduction in scalp and serum DHT levels; by lowering scalp levels of DHT, finasteride can maintain or increase the amount of terminal hairs in the anagen phase by inhibiting and sometimes reversing miniaturization of the hair follicle. Finasteride is most effective on the crown but can reduce hair loss in all areas of the scalp. Finasteride has also been tested for pattern hair loss in women; however, the results were no better than placebo. =Prostate cancer= In males over 55 years old finasteride decreases the risk of low grade prostate cancer but may increase the risk of high grade prostate cancer and has no effect on overall survival. A 2010 review found a 25% reduction in the risk of prostate cancer with 5Œ±-reductase inhibitor. A follow-up study of the Medicare claims of participants in a 10-year Prostate Cancer Prevention Trial suggests the reduction in prostate cancer is maintained even after discontinuation of treatment. However, 5Œ±-reductase inhibitors have been found to increase the risk of developing certain rare but aggressive forms of prostate cancer (27% risk increase), although not all studies have observed this. No impact of 5-Œ±-reductase inhibitor on survival has been found in people with prostate cancer. Excessive hair growth Finasteride has been found to be effective in the treatment of hirsutism (excessive facial and/or body hair growth) in women. In a study of 89 women with hyperandrogenism due to persistent adrenarche syndrome, finasteride produced a 93% reduction in facial hirsutism and a 73% reduction bodily hirsutism after 2 years of treatment. Other studies using finasteride for hirsutism have also found it to be clearly effective. =Transgender hormone therapy= Finasteride is sometimes used in hormone replacement therapy for transgender women due to its antiandrogenic effects, in combination with a form of estrogen. However, little clinical research of finasteride use for this purpose has been conducted and evidence of safety or efficacy is limited. Moreover, caution has been recommended when prescribing finasteride to transgender women, as finasteride may be associated with side effects such as depression, anxiety, and suicidal ideation, symptoms that are particularly prevalent in the transgender population and in others at high risk already. Adverse effects A 2010 Cochrane review concluded that adverse effects from finasteride are rare when used for BPH. When finasteride was originally approved for hair loss in 1997, the FDA reported that it appeared well tolerated, with the most common side effects being related to sexual function. Finasteride is contraindicated in pregnancy. The Food and Drug Administration advises that donation of blood or plasma be deferred for at least one month after taking the last dose of finasteride. The FDA has added a warning to 5Œ±-reductase inhibitors concerning an increased risk of high-grade prostate cancer, as the treatment of BPH lowers PSA (prostate-specific antigen), which could mask the development of prostate cancer.FDA. Posted 9 June 2011. 5-alpha reductase inhibitors (5-ARIs): Label Change ‚Äì Increased Risk of Prostate Cancer Although overall incidence of male breast cancer in clinical trials for finasteride 5 mg was not increased, there are post-marketing reports of breast cancer in association with its use, though available evidence does not provide clarity as to whether there is a causative relationship between finasteride and these cancers.Medicines and Healthcare products Regulatory Agency Drug Safety Update. December 2009 Finasteride: potential risk of male breast cancer A 2018 meta-analysis found no higher risk of breast cancer with 5Œ±-reductase inhibitors. Some men develop gynecomastia (breast development or enlargement) following finasteride usage. The risk of gynecomastia with 5Œ±-reductase inhibitors is low at about 1.5%. Depressive symptoms and suicidality have been reported. =Sexual dysfunction= Finasteride causes short-term sexual dysfunction in some men, which may persist in some men after stopping the medication. There are case reports of persistent diminished libido or erectile dysfunction after stopping the drug and the FDA has updated the label to inform people of these reports. The 2010 Cochrane review found that compared with placebo, men taking finasteride are at increased risk for impotence, erectile dysfunction, decreased libido, and ejaculation disorder for the first year of treatment. The risk of side effects were dose dependent, with a higher risk for men taking 5 mg in comparison to 1 mg. The rates also became indistinguishable from placebo after 2‚Äì4 years and these side effects usually got better over time. A 2016 meta-analysis found that sexual dysfunction, including erectile dysfunction, loss of libido, and reduced ejaculate, may occur in 3.4 to 15.8% of men treated with finasteride or dutasteride. This adverse effect has been linked to lower quality of life and can cause stress in relationships. =Long-term= Finasteride may cause persistent adverse sexual, neurological and physical effects in a subset of men. This has been called post-finasteride syndrome, characterized by reported sexual and physical symptoms such as loss of libidio, erectile dysfunction, ejaculatory disorders, reduction in penis size, penile curvature, reduced sensation, male breast enlargement, muscular atrophy, fatigue and severely dry skin. People with post-finasteride syndrome may experience depression and anxiety, cognitive impairment and suicidal thoughts. Post-finasteride syndrome may also have reduced levels of neurosteroids such as allopregnanolone in their cerebrospinal fluid. One study found that 1.4% developed persistent sexual dysfunction. A 2019 Reuters investigation showed that Merck found evidence of persistent side effects in their original clinical trials and did not disclose it in their warning label. They uncovered court filings which demonstrated that Merck misrepresented Propecia's safety record following clinical trials in the mid-late 1990s. In one deposition, Charlotte Merritt, who oversaw regulatory activity for Propecia, acknowledged that Merck changed Propecia's label for sexual adverse events in 2002, four years after Propecia hit the market. The label changed from ‚Äúresolution occurred in all men who discontinued therapy with Propecia ‚Äù to ‚Äúresolution occurred in men who discontinued therapy with Propecia‚Äù. Merritt testified that Merck eliminated the word ‚Äúall‚Äù due to evidence from the clinical trials of adverse events that did not resolve following discontinuation of use. In another deposition, Paul Howes, the head of marketing for Propecia acknowledged that Merck was aware that warnings of sexual side effects, particularly persistent to permanent side effects, would have a devastating impact on sales. Overdose Finasteride has been studied in humans at single doses of up to 400 mg and at continuous dosages of up to 80 mg/day for three months, without adverse effects observed. These doses are many times in excess of the typical dosages of finasteride of 1 mg/day and 5 mg/day that are used clinically. There is no specific recommended antidote for finasteride overdose. Interactions No significant drug interactions have been observed between finasteride and a limited selection of medications. Pharmacology =Pharmacodynamics= Finasteride is a 5Œ±-reductase inhibitor. It is specifically a selective inhibitor of the type II and III isoforms of the enzyme. By inhibiting these two isozymes of 5Œ±-reductase, finasteride reduces the formation of the potent androgen dihydrotestosterone (DHT) from its precursor testosterone in certain tissues in the body such as the prostate gland, skin, and hair follicles. As such, finasteride is a type of antiandrogen, or more specifically, an androgen synthesis inhibitor. However, some authors do not define finasteride as an \\"antiandrogen,\\" a term which can refer more specifically to antagonists of the androgen receptor. Finasteride results in a decrease of circulating DHT levels by about 65 to 70% with an oral dosage of 5 mg/day and of DHT levels in the prostate gland by up to 80 to 90% with an oral dosage of 1 or 5 mg/day. In parallel, circulating levels of testosterone increase by approximately 10%, while local concentrations of testosterone in the prostate gland increase by about 7-fold and local testosterone levels in hair follicles increase by around 27 to 53%. An oral dosage of finasteride of only 0.2 mg/day has been found to achieve near-maximal suppression of DHT levels (68.6% for 0.2 mg/day relative to 72.2% for 5 mg/day). Finasteride does not completely suppress DHT production because it lacks significant inhibitory effects on the 5Œ±-reductase type I isoenzyme, with more than 100-fold less inhibitory potency for type I as compared to type II ( = 313 nM and 11 nM, respectively). This is in contrast to inhibitors of all three isoenzymes of 5Œ±-reductase like dutasteride, which can reduce DHT levels in the entire body by more than 99%. In addition to inhibiting 5Œ±-reductase, finasteride has also been found to competitively inhibit 5Œ≤-reductase (AKR1D1). However, its affinity for the enzyme is substantially less than for 5Œ±-reductase (an order of magnitude less than for 5Œ±-reductase type I) and hence is unlikely to be of clinical significance. As of 2012, the tissues in which the different isozymes of 5Œ±-reductase are expressed are not fully clear. This is because different investigators have obtained varying results with different reagents, methods, and tissues examined. However, the different isozymes of 5Œ±-reductase appear to be widely expressed, with notable tissues including the prostate gland, seminal vesicles, testes, epididymides, skin, hair follicles, liver, kidneys, and brain, among others. By inhibiting 5Œ±-reductase and thus preventing DHT production, finasteride reduces androgen signaling in tissues like the prostate gland and the scalp. In the prostate, this reduces prostate volume, which improves BPH and reduces risk of prostate cancer. Finasteride reduces prostate volume by 20 to 30% in men with benign prostatic hyperplasia. Inhibition of 5Œ±-reductase also reduces epididymal weight, and decreases motility and normal morphology of spermatozoa in the epididymis. Neurosteroids like 3Œ±-androstanediol (derived from DHT) and allopregnanolone (derived from progesterone) activate the GABAA receptor in the brain; because finasteride prevents the formation of neurosteroids, it functions as a neurosteroidogenesis inhibitor and may contribute to a reduction of GABAA activity. Reduction of GABAA receptor activation by these neurosteroids has been implicated in depression, anxiety, and sexual dysfunction. =Pharmacokinetics= The mean oral bioavailability of finasteride is approximately 65%. The absorption of finasteride is not affected by food. At steady-state with 1 mg/day finasteride, mean peak concentrations of finasteride were 9.2 ng/mL (25 nmol/L). Conversely, following a single 5 mg dose of finasteride, mean peak levels of finasteride were 37 ng/mL (99 nmol/L), and plasma concentrations increased by 47 to 54% following 2.5 weeks of continued daily administration. The volume of distribution of finasteride is 76 L. Its plasma protein binding is 90%. The drug has been found to cross the blood‚Äìbrain barrier, whereas levels in semen were found to be undetectable. Finasteride is extensively metabolized in the liver, first by hydroxylation via CYP3A4 and then by aldehyde dehydrogenase. It has two major metabolites, which are the tert-butyl side chain monohydroxylated and monocarboxylic acid metabolites. These metabolites show approximately 20% of the inhibitory activity of finasteride on 5Œ±-reductase. Hence, the metabolites of finasteride are not particularly active. The drug has a terminal half-life of 5 to 6 hours in adult men (18‚Äì60 years of age) and a terminal half-life of 8 hours or more in elderly men (more than 70 years of age). It is eliminated as its metabolites 57% in the feces and 40% in the urine. Chemistry Finasteride, also known as 17Œ≤-(N-tert- butylcarbamoyl)-4-aza-5Œ±-androst-1-en-3-one, is a synthetic androstane steroid and 4-azasteroid. It is an analogue of androgen steroid hormones like testosterone and DHT. As an unconjugated steroid, finasteride is a highly lipophilic compound. History In 1942, James Hamilton observed that prepubertal castration prevents the later development of male pattern baldness in mature men. In 1974, Julianne Imperato-McGinley of Cornell Medical College in New York attended a conference on birth defects. She reported on a group of intersex children in the Caribbean who appeared sexually ambiguous at birth, and were initially raised as girls, but then grew external male genitalia and other masculine characteristic after onset of puberty. These children, despite being raised as girls until puberty, were generally heterosexual, and were termed \\"Guevedoces\\" by their local community, which means \\"penis at twelve\\" in Spanish. Her research group found these children shared a genetic mutation, causing deficiency of the 5Œ±-reductase enzyme and male hormone dihydrotestosterone (DHT), which was found to have been the etiology behind abnormalities in male sexual development. Upon maturation, these individuals were observed to have smaller prostates which were underdeveloped, and were also observed to lack incidence of male pattern baldness. In 1975, copies of Imperato-McGinley's presentation were seen by P. Roy Vagelos, who was then serving as Merck's basic-research chief. He was intrigued by the notion that decreased levels of DHT led to the development of smaller prostates. Dr. Vagelos then sought to create a drug which could mimic the condition found in these children to treat older men who were suffering from benign prostatic hyperplasia. Finasteride was developed by Merck under the code name MK-906. A team led by chemist Gary Rasmusson and biologist Jerry Brooks developed potential 5Œ±-reductase inhibitors based on transition state inhibitors, using an iterative process of molecular design, testing, and redesign. In 1992, finasteride (5 mg) was approved by the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) for treatment of BPH, which Merck marketed under the brand name Proscar. Rasmusson and Brooks were awarded IPO's ‚ÄúInventor of the Year‚Äù award in 1993 for their work on finasteride. In 1997, Merck was successful in obtaining FDA approval for a second indication of finasteride (1 mg) for treatment of male pattern hair loss, which was marketed under the brand name Propecia. It was the first 5Œ±-reductase inhibitor to be introduced and was followed by dutasteride in 2001. The first study of finasteride in the treatment of hirsutism in women was published in 1994. Society and culture = Economics = A month supply in the United Kingdom costs the NHS about per month as of 2019. In the United States, the wholesale cost of this amount is about . =Generic names= Finasteride is the generic name of the drug and its , , , and , while finast√©ride is its . It is also known by its former developmental code names MK-906, YM-152, and L-652,931. =Brand names= Finasteride is marketed primarily under the brand names Propecia, for pattern hair loss, and Proscar, for BPH, both of which are products of Merck & Co. There is 1 mg of finasteride in Propecia and 5 mg in Proscar. Merck's patent on finasteride for the treatment of BPH expired in June 2006. Merck was awarded a separate patent for the use of finasteride to treat pattern hair loss and it expired in November 2013. Finasteride is also marketed under a variety of other brand names throughout the world. =Controversy= Men in the U.S. and Canada concerned about persistent sexual side effects \\"coined the phrase 'post-finasteride syndrome', which they say is characterized by sexual, neurological, hormonal and psychological side effects that can persist in men who have taken finasteride for hair loss or an enlarged prostate\\". In 2016, Merck was a defendant in approximately 1,370 product liability lawsuits which had been filed by customers alleging they have experienced persistent sexual side effects following cessation of treatment with finasteride. =Athletics= From 2005 to 2009, the World Anti-Doping Agency banned finasteride because it was discovered that the drug could be used to mask steroid abuse. It was removed from the list effective January 1, 2009, after improvements in testing methods made the ban unnecessary. Athletes who used finasteride and were banned from international competition include skeleton racer Zach Lund, bobsledder Sebastien Gattuso, footballer Rom√°rio, and ice hockey goaltender Jos√© Th√©odore. =Miscellaneous= The U.S. Food and Drug Administration advises that donation of blood or plasma be deferred for at least one month after taking the last dose of finasteride. The UK also has a one-month deferral period. Harold Bornstein, the former personal physician of United States President Donald Trump, stated in 2017 that Trump was taking finasteride to promote hair growth. Research Preliminary research suggests that topical finasteride may be effective in the treatment of pattern hair loss. Topical finasteride, like the oral preparation, reduces serum DHT. However, studies have shown that the extent of the reduction of serum DHT is less with the topical application. DHT may be involved in the cause of acne, and 5Œ±-reductase inhibitors might be effective in the treatment of the condition. A small retrospective study reported that finasteride was effective in the treatment of acne in women with normal testosterone levels. A randomized controlled trial found that finasteride was less effective than flutamide or an ethinylestradiol/cyproterone acetate birth control pill in the treatment of acne in women with high androgen levels. Androgens and estrogens may be involved in the cause of hidradenitis suppurativa (acne inversa). Two case series have reported that finasteride is effective in the treatment of hidradenitis suppurativa in girls and women.

Line art of Belem She made her maiden voyage as a cargo ship in 1896, transporting sugar from the West Indies, cocoa, and coffee from Brazil and French Guiana to Nantes, France.  History  Belem escaped the eruption of Mount Pel√©e in Saint-Pierre, Martinique on 8 May 1902. On arriving at Saint Pierre ahead of the eruption, Captain Julien Chauvelon found that roadsteads were full of vessels. With no place to anchor the ship Chauvelon angrily decided to anchor some miles further away off a beach, which provided shelter when the volcano erupted. She was sold in 1914 to Hugh Grosvenor, 2nd Duke of Westminster, who converted her to his private luxurious pleasure yacht, complete with two auxiliary Bolinder Diesel engines of 300 HP each. In 1922 she became the property of Sir Arthur Ernest Guinness, of the Guinness family, who renamed her the Fant√¥me II and revised the rig from a square rigger. Hon. A.E. Guinness was Rear Commodore of the Royal St. George Yacht Club, in Kingstown, Ireland from 1921 to 1939. He was Vice Commodore from 1940 to 1948. Hon. A.E. Guinness took the F√¢ntome II on a great cruise in 1923 with his daughters Aileen, Maureen, and Oonagh.Derek Wilson, ‚ÄòPlunket , Aileen Sibell Mary (1904‚Äì1999)‚Äô, Oxford Dictionary of National Biography, Oxford University Press, 2004; online edn, Jan 2012 accessed 9 Oct 2017 They sailed the seven seas in making a travel round the world via the Panama and Suez Canals including a visit to Spitsbergen. During her approach to Yokohama harbour while sailing the Pacific Ocean the barque managed to escape another catastrophe - an earthquake which destroyed the harbour and parts of Yokohama city. Hon. Arthur E. Guinness died in 1949. The F√¢ntome II was moored in the roads of Cowes, Isle of Wight. In 1951 she was sold to the Venezian count Vittorio Cini, who named her the Giorgio Cini after his son, who had died in a plane crash near Cannes on 31 August 1949 . She was rigged to a barkentine and used as a sail training ship until 1965, when she was considered too old for further use and was moored at the Island of San Giorgio Maggiore, Venice. In 1972 the Italian carabinieri attempted to restore her to the original barque rig. When this proved too expensive, she became the property of the shipyard. In 1976 the ship was re-rigged to a barque. Finally, in January 1979, she came back to her home port as the Belem under tow by a French seagoing tug, flying the French flag after 65 years. Fully restored to her original condition, she began a new career as a sail training ship.

A humor columnist for Outdoor Life, Field & Stream, and other magazines,Statsio, Marilyn (2008) \\"Death Among the Gentry\\", The New York Times, March 23, 2008, retrieved 2011-07-29Frazier, Ian (1985) \\"Fast Mean Cows and Slow Mean Cows\\", The New York Times, December 15, 1985, retrieved 2011-07-29 his columns and stories have been collected in several books, beginning with A Fine and Pleasant Misery (1978) up through The Horse in My Garage and Other Stories (2012). Biography McManus was born and raised in Sandpoint, Idaho. His father, who served in the 42nd (\\"Rainbow\\") Division under Douglas MacArthur during World War I, died when Patrick was six. Although his mother later remarried, for the most part he was raised by his mother, grandmother, and older sister Patricia McManus Gass (referred to in his childhood stories as \\"the Troll\\"). His family didn't have much money and lived on a small farm on the banks of Sand Creek where they grew most of their own food. They had chickens, a milk cow and pigs and went hunting and fishing. After graduating from Sandpoint High School, McManus worked construction and other such jobs until he had saved enough money to attend Washington State College, now Washington State University, where he majored in journalism. From 1960 to 1983 he taught English, journalism and creative writing at Eastern Washington State College, now Eastern Washington University. He was married to Darlene \\"Bun\\" McManus and had four daughters. Works McManus wrote mostly about his outdoor adventures from his childhood with semi-fictional characters such as his old woodsman mentor Rancid Crabtree, his childhood friends Crazy Eddie Muldoon and Retch Sweeney, and his dog Strange. The stories' humor is mostly based on elaborate exaggerations of his surreal adventures in the outdoors. McManus's writing is characterized by a dry wit that has been compared to the writing styles of Mark Twain and Robert Benchley. His last published work was Circles in the Snow (2014), the sixth in a series of mystery novels starring the character Sheriff Bo Tully. Other departures from his column-collections include Kid Camping from Aaaaiii! To Zip (1979), an alphabetized, and partially serious, listing of useful tips and concepts for beginning campers; Whatchagot Stew (1989), both a cookbook and a less-fictionalized memoir of his childhood; and The Deer on a Bicycle (2000), a discussion of the art of humor writing. McManus also wrote five separate, distinct one-man comedies for his indentured actor, Tim Behrens. Tim has toured these shows to 21 states and two provinces in more than 1600 performances since 1992. They are: A Fine and Pleasant Misery; McManus In Love; Pot Luck; Poor Again...Dagnabbit!; and Scrambled McManus. In October 2011, an index of his stories and novels titled \\"Where's the One About the Bobcat?\\" was compiled by Lauren Ball, making it easy for readers to find their favorite stories.

The foremost among the childhood stories is his \\"mentor\\" Rancid Crabtree, a colorful woodsman who lives near Pat's childhood home, who doesn't bathe because he believes that soap and water would wash off his 'crust', which would let germs in. Other recurring characters are his childhood best friend, 'Crazy Eddie' Muldoon, his rough-and-tumble mutt appropriately named Strange, and his adulthood friends, the goofy and dim-witted Retch Sweeney, his straitlaced neighbor, Alphonse 'Al' Finley, and his rich friend Fenton Quagmire. Throughout the majority of the stories is a recurring theme of McManus's lifelong love of hunting and fishing‚Äîwhich is mostly an excuse to just enjoy the outdoors, often in good company. Most of his friends likewise enjoy hunting and fishing, even if they aren't particularly good at it. McManus, in his stories, has a certain amount of disgruntlement for people who take great pleasure in the minutiae of various sports (such as encyclopediac knowledge of firearms calibers and ballistics). He refers to firearms enthusiasts as 'gun nuts' and treats their excited sharing of the fine points of ballistic arcs and grain sizes as something to be endured to get on a good hunting trip. Some of the elements show up in his longer works, and are even worked into the plots. Bo Tully, the protagonist of the Bo Tully Mysteries, shares McManus' views about firearms. In the course of his job as Sheriff and his hobbies, Tully uses guns, knows about guns, but isn't particularly excited by them or even sentimental towards them. He is, however, aware that many people are. This even serves as plot point in one of the Bo Tully mysteries. References  External links  * *Patrick McManus Papers, 1952-2016.

There are four boarding houses: * Bedstone House - for junior girls * Wilson House - for senior girls * Rutter House - for junior boys * Pearson House - for senior boys Each is run by houseparents who are typically academic staff and their families. Its campus houses the notable country house that is Bedstone Court. Its founders include the parents of Sir Martin Rees.FT Magazine Inventory: Martin Rees On GCSE results, the College is the second best non-selective school in Shropshire and the sixth overall. Norman Origin St Mary's church dates back to Norman times and features an original Norman font, a timber framed bellcote and a shingled spire, and some of the houses, which include several thatched cottages, are more than 600 years old. Buildings St Mary's Church, the ancient parish church of Bedstone. Manor Farm house is an example of a timber-framed house and was partly stone-faced in 1775. Bedstone Court, now the home of Bedstone College, is a more flamboyant black-and-white mansion, built between 1882 and 1884, designed by Thomas Harris for Henry Ripley, MP and is a calendar house reputed to have 365 windows, 52 rooms (on the first two floors) twelve chimneys and seven external doors. The central hall has a magnificent 52 panelled stained-glass window depicting the months of the year, signs of the zodiac, birds associated with the month and the agricultural activity of the month. The building was heavily damaged by a fire in 1996 but was fully restored and continues to be the centrepiece of Bedstone College: the independent co-educational boarding and day school for pupils from 4 to 18. Amenities Until the 2000s there was a post office but now there is just a Royal Mail post box in the hamlet.dracos.co.uk Postboxes in SY7 Parish The civil parish covers a small area, with no other settlements than Bedstone itself. With a parish population of just 85 (in 2001), the parish council has now been merged with that of neighbouring Bucknell parish. In ecclesiastical terms, the church is linked with those of Hopton Castle and Clungunford.

The force, which comprises fifty one officers from Constable to Chief Police Officer is responsible for effective road policing of the Mersey Tunnels, Approach Roads and Exit Roads. It is privately funded by Merseytravel which is, in turn reports to the Liverpool City Region Combined Authority. Role and powers Mersey Tunnels Police officers hold the office of constable. Unlike most police services in England and Wales, the service is answerable to the Merseyside Passenger Transport ExecutiveMersey Tunnels rather than the Home Office. The executive also appoints the service's officers who are formally sworn in as police constables by a justice of the peace. As of 2010 the service consisted of around 55 officers across the various ranks. The service's jurisdiction consists of the tunnels themselves, marshaling areas, entrance/exit roads and all Mersey Tunnels premises. Officers execute their duties in accordance with The Mersey Tunnels Bylaws. In some cases, officers may assist with high-urgency motorway incidents in the surrounding area where other patrols are further away. The tunnels service have primary responsibility for these areas, meaning they enforce the Mersey Tunnels bylaws and like all other police services the various and relevant UK statute law/legislation although perhaps by the nature of the role primarily the Road Traffic Act. Mersey Tunnels Police officers are the first line responders to any incidents or emergencies within the tunnels or premises although certain incidents and enquiries of a serious nature may be dealt with by Merseyside Police in accordance with local agreements between the two services. Formed in January 1936 with two inspectors, four sergeants and 14 constables they undertook motorcycle patrols of the tunnels. The force grew to a maximum strength of 1 Chief Superintendent, 1 Chief Inspector, 5 Inspectors, 15 Sergeants and 60 Constables. As of January 2015, the establishment of the service consisted of 51 officers, divided amongst the following ranks: One chief officer, five inspectors, 10 sergeants and 35 constables. Vehicles The service uses a small range of vehicles. The newest models bought in 2010 being the Land Rover Discovery IV (3 litre) and .Ford S-Max Additionally, the service has some older Ford Galaxy and Land Rover Discovery II models which are also planned to be replaced in the second half of 2010 with Ford and Land Rover Freelander vehicles. As of 2020 the force have total of 8 Police vehicles 2 X Volvo V60 2 X Volvo XC70, which has 4 wheel drive capability. 2 X Land Rover Discovery IV, 1 X Mercedes Vito Cell Van, 1 X Ford S-Max Media coverage The Police service was heavily criticised by the Merseyside coroner for its handling of a pursuit in which two 14-year-old boys were killed in 2003 after crashing a stolen car into a roadblock set up by Mersey Tunnels officers. The coroner went so far as to recommend that either the policing of the tunnel should be altogether transferred to Merseyside Police, or tunnel officers should be trained to national policing standards.

It uses a pair of parallel rails and several slots perpendicular to these rails. The later Picatinny rail, developed by the US military, is a development of the key concepts of the Weaver system, and they are partly compatible. History The Weaver mount was developed by William Ralph Weaver (1905 ‚Äì 8 November 1975) at his telescopic sight company W.R. Weaver Co., which he founded in 1930. Previous systems included the Leupold/Redfield mounts. Compared to the Leupold mount, the Weaver rail is not as strong and cannot be adjusted for windage. W.R. Weaver Co. became Weaver Optics, and was a subsidiary of Meade Instruments Corporation from 2002 to 2008, when it was on-sold to become part of Alliant Techsystems's Security and Sporting division in Onalaska, Wisconsin. Features Older Weaver systems used two pieces mounted a distance apart from one another typically on the receiver of a rifle over the bolt opening where the cartridge would be inserted and/or ejected. However, alignment problems of the two piece system can put undue stress on a rifle scope and cause problems between the scope and rifle barrel parallels and bullet Point Of Impact (POI). Also the two piece system must be mounted to exacting tolerances to one another to ensure perfect alignment using a scope alignment device called Alignment Sleeves. The two piece type can also be problematic when some rifles will not allow for the two pieces to be mounted due to metal thickness of the receiver or other issues of receiver length that will not allow for proper distance to hold the scope. With the later one piece approach, the rail system remains consistent in alignment. The slots on a Weaver system are primarily used as a clearance of the locking screw that tightens the clamp to the rail. Some Weaver-type accessories have a bar that fits inside the machined slots on the rails while many others do not. Weaver rails have a slot width of 0.180 in (4.57 mm), but are not necessarily consistent in the spacing of slot centers. Failings The lack of a locking bar on many Weaver-type accessories also lends to another alignment issue, canting. Though this problem is not common it can be very problematic especially with scopes. Because scopes need to be mounted to a rifle in perfect parallel to the barrel and to ensure the cross hairs sit exactly where a bullet will go (POI), a small variation of even ¬º of one degree can cause massive problems at longer ranges. The locking bar holds the mount in a perfect 90 degree to the rail system where as a non-locking bar system can cant to the left or right. This canting (sometimes called jamming of surfaces) is caused by not matching the clamping surface perfectly to the rail. When tightened down, stress exerted on the base can cause the scope to be off from the POI by as much as several feet at 100‚Äì200 yards and gets progressively worse the farther out the range goes. Lower grade materials used in manufacturing of scope bases, inconsistent design tolerances from one manufacturer to another and other factors can cause twisting stress and cause the mount to move out of parallel with the rifle barrel. The locking bar system allows for even stress to be distributed and prevent canting of the scope mount. Another form of scope canting is caused by the rings themselves. Many Weaver-type mounts (including many Picatinny-type scope rings and even the Redfield Type) have either two or four screws on top of the scope ring that hold the scope in place. Both the Weaver and Picatinny clamp systems have a screw side and a clamp side. With the two-screw style, the ring usually aligns well but does not have the strength of the four screw system. Many times, when tightening the screws of the four screw type, the scope can twist in place, causing misalignment. Tightening the mounts in an ‚ÄúX‚Äù pattern and usually starting opposite of the outside clamp side; holding the scope slightly to the opposite side while tightening the screws usually allows for proper alignment of the scope to barrel parallel. Compatibility with Picatinny The military standard, MIL-STD-1913 \\"Picatinny rails\\" date from the mid-1990s and have very strict military standard dimensions and tolerances. The Picatinny rail has a similar profile to the Weaver, but the recoil groove width of the Picatinny rail is 0.206 in (5.23 mm) versus 0.180 in (4.57 mm) of the Weaver rail/mount , and by contrast with the Weaver, the spacing of the Picatinny recoil groove centers is consistent, at 0.394 in (10.01 mm). Many rail-grabber-mounted accessories can be used on either type of rail, and accessories designed for a Weaver system will generally fit Picatinny rails ‚Äì although not vice versa. because the Picatinny locking slot width is vs the .180 width of the Weaver, and the spacing of slot centers is .\\"Picatinny Rails, Weaver Rails, What‚Äôs The Difference?\\" Brownells Because of this, with devices that use only one locking slot, Weaver devices will fit on Picatinny rails, but Picatinny devices will not always fit on Weaver rails. Another difference is that Weaver rails are continuous with only two to four recoil grooves cut, while Picatinny rails have recoil grooves cut across the entire length of the rail at the above noted spacing (like a dotted line). This allows for more mounting position flexibility and also helps to neutralize expansion caused by barrel heating.

The analytic hierarchy process (AHP) is a structured technique for organizing and analyzing complex decisions, based on mathematics and psychology. It was developed by Thomas L. Saaty in the 1970s who partnered with Ernest Forman to develop Expert Choice in 1983, and has been extensively studied and refined since then. It represents an accurate approach for quantifying the weights of decision criteria. Individual experts‚Äô experiences are utilized to estimate the relative magnitudes of factors through pair-wise comparisons. Each of the respondents has to compare the relative importance between the two items under special designed questionnaire (note that while most of the surveys adopted the five point likert scale, AHP's questionnaire is 9 to 1 to 9, see Li et al. (2019) Li et. al. (2019) Ranking of Risks for Existing and New Building Works. International Sustainability 10: 2863. ) Uses and applications AHP has particular application in group decision making, and is used around the world in a wide variety of decision situations, in fields such as government, business, industry, healthcare, shipbuilding and education. Rather than prescribing a \\"correct\\" decision, the AHP helps decision makers find one that best suits their goal and their understanding of the problem. It provides a comprehensive and rational framework for structuring a decision problem, for representing and quantifying its elements, for relating those elements to overall goals, and for evaluating alternative solutions. Users of the AHP first decompose their decision problem into a hierarchy of more easily comprehended sub- problems, each of which can be analyzed independently. The elements of the hierarchy can relate to any aspect of the decision problem‚Äîtangible or intangible, carefully measured or roughly estimated, well or poorly understood‚Äîanything at all that applies to the decision at hand. Once the hierarchy is built, the decision makers systematically evaluate its various elements by comparing them to each other two at a time, with respect to their impact on an element above them in the hierarchy. In making the comparisons, the decision makers can use concrete data about the elements, but they typically use their judgments about the elements' relative meaning and importance. It is the essence of the AHP that human judgments, and not just the underlying information, can be used in performing the evaluations. The AHP converts these evaluations to numerical values that can be processed and compared over the entire range of the problem. A numerical weight or priority is derived for each element of the hierarchy, allowing diverse and often incommensurable elements to be compared to one another in a rational and consistent way. This capability distinguishes the AHP from other decision making techniques. In the final step of the process, numerical priorities are calculated for each of the decision alternatives. These numbers represent the alternatives' relative ability to achieve the decision goal, so they allow a straightforward consideration of the various courses of action. Several firms supply computer software to assist in using the process. While it can be used by individuals working on straightforward decisions, the Analytic Hierarchy Process (AHP) is most useful where teams of people are working on complex problems, especially those with high stakes, involving human perceptions and judgments, whose resolutions have long-term repercussions. It has unique advantages when important elements of the decision are difficult to quantify or compare, or where communication among team members is impeded by their different specializations, terminologies, or perspectives. Decision situations to which the AHP can be applied include: * Choice ‚Äì The selection of one alternative from a given set of alternatives, usually where there are multiple decision criteria involved. * Ranking ‚Äì Putting a set of alternatives in order from most to least desirable. * Prioritization ‚Äì Determining the relative merit of members of a set of alternatives, as opposed to selecting a single one or merely ranking them * Resource allocation ‚Äì Apportioning resources among a set of alternatives * Benchmarking ‚Äì Comparing the processes in one's own organization with those of other best-of-breed organizations * Quality management ‚Äì Dealing with the multidimensional aspects of quality and quality improvement * Conflict resolution ‚Äì Settling disputes between parties with apparently incompatible goals or positions The applications of AHP to complex decision situations have numbered in the thousands, and have produced extensive results in problems involving planning, resource allocation, priority setting, and selection among alternatives. Other areas have included forecasting, total quality management, business process reengineering, quality function deployment, and the balanced scorecard. Many AHP applications are never reported to the world at large, because they take place at high levels of large organizations where security and privacy considerations prohibit their disclosure. But some uses of AHP are discussed in the literature. Recently these have included: *Select a type of nuclear reactors (Politecnico di Milano) *Deciding how best to reduce the impact of global climate change (Fondazione Eni Enrico Mattei) *Quantifying the overall quality of software systems (Microsoft Corporation) *Selecting university faculty (Bloomsburg University of Pennsylvania) *Deciding where to locate offshore manufacturing plants (University of Cambridge) *Assessing risk in operating cross-country petroleum pipelines (American Society of Civil Engineers) *Deciding how best to manage U.S. watersheds (U.S. Department of Agriculture) *More Effectively Define and Evaluate SAP Implementation Approaches (SAP Experts) * Accelerated Bridge Construction Decision Making Tool to assist in determining the viability of accelerated bridge construction (ABC) over traditional construction methods and in selecting appropriate construction and contracting strategies on a case-by-case basis.Salem, O., Salman, B., & Ghorai, S. (2017). Accelerating construction of roadway bridges using alternative techniques and procurement methods. Transport, 33(2), 567-579. https://doi.org/10.3846/16484142.2017.1300942 AHP is sometimes used in designing highly specific procedures for particular situations, such as the rating of buildings by historic significance. It was recently applied to a project that uses video footage to assess the condition of highways in Virginia. Highway engineers first used it to determine the optimum scope of the project, then to justify its budget to lawmakers. Education and scholarly research Though using the analytic hierarchy process requires no specialized academic training, it is considered an important subject in many institutions of higher learning, including schools of engineering and graduate schools of business. It is a particularly important subject in the quality field, and is taught in many specialized courses including Six Sigma, Lean Six Sigma, and QFD. The value of the AHP is recognized in developed and developing countries around the world. China is an example‚Äînearly a hundred Chinese universities offer courses in AHP, and many doctoral students choose AHP as the subject of their research and dissertations. Over 900 papers have been published on the subject in China, and there is at least one Chinese scholarly journal devoted exclusively to AHP. The International Symposium on the Analytic Hierarchy Process (ISAHP) holds biennial meetings of academics and practitioners interested in the field. A wide range of topics are covered. Those in 2005 ranged from \\"Establishing Payment Standards for Surgical Specialists\\", to \\"Strategic Technology Roadmapping\\", to \\"Infrastructure Reconstruction in Devastated Countries\\". At the 2007 meeting in Valpara√≠so, Chile, over 90 papers were presented from 19 countries, including the US, Germany, Japan, Chile, Malaysia, and Nepal. A similar number of papers were presented at the 2009 symposium in Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania, when 28 countries were represented. Subjects of the papers included Economic Stabilization in Latvia, Portfolio Selection in the Banking Sector, Wildfire Management to Help Mitigate Global Warming, and Rural Microprojects in Nepal. Use A typical device for entering judgments in an AHP group decision making sessionAs can be seen in the material that follows, using the AHP involves the mathematical synthesis of numerous judgments about the decision problem at hand. It is not uncommon for these judgments to number in the dozens or even the hundreds. While the math can be done by hand or with a calculator, it is far more common to use one of several computerized methods for entering and synthesizing the judgments. The simplest of these involve standard spreadsheet software, while the most complex use custom software, often augmented by special devices for acquiring the judgments of decision makers gathered in a meeting room. The procedure for using the AHP can be summarized as: #Model the problem as a hierarchy containing the decision goal, the alternatives for reaching it, and the criteria for evaluating the alternatives. #Establish priorities among the elements of the hierarchy by making a series of judgments based on pairwise comparisons of the elements. For example, when comparing potential purchases of commercial real estate, the investors might say they prefer location over price and price over timing. #Synthesize these judgments to yield a set of overall priorities for the hierarchy. This would combine the investors' judgments about location, price and timing for properties A, B, C, and D into overall priorities for each property. #Check the consistency of the judgments. #Come to a final decision based on the results of this process. These steps are more fully described below. =Model the problem as a hierarchy= The first step in the analytic hierarchy process is to model the problem as a hierarchy. In doing this, participants explore the aspects of the problem at levels from general to detailed, then express it in the multileveled way that the AHP requires. As they work to build the hierarchy, they increase their understanding of the problem, of its context, and of each other's thoughts and feelings about both. (This book is the primary source for the sections in which it is cited.) Hierarchies defined A hierarchy is a stratified system of ranking and organizing people, things, ideas, etc., where each element of the system, except for the top one, is subordinate to one or more other elements. Though the concept of hierarchy is easily grasped intuitively, it can also be described mathematically. Diagrams of hierarchies are often shaped roughly like pyramids, but other than having a single element at the top, there is nothing necessarily pyramid-shaped about a hierarchy. Human organizations are often structured as hierarchies, where the hierarchical system is used for assigning responsibilities, exercising leadership, and facilitating communication. Familiar hierarchies of \\"things\\" include a desktop computer's tower unit at the \\"top\\", with its subordinate monitor, keyboard, and mouse \\"below.\\" In the world of ideas, we use hierarchies to help us acquire detailed knowledge of complex reality: we structure the reality into its constituent parts, and these in turn into their own constituent parts, proceeding down the hierarchy as many levels as we care to. At each step, we focus on understanding a single component of the whole, temporarily disregarding the other components at this and all other levels. As we go through this process, we increase our global understanding of whatever complex reality we are studying. Think of the hierarchy that medical students use while learning anatomy‚Äîthey separately consider the musculoskeletal system (including parts and subparts like the hand and its constituent muscles and bones), the circulatory system (and its many levels and branches), the nervous system (and its numerous components and subsystems), etc., until they've covered all the systems and the important subdivisions of each. Advanced students continue the subdivision all the way to the level of the cell or molecule. In the end, the students understand the \\"big picture\\" and a considerable number of its details. Not only that, but they understand the relation of the individual parts to the whole. By working hierarchically, they've gained a comprehensive understanding of anatomy. Similarly, when we approach a complex decision problem, we can use a hierarchy to integrate large amounts of information into our understanding of the situation. As we build this information structure, we form a better and better picture of the problem as a whole. Hierarchies in the AHP An AHP hierarchy is a structured means of modeling the decision at hand. It consists of an overall goal, a group of options or alternatives for reaching the goal, and a group of factors or criteria that relate the alternatives to the goal. The criteria can be further broken down into subcriteria, sub-subcriteria, and so on, in as many levels as the problem requires. A criterion may not apply uniformly, but may have graded differences like a little sweetness is enjoyable but too much sweetness can be harmful. In that case the criterion is divided into subcriteria indicating different intensities of the criterion, like: little, medium, high and these intensities are prioritized through comparisons under the parent criterion, sweetness. Published descriptions of AHP applications often include diagrams and descriptions of their hierarchies; some simple ones are shown throughout this article. More complex AHP hierarchies have been collected and reprinted in at least one book. 496 pages, spiral bound. Each entry includes a description and diagram of an AHP model; the models are grouped in categories: educational, government/public policy, government public/strategy, health military, non-profit, personal, planning, political, etc. More complex hierarchies can be found in a special talk page for this article. The design of any AHP hierarchy will depend not only on the nature of the problem at hand, but also on the knowledge, judgments, values, opinions, needs, wants, etc. of the participants in the decision-making process. Constructing a hierarchy typically involves significant discussion, research, and discovery by those involved. Even after its initial construction, it can be changed to accommodate newly-thought-of criteria or criteria not originally considered to be important; alternatives can also be added, deleted, or changed. To better understand AHP hierarchies, consider a decision problem with a goal to be reached, three alternative ways of reaching the goal, and four criteria against which the alternatives need to be measured. Such a hierarchy can be visualized as a diagram like the one immediately below, with the goal at the top, the three alternatives at the bottom, and the four criteria in between. There are useful terms for describing the parts of such diagrams: Each box is called a node. A node that is connected to one or more nodes in a level below it is called a parent node. The nodes to which it is so connected are called its children. Applying these definitions to the diagram below, the goal is the parent of the four criteria, and the four criteria are children of the goal. Each criterion is a parent of the three Alternatives. Note that there are only three Alternatives, but in the diagram, each of them is repeated under each of its parents. A simple AHP hierarchy. There are three Alternatives for reaching the Goal, and four Criteria to be used in deciding among them. To reduce the size of the drawing required, it is common to represent AHP hierarchies as shown in the diagram below, with only one node for each alternative, and with multiple lines connecting the alternatives and the criteria that apply to them. To avoid clutter, these lines are sometimes omitted or reduced in number. Regardless of any such simplifications in the diagram, in the actual hierarchy each criterion is individually connected to the alternatives. The lines may be thought of as being directed downward from the parent in one level to its children in the level below. AHP hierarchy for choosing a leader. There is one goal, three candidates and four criteria for choosing among them. =Evaluate the hierarchy= Once the hierarchy has been constructed, the participants analyze it through a series of pairwise comparisons that derive numerical scales of measurement for the nodes. The criteria are pairwise compared against the goal for importance. The alternatives are pairwise compared against each of the criteria for preference. The comparisons are processed mathematically, and priorities are derived for each node. Consider the \\"Choose a Leader\\" example above. An important task of the decision makers is to determine the weight to be given each criterion in making the choice of a leader. Another important task is to determine the weight to be given to each candidate with regard to each of the criteria. The AHP not only lets them do that, but it lets them put a meaningful and objective numerical value on each of the four criteria. =Establish priorities= This section explains priorities, shows how they are established, and provides a simple example. Priorities defined and explained Priorities are numbers associated with the nodes of an AHP hierarchy. They represent the relative weights of the nodes in any group. Like probabilities, priorities are absolute numbers between zero and one, without units or dimensions. A node with priority .200 has twice the weight in reaching the goal as one with priority .100, ten times the weight of one with priority .020, and so forth. Depending on the problem at hand, \\"weight\\" can refer to importance, or preference, or likelihood, or whatever factor is being considered by the decision makers. Priorities are distributed over a hierarchy according to its architecture, and their values depend on the information entered by users of the process. Priorities of the Goal, the Criteria, and the Alternatives are intimately related, but need to be considered separately. By definition, the priority of the Goal is 1.000. The priorities of the alternatives always add up to 1.000. Things can become complicated with multiple levels of Criteria, but if there is only one level, their priorities also add to 1.000. All this is illustrated by the priorities in the example below. Simple AHP hierarchy with associated default priorities. Observe that the priorities on each level of the example‚Äîthe goal, the criteria, and the alternatives‚Äîall add up to 1.000. The priorities shown are those that exist before any information has been entered about weights of the criteria or alternatives, so the priorities within each level are all equal. They are called the hierarchy's default priorities. If a fifth Criterion were added to this hierarchy, the default priority for each Criterion would be .200. If there were only two Alternatives, each would have a default priority of .500. Two additional concepts apply when a hierarchy has more than one level of criteria: local priorities and global priorities. Consider the hierarchy shown below, which has several Subcriteria under each Criterion. A more complex AHP hierarchy, with local and global default priorities. In the interest of clarity, the decision alternatives do not appear in the diagram. The local priorities, shown in gray, represent the relative weights of the nodes within a group of siblings with respect to their parent. The local priorities of each group of Criteria and their sibling Subcriteria add up to 1.000. The global priorities, shown in black, are obtained by multiplying the local priorities of the siblings by their parent's global priority. The global priorities for all the subcriteria in the level add up to 1.000. The rule is this: Within a hierarchy, the global priorities of child nodes always add up to the global priority of their parent. Within a group of children, the local priorities add up to 1.000. So far, we have looked only at default priorities. As the Analytical Hierarchy Process moves forward, the priorities will change from their default values as the decision makers input information about the importance of the various nodes. They do this by making a series of pairwise comparisons. Practical examples Experienced practitioners know that the best way to understand the AHP is to work through cases and examples. Two detailed case studies, specifically designed as in-depth teaching examples, are provided as appendices to this article: * Simple step-by-step example with four Criteria and three Alternatives: Choosing a leader for an organization. * More complex step-by-step example with ten Criteria/Subcriteria and six Alternatives: Buying a family car and Machinery Selection Example. Some of the books on AHP contain practical examples of its use, though they are not typically intended to be step-by-step learning aids. One of them contains a handful of expanded examples, plus about 400 AHP hierarchies briefly described and illustrated with figures. Many examples are discussed, mostly for professional audiences, in papers published by the International Symposium on the Analytic Hierarchy Process. Criticisms The AHP is included in most operations research and management science textbooks, and is taught in numerous universities; it is used extensively in organizations that have carefully investigated its theoretical underpinnings. While the general consensus is that it is both technically valid and practically useful, the method does have its critics. In the early 1990s a series of debates between critics and proponents of AHP was published in Management ScienceDyer, J. S. (1990): Remarks on the Analytic Hierarchy Process.

They are the publishers of Management Science, one of the journals in which the original critical debates were published. Their Impact Prize is awarded every two years to recognize contributions that have had a broad impact on the fields of operations research and the management sciences; emphasis is placed on the breadth of the impact of an idea or body of research. In 2008, Thomas L. Saaty received the INFORMS Impact Prize for his development of the Analytic Hierarchy Process. Occasional criticisms still appear. A 1997 paper examined possible flaws in the verbal (vs. numerical) scale often used in AHP pairwise comparisons.Mari A. P√∂yh√∂nen, Raimo P. H√§m√§l√§inen, Ahti A. Salo \\"An Experiment on the Numerical Modelling of Verbal Ratio Statements\\" Journal of Multi-Criteria Decision Analysis, vol 6, no 1, ppg 1-10, 1997 Another from the same year claimed that innocuous changes to the AHP model can introduce order where no order exists.Stan Schenkerman \\"Inducement of nonexistent order by the analytic hierarchy process\\", Decision Sciences, Spring 1997 A 2006 paper found that the addition of criteria for which all alternatives perform equally can alter the priorities of alternatives.Perez et al. \\"Another Potential Shortcoming of AHP\\" TOP: An Official Journal of the Spanish Society of Statistics and Operations Research, Volume 14, Number 1 / June, 2006, Springer Berlin/Heidelberg Rank reversal Decision making involves ranking alternatives in terms of criteria or attributes of those alternatives. It is an axiom of some decision theories that when new alternatives are added to a decision problem, the ranking of the old alternatives must not change ‚Äî that \\"rank reversal\\" must not occur. There are two schools of thought about rank reversal. One maintains that new alternatives that introduce no additional attributes should not cause rank reversal under any circumstances. The other maintains that there are some situations in which rank reversal can reasonably be expected. The original formulation of AHP allowed rank reversals. In 1993, FormanForman, Ernest H., \\"Ideal and Distributed Synthesis Modes for the Analytic Hierarchy Process\\" presented at the International Federation of Operations Research, Lisbon Portugal, July 1993. introduced a second AHP synthesis mode, called the ideal synthesis mode, to address choice situations in which the addition or removal of an 'irrelevant' alternative should not and will not cause a change in the ranks of existing alternatives. The current version of the AHP can accommodate both these schools‚Äîits ideal mode preserves rank, while its distributive mode allows the ranks to change. Either mode is selected according to the problem at hand. Rank reversal and AHP are extensively discussed in a 2001 paper in Operations Research, as well as a chapter entitled Rank Preservation and Reversal, in the current basic book on AHP. The latter presents published examples of rank reversal due to adding copies and near copies of an alternative, due to intransitivity of decision rules, due to adding phantom and decoy alternatives, and due to the switching phenomenon in utility functions. It also discusses the Distributive and Ideal Modes of AHP. A new form of rank reversal of AHP was found in 2014 in which AHP produces rank order reversal when eliminating irrelevant data, this is data that do not differentiate alternatives. There are different types of rank reversals. Also, other methods besides the AHP may exhibit such rank reversals. More discussion on rank reversals with the AHP and other MCDM methods is provided in the rank reversals in decision-making page. Non-monotonicity of some weight extraction methods Within a comparison matrix one may replace a judgement with a less favorable judgment and then check to see if the indication of the new priority becomes less favorable then the original priority. In the context of tournament matrices, it has been proven by Oskar PerronLandau, E. (1914). √úber Preisverteilung bei Spielturnieren. Zeitschrift f√ºr Mathematik und Physik, 63 band (1914), p. 192 that the principal right eigenvector method is not monotonic. This behaviour can also be demonstrated for reciprocal n x n matrices, where n > 3. Alternative approaches are discussed elsewhere.Zermelo, E. (1928).

They participate in 3 metabolic pathways: bile acid biosynthesis, androgen and estrogen metabolism. There are three isoenzymes of 5Œ±-reductase, SRD5A1, SRD5A2, and SRD5A3, which vary in different tissues with age. 5Œ±-Reductases catalyze the following chemical reaction: :a 3-oxo-5Œ±-steroid + acceptor a 3-oxo-Œî4-steroid + reduced acceptor Thus, the two substrates of these enzymes are a 3-oxo-5Œ±-steroid and acceptor, whereas its two products are 3-oxo-Œî4-steroid and a reduced acceptor. For example: :dihydrotestosterone + NADP+ \\\\rightleftharpoons testosterone + NADPH + H+ Production and activity The enzyme is produced in many tissues in both males and females, in the reproductive tract, testes and ovaries, skin, seminal vesicles, prostate, epididymis and many organs, including the Nervous System. There are three isoenzymes of 5Œ±-reductase: steroid 5Œ±-reductase 1, 2, and 3 (SRD5A1, SRD5A2 and SRD5A3). 5Œ±-Reductases act on 3-oxo (3-keto), Œî4,5 C19/C21 steroids as its substrates. ‚Äú3-keto‚Äù refers to the double bond of the third carbon to oxygen. Carbons 4 and 5 also have a double bond, represented by 'Œî4,5'. The reaction involves a stereospecific and permanent break of the Œî4,5 with the help of NADPH as a cofactor. A hydride anion (H‚àí) is also placed on the Œ± face at the fifth carbon, and a proton on the Œ≤ face at carbon 4. Distribution with age 5Œ±-R1 is expressed in fetal scalp and nongenital skin of the back, anywhere from 5 to 50 times less than in the adult. 5Œ±-R2 is expressed in fetal prostates similar to adults. 5Œ±-R1 is expressed mainly in the epithelium and 5Œ±-R2 the stroma of the fetal prostate. Scientists looked for 5Œ±-R2 expression in fetal liver, adrenal, testis, ovary, brain, scalp, chest, and genital skin, using immunoblotting, and were only able to find it in genital skin. After birth, the 5Œ±-R1 is expressed in more locations, including the liver, skin, scalp and prostate. 5Œ±-R2 is expressed in prostate, seminal vesicles, epididymis, liver, and to a lesser extent the scalp and skin. Hepatic expression of both 5Œ±-R1 and 2 is immediate, but disappears in the skin and scalp at month 18. Then, at puberty, only 5Œ±-R1 is reexpressed in the skin and scalp. 5Œ±-R1 and 5Œ±-R2 appear to be expressed in the prostate in male fetuses and throughout postnatal life. In adulthood, 5Œ±-R1-3 is ubiquitously expressed. 5Œ±-R1 and 5Œ±-R2 are also expressed, although to different degrees in liver, genital and nongenital skin, prostate, epididymis, seminal vesicle, testis, ovary, uterus, kidney, exocrine pancreas, and the brain. Substrates Specific substrates include testosterone, progesterone, androstenedione, epitestosterone, cortisol, aldosterone, and deoxycorticosterone. Outside of dihydrotestosterone, much of the physiological role of 5Œ±-reduced steroids is unknown. Beyond reducing testosterone to dihydrotestosterone, 5alpha-reductase enzyme isoforms I and II reduce progesterone to dihydroprogesterone (DHP) and deoxycorticosterone to dihydrodeoxycorticosterone (DHDOC). In vitro and animal models suggest subsequent 3alpha-reduction of DHT, DHP and DHDOC lead to steroid metabolites with effects on cerebral function achieved by enhancing GABAergic inhibition. These neuroactive steroid derivatives enhance GABA via allosteric modulation at GABA(A) receptors and have anticonvulsant, antidepressant and anxiolytic effects, and also alter sexual and alcohol related behavior. 5Œ±-dihydrocortisol is present in the aqueous humor of the eye, is synthesized in the lens, and might help make the aqueous humor itself. Allopregnanolone and THDOC are neurosteroids, with the latter having effects on the susceptibility of animals to seizures. In socially isolated mice, 5Œ±-R1 is specifically down-regulated in glutamatergic pyramidal neurons that converge on the amygdala from cortical and hippocampal regions. This down-regulation may account for the appearance of behavioral disorders such as anxiety, aggression, and cognitive dysfunction. 5Œ±-dihydroaldosterone is a potent antinatriuretic agent, although different from aldosterone. Its formation in the kidney is enhanced by restriction of dietary salt, suggesting it may help retain sodium as follows: ::: {Substrate} + {NADPH} + H+ -> {5\\\\alpha- substrate} + NADP+ 5Œ±-DHP is a major hormone in circulation of normal cycling and pregnant women. =Testosterone= 5Œ±-Reductase is most known for converting testosterone, the male sex hormone, into the more potent dihydrotestosterone: Image:Testosteron.svgTestosterone. Image:Androstanolone.svgDihydrotestosterone The major difference is the Œî4,5 double-bond on the A (leftmost) ring. The other differences between the diagrams are unrelated to structure. =List of conversions= The following reactions are known to be catalyzed by 5Œ±-reductase: * Cholestenone ‚Üí 5Œ±-Cholestanone * Progesterone ‚Üí 5Œ±-Dihydroprogesterone * 3Œ±-Dihydroprogesterone ‚Üí Allopregnanolone * 3Œ≤-Dihydroprogesterone ‚Üí Isopregnanolone * Deoxycorticosterone ‚Üí 5Œ±-Dihydrodeoxycorticosterone * Corticosterone ‚Üí 5Œ±-Dihydrocorticosterone * Cortisol ‚Üí 5Œ±-Dihydrocortisol * Aldosterone ‚Üí 5Œ±-Dihydroaldosterone * Androstenedione ‚Üí 5Œ±-Androstanedione * Testosterone ‚Üí 5Œ±-Dihydrotestosterone * Nandrolone ‚Üí 5Œ±-Dihydronandrolone Inhibition The mechanism of 5Œ± reductase inhibition is complex, but involves the binding of NADPH to the enzyme followed by the substrate. 5Œ±-reductase inhibitor drugs are used in benign prostatic hyperplasia, prostate cancer, pattern hair loss (androgenetic alopecia), and hormone replacement therapy for transgender women. Inhibition of the enzyme can be classified into two categories: steroidal, which are irreversible, and nonsteroidal. There are more steroidal inhibitors, with examples including finasteride (MK-906), dutasteride (GG745), 4-MA, turosteride, MK-386, MK-434, and MK-963. Researchers have pursued synthesis of nonsteroidals to inhibit 5Œ±-reductase due to the undesired side effects of steroidals. The most potent and selective inhibitors of 5Œ±-R1 are found in this class, and include benzoquinolones, nonsteroidal aryl acids, butanoic acid derivatives, and more recognizably, polyunsaturated fatty acids (especially linolenic acid), zinc, and green tea. Riboflavin was also identified as a 5Œ±-reductase inhibitor . Additionally, it has been claimed that alfatradiol works through this mechanism of activity (5Œ±-reductase), as well as the Ganoderic acids in lingzhi mushroom, and the Saw Palmetto. Inhibition of 5Œ±-reductase results in decreased conversion of testosterone to DHT, leading to increased testosterone and estradiol. Other enzymes compensate to a degree for the absent conversion, specifically with local expression at the skin of reductive 17Œ≤-hydroxysteroid dehydrogenase, oxidative 3Œ±-hydroxysteroid dehydrogenase, and 3Œ≤-hydroxysteroid dehydrogenase enzymes. Gynecomastia, erectile dysfunction, impaired cognitive function, fatigue, hypoglycemia, impaired liver function, constipation, and depression, are only a few of the possible side-effects of 5Œ±-reductase inhibition. Long term side effects, that continued even after discontinuation of the drug have been reported. =Finasteride= Finasteride inhibits two 5Œ±-reductase isoenzymes (II and III), while dutasteride inhibits all three. Finasteride potently inhibits 5Œ±-R2 at a mean inhibitory concentration IC50 of 69 nM, but is less effective with 5Œ±-R1 till an IC50 of 360 nM. Finasteride decreases mean serum level of DHT by 71% after 6 months, and was shown in vitro to inhibit 5Œ±-R3 at a similar potency to 5Œ±-R2 in transfected cell lines. =Dutasteride= Dutasteride inhibits 5Œ±-reductase isoenzymes type 1 and 2 better than finasteride, leading to a more complete reduction in DHT at 24 weeks (94.7% versus 70.8%). It also reduces intraprostatic DHT 97% in men with prostate cancer at 5 mg/day over three months. A second study with 3.5 mg/day for 4 months decreased intraprostatic DHT even further by 99%. The suppression of DHT in vivo, and the report that dutasteride inhibits 5Œ±-R3 in vitro suggest that dutasteride may be a triple 5Œ± reductase inhibitor. Congenital deficiencies =5Œ±-Reductase 1= 5Œ±-Reductase type 1 inactivated male mice have reduced bone mass and forelimb muscle grip strength, which has been proposed to be due to lack of 5Œ±-reductase type 1 expression in bone and muscle. In 5 alpha reductase type 2 deficient males, the type 1 isoenzyme is thought to be responsible for their virilization at puberty. =5Œ±-Reductase 2= The second isoenzyme of 5Œ± reductase is deficient in the classic intersex condition (pseudovaginal perineoscrotal hypospadias), or 5Œ±-reductase deficiency. It was first discovered in indigenous cultures of Papua, New Guinea, where children were born with feminine genitalia in the absence of endogenous DHT during pregnancy, but with the surge of testosterone during adolescence, changed to males at puberty. Because of this change at puberty, the condition is also sometimes called \\"guevedoche.\\" There is a range of external appearance that has been described of external genitalia at birth, with varying degrees of virilization. =5Œ±-Reductase 3= When small interfering RNA is used to knock down the expression of 5Œ±-R3 isozyme in cell lines, there is decreased cell growth, viability, and a decrease in DHT/T ratios. It has also shown the ability to reduce testosterone, androstenedione, and progesterone in androgen stimulated prostate cell lines by adenovirus vectors. Congenital deficiency of 5Œ±-R3 at the gene SRD53A has been linked to a rare, autosomal recessive condition in which patients are born with severe intellectual dysfunction and cerebellar and ocular defects. The presumed deficiency is reduction of the terminal bond of polyprenol to dolichol, an important step in N-glycosylation of proteins, which in turn is important for proper folding of asparagine residues on nascent protein in the endoplasmic reticulum. Nomenclature This enzyme belongs to the family of oxidoreductases, to be specific, those acting on the CH-CH group of donor with other acceptors.

Using dressed up and coifed thumbs as puppets, Oedekerk created a parody of Star Wars, with characters like Loke Groundrunner, Princess Bunhead, Oobeedoob Benubi, Hand Duet, Crunchaka, Beeboobeep, Prissypeo, Black Helmet Man and Gabba the Butt. Thumb Wars debuted on American television May 18, 1999, on UPN. It had its cable premiere on Cartoon Network on October 2, 2008 to promote the 2008 Clone Wars series that premiered the next day. The TV version provided a trimmed down version of the film. It was also re-released in 2002 alongside Thumbtanic as the Thumb Wars/Thumbtanic Thumb Double Feature on VHS and DVD. In 2005, the filmettes were again released together as a UMD Video on the PlayStation Portable system.  Storyline  The 29-minute film opens with a parody of Star Wars' \\"A long time ago...\\" phrase: \\"If there were thumbs in space and they got mad at each other there would be... THUMB WARS.\\" The film then cuts to rolling text flying into the distance, as in Star Wars: \\"It is a time of great unrest in the Universe. Using the nail side of the power of the Thumb, the Evil Thumbpire has taken a stronghold in the Sacul region of the Egroeg sector. The Thumbellion Resistance Fighters have retreated to a hidden base. The Thumbpire is constructing a big dangerous weapon thing with enough fire power to blow stuff up. If the Thumbellion can destroy the big dangerous weapon thing, they will live and the good side of the thumb will reign. If they don't there can be no sequels. No sequels means no merchandising, no fan clubs, no freaky guys at conventions that have way too much free time and no clear desire to date girls. Victory is imperative!\\" Opening scenes depict Black Helmet Man capturing Princess Bunhead and killing Thumbellion soldiers. On the surface of the planet below, Loke Groundrunner whines to his aunt and uncle about wanting to be of use to someone. His uncle consoles him. \\"Well you're plenty useful here Loke. The harvest is soon and you'll be getting help! I bought a couple of digits today from the freaky little hooded creatures. The big one is sort of effeminate and annoying, and I think the little one has an amputee inside!\\" Loke runs off in a huff and meets up with the man with the silliest name in the galaxy: Oobedoob Scoobi-Doobi Benubi. At Oobedoob's place, they view a hologram of Princess Bunhead. She informs them that Black Helmet Man is building a \\"big, dangerous weapon thing\\" and that she needs their help. Loke and Oobedoob look up her holographic dress. After they viewed the message, they came back to Loke's house to find that his uncle Soondead and aunt Gonnabiteit have been 'clipped' by Black Helmet Man's troops. Loke determines to go and fight this evil menace. At the Cantina, Loke and Oobedoob meet up with Crunchy and Hand Duet. Hand tells them, \\"A one armed man killed my wife Sabrina, a working girl. Now I'm a fugitive and in clear and present danger. I should be presumed innocent but they're playing patriot games with me. Raiders. Regarding Henry. Blade Runner. Air Force One...\\" Loke and Oobedoob pay Hand and Crunchy in \\"girly giggles\\" at Hand's request, to save his skin from Gabba the Butt. The group boards Hand's ship Hand's Hand and set off to save Princess Bunhead and the galaxy. They are caught in a tractor beam outside of the Thumb Star which can spin planets. Once on the space station, Oobedoob and Black Helmet Man engage in a final duel, which Oobedoob is tricked into losing. Princess Bunhead appears and says, \\"I escaped somehow. Let's go.\\" The team, minus Oobedoob, flee. However, Oobedoob's voice can be heard in Loke's head saying that he is still there \\"in spirit.\\" Loke mentions that he considers this to be \\"kinda creepy\\". The group hides in an asteroid where Loke meets Master Puppet. Master Puppet agrees to train Loke in the ways of The Thumb. After a training session, which Loke ends up failing miserably, Master Puppet (deeply humored by Loke's bumbling) dubs him a Thumb Master. The group travels to the Thumbellion base to regroup for the final attack on the Thumb Star. They learn that there is a button on the station designed to blow the entire thing up, much to the confusion of Princess Bunhead. The Thumbellion fleet launches an attack on the station. This sets the stage for the final confrontation between Loke Groundrunner and Black Helmet Man atop Loke's Finger-wing fighter. It is then that Black Helmet Man reveals: \\"Loke, I am your... mother!\\" and throws his cape back to reveal a pink dress. Hand's Hand appears and knocks Black Helmet Man off into space. As he floats into space, Black Helmet Man calls out to Loke by yelling, \\"Just wait till your father gets home!\\" When Loke proudly proclaims that he will use the Power of the Thumb to hit the destruct button, Oobedoob's voice is heard saying to use the ship's targeting system, as \\"that's what it's there for.\\" Loke fires a missile which hits the button and the giant thumb is destroyed. The last scene shows the cast at a Chili Cookoff, along with Master Puppet (visibly controlled by a puppeteer) and the ghost of Oobedoob. The film ends with a voiceover from Oobedoob: \\"The Thumb will be with you...always.\\"  Production  The production for Thumb Wars started in 1997 with Steve Oedekerk, Paul Marshal, Tom Koranda, Mark DeCarlo and Jim Jackman. In 1998, the production for Thumb Wars developed more seriously into filming. The production started filming in Los Angeles, California in the California suburbs.  Running gags  Throughout the movie different characters will ask Loke to touch tongues. First Oobedoob, requiring this to 'seal the training's beginning' and 'make it all official'. Also, Master Puppet asks so to train Loke in the ways of the Thumb. As a running gag between all of the Thumbs! featurettes, a one-eyed thumb appears in each one, In this case as the bartender at the cantina.  Releases  Thumb Wars was first released on VHS, and then again with additional features, including character bios, commentary, and a 'Gabba the Butt' interview, on DVD. It is also available as part of the Thumb Wars/Thumbtanic Double Feature on DVD and UMD for the PlayStation Portable, released by O Entertainment and Image Entertainment.

The folk record label Topic Records was based at 48‚Äì50 Stroud Green Road and many folk LPs were recorded there. The label has since moved to Uppingham in Rutland. =Library= In the east of the neighbourhood, next to Harringay railway station is the Stroud Green & Harringay Library. Transport Stroud Green Road runs north west from the transport hub of Finsbury Park station, and stops just 150 yards south east of Crouch Hill railway station on the Gospel Oak to Barking line. On the eastern border of Stroud Green is Harringay railway station on the Great Northern Line. London bus routes W3, W7, and 210 run the length of Stroud Green Road, terminating at Finsbury Park. The low railway bridge at Finsbury Park prevents bus routes running directly from areas north of Finsbury Park such as Stroud Green Road directly into central London.

He now works at the synthetic biology company Ginkgo Bioworks, which he cofounded in 2008.  Work in electrical engineering and computer science  Tom Knight arrived at MIT when he was fourteen. Even though he only started his undergraduate studies at the regular age of 18, he took classes in computer programming and organic chemistry during high school because he lived close to the university.\\"Adam Bluestein (2012) Tom Knight, Godfather Of Synthetic Biology, On How To Learn Something New\\", fastcompany.com He built early hardware such as ARPANET interfaces for host #6 on the network, some of the first bitmapped displays, the ITS time sharing system, Lisp machines (he was also instrumental in releasing a version of the operating system for the Lisp machine under a BSD license), the Connection Machine, and parallel symbolic processing computer systems. In 1967 Knight wrote the original kernel for the ITS operating system, as well as the combination of command processor and debugger that was used as its top-level user interface. ITS was the dominant operating system for first Project MAC and later the MIT Artificial Intelligence Laboratory and MIT Laboratory for Computer Science. ITS ran on PDP-6 and, later, PDP-10 computers. In 1968, Knight designed and supervised the construction of the first PDP-10 ARPANET interfaces with Bob Metcalfe. Knight developed a system to use standard television sets as a terminal interface to the PDP-10. In 1972, Knight designed one of the first semiconductor memory-based bitmap displays. This was later commercialized and led directly to the development of the Bedford Computer Systems newspaper layout system and influenced many of the bitmapped display devices available today. That same year, along with Jeff Rubin, Knight designed and implemented a network file system that provided the first transparent remote file access over the ARPANET. In 1974, Knight designed and implemented the prototype version of the MIT Lisp Machine processor, with the production version following in 1976. The Lisp Machine was a microprogrammed machine, tuned for high-performance emulation of other instruction sets. The design of the Lisp Machine was directly implemented by both Symbolics and LMI and was the basis of all of their computers. Texas Instruments implemented surface mount and single-chip versions of the architecture in 1983 and 1987, respectively. Knight collaborated with Jack Holloway in designing and implementing the Chaosnet, a re-engineered version of the Xerox 3 Mbit/s Ethernet. In 1975 this network became the first local area network on MIT's campus. Chaosnet's innovation of a preamble bit string for packets was eventually incorporated into the 10 Mbit/s Ethernet standard. In 1980, Knight participated in the development of the Connection Machine architecture and its original implementation. Other notable and diverse accomplishments during the 1980s included the creation of the first silicon retina in 1981, the creation of a single-chip optical mouse, the design of the Cross-Omega interconnection network architecture, and the design of the Transit multiprocessor interconnection architecture. During the early 1990s, Knight was involved in the formation of Permabit and of Exa Corporation and the architecture of the latter's initial version of its FX/1 lattice gas parallel fluid flow computer. Advances included using over-relaxation techniques to make 10x algorithmic improvements in lattice gas computations, landmark CFD accuracies, and correction of misconceptions about the origin of fluid turbulence in simple two-dimensional flow situations. Within the Laboratory for Computer Science, he led the Abacus SIMD project, worked on VLSI micro displays, and made advances in the field of adiabatic (reversible) computing.  Work in synthetic biology  It was also during this period that Knight's interests in biological systems began. Inspired in part by the work of Harold J. Morowitz, a Yale physicist and biologist, Knight studied biochemistry, genetics, and cellular biology, and set up a biology lab within the MIT AI Laboratory. In this lab he created the concept of the BioBrick plasmid DNA part and began creating a library of BioBricks that could be used to simplify the genetic engineering of Escherichia coli cells. Today, BioBricks form the basis of the enormous annual iGEM (International Genetically Engineered Machine) competition and Knight is sometimes referred to as the godfather of synthetic biology. Knight co-founded Ginkgo Bioworks, a synthetic biology company.

Early life He was born in West Chester, Pennsylvania, on February 22, 1888, on Washington's birthday, to Harriet Pippin; his father's identity is unknown. He grew up in and around Goshen, New York, but would return to West Chester in adulthood. In Goshen, he attended segregated schools until he was 15, when he went to work to support his ailing mother.Forgey, 1977, p. 74. As a boy, Horace responded to an art supply company's advertising contest and won his first set of crayons and a box of watercolors. As a youngster, Pippin made drawings of racehorses and jockeys from Goshen's celebrated racetrack. Prior to his service in World War I, Pippin worked as a hotel porter, a furniture packer, and an iron moulder. He was a member of St. John's African Union Methodist Protestant Church. In 1920, Pippin married Jennie Fetherstone Wade Giles, who had been widowed twice and had a six-year-old-son. World War I In World War I, Pippin served in K Company, the 3rd Battalion of the 369th infantry regiment, known for their bravery in battle as the famous Harlem Hellfighters. The predominately Black unit faced enormous racism, especially before they were transferred to the command of the French Army. They were the longest serving U.S. regiment on the war's frontlines, holding their ground against enemy fire almost continuously from mid-July until the end of the war. The regiment as a whole was awarded the French Croix de Guerre. In September 1918, Pippin was shot in the right shoulder by a German sniper. The injury initially cost him the use of his arm and always limited his range of motion. He was honorably discharged in 1919. He was retroactively awarded a Purple Heart for his combat injury in 1945. He said of his combat experience: > I did not care what or where I went. I asked God to help me, and he did so. > And that is the way I came through that terrible and Hellish place. For the > whole entire battlefield was hell, so it was no place for any human being to > be.\\"Pippin, Horace.\\" Grolier Encyclopedia of Knowledge, volume 15, copyright > 1991.

He later explained his creative process: \\"The pictures which I have already painted come to me in my mind, and if to me it is a worth while picture, I paint it.\\" He addressed a range of themes, from landscapes and still lifes to biblical subjects and political statements. Some draw on his personal experience of the war or turn-of-the-century domestic life. He was \\"discovered\\" when he submitted two paintings to a local art show‚Äîthe Chester County Art Association (CCAA) Annual Exhibition‚Äîreportedly with the aid and encouragement of various locals, including CCAA co-founders art critic Christian Brinton and artist N.C. Wyeth. Brinton immediately organized a solo exhibition, cosponsored by the CCAA and the interracial West Chester Community Center, connected him with MoMA curators Dorothy Miller and Holger Cahill and, by 1940, the Philadelphia art dealer Robert Carlen and collector Albert C. Barnes. Pippin attended art appreciation classes at the Barnes Foundation in the spring 1940 semester. Carlen, Barnes, and, starting in 1941, dealer Edith Gregor Halpert played prominent roles in Pippin's career. In the eight years between his national debut in the Museum of Modern Art's traveling exhibition ‚ÄúMasters of Popular Painting‚Äù (1938) and his death at the age of fifty-eight, Pippin's recognition grew exponentially across the country and internationally. During this period, he had solo exhibitions in commercial galleries in Philadelphia (1940, 1941) and New York (1940, 1944), and at the Arts Club of Chicago (1941) and San Francisco Museum of Modern Art (1942). Private collections and museums such as the Barnes Foundation, the Philadelphia Museum of Art and the Whitney Museum of American Art acquired his works. His paintings were featured in annual or biennials at the Art Institute of Chicago, Chicago, IL; Carnegie Institute, Pittsburgh, PA; Corcoran Gallery of Art, Washington, D.C.; Pennsylvania Academy of the Fine Arts, Philadelphia, PA; and the Whitney Museum of American Art, New York, as well as thematic surveys at the Dayton Art Institute, OH; National Gallery of Art, Washington, D.C.; Newark Museum, Newark, NJ; and Tate Gallery, London, UK. In the catalogue for one of his memorial exhibitions in 1947, critic Alain Locke described Pippin as \\"a real and rare genius, combining folk quality with artistic maturity so uniquely as almost to defy classification.\\" Artworks Pippin's oeuvre includes a variety of subjects and compositional strategies. He began in the 1920s by burning designs into wood panels‚Äîmostly snow scenes‚Äîand adding paint in one or two colors to highlight specific components of the image. His first oil painting, The Ending of the War, Starting Home (1930‚Äì1933), depicts a scene informed by his experience at the Battle of Sechault, where he was shot. (It does not depict the official German surrender on November 11, 1918, which happened as he was recovering in a French hospital.) He also made the frame and decorated it with hand-carved war materiel, including German and French helmets and weapons. He painted World War I several times thereafter in the 1930s and once more in 1945. Horace Pippin, The Ending of the War, Starting Home, 1930‚Äì1933. Philadelphia Art Museum Pippin painted several religious subjects, both those illustrating Bible passages and more visionary statements like his Holy Mountain series. He was a religious man, staying close to the church throughout his life by teaching Sunday school and singing in his church choir. Horace Pippin, Crucifixion, 1943. Menil Collection. Among Pippin's most celebrated pictures are the three paintings of his Holy Mountain series, which are reminiscent of the bucolic Peaceable Kingdom paintings of Quaker artist Edward Hicks that depict predators and prey together. Pippin includes elements drawn for his own time to suggests that discord and harmony are never too far apart. The wooded backgrounds include soldiers, graveyards, war planes, and bombs that are at odds with the peace depicted in the foreground. In The Knowledge of God and The Holy Mountain III, the tiny brown figure hanging in the trees refers to the ongoing scourge of lynching in the segregated southern United States. He links concepts of destruction and peace by inscribing a significant date from WWI on each of the paintings. The Holy Mountain I is marked with \\"June 6, 1944\\", the date of the Allied landings at Normandy, known as of D-Day. The Knowledge of God is marked \\"Dec. 7 1944,\\" the third anniversary of the attack on Pearl Harbor. Lastly, The Holy Mountain III is marked \\"Aug 9, 1945\\", the day the United Stated dropped an atomic bomb on Nagasaki, Japan. Some have argued that centrally placed shepherd figure resembles the artist. Pippin's dealer Robert Carlen took credit for exposing Pippin to Hicks' series as he was a principle advocate for both self-taught artists. Pippin painted two self portraits, including one seated at the easel. His painting of John Brown Going to his Hanging (1942) is in the collection of the Pennsylvania Academy of the Fine Arts in Philadelphia is part of a trilogy on the abolitionist sometimes credited with igniting the Civil War.

The relatively small image‚Äîabout the size of a magazine cover‚Äîsorts the figures by race. The lower left quadrant is filled with Black uniformed military, a medic, and a machinist, most of whom face forward toward the viewer. Some read the brown-skinned figure at center left, outfitted in an anachronistic WWI uniform, as a self-portrait. A similar group of white men fill the lower right quadrant, most of them turning toward the left. The upper register is dominated by a white man with a sledgehammer driving a wedge into a large V, a reference to the Allies' \\"V for Victory\\" slogan in WWII. African Americans devised the \\"Double V\\" campaign to advocate for military victory abroad and victory over racism at home. At upper left, a large, brown-skinned Statue of Liberty raises her torch to light the way to freedom. On the upper right, a broad, lighter-skinned figure dressed in red holds a noose and stares at Lady Liberty, while a hooded Ku Klux Klansman looms above him.alt= Pippin's genre paintings are among his most popular works; see, for example, the Domino Game (1943), in the Phillips Collection, Washington D.C., and several versions of Cabin in the Cotton. Some, including After Supper (ca. 1935‚Äì1939) and The Milkman of Goshen (1945), relate to his childhood in New York State. Views of the everyday activities of Black families \\"tended to be relatively invisible to the white masses\\" before the Great Migration, so Pippin's domestic scenes offered a privileged view. alt= Pippin also created images related to popular culture, including Old Black Joe, based on the song Old Black Joe; Uncle Tom, based on the novel Uncle Tom's Cabin and its many adaptations, and maybe the musical and film Cabin in the Sky. He made two portraits of the celebrated Black contralto Marian Anderson, not long after her famous 1939 concert on the steps of the Lincoln Memorial, and dedicated a painting to Paul Robeson. Pippin left The Park Bench unfinished in his studio at this death in 1946. Romare Bearden later said: \\"the man, I think, symbolizes Pippin himself, who, having completed his journey and his mission, sits wistfully, in the autumn of the year, all alone on a park bench.\\" Collections and retrospective exhibitions Pippin painted about 140 works, many in museum collections, including the Metropolitan Museum of Art, New York, N.Y.; Hirshhorn Museum and Sculpture Garden, Washington, D.C.; Pennsylvania Academy of the Fine Arts, Philadelphia, PA; Philadelphia Museum of Art, Philadelphia, PA; The Barnes Foundation, Philadelphia, PA; the Brandywine River Museum, Chadds Ford, Pennsylvania; the Phillips Collection, Washington, D.C.; Baltimore Museum of Art, Baltimore, MD; and San Francisco Museum of Modern Art, San Francisco, CA. Pippin was the first African American artist to be the subject of a monograph, Selden Rodman's Horace Pippin: A Negro Painter in America of 1947. He has since been the subject of three major retrospective exhibitions, several scholarly books and articles, a book of poetry, and several children's books. * Horace Pippin.

In 1901 he joined his older brother Joe, both of them being apprentice jockeys at the famous Druids Lodge training establishment in Wiltshire England. Victory on Lemberg in the 1910 Epsom Derby was his most famous achievement although he also rode winners in the 1,000 Guineas (Flair, 1906 and Electra, 1909), Lincoln (Uninsured, 1904), Cambridgeshire (Hacklers Pride, 1905), Eclipse Stakes (Lally, 1907 and dead heated on Lemberg in 1910), Coronation Cup (Pretty Polly, 1906) and the Grand Prix de Paris (Spearmint, 1906). Dillon became the third husband of the Music Hall star Marie Lloyd. They met in 1910 and caused a scandal when, travelling together as \\"Mr. and Mrs. Dillon\\" in 1913, she was refused entry to the United States for \\"moral turpitude\\". Alec Hurley, Lloyd's true husband at the time, died two months later, and Dillon and Lloyd were married at the British Consulate in Portland, Oregon, on 21 February 1914. During World War I, Dillon served in the transport lines at Belton Park, Grantham, the Machine Gun Corps training depot. He was not a good soldier, and was often in trouble. However, Marie Lloyd would travel to Grantham to upbraid any officer who had punished her husband. These officers would often go missing when she arrived. After the war, Dillon began drinking heavily and abusing Lloyd, so that she began drinking as her own escape. In 1920 they separated, but Lloyd continued to slide downhill until she collapsed on stage in October 1922, dying three days later. He was portrayed by actor Tom Payne in the 2007 BBC drama Miss Marie Lloyd - Queen of The Music Hall. Bernard Dillon, nicknamed as \\"Ben\\" in the horseracing community, died in London in May 1941.

It is currently located along the Rideau Canal in Old Ottawa East neighbourhood of Ottawa. Like other Catholic schools, it is publicly funded under the Ontario school system.Immaculata High School -Historical Pamphlet History Immaculata High School Immaculata High School was founded as an all-girls school in 1928 by Reverend J.J. O‚ÄôGorman, acting under the advice of higher ecclesiastical authority. He named the school \\"Immaculata\\", and opened it with an initial enrollment of 85 run by a staff of 3 Grey Sisters as an alternative to public school education for girls of moderate income located at 211 Bronson Avenue. The girls paid a monthly fee of one dollar- if their families could afford it. The site for the new school was the former Christie mansion property on Bronson Avenue at the corner of Lisgar Street, which was purchased for $25,000. W.E. Noffke, a well-known Ottawa architect, designed the school with eight classrooms, a science lab, a home economics classroom, a gymnasium and a stage area, and office space. A passageway linked the school to the former Christie mansion, which became the first convent home for the Grey Sisters who taught at the school. During the construction of the school building, the students of the newly formed Immaculata High School attended classes at St. Patrick‚Äôs Home, at the corner of Laurier Avenue and Kent Street. Sister Loyola was the first principal and the teachers were Sister Agnes of the Sacred Heart and Sister St. Geraldine. By 1929, enrollment had increased to 160 students, and a new building with five classrooms, a science lab and a small library was constructed. In 1929, the first commencement was held and a music department was established. In 1930, enrollment was 200 students and a commercial course was provided. A home economics department and nine new classrooms were added in 1939 to meet the needs of the enrollment of 300 students, taught by nine Sisters. In 1941, Principal Sister Mary Christine supervised a staff of 11. To meet the needs of the camera club, developing facilities and printing rooms were added. In 1948, the enrolment at Immaculata was 425, and the staff now consisted of 17 Sisters. The school's Dr. B. Kearns Memorial Wing, which opened in September 1950, added eight classrooms, including a double-sized commercial classroom and space for the Music Department. In 1952, an addition to the Kearns Memorial Wing added three new classrooms, a students‚Äô library and a principal‚Äôs office. In 1954, a new convent was constructed on the north side of the property. The former convent was renovated into 2 classrooms and space for the Music Department, which had a staff of 4. The enrollment was 725 students and the school now had a staff of 22. In 1962, a chapel/auditorium was built, a project led by principal Sister Mary Christine. In 1967, another building was constructed with 12 classrooms, labs and a gym. Despite this, however, by 1972 the enrollment of Immaculata had dropped to 400 students. As Immaculata celebrated its golden anniversary in 1978, male students were enrolled for the first time. In 1984, grades 7 and 8 students were added. When Immaculata marked its 60th anniversary in 1988, James J. Shea was appointed as the school‚Äôs first lay principal, overseeing an enrollment of 870 students. After Immaculata celebrated its 65th anniversary in September 1994 (after 2 years of major renovations), the school moved to the current location at 140 Main Street. It has been declared an arts academy. The high school's current location was originally built in 1929-1930 to house both St. Patrick's High School and St. Patrick's College (Ottawa), a now defunct Catholic post- secondary institution administered by the Oblate Fathers. In 1973, St. Patrick's sold the building to Algonquin College, who operated a satellite campus there until it sold the building to the Ottawa Roman Catholic Separate School Board to house Immaculata in 1994. Edward Cuhaci was the architect for the renovations undertaken in 1994. In 2000, a satellite classroom site for Immaculata High School was set up in the basement of St. Mary‚Äôs Home, to enable an initial enrollment of 10 pregnant teenagers from all schools in the city to continue with their academics during their pregnancies. The school held its first graduation in June 2000. In January 2002, the program, now called St. Mary‚Äôs Home Community Outreach, moved into 780 rue de l‚ÄôEglise . Immaculata High School celebrated its 75th anniversary in 2003. In 2007, Principal Thomas D'Amico was named one of Canada's Outstanding Principals. The school's sports team is the Immaculata Saints, and the school mascot is the saint bernard 'Bernie Mac'.

In 1988, SAIC won a competition for the original $1.02 billion contract to design, develop, and implement CHCS.Dr. J. Robert Beyster with Peter Economy, The SAIC Solution: How We Built an $8 Billion Employee-Owned Technology Company, John Wiley & Sons (2007) p.88 Components and characteristics CHCS is module based: modules include RAD (radiology), LAB (Laboratory), PHR (Pharmacy), PAS (Patient Appointing & Scheduling), MCP (Managed Care Program; used to support TRICARE enrollees by enrolling them to Primary Care Managers), PAD (Patient Administration): MRT (Medical Records Tracking), MSA (Medical Service Accounting) medical billing, WAM (Workload Assignment Module), DTS (Dietetics), CLN (CLinical: Nursing, Physician, and Allied Health), DAA (Database Administration), ADM (Ambulatory Data Module) Medical Coding of outpatient visits, and TOOLS (FileMan). Currently all appointments are booked in CHCS, except for Walk-Ins and Telephone Consults, which can now be booked in AHLTA. CHCS is a text based BBS/ANSI like display accessed via DEC VT320 terminal emulation. CHCS supports outpatient Order Entry (LAB, RAD, PHR, Consults (ancillary procedures), one-time and scheduled/multiple appointment consults. CHCS can also support Inpatient charting and Order Entry with multi- paging with a page for each ward the patient is transferred, but this feature is not fielded/enabled at many medical centers. Instead Clinicomp's Essentris product is deployed at all MHS hospitals and has replaced the use of CHCS Inpatient module for nurse charting. An interface solution to allow Essentris Orders to be transferred into CHCS order entry is being deployed. AHLTA Armed Forces Health Longitudinal Technology Application (commonly referred to as AHLTA) is the clinical documentation engine for the Physicians to write their notes, put in orders, document procedures performed and provide the basis of medical coding information. This information is then sent into CHCS and its subsystems (ADM - ambulatory data module) provide the official repository of the medical coding information and handle the transmission of those encounters via the Comprehensive Ambulatory Patient Encounter Record (CAPER) interface. The clinical data is brought into the M2 DataMart for use in research, operational metrics, trend analysis, and many other business intelligence processes/products. AHLTA information is also contained in a Central Data Repository (CDR). This CDR contains information from AHLTA, CHCS, and AHLTA-Theater. The AHLTA CDR is a comprehensive full scale world-wide EHR repository. CHCS shares its original codebase with the VA's VistA system. Since its inception it has been customized for supporting the Military and their family members. Security in CHCS works by a number of mechanisms and includes the concept of least privilege. You are assigned the minimum needed for your work duties. This limits your access to sensitive data both protected by the Privacy Act 1974 and PHI protected under HIPAA. AdHoc reports can be written using the FileMan tools and can be quite powerful if the files are designed with that in mind. Many CHCS files are now more easily accessed with MUMPS routines that can make more efficient use of the internal data structures. More information about FileMan can be found at www.hardhats.org. CHCS, which now runs on InterSystems Cach√© with the MUMPS globals being converted into Cach√© objects and the MUMPS routines accessing them, now can be accessed with .NET tools to query the Cach√© database. Many facilities have developed special queries of CHCS or new tools to facilitate workflow and processes. One such tool is an intranet web application to facilitate printing of lab specimen labels to special printers with formats not possible with the regular CHCS print devices and label printing methods. CITPO (now known as Defense Health Information Management Systems (DHIMS)) began the implementation of AHLTA, the DoD's Electronic Health Record (EHR) system, in January 2004. The system links the 481 Military Treatment Facilities (MTF) worldwide as well as service members deployed abroad to the EHR, ultimately supporting 9.2 million MHS beneficiaries. The introduction of AHLTA, previously known as the Composite Health Care System II, ushered in a significant new era in health care for the MHS and the nation. AHLTA Version 3.3.3.X with client update 9.1 currently fielded to physician and clinic staff workstations. DHIMS also manages the AHLTA-Theater program that provides EHR capabilities to deployed users with important store and forward capabilities when communications are unavailable. AHLTA and a significant portion of CHCS are slated to be replaced by a VA/DoD interagency iEHR program. The iEHR will bring together the strong Health IT resources of both the VA and the DoD to acquire the next generation EHR capabilities for both departments. Record Duplication As with all large hospital information systems, there are occasions that despite training and best intentions, duplicate patient records are created. CHCS has a function to merge patients, but not to unmerge. AHLTA also has merges performed on patients in its Oracle database and successful attempts are made to un-merge patients and their associated medical/encounter data where diligent research has determined that mistakes were made with the identification of patients and to split off encounter records from patients that are blended into the single AHLTA record. Master Patient Indexing is a feature of the AHLTA Clinical Data Repository (CDR). Over 100 CHCS host systems, DEERS (Defense Enrollment Eligibility Reporting System), and AHLTA Theater (the version being used in Iraq and other areas) all contributed patients into the CDR when it was created from 25 month data pulls back in 2004. Each CHCS patient registration links into AHLTA, some link to existing patients, but others are newly created. Complexity with patient names and methods of identifying them with other demographics can lead to duplication, both in a local CHCS system and in the central AHLTA CDR. There is currently a DHIMS contract working on improving the processes and automating the routines to resolve duplicate patients and prevent their creation in future.

Stevens, a Friends Ambulance Unit ambulance driver, with his vehicle in Wolfsburg, Germany, possibly 1945 The Friends' Ambulance Unit (FAU) was a volunteer ambulance service, founded by individual members of the British Religious Society of Friends (Quakers), in line with their Peace Testimony. The FAU operated from 1914‚Äì1919, 1939‚Äì1946 and 1946‚Äì1959 in 25 different countries around the world. It was independent of the Quakers' organisation and chiefly staffed by registered conscientious objectors. History =First World War= Civilian hospital evacuation at B√©thune, Pas-de-Calais during the First World War; drawing by FAU volunteer Ernest Procter The Unit was founded as The First Anglo-Belgian Ambulance Unit at the start of World War I in 1914 and later renamed the Friends' Ambulance Unit. Members were trained at Jordans, a hamlet in Buckinghamshire, that was a centre for Quakerism. Altogether it sent over a thousand men to France and Belgium, where they worked on ambulance convoys and ambulance trains with the French and British armies. The FAU came under the jurisdiction of the British Red Cross Society. It was dissolved in 1919. =Second World War and aftermath= It was refounded by a committee of former members at the start of World War II in September 1939 with the establishment of a training camp at Manor Farm, Bristol Road, Northfield, Birmingham. More than 1,300 members were trained and went on to serve as ambulance drivers and medical orderlies in London during the Blitz, as well as overseas in Finland, Norway and Sweden (1940), the Middle East (1940‚Äì1943), Greece (1941, 1944‚Äì1946), China and Syria (1941‚Äì1946), India and Ethiopia (1942‚Äì1945), Italy (1943‚Äì1946), France, Belgium, Netherlands, Yugoslavia and Germany (1944‚Äì1946) and Austria (1945‚Äì1946). Its first female member was Angela Sinclair-Loutit, who joined in 1940 after her studies at Somerville College, Oxford were interrupted. China Convoy The Sino-Japanese War had led to deteriorating conditions in China and in 1941 agreement was reached for the FAU to deploy 40 volunteers to deliver medical aid (dubbed the \\"China Convoy\\"). At first, their job was to secure the delivery of supplies via the \\"Burma Road\\", the sole remaining route. When Burma fell to the Japanese in May 1942, the FAU volunteers escaped to India and China. They regrouped and took on the distribution of medical supplies delivered by \\"The Hump\\", the air transport route to Kunming. It is estimated that 80% of medical supplies to China were distributed by the FAU. The FAU's role expanded and they provided a range medical treatments, preventative measures and training of Chinese medical personnel. This expanded further into the reconstruction of medical facilities, notably the hospital at Tengchong in 1944, and into agricultural improvements and training. The activities in China were international, employing personnel, men and women, from Britain (the largest national group), China, United States, Canada, New Zealand and elsewhere. Around 200 foreigners took part, eight died and others had their health permanently damaged. About half of the recruits were Quakers but all had a commitment to pacifism and wished to deliver practical help. Responsibility for the relief work in China was passed to the American Friends Service Committee in 1946. Northern Europe Two 12-man sections with eight vehicles, FAU Relief Sections Nos 1 and 2, landed at Arromanches, Normandy on 6 September 1944 from a tank landing craft. Attached to the British Army's civilian affairs branch, the FAU sections provided relief to civilians in Normandy. No 2 FAU was then posted to a newly liberated refugee camp at Leopoldsburg, Belgium, managing reception, registration, disinfection, catering, dormitories and departures. In November 1944, in response to a request from 21st Army Group, a further five more sections were established and arrived in Europe at the end of 1944. One new member was Gerald Gardiner, who subsequently became Lord Chancellor in Harold Wilson's Labour Party government of 1964‚Äì1970. After a period in Nijmegen, assisting local civilian medical organisations during Operation Market Garden, No 2 FAU cared for a colony of the mentally ill near Cleves in Germany which grew to a population of 25,000. By April, the main work had become the accommodation and care of displaced persons until they could return home. No 2 FAU was heavily involved with the care and support of inmates at the newly liberated Stalag X-B prisoner-of-war camp near Sandbostel, between Bremen and Hamburg in northern Germany in May 1945. The FAU was wound up in 1946 and replaced by the Friends Ambulance Unit Post-War Service, which continued until 1959. The work of the Friends' Ambulance Unit was referred to in the 1947 award of the Nobel Peace Prize to Quakers worldwide and accepted by the Friends Service Council and the American Friends Service Committee. Purpose The original trainees in the 1939 training camp issued a statement expressing their purpose: > We purpose to train ourselves as an efficient Unit to undertake ambulance > and relief work in areas under both civilian and military control, and so, > by working as a pacifist and civilian body where the need is greatest, to > demonstrate the efficacy of co-operating to build up a new world rather than > fighting to destroy the old. While respecting the views of those pacifists > who feel they cannot join an organization such as our own, we feel concerned > among the bitterness and conflicting ideologies of the present situation to > build up a record of goodwill and positive service, hoping that this will > help to keep uppermost in men's minds those values which are so often > forgotten in war and immediately afterwards.

The concept of Helen of Troy's eidolon was explored both by Homer and Euripides. However, where Homer uses the concept as a free-standing idea that gives Helen life after death, Euripides entangles it with the idea of kleos, one being the product of the other. Both Euripides and Stesichorus, in their respective works concerning the Trojan Horse, claim that Helen was never physically present in the city at all. Literary use The concept of the eidola of the dead was explored in various literature regarding Penelope, who in later works was constantly laboring against the eidola of Clytamnestra and later Helen herself. Homer's use of eidola also extends to the Odyssey where, after the death of the suitors, Theoclymenos notes that he sees the doorway of the court filled with them. In The Mill on the Floss, (1860) by George Eliot, eidolon is used to describe Mr Tulliver's prejudicial image of his antagonist, Mr Wakem; Book Third, Chapter 7. Walt Whitman's poem by the same name in 1876 used a much broader understanding of the term, expanded and detailed in the poem. In Whitman's use of the term we can see the use broaden to include the concept of an oversoul composed of the individual souls of all life and expanding to include the Earth itself and the hierarchy of the planets, Sun, stars and galaxy. In Theosophy, the astral double or perispirit or kamarupa after death, before its disintegration, is identified with the eidolon.Encyclopedic Theosophical Glossary: A Resource on Theosophy, G. de Purucker Modern fiction * In The Mark of Athena by Rick Riordan, three eidola appear as antagonists, possessing characters and making them fight against each other. * In the short story \\"The White Ship\\" by H.

'Harley Bretz' was his given name, but it just didn't ring a bell for him; maybe he didn't think it sounded professional enough.\\" Says Bretz's daughter Rhoda Bretz Riley in the book Bretz's Flood page 12. Bretz's Flood, by John Soennichsen, published by Sasquatch Books Seattle, Copyright 2008 . (September 2, 1882 ‚Äì February 3, 1981) was an American geologist, best known for his research that led to the acceptance of the Missoula Floods and for his work on caves. Early career Bretz earned an AB degree in biology from Albion College in 1905, then started his career as a high school History and Physiography (study of the physical features of the Earth's surface) teacher in Seattle. During this time he became interested in the geology of Eastern Washington state, and began studying the glacial geology of the Puget Sound area. He continued his studies at the University of Chicago where he earned his Ph.D. in geology in 1913. He became an assistant professor of geology, first at the University of Washington and then the University of Chicago. The Spokane floods: an outrageous hypothesis In the summer of 1922, and for the next seven years, Bretz conducted field research of the Columbia River Plateau. Between the Summer of 1922 through 1931 he wrote 15 papers. Since 1910 he had been interested in unusual erosion features in the area after seeing a newly published topographic map of the Potholes Cataract. Bretz coined the term Channeled Scablands in 1923 to describe the area near the Grand Coulee, where massive erosion had cut through basalt deposits.Bretz, J Harlen (1923). \\"The Channeled Scabland of the Columbia Plateau\\". Journal of Geology 31: 617‚Äì649. The area was a desert, but Bretz's theories required cataclysmic water flows to form the landscape, for which Bretz coined the term Spokane Floods in a 1925 publication.Bretz, J Harlen (1925). \\"The Spokane flood beyond the Channeled Scablands\\". Journal of Geology 33: 97‚Äì115, 236‚Äì259. DOI:10.1086/623179 Bretz published a paper in 1923, arguing that the Channeled Scablands in Eastern Washington were caused by massive flooding in the distant past. This was seen as arguing for a catastrophic explanation of the geology, against the prevailing view of uniformitarianism, and Bretz's views were initially discredited. However, as the nature of the Ice Age was better understood, Bretz's original research was vindicated, and by the 1950s his conclusions were also vindicated. Bretz encountered resistance to his theories from the geology establishment of the day. The geology establishment was resistant to such a sweeping theory for the origin of a broad landscape for a variety of reasons, including lack of familiarity with the remote areas of the interior Pacific Northwest where the research was based, and the lack of status and reputation of Bretz in the eyes of the largely Ivy League-based geology elites. Furthermore, his theory implied the potential possibilities of a Biblical flood, which the scientific community strongly rejected.PBS documentary The Geological Society of Washington, D.C invited the young Bretz to present his previously published research at a 12 January 1927 meeting where several other geologists presented competing theories. Bretz saw this as an ambush, and referred to the group as six \\"challenging elders\\". Their intention was to defeat him in a public debate, and thereby end the challenge his theories posed to their conservative interpretation of uniformitarianism. Another geologist at the meeting, J. T. Pardee, had worked with Bretz and had evidence of an ancient glacial lake that lent credence to Bretz's theories. Pardee, however, lacked the academic freedom of Bretz (he worked for the United States Geological Survey) and did not enter the fray. Bretz defended his theories, kicking off an acrimonious 40 year debate over the origin of the Scablands. As he wrote in 1928, \\"Ideas without precedent are generally looked upon with disfavor and men are shocked if their conceptions of an orderly world are challenged.\\"Quote engraved on monument outside the Dry Falls Museum in Coulee City WA Both Pardee and Bretz continued their research over the next 30 years, collecting and analyzing evidence that eventually identified Lake Missoula as the source of the Spokane Floods and creator of the Channeled Scablands. Research on open channel hydraulics and NASA satellite images in the 1970s further vindicated Bretz's and Pardee's theories. Caves and karst Bretz wrote an extremely influential paper on the morphology and origin of limestone caves (1942) together with detailed studies of the caves of Missouri (1956) and Illinois (with Stanley Harris, 1961). Personal life Bretz was of German heritage. He was born to Oliver Joseph Bretz and Rhoda Maria Howlett, farmers in Saranac, Michigan, the oldest of five children. Bretz and his wife Fanny, whom he had met at Albion College, had two children, Rudolf Challis Bretz and Rhoda Bretz Riley. The Bretz family settled in Homewood, Illinois where they bought property and constructed a Sears Catalog Home on it in 1921. Bretz nicknamed the property \\"Boulderstrewn\\" because of all the rocks and minerals he collected and was given that were placed around the property. He donated a portion of this collection to Albion College in the 1970s . Boulderstrewn was renowned for being an active place where Bretz hosted many parties with students and faculty from the University of Chicago. His post-retirement body of work includes Geology of the Chicago Region (1955), The Caves of Missouri (1956), Washington's Channeled Scabland (1959), Caves of Illinois (1961), and Geomorphic History of the Ozarks (1965) -- in addition to his 1949 Incomplete Genealogy of the Family of John Bretz Of Fairfield Co., Ohio, with a Partial History of One Line of Descent in this Family. Awards and honors The National Speleological Society made Bretz an honorary member in 1954. Bretz received the Penrose Medal, the Geological Society of America's highest award, in 1979, at the age of 96.Penrose Medal 1979 to J Harlen Bretz, Geological Society of America After this award, he told his son: \\"All my enemies are dead, so I have no one to gloat over.\\" Each year at Albion College, the J Harlen Bretz Award is given to the most outstanding senior in the geology department. Bretz Drive in Homewood, Illinois was named in his honor. A plaque was dedicated to Bretz in 1994 outside the Visitor Center at Dry Falls State Park in Coulee City, Washington that reads \\"Dedicated to J Harlen Bretz who patiently taught us that catastrophic floods may sometimes play a role in nature's unfolding drama\\".

Former Governor of the Brazilian Central Bank, is best known for being one of the \\"fathers\\" of the Real Plan, the 1994 monetary reform that ended hyperinflation in Brazil. He teaches economics at the Catholic University in Rio de Janeiro since 1986. He is also a businessman, consultant and has served on many boards. He founded Rio Bravo Investimentos where he works as Senior Advisor. He has written several books, academic papers and contributes regularly to newspapers and magazines. Early life and studies Franco was born in Rio de Janeiro on April 10, 1956. His mother Maria Isabel Barbosa de Barroso Franco, was from Te√≥filo Otoni, province of Minas Gerais, and his father, Guilherme Arinos Lima Verde de Barroso Franco, was born in Itacoatiara, at the backlands of the state of Amazonas. Guilherme Arinos made a career at Banco do Brasil and during the war started a lifelong friendship and association to President Get√∫lio Vargas. Arinos was a member of the first board of directors of the Brazilian National Development Bank, BNDES, and later, at the private sector, was a high ranked executive of Volkswagen do Brasil and one of the founders of Banco Garantia. Gustavo Franco attended Col√©gio S√£o Vicente de Paulo in Rio de Janeiro and Col√©gio Notre Dame de Sion in 1960/1974. He obtained a bachelor's (1975‚Äì1979) and master's (1983) degree in economics at the Pontif√≠cia Universidade Cat√≥lica do Rio de Janeiro (PUC-Rio), where he developed interests in economic history and macroeconomics. At PUC-Rio he had his first job as teaching assistant working with Edmar Bacha, then preparing a macroeconomic textbook, self-defined as of a neo-structuralist approach, and later to become very popular in Brazil, with several editionsEdmar Lisboa Bacha Introdu√ß√£o √† macroeconomia: uma perspectiva brasileira. Rio de Janeiro, Editora Campus, 1982, Winston Fritsch was his advisor in his M. A. thesis on the topic of financial euphoria and crash in the early years of the Brazilian Republic (1889-1890) and the attempts at monetary reform in connection either adhering to the gold standard or, alternatively to experience with fiat currency models, as proposed by Ruy Barbosa. His M. A. thesis was approved cum landae in 1982 and in 1983 won the prestigious \\"Pr√™mio BNDES de Economia\\" for the M. A. thesis in Brazil. This work was published as a book titled Monetary reform and instability during the republican transition (\\"Reforma monet√°ria e instabilidade durante a transi√ß√£o republicana\\"\\") and became a reference to the period it covers. In sequence, Franco was accepted in Ph.D programs in the universities of Chicago, Yale and Harvard, for which he headed. There he chose as fields of specialization, international economics under Jeffrey Sachs and economic history under Barry Eichengreen. He had brief fellowships at the CFIA (Center for International Affairs), CES (Centre for European Studies) and National Bureau of Economic Research (NBER). Sachs and Eichengreen were his supervisors, and along with MIT professor Lance Taylor, formed his thesis committee. Franco earned his Ph.D Degree at Harvard in 1986, with a dissertation titled Aspects of the Economics of Hyperinflations: Theoretical Issues and Historical Studies of Four European Hyperinflations of the 1920sA revised version of the dissertation is available at http://gustavofranco.com.br/temas/9.. His original thesis had four theoretical chapters on topics as the adoption of indexation in contracts, inflation (stabilization) as public good problem, plagued by free rider issues, the inflation tax as motivation to the process and the dynamics of dollarization, distributive tensions and external balance. The applied chapters were case studies for Germany, Austria, Hungary, and Poland, also including some common themes like the relation between external imbalances, dollarization and fiscal reforms in the context of specific stabilization experiences. This work was nominated to the David Wells Prize in Harvard and was awarded a national prize (\\"Pr√™mio Haralambos Simionides\\") in 1987, for the best Ph.D thesis or book in economics, given by the National Association of Graduate Studies in Economics (ANPEC, Associa√ß√£o Nacional de Centros de P√≥s Gradua√ß√£o em Economia).  Teaching and research  Returning to Brazil in 1986, as a faculty member at the Economics Department at PUC-Rio, Franco worked as teacher, researcher and consultant from 1986 to 1993 when he was called to work with Fernando Henrique Cardoso, the newly nominated Finance Minister then starting his tenure. He had an intense academic activity during these years; his research interests had three key themes: (i) on high inflation and on the basis of topics and issues raised in his doctoral dissertation; (ii) on Brazil's economic history, mostly in connection with macroeconomic and monetary issues; and (iii) on trade policies, multinational enterprises and economic development, in collaboration with Winston Fritsch. = Hyperinflation = Two papers out of specific chapters of his doctoral dissertation were published in peer reviewed journals and had some relevant repercussion on his later work of fighting hyperinflation in Brazil: \\"Fiscal Reforms and Stabilization: four hyperinflation cases examined\\" was published in The Economic Journal (vol. 100, no. 399, March 1990) disputed Thomas Sargent's popular explanation to the sudden end of hyperinflation as result of a wide-ranging fiscal \\"regime change\\". The role of dollarization and of currency reforms were wrongly downplayed by Sargent, as argued by Franco. \\"The Rentenmark Miracle\\" published by Rivista di Storia Economica (Second Series, Volume 4, 1987), then republished in Barry Eichengreen (ed.) Monetary Regime Transformations London, Edward Elgar Publishing Ltd, 1991, was an account of the unique experience in Germany of Wertbestandiges Notgeld - that is, emergency monies of private issuance and with \\"stable value\\" as they had indexation clauses -, and the way this led to the rentenmark experience. As argued by Franco the rentenmark was a crucial step in the German stabilization, and not a \\"cosmetic measure\\", as put by Thomas SargentThomas J. Sargent \\"The Ends of Four Big Inflations‚Äù, in Robert E. Hall (org.), Inflation: Causes and Effects. Chicago, The University of Chicago Press.. In fact, the rentenmark model was very relevant for the design of the Brazilian 1994 monetary reform, known as \\"Real Plan\\", in which a similar quasi-currency, under the name o URV (acronym for Unidade Real de Valor) played a vital role for the ending of Brazilian hyperinflationA summary of the Brazilian high inflation experience written by Franco can be found in \\"The political economy of the Brazilian hyperinflation\\" in Maria D'Alva G. Kinzo (org.) Brazil: challenges for the 1990s. London, Institute of Latin American Studies & British Academic Press,1993.. Much later, in 1995, Thomas Sargent wrote an article on the Brazilian URV, evoking the German experience with the rentenmark and arguing, as per the mathematician David Hilbert, that one could not solve the hyperinflation problem by \\"changing the name of the independent variable\\"Thomas J. Sargent, \\"Reasonable doubt about the Real Plan\\" reproduced in Rational expectations and inflation, Third Edition, Princeton, Princeton University Press, p. 241, .. The URV, argued Sargent, would have been \\"a sideshow that hasn't touched the fundamental causes of inflation\\"Ibidem, p. 242., and again Franco took issue with that, writing in 2017, but this time on the back of the successful adoption of the URV mechanism. According to Franco: \\"Understandably\\", Brazilians \\"did not take these observations seriously\\" as \\"the country was enchanted by the URV mechanism in view of practical problems it solved elegantly, efficiently and voluntarily, so that they received with blunt indifference a thesis from an outside observer claiming that the mechanism had no utility\\" Gustavo H. B. Franco. A moeda e a lei: uma hist√≥ria monet√°ria brasileira, 1933-2013. Rio de Janeiro, Zahar, 2017, , p. 648.. = Economic history = In sequence to the work on monetary reforms in the early years of the Republic, Franco published several pieces on the Brazilian monetary experience in the years prior to the Great Depression. All this work is in Portuguese except \\"Aspects of the Brazilian Experience with the Gold Standard\\", in Pablo Mat√≠n Ace√±a and Jaime Reis (orgs.) Monetary standards in the periphery: paper, silver and gold, 1854-1933 (London, Macmillan Press. 2000). Later, his research on the early years of the Republic would communicate well with his work of Machado de Assis newspapers articles as per his selection of chronicles under the title \\"O olhar obliquo do acionista\\" ( \\"Shareholders oblique look\\", as literal translation). = Foreign trade and multinational companies = Franco worked in collaboration with Winston Fritsch in a series of projects supported by the OECD Development Center. One publication was Foreign direct investment and industrial restructuring: issues and trends (Development Centre Studies, OECD Development Centre, OECD, Paris, 1991), another was \\"Efficient Industrialization in a Technologically Dependent Economy: The Current Brazilian Debate\\" in Competition and Economic Development Committee of Competition Law and Policy, OECD, 1991. In sequence, Franco and Fritsch worked in two projects directed by Gerry Helleiner for WIDER (World Institute for Development Economics Research) of the United Nations University during 1990 and 1991. The first was on the influence of trade orientation on development models and was published as \\"Foreign Direct investment and patterns of trade and industrialization in developing countries: notes with reference to the Brazilian experience\\" in G. K. Helleiner (org.) Trade Policy, Industrialization and Development: a reconsideration. (Oxford, Clarendon Press for UNU-Wider, 1992 ). The second, on the same issues but focused on trade and industrial policies was published as \\"Import repression, productivity slowdown, and manufactured export dynamism: Brazil,1975-1990\\" in Gerry Helleiner (org.) Trade policy and industrialization in turbulent times (London: Routledge for UNU-Wider, 1993, ). Franco and Fritsch also worked in projects for UNCTADTrade policy issues in Brazil in the 1990s. Report prepared for UNCTAD.

Franco would return to these themes only after 1995 when, as deputy governor of the Central Bank responsible for international affairs organized a Census on foreign direct investment into Brazil that has been conducted and published each five years since 1995.  Public service  Between 1993 and 1999, Franco was active in public service. He started in May 1993 as Deputy Secretary of Economic Policy at the Finance Ministry up to October 1993 when he moved to the Central Bank of Brazil in the position of Deputy Governor responsible for International Affairs, position he occupied until 1997, and only interrupted by a brief tenure as governor of the Central Bank of Brazil between December 1994 and January 1995. In August 20th, 1997 he was confirmed governor of the Central Bank of Brazil, until leaving on January 9th, 1999, and briefly returning in March 1999 to transfer his functions to his successor Arminio Fraga. = Economic Policy Secretary = Franco served as Deputy Economic Policy Secretary at the Finance Ministry from May to October 1993 by invitation from the newly appointed Minister, Fernando Henrique Cardoso, the fourth Finance Minister of president Itamar Franco, who had become president in December 1992 after the resignation of Fernando Collor de Mello. The other economists in the group were Winston Fristch, as Secretary of Economic Policy and Edmar Bacha as special adviser. In his memoir, Cardoso recollects that ‚Äúwith a small team facing a gigantic challenge, as a Brancaleone‚Äôs Army, ... we started to work, under a very discouraging political atmosphere‚Äù. This team faced a paradoxical pressure: not to repeat economic shocks and to produce some solution to inflation, then approaching 30% per month. The team's first major announcement was described by Franco, as a ‚Äúnon-package‚Äù or rather ‚Äúan ambitious collection of medium term fundamentalists agendas‚Äù, curiously named as PAI (acronym for Plano de A√ß√£o Imediata, Plan of Immediate Action), released on June 13th, 1993. In sharp contrast with previous stabilization attempts, this document seemed to point that the Real Plan would start by the end offering ‚Äúsome sort of strategic planning of actions in issues associated with the so-called fiscal and monetary fundamentals to stabilization‚Äù. = Deputy Governor for International Affairs at the Central Bank = Franco was appointed Deputy Governor for International Affairs at the Central Bank on September 8th, 1993 when Pedro Malan was appointed Governor. Simultaneously, P√©rsio Arida was designated president of BNDES, and Andr√© Lara Rezende replaced Malan was chief negotiator of then pending Brazilian external debt. With this enlarged composition, the economic team around minister Cardoso started preparations towards the Real Plan. In parallel, Franco had executive responsibilities in International Affairs at the Central Bank related to operational aspects of external debt restructuring under the Brady Plan, then at decisive moments, the administrative structures in charge of exchange controls, bound to be transformed by an ambitious deregulation process, the FOREX trading desk and international reserves management.  External debt, Brady Plan and new bond issues  At the moment Franco and Malan started working together at the Central Bank, the debt negotiation process was around the precise form of exchange of Brazilian currency denominated deposits owned by creditors (under the MYDFAs, Multi Year Deposit Facility Agreement) for newly issued bonds according to the Brady plan‚Äôs menu. In the final sequence of this process, Franco was in charge of the composition of the collateral guaranties for the new bonds under the Brady scheme. These guaranties would take the form of US Treasury Zero Coupon bonds with certain features, with a face value of approximately US$ 18 billion (and market value of US$ 2,8 billion) to be acquired with funds provided by the IMF under a stand-by agreement. However, IMF representatives did not feel comfortable with the drafts of the Real Plan shown during the negotiations of the stand-by agreement and refused to go on with the loan, forcing the Brazilian authorities to develop some alternative strategy to acquire the US Treasury bonds in the secondary market using Brazil‚Äôs international reserves. The deal was described in detail in Guilherme Fiuza‚Äôs book in the chapter titled Sorry, Mr. Fagenbaum. Right next to completing Brazil‚Äôs Brady Plan version, simultaneously with the Real Plan, Franco dealt with Paris Club debt and the Dart family, who did not wish to adhere to the Brady exchange. With these issues sorted out the challenge for the Republic was to return to international markets with new bonds and proceed with the building of a yield curve. The new program coordinated and executed by Franco comprised 16 new issues in 10 different currencies, between 1995 and 1998, totaling US$ 8,2 billion, including the issuance of the so called \\"BR-27\\" (the first 30-year bond voluntarily issued in decades, falling due in 2027) in exchange for cash and for Brady bonds, thus recovering the previously offered collateral in US Treasury bondsSee Ceres A. Cerqueira's account in https://www.bcb.gov.br/htms/infecon/dividarevisada/03%20publica%C3%A7%C3%A3o%20completa.pdf.  Forex deregulation and phasing out exchange controls  Exchange controls deregulation was one of the greatest challenges of the International Affairs section of the Brazilian Central Bank, a modernization imperative and an essential condition for the prevalence of supply and demand as determinants of the exchange rate. The architecture of liberalization was based on the creation of new and segregated market for US Dollars in which rates were determined by supply and demand in parallel to the official market and to compete upfront with the ‚Äúblack market‚Äù. Initially fed only by Dollars sold by tourists, the scope of transactions was gradually extended, while, liberalization in the official market, along with a better balance of payments stance, resulted in gradually eliminating the spread between official and free markets. From 1988 to 2006, when all legal markets were unified, deregulation consisted in expanding the nature of transactions that could take place in the free market, including gold related arbitrages, and remittances from non- resident local currency accountsKnown as ‚ÄúCC5 accounts‚Äù, after Carta Circular n.5 of 1969, the regulatory reference of such accounts., though always preserving full identification of players. After 1995, under Franco's direction, the Central Bank introduced several new rules for leads and lags in foreign trade, portfolio investment and turned ‚Äúregistry‚Äù of foreign capital inflows into a statistical event, and no longer dependent on authorization. Interestingly, however, one key innovation introduced along with liberalization of outflows was the selective restriction applied on certain types of inflows, mostly of a short-term nature. Capital surges had been producing restrictive measures in many countries, most visibly (for Brazilians) Chile, where restrictions took the form of a ‚Äúquarantine‚Äù, or a minimum stay for foreign capital. In Brazil, instead, restrictions were implemented mostly as a tax of foreign exchange inflows, and without any ‚Äúquarantine‚Äù. The formula was used many times over in later moments of foreign exchange abundance in order to reduce appreciation and/or the extend maturities of foreign liabilitiesFor a review and discussion see ‚ÄúCapital inflows into , 1992-98: the nature and effects of controls and restrictions‚Äù in Sebastian Edwards & Marcio Garcia (orgs.) Financial markets volatility and performance in emerging markets, Chicago, The University of Chicago Press & NBER.. Plano Real The Real Plan had as central element a monetary reform effected through three successive measures: the first and more important introduced in February 28th, 1994Medida Provis√≥ria 434, issued February 27th, 1994 late turned into Law 8.880, in May 27th 1994., created the URV (Unidade Real de Valor) mechanism, that is, a \\"money of account\\" to be freely used in contracts and obligations in order to realign relative prices and coordinate price fixing around the exchange rate. It was also established that at some point in the near future, the URV would become the national legal tender to replace then circulating cruzeiros reais. Just like the German rentenmark, and reflected also previous models of monetary reform conceived by Andr√© Lara Rezende and Persio AridaThe model proposed in 1985, and the became known as the \\"Larida Plan\\" was never attempted in its original format, as published as \\"Inertial Inflation and Monetary Reform: Brazil\\" in John Williamson (org.), Inflation and Indexation: Argentina, Brazil and Israel. Washington, Institute for International Economics, 1985.. At this moment, the new national currency, the URV would have its denomination conveniently changed to real. The second, launched at July 1st. 1994Medida Provis√≥ria 542, issued June 30th 1994, later approved as Law 9.069 in June 29th 1995., complemented the reform, demonetizing cruzeiros reais and actually issuing the real. Also, this second instrument introduced some very important institutional changes in monetary governance, with a major reform in the National Monetary Council, and monetary policy. The third, closing the cycle of monetary reform, was a detailed statute for indexation practices that was implemented exactly one year after the real was first issuedMedida Provis√≥ria 1.053 issued in June 30th 1995, was reennacted many times until final approval as Law 10.192 in February 14th, 2001.. The URV existed as legal tender, though only as unit of account, during four months: its initial quote with respect to cruzeiro real was CR$ 647,50, more or less equivalent to one Dollar, as it was its final quote as CR$ 2.750,00, on July 1st, 1994, when the cruzeiro real was demonetized and the URV was turned into the national currency and renamed as real. In consequence of this unusual parity it was not possible to stamp old cruzeiros reais notes, so that one entirely new family of notes was issued at once, a remarkably difficult logistics effort At the day of the first issues of the new currency, in an unprecedented move, the Central Bank abstained from intervening in the foreign exchange market and let the new currency float. In consequence, the exchange rate between the URV (now the real) and the Dollar, fell below R$ 1,00 (i. e. it appreciated) with a great positive impact on expectations and marking the successful conclusion of the stabilization process first phase. The combination of tight monetary policy with floating exchange rates, later under a \\"target zone regime\\", or \\"exchange rate bands\\", resulted immensely successful to eliminate hyperinflation, but remained one of the more controversial aspects of the Brazilian stabilization experience, and one generally addressed to FrancoSee Gustavo H. B. Franco. ‚ÄúThe Real Plan and the Exchange Rate‚Äù Essays in International Finance n. 217, April 2000. International Finance Section, Department of Economics, .. The results of the Real Plan on inflation, as measured by national cost of living index, IPCA - published by the National Statistics Bureau - IBGE, were as follows:inflation was running at 43,1% monthly (on average for he first semester of 1994), or 7.260% annually, up to July 1994, the first month of existence of the new currency. In July alone prices rose 6,8%, but the accumulated inflation for the next twelve months was only 33,0%. From this level onward, inflation goes on declining slowly: measured by IPCA, inflation fell below 20%, on a 12 months accumulated basis, only in April 1996, 22nd month after the introduction of the new currency; below 10% only in December, 30th month of the real. Within the calendar year of 1997, the rate of inflation was 5,2%, and in 1998 inflation was finally reduced to 1,6%, the lowest rate on record since the creation of the Brazilian Central Bank in 1964. = Institutional aspects and \\"fundamentals\\" = Before the Real Plan, five stabilization attempts failed between 1986 and 1991 all of which involving price freezes, all but one creating a new currency and one, the so-called Collor Plan in 1990, with an asset freeze much like monetary reforms in Europe following World War IIAs extensively described in John G. Gurley, ‚ÄúExcess liquidity and European monetary reforms, 1944-1952‚Äù American Economic Review XLIII March, 1953. Reproduced in Barry Eichengreen (org.) Monetary Regime Transformations, Cambridge, Elgar Reference Collection, 1992. These failed experiments were called \\"heterodox shocks\\" not only because of direct intervention in prices and intrusive currency reforms, but also for their practical disregard of fiscal \\"fundamentals\\" and monetary policies. The Real Plan followed a different path opening several reforms agendas attacking fundamental disequilibria at the core of the hyperinflation process. The first was related to the institutional organization of the monetary system. the National Monetary Council was recaptured and reduced to three members (ministers of Finance and Planning and the Governor of the Central Bank), recomposing the commitment of top level decision making to price stability. Sometime later a Monetary Policy Committee (known as COPOM - acronym of Comit√™ de Pol√≠tica Monet√°ria) was created securing Central Bank's independence in fixing the interest rate. Next, federal banks, and especially Banco do Brasil, had to recognize previous losses, be recapitalized, abide by \\"Basle Rules\\" and cease to have unrestricted accommodation at the Central Bank. Provincial banks entered a severe adjustment program through which several liquidations and privatizations reduced their size to almost negligible. Some private banks in trouble entered a program through which the Central Bank financed liquidations, resolutions and changes in control of banking activities. It was a heavy agenda with the banking system, public and private, to reorder the monetary system and its governance. There were numerous fiscal adjustment initiatives, starting with several rounds of debt refinancing with adjustment programs with the states during 1993-1998. The Federal Government gave accommodation to states in exchange for orthodox fiscal programs and several limitations as to their fiscal policies. These programs templates provided a framework to a new Public Finances Law, proposed in 1999, creating benchmarks and limitations for indebtedness and wages expenses, later approved under the designation \\"Fiscal Responsibility Law\\", held to be a major progress in securing fiscal balance in the public sector in Brazil . Another important initiative was the 1993 Constitutional Amendment known as Social Emergency Fund (Fundo Social de Emerg√™ncia, approved during the constitutional revision in March, 1993) which removed most of earmarking in the budget, and allowing the National Treasury to regain control of budgeted expenses. Even so, primary fiscal results were weak during the first few years after 1994. Due to the advancement of reforms, these weak fiscal numbers did not become an issue until the Asian crisis in 1997 and especially in 1998 with the Russian crisis, when Brazil entered an agreement with the IMF and started a decade long period of primary surpluses at the level of 3% of GDP. Franco left the Central Bank after the IMF Agreement and after the reelection of Fernando Henrique Cardoso for a second term in 1998. Franco received late in 1998 Euromoney's prize ‚ÄúCentral Banker of the year, 1998‚ÄùAccording to Brian Caplen (Euromoney, IMF Meeting Issue, September 1998, pp. 126-127), \\"Gustavo Franco‚Äôs bold use of power: Brazil long needed a heavyweight in the central bank chair and now it‚Äôs got one. Gustavo Franco earned his spurs in last October‚Äôs Asia meltdown. His policy regime, especially the use of capital controls, is being studied around the world‚Äù.. Shortly after, Brazil moved into what was known as the \\"tripoid\\" policy: floating exchange rates, primary fiscal surplus and inflation targets. Brazil was ready, at this point, to switch from the exchange rate \\"anchor\\" into the inflation targets regime. Franco's account of controversies around the use of the exchange rate in the stabilization effort and of the dialogue between short term policies and long term reform goals was laid out in several of his writings, some in EnglishMost notably Gustavo H. B. Franco. ‚ÄúThe Real Plan and the Exchange Rate‚Äù Essays in International Finance n. 217, April 2000. International Finance Section, Department of Economics, Princeton..  Rio Bravo Investimentos  After a sabbatical year back at the Catholic University as full-time professor, Franco founded an investment company named Rio Bravo Investimentos, based in S√£o Paulo, to manage mutual funds, structured products, and private equity, in association with Swiss Re. In August 2001 Rio Bravo acquired a broker dealer called Mercurio DTVM and started to manage REITs (Real Estate Investment Trusts) and also with the public distribution of securities. Rio Bravo developed investment banking activities from 2003, when it acquired the local operation of Dresdner Kleinworth Benson, until 2007 when these activities were transferred to Lehman Brothers. Rio Bravo was active in private equity first through Rio Bravo Nordeste I FMIEE (focused on SMEs in the Northeast region), later, in 2007, with Rio Bravo Nordeste II, the largest regional private equity fund in the country. In February 2006 Rio Bravo acquired MVP Mercatto Venture Partners Ltda., renamed as Rio Bravo Venture Partners Ltda., a venture capital management company based in Rio de Janeiro. Later, in October 2010, Rio Bravo raised its first private equity fund dedicated to investments in renewable energy. In 2005 a Rio Bravo started Rio Bravo Project Finance Ltd to advise clients in infrastructure projects and also Rio Bravo Fundamental, a value driven listed equity mutual fund. In May 2008 Rio Bravo spun off its real estate based securitization business into a new company called RB Capital, with no shareholding from Rio Bravo partners. In 2016 RB Capital had its control bought by Orix Group from Japan. In August 2016, Rio Bravo's control was acquired by Fosun International, one of the largest private groups in China. Franco has been a member of several boards. He is now active as board member of Banco Daycoval, Seguradora Pottencial and as Chairman of Instituto Millenium, a Brazilian think tank.

He played the sadistic mountain man in John Boorman's 1972 film Deliverance and performed in seven Clint Eastwood films, most notably as Captain Terrill, commander pursuing the last rebels to \\"hold out\\" against surrendering to the Union forces in The Outlaw Josey Wales. Early life William Denison McKinney was born September 12, 1931, in Chattanooga, Tennessee. He had an unsettled life as a child, moving 12 times. At the age of 19, he joined the Navy during the Korean War. He served two years on a mine sweeper in Korean waters, and was stationed at Port Hueneme in Ventura County, California. While on leave, he visited Los Angeles and decided he wanted to become an actor. Upon his discharge in 1954, he settled in California, attending acting school at the famous Pasadena Playhouse in 1957. His classmates included Dustin Hoffman and Mako Iwamatsu. During this time, McKinney supported himself by working as an arborist, trimming and taking down trees. He continued working in this field until the mid-1970s, by which time he was appearing in major films. Career After the Pasadena Playhouse he moved onto Lee Strasberg's Actors Studio, making his movie debut in exploitation pic She Freak (1967). For 10 years he was a teacher at Cave Spring Middle School. He made his television debut in 1968 on an episode of The Monkees and attracted attention as Lobo in Alias Smith and Jones. The film Deliverance provided his breakthrough in 1972. He played villains in the 1970s with appearances in Junior Bonner, The Life and Times of Judge Roy Bean and The Parallax View. It was with Clint Eastwood that McKinney would become most associated, becoming part of Eastwood's stock company after they worked together in Michael Cimino's Thunderbolt and Lightfoot. He appeared in The Outlaw Josey Wales under Eastwood's direction. He appeared in six more Eastwood films including The Gauntlet, Every Which Way but Loose, Any Which Way You Can and Pink Cadillac. Other memorable roles include Jay Cobb, who is done in by John Wayne's The Shootist. He also appeared in such later films as First Blood, Back to the Future Part III and The Green Mile. He appeared in the TV movie The Execution of Private Slovik (1974) and guest-starred on such television shows as the 1976 western Sara, The Young Indiana Jones Chronicles, Starsky & Hutch, The A-Team, Hunter, Murder, She Wrote, Columbo: Swan Song and In The Heat of The Night. McKinney took up singing in the late 1990s, eventually releasing an album of standards and country and western songs appropriately titled Love Songs from Antri, reflecting Don Job's pronunciation of the infamous town featured in Deliverance. One of his songs featured in the film Undertow, directed by David Gordon Green. He voiced Jonah Hex in an episode of Batman: The Animated Series called \\"Showdown\\". In February 2010 he accepted a role in the Robin Hood‚Äìinspired horror film Sherwood Horror and had a cameo in 2001 Maniacs. Death On December 1, 2011, McKinney died from esophageal cancer at his home in San Fernando, California. He was 80. McKinney's death was announced on his Facebook page on the same day.

These three worlds are identified in Hinduism and appear in early Buddhist texts.  In Buddhist cosmology  In Buddhism, the three worlds refer to the following destinations for karmic rebirth: * KƒÅmaloka the world of desire, typified by base desires, populated by hell beings, preta, animals, ghosts, humans and lower demi-gods. * R≈´paloka is the world of form, predominately free of baser desires, populated by dhyƒÅna- dwelling gods, possible rebirth destination for those well practiced in dhyƒÅna. * Ar≈´paloka is the world of formlessness, a noncorporeal realm populated with four heavens, possible rebirth destination for practitioners of the four formlessness stages.  Theosophical views According to Helena Blavatsky's posthumously published Theosophical Glossary (1892): * Kamaloka (or kamadhatu) is the world of Mara. Kamaloka has, like every other world, its seven divisions, the lowest of which begins on earth or invisibly in its atmosphere; the six others ascend gradually, the highest being the abode of those who have died owing to accident, or suicide in a fit of temporary insanity, or were otherwise victims of external forces. It is a place where all those who have died before the end of the term allotted to them, and whose higher principles do not, therefore, go at once into Devachanic state‚Äîsleep a dreamless sweet sleep of oblivion, at the termination of which they are either reborn immediately, or pass gradually into the Devachanic state. * Rupaloka (or rupadhatu) is the celestial world of \\"form\\" (rupa), or what we call \\"Devachan.\\" With the uninitiated Brahmans, Chinese and other Buddhists, the Rupadhatu is divided into eighteen Brahma or Devalokas; the life of a soul therein lasts from half a Yuga up to 16,000 Yugas or Kalpas, and the height of the \\"Shades\\" is from half a Yojana up to 16,000 Yojanas (where a Yojana measures from five and a half to ten miles). Esoteric Philosophy teaches that though for the Egos for the time being, everything or everyone preserves its form (as in a dream), yet as Rupadhatu is a purely matter world, and a state, the Egos themselves have no form outside their own consciousness. Esotericism divides this world into seven Dhyanas, \\"regions\\", or states of contemplation, which are not localities but mental representations of these. * Arupaloka (or arupadhatu) is a world that is again divided into seven Dhyanas, still more abstract and formless, for this \\"World\\" is without any form or desire whatever. It is the highest world of the post-mortem Trailokya; and as it is the abode of those who are almost ready for Nirvana, and is, in fact, the very threshold of the Nirvanic state, it stands to reason that in Anupadhatu (or Arupavachara) there can be neither form nor sensation, nor any feeling connected with our three-dimensional Universe.

Composition and premiere With Ph√®dre, Racine chose once more a subject from Greek mythology, already treated by Greek and Roman tragic poets, notably by Euripides in Hippolytus and Seneca in Phaedra. As a result of an intrigue by the Duchess of Bouillon and other friends of the aging Pierre Corneille, the play was not a success at its premi√®re on 1 January 1677 at the H√¥tel de Bourgogne, home of the royal troupe of actors in Paris. Indeed, a rival group staged a play by the now forgotten playwright Nicolas Pradon on an almost identical theme. After Ph√®dre, Racine ceased writing plays on secular themes and devoted himself to the service of religion and the king until 1689, when he was commissioned to write Esther by Madame de Maintenon, the morganatic second wife of Louis XIV.From Racine's Masterpiece, Ph√®dre of Encyclopedia of World Biography on Jean Baptiste Racine Characters Phaedra and Hippolytus, c. 290 AD Names of characters in French, with their equivalents in English: * Th√©s√©e, or Theseus, King of Athens * Ph√®dre, or Phaedra, wife of Th√©s√©e, daughter of Minos and Pasipha√´ and sister of Ariadne * Hippolyte, or Hippolytus, son of Th√©s√©e and Antiope, Queen of the Amazons * Aricie, or Aricia, princess of the royal blood of Athens * ≈ínone, or Oenone, nurse and confidante of Ph√®dre * Th√©ram√®ne, or Theramenes, tutor of Hippolyte * Ism√®ne, confidante of Aricie * Panope, lady- in-waiting to Ph√®dre Synopsis The play is set at the royal court in Troezen, on the Peloponnesus coast in Southern Greece. In the absence of her royal husband Th√©s√©e, Ph√®dre ends by declaring her love to Hippolyte, Th√©s√©e's son from a previous marriage. Ph√®dre and Th√©s√©e (1923), L√©on Bakst Act 1. Following Theseus's six-month absence, his son Hippolytus tells his tutor Theramenes of his intention to leave Troezen in search of his father. When pressed by Theramenes, he reveals that the real motive is his forbidden love for Aricia, sole survivor of the royal house supplanted by Theseus and under a vow of chastity against her will. During her husband's absence, Ph√®dre has become consumed by an illicit but overpowering passion for her stepson Hippolytus, which she has kept as a dark secret. Close to death and reeling about half-dementedly, under pressure from her old nurse Oenone she explains her state, on condition that she be permitted to die rather than face dishonour. The death of Theseus is announced with the news that his succession is in dispute. Oenone urges her mistress that, since her love for her stepson is now legitimate, she should form an alliance with him, if only for the future benefit of the infant son of her own flesh. Act 2. With fresh hope for her liberty, Aricia reveals to her maidservant Ism√®ne her feelings towards Hippolytus, who promptly appears to declare his love for her. Their discourse is interrupted by Ph√®dre, who distraughtly pleads for the rights of her infant son, explaining her coldness and personal despair. Suddenly entering a trance- like state overcome by emotion, she involuntarily confesses her hidden passions to her horrified dumb-struck stepson. Sensing rejection, she leaves in a wild frenzy, demanding Hippolytus' sword to end her torment. Theramenes brings news to Hippolytus that Theseus might still be alive. Act 3. In desperation Ph√®dre sends word to Hippolytus inviting him to share the crown of Athens. However, Oenone brings her the devastating news that Theseus has returned in perfect health. To avert Ph√®dre's deathwish and her possible betrayal by Hippolytus, Oenone urges that a story should be concocted around his abandoned sword. Seeing Hippolytus by Theseus' side, Ph√®dre grants Oenone free rein. After his long period in captivity, Theseus is surprised by the cold reception from his wife and son, each anxious to conceal their passions: Ph√®dre, consumed by guilt; and Hippolytus, anxious to distance himself from his stepmother's advances, but unable to tell his father of his love for Aricia. Act 4. Theseus has just been told by Oenone that Hippolytus has attempted to take Ph√®dre by force. Overcome by rage, Theseus banishes Hippolytus and invokes the god Neptune, who has promised to grant any wish of Theseus, to avenge him by his son's death. Protesting his innocence, Hippolytus discloses his secret love for Aricia to his incredulous father and leaves in despair. Fearing that she might be guilty for Hippolytus' death, Ph√®dre determines to reveal the truth to her husband, until she is told of Hippolytus' love for Aricia. Consumed by jealousy, she refuses to defend Hippolytus further, leaving his father's curse to run its course. When Oenone tries to make light of her mistress's illicit love, Ph√®dre in a towering rage accuses her of being a poisonous scheming monster and banishes her from her presence. Act 5. Hippolytus takes his leave of Aricia, promising to marry her in a temple outside Troezen. On witnessing the tenderness of their parting, Theseus begins to have doubts about his son's guilt. He decides to question Oenone, but it is too late: Oenone has thrown herself to the waves. Theramenes brings news of his son's death: Hippolytus' departing chariot has been interrupted by a terrifying horned monster rising from the waves; mortally wounded by Hippolytus, its death throes drive his horses into a wild frenzy; in their flight, the chariot is dashed against the rocks and their master dragged helplessly to his death. In the closing scene, Ph√®dre, now calm, appears before Theseus to confess her guilt and to confirm Hippolytus's innocence. She finally succumbs to the effects of a self-administered draught of Medean poison, taken to rid the world of her impurity. As an act of atonement and in respect for his son's parting promise, Theseus pardons Aricia and adopts her as his daughter. Ph√®dre's ancestry and its curse The genealogy of Ph√®dre gives a number of indications as to her character's destiny. Descended from Helios, god of the Sun, and Pasipha√´, she nevertheless avoids being in the judgmental presence of the sun throughout the play. The simultaneous absence of a god-figure combined with the continual presence of one has been extensively explored in Lucien Goldmann's Le Dieu cach√©. This sense of patriarchal judgment is extended to Ph√®dre's father, Minos, who is responsible for weighing the souls of the dead upon their arrival in Hades. Ph√®dre is right to fear judgment; she is driven to an incestual love for her stepson Hippolytus, much like the other women in her family, who tended to experience desires generally considered taboo. Her mother, Pasipha√´ was cursed by Aphrodite to fall in love and mate with a white bull, giving rise to the legendary Minotaur. Ph√®dre meets Theseus, her future husband, when he arrives on the Minoan scene to kill her monstrous half-brother, the minotaur. Reception Ph√®dre has been widely regarded as masterly, due to its tragic construction, deeply observed characters, richness of the verse, as well as the interpretation of the title role by Marie Champmesl√©. Voltaire called it \\"the masterpiece of the human mind.\\" Contrary to Euripides, Racine has Ph√®dre die on stage at the end of the play; she thus has had time to learn of the death of Hippolyte. The character of Ph√®dre is considered one of the most remarkable in Racine's tragic oeuvre. The instrument of others' suffering, she is also the victim of her own impulses, a figure that inspires both terror and pity. Certain lines from the play, such as \\"la fille de Minos et de Pasipha√©\\", have become classics in the French language; but despite the celebrated musicality of the alexandrine, Racine never wrote poetry just for the sake of beauty of sound. In the character of Ph√®dre, he could combine the consuming desire inherited from her mother with the mortal fear of her father, Minos, judge of the dead in Hades. Despite its author's silence from 1677 to 1689, as time progressed Ph√®dre became one of the most famous of his plays. It is now one of the most frequently staged tragedies from the seventeenth century. In his work Le Dieu cach√©, the 20th century author Lucien Goldmann extrapolates social theories of the role of the divine in French consciousness from thematic elements in Ph√®dre. Although Ph√®dre is perhaps less often studied at high school level in France than Britannicus or Andromaque, it is still frequently performed, and the eponymous role has been played by actresses such as Sarah Bernhardt and Isabelle Huppert. Adaptations =Stage= Ph√®dre (1880), Alexandre Cabanel The French baroque composer Jean-Philippe Rameau's first opera Hippolyte et Aricie (1733) was based on Racine's Ph√®dre as was Simon Mayr's 1820 opera Fedra. The British poet laureate Ted Hughes produced a highly regarded free verse translation of Ph√®dre. This version was staged shortly before his death with Diana Rigg playing the title role. Another English production of the Hughes translation premiered at the Royal National Theatre in June 2009, with a cast including Helen Mirren as Ph√®dre, Dominic Cooper as Hippolytus, and Margaret Tyzack as Oenone. This production was digitally telecast live to cinemas around the world. A new translation by Timberlake Wertenbaker premiered at the Stratford Shakespeare Festival in Autumn 2009. The Polish composer Krzysztof Penderecki announced that he is working on an opera of Ph√®dre for 2014.\\"A composer for all seasons\\", The Irish Times (9 September 2010) =Novels= In the nineteenth century, √âmile Zola loosely based La Cur√©e, one of his books from the Rougon-Macquart series (an exploration of genealogical and environmental influences upon characters) on Racine's Ph√®dre. Marcel Proust devotes 20 pages of In the Shadow of Young Girls in Flower to his experience of Ph√®dre at the Op√©ra-Comique in Paris. =Translations and editions= Robert Lowell's English translation Phaedra was published in 1961. Ph√®dre was translated by Scottish poet Edwin Morgan (1920‚Äì2010) into Scots in 2000, and won the 2001 Oxford-Weidenfeld Translation Prize. (English translation by J.

D. (December 5, 1922 ‚Äì March 13, 2009) was an American businessman. He was President, Chairman and CEO of Guardian Industries, one of the world's largest manufacturers of architectural and automotive glass. He was also owner of several North American professional sports teams and a member of the Naismith Memorial Basketball Hall of Fame. He was also the chairman of Palace Sports and Entertainment, and principal owner of the Detroit Pistons of the NBA, the Detroit Shock of the WNBA, the co-owner of the Detroit Fury of the Arena Football League, and the former owner of the Tampa Bay Lightning of the NHL and Detroit Vipers of the IHL. His Pistons won the 1989, 1990, and 2004 NBA Finals; his Shock won the 2003, 2006 and 2008 WNBA Finals; his Vipers won the 1997 Turner Cup; Tampa Bay Lightning won the 2004 Stanley Cup, making him the only owner in professional sports history whose teams have won an NBA Championship and a Stanley Cup in the same year. Early life and education A Detroit native, Davidson was born to a Jewish family on December 5, 1922; he was a 1940 graduate of Central High School.\\"American Jewish businessman donates $75 million to Jerusalem hospital\\" - Israel News, Ynetnews Davidson entered the University of Michigan in 1940, where he was a member of the track and field team; he majored in business at what is now the Ross School of Business. Davidson later joined the U.S. Navy and played Armed Forces Football during World War II. Following the war, Davidson garnered his law degree from Wayne State University Law School in 1949. After three years of law practice, he rescued a wholesale drug company and a surgical supply company from bankruptcy. Career =Early career and family business= Davidson would also take over his family's Guardian Glass Co. in 1957, the same year the company declared bankruptcy. Guardian Glass would be the precursor to his company Guardian Industries, one of the largest glass suppliers in the world. Davidson encouraged risk-taking, discouraged second-guessing and was seen as aggressive. Not without controversy, Guardian was sued at least six times between 1965 and 1988. In 1989, Guardian was ordered to pay its competitor Johns Manville $38 million for stealing fibreglass-making technology. Guardian now stands as one of the world's giants of glass manufacturing with facilities in Asia, Europe, Africa and South America in addition to its sprawling North American interests. =Pistons ownership= Being acquainted with football, Davidson wanted to acquire a football franchise. In 1974, Davidson and college classmate Oscar Feldman enlisted ex-Detroit Lions great Joe Schmidt to be part of a group bidding on the Tampa expansion franchise. The expansion fee soon grew too high for the group's liking, and it bowed out of the bidding. Two months later, Davidson learned that Pistons owner Fred Zollner was thinking of putting the team up for sale. Zollner had founded the Pistons in Fort Wayne, Indiana in 1941 and moved them to Detroit in 1957. However, the Pistons had never turned a profit since the move to Detroit. Davidson and Zollner had known each other for some time, since they both had vacation homes in Golden Beach, Florida. Zollner quickly reached a deal to sell the Pistons to Davidson for $6 million, which closed in late 1974. At the time, the Pistons played at 10,000-seat Cobo Arena in downtown Detroit. Davidson was displeased with this location, but opted not to join the Detroit Red Wings at the under-construction Joe Louis Arena. Instead, he relocated the team to the Pontiac Silverdome in 1978 and then to The Palace of Auburn Hills, the first NBA arena financed entirely with private funds, in 1988. To help pay the $90 million construction cost, the Bob Sosnick-designed arena featured lower-level suites, then a never-seen-before feature. His Pistons were at the league's forefront with respect to amenities. The franchise has a state-of-the-art practice facility, solely designed for the Pistons. During the offseason, team members are able to use the facilities while working on personal off-season conditioning goals. Against the advice of friends, Davidson was also the first owner to buy an airplane for his team, nicknamed Roundball One. Roundball Two, a newer, larger, multimillion-dollar aircraft refurbished with 42 luxury seats and a state-of-the-art video system, was purchased in the summer of 1998. Davidson was also the first to encourage globalizing the marketing of the NBA. He has served as Chairman of the Board of Governors and was active on several committees, including the one that selected former NBA Commissioner Larry O'Brien in 1975. In 2009, the value of the Pistons franchise was estimated to be over $430 million. Regularly seen at the team's home games, Davidson had said repeatedly that he would never sell the Pistons and the franchise would remain in his family after he died. In 1999, Davidson put in an unsuccessful bid to purchase the Tampa Bay Lightning and gain a controlling interest in their home arena, the Ice Palace. He lost to insurance tycoon Art Williams, but only months later Williams sold the team to Davidson and Palace Sports at a huge loss. When Davidson acquired the Lightning franchise in 1999, the price was $100 million; its value has recently been estimated at $136 million. Tampa Bay won the Stanley Cup under Davidson's ownership in 2004. On August 7, 2007 Davidson sold the Lightning franchise. Davidson was honored by the Pistons in 2006 when he was given a banner next to the team's retired numbers. His name (as \\"Bill Davidson\\") was also placed on the Palace floor along with Pistons legends Dave Bing, Bill Laimbeer, Vinnie Johnson, Chuck Daly, Joe Dumars, Isiah Thomas and Bob Lanier. In 2008, Davidson was elected to the Naismith Memorial Basketball Hall of Fame as a contributor for his successes as an owner of the Pistons and Shock.Naismith Hall of Fame 2008 Class Announced He was also an inaugural inductee into the Jewish Sports Hall of Fame. At the time of his death, Davidson lived in Bloomfield Hills, Michigan with his wife, Karen. He had two children, Ethan and Marla, and three stepdaughters, including actress Elizabeth Reaser. His combined business ventures led him to an estimated net worth of $3.5 billion, which led to Forbes ranking him as the 68th richest man in the United States. Philanthropic activities A noted philanthropist, Davidson gave extensively to various organizations. He was one of the founders of the Pistons/Palace Foundation, a charity that has donated more than $20 million in cash and merchandise since 1989. In 1995, the foundation partnered with the City of Detroit's Parks and Recreation Department to establish the Partnership to Adopt and Renovate Parks for Kids (PARK) Program, which provided restoration of Detroit parks, basketball courts, baseball diamonds, running tracks and playground equipment. In 1992, the William Davidson Institute at the University of Michigan was created at Davidson's alma mater, the Ross School of Business. A gift of $30 million was given to provide assistance in a special program to help develop market economies throughout the world. In total, Davidson's gifts to the school exceed $55 million. In 1997, the Council of Michigan Foundations honored Davidson for his lifelong philanthropic efforts locally, nationally and internationally. He was listed as one of America's most generous donors in a New York Times article that same year. Davidson enabled the Detroit Symphony Orchestra to make long-term touring plans both in the U.S. and internationally with a renewable $2 million donation. He pledged to fight cancer with a gift of $1 million to support collaborative research, prevention and early detection programs in breast and pediatric cancers at the Karmanos Cancer Institute and Children's Research Center of Michigan. After the Yom Kippur war, he and fellow Detroit-area philanthropist Lloyd J. Paul were flown to Israel by Prime Minister Golda Meir and given the Prime Minister's Club Award for outstanding philanthropic deeds towards Israel. In 1999, Davidson gave $20 million to establish the Davidson Institute of Science Education at the Weizmann Institute of Science in Rehovot, Israel. This was then the largest private donation ever given to the institute, a leading international science research center and graduate school. Davidson later added another gift of $15 million to the same institute. In addition, he endowed the William Davidson Graduate School of Jewish Education at the Jewish Theological Seminary of America in New York with a $15 million gift. The excavations on the southern wall of the Temple Mount in Jerusalem have been named the Davidson excavations in tribute to his generous donations to the project. He also gave to the American Technion Society to establish the world's first educational institution entirely dedicated to the international management of technology-based companies at the Technion - Israel Institute of Technology. Davidson was also a contributor to the Wexner Foundation which gives grants to graduate students of Jewish studies. In March 2007, Davidson donated $75 million to the Hadassah Ein Kerem Hospital in Jerusalem. Awards and recognition Davidson was decorated as Commander of the Order of the Oak Crown and as Grand Officer of the Order of Merit of the Grand Duchy of Luxembourg Personal life Davidson was married four times.The Jewish News: \\"Bill's Dreams Live On\\" October 11, 2012 He had two children:Detroit free Press: \\"Davidson estate settles in lawsuits\\" by John Gallagher August 31, 2010NBA Information: \\"Estate of Pistons owner mired in legal battles\\" Wednesday, January 20, 2010 *Ethan Daniel Davidson, a musician, who is married to fellow musician Gretchen Gonzales.Hour Detroit - \\"CD Review: Ethan Daniel Davidson's 'Silvertooth' - After a seven-year hush, Davidson is back with a new solo record\\" By Mark Kurlyandchik September 2012 He is active with the William Davidson Foundation.Detroit Free press: \\"Refusing to live in Bill Davidson's shadow, son ready to fulfill his legacy of giving\\" by Bill McCullum September 16, 2012 *Marla Davidson Karimipour, married to Cyrus Karimipour.

Kong has been dubbed the Eighth Wonder of the World, a phrase commonly used within the films. The character first appeared in the novelization of the 1933 film King Kong from RKO Pictures, with the film premiering a little over two months later. The film received universal acclaim upon its initial release and re-releases. A sequel quickly followed that same year with The Son of Kong, featuring Little Kong. In the 1960s, Toho produced King Kong vs. Godzilla (1962), pitting a larger Kong against Toho's own Godzilla, and King Kong Escapes (1967), based on The King Kong Show (1966‚Äì1969) from Rankin/Bass Productions. In 1976, Dino De Laurentiis produced a modern remake of the original film directed by John Guillermin. A sequel, King Kong Lives, followed a decade later featuring a Lady Kong. Another remake of the original, this time set in 1933, was released in 2005 from filmmaker Peter Jackson. The most recent film, Kong: Skull Island (2017), set in 1973, is part of Legendary Entertainment's MonsterVerse, which began with Legendary's reboot of Godzilla in 2014. A crossover sequel, Godzilla vs. Kong, once again pitting the characters against one another, is currently planned for 2021. The character of King Kong has become one of the world's most famous movie icons, having inspired a number of sequels, remakes, spin-offs, imitators, parodies, cartoons, books, comics, video games, theme park rides, and a stage play. His role in the different narratives varies, ranging from a rampaging monster to a tragic antihero. Overview King Kong graphics at Empire State Building. The King Kong character was conceived and created by American filmmaker Merian C. Cooper. In the original film, the character's name is Kong, a name given to him by the inhabitants of the fictional \\"Skull Island\\" in the Indian Ocean, where Kong lives along with other oversized animals, such as plesiosaurs, pterosaurs and various dinosaurs. An American film crew, led by Carl Denham, captures Kong and takes him to New York City to be exhibited as the \\"Eighth Wonder of the World\\". Kong escapes and climbs the Empire State Building, only to fall from the skyscraper after being attacked by airplanes with guns. Denham comments \\"it wasn't the airplanes, It was beauty killed the beast\\", for he climbs the building in the first place only in an attempt to protect Ann Darrow, an actress originally kidnapped by the natives of the island and offered up to Kong as a sacrifice (in the 1976 remake, her character is named \\"Dwan\\"). A pseudo-documentary about Skull Island that appears on the DVD for the 2005 remake (originally seen on the Sci-Fi Channel at the time of its theatrical release) gives Kong's scientific name as Megaprimatus kongThe World of Kong: A Natural History of Skull Island, p. 210 (\\"Megaprimatus\\", deriving from the prefix \\"mega-\\" and the Latin words \\"primate\\" and \\"primatus\\", means \\"big primate\\" or \\"big supreme being\\") and states that his species may be related to Gigantopithecus, though that genus of giant ape is more closely related to orangutans than to gorillas. =Conception and creation= Merian C. Cooper glances up at his creation. Merian C. Cooper became fascinated by gorillas at the age of 6. In 1899, he was given a book from his uncle called Explorations and Adventures in Equatorial Africa. The book (written in 1861), chronicled the adventures of Paul Du Chaillu in Africa and his various encounters with the natives and wildlife there. Cooper became fascinated with the stories involving the gorillas, in particular, Du Chaillu's depiction of a particular gorilla known for its \\"extraordinary size\\", that the natives described as \\"invincible\\" and the \\"King of the African Forest\\". When Du Chaillu and some natives encountered a gorilla later in the book he described it as a \\"hellish dream creature\\" that was \\"half man, half beast\\". As an adult, Cooper became involved in the motion picture industry. While filming The Four Feathers in Africa, he came into contact with a family of baboons. This gave him the idea to make a picture about primates. A year later when he got to RKO, Cooper wanted to film a \\"terror gorilla picture\\". As the story was being fleshed out, Cooper decided to make his gorilla giant sized. Cooper stated that the idea of Kong fighting warplanes on top of a building came from him seeing a plane flying over the New York Insurance Building, then the tallest building in the world. He came up with the ending before the rest of the story as he stated, \\"Without any conscious effort of thought I immediately saw in my mind's eye a giant gorilla on top of the building\\". Cooper also was influenced by Douglas Burden's accounts of the Komodo dragon, and wanted to pit his terror gorilla against dinosaur-sized versions of these reptiles, stating to Burden, \\"I also had firmly in mind to giantize both the gorilla and your dragons to make them really huge. However I always believed in personalizing and focusing attention on one main character and from the very beginning I intended to make it the gigantic gorilla, no matter what else I surrounded him with\\". Around this time, Cooper began to refer to his project as a \\"giant terror gorilla picture\\" featuring \\"a gigantic semi-humanoid gorilla pitted against modern civilization\\". When designing King Kong, Cooper wanted him to be a nightmarish gorilla monster. As he described Kong in a 1930 memo, \\"His hands and feet have the size and strength of steam shovels; his girth is that of a steam boiler. This is a monster with the strength of a hundred men. But more terrifying is the head‚Äîa nightmare head with bloodshot eyes and jagged teeth set under a thick mat of hair, a face half-beast half-human\\". Willis O'Brien created an oil painting depicting the giant gorilla menacing a jungle heroine and hunter for Cooper.Willis O'Brien giant gorilla painting\\"Willis O'Brien-Creator of the Impossible\\" by Don Shay, Cinefex #7, R. B. Graphics, 1982, pg. 33 However, when it came time for O'Brien and Marcel Delgado to sculpt the animation model, Cooper decided to backpedal on the half-human look for the creature and became adamant that Kong be a gorilla. O'Brien on the other hand, wanted him to be almost human-like to gain audience empathy, and told Delgado to \\"make that ape almost human\\". Cooper laughed at the end result, saying that it looked like a cross between a monkey and a man with very long hair. For the second model, O'Brien again asked Delgado to add human features but to tone it down somewhat. The end result (which was rejected) was described as looking like a missing link. Disappointed, Cooper stated, \\"I want Kong to be the fiercest, most brutal, monstrous damned thing that has ever been seen!\\" On December 22, 1931, Cooper got the dimensions of a bull gorilla from the American Museum of Natural History telling O'Brien, \\"Now that's what I want!\\" When the final model was created, it had the basic look of a gorilla but managed to retain some human-like qualities. For example, Delgado streamlined the body by removing the distinctive paunch and rump of a gorilla. O'Brien would incorporate some characteristics and nuances of an earlier creature he had created in 1915 for the silent short The Dinosaur and the Missing Link into the general look and personality of Kong, even going as far as to refer to the creature as \\"Kong's ancestor\\".Paul A. Woods, King Kong Cometh!, Plexus Publishing Limited, 2005, pg. 27 When it came time to film, Cooper agreed that Kong should walk upright at times (mostly in the New York sequences) in order to appear more intimidating. =Origin of the name= Merian C. Cooper was very fond of strong, hard-sounding words that started with the letter \\"K\\". Some of his favorite words were \\"Komodo\\", \\"Kodiak\\" and \\"Kodak\\". When Cooper was envisioning his giant terror gorilla idea, he wanted to capture a real gorilla from the Congo and have it fight a real Komodo dragon on Komodo Island (this scenario would eventually evolve into Kong's battle with the tyrannosaur on Skull Island when the film was produced a few years later at RKO). Cooper's friend Douglas Burden's trip to the island of Komodo and his encounter with the Komodo dragons was a big influence on the Kong story. Cooper was fascinated by Burden's adventures as chronicled in his book Dragon Lizards of Komodo where he referred to the animal as the \\"King of Komodo\\". It was this phrase along with \\"Komodo\\" and \\"Kongo\\" (and his overall love for hard sounding \\"K\\"-words) that gave him the idea to name the giant ape \\"Kong\\". He loved the name, as it had a \\"mystery sound\\" to it. After Cooper got to RKO, British mystery writer Edgar Wallace was contracted to write the first draft of the screen story. It was simply referred to as \\"The Beast\\". RKO executives were unimpressed with the bland title. David O. Selznick suggested Jungle Beast as the film's new title, but Cooper was unimpressed and wanted to name the film after the main character. He stated he liked the \\"mystery word\\" aspect of Kong's name and that the film should carry \\"the name of the leading mysterious, romantic, savage creature of the story\\" such as with Dracula and Frankenstein. RKO sent a memo to Cooper suggesting the titles Kong: King of Beasts, Kong: The Jungle King, and Kong: The Jungle Beast, which combined his and Selznick's proposed titles. As time went on, Cooper would eventually name the story simply Kong while Ruth Rose was writing the final version of the screenplay. Because David O. Selznick thought that audiences would think that the film, with the one word title of Kong, would be mistaken as a docudrama like Grass and Chang, which were one-word titled films that Cooper had earlier produced, he added the \\"King\\" to Kong's name in order to differentiate it. =Appearances and abilities= In his first appearance in King Kong (1933), Kong was a gigantic prehistoric ape, or as RKO's publicity materials described him, \\"A prehistoric type of ape\\". While gorilla-like in appearance, he had a vaguely humanoid look and at times walked upright in an anthropomorphic manner. Indeed, Carl Denham describes him as being \\"neither beast nor man\\". Like most simians, Kong possesses semi-human intelligence and great physical strength. Kong's size changes drastically throughout the course of the film. While creator Merian C. Cooper envisioned Kong as being \\"40 to 50 feet tall\\", animator Willis O'Brien and his crew built the models and sets scaling Kong to be only tall on Skull Island, and rescaled to be tall in New York. This did not stop Cooper from playing around with Kong's size as he directed the special effect sequences; by manipulating the sizes of the miniatures and the camera angles, he made Kong appear a lot larger than O'Brien wanted, even as large as in some scenes. As Cooper stated in an interview: Concurrently, the Kong bust made for the film was built in scale with a ape, while the full sized hand of Kong was built in scale with a ape.Karen Haber, Kong Unbound, Pocket Books, 2005, pg. 106 Meanwhile, RKO's promotional materials listed Kong's official height as . In the 1960s, Toho Studios from Japan licensed the character for the films King Kong vs. Godzilla and King Kong Escapes. For more details on these versions of the character, see below. In 1975, Italian producer Dino De Laurentiis paid RKO for the remake rights to King Kong. This resulted in King Kong (1976). This Kong was an upright walking anthropomorphic ape, appearing even more human-like than the original. Also like the original, this Kong had semi-human intelligence and vast strength. In the 1976 film, Kong was scaled to be tall on Skull island and rescaled to be tall in New York. Ten years later, Dino De Laurentiis got the approval from Universal to do a sequel called King Kong Lives. This Kong had more or less the same appearance and abilities, but tended to walk on his knuckles more often and was enlarged, scaled to . Universal Studios had planned to do a King Kong remake as far back as 1976. They finally followed through almost 30 years later, with a three-hour film directed by Peter Jackson. Jackson opted to make Kong a gigantic silverback gorilla without any anthropomorphic features. This Kong looked and behaved more like a real gorilla: he had a large herbivore's belly, walked on his knuckles without any upright posture, and even beat his chest with his palms as opposed to clenched fists. In order to ground his Kong in realism, Jackson and the Weta Digital crew gave a name to his fictitious species Megaprimatus kong and suggested it to have evolved from the Gigantopithecus. Kong was the last of his kind. He was portrayed in the film as being quite old, with graying fur and battle-worn with scars, wounds, and a crooked jaw from his many fights against rival creatures. He is the dominant being on the island, the king of his world. But, like his film predecessors, he possesses considerable intelligence and great physical strength; he also appears far more nimble and agile. This Kong was scaled to a consistent height of tall on both Skull Island and in New York.Weta Workshop, The World of Kong: A Natural History of Skull Island, Pocket Books, 2005 Jackson describes his central character: In the 2017 film Kong: Skull Island, Kong is scaled to be tall, making it the second biggest incarnation in the series.Kong-Sized Director Jordan Vogt-Roberts stated in regard to Kong's immense stature: He also stated that the original 1933 look was the inspiration for the design, saying: Co-producer Mary Parent also stated that Kong is still young and not fully grown as she explains, \\"Kong is an adolescent when we meet him in the film; he's still growing into his role as alpha\\". =Legal rights= While one of the most famous movie icons in history, King Kong's intellectual property status has been questioned since his creation, featuring in numerous allegations and court battles. The rights to the character have always been split up with no single exclusive rights holder. Different parties have also contested that various aspects are public domain material and therefore ineligible for copyright status. When Merian C. Cooper created King Kong, he assumed that he owned the character, which he had conceived in 1929, outright. Cooper maintained that he had only licensed the character to RKO for the initial film and sequel, but had otherwise owned his own creation. In 1935, Cooper began to feel something was amiss when he was trying to get a Tarzan vs. King Kong project off the ground for Pioneer Pictures (where he had assumed management of the company). After David O. Selznick suggested the project to Cooper, the flurry of legal activity over using the Kong character that followed‚ÄîPioneer had become a completely independent company by this time and access to properties that RKO felt were theirs was no longer automatic‚Äîgave Cooper pause as he came to realize that he might not have full control over this product of his own imagination after all. Years later in 1962, Cooper found out that RKO was licensing the character through John Beck to Toho studios in Japan for a film project called King Kong vs. Godzilla. Cooper had assumed his rights were unassailable and was bitterly opposed to the project. In 1963 he filed a lawsuit to enjoin distribution of the movie against John Beck, as well as Toho and Universal (the film's U.S. copyright holder). Cooper discovered that RKO had also profited from licensed products featuring the King Kong character such as model kits produced by Aurora Plastics Corporation. Cooper's executive assistant, Charles B. FitzSimons, stated that these companies should be negotiating through him and Cooper for such licensed products and not RKO. In a letter to Robert Bendick, Cooper stated: Cooper and his legal team offered up various documents to bolster the case that Cooper owned King Kong and had only licensed the character to RKO for two films, rather than selling him outright. Many people vouched for Cooper's claims, including David O. Selznick, who had written a letter to Mr. A. Loewenthal of the Famous Artists Syndicate in Chicago in 1932 stating (in regard to Kong), \\"The rights of this are owned by Mr. Merian C. Cooper.\\" But Cooper had lost key documents through the years (he discovered these papers were missing after he returned from his World War II military service) such as a key informal yet binding letter from Mr. Ayelsworth (the then-president of the RKO Studio Corp.) and a formal binding letter from Mr. B. B. Kahane (the current president of RKO Studio Corp.) confirming that Cooper had only licensed the rights to the character for the two RKO pictures and nothing more. Without these letters, it seemed Cooper's rights were relegated to the Lovelace novelization that he had copyrighted (he was able to make a deal for a Bantam Books paperback reprint and a Gold Key comic adaptation of the novel, but that was all that he could do). Cooper's lawyer had received a letter from John Beck's lawyer, Gordon E. Youngman, that stated: In a letter addressed to Douglas Burden, Cooper lamented: The rights over the character did not flare up again until 1975, when Universal Studios and Dino De Laurentiis were fighting over who would be able to do a King Kong remake for release the following year. De Laurentiis came up with $200,000 to buy the remake rights from RKO. When Universal got wind of this, they filed a lawsuit against RKO, claiming that they had a verbal agreement from them regarding the remake. During the legal battles that followed, which eventually included RKO countersuing Universal, as well as De Laurentiis filing a lawsuit claiming interference, Colonel Richard Cooper (Merian's son and now head of the Cooper estate) jumped into the fray. During the battles, Universal discovered that the copyright of the Lovelace novelization had expired without renewal, thus making the King Kong story a public domain one. Universal argued that they should be able to make a movie based on the novel without infringing on anyone's copyright because the characters in the story were in the public domain within the context of the public domain story. Richard Cooper then filed a cross-claim against RKO claiming that, while the publishing rights to the novel had not been renewed, his estate still had control over the plot/story of King Kong. In a four-day bench trial in Los Angeles, Judge Manuel Real made the final decision and gave his verdict on November 24, 1976, affirming that the King Kong novelization and serialization were indeed in the public domain, and Universal could make its movie as long as it did not infringe on original elements in the 1933 RKO film, which had not passed into the public domainUniversal City Studios, Inc. v. Nintendo Co., Ltd. 55 USLW 2152 797 F.2d 70; 230 U.S.P.Q. 409, (2nd Cir., July 15, 1986). (Universal postponed their plans to film a King Kong movie, called The Legend of King Kong, for at least 18 months, after cutting a deal with Dino De Laurentiis that included a percentage of box office profits from his remake). However, on December 6, 1976, Judge Real made a subsequent ruling, which held that all the rights in the name, character, and story of King Kong (outside of the original film and its sequel) belonged to Merian C. Cooper's estate. This ruling, which became known as the \\"Cooper judgment\\", expressly stated that it would not change the previous ruling that publishing rights of the novel and serialization were in the public domain. It was a huge victory that affirmed the position Merian C. Cooper had maintained for years. Shortly thereafter, Richard Cooper sold all his rights (excluding worldwide book and periodical publishing rights) to Universal in December 1976. In 1980 Judge Real dismissed the claims that were brought forth by RKO and Universal four years earlier and reinstated the Cooper judgement. In 1982 Universal filed a lawsuit against Nintendo, which had created an impish ape character called Donkey Kong in 1981 and was reaping huge profits over the video game machines. Universal claimed that Nintendo was infringing on its copyright because Donkey Kong was a blatant rip-off of King Kong. During the court battle and subsequent appeal, the courts ruled that Universal did not have exclusive trademark rights to the King Kong character. The courts ruled that trademark was not among the rights Cooper had sold to Universal, indicating that \\"Cooper plainly did not obtain any trademark rights in his judgment against RKO, since the California district court specifically found that King Kong had no secondary meaning.\\" While they had a majority of the rights, they did not outright own the King Kong name and character. The courts ruling noted that the name, title, and character of Kong no longer signified a single source of origin so exclusive trademark rights were impossible. The courts also pointed out that the Kong rights were held by three parties: * RKO owned the rights to the original film and its sequel. * The Dino De Laurentiis company (DDL) owned the rights to the 1976 remake. * Richard Cooper owned worldwide book and periodical publishing rights. The judge then ruled that \\"Universal thus owns only those rights in the King Kong name and character that RKO, Cooper, or DDL do not own.\\"According to Mark Cotta Vaz's book on p. 389, and citation 9 on p. 458, this quote is taken from a court summary from the document Universal City Studios, Inc. v. Nintendo Co., Ltd., 578 F. Supp. at 924. The court of appeals would also note: Because Universal misrepresented their degree of ownership of King Kong (claiming they had exclusive trademark rights when they knew that they did not) and tried to have it both ways in court regarding the \\"public domain\\" claims, the courts ruled that Universal acted in bad faith (see Universal City Studios, Inc. v. Nintendo Co., Ltd.). They were ordered to pay fines and all of Nintendo's legal costs from the lawsuit. That, along with the fact that the courts ruled that there was simply no likelihood of people confusing Donkey Kong with King Kong, caused Universal to lose the case and the subsequent appeal. Since the court case, Universal still retains the majority of the character rights. In 1986 they opened a King Kong ride called King Kong Encounter at their Universal Studios Tour theme park in Hollywood (which was destroyed in 2008 by a backlot fire), and followed it up with the Kongfrontation ride at their Orlando park in 1990 (which was closed down in 2002 due to maintenance issues). They also finally made a King Kong film of their own, King Kong (2005). In the summer of 2010, Universal opened a new 3D King Kong ride called King Kong: 360 3-D at their Hollywood park, replacing the destroyed King Kong Encounter. On July 13, 2016, Universal opened a new King Kong attraction called Skull Island: Reign of Kong at Islands of Adventure in Orlando. In July 2013, Legendary Pictures reached an agreement with Universal in which it will market, co-finance, and distribute Legendary's films for five years starting in 2014, the year that Legendary's similar agreement with Warner Bros. was set to expire. Later, in July 2014 at the San Diego Comic-Con, Legendary announced (as a product of its partnership with Universal), a King Kong origin story, initially titled Skull Island, with Universal distributing. On December 12, 2014, the studio announced they had re-titled the film Kong: Skull Island. On September 10, 2015, it was announced that Universal would let Legendary Pictures move Kong: Skull Island to Warner Bros., so they could do a King Kong and Godzilla crossover film (in the continuity of the 2014 Godzilla movie), since Legendary Pictures still had the rights to do the two Godzilla sequels with Warner Bros. As noted above, Richard Cooper, through the Merian C. Cooper Estate, retained publishing rights for the content that Judge Real had ruled on December 6, 1976, belonged to Richard Cooper. In 1990, they licensed a six-issue comic book adaptation of the novelization of the 1933 film to Monster Comics, and commissioned an illustrated novel in 1994 called Anthony Browne's King Kong. In 2013, they became involved with a musical stage play based on the story, called King Kong: The Eighth Wonder of the World which premiered in June 2013 in Australia and then on Broadway in November 2018.Hetrick, Adam. \\"King Kong Sets Broadway Opening Night\\", Playbill.com, November 8, 2017 The production is involved with Global Creatures, the company behind the Walking with Dinosaurs arena show. In 1996, artist/writer Joe DeVito partnered the Merian C. Cooper estate to write and/or illustrate various publications based on Merian C. Cooper's King Kong property through his company, DeVito ArtWorks, LLC. Through this partnership, DeVito created the prequel/sequel story Skull Island on which DeVito based a pair of original novels relating the origin of King Kong: Kong: King of Skull Island, and King Kong of Skull Island. In addition, the Cooper/DeVito collaboration resulted in an origin-themed comic book miniseries with Boom! Studios, an expanded rewrite of the original Lovelace novelization, Merian C. Cooper's King Kong, (the original novelization's publishing rights are still in the public domain), and various crossovers with other franchises such as Doc Savage, Tarzan and Planet of the Apes. In 2016, DeVito ArtWorks, through its licensing program, licensed its King Kong property to RocketFizz for use in the marketing of a soft drink called King Kong Cola. and have plans for a live action TV show to be co-produced between MarVista Entertainment and IM Global. In April 2016, Joe DeVito sued Legendary Pictures and Warner Bros., producers of the film Kong: Skull Island, for using elements of his Skull Island universe, which he claimed that he created and that the producers had used without his permission. RKO (whose rights consisted of only the original film and its sequel) signed over the North American, Latin American and Australian distribution rights to its film library to Ted Turner in a period spanning 1986 to 1989 via his company Turner Entertainment. Turner merged his company into Time Warner (now WarnerMedia) in 1996, which is how Warner Bros. owns distribution rights in those regions to those two films today, with the copyright over the films (including King Kong and The Son of Kong) remaining with RKO Pictures, LLC (various companies distribute the RKO library in other territories). In 1998, Warner Bros. Family Entertainment released the direct- to-video animated musical film The Mighty Kong, which re-tells the plot of the original 1933 film. 19 years later; in 2017, Warner Bros. co-produced the film Kong: Skull Island and in 2021 will co-produce the film Godzilla vs. Kong, after Legendary Pictures brought the projects from Universal to their company to build up the MonsterVerse. DDL (whose rights were limited to only their 1976 remake) did a sequel in 1986 called King Kong Lives (but they still needed Universal's permission to do so). Today most of DDL's film library is owned by Studio Canal, which includes the rights to these two films. The domestic (North American) rights to the 1976 King Kong film still remain with the film's original distributor Paramount Pictures, with Trifecta Entertainment & Media handling television rights to the film via their license with Paramount. =King Kong (Toho)= In the 1960s, Japanese studio Toho licensed the character from RKO and produced two films that featured the character, King Kong vs Godzilla (1962) and King Kong Escapes (1967). Toho's interpretation differed greatly from the original in size and abilities. King Kong as depicted in the cartoon show Among kaiju, King Kong was suggested to be among the most powerful in terms of raw physical force, possessing strength and durability that rivaled that of Godzilla. As one of the few mammal-based kaiju, Kong's most distinctive feature was his intelligence. He demonstrated the ability to learn and adapt to an opponent's fighting style, identify and exploit weaknesses in an enemy, and utilize his environment to stage ambushes and traps. In King Kong vs. Godzilla, Kong was scaled to be tall. This version of Kong was given the ability to harvest electricity as a weapon and draw strength from electrical voltage. In King Kong Escapes, Kong was scaled to be tall. This version was more similar to the original, where he relied on strength and intelligence to fight and survive. Rather than residing on Skull Island, Toho's version of Kong resided on Faro Island in King Kong vs. Godzilla and on Mondo Island in King Kong Escapes. In 1966, Toho planned to produce Operation Robinson Crusoe: King Kong vs. Ebirah as a co-production with Rankin/Bass Productions, however Ishir≈ç Honda was unavailable at the time to direct the film and, as a result, Rankin/Bass backed out of the project, along with the King Kong license. Toho still proceeded with the production, replacing King Kong with Godzilla at the last minute and shot the film as Ebirah, Horror of the Deep. Elements of King Kong's character remained in the film, reflected in Godzilla's uncharacteristic behavior and attraction to the female character Daiyo. Toho and Rankin/Bass later negotiated their differences and co-produced King Kong Escapes in 1967, loosely based on Rankin/Bass' animated show. Toho Studios wanted to remake King Kong vs. Godzilla, which was the most successful of the entire Godzilla series of films, in 1991 to celebrate the 30th anniversary of the film, as well as to celebrate Godzilla's upcoming 40th anniversary. However, they were unable to obtain the rights to use Kong, and initially intended to use Mechani-Kong as Godzilla's next adversary. But it was soon learned that even using a mechanical creature who resembled Kong would be just as problematic legally and financially for them. As a result, the film became Godzilla vs. King Ghidorah, with no further attempts to use Kong in any way.

Three television shows have been based on King Kong: The King Kong Show (1966), Kong: The Animated Series (2000), and Kong: King of the Apes (2016). A simulated version of King Kong cameos in the 2018 film Ready Player One. Cultural impact The DC Comics character Titano the Super-Ape (here seen climbing the Daily Planet building and confronting Superman) appears to be modeled on King Kong. From Superman #138, art by Curt Swan and Stan Kaye. King Kong, as well as the series of films featuring him, have been featured many times in popular culture outside of the films themselves, in forms ranging from straight copies to parodies and joke references, and in media from comic books to video games. The Beatles' 1968 animated film Yellow Submarine includes a scene of the characters opening a door to reveal King Kong abducting a woman from her bed. The Simpsons episode \\"Treehouse of Horror III\\" features a segment called \\"King Homer\\" which parodies the plot of the original film, with Homer as Kong and Marge in the Ann Darrow role. It ends with King Homer marrying Marge and eating her father. The 2006 animated film Chicken Little features a scene parodying King Kong, as Fish out of Water starts stacking magazines thrown in a pile, eventually becoming a model of the Empire State Building and some plane models, as he imitates King Kong in the iconic scene from the original film. The British comedy TV series The Goodies made an episode called \\"Kitten Kong\\", in which a giant cat called Twinkle roams the streets of London, knocking over the British Telecom Tower. The controversial World War II Dutch resistance fighter Christiaan Lindemans‚Äîeventually arrested on suspicion of having betrayed secrets to the Nazis‚Äîwas nicknamed \\"King Kong\\" due to his being exceptionally tall. Frank Zappa and The Mothers of Invention recorded an instrumental about \\"King Kong\\" in 1967 and featured it on the album Uncle Meat. Zappa went on to make many other versions of the song on albums such as Make a Jazz Noise Here, You Can't Do That on Stage Anymore, Vol. 3, Ahead of Their Time, and Beat the Boots. The Kinks recorded a song called \\"King Kong\\" as the B-side to their 1969 \\"Plastic Man\\" single. In 1972, a fiberglass statue of King Kong was erected in Birmingham, England. The second track of The Jimmy Castor Bunch album Supersound from 1975 is titled \\"King Kong\\". Filk Music artists Ookla the Mok's \\"Song of Kong\\", which explores the reasons why King Kong and Godzilla should not be roommates, appears on their 2001 album Smell No Evil. Daniel Johnston wrote and recorded a song called \\"King Kong\\" on his fifth self- released music cassette, Yip/Jump Music in 1983, rereleased on CD and double LP by Homestead Records in 1988. The song is an a cappella narrative of the original movie's story line. Tom Waits recorded a cover version of the song with various sound effects on the 2004 release, The Late Great Daniel Johnston: Discovered Covered. ABBA recorded \\"King Kong Song\\" for their 1974 album Waterloo. Although later singled out by ABBA songwriters Benny Andersson and Bj√∂rn Ulvaeus as one of their weakest tracks.,Sleeve notes, Waterloo re- issue, Carl Magnus Palm, 2014 it was released as a single in 1977 to coincide with the 1976 film playing in theatres.

In female religious institutes, the equivalent role is the lay sister. In male religious institutes, lay brothers are additionally distinguished from choir religious in that they do not receive holy orders and are therefore not clerics. Lay brother and lay sisters roles were originally created to allow those who were skilled in particular crafts or did not have the required education to study for holy orders to participate in and contribute to the life of a religious order. History In early Western monasticism, there was no distinction between lay and choir religious. The majority of St. Benedict's monks were not clerics, and all performed manual labour, the word conversi being used only to designate those who had received the habit late in life, to distinguish them from the oblati and nutriti. But, by the beginning of the 11th century, the time devoted to study had greatly increased, thus a larger proportion of the monks were in Holy Orders, even though great numbers of illiterate persons had embraced the religious life. At the same time, it was found necessary to regulate the position of the famuli, the hired servants of the monastery, and to include some of these in the monastic family. So in Italy the lay Brothers were instituted; and we find similar attempts at organization at the Abbey of St. Benignus at Dijon, under William of Dijon (d. 1031) and Richard of Verdun (d. 1046), while at Hirschau Abbey, Abbot William (d. 1091) gave a special rule to the fratres barbati and exteriores. A misericord in the choir stalls for lay brethren (1280s) at Bad Doberan minster - Temptation of a lay brother by the devil At Cluny Abbey the manual work was relegated mostly to paid servants, but the Carthusians, the Cistercians, the Order of Grandmont, and most subsequent religious orders possessed lay Brothers, to whom they committed their secular cares. In particular, at Grandmont, the complete control of the order's property by the lay brothers led to serious disturbances, and finally to the ruin of the order; whereas the wiser regulations of the Cistercians provided against this danger and formed the model for the later orders. In England, the Benedictines made but slight use of lay brothers, finding the service of paid attendants more convenient. Nonetheless, they are mentioned in the customaries of the Abbey of St. Augustine at Canterbury and the Abbey of St. Peter at Westminster. In 1965, the Second Vatican Council issued the document Perfectae Caritatis, which called upon all religious institutes to re-examine and renew their charism. As part of the subsequent reforms and experimentation, many of the distinctions between lay and choir religious in terms of dress and spiritual regimen were abolished or mitigated. In many religious institutes, lay and choir religious wear the same habit. Life as a lay brother Lay brothers were found in many religious orders. Drawn from the working classes, they were pious and hardworking people, who though unable to achieve the education needed to receive holy orders, were still drawn to religious life and were able to contribute to the order through their skills. Some were skilled in artistic handicrafts, others functioned as administrators of the orders' material assets. In particular, the lay brothers of the Cistercians were skill in agriculture, and have been credited for the tilling of fertile farmland. Lay brothers were sometimes distinguished from their brethren by some difference in their habit: for instance, the Cistercian lay brother previously wore a brown tunic, instead of white, with the black scapular; in choir they wore a large cloak, instead of a cowl; the Vallombrosan lay brothers wore a cap instead of a hood, and their habit was shorter; the English Benedictine lay brothers wore a hood of a different shape from that of the choir monks, and no cowl; a Dominican lay brother would wear a black, instead of a white, scapular. In some orders they were required to recite daily the Little Office of the Blessed Virgin Mary, but usually their labor in the fields (and hence away from the church) prevented them from participating in the Liturgy of the Hours. Lay brothers would instead pray Paters, Aves, and Glorias. =Lay sisters= Lay sisters were found in most of the orders of women, and their origin, like that of the lay brothers, is to be found in the necessity of providing the choir nuns with more time for the Office and study, as well as creating the opportunity for the illiterate to join the religious life. They, too, wore a habit different from those of the choir sisters, and their required daily prayers consisted of prayers such as the Little Office or a certain number of Paters. The system of lay sisters seem to have appeared earlier than that of lay brothers, being first recorded in a ninth century hagiography of Saint Denis. In the early medieval period, there was also mention of lay brothers attached to convents of women and of lay sisters attached to monasteries. In both configurations, the two sexes were strictly kept separate, housed in distinct buildings. This arrangement, however, has since been long abolished.

Such travel, using one location as a homebase, is popular with these travelers, perhaps going elsewhere for day at a time, and returning that evening. For example, a traveler staying in Z√ºrich might depart to a city or town such as Lucerne, Winterthur, or Zug in the morning on such a day trip -- perhaps to areas or countries near the travelers' home region.  History  In medieval times a destination, for such a days would be religious (to a nearby shrine) or commercial for example to a seasonal fair). Later, in England, visits to stately homes by those who regarded themselves middle class became frequent and it was the tradition to reward the butler or housekeeper with a tip (gratuity) for providing access to their employer's home. As such homes were meant for show it is unlikely that the owning family would object, provided they were not in residence at the time. The arrival of the railway excursion, often using Day Tripper tickets, in the mid 19th century saw the blossoming of a distinctive day-tripper industry. Trippers also travelled in their thousands by paddlesteamer or steamship to the many piers around Victorian era seaside resorts. The General Slocum excursion was an example. Cycling became a very popular day-tripper activity, especially amongst urban and suburban workers from the mid-1880s onwards. Coach and charabanc outings followed as the internal combustion engine became reliable enough to get the paying customers out and back again. Works outings and church or chapel excursions were extremely popular until the 1970s. While all of the foregoing still exist, the modern day-tripper experience is usually by motor car as a result of the growth of car ownership. Also, airlines such as Palmair promote day trips.

The version generally considered the prime version, the earlier of the two, is unrestored and hangs in the Louvre in Paris. The other, which was restored between 2008‚Äì2010, hangs in the National Gallery, London. The paintings are both nearly 2 metres (over 6 feet) high and are painted in oils. Both were originally painted on wooden panels, but the Louvre version has been transferred to canvas. Both paintings show the Madonna and child Jesus with the infant John the Baptist and an angel Uriel, in a rocky setting which gives the paintings their usual name. The significant compositional differences are in the gaze and right hand of the angel. There are many minor ways in which the works differ, including the colours, the lighting, the flora, and the way in which sfumato has been used. Although the date of an associated commission is documented, the complete histories of the two paintings are unknown, leading to speculation about which of the two is earlier. Two further paintings are associated with the commission: side panels each containing an angel playing a musical instrument and completed by associates of Leonardo. These are both in the National Gallery, London. The paintings =Louvre version= The Virgin of the Rocks in the Louvre is considered by most art historians to be the earlier of the two and dates from around 1483‚Äì1486. Most authorities agree that the work is entirely by Leonardo. It is about 8 cm (3 in) taller than the London version. The first certain record of this picture dates from 1625, when it was in the French royal collection. It is generally accepted that this painting was produced to fulfill a commission of 1483 in Milan. It is hypothesised that this painting was privately sold by Leonardo and that the London version was painted at a later date to fill the commission. There are a number of other theories to explain the existence of two paintings. This painting is regarded as a perfect example of Leonardo's \\"sfumato\\" technique. =London version= A very similar painting in the National Gallery, London, is also ascribed to Leonardo da Vinci, and ascribed a date before 1508. Originally thought to have been partially painted by Leonardo's assistants, a close inspection of the painting during the recent restoration between 2008 and 2010 has led the conservators from the National Gallery to conclude that the greater part of the work is by the hand of Leonardo, but debate continues.\\"The daffodil code: doubts revived over Leonardo‚Äôs Virgin of the Rocks in London\\", Dalya Alberge, The Guardian, 9 December 2014 Parts of the painting, the flowers in particular, indicate the collaboration and have led to speculation that the work is entirely by other hands, possibly Leonardo's assistant Giovanni Ambrogio de Predis and perhaps Evangelista. It was painted for the chapel of the Confraternity of the Immaculate Conception, in the church of San Francesco Maggiore in Milan. It was sold by the church, very likely in 1781, and certainly by 1785, when it was bought by Gavin Hamilton, who took it to England. After passing through various collections, it was bought by the National Gallery in 1880. =Angels= Two paintings of angels playing musical instruments are believed to have been part of the composition that was set into the altarpiece. These two pictures, now in the National Gallery, London, are thought to have been completed between 1490 and 1495. One, an angel in red, is thought to be the work of Ambrogio de Predis while the angel in green is thought to be the work of a different assistant of Leonardo, perhaps Francesco Napoletano. History =Chapel of the Immaculate Conception= The Chapel of the Immaculate Conception was founded prior to 1335 by , wife of Gian Galeazzo Visconti, Duke of Milan. The chapel was attached to the church of S. Francesco Grande, Milan. In 1479 the Confraternity of the Immaculate Conception contracted Francesco Zavattari and Giorgio della Chiesa to decorate the vault of the chapel. In 1480 the Confraternity of the Immaculate Conception contracted Giacomo del Maino to create a large wooden altarpiece with spaces for paintings and with carvings and decoration, to be placed above the altar of the chapel. Final payment was to be made on August 7, 1482. =Commission for the painting= On April 25, 1483, Prior Bartolomeo Scorlione and the Confraternity contracted Leonardo da Vinci, and the brothers Ambrogio and Evangelista de Predis to provide the painted panels for the altarpiece.Angela Ottino della Chiesa, The Complete Paintings of Leonardo da Vinci pp. 93‚Äì95 The contract was not explicit about what each artist was to do. Leonardo was referred to in the contract as \\"Master\\". Ambrogio de Predis was also a painter. It is presumed that Evangelista de Predis was a gilder and assisted in preparing the colours. The details of the painting, colouring and gilding are set out in the contract. The central panel was to be a painting showing the Virgin Mary and Christ child, with two prophets, probably David and Isaiah, surrounded by angels. Above them was to be a lunette containing a relief panel of God and the Virgin Mary, beneath which was a panel showing the crib. The relief figures were to be brightly painted and gilded. To either side of the central painting were to be painted panels showing four angelic musicians on one side and four singing angels on the other. A number of sculptured relief panels were to depict the life of the Virgin Mary. Details of the colours and the gilding of the major parts were specified in the contract.Angela Ottino della Chiesa, p. 93 The due date of installation was December 8, 1483, the Feast Day of the Immaculate Conception, giving seven months for its completion. =Payment= On May 1, 1483 there was an initial payment of 100 Lire. This was followed by payments of 40 Lire per month from July 1483 until February 1485 totalling 800 Lire. A final payment was to be negotiated upon completion and delivery of the work in December 1483. Between 1490‚Äì95, Ambrogio and Leonardo wrote to the Confraternity stating that the centrepiece had cost the whole 800 Lire and they asked for a further 1,200 Lire, according to the contract. The Confraternity offered them only 100 Lire as a result of the petition. Leonardo and Ambrogio then requested Ludovico Sforza, the Duke of Milan, to intervene on their behalf. It was suggested that the altarpiece should be assessed by experts and evaluated, for the final payment. The artists also suggested that if an agreement over price could not be met, then they should remove the artwork. In 1503 Ambrogio again appealed for payment, on his own behalf and that of the heirs of his now deceased brother, Evangelista. On March 9, 1503, Louis XII of France, who had invaded Lombardy in 1499, wrote to the commander of Milan requesting that he intervene on behalf of the artists. On June 23, 1503, the Confraternity set out a deed contesting de Predis' request for evaluation or return of the painting. On April 27, 1506, an evaluation was made. It was judged that the work was still incomplete. Leonardo was requested to finish it, but he was still absent from Milan. On August 18, 1508, the painting was delivered and put into place. On August 7, 1507, and October 23, 1508, Ambrogio received two payments totalling 200 Lire. The receipt of this payment is acknowledged in correspondence by Leonardo. =1524‚Äì2011= National Gallery painting In 1524 and 1576 The Virgin of the Rocks in the Chapel of the Immaculate Conception, presumably the London version, was invoked against the plague.Wasserman, p 110 In 1576, the altarpiece was removed from the chapel, which was demolished. In mid-1785, Gavin Hamilton, a Scottish painter and dealer, paid 1,582 Lire to purchase the Virgin of the Rocks from Alessandro, Count Cicogna, administrator of the religious body which succeeded the Confraternity of the Immaculate Conception. Hamilton's heirs sold the painting to Lord Lansdowne, who had amassed considerable debts. After his death in 1805, his son John was forced to sell nearly all of his father's collections, and the painting was purchased by the 15th Earl of Suffolk. In 1880, the painting was sold by the 18th Earl of Suffolk to the National Gallery for 9,000 guineas. It was reported at that time to be in a poor state and was attributed by some critics to Leonardo and by others to Bernardino Luini. In June 2005, the painting was examined by infra-red reflectogram. This imaging revealed a draft of a different painting beneath the visible one. The draft portrays a woman, probably kneeling, with her right hand outstretched and her left on her heart.White, Susan D. (2006). Draw Like Da Vinci. London: Cassell Illustrated. . p. 137. Some researchers believe that the artist's original intention was to paint an adoration of the infant Jesus. Many other pentimenti are visible under x-ray or infra-red examination. In 2009/2010 the painting underwent cleaning and conservation work,\\"The Virgin of the Rocks: Da Vinci decoded\\", Jonathan Jones, The Guardian, 13 July 2010 returning to display in July 2010. The National Gallery, in a preliminary announcement of the results of the work, said that it revealed that the painting was largely, possibly entirely, by Leonardo, and unfinished in parts. The full publication of the findings was released later in 2010. Louvre painting In 1625 the Virgin of the Rocks now in the Louvre was seen at Fontainebleau by Cassiano dal Pozzo. In 1806, the French restorer Fr Hacquin transferred the Louvre Virgin of the Rocks from its panel onto canvas. For a brief time in 2011‚Äì12 it was hung with the London painting as part of an exhibition in the National Gallery on Leonardo's activity as painter to the court of Ludovico Sforza. Side panels The two panels from the completed altarpiece containing figures of angels playing musical instruments were acquired by the National Gallery, London in 1898. Subject Detail of Christ Child and angel, Louvre Female head study by Leonardo for the Madonna of the Rocks, Royal Library of Turin The subject of the two paintings is the adoration of the Christ child by the infant John the Baptist. This subject relates to a non-Biblical event which became part of the medieval tradition of the holy family‚Äôs journey into Egypt. The Gospel of Matthew relates that Joseph, the husband of Mary, was warned in a dream that King Herod would attempt to kill the child Jesus, and that he was to take the child and his mother and flee to safety.The Gospel of Matthew, Chapter 2, verses 13‚Äì15 There are a series of non-Biblical narratives that relate to the journey to Egypt. One of these concerns Jesus‚Äô cousin, John the Baptist, whose family, like that of Jesus, resided in the town of Bethlehem where the Massacre of the Innocents was to take place. According to legend, John was escorted to Egypt by the Archangel Uriel, and met the holy family on the road. The Louvre website refers to the angel in the painting as \\"Gabriel\\" (but the description of the painting in the Louvre still refers to Uriel). This accords with the Apocryphal gospel of John the Baptist, which describes his removal from Bethlehem as by Gabriel rather than Uriel and does not mention the meeting on the road to Egypt. The subject of the Virgin Mary with the Christ child being adored by John the Baptist was common in the art of Renaissance Florence. John the Baptist is the patron saint of Florence and has often been depicted in the art of that city.Paoletti and Radke, p. 79 Those who painted and sculpted the subject of the Mary and child with St John include Fra Filippo Lippi, Raphael, and Michelangelo.Paoletti and Radke, p. 261David Thompson, Raphael, the Life and Legacy, BBC, (1983), Ludwig Goldscheider, Michelangelo: Paintings, Sculptures, Architecture, Phaidon, (!964) In both paintings the scene is depicted taking place against a background of rock formations. While scenes of the Nativity were sometimes depicted as taking place in a cave, and Kenneth Clark points to the existence of an earlier rocky landscape in an adoration painted for the Medici family by Fra Filippo Lippi,Clark, p. 51 the setting was unprecedented and gave to the paintings their usual name of the Virgin of the Rocks. Description =Composition= The two paintings of the Virgin of the Rocks that now belong to the National Gallery, London, and that belonging to the Louvre Museum, Paris, are the same in subject matter and in overall composition, indicating that one is derivative of the other. The two paintings differ in compositional details, in colour, in lighting and in the handling of the paint. Both paintings show a grouping of four figures, the Virgin Mary, the Christ child, the infant John the Baptist and an angel arranged into a triangular composition within the painting and set against a background of rocks, and a distant landscape of mountains and water. In both paintings, Mary makes the apex of the pyramidal figure group, stretching one hand to include John and raising the other above the head of the Christ child in a blessing. John kneels, gazing towards the Christ child with his hands together in an attitude of prayer. The Christ child sits towards the front of the painting, supported by the angel, and raising his right hand in a sign of Benediction towards the kneeling John. =Differences= Compositionally, all the figures are slightly larger in the London painting than in the Louvre painting.Angela Ottino della Chiesa, p. 94 The main compositional difference between the two paintings is that while in the London painting the angel's right hand rests on his/her knee, in the Louvre painting the hand is raised, the index finger pointing at John. The eyes of the angel are turned down in a contemplative manner in the London painting, but in the Louvre picture are turned to gaze in the general direction of the viewer.Jack Wasserman, pp. 108‚Äì118 In the London painting, all the forms are more defined, including the bodily forms of the clothed figures. The rocks are painted in meticulous detail, while the forms of the background in the painting in the Louvre are all more hazy. The contrast between light and shade on the figures and faces in the London painting are all much sharper. The faces and forms in the Louvre painting are more delicately painted and subtly blurred by sfumato. The lighting in the Louvre painting is softer and appears warmer, but this may be the result of the tone of the varnish on the surface. In keeping with their conservative handling of Leonardo's works, the Louvre version has not undergone significant restoration or cleaning. The Louvre painting remains much as it was in 1939 when Kenneth Clark lamented that \\"We can form no real conception of the colour, the values, or the general tone of the original, buried as it is under layer upon layer of thick yellow varnish. In the darks some mixture of bitumen has made the surface cake and crack like mud, and there are innumerable patches of old repaint all over the picture. All this must be borne in mind before we say that at this date Leonardo was a dark painter and an uninteresting colourist.\\"Leonardo da Vinci: An Account of his development as an Artist Detail of green angel Another difference is in the colouring of the robes, particularly those of the angel. The London painting contains no red, while in the Louvre painting, the angel is robed in bright red and green, with the robes arranged differently from those of the angel in London. The London version contains traditional attributes missing from the Louvre version, the haloes and John's traditional cruciform reed staff. Davies says it is \\"not certain\\" if these details which are painted in gold are contemporary with the painting or have been added by a later artist. The details of the flowers are also quite different in the two paintings, with those in the Louvre painting being botanically accurate, and those in the London painting being fanciful creations.Luke Syson interviewed by Alistair Sooke, The Virgin of the Rocks compared, accessed 2011-12-12 =Angel musicians= The two paintings of angels that are associated with the Virgin of the Rocks and are in the National Gallery do not properly fulfil the original commission for two panels each showing four angels, singing on one side and playing musical instruments on the other. There are only two musicians, both turned the same direction and both playing musical instruments. One, in green, plays a vielle, and the other, in red, plays a lute. The positions of the feet and the drapery are similar, indicating that the same design has in part been utilised for both. The angel in red is thought to be the work of Ambrogio de Predis.Billinge, Syson and Spring, Altered Angels accessed 2012-02-06 The angel in green is the work of an unknown associate of Leonardo. The National Gallery suggests that it might be the work of Francesco Napoletano. In both cases the angel is standing in a grey painted niche. A reflectogram of the Angel in green with a Vielle revealed part of a painted landscape. The background of the Angel in red with a Lute could not be determined because the grey paint on that painting is thick and opaque. While it is commonly thought that the two angel panels were originally placed on either side of the central panel, an article published by the National Gallery suggests that they were placed higher up on the altarpiece. Interpretation Detail, London The relationship between the two paintings ‚Äúremains much debated‚Äù.Paoletti and Radke, p. 362 Matters of debate include the dates of the two paintings, their authorship and the nature of their symbolism. For a few months in 2011 and 2012 the two paintings were brought together, possibly for the first time, in the same room in an exhibition at the National Gallery. =Dates= It is generally accepted by art historians that the Louvre version is the earlier work. Martin Davies, former director of the National Gallery, described the painting in the Louvre as being stylistically close to Leonardo's earlier works and the London painting more suggestive of his maturer style, and therefore that later of the two, and derivative of the Louvre painting. Most authors agree that the Louvre painting was the one that was painted to fulfil the commission of 1483.Kemp, Z√∂llner and others Some writers, including Martin Davies, feel that 1483 is too late a date for the Louvre version, and suggest that the painting had already been begun and perhaps completed in Florence before the commission. Wasserman, Ottino della Chiesa and others have pointed out that the measurements of both paintings are compatible with the altarpiece, and that it is an unlikely coincidence that Leonardo painted a picture that fitted the dimensions, at a time prior to the commission. Wasserman suggests that perhaps the Louvre painting was extended to fit the arched shape, and that the joint is no longer visible since the painting was transferred to canvas in the 19th century.Wasserman, p. 108 Davies suggests that Leonardo painted the second version in the 1480s to fulfil the commission, and based it on the earlier work. Kenneth Clark agrees with this interpretation, placing the Louvre painting prior to 1481 and the London painting from 1483.Clark, pp. 49‚Äì53 The theory that is most commonly used to explain the existence of the two paintings is that Leonardo painted the Louvre Virgin of the Rocks to fulfil the commission, giving it a date of 1483, and that he then sold it to another client, and painted the London version as a replacement. In line with this theory, it is hypothesised that the Louvre painting was sold in the late 1480s, after some haggling over the final payment. The London painting was commenced in perhaps 1486 as a substitution for the \\"original\\" Louvre version, and was not ready for installation until 1508, after prolonged disagreement and negotiation. This explanation, which della Chiesa attributes to Venturi and Poggi,Angela Ottino della Chiesa, p. 95 has gained wide acceptance, and is the version of events described on both the National Gallery and the Louvre websites.National Gallery, Virgin of the RocksZ√∂llner F, Leonardo da Vinci, Taschen, (2003) p. 223 Martin Kemp dates the Louvre painting to 1483‚Äì1490 and the London painting to 1495‚Äì1508.Kemp, pp. 250‚Äì251 Not all authors agree with either the dating or the theory that the Louvre painting was the earlier, was sold, and the London painting done as a substitute. Taylor asserts that the London painting is stylistically the earlier of the two, being more meticulous, in keeping with the product of Leonardo's Florentine training, while the Louvre painting has more in common with the Last Supper and the Virgin and Child with St Anne, including the delicate use of sfumato.Tamsyn Taylor, Leonardo da Vinci and the \\"Virgin of the Rocks\\" and Comparison of style Taylor argues that the London painting fulfils the requirements of the commission of 1483 in terms of iconography, and that the iconography of the Louvre painting indicates that it was painted for an entirely different clientele, and gives it a date in the 1490s.Tamsyn Taylor, Summary of the case =Authorship= Bernardino Luini, The Holy Family with St. John. Museo del Prado, Madrid It has always been agreed that the Louvre Virgin of the Rocks is entirely by the hand of Leonardo da Vinci. The Virgin of the Rocks in London has generally been seen as having been designed by Leonardo and executed with the assistants. The Louvre website and various authors suggest that the entire painting is by Ambrogio de' Predis, painted under Leonardo's supervision between 1485‚Äì1508, or perhaps largely the work of de Predis, with minor intervention by Leonardo.Wasserman, p. 114; Marco Rosci, p. 55 Since the recent cleaning, National Gallery curator Luke Syson has stated that the quality which has been revealed indicates that the work is mostly from the hand of Leonardo, and that participation of members of Leonardo's workshop was almost certainly less than previously thought. Geologist Ann C. Pizzorusso argues that there are geological inaccuracies in the London version, unlike the Louvre version, which mean it is unlikely to have come from Leonardo's hand.Pizzorusso, Ann. Leonardo's Geology: The Authenticity of the \\"Virgin of the Rocks, pp. 197‚Äì200 Taylor disputes this, drawing attention to the fact that, at the time of writing, Pizzorusso had plainly not seen the glacial lakes to which she referred, and had mistaken clumps of moss for sandstone boulders.T. Taylor, Leonardo and the \\"Virgin of the Rocks\\", The Geology Copies and derivations In her 1967 book (published in English in 1985) Angela Ottino della Chiesa identifies four paintings derived to some degree from The Virgin of the Rocks: the Holy Family and St. John by Bernardino Luini in the Museo del Prado in Madrid, the Thuelin Madonna by Marco d'Oggiono in the Thuelin collection in Paris and the Holy Infants Embracing by Joos van Cleve in the Capodimonte Museum in Naples. This image was much copied by Flemish artists including Joos van Cleve and Quentin Matsys ‚Äì there is a small painting in Chatsworth by the latter. There is also a smaller copy of The Virgin of the Rocks (oil on wood) possibly by Joos van Cleve or his circle (private collection Berlin). There is a 16th-century copy in the Royal Collection, given as a birthday present to Queen Victoria in 1847 by her husband Prince Albert.\\"After Leonardo da Vinci, The Madonna of the Rocks, c.1508-160 References Bibliography * Louvre Official Website, Virgin of the Rocks, accessed 2011-12-11 * National Gallery, London Website, Virgin of the Rocks, accessed 2012-02-06  Rachel Billinge, Luke Syson and Marika Spring, Altered Angels: Two Panels from the Immaculate Conception Altarpiece once in San Francesco Grande, Milan, accessed 2012-01-05  Pizzorusso, Ann, Leonardo's Geology: The Authenticity of the \\"Virgin of the Rocks, Leonardo, Vol. 29, No. 3 (1996), pp. 197‚Äì200, The MIT Press, JSTOR  Tamsyn Taylor, (2011) Leonardo da Vinci and the \\"Virgin of the Rocks\\", accessed 2012-02-06 [The chapter \\"The Graphic Works\\" is by Frank Zollner & Johannes Nathan].

In the Russian Empire and early Soviet Union Mingrelians and Svans had their own census grouping, but were classified under the broader category of Georgian in the 1930s. They are Georgian Orthodox Christians, and were Christianized in the 4th‚Äì6th centuries. However, some remnants of pre-Christian beliefs have been maintained. Saint George (known as Jg√´r√¶g to the locals), a patron saint of Georgia, is the most respected saint. The Svans have retained many of their old traditions, including blood revenge, although this tradition has been declining over time and as law enforcement takes hold. Their families are small, and the husband is the head of his family. The Svan strongly respect the older women in families. Language Typically bilingual, they use both Georgian and their own, unwritten Svan language. However, Svan is being largely replaced by Georgian, which is the language of culture and education in Georgia. Genetics According to Y-DNA haplogroups, Svan people are almost entirely made up of DNA from one unique haplogroup F* (Y-DNA) known as haplogroup F[xI,G,J2,K], found in the Abazin (29%), Chechen (32%) and Dargin (27%) populations with the remaining 8% of their DNA being part of haplogroup G-M201.

They are normally used with direct-broadcast satellite (DBS) services, although digital terrestrial pay TV suppliers also use CAMs. PC Card form factor is used as the Common Interface form of Conditional Access Modules for DVB broadcasts. Major CAM manufacturers include: Neotion, SmarDTV & SMIT. Some encryption systems for which CAMs are available are Logiways, Nagravision, Viaccess, Mediaguard, Irdeto, KeyFly, Verimatrix, Cryptoworks, Mascom, Safeview, Diablo CAM and Conax. NDS VideoGuard encryption, the preferred choice of Sky Digital can only be externally emulated by a Dragon brand CAM. The NDS CAM which the Sky viewing card ordinarily uses is built into the Sky Digibox thus not visible. Dragon and Matrix, two popular cams with satellite television enthusiasts are multicrypt meaning each is capable of handling more than one encryption system. Matrix CAMs can be upgraded via the PC Card port in a laptop personal computer whereas a Dragon cam update is done via separate programmer hardware. Although not officially supported or acknowledged, multicrypt and programmable modules are a grey market in the pay-TV industry. The primary purpose of the CAM is to derive control words, which are short-term decryption keys for video. The effectiveness of a CAM depends on the tamper resistance of the hardware; if the hardware is broken, the functionality of the CAM can be emulated, enabling the content to be decrypted by non-subscribers. CAMs are normally removable so that they can be replaced after the hardware security is breached. Replacement of the CAMs in a system is called a card swap-out. CAM Modules come in two types: standard, intended for a single TV consumer and professional, made for an array of televisions connected to a rack of CAMs, like in a hospital or a hotel. The standard format for a CAM is a PC card which takes a smart card to authenticate, although CAMs with the 'smart card' burnt into memory, known as Cardless CAM, can be found. With the CI+ 2.0 certification came a new \\"USB Flash Drive\\" form factor. In addition, CAM emulators exist for many systems, either providing an interface to allow the use of more than one type of card, or a card not designed for that receiver.

''''' is a travelogue published in 1611 by Thomas Coryat of Odcombe, an English traveller and mild eccentric.  History  The book is an account of a journey undertaken, much of it on foot, in 1608 through France, Italy, Germany, and other European countries. Coryat (sometimes also spelled \\"Coryate\\" or \\"Coriat\\") conceived of the 1,975-mile (3,175 km) voyage to Venice and back in order to write the subsequent travelogue dedicated to Henry, Prince of Wales, at whose court he was regarded as somewhat of a buffoon and jester, rather than the wit and intellectual he considered himself. The extent to which Coryat invited such ridicule in pursuit of patronage and court favor is unclear. Among other things, Coryat's book introduced the use of the fork to England and, in its support of continental travel, helped to popularize the idea of the Grand Tour that rose in popularity later in the century. The book also included what is likely the earliest English rendering of the legend of William Tell. The work is particularly important to music historians for giving extraordinary details of the activities of the Venetian School, one of the most famous and progressive contemporary musical movements in Europe. The work includes an elaborate description of the festivities at the church of San Rocco in Venice, with polychoral and instrumental music by Giovanni Gabrieli, Bartolomeo Barbarino, and others.O'Callaghan, Michelle, \\"Patrons of the Mermaid tavern (act. 1611)\\". Oxford Dictionary of National Biography, Oxford University Press. Accessed 30 Nov 2014. Crudities was only twice reprinted at the time, so the first edition is quite rare today. Later, \\"modern\\" facsimiles were put out, in 1776 and 1905, which included the later trip to Persia & India. \\"Commendatory\\" verses A custom of Renaissance humanists was to contribute commendatory verses that would preface the works of their friends. In the case of this book, a playful inversion of this habit led to a poetic collection that firstly refused to take the author seriously; and then took on a life of its own. Prince Henry as Coryat's patron controlled the situation; and willy- nilly Coryat had to accept the publication with his book of some crudely or ingeniously false panegyrics. Further, the book was loaded with another work, Henry Peacham's Sights and Exhibitions of England, complete with a description of a perpetual motion machine by Cornelis Drebbel. Coryat, therefore, was jokingly mocked by a panel of contemporary wits and poets of his acquaintance. At the behest of the teenage prince, a series of verses was commissioned, of which 55 were finally included for publication. The authors of these verses, which included John Donne, Ben Jonson, Inigo Jones, and Sir Thomas Roe, among others, took especial liberties with personal anecdotes, finding Coryat's self-importance a ripe source of humour. The literary men known to Coryate were typically courtiers, or those whom he had met through Edward Phelips of the Middle Temple, a patron from Somerset. A full list of the authors (translated from Latin originals) is given in the margin in a 1905 edition. *·ºàœÄŒøŒ¥Œ∑ŒºŒøœÖŒΩœÑœåœÜŒπŒªoœÇ [Greek pseudonym] *Henry Neville *John Harrington *Lewes Lewkenor *Henry Goodier *John Payton junior *Henry Poole *Robert Phillips *Dudley Digges *Rowland Cotton *Robert Yaxley *John Strangwayes *William Clavel *John Scory *John Donne *Richard Martin *Laurence Whitaker *Hugo Holland *Robert Richmond *Walter Quin *Christopher Brooke *John Hoskins *John Pawlet *Lionel Cranfield *John Sutclin *Inigo Jones *George Sydenham *Robert Halswell *John Gyfford *Richard Corbet *John Dones *John Chapman *Thomas Campian *William Fenton *John Owen *Peter Alley *Samuel Page *Thomas Momford *Thomas Bastard *William Baker *T·Ω∏ ·ΩàœÅ·Ω∏œÇ-·ΩÄŒæ·Ω∫ [Greek pseudonym] *Josias Clarke *Thomas Farnaby *William Austin *Glareanus Vadianus *John Jackson *Michael Drayton *Nicholas Smith *Laurence Emley *George Griffin *John Davis *Richard Badley *Jean Loiseau de Tourval *Henry Peacham *James Field *Glareanus Vadianus *Richard Hughes *Thomas Coryat There were poems in seven languages. Donne wrote in an English/French/Italian/Latin/Spanish macaronic language. Peacham's was in what he called \\"Utopian\\", which was partly gibberish, and the pseudonymous Glareanus Vadianus (tentatively John Sanford) wrote something close to literary nonsense. The contribution of John Hoskyns is called by Noel Malcolm \\"the first specimen of full-blown literary English nonsense poetry in the seventeenth century\\". Coryat had to take this all in good part. The book appeared with engravings by William Hole, and the author received a pension. Shortly a pirate version of the verses appeared, published by Thomas Thorpe, under the title The Odcombian Banquet (1611). Modern analogues British travel writer and humourist Tim Moore retraced the steps of Coryat's tour of Europe, as recounted in his book Continental Drifter.

Terms Derived from the Mozilla Public License 1.1,CDDL_MPL_redline.pdf on sun.com (archived) the CDDL tries to address some of the problems of the MPL.CDDL Why Summary on sun.com (archived, 2005) Like the MPL, the CDDL is a weak copyleft license in-between GPL license and BSD/MIT permissive licenses, requiring only source code files under CDDL to remain under CDDL. Unlike strong copyleft licenses like the GPL, mixing of CDDL licensed source code files with source code files under other licenses is permitted without relicensing. The resulting compiled software product (\\"binary\\") can be licensed and sold under a different license, as long as the source code is still available under CDDL, which should enable more commercial business cases, according to Sun.McNealy: CDDL is 'best of both worlds' on zdnet.com by Aaron Tan (September 14, 2005)CDDL on tldrlegal.com Like the MPL the CDDL includes a patent grant to the licensee from all contributors (\\"patent peace\\"). However, in section 2.1(d), the patent grant is lost if the code implementing a patented feature is modified. This effectively undermines the open source nature of the CDDL as it pertains to those segments of code. History The previous software license used by Sun for its open source projects was the Sun Public License (SPL), also derived from the Mozilla Public License. The CDDL license is considered by Sun (now Oracle) to be SPL version 2. The CDDL was developed by a Sun Microsystems team (among them Solaris kernel engineer Andrew TuckerOpen source licenses, IP, and CDDL on Andrew Tuckers blog, \\"as one of the drafters of the CDDL I can at least comment on what the license says, and on our intentions in creating it.\\" (Tuesday April 12, 2005) and Claire Giordano), based on the MPL version 1.1. On December 1, 2004 the CDDL was submitted for approval to the Open Source Initiative and was approved as an open source license in mid January 2005. The second CDDL proposal, submitted in early January 2005, includes some corrections that prevent the CDDL from being in conflict with European Copyright law and to allow single developers to use the CDDL for their work. In 2006, in the first draft of the OSI's license proliferation committee report, the CDDL is one of nine preferred licenses listed as popular, widely used, or with strong communities.First draft of OSI's license proliferation report. Archived from the original on 2012-02-05. Retrieved 2013-01-03. While the Free Software Foundation (FSF) also considered the CDDL a free software license, they saw some incompatibilities with their GNU General Public License (GPL). =GPL compatibility= The question of whether and when both licenses are incompatible sparked debates in the free software domain in 2004 to 2006. For instance, the FSF considered the CDDL incompatible to their GPL license, without going into detail until 2016. Some describe the incompatibility as inherited from the MPL 1.1 (fixed with the MPL 2.0 according to the FSF) and as a complex interaction of several clauses. Some of the CDDL proponents describe the GPL/CDDL compatibility situation from another point of view, they see the problem more on the GPL side than the CDDL side. Some people argue that Sun (or the Sun engineer) as creator of the license made the CDDL intentionally GPL incompatible. According to Danese Cooper one of the reasons for basing the CDDL on the Mozilla license was that the Mozilla license is GPL-incompatible. Cooper stated, at the 6th annual Debian conference, that the engineers who had written the Solaris kernel requested that the license of OpenSolaris be GPL-incompatible. (alternate URL, see 27:27 through 28:24) Simon Phipps (Sun's Chief Open Source Officer at the time), who had introduced Cooper as \\"the one who actually wrote the CDDL\\", did not immediately comment, but later in the same video, he says, referring back to the license issue, \\"I actually disagree with Danese to some degree\\", while describing the strong preference among the engineers who wrote the code for a BSD-like license, which was in conflict with Sun's preference for something copyleft, and that waiting for legal clearance to release some parts of the code under the then unreleased GNU GPL v3 would have taken several years, and would probably also have involved mass resignations from engineers (unhappy with either the delay, the GPL, or both‚Äîthis is not clear from the video). Later, in September 2006, Phipps rejected Cooper's assertion in even stronger terms. Similarly, Bryan Cantrill, who was on Sun at that time and involved in the release of CDDL licensed software stated in 2015 that he and his colleagues expected in 2006 the fast emerge of CDDL licensed software into the Linux ecosystem and the CDDL being not an obstacle. =cdrtools controversy= The GPL compatibility question was also the source of a controversy behind a partial relicensing of cdrtools to the CDDL which had been previously all GPL. In 2006, the Debian project declared the cdrtools legally undistributable because the build system was licensed under the CDDL. The author, J√∂rg Schilling, claims that smake is an independent project and does not violate the GPLv3. Schilling also argues that even though the GPL requires all scripts required to build the work to be licensed freely, they do not necessarily have to be under the GPL. Thus not causing an incompatibility that violates the license. He also argues that in \\"combined works\\" (in contrast to \\"derived works\\") GPL and CDDL licensed code is compatible. Red Hat's attorneys have prevented cdrtools from being in Fedora or Red Hat Enterprise Linux, arguing that Schilling has an \\"unorthodox\\" view of copyright law that isn't shared by their legal counsel or the Free Software Foundation. =ZFS in the Linux kernel= In 2015, the CDDL to GPL compatibility question reemerged when Ubuntu announced inclusion of OpenZFS by default. In 2016 Ubuntu announced that a legal review resulted in the conclusion that it is legally acceptable to use ZFS as binary kernel module in Linux. (As opposed to building it into the kernel image itself.) Others followed Ubuntu's conclusion, for instance James E. J. Bottomley argued there can't be \\"a convincing theory of harm\\" developed, making it impossible to bring the case to court.Are GPLv2 and CDDL incompatible? on hansenpartnership.com by James E. J. Bottomley, \\"What the above analysis shows is that even though we presumed combination of GPLv2 and CDDL works to be a technical violation, there‚Äôs no way actually to prosecute such a violation because we can‚Äôt develop a convincing theory of harm resulting. Because this makes it impossible to take the case to court, effectively it must be concluded that the combination of GPLv2 and CDDL, provided you‚Äôre following a GPLv2 compliance regime for all the code, is allowable.\\" (23 February 2016) Eben Moglen, co-author of the GPLv3 and founder of the SFLC, argued that while the letters of the GPL might be violated, the spirit of both licenses is unharmed, which would be the relevant aspect in court. The SFLC mentioned also that a precedent exists with the Andrew File System's kernel module, which isn't considered a derivative work of the kernel by the kernel developers.Copying on git.kernel.org \\"NOTE! This copyright does *not* cover user programs that use kernel services by normal system calls ‚Äì this is merely considered normal use of the kernel, and does *not* fall under the heading of \\"derived work\\".\\" On the other hand, Bradley M. Kuhn and attorneySoftware Freedom Law Center Appoints Two New Attorneys to Defend and Support Free and Open Source Software (October 31, 2005) Karen M. Sandler from the Software Freedom Conservancy argued that Ubuntu would violate both licenses, as a binary ZFS module would be a derivative work of the kernel, and announced their intent to clarify this question, even by court.GPL Violations Related to Combining ZFS and Linux on sfconservancy.org by Bradley M.

We must do so, because, too often, companies are complacent about compliance.

The bark is dark brown, thick and deeply fissured at the base of the trunk. The leaves ('needles') are in mixed pairs and threes, slender, to long, and dull yellowish green, with stomata on both inner and outer surfaces. The cones are globose, to long and broad when closed, green at first, ripening yellow-brown when 18‚Äì20 months old, with only a small number of thick scales, with typically 5-12 fertile scales. The cones open to to broad when mature, holding the seeds on the scales after opening. The seeds are to long, with a thick shell, a pink endosperm, and a vestigial wing; they are dispersed by the Mexican jay, which plucks the seeds out of the open cones. The jay, which uses the seeds as a major food resource, stores many of the seeds for later use, and some of these stored seeds are not used and are able to grow into new trees. Abert's squirrel also feeds on the seeds in preference to those of the ponderosa pine.Hall, Joseph G. 1973. The Kiabab squirrel.

Santa Fe, New Mexico: New Mexico Department of Game and Fish: 18‚Äì21 History Mexican pinyon was the first pinyon pine described, named by Zuccarini in 1832. Many of the other pinyon pines have been treated as varieties or subspecies of it at one time or another in the past, but research in the last 10‚Äì50 years has shown that most are distinct species. Some botanists still include Johann's pinyon and Orizaba pinyon in Mexican pinyon; the former accounts for records of \\"Mexican pinyon\\" in southern Arizona and New Mexico. Mexican pinyon is a relatively non-variable species, with constant morphology over the entire range except for the disjunct population in the Sierra de la Laguna pine-oak forests of Baja California Sur; this is generally treated as a subspecies, Pinus cembroides subsp. lagunae, although some botanists treat it as a separate species, P. lagunae. This subspecies differs from the type in having slightly longer leaves, between and and longer, narrower cones, up to long. The seeds are widely collected in Mexico, being the main edible pine nut in the region. While palatable when raw, their flavor is considered to be improved when roasted.

As the store grew, it changed location three times over a period of sixteen years; it then remained in the same location, in a former bathroom fixtures showroom on Bardstown Road just south of Eastern Parkway in The Highlands, until late July 2010. It then moved to the Douglass Loop, a former streetcar turnaround point on Bardstown Road about southeast of its previous location but still in The Highlands. ear X-tacy carried a wide variety of CDs, cassettes, and vinyl records, and also carried a large stock of DVDs, including many hard-to-find items. In 1995, Timmons launched the ear X-tacy record label, which released records by Louisville-based musicians such as Tim Krekel. The building that the store occupied before its final move had two stories and 10,000 ft¬≤ (930 m¬≤) of floor space. The first floor was dedicated to CDs, DVDs, T-shirts, toys, etc. It also included a stage for live performances and a large selection of small and large stickers mocking current U.S. events or promoting Louisville. The second floor was dedicated to new & used vinyl records. The final store was on one floor, with comparable floor space. Like the previous location, it included a stage. Due to financial issues, ear X-tacy moved for the final time to a smaller location in 2010, just south of where their previous location was on Bardstown Road. However, the financial issues continued and ear X-tacy owner John Timmons made the decision to permanently close. ear X-tacy officially closed on October 31, 2011, but due to the amount of unsold inventory still remaining after the close, the store held a liquidation sale in December 2011 before officially closing for good. ear X-tacy also operated a second location in the Eastgate Shopping Center in Middletown from 1992 through 1998.

Odishi () was a historical district in western Georgia, the core fiefdom of the former Principality of Mingrelia, with which the name \\"Odishi\\" was frequently coterminous. Since the early 19th century, this toponym has been supplanted by Samegrelo (Mingrelia).  Geography  Like most historical regions of Georgia, Odishi had fluctuating borders. It was bounded by the Black Sea to the west and the Tskhenistsqali river to the east; to the northwest, Odishi bordered and at times expanded into Abkhazia; to the north were the mountains of Takveri, that is, the letter-day Lechkhumi, and Svaneti; and the Rioni river formed the border between Odishi and Guria to the south. In its narrower sense, Odishi referred to a tract of land between the Inguri and Tekhuri rivers, bathed by the Black Sea. The chief town and largest settlement was Zugdidi. Chqondidi at Martvili served as the principal Christian cathedral. A Georgian demonym for the people of Odishi was odishari.  History  Odishi first appears in the Georgian Chronicles under the reign of Queen Tamar (r. 1184‚Äì1213) as a fief ruled by the eristavi (\\"duke\\") of the dynasty with gentilitial titles of Bediani and Dadiani, derived from the respective localities. The dynasty, henceforth surnamed Dadiani, acceded to the rank of sovereign princes after the dissolution of the Kingdom of Georgia in the 1490s. Natively, and in the early modern Georgian historical literature, Odishi was the name of both the district and the whole Dadiani-ruled principality. The latter came to be known to the Europeans as Mingrelia after the principal group of people inhabiting it, but they were also familiar with Odishi as the name of one of the two principal subdivisions of the Principality of Mingrelia, the other being Lechkhumi. The Georgian equivalent of Mingrelia, Samegrelo, although referenced in much earlier records, did not enter the common usage until after the imposition of the Imperial Russian hegemony in 1804. The Mingrelian signatory to the 1804 treaty with Russia, Prince Grigol Dadiani, referred to himself as the \\"lawful Lord of Odishi, Lechkhumi, Svaneti, Abkhazia, and all the lands anciently belonging to the ancestors of mine.\\" The etymology of Odishi is not clear. However there is an explanation of this name in Lazuri language (A Colchis Language). Odi-shi (Odi≈üi) in Lazuri language meaning \\"From Odi\\". The early-18th-century Georgian scholar Prince Vakhushti, who included a detailed geographical account of the region in his Description of the Kingdom of Georgia, suggested a folk etymology of Odishi as meaning \\"once [odeshi] this land was ours.\\" A modern hypothesis relates Odishi to a pagan deity from the Mingrelian folklore, named Odi. The name of Odishi survives in those of a plateau in western Georgia, a village in the Zugdidi Municipality, and a broadcasting company based in Zugdidi.

He worked as a personal tutor and, accompanying a family to Gie√üen in 1839, he stayed on in Germany to study chemistry supervised by Justus von Liebig, earning a PhD in 1841. Career and research On returning to England the same year, he again considered Holy Orders but instead was attracted to Manchester to join the chemical laboratory of Lyon Playfair at the Royal Manchester Institution. Here he became involved in some of the environmental issues of the world's first industrial city (see History of Manchester). Playfair left for greener pastures in 1845 and Smith worked at making a living as an independent analytical chemist. After some initial alarming experiences, Smith refused to take on expert witness work which was a staple of consulting scientists of the day and which he saw as corrupt. Consequently, when the Alkali Inspectorate was established by the Alkali Act 1863, Smith's integrity made him the natural candidate. As Queen Victoria's Inspector of Alkali Works, he was the prototype of the scientific civil servant. He held the post until his death. He is buried in the graveyard of St Paul's Church on Kersal Moor, SalfordRetrieved on 10 June 2008 In 1872 Smith published the book Air and Rain: The Beginnings of a Chemical Climatology, which presents his studies of the chemistry of atmospheric precipitation. These studies include the discovery, in 1852, of acid rain in northern British cities, a consequence of the burning of coal rich in sulfur. He was conferred with Honorary Membership of the Institution of Engineers and Shipbuilders in Scotland in 1884. After his death his collection of about 4,000 books was acquired by the library of Owens College, Manchester. They are now in the John Rylands University Library, the successor of the college library. Spiritualism Smith with his friend William Crookes, attended a s√©ance on 21 April 1870 in London.

His music is influenced by classical music and jazz, but mostly by modern composers such as Morton Feldman, jazz improviser Keith Jarrett and modern artists such as Jackson Pollock and Clyfford Still. Most of his piano works are entirely improvisational and reflect a remarkably personal connection to his music. His work is noted by critics as being deeply reflective and heartfelt. There are those who also draw comparisons to the music of Cecil Taylor. Joel Garten has created a number of innovative works for prepared piano using paint brushes and other hardware on the strings of the piano. He studied experimental music under the tutelage of Toronto composer Martin Arnold. Garten's music was first produced by Jaymz Bee, a popular music producer and radio personality on JAZZ.FM91. He has performed in a number of cities in North America, as well as in the Registan in Samarkand, Uzbekistan. He was also invited by rock musician Bryan Adams to perform at his studio The Warehouse, where Garten performed an hour-long concert of his solo piano improvisations in 1999. Garten was also commissioned to write a work for Toronto's 200th birthday which he performed at Toronto's Casa Loma. Garten was a curator in 2006 at an exhibit in the Echigo Tsumari Triennial in Japan, the largest international art exhibit in Japan. In addition to his art curation at the Triennial, he wrote compositions that were inspired by his study of local folk music, which he performed in a solo piano concert in Hachi, Japan. He later performed these works in another solo piano concert at the Japan Foundation, Toronto. Garten performed an hour-long solo piano improvised concert at the Tenri Cultural Institute in 2010.

Tiger!\\": logo and illustration by Will H. Drake, St. Nicholas Magazine, Vol. XXI, 1894. \\"Tiger! Tiger!\\" is a short story by Rudyard Kipling. A direct sequel to \\"Mowgli's Brothers\\", it was published in magazines in 1893‚Äì94 before appearing as the third story in The Jungle Book (1894), following \\"Kaa's Hunting\\". The title is derived from William Blake's poem \\"The Tyger\\". Story After driving out the tiger Shere Khan, Mowgli leaves the wolf pack that has raised him and makes his way to a human village to be with his own (biological) kind. There he is adopted by a bereaved couple, Messua and her husband, due to his resemblance to their long-lost son Nathoo. The village priest agrees to this because it will keep Messua's rich husband happy. For three months Mowgli learns human language and customs such as wearing clothes, ploughing, money and caste divisions, few of which impress him. He is also disrespectful to the village elders when they tell fanciful tales of the jungle, such as claims of the tiger being the reincarnation of a lame money-lender, since he has first-hand experience of what the jungle is really like. What is not fanciful is the 100-rupee reward for the tiger's skin. During this period, Mowgli regularly sneaks out of the village to meet his wolf friend Grey Brother who brings him news of the jungle. To keep Mowgli out of trouble the village elders decide to put him to work herding buffalo. One day while taking a break from this task he meets Grey Brother again. The wolf tells him that Shere Khan has returned and is planning to kill Mowgli. For the next few weeks Grey Brother keeps watch on Shere Khan while Mowgli goes about his tasks in the village. Eventually he meets Mowgli again and tells him that Shere Khan is hiding in a nearby ravine in preparation to attack. Mowgli learns that Grey Brother obtained this information from Shere Khan's accomplice Tabaqui the jackal, before killing him. With the aid of Akela, Mowgli and Grey Brother divide the buffalo herd in two and stampede them from opposite ends of the ravine, trampling the tiger to death between them. Mowgli, who has promised to lay Shere Khan's skin on the wolf pack's Council Rock, sets about skinning the tiger. The village hunter Buldeo has been told of the stampede by the other village boys, and soon arrives to chastise Mowgli. Buldeo demands that Mowgli hand the skin over to him for the reward. Mowgli refuses, and summons Akela to restrain him. When Mowgli and Akela let him go, the frightened hunter returns to the village and tells the villagers Mowgli is a shapeshifting sorcerer. By the time the unsuspecting Mowgli returns with the buffalo, the entire village except Messua has turned against him and they drive him away. Confused and disgusted by their behaviour, Mowgli fulfils his promise to lay out Shere Khan's hide on Council Rock and dances upon it, singing of his emotional confusion. The pack offers to take Mowgli back, but he refuses to forgive them for casting him out earlier. Instead he decides that from now on he will hunt alone, except for his four wolf-brothers who refuse to be parted from him. The story ends with the statement that Mowgli will eventually grow up and get married, \\"but that is a story for grown-ups\\". This is clearly a reference to Kipling's earlier story \\"In the Rukh\\" (collected in Many Inventions), which was indeed aimed at adults, in which the adult Mowgli does marry.

It was the first major writing that gained him recognition. This work is part of the Russian realist tradition in that the narrator is usually an uncommitted observer of the people he meets.  Writing and publication  Turgenev based many of these short stories on his own observations while hunting at his mother's estate at Spasskoye, where he learned of the abuse of the peasants and the injustices of the Russian system that constrained them. The frequent abuse of Turgenev by his mother certainly had an effect on this work. The stories were first published singly in The Contemporary before appearing in 1852 in book form. Turgenev was about to give up writing when the first story, \\"Khor and Kalinich\\", was well received. The work as a whole actually led to Turgenev's house arrest (part of the reason, the other being his epitaph to Nikolai Gogol) at Spasskoye.  The list of stories  =Khor and Kalinych= The illustration for Khor and Kalinych by Elisabeth Bohm. 1883. Story of two peasants one who is extremely thrifty, and the other an idealist, both of whom work for a petty landowner named Polutykin. This introduces the role of the narrator as the uncommitted observer. Turgenev at once appears as a writer and an artist but also a social reformer and activist. The separation of the two peasants plays a big role in later works by the author, as he explained in a speech given in 1860 where he talks about the dichotomy of his ‚ÄúHamlet-like‚Äù and ‚ÄúQuixotic‚Äù characters. The main idea here though is displaying the intelligence of the peasants and the idiocy of their master. It is also perhaps one of his strongest arguments in favor of Westernization in Russia. =Yermolay and the Miller‚Äôs Wife= Story of the narrator's hunter friend and a night they spend at a miller's home. This is the first sketch he appears in. The man, Zverkov, gives the reader a clear idea of the injustices of serfdom, this being the main idea of this particular story. =Raspberry Water= Story of the narrator meeting and talking to two peasants at a little spring called Raspberry Water (which did exist and still exists in Russia). Here the narrator is very distant, akin to early Realist narrators, and learns of the self-deprivation peasants take upon themselves through the recollections of the old peasant named Foggy. =District Doctor= Struck with fever in a small village, the narrator is visited by a district doctor who tells him a story of how he fell in love with a dying girl. It is told from his perspective rather than the narrator's. =My Neighbor Radilov= Yermolay is with the narrator again. The story consists of them meeting a landowner named Radilov. They have dinner at his house and learn he is not a typical landowner and shows goodwill (he's not gloomy about his fate either). He mentions when his wife died and how he didn't really shed a tear until he saw a fly crawl over her eye. Radilov disappears at the end and the family he lived with does not know where he went. =Farmer Ovsyanikov= Pyotr Sokolov. 1890s. Poor landowner the narrator meets, who Turgenev uses to talk about the social ills of serfdom while avoiding the censors. He does nothing more than sit and talk. =Lgov= Yermolay and the narrator go hunting and meet up with Old Knot, an old peasant who's the local fisherman and has held several ridiculous positions in the area. This story is particularly noteworthy for its vivid character descriptions. The group goes hunting in the lake with a pretentious hunter named Vladimir, sink the boat and then wade to shore filthy after great difficulty. =Bezhin Lea= The narrator gets lost in the woods and comes across a clearing, where he meets up with five peasant boys near a fire who are guarding the horses. The narrator pretends to be asleep and the boys forget he is there and start talking about fairies and talking animals, stories that they believe to be true. The beauty of the story is typically found in the innocence of the young boys. Serfdom here is hidden in the background, never truly mentioned or argued against as in the other stories. =Kasyan from the Beautiful Lands= Kasyan from the Beautiful Lands. The drawing by Ivan Turgenev. Between 1860 and 1880. While in a carriage the narrator comes across a funeral procession and goes to Yudin village to get a new axle when theirs breaks. There he meets Kasyan, a fifty-year-old dwarf who lives in the village and who belongs to some unnamed religious sect. He takes them to get a new axle and the narrator notices how at one he seems with his environment and incredibly generous. Kasyan establishes his hatred of established society through his glorification of the world of folklore. =Bailiff= Story about the bailiff (Sofron) of a landowner friend of the narrator who is more in control of the land than Arkady Penochkin. He uses the peasants and steals their money from loans. This story is one of the most vivid examples of the peasantry's exploitation. =The Office= The narrator comes upon a small hut and travels to a village after speaking with an old man there. He comes across a run-down shack that is the main office of the local landowner. He stays there and overhears the head clerk abusing his powers and learns how he uses Losnyakova to abuse the peasants, for example sending away the lover of a young man so they cannot get married. The main idea here is the presentation of the ridiculous bureaucracy created to control the peasants. =Loner= At night in a droshky, the narrator comes across a man, Foma, in the forest who watches over his landowner's property so peasants don't steal wood. He learns the man's wife left him and their children alone and finds his home incredibly depressing. Foma eventually hears a peasant chopping down a tree and they go out to confront him. The forester takes him to his home and threatens to turn him into the landowner. The narrator tries to buy the peasant's wood so he can be set free, and though they fight at first, Foma eventually agrees and pushes the man out the door. Unlike the previous stories, this work was not featured in ‚ÄúThe Contemporary‚Äù and was only later added to the sketches in 1852. =Two Landowners= Story of two different landowners the narrator knows, with descriptions of mistreatment of the peasants including beatings and descriptions of their miserable huts. This again, gives the reader more callous examples of the treatment of the peasantry. =Lebedyan= Story about a village where the narrator comes across the horse fair. Of particular interest is the lieutenant Khlopakov, who uses catch phrases out of context regardless if they sound strange, which amuses his friend Zhukov. The narrator looks at horses and decides to purchase one, which ends up being lame but he gives up trying to get his money back for it when he realizes the seller's scheme. Turgenev's intentions here were to display the typical events at a local fair. =Tatyana Borisovna and her Nephew= Story about the modest landowner Tatyana whom everyone loves because she is so generous. In spite of being illiterate she is generous to everyone and does not care for typical dealings that landowners spend their time on and does not care for other women landowners in her area. In the story her nephew Andryusha (an orphan) comes to live with her and loves to draw. He eventually gains the interest of Pyotr Benevolensky, a local collegiate counsellor who is a minor acquaintance of Tatyana, who then takes him to St. Petersburg to be trained in art. When he returns, after asking his aunt for money through the mail several times, she finds he has become Benevolensky and is corrupted. He is fat and annoying and spends his time poorly singing words to songs written by Glinka. Her friends stop visiting her because he is so annoying. =Death= In this story the narrator opens with a hunting story concerning his neighbor. They find the trees in the area dying with many fallen onto the ground because of a terrible frost (this is an actual event from Russia in 1840). After this he and his friend come upon a peasant who they are told has been smashed by a tree and they watch him die. This reminds the narrator of several stories he remembers about dying and he uses them to explain how the Russian character presents itself when dying. Each character continues as if performing a ritual, not lamenting or even caring. One old woman, with her final breath, reaches for a ruble under her pillow to pay the priest who says her last rites. Here Turgenev appears to be commenting on the isolation of human personality in the face of nature. =Singers= Yakov the Turk Is Singing. The illustration for Singers by Boris Kustodiev. 1908. The narrator comes across a ‚Äúterrible village‚Äù and goes to a tavern set at the end of a ravine. In the tavern he finds that some locals are having a singing contest. The one, Yakov, has the gift of technical prowess. The other, Yasha, has natural talent. Yakov goes first and the group believes he's won due to the skill he displays but when Yasha sings, he sings beautifully with the ‚Äúcollective voice of the Russian identity,‚Äù leading everyone to cry with no discussion of his skill afterward. Yakov stammers that he won and they are about to drink, but the narrator is disturbed by this since he found the scene so beautiful amongst the horrible surroundings, and he goes outside to sleep while they drink. He leaves while hearing peasant boys calling to each other in the night. =Pyotr Petrovich Karataev= While at a post, the narrator meets a lower, uneducated landowner named Karataev who has lost his land because of an IOU. He learns from him that he once fell in love with a peasant girl named Matroyna, owned by another landowner. He attempts to buy her from the woman, but she forbids it because she simply does not want to and sends her away to another village. Karataev, in desperation, finds her and brings her home where he hides her for a time, eluding authorities by placing her away from his home. In the end she gives herself up and Karataev goes off to Moscow, where the narrator finds him later happy amongst friends but completely broke. =Meeting= While out hunting, the narrator happens to witness the meeting of a peasant girl who is in love with a pampered, pompous valet. When he comes he treats her disdainfully and leaves her to say he is going away after announcing he cannot marry her. The girl sheds tears and the narrator goes to her when she almost collapses, but she runs away when she notices him. =Hamlet of the Shchigrovsky District= Hamlet of the Shchigrovsky District. The drawing by Ivan Turgenev. Circa 1850 (?). In this story the narrator spends the evening at a party of a landowner named Alexander G. Here Turgenev gives excellent descriptions and parodies of the nobility. While attempting to go to sleep, the narrator finds his roommate unable to sleep as well and finds out that he is a man who has realized his uniqueness amongst the upper class, even though he is considered a wit. He is forever cursed to deep introspection and finds in himself nothing save a molded being with no true life. He leaves early in the morning without saying goodbye and the narrator never learns his name. =Chertopkhanov and Nedopyuskin= While hunting with Yermolay, the narrator comes across the landowner Chertopkhanov. He goes away on his horse and another man comes up, his friend Nedopyuskin. Chertopkhanov is the inheritor of a mortgaged little village called Unsleepy Hollow. His friend, Nedopyuskin, became close to him when the former saved him from a crowd of nobles who were tormenting him for being the inheritor of an estate despite the fact that he was so completely devoid of any bit of notoriety for anything. The two bachelors became the best of friends and live together at Unsleepy Hollow in peaceful tranquility in spite of the disrepair of the area. They embody the ‚Äúloner‚Äù figure Turgenev was so interested in, able to live independently in the system. =The End of Chertopkhanov= Sequel to the previous story, though published much later in 1872. It was originally not part of the sketches. This story is more sequential than the previous, detailing the end of the landowner up to his death. He faces three misfortunes. The first is his love Masha leaving him in true ‚Äúgypsy‚Äù spirit. The second is Nedopyuskin dying of a stroke. The third and final is the loss of his horse Malek Adel, the envy of local landowners who know of Chertopkhanov. One night it is stolen and he does everything in his power to find it, eventually coming across the horse at a fair. He buys it back and brings it home, but something bothers him about it. He begins to realize that the horse is not truly Malek Adel but one that looks like it and in despair he eventually shoots the animal in the head and stays in his bed afterwards. He no longer looks like himself, but when his servant comes up to him the last bit of his being comes forth and he declares that the nobleman Chertopkhanov is dying and no one can stand in his way. =Living Relic= This story was originally not part of the sketches either and appeared in another collection of stories first in 1874. Here, the narrator comes back to his home estate to find a beautiful servant named Lukeria in a horrible state. After falling from a porch she succumbs to an unknown digestive disorder (not explicitly stated, but implied) that reduces her to an unmoving, skeletal figure. She spends her time in the shed in the summer and near the house in the winter, moved about by the house servants who remain. The narrator is shaken by her disturbing ability to accept her fate, regardless of how terrible it may be. She is completely unable to move and finds her days accented only by the occasional sounds of new birds in the shed, smells, or a rabbit that may occasionally come in to visit her. She eventually dies in peace, completely aware that the day was coming because she saw it in her dreams. This story is slightly different from the others because of the inclusion of the ‚Äúunreal‚Äù found in Lukeria's dream states. The narrator is heartbroken by her condition, but is surprised to find her happy with life in spite of her state. Suggestions have been made that she is so happy because in her inability to move she is also unable to sin. =The Clatter of Wheels= Also added later to the sketches, but published after the original group in 1874. In this story Yermolay and the narrator find they are almost out of shot, so they decide to go to Tula to get more and fetch a peasant named Filofey. He takes the narrator there, Yermolay stays behind, but on the way hears a carriage clattering far in the distance that he is sure is a group of bandits who will surely murder them when they catch up. The carriage slowly overcomes them in spite of what they try and eventually comes in front of them. Several men are on it singing and laughing, completely drunk. Filofey tries to steer around but every time he does the head carriage moves into their way. When they come to a bridge the carriage stops and the largest of the men approaches. The narrator is sure they are to be killed but is surprised when he finds the drunk man only asking for a bit of money for drinks, stating they have just come from a wedding and want a bit more to celebrate. The narrator and Filofey are relieved and joke with each other about the event, but learn later on that on that very night a merchant was killed on the road and had his carriage stolen. Though uncertain and still joking, they wonder if the carriage that passed them was not in fact from a wedding at all. =Forest and Steppe= The traditional ending to the sketches, found in every edition. Here, Turgenev gives the readers detailed and beautiful descriptions of the hunter's life, ending the collection. Unfinished works An 1890s illustration to Lebedyan =The Russian German= An incomplete, short fragment first published in 1964 and never part of the original sketches. Here, the narrator comes across a German landowner in Russia. It is likely he kept this sketch out and never finished it because it did not present a picture of the typical, ‚ÄúRussian‚Äù landowner. Here though, he seems to be hinting that the ‚Äúgame‚Äù of the sketches is in fact the evils of serfdom and the failures of landowners. =The Reformer and the Russian German= Another incomplete, though slightly longer, fragment. This may have been a later version of the previous fragment or another fragment itself. It's completely different, with different characters, and again provides the readers with examples of the failures and cruelties of serfdom.  Legacy  This series of short stories revealed Turgenev's unique talent as a short story writer. Evidently it greatly influenced all Russian short story writers of the late 19th and early 20th centuries, such as Anton Chekhov, Ivan Bunin, Alexander Kuprin and many others. Other world writers also admired Turgenev's style. Sherwood Anderson was particularly influenced by Turgenev's literature. He considered A Sportsman's Sketches to be a paradigm for his own short stories. More recently, Turgenev has been criticized for his somewhat idealized characterization of muzhiks. Turgenev's muzhiks have been compared to other noble savages in 19th-century fiction (such as American Indians in works by J. F. Cooper).

Early life Cleaveland was born in Canterbury, Connecticut Colony, to Colonel Aaron Cleaveland (1725‚Äì1785) and Thankful Cleaveland (1733‚Äì1822). He studied law at Yale College, graduating in 1777. He was commissioned as an ensign in the 2nd Connecticut Regiment of the Continental Army in 1777 during the American Revolution. In 1779, he was promoted to captain of a company of \\"sappers and miners\\" (combat engineers) in the newly formed Corps of Engineers. He resigned from the army on June 7, 1781, and started a legal practice in Canterbury. Militia career Cleaveland was a member of the Connecticut convention that ratified the United States Constitution. He was elected to the Connecticut General Assembly several times and was commissioned brigadier general of militia in 1796. He was a shareholder in the Connecticut Land Company which had purchased land from Connecticut located in northeastern Ohio for $1,200,000. The land was reserved to Connecticut by Congress and was initially known as New Connecticut, but it came to be known as the Western Reserve. Cleaveland was approached by the directors of the company in May 1796 and asked to lead the survey of the tract and the location of purchases. He was also responsible for the negotiations with the Indians living on the land. In June 1796, he set out from Schenectady, New York. His party was composed of 50 people, including six surveyors, a physician, a chaplain, a boatman, 37 employees, a few emigrants, and two women who accompanied their husbands. Some journeyed by land with the horses and cattle, while the main body went in boats up the Mohawk River, down the Oswego River, along the shore of Lake Ontario, and up the Niagara River, carrying their boats over the seven-mile portage at Niagara Falls. Personal life Cleaveland married Esther Champion on March 2, 1797, with whom he had four children.Case Western Reserve University. Encyclopaedia of Cleveland History. Founding of Cleveland At Buffalo, a delegation of Mohawk and Seneca Indians opposed the party's entrance into the Western Reserve, claiming it as their territory, but they waived their rights on the receipt of goods valued at $1,200. The expedition then coasted along the shore of Lake Erie and landed at the mouth of Conneaut Creek on July 4, 1796, which they named Port Independence. Nearby Indians were upset at the encroachment on their land, but they were appeased with gifts of beads and whiskey and allowed the surveys to proceed. General Cleaveland coasted along the shore with a surveying party and landed at the mouth of the Cuyahoga River on July 22, 1796. He ascended the bank and determined that the spot was a favorable site for a city, with the river on the west and Lake Erie on the north. He had it surveyed into town lots, and the employees named the place Cleaveland in his honor. There were four settlers the first year, and growth was slow initially, reaching only 150 inhabitants in 1820. Cleaveland went home to Connecticut after the 1796 expedition and never returned to Ohio or the city that bears his name. He died in Canterbury, Connecticut, where he is also buried, but a statue of him stands in the Cleaveland Public Square. The settlement of \\"Cleaveland\\" eventually became known as \\"Cleveland\\". One theory is that Cleaveland's surveying party misspelled the name on their original map. Commemorations Image:Moses Cleaveland.jpgMoses Cleaveland, statue on Public Square in downtown Cleveland.

It is one of the most acclaimed Russian novels of the 19th century. Plot Arkady Kirsanov has just graduated from the University of Petersburg and returns with a friend, Bazarov, to his father's modest estate in an outlying province of Russia. His father, Nikolay, gladly receives the two young men at his estate, called Marino, but Nikolay's brother, Pavel, soon becomes upset by the strange new philosophy called \\"nihilism\\" which the young men, especially Bazarov, advocate. Nikolay, initially delighted to have his son return home, slowly begins to feel uneasy. A certain awkwardness develops in his regard toward his son, as Arkady's radical views, much influenced by Bazarov, make Nikolay‚Äôs own beliefs feel dated. Nikolay has always tried to stay as current as possible, by doing things such as visiting his son at school so the two can stay as close as they are, but this in Nikolay's eyes has failed. To complicate this, the father has taken a servant, Fenechka, into his house to live with him and has already had a son by her, named Mitya. Arkady, however, is not troubled by the relationship: to the contrary, he openly celebrates the addition of a younger brother. The two young men stay over at Marino for some weeks, then decide to visit a relative of Arkady's in a neighboring province. There, they observe the local gentry and meet Madame Anna Sergevna Odintsova, an elegant woman of independent means, who cuts a seductively different figure from the pretentious or humdrum types of her surrounding provincial society of gentry. Both are attracted to her, and she, intrigued by Bazarov's singular manner, invites them to spend a few days at her estate, Nikolskoye. While Bazarov at first feels nothing for Anna, Arkady falls head over heels in love with her. At Nikolskoye, they also meet Katya, Anna Sergevna's sister. Although they remain for only a short period, both characters undergo significant change: their relationship with each other is especially affected, as Arkady has begun to find himself and drift from the position of Bazarov's follower. Bazarov, in particular, finds falling in love distressing because it runs against his nihilist beliefs. Eventually, prompted by Odintsova's own cautious expressions of attraction to him, he announces that he loves her. She does not respond overtly to his declaration, though she too is deeply drawn to Bazarov while finding his dismissal of feelings and the aesthetic side of existence troublesome. While Anna does have some feelings toward Bazarov, they are not akin toward love and Anna cannot open herself to him because she does not see the possibility of a good future with him. After his avowal of love, and her failure to make a similar declaration, Bazarov proceeds to his parents' home, and Arkady decides to accompany him. At Bazarov's home, they are received enthusiastically by his parents, and the traditional mores of both father and mother, who adulate their son, are portrayed with a nostalgic, idealistic description of humble people and their fast-disappearing world of simple values and virtues. Bazarov's social cynicism, invariably on display with outsiders, is still quite clear as he settles back into his own family's ambiance. Interrupting his father as he speaks to Arkady, he proves rather abrupt and still the powerful center of attention despite being around his parents. Arkady, who has delighted Bazarov's father by assuring him that his son has a brilliant future in store, in turn, reproves his friend for his brusqueness. Later, Bazarov almost comes to blows with Arkady after the latter makes a joke about fighting over Bazarov's cynicism. This once again shows the distance and changes within Arkady and Bazarov's relationship, as Arkady becomes more defiant against Bazarov's ideals. After a brief stay, much to the parents' disappointment, they decide to return to Marino, stopping on the way to see Madame Odintsova, who receives them coolly. They leave almost immediately and return to Arkady's home. Arkady remains for only a few days and makes an excuse to leave in order to go to Nikolskoye again. Once there, he realizes he is not in love with Odintsova, but instead with her sister Katya. Bazarov stays at Marino to do some scientific research, and tension between him and Pavel increases. Bazarov enjoys talking with Fenechka and playing with her child, and one day he kisses her, against her will. Pavel observes this kiss and, secretly in love with Fenechka himself and in protection of both Fenechka and Nikolay's feelings for her, challenges Bazarov to a duel. Pavel is wounded in the leg, and Bazarov must leave Marino. He stops for an hour or so at Madame Odintsova's, then continues on to his parents' home. Meanwhile, Arkady and Katya have fallen in love and have become engaged. Anna Sergevna Odinstova is hesitant to accept Arkady's request to marry her sister, but Bazarov convinces her to allow the marriage. While back at home, Bazarov changes quite drastically. Instead of focusing on his experiments he turns to help his father in being a country doctor. At home, Bazarov cannot keep his mind on his work and while performing an autopsy fails to take the proper precautions. He cuts himself and contracts blood poisoning. On his deathbed, he sends for Madame Odintsova, who arrives just in time to hear Bazarov tell her how beautiful she is. She kisses him on the forehead and leaves; Bazarov dies from his illness the following day. Arkady marries Katya and takes over the management of his father's estate. His father marries Fenechka and is delighted to have Arkady home with him. Pavel leaves the country and lives the rest of his life as a \\"noble\\" in Dresden, Germany. Major characters In order of appearance Chapter 1 * Nikol√°y Petr√≥vich Kirs√°nov ‚Äì A gentleman in his early forties, a widower, \\"quite grey now, stoutish and a trifle bent,\\" a liberal democrat, father of Ark√°dy, brother of Pavel; should have followed his father's career in the army but broke his leg on the day he was commissioned and had to go into the civil service; owns Maryino, \\"a respectable little property of his consisting of a couple of hundred serfs‚Äîor five thousand acres.\\" He is thrilled to have his son back from college. Chapter 2 * Ark√°dy Nikol√°yevich Kirs√°nov ‚Äì Son of Nikol√°y Petr√≥vich; having recently graduated from St. Petersburg University, he brings his friend of Bazarov home to Maryino. He has become a nihilist more from Bazarov's influence than from conviction. He becomes enamored of Anna Sergeyevna Odinisov, but cannot compete for her affections with his fascinating friend Bazarov. Later he falls in love with Anna Sergeyevna's quiet, modest young sister Katya and marries her. * Yevg√©ny Vas√≠levich Baz√°rov ‚Äì A medical student and nihilist, in which role he serves as a mentor to Arkady, and as a challenger to the liberal ideas of the Kirsanov brothers and the traditional Russian Orthodox feelings of his own parents. \\"A long thin face with a broad forehead...large greenish eyes and drooping, sandy whiskers ‚Äî the whole animated by a tranquil smile betokening self-assurance and intelligence.\\" He eventually dies of typhus carelessly contracted during a medical examination, accepting his fate with calm resignation. Chapter 4 * Prokofyich ‚Äì a servant of the Kirs√°novs's; \\"A man of about sixty ... white-haired, lean and dark-complexioned.\\" * P√°vel Petr√≥vich Kirs√°nov ‚Äì Nikol√°y Petr√≥vich‚Äôs brother; \\"...of medium height ... looked about forty-five ... close-cropped grey hair ... his face the colour of old ivory but without a wrinkle ... unusually regular and clean-cut features ... perfumed mustaches.\\" A bourgeois with aristocratic pretensions (\\"an exquisite pink hand having long tapering pink nails\\"), he prides himself on his refinement but, like his brother, is reform-minded. Although he recognizes Bazarov as the son of a local doctor, he detests him \\"with every fiber of his being,\\" thinking him \\"an arrogant, impudent fellow, a cynic and a vulgarian.\\" * \\"Fen√©chka\\" (Feod√≥sya Nikol√°yevna) ‚Äì \\"...a young woman of about three and twenty with a soft white skin, dark hair and eyes, red childishly-pouting lips and small delicate hands.\\" Daughter of the late housekeeper at Maryino with whom Nikol√°y Petr√≥vich has fallen in love and fathered a son, named Mitya; Arkady welcomes having a little half-brother. The implied obstacles to marriage are difference in class, and perhaps Nikol√°y Petr√≥vich's previous marriage ‚Äî the burden of 'traditionalist' values. Chapter 12 * Matvei Ilyich Kolyazin ‚Äì A cousin of the Kirsanov brothers who serves as the inspector of the provincial governor in a nearby town. He is pompous and self-important but \\"he was always being made a fool of, and any moderately experienced official could twist him round his finger.\\" * V√≠ktor S√≠tnikov ‚Äì A pompous and foolhardy friend of Bazarov who joins populist ideals and groups. Like Arkady, he is heavily influenced by Bazarov in his ideals. \\"I appreciate the comforts of life...but that doesn't prevent me from being a liberal.\\" Chapter 13 * Avd√≥tya (Yevdoks√≠ya) Nikit√≠shna K√∫kshina ‚Äì An emancipated woman who lives in the town where Matvei Ilyich is posted. Kukshina is independent but rather eccentric and incapable as a proto-feminist, despite her potential. Chapter 14 * √Ånna Serg√©yevna Od√≠ntsova ‚Äì A wealthy widow, 29 years old, who entertains the nihilist friends at her estate; \\"...rather a strange person. Having no prejudices of any kind, and no strong convictions even, she was not put off by obstacles and she had no goal in life...Arkady decided he had never yet met such a fascinating woman. The sound of her voice haunted his ears...her every movement was wonderfully flowing and natural.\\" However, the young Arkady does not fascinate her the way the worldly Bazarov does. They experience a rift, but she hurries to his bedside upon hearing that he's dying. Chapter 16 * Yekater√≠na (K√°tya) Serg√©yevna L√≥kteva ‚Äì The younger sister of Anna: \\"...a girl of eighteen with black hair, an olive complexion, a rather round but pleasing face and small dark eyes.\\" She lives comfortably with her sister but lacks confidence, finding it hard to escape Anna Sergeevna's shadow. This shyness makes her and Arkady‚Äôs love slow to realize itself. * The Princess ‚Äì √Ånna Serg√©yevna's aunt, \\"...a small shriveled woman with a clenched fist of a face and glaring spiteful eyes under a grey wig...\\" Rude and overbearing but essentially ignored by the household. Chapter 20 * Vas√≠ly Iv√°novich Baz√°rov ‚Äì Bazarov‚Äôs father. A retired army surgeon, and a small countryside land/serf holder. Educated and enlightened, he nonetheless feels, like many of the characters, that rural isolation has left him out of touch with modern ideas. He thus retains loyalty to traditionalist ways, manifested particularly in devotion to God and to his son Yevgeny. \\"'A comical old chap with a heart of gold',\\" in his son's words. * Ar√≠na Vl√°sevna Baz√°rova ‚Äì Bazarov‚Äôs mother. A very traditional woman of the 15th-century Moscovy style aristocracy and a pious follower of Orthodox Christianity, woven with folk tales and falsehoods. She loves her son deeply but is also terrified of him and his rejection of all beliefs. Historical context and notes The fathers and children of the novel refers to the growing divide between the two generations of Russians, and the character Yevgeny Bazarov, a nihilist who rejects the old order. Turgenev wrote Fathers and Sons as a response to the growing cultural schism that he saw between liberals of the 1830s/1840s and the growing nihilist movement. Both the nihilists (the \\"sons\\") and the 1830s liberals (the \\"fathers\\") sought Western-based social change in Russia. Additionally, these two modes of thought were contrasted with the Slavophiles, who believed that Russia's path lay in its traditional spirituality. Turgenev's novel was responsible for popularizing the use of the term nihilism, which became widely used after the novel was published. Fathers and Sons might be regarded as the first wholly modern novel in Russian literature (Gogol's Dead Souls, another main contender, was referred to by the author as a poem or epic in prose as in the style of Dante's Divine Comedy, and was at any rate never completed). The novel introduces a dual character study, as seen with the gradual breakdown of Bazarov's and Arkady's nihilistic opposition to emotional display, especially in the case of Bazarov's love for Madame Odintsova. The novel is also the first Russian work to gain prominence in the Western world, eventually gaining the approval of well established novelists Gustave Flaubert, Guy de Maupassant, and Henry James. The Bolshevik revolutionary Vladimir Bazarov adopted his pseudonym from the character of Yevgeny Bazarov in this novel. Adaptations Canadian playwright George F.

After its demobilization it became a political party, the M-19 Democratic Alliance (Alianza Democr√°tica M-19), or AD/M-19. The M-19 traced its origins to the allegedly fraudulent presidential elections of 19 April 1970. In those elections, the National Popular Alliance (ANAPO) of former military dictator Gustavo Rojas Pinilla was denied an electoral victory. The ideology of the M-19 was nationalism, but its main aim was to open up democracy in Colombia. It was inspired by other South American urban guerrilla groups, such as the Tupamaros in Uruguay and the Montoneros in Argentina. By mid-1985, when the number of active members was estimated at between 1,500 and 2,000 (including a more noticeable urban presence), the M-19 was the second largest guerrilla group in Colombia after the FARC. On 27 June 2017, FARC ceased to be an armed group, disarming itself and handing over its weapons to the United Nations. Armed activity The M-19's history may be divided into two parts: the first was a failed armed revolutionary struggle during the early to mid-1980s, while the second was a relatively constructive reincorporation into civil society and political life during the late 1980s and early 1990s. Among the actions performed by the M-19, some significant events stand out. In a highly symbolic action, the M-19 stole one of Sim√≥n Bol√≠var's swords from a museum in 1974, an event which was used by the group to symbolize what they called a civilian uprising against a regime perceived as unjust. On New Year's Eve 1979, the group dug a tunnel into a Colombian Army weapons depot, taking over 5000 weapons. It was considered one of the first signs of the group's true potential for armed action. In February 1976, the M-19 kidnapped the union leader Jose Raquel Mercado, who was the president of Confederation of Workers of Colombia (CTC), and on 19 April 1976, executed him. The event shocked the country. The group accused Mercado of taking bribes and collaborating with the CIA. =Dominican Republic embassy siege= The group is also recognized for other high-profile activities, such as the Dominican embassy siege. The guerrillas stormed the Dominican Republic's embassy during a cocktail party on 27 February 1980. They took the largest recorded number of diplomats held hostage to date in Colombia, which accounted for 14 ambassadors, including the United States'. Eventually, after tense negotiations with the government of Julio C√©sar Turbay Ayala, the hostages were peacefully released and the hostage takers were allowed to leave the country for exile in Cuba. Some of them later returned and actively rejoined the M-19's activities. Many contemporary rumors and later accounts from the participants in this event have suggested that the Colombian government might have submitted to another of the M-19 demands, by allegedly giving the group 1 to 2.5 million U.S. dollars in exchange for the release of the hostages.  First peace talks  During the government of Belisario Betancur (1982‚Äì1986), Jaime Bateman Cay√≥n, by then top leader of the M-19, proposed a meeting in Panama with the Colombian government toward solving the conflict. But Bateman died on 28 April 1983 in an airplane accident, apparently while on the way to Panama, and the negotiations were suspended. The negotiations culminated with the Agreements of Corinto, Cauca. A ceasefire was agreed, as well as the continuation of dialogue for the future demobilization of the guerrilla detachment. Nevertheless, sectors of the army opposed to the agreements of La Uribe and Corinto were responsible for attacks against the life of main leaders Iv√°n Marino Ospina, Antonio Navarro Wolff, Carlos Pizarro, Marcos Chalita, etc. =Palace of Justice siege= The M-19, as a guerrilla group, is also recognized for the Palace of Justice siege. In this attack, on 6 November 1985, some 300 lawyers, judges, and Supreme Court magistrates were taken hostage by 35 armed rebel commandos at the Palace of Justice, the building that houses the Supreme Court of Colombia. They demanded that president Belisario Betancur be tried by the magistrates for allegedly betraying the country's desire for peace. When this situation became publicly known, the Colombian Army surrounded the Palace of Justice's perimeter with soldiers and EE-9 Cascavel armored reconnaissance vehicles. For a short while, unsuccessful negotiations were attempted, but they reached nowhere, despite the desperate pleas that were transmitted telephonically by some of the notable hostages involved. The Betancur administration and its council found themselves in a difficult position. They were not willing to submit to the rebels' demands, as they allegedly considered that this would set a further precedent for the M-19 and considerably jeopardize the government's position. Eventually, after tense discussions, it was decided during an emergency meeting that the military would be allowed to handle the situation and attempt to recover the Palace by force. This led to a highly controversial turn of events which, to a lesser or greater degree, continues to be debated in Colombia to this date. In the ensuing heavy crossfire between the incoming soldiers and the entrenched rebels, which included supporting gunfire from the EE-9 Cascavels, the building was set aflame, more than 100 people died (including 11 of the country's 21 Supreme Court Justices), and valuable legal records were destroyed. The M-19 lost several of its top commanders during the event, and blamed the government for the ensuing bloodshed. The surviving civilian victims and their families held different positions; some blamed the M-19, some blamed the Betancur administration, many blamed both. There is apparently no clear consensus on the matter. Author Ana Carrigan alleged against the widely accepted version that drug lords, such as Pablo Escobar, may have masterminded the operation in order to get rid of several criminal investigations recorded in the documents lost during the event. A Special Commission of Inquiry, established by the Betancur government, released a June 1986 report which concluded that Escobar had no relation with this event, so these allegations could not be proven (though it did not rule out the possibility either). Carrigan alleged that the act was a conspiracy of the Colombian government. p. 279 Others state that the alleged Guerrilla-Cartel relation was unlikely to occur because the two organizations had several standoffs and confrontations, like the kidnapping of Nieves Ochoa, the sister of Medellin cartel founder Juan David Ochoa, by M-19. The kidnapping led to the creation of the MAS/Muerte a Secuestradores (\\"Death to Kidnappers\\") paramilitary group by the Medellin cartel. However, her conspiracy theories and skepticism of Escobar and the Medellin Cartel's involvement was greatly discredited by others such as Rex Hudson, who presented allegedly \\"overwhelming evidence\\" linking the cartel to the plot.Colombia‚Äôs Palace of Justice tragedy revisited: a critique of the conspiracy theory, Terrorism and Political Violence [Peer Reviewed Journal], Volume 7, Issue 2, 1995. Rex A. Hudson. Pages 93-142 at 103. Former Assistant of the Colombia Attorney General, National Deputy Comptroller, author and Professor Jose Mauricio Gaona along with Former Minister of Justice and Ambassador to the United Kingdom Carlos Medell√≠n Becerra, the sons of two of the murdered Supreme Court magistrates, have pushed for further investigations into the presumed links between the M-19 and the Medell√≠n Cartel drug lords. Mayor of Bogota Gustavo Petro, a former M-19 guerrilla, has denied these accusations and dismissed them as based upon the inconsistent testimonies of drug lords. Petro says that the surviving members of the M-19 do admit to their share of responsibility for the tragic events of the siege, on behalf of the entire organization, but deny any links to the drug trade.  Demobilization and participation in politics  New banner adopted by the Democratic Alliance M-19. Internationally isolated, M-19 saw itself unable to continue the armed struggle: As late as 1988, an attempt was made to solicit weapons shipments from Socialist East Germany, but, following reservations from the Ministry of National Defense, the Foreign Ministry, and the Ministry for State Security, the request was denied in the end.General of the Army Heinz Ke√üler, Minister for National Defense of the GDR, described the M-19 as \\"a radical leftist movement with a partially bizarre orientation\\", citing additional reservations that the movement might be irredeemably subverted by western intelligence agencies. See Klaus Storkmann: Geheime Solidarit√§t: Milit√§rbeziehungen und Milit√§rhilfen der DDR in die \\"Dritte Welt\\", Berlin 2012, p. 119. The M-19 eventually gave up its weapons, received pardons and became a political party in the late 1980s, the M-19 Democratic Alliance (\\"Alianza Democr√°tica M-19\\", or (AD/M-19)), which renounced the armed struggle. Eventually the M-19 returned Bol√≠var's sword as a symbol of its demobilization and desire to change society through its participation in legal politics. In 1990, one of its more prominent figures, presidential candidate and former guerrilla commander Carlos Pizarro Leong√≥mez, while aboard an airline flight, was murdered by assassins, supposedly on the orders of drug cartel and paramilitary leaders (disappeared AUC commander Carlos Casta√±o publicly admitted his own responsibility for the murder in a 2002 book and interviews). Some of its other members were also subject to multiple threats or likewise murdered. Antonio Navarro Wolff replaced the deceased Pizarro as candidate and leader of the party, finishing third in that year's presidential race. Despite the continuation of smaller scale violence against it, the AD/M-19 survived through the 1990s, achieved favorable electoral results on a local level and actively participated as a high-profile political force in the forging of Colombia's modern 1991 constitution, which replaced a conservative document ostensibly dating from 1886. Antonio Navarro was one of the three co- presidents of the Constituent Assembly of Colombia, together with representatives from the Colombian Liberal Party and the Colombian Conservative Party. Several analysts consider that the AD/M-19 reached its peak at this point in time and, while never disappearing completely from the political background, it began to gradually decline as a party on its own, although many of its ex-members have gained influence in the Independent Democratic Pole coalition.

As of the 2008 census, the commune had a population of 39,409 people, up from 32,940 in 1998, and an annual growth rate of 1.8%. Touggourt's urban area includes the communes of Nezla, Tebesbest and Zaouia El Abidia, for a total population of 146,108. Touggourt is notable for its date trees. It was formerly surrounded by a moat, which the French filled up. Bradt Travel Guides describe it as \\"largely a modern town of block architecture\\" and \\"largely unattractive. The centre is quiet most of the day due to the heat but is more active at night when people take to the streets.\\"  History  In 1414 the Sultanate of Tuggert was founded in southern Algeria. The known Sultans (and one Sultana) were: *Ali II *Mabruk (Mubarak) *Ali III *Mustafa *Sulayman III *1729 Ahmad II *Muhammad I al-\`Akhal *Ahmad IV *Farhat *Ibrahim *Abd al-Qadir I (1st time) + Ahmad V *Khalid *Abd al-Qadir I (2nd time) *Umar bin Bu-Kumetin *1756 Muhammad II *Umar II bin Muhammad *Ahmad VI *Abd al-Qadir II *Farhat II *1792 Ibrahim II *1804 al-Khazan *1804 Muhammad III *1822 \`Amar (\`Amir) II *1830 Ibrahim III *1831 \`Ali IV bin al-Kabir *1833 \`Aisha (Aichouch)(female) *1840 \`Abd ar-Rahman *1852 \`Abd al-Qadir III *1852 - 1854 Sulayman IV The Tuggurt Expedition (1552) is also a notable historical event. In 1854 the sultanate was abolished by French colonial authorities in Algeria. Touggourt, as it is now spelled, became one of the initial six (1902), then four (1905) autonomous administrative districts of the ' (Southern Territories), which in 1957 were first joined, then reorganized into two regular French d√©partements. Tuggert became part of Oasis (prefecture seat Ouargla).  Geography  Touggourt lies on the western side of an extensive system of oases which supports palm plantations and other agriculture in an area from north to south. Other towns around the oases are Sidi Slimane and Megarine to north, and Tamacine and Balidat Ameur to the south. The system is also associated with more oases further north in El Oued Province including the towns of Djamaa and El M'Ghair. Beyond the oases, the land is arid and barren, with extensive sand dunes both to the west and east of the city.  Climate  Touggourt has a hot desert climate (K√∂ppen climate classification BWh), with long, extremely hot summers and short, warm winters. Average high temperatures are consistently over 40 ¬∞C (104 ¬∞F) during June, July, August and September and reach a maximum of nearly 45 ¬∞C (113 ¬∞F) in July. Average low temperatures in summer are also very high, above 26 ¬∞C (82.4 ¬∞F) and routinely above 29 ¬∞C (86 ¬∞F) in the hottest month. Average annual rainfall is around 55 mm (2,16 in) and summers are especially dry.  Transportation  Touggourt lies at the junction of the N3 and N16 roads, northeast of the provincial capital of Ouargla. It is connected by railway to Biskra and is served by the Sidi Madhi Airport. The N3 highway connects to Megarine, Sidi Slimane, and Biskra to the north and Hassi Messaoud and Illizi to the south. The N16 connects to Taibet and El Oued to the east. Another road, the Route Messaad Tougourt, connects to Messa√¢d and Djelfa to the northwest. Local roads connect to nearby towns Megarine and Tamacine.  Localities  Touggourt in January 1913 Touggourt in January 1913 The commune is composed of nine localities: *Quartier de Mestaoua *Sidi Abdessalem *Baalouche *Chateau d'eau *Emir Abdelkader *La gare *Sidi Bouaziz *Zone Industrielle *Nouvelle Zone d'Activit√©  References  Sources and external links * WorldStatesmen - Algeria - Tuggert Neighbouring towns and cities Category:Oases of Algeria Category:Communes of Ouargla Province Category:History of the Sahara Category:Cities in Algeria ","title":"Touggourt"},{"id":"1245751","text":"Pinus orizabensis, the Orizaba pinyon, is a pine in the pinyon pine group, endemic to central Mexico. It is considered also as a sub-species of Pinus cembroides which is classified as Pinus cembroides subsp. orizabensis D.K.Bailey. It has larger seeds than the type. The range is localised, confined to a small area in the eastern Eje Volc√°nico Transversal range (Trans-Mexican Volcanic Belt), in the states of Puebla and Veracruz. It occurs at high altitudes, mostly from , in a cooler, moister climate than the other pinyon pines. Description It is a small to medium-size tree, reaching tall and with a trunk diameter of up to 50 cm. The bark is dark brown, thick and deeply fissured at the base of the trunk. The leaves ('needles') are in mixed fascicles of three and four, slender, 3‚Äì6 cm long, and deep green to blue- green, with stomata confined to a bright white band on the inner surfaces. =Cones= The cones are globose to ovoid, 4‚Äì7 cm long and 3‚Äì5 cm broad when closed, green at first, ripening yellow-brown when 16‚Äì18 months old, with only a small number of thin scales, typically 6-18 fertile scales. The cones open to 5‚Äì7 cm broad when mature, holding the seeds on the scales after opening. The seeds are 12‚Äì15 mm long, with a thick shell, a pink endosperm, and a vestigial 2 mm wing; they are dispersed by the Mexican jay, which plucks the seeds out of the open cones. The jay, which uses the seeds as a major food resource, stores many of the seeds for later use, and some of these stored seeds are not used and are able to grow into new trees. History Pinus orizabensis is the most recent pinyon pine to be described, discovered by Dana K. Bailey in 1983 when examining an unusual pinyon cultivated at the Royal Botanic Gardens, Kew; it was found to match wild specimens from the Pico de Orizaba. At first it was described as a subspecies of Mexican pinyon, but further research by Bailey & Hawksworth and others has shown that it is better treated as a distinct species. Some botanists still include it in Mexican pinyon though, despite their occurring together in some sites without evidence of hybridisation. Orizaba pinyon shows better adaptation to rainy temperate climate like England than Pinus cembroides which grows in dryer habitats. Pinus orizabensis is most closely allied to Johann's pinyon and Potosi pinyon, with which it shares the leaf structure with the stomata confined to the inner faces; it differs from these in the larger cones and seeds, and from the latter in fewer needles per fascicle (3-4 vs 5). Like these two, the white- glaucous inner surfaces of the needles make it a very attractive small tree, suitable for parks and large gardens. The edible (pine nut) seeds are collected in Mexico to a small extent.

It was originally a Latin legal term for \\"[a condition] without which it could not be\\", or \\"but for...\\" or \\"without which [there is] nothing\\". \\"Sine qua non causation\\" is the formal terminology for \\"but-for causation\\". Origin and spread As a Latin term, it occurs in the work of Boethius, and originated in Aristotelian expressions. In Classical Latin, the form uses the word (from the verb , , to agree upon), but in later Latin the phrase is also used with , an error in translation as means construction and not condition. It has passed from a merely legal usage to a more general usage in many languages, including English, German, French, Italian and Spanish. General usages Andrew Jackson, an early American president, gave a toast on the occasion of his receiving an honorary doctorate from Harvard University. The President responded to his listeners, \\"E pluribus unum, my friends. Sine qua non\\".2005 biography by H. W. Brands In 1938 Jomo Kenyatta, then general secretary of the Kikuyu Central Association and later Kenya's first prime minister, wrote that the institution of female genital mutilation was the \\"condicio sine qua non of the whole teaching of tribal law, religion and morality\\". He was writing in the context of the missionaries' campaign against FGM, asserting the importance of the rite of passage as an ethnic marker for the Kikuyu, the country's main ethnic group.Jomo Kenyatta, Facing Mount Kenya, New York: Vintage Books, 1962 [1938], pages 127-129 The phrase appears in the 1967 book on Dahomey culture by Melville J. Herskovits. In writing about the need to learn the native language, he says, \\"This does not mean that a knowledge of a native language is a Sine qua non in the study of all problems bearing on primitive cultures. By the use of interpreters and of well recognized and tested techniques, it is possible to obtain the information needed to discover, describe and understand the institutions of a people, and it is such technique that have been employed in this study.\\" It appears in the 1958 commentary on Article 59 of the Fourth Geneva Convention on the protection of civilians during a time of war. In this case, the sine qua non refers to the assurance that relief aid will go to the civilian population and not be diverted toward \\"the benefit of the Occupying Power\\". Usage in medicine In medicine, the term sine qua non (contrast with pathognomonic) is often used in regard to any sign, symptom, or finding whose absence would very likely mean absence of the target disease or condition. The test for such a sign, symptom or finding would thereby have very high sensitivity, and rarely miss the condition, so a negative result should be reassuring (the disease tested for is absent). Examples include: *The absence of finding the corresponding underlying mutation excludes certain types of hereditary colon cancer. *A vaginal pH of less than 4.5 practically excludes bacterial vaginosis. *Sine qua non was the inspiration behind a brand name of a tricyclic antidepressant manufactured in Germany: (Sinequan) doxepin. \\"But-for\\" causation in law In legal matters, \\"but-for\\", \\"sine qua non\\", causa sine qua non, or \\"cause-in- fact\\" causation, or condicio sine qua non, is a circumstance in which a certain act is a material cause of a certain injury or wrongdoing, without which the injury would not have occurred. It is established by the \\"but-for\\" test: but for the act having occurred, the injury would not have happened. The defendant's negligent conduct is the actual cause of the plaintiff's injury if the harm would not have occurred to the plaintiff \\"but for\\" the negligent conduct of the defendant. (Perkins) This type of causation is often contrasted with substantial-factor causation. The substantial factor test is used when there are multiple negligent tortfeasors which either (1) all caused the injury, in which case any and all of them are 100% joint and severally liable (treated as the group but suing the money) and the charged defendant would have to implead or sue the others to square the damages, or (2) only one could have actually caused the injury but they were all negligent in the same way and that one cannot be determined, in which case the burden shifts and any of them that cannot show their negligence was not the cause is 100% joint and severally liable. The purpose of this is allow the aggrieved party to get their damages, and make the negligent tortfeasors square up amongst themselves. See e.g. Hill v. Edmonds, (N.Y., 1966); Anderson v. Minneapolis, St. P. & S. St. M. Ry. Co., (Minn., 1920) In Rogers v. Bromac Title Servs. LLC, the U.S. 5th Circuit interpreted the language of the Jury System Improvement Act in prohibiting employers from terminating employees \\"by reason of\\" jury service as meaning \\"but-for\\" causation: the employee must show that the termination of employment would not have occurred \\"but for\\" that jury service. This is a higher burden for the plaintiff employee than merely showing that the jury service was a motivating factor for the termination.http://www.shrm.org/legalissues/federalresources/pages/jury- service-but-for-causation.aspx See also * Proximate cause * Causation * Four causes * Raison d'√™tre * List of Latin phrases References Category:Latin legal terminology Category:Latin medical words and phrases Category:Latin political words and phrases Category:Latin philosophical phrases ","title":"Sine qua non"},{"id":"1245772","text":"The German Wikipedia () is the German-language edition of Wikipedia, a free and publicly editable online encyclopedia.

Opponents of the reformation were concerned about the restriction of fundamental rights including a free press and the freedom of speech and arts.  Early history  The German edition of Wikipedia was the first non-English Wikipedia subdomain, and was originally named . Its creation was announced by Jimmy Wales on 16 March 2001. One of the earliest snapshots of the home page, dated 21 March 2001 (revision #9), can be seen at the Wayback Machine site.Internet Archive's snapshots of German Wikipedia HomePage, 21 March 2001 12:10 (revision #9), and related revision history. Retrieved 4 November 2008. Aside from the home page, creation of articles in the German Wikipedia started as early as April 2001, apparently with translations of Nupedia articles.\\"Nupedia German-L Section\\" (6 April 2001), \\"Vergil\\" (16 April 2001),\\"Pylos\\" (17 April 2001). The earliest article still available on Wikipedia's site is apparently Polymerase-Kettenreaktion, dated May 2001.\\"Polymerase-Kettenreaktion\\" article on German Wiki showing edit dated May 2001 Andrew Lih wrote that the hacker culture in Germany and the verein concept solidified the German Wikipedia's culture. The geography of Europe facilitated face-to-face meetups among German Wikipedians.Lih, p. 147.  Growth, coverage and popularity  Article growth, 2001 - December 2016 On 27 December 2009, the German Wikipedia edition exceeded 1,000,000 articles,Statistics of German Wikipedia (English) becoming the first edition after the English-language Wikipedia to do so.

In the middle of 2009 this edition had nearly 250,000 biographies and in December 2006 more than 48,500 disambiguations.29 December 2006 Compared to the English Wikipedia, the German edition tends to be more selective in its coverage, often rejecting small stubs, articles about individual fictional characters and similar materials. Instead, there is usually one article about all the characters from a specific fictional setting, usually only when the setting is considered important enough (for example, all characters from Star Wars are listed in a single article). A dedicated article about a single fictional entity generally exists only if the character in question has a very significant impact on popular culture (for example, Hercule Poirot). Andrew Lih wrote that German Wikipedia users believe that \\"having no article at all is better than a very bad article.\\"Lih, p. 148. Therefore, growth on the German Wikipedia leveled before it did for the English Wikipedia, with accelerating growth in article count shifting to constant growth in mid-2006. The number of users signing up for accounts began to steadily decline in 2007 through 2008. The January 2005, Google Zeitgeist announced that \\"Wikipedia\\" was the eighth most-searched query on www.google.de.

These however, have less popularity than the German Wikipedia.Wikipedia statistics There are also the Dutch Low Saxon (:nds-nl:) and the Mennonite Low German Wikipedia.  Characteristics  Daily requests for deletion, de facto deleted articles and the ratio of these two values The German Wikipedia is different from the English Wikipedia in a number of aspects. * Compared to the English Wikipedia, different criteria of encyclopedic notability are expressed through the judgments of the editors for deciding if an article about a topic should be allowed. The criteria for notability are more specific, each field has its own specific guidelines. * There are no fair use provisions. Images and other media that are accepted on the English Wikipedia as fair use may not be suitable for the German Wikipedia. However, the threshold of originality for works of applied art is set much higher, which often allows the use of company logos and similar icons, too. * The use of scholarly sources, in preference over journalistic and other types of sources, is more strongly encouraged. The German Verifiability (Belege) guideline classifies scholarly sources as inherently more reliable than non-academic sources; the latter's use is ‚Äì in theory at least ‚Äì only permitted if there is a lack of published academic sources covering a topic.Wikipedia:Belege * In September 2005, Erik M√∂ller voiced concern that \\"long term page protection is used excessively on the German Wikipedia\\":Erik M√∂ller: Wikipedia page protection report Wikitech-l mailing list, 14 September 2005 on 14 September 2005, 253 pages were fully protected (only editable by admins) for more than two weeks (compared to 138 in the English Wikipedia). This was the highest number of such blocks of all Wikipedias. , the German Wikipedia still had the highest percentage of semi- protected articles - 0.281% - among the ten largest Wikipedias (articles not editable by unsubscribed or recently subscribed users), but with respect to the fraction of fully protected articles (0.0261%) it actually ranks fourth, behind the Japanese, Portuguese and English Wikipedias.Tim 'avatar' Bartel: Entsperrung der Wikipedia WikiDE-l mailing list, 28 May 2008 07:45:55 GMT * Vandalism and other abuse is often handled in a less formal way. Vandals may get blocked on their first edit and without warning if their edit clearly shows lack of interest for actual encyclopaedic work. This is especially true if the added text includes unlawful statements, such as holocaust denial. Similarly, the Checkuser function is rarely used to determine multiple accounts, as \\"suspicious\\" accounts are often blocked on sight. * Articles on indisputably notable subjects may be deleted if they are deemed too short. While the requirements for minimal articles (called stubs) are equivalent, the German and the English Wikipedia differ greatly in the way they are put into practice.Wikipedia:Stub, :de:Wikipedia:Stub * On 28 December 2005, it was decided to eliminate the Category \\"stub\\" (and the corresponding template identifying articles as stubs) from the German Wikipedia.German Wikipedia:Poll about the abolishment of the stub template, 28 December 2005 * Users do not have to create an account in order to start a new article. * Unlike the Cebuano, Polish, Dutch, Italian, Swedish or many other Wikipedias, the German one does not contain large collections of bot-generated geographical stubs or similar articles. * The German Wikipedia version did not have an Arbitration Committee until May 2007. Currently, German Wikipedia's Arbitration Committee plays only a minor role in Wikipedia politics. * Categories are singular and are not differentiated for gender. Categories are usually introduced only for a minimum of ten entries and are not always subdivided even for larger numbers of items, so that current categories often describe only one property (e.g., nationality). Other categories are subdivided, but differently from in the English Wikipedia. For example, \\"chemists\\" are subdivided by century, not by nationality. A university professor, on the other hand, will usually be categorized according to where he or she teaches. * The equivalent to the English Wikipedia's featured articles and good articles are exzellente Artikel (excellent articles) and lesenswerte Artikel (good articles; literally: articles \\"worth reading\\"). * In 2005, there was a discussion and poll resulting in the decision to phase out the use of local image uploads and to exclusively use Wikimedia Commons for images and other media in the future.German Wikipedia: Poll about uploading images exclusively in Wikimedia Commons The attempt to implement this lasted for about a year and the German \\"Upload file\\" page displayed a large pointer to Commons in this time, but since December 2006, there is again a local image upload page without any pointer to Wikimedia Commons. This was prompted by the deletion of images on Commons that are acceptable according to German Wikipedia policies.German Wikipedia: Question regarding image upload and Wikimedia Commons * Starting in December 2004, German Wikipedians pioneered Persondata (\\"Personendaten\\"), a special format for meta data about persons (name, birth date and place etc.), introduced in the English Wikipedia in December 2005. In the beginning, the main aim of this system was to aid the search features of the DVD edition of the German Wikipedia (see below). During its introduction in January 2005, Personendaten were added to some 30,000 biographical articles on the live Wikipedia, partly aided by a somewhat automatic tool. The template is currently deprecated and is no longer on any pages.Jakob Voss: Metadata with Personendaten and beyond (presentation at Wikimania 2005) * Like The Signpost in the English Wikipedia, the German Wikipedia also has its own internal newspaper, the Kurier. However, the Kurier is laid out on a single page and is not issued weekly but is continually updated by interested Wikipedians, with older articles being archived. * In German Wikipedia is pronounced [Àåv…™kiÀàpeÀêdia]. = Reviewed versions = At Wikimania 2006, Jimmy Wales announced that the German Wikipedia would soon institute a system of \\"stable article versions\\", also known as sighting, on a trial basis. The system went live in May 2008. Certain users, so-called \\"active sighters\\", are now able to mark article versions as \\"reviewed\\", indicating that the text contains no obvious vandalism. A note in the top right corner of the screen indicates to the reader whether or not the present version of an article has already been reviewed, and provides access to the most recent reviewed version or a more current, unreviewed version as needed.  Miscellanea  The Exhibition \\"Five Years of Wikipedia\\" at the G√∂ttingen University library, March 2006 = Events = The first real-life meetup of Wikipedians took place in October 2003 in Munich. As a result of this meeting regularly striking round tables (called ‚ÄúWikipedia-Stammtisch‚Äù) established themselves at various places in Germany, Austria and Switzerland. The round tables have become an important aspect of collegial exchange within the German-speaking community.German Wikipedia: Round tables Each spring and autumn, the German Wikipedia organizes a writing contest, where a community-elected jury rates nominated articles. Prizes are sponsored by individual community members and companies. The first contest was held in October 2004 - the article Kloster Lehnin (Lehnin Abbey) was selected as the winner from 44 nominated articles. The second contest, held in March 2005, saw 52 contributions, and the third, in September 2005, 70. A trial to extend the contest to an international level met with limited success, with only the Dutch, English and Japanese Wikipedias participating.International writing contest, March 2005. For the March 2006 writing contest, the 150 nominated articles were split into three sections: history and society (56 nominations), arts and humanities (36), and science (46). The article on the Brown Bear (German: Braunb√§r) won, and of the nominated 27 articles reached featured status a few weeks after the contest.Writing contest In March 2007, the sixth contest was held, with the winner being the article on the Hague Convention for the Protection of Cultural Property in the Event of Armed Conflict (German: Haager Konvention zum Schutz von Kulturgut bei bewaffneten Konflikten). German Wikipedians organized the first international Wikipedia conference, Wikimania 2005, in August 2005 in Frankfurt. Some 300 people from over 50 countries attended the three-day conference. From 17 March to 15 April 2006, the G√∂ttingen State and University Library held a special exhibition documenting the first five years of Wikipedia.Exhibition \\"F√ºnf Jahre Wikipedia, exhibition charts and photos In 2006, the University of G√∂ttingen hosted the first Wikipedia Academy. The Academy was intended to familiarize the academic world with Wikimedia projects. In 2007, the second such meeting took place, organized in conjunction with the Akademie der Wissenschaften und der Literatur (Academy of Science and Literature) in Mainz as part of the German Jahr der Geisteswissenschaften (Year of the Humanities), which was decreed by the German Federal Ministry for Education and Research. A third meeting was organized on 20‚Äì21 June 2008 in Berlin, during the Jahr der Mathematik (Year of Mathematics); the meeting was hosted by the Berlin- Brandenburg Academy of Sciences and Humanities.Wikipedia Academy web site German Wikipedians have since organised the Foto-Workshop meeting of photographers, with participants from 10 countries. = Contacts with Brockhaus = In April 2004, a complete list of article titles from the leading German encyclopedia Brockhaus was uploaded to the German Wikipedia, in an apparent attempt to facilitate the creation of still missing articles. A representative of Brockhaus asked for and obtained the deletion of what was believed to be a copyright infringement. As a result of the developing email conversation, a group of five Wikipedians visited the \\"new media\\" group of Brockhaus in Mannheim on 1 July 2004.Report: Wikipedia meets Brockhaus The friendly meeting saw a lively discussion of the differing approaches to writing an encyclopedia; it became clear that Brockhaus had closely observed Wikipedia for quite some time. = Subsidies from the German government = In June 2007, a project on renewable resources (WikiProjekt Nachwachsende Rohstoffe) was initiated,nova-Institut (26 June 2007): Nachwachsende Rohstoffe in die Wikipedia!

A second test by c't in February 2007 used 150 search terms, of which 56 were closely evaluated, to compare four digital encyclopedias: Bertelsmann Enzyklop√§die 2007, Brockhaus Multimedial premium 2007, Encarta 2007 Enzyklop√§die and Wikipedia. With respect to concerns about the reliability of Wikipedia, it concluded: \\"We did not find more errors in the texts of the free encyclopedia than in those of its commercial competitors\\".Dorothee Wiegand: \\"Entdeckungsreise. Digitale Enzyklop√§dien erkl√§ren die Welt\\". c't 6/2007, 5 March 2007, p. 136-145. Original quote: \\"Wir haben in den Texten der freien Enzyklop√§die nicht mehr Fehler gefunden als in denen der kommerziellen Konkurrenz\\" In December 2007, German magazine Stern published the results of a comparison between the German Wikipedia and the online version of the 15-volume edition of Brockhaus Enzyklop√§die. The test was commissioned to a research institute (Cologne-based WIND GmbH), whose analysts assessed 50 articles from each encyclopedia (covering politics, business, sports, science, culture, entertainment, geography, medicine, history and religion) on four criteria (accuracy, completeness, timeliness and clarity), and judged Wikipedia articles to be more accurate on average (1.6 on a scale from 1 to 6, versus 2.3 for Brockhaus with lower = better). Wikipedia's coverage was also found to be more complete and up to date, however Brockhaus was judged to be more clearly written, while several Wikipedia articles were criticized as being too complicated for non- experts, and many as too lengthy.Wikipedia: Wissen f√ºr alle.

Jones: German Wikipedia Outranks Traditional Encyclopedia's Online Version. InformationWeek, 7 December 2007  Off-line publication  = CD November 2004 = In November 2004, Directmedia Publishing GmbH started distributing a CD-ROM containing a German Wikipedia snapshot. Some 40,000 CDs were sent to registered customers of directmedia. The price was 3 euros per CD. The display and search software used for the project, Digibib, had been developed by Directmedia Publishing for earlier publications; it ran on Windows and Mac OS X (and now also on Linux). The Wikipedia articles had to be converted to the XML format used by Digibib. To produce the CD, a dump of the live Wikipedia had been copied to a separate server, where a team of 70 Wikipedians vetted the material, deleting nonsense articles and obvious copyright violations. Questionable articles were added to a special list, to be reviewed later. The final CD contained 132,000 articles and 1,200 images. The ISO image was distributed for free via eMule and BitTorrent. In December, the CHIP computer magazine placed the Wikipedia data on the DVD that it distributes with every issue. The Wikipedia materials are published under GFDL while the Digibib software may only be copied for non-commercial use, except the Linux version which is GPLed. = CD/DVD April 2005 = DVD Label of German off-line Wikipedia publication. A new release of Wikipedia content was published by Directmedia on 6 April 2005. This package consisted of a 2.7 GB DVD and a separate bootable CDROM (running a version of Linux with Firefox). The CDROM did not contain all the data, but was included to accommodate users without DVD-drives. The DVD used Directmedia's Digibib software and article format; everything could be installed to a hard drive. In addition, the DVD contained an HTML tree, as well as Wikipedia articles formatted for use with PDAs (specifically, the Mobipocket and TomeRaider formats). The production of the DVD motivated the Personendaten project (see above). The vetting process was similar to the one for the CD described above and took place on a separate MediaWiki server. The process took about a week and involved 33 Wikipedians, communicating on IRC. To prevent duplication of work, editors would protect every article that they had reviewed; links to protected articles were shown in green. Lists of potential spammed or vandalized articles had been produced ahead of time with SQL queries. Unacceptable articles were simply deleted on the spot. While the XML articles for the earlier CD version had been produced from HTML, this time a script was used to convert Wiki markup directly to the Digibib format. The final DVD contained about 205,000 articles, with every article linking to a list of contributors. Directmedia sold 30,000 DVDs, at ‚Ç¨9.90 each. This price included 16% taxes and a one-euro donation to Wikimedia Deutschland; production costs were about ‚Ç¨2. The DVD image can also be downloaded for free. Following the successful launch of the DVD, Directmedia donated high-resolution pictures of 10,000 public domain paintings to Wikimedia Commons (see related Signpost story). = DVD/book December 2005 = The 2005 DVD/book version of German Wikipedia. The next edition of Wikipedia content was issued in December 2005 by the publisher Zenodot Verlagsgesellschaft mbH, a sister company of Directmedia. A 139-page book explaining Wikipedia, its history and policies was accompanied by a 7.5 GB DVD containing 300,000 articles and 100,000 images. The book with DVD is sold for ‚Ç¨9.90; both are also available for free download.Heise newsticker: Neue Wikipedia-DVD im Handel und zum Download, 9 December 2005 The vetting process for this version was different and did not involve human intervention. A \\"white list\\" of trusted Wikipedians was assembled, the last 10 days of every article's history were examined, and the last version edited by a white-listed Wikipedian was chosen for the DVD. If no such version existed, the last version older than 10 days was used. Articles nominated for cleanup or deletion were not used. = DVD December 2006/2007 and 2007/2008 = The December 2006/2007 and 2007/2008 edition can be downloaded from dvd.wikimedia.org. = Books =  Wikipress series  The December 2005 book about Wikipedia was the first in a series titled Wikipress. These books, published by Zenodot, consisted of a collection of Wikipedia articles about a common topic, selected and edited by so-called \\"Wikipeditors\\" who may receive compensation from Directmedia. The books were assembled on a separate server from those used for the regular German Wikipedia pages. Every Wikipress book was accompanied by an \\"edit card\\", a post card that readers could send in to edit the book's contents. Wikipress books about the Nobel Peace Prize, bicycles, Antarctica, the solar system, and Hip hop, amongst others, were released, and other books on topics as diverse as Whales, Conspiracy theories, Manga, Astrophysics, and the Red Cross were in the works. Due to lack of interest, the project was ended after a few books.  100 volume Wikipedia  The publisher Zenodot announced in January 2006 that they intend to publish the complete German Wikipedia in print, 100 volumes with 800 pages each, starting with the letter A in October 2006, followed by two volumes each month thereafter, to end with Z in 2010. The project, code named WP 1.0, was to be supported by 25 editors employed by Zenodot as well as a scientific advisory board. Changes made to articles before publication would also be available for incorporation into the online Wikipedia. In March 2006, Zenodot organized a \\"community day\\" to meet with Wikipedians and discuss the project. Groups of Wikipedians had already begun to polish articles with titles Aa-Af in selected topics. In late March it was announced that the project was put on hold and no books would be published in 2006; the reason given was that community support was lacking.Heise newsticker: Wikipedia wird noch nicht gedruckt, 24 March 2006  Bertelsmann  On 22 April 2008, the publisher Bertelsmann announced that it planned to publish a one-volume encyclopedia in September using content from the German-language Wikipedia. The volume was planned to include abbreviated entries for the 50,000 most commonly used search terms of the prior two years. The book is priced at 19.95 euros, with one euro from every sale going to the German chapter of the Wikimedia Foundation.\\"Wikipedia to go book-based in Germany\\", Agence France-Presse, 23 April 2008 It was released on 15 September 2008 in hardcover, containing 992 pages and many illustrations.  Legal issues and controversies  = Deletions = Comparison of the number of new articles and deletions in the German Wikipedia, Jan 2008 - Aug/Oct 2010 The German Wikipedia has been criticized for the deletion of articles because they seem \\"irrelevant\\" to those who deleted them, even though they seem expedient, meaningful, well written and extensive enough to other people. These discussions received press coverage in computer magazines as well as in mainstream media.\\"Further deletions of Linux distributions in Wikipedia proposed\\" article in a Linux computer magazine 10 April 2007\\"Wikipedia: The fight for relevance\\" in c't computer magazine 30 October 2009\\"Wikipedia: Dispute about arbitrary deletions\\" article in a Windows computer magazine 19 October 2009\\"Wikipedia: World champion in deleting?\\" on gulli.com news 27 December 2009Article about the planned deletion of a Wikipedia article about a TV celebrity on the news portal of T-Home (biggest ISP in Germany) 16 July 2010 = Unauthorized uses = While everyone is free to use Wikipedia content, there are certain conditions, such as attribution, a copy of the license text and no non-free derivative works (see Creative Commons licenses and GNU Free Documentation License for details). In March 2005, the German news magazine Der Spiegel published an article on the Rwandan genocide in its online edition; it was a copy of Wikipedia's article. The article was taken down soon after and replaced with an apology.German Spiegel Copied Wikipedia 9 March 2005 In April 2005, the encyclopedia Brockhaus published an article about the new pope Josef Ratzinger in its online edition. Because of its close similarity to Wikipedia's article, suspicion arose right away that the Brockhaus article might have been plagiarism. The article was removed soon after but Brockhaus did not apologize or admit guilt (see The Signpost .) = Large-scale copyright infringement (2003‚Äì2005) = In mid-November 2005, it was discovered that an anonymous user had entered hundreds of articles from older encyclopedias that had been published in the 1970s and 1980s in East Germany. The articles were mainly on topics in philosophy and related areas. The user had started in December 2003. A press release was issued and numerous editors started to remove the copyright protected materials. This was made difficult by the fact that the old encyclopedias were not online and not easily available from many West German libraries, and that the user had used numerous different IP addresses. The Directmedia DVD had to be updated.Report on copyright infringement = Bertrand Meyer article hoax = On 28 December 2005, the article about computer scientist Bertrand Meyer (creator of the Eiffel programming language) was edited by an anonymous user, falsely reporting that Meyer had died four days earlier. The hoax was reported five days later by the Heise News Ticker and the article was immediately corrected. Major news media in Germany and Switzerland picked up on the story. Meyer himself went on to publish a positive evaluation of Wikipedia, concluding, \\"The system succumbed to one of its potential flaws, and quickly healed itself. This doesn't affect the big picture. Just like those about me, rumors about Wikipedia's downfall have been grossly exaggerated.\\"Defense and illustration of Wikipedia , by Bertrand Meyer, January 2006 = Naming Tron = In 2006, Wikimedia Deutschland, the German chapter of the US Wikimedia Foundation, was drawn into a legal dispute between the parents of the deceased German computer hacker Boris \\"Tron\\" Floricic and the Foundation. The parents did not wish Floricic's real name to be publicly mentioned, and in December 2005 they obtained a preliminary injunction in a Berlin court against the American Wikimedia Foundation, requiring removal of Floricic's name from Wikipedia. The name was not removed. On 19 January 2006 they obtained a second injunction, this time against Wikimedia Deutschland, prohibiting the address \`www.wikipedia.de\` (which is under control of Wikimedia Deutschland) to redirect to the German Wikipedia at \`de.wikipedia.org\` (which is controlled by the Wikimedia Foundation and hosts the actual encyclopedia) as long as Wikipedia mentioned Floricic's name. Wikimedia Deutschland complied and replaced the redirect with a note explaining the situation, but without mentioning the Tron case specifically. The German Wikipedia remained accessible through \`de.wikipedia.org\` during this time. One day later, Wikimedia Deutschland achieved a suspension of the injunction, and linked from the note at \`www.wikipedia.de\` to the German Wikipedia. On 9 February, the court invalidated the injunction, ruling that neither the rights of the deceased nor the rights of the parents were affected by publishing the name; this ruling was upheld on appeal, decided 12 May. = Lutz Heilmann controversy = In November 2008, Lutz Heilmann, a member of the German parliament, obtained a preliminary injunction against Wikimedia Deutschland e. V., forbidding the forwarding of \`www.wikipedia.de\` to \`de.wikipedia.org\`. According to Focus Online, Heilmann objected to claims that he had not completed his university degree, and that he had participated in a business venture involving pornography. The report also suggests that the Wikipedia article had been repeatedly altered in line with his claims by an anonymous user operating within the Bundestag building, but Heilmann denied having been involved in an edit war. Wikimedia Germany displayed a page explaining the situation. Heilmann announced on 16 November that he would drop the legal proceedings against Wikimedia Deutschland, regretting that many uninvolved users of the encyclopedia had been affected. =Superprotect and Media Viewer controversy= In 2014, the Wikimedia Foundation (WMF) \\"superprotected\\" a JavaScript file on German Wikipedia so that no German editors, not even administrators, were allowed to edit it. Many German editors left over this dispute.Wikipedia: Superprotect-Streit spitzt sich zuWikimedia-Stiftung zwingt deutschen Nutzern Mediaviewer auf An open letter to the WMF was signed by almost 1,000 Wikimedians. In April 2015 Erik M√∂ller left the WMF; the \\"superprotect\\" feature was disabled in November. =Reiss Engelhorn Museum= In 2015, the Reiss Engelhorn Museum sued the WMF and its German chapter Wikimedia Deutschland for alleged copyright violations of 17 public domain pictures.  Parodies and forks  Parodies of the German Wikipedia include Kamelopedia, created in April 2004, Stupidedia, created in December 2004, and the German version of Uncyclopedia, created in August 2005.Chip.de: Brockhaus f√ºr Kamele - Wikipedia-Parodien , 11 March 2008 Ulrich Fuchs, a longtime contributor to the German Wikipedia, produced a fork known as Wikiweise in April 2005. It is ad-supported, uses its own software (but a similar wiki markup), admits only registered editors, and prominently displays the real names of every article's major contributors. It has since gone offline. References  Further reading  * Lih, Andrew. The Wikipedia Revolution: How a Bunch of Nobodies Created the World's Greatest Encyclopedia. Hyperion, New York City. 2009.

Early life and education  Reitz was born in Morbach, Hunsr√ºck. His father Robert was a watchmaker and his business in Morbach was later taken over by Reitz's brother Guido. Reitz's interest in acting and producing plays began in his school years in Simmern, where he was encouraged by his German teacher Karl Windh√§user. After taking his Abitur, he studied German studies, journalism, art history and theatre studies in Munich from 1952. His first experiences in film-making however were not theoretical; he worked as a camera, editing, and production assistant from 1953. His interests in the advancement of new developments in film went as far as he cooperated with Wolfgang Georgsdorf and his Osmodrama in 2016 which led to a complete scent synchronisation of his movie ‚Äúhome from home‚Äù which premiered as an allegedly well functioned cinema on the 17 July 2016.  Institut f√ºr Filmgestaltung  In 1963 along with Alexander Kluge he founded the Institut f√ºr Filmgestaltung (Institute for Film Design) which was affiliated to the Ulm School of Design, where he taught film directing and camera theory until the School of Design closed in 1968. As part of the group around Kluge, Reitz was a participant in the Oberhausen Manifesto which was announced at the Oberhausen Short Film Festival of 1962. With this manifesto young German filmmakers demanded nothing less than a new form of cinema: \\"Der alte Film ist tot. Wir glauben an den neuen.\\" (\\"The old film is dead. We believe in the new film\\"). The manifesto is associated with the motto \\"Papas Kino ist tot\\" (\\"Papa's cinema is dead\\"). Subsequently, the concept of the auteur gained in popularity in Germany, and Reitz played a significant role in shaping this concept in the following years.  Awards  Reitz received one of his first awards for his film Mahlzeiten which was awarded the prize for best debut work at the Venice Film Festival in 1967. In 1971 he founded Edgar Reitz Filmproduktion (ERF) in Munich. He now began to collaborate on films with his former academic colleague Alexander Kluge amongst them the 1974 fictitious documentary In Gefahr und gr√∂√üter Not bringt der Mittelweg den Tod. The lavish production costs of the 1979 film The Tailor of Ulm, which portrays the downfall of the aviation pioneer Albrecht Berblinger, caused Reitz's own financial circumstances to take a tumble. The film was entered into the 11th Moscow International Film Festival. It was during this crisis that the idea for a film project about his homeland, the Hunsr√ºck, first came to Reitz. What began as an attempt at self-discovery, ultimately broadened out into the Heimat trilogy (from 1984), which met with critical acclaim, an enthusiastic international audience, and numerous prizes. With this epic and monumental production, Reitz achieved a quite new perspective, an approach, both poetical and realistic, to the past of Germany as it might have played out in the provinces. In 2004 Reitz was awarded the Carl Zuckmayer Medal by the state of Rhineland-Palatinate for his life's work. In the same year, he received the Master of Cinema Award of the International Filmfestival Mannheim-Heidelberg. Reitz is married to the singer and actress Salome Kammer (who appeared in Heimats 2 and 3) and lives in Munich. He is an atheist.Matteo Galli, Edgar Reitz, Il Castoro, 2006, p. 25.

Originally clericus justiciarie or Clerk to the Court of Justiciary, the counterpart in the criminal courts of the Lord Clerk Register, the status of the office increased over time and the Justice-Clerk came to claim a seat on the Bench by practice and custom. This was recognised by the Privy Council of Scotland in 1663 and the Lord Justice Clerk became the effective head of the reformed High Court of Justiciary in 1672 when the court was reconstituted. The Lord Justice Clerk now rarely presides at criminal trials in the High Court, with most of his or her time being spent dealing with civil and criminal appeals. The Lord Justice Clerk has the title in both the Court of Session and the High Court of Justiciary and, as President of the Second Division of the Inner House, is in charge of the Second Division of Judges of the Inner House of the Court of Session.

Usage The carnet allows travellers to temporarily import their vehicles, or other items of value such as broadcasting equipment, without having to leave a cash deposit at the border. It is, in essence, an international guarantee for payment of customs duties and taxes to a government should the vehicle or item not be re-exported from that country.

She is best known for directing M√§dchen in Uniform (1931). Along with directing for both cinema and the stage, Sagan also acted in multiple films throughout her lifetime. She died in Pretoria, South Africa in 1974, at the age of 85. Personal life Born in either Budapest or Vienna in 1889, Sagan trained with Max Reinhardt, who is best known for his elaborate and imaginative sets and theatrics. In 1899, as a child, she moved to South Africa with her family just before World War One. She was educated in a German-language school in Johannesburg. In her later years, Sagan married publisher and writer Dr. Victor Fleischer; the union was childless. Career Sagan directed three films. She is best remembered for the first of two films she directed, M√§dchen in Uniform (1931). It has an all-female cast and was ground-breaking not only for its portrayal of lesbian and pedagogical eros, but also for the production's co-operative and profit-sharing financial arrangements. Whether Sagan herself was a lesbian is unknown;lespress.de \\"vermutlich lesbische Regisseurin\\" (Eng.: \\"possibly lesbian director\\") the book Women Film Directors lists her as \\"lesbian film director\\" as she directed Christa Winsloe's play, said to contain lesbian themes. In her teenage years, she worked as a stage actress in Germany and Austria.

She later worked as a theatre producer in Manchester. She was also the first female producer at London's Drury Lane, where she successfully presided over a series of Ivor Novello's musicals in the West End: Glamorous Night (1935), Careless Rapture (1936), Crest of the Wave (1937), The Dancing Years (1939) and Arc de Triomphe (1943). The popularity of these shows is credited with saving Drury Lane from potential closure in the 1930s. Towards the end of her career, Sagan moved to South Africa and became an influential director in South African theatre, and co-founded the National Theatre in Johannesburg. In February 1948 she directed the NTO's first English production Dear Brutus by J.M. Barrie, followed by An Inspector Calls. Directed In Theatre Street for the East Rand Theatre Club in 1950. (Leontine Sagan - ESAT. N.p., n.d. Web. 12 Dec. 2016.) Filmography *M√§dchen in Uniform (1931) Sagan‚Äôs most significant film featured an all-female cast. It was the first film in Germany to be produced cooperatively (both the crew and cast obtained shares rather than a salary).Acker, A. (1991). Reel women: Pioneers of the cinema, 1896 to the present (pp. 320-22). New York: Continuum. M√§dchen in Uniform is based on the play by Christa Winsloe. It survived but was much censored until the 1970s. Eleanor Roosevelt is credited with helping to revoke its censorship in the US. It was released in its surviving form on video-tape, with English subtitles, in the US in 1994 and in the UK in 2000. The film centers on an all-girls boarding school. It examines various emotional and physical pressures caused by the authoritarian rule and militarism of the Prussian headmistress. It is thought to be an anti-fascist film that critiques the Prussian education system. Many critics also argue that the film is suggesting of feminist notions, since the women characters openly express their emotions and sexual orientations. The film is among the first to suggest lesbian themes. Throughout M√§dchen in Uniform, girls are depicted holding hands, shown dressing and undressing, and in one scene two women are depicted kissing on the lips.The film‚Äôs main character Manuela, a 14-year-old girl, develops a crush on her teacher Fr√§ulein von Bernburg, which affects her performance in her class and in the school's theatre production. Manuela eventually has a public and drunken breakdown in which she confesses her love for Fr√§ulein von Bernburg, after which she is sanctioned by the headmistress, but supported by her fellow students. The headmistress forbids Fr√§ulein von Bernburg to see or speak to Manuela again. Manuela nearly kills herself but is found and saved. The film was banned by the Nazis as 'decadent', but it has left a significant mark on history for its female imagery and anti-militaristic themes. This film was influential at women‚Äôs film festivals in the 1970s.M√§dchen in Uniform review; retrieved 2 May 2015; accessed 16 May 2017.

Published in the United Kingdom by Hodder & Stoughton and in America by Putnam, the book is set in Hong Kong, China, Jamaica, England, and some parts of Western Australia. Benson's working title for the novel was No Tears for Hong Kong; this was eventually used as the title for the last chapter in the novel. Continuity According to Raymond Benson, as far as character continuity was concerned, he had been given free lease by Ian Fleming Publications (then Glidrose Publications) to follow or ignore other continuation authors as he saw fit. Benson took a middle-of-the-road approach to this. While Benson treats Ian Fleming's novels as strictly canon, Gardner's novels are not, though there are some aspects that he adopts. For instance, in Gardner's Win, Lose or Die Bond is promoted to Captain, but Benson's novels have Bond holding the rank of Commander again with no explanation. Some of Gardner's original recurring characters are also not present, including Ann Reilly (aka Q'ute), who, by the end of Gardner's era, had taken over Q Branch from Major Boothroyd; Benson features Major Boothroyd, again, with no explanation. Some of Gardner's changes do remain--for instance, Benson's Bond continues to smoke cigarettes from H. Simmons of Burlington Arcade, which dates from Gardner's For Special Services (1982). Additionally, the Bond girls Fredericka von Gr√ºsse (Never Send Flowers / SeaFire), Harriet Horner (Scorpius), and Easy St. John (Death is Forever) are all mentioned. Benson's other novels also retain aspects of Gardner's series, though there is just as much that he ignores. Some elements of the films also carry over into Benson's novels. M, for instance, is not Sir Miles Messervy, but the female M that was first introduced in the film GoldenEye (1995), although Gardner also introduced this character in his novelisation of that film and retained the character through his final novel COLD (1996). Bond also reverts to using his trusty Walther PPK, claiming he had switched to other guns (notably the ASP in Gardner's later novels), but felt that it was time he used it again. The follow-up to Zero Minus Ten, the novelization to Tomorrow Never Dies, has Bond switching to the Walther P99, which remains Bond's main weapon throughout Benson's novels. Later novels by Benson also attempt to insert some of the characters from the films into his story. In The Facts of Death, for instance, Admiral Hargreaves is present at a party. Plot summary As the transfer of the sovereignty of Hong Kong from the British to the People's Republic of China nears, Bond is given ten days to investigate a series of terrorist attacks that could disrupt the fragile handover and cause the breakout of a large-scale war. Simultaneously a nuclear bomb is test-detonated in the Australian outback. In Hong Kong, Bond suspects a British shipping magnate, Guy Thackeray, who he catches cheating at mahjong at a casino in Macau. Later, after cheating the cheater and winning a large sum of Thackeray's money, Bond attends a press conference where Thackeray announces that he is selling his company, EurAsia Enterprises, to the Chinese; not disclosed to the public is that this is due to a long-forgotten legal document that grants the descendants of Li Wei Tam ownership of the company if the British were to ever lose control of Hong Kong. Because the descendants were believed to have abandoned China, General Wong claims the document on behalf of the Chinese government and forces Thackeray out. Immediately following the announcement, Thackeray is killed by a car bomb planted by an unknown assassin, the latest of a series of assassinations that claimed the lives of the entire EurAsia board of directors, as well as several employees. Through his Hong Kong contact, T.Y. Woo, Bond also investigates Li Xu Nan, the Triad head of the Dragon Wing society and the rightful descendant of Li Wei Tam. Li's identity as the Triad head is supposed to be a secret, though after Bond involves a hostess, Sunni Pei, 007 is forced to protect her from the Triads for breaking an oath of secrecy. When she is finally captured, Bond makes a deal, off the record, to go to Guangzhou and retrieve the long-forgotten document from General Wong that will give Li Xu Nan ownership of EurAsia Enterprises upon the handover at midnight on July 1, 1997. Through Li's contacts, Bond successfully travels and meets General Wong in Guangzhou under the guise of a solicitor from England. Bond's cover is later blown and T.Y. Woo, who followed Bond, is executed. Bond avenges his friend's death by killing General Wong, stealing the document, which he hand-delivers to Li Xu Nan, and rescuing Sunni Pei. With Li Xu Nan in Bond's debt, Bond uses Li's contacts to go to Australia to investigate EurAsia Enterprises and find a link between it and the nuclear blast. As it turns out Thackeray is very much alive and has been mining unreported uranium in Australia to make his own nuclear bomb, which he plans to detonate in Hong Kong at the moment the handover takes place in retaliation for the loss of his family's legacy. Returning to Hong Kong, Bond, Li Xu Nan, and a Royal Navy captain track down Thackeray's nuclear bomb and defuse it. The battle claims the lives of Li Xu Nan as well as Thackeray, who is drowned by Bond in the harbour.

The site lies about south of the centre of Salisbury and north of Odstock village. It was partially excavated between 1938 and 1939 by Gerhard Bersu, a German archaeologist who had been driven to Britain following discrimination by the Nazis. In excavations like Little Woodbury he introduced the revolutionary approaches in the excavation of settlements (e.g. the identification of timber post remains) developed in continental Europe during previous decades. A settlement had been identified at the site through aerial archaeology by O.G.S. Crawford almost twenty years previously. He had seen a circular enclosure as a cropmark, and it was identified for further excavation as a possible source of information on everyday prehistoric Britain. Bersu was commissioned by the Prehistoric Society to excavate the site in order to improve knowledge of early British settlement sites, which were until then poorly understood. Bersu dug a network of parallel trenches, one after the other, across the site. By this method he was able to identify a large roundhouse and several other domestic features. The postholes of the roundhouse enabled Bersu to argue that these structures were the common domestic building type of the Iron Age; prior to his work it was thought that people lived in holes in the ground. Through Bersu's identification of animal bone and cereal grains, he convinced other archaeologists to re-evaluate the large holes they had found as storage pits. When war broke out in 1939, work stopped and Bersu was interned on the Isle of Man. He never returned to the site and post-excavation work was never fully completed. The results from Little Woodbury however served to influence generations of archaeologists to take an interest in the day-to-day life of ancient peoples and the roundhouse has become a regular feature in interpreting prehistoric sites.

The range extends from southeast Arizona and southwest New Mexico, United States, south in Mexico along the Sierra Madre Occidental and the Sierra Madre Oriental to southern Zacatecas and San Luis Potos√≠. It occurs at moderate to high altitudes, from , in cool, dry climate conditions. Description Pinus johannis is a small to medium-size tree, often just a shrub, reaching tall and with a trunk diameter of up to . The bark is grey-brown, thin and scaly at the base of the trunk. The leaves ('needles') are in mixed fascicles of three and four, slender, long, and deep green to blue-green, with stomata confined to a bright white band on the inner surfaces. The cones are globose, long and broad when closed, green at first, ripening yellow-brown when 16‚Äì18 months old, with only a small number of thin, fragile scales, typically 6-12 fertile scales. The cones open to broad when mature, holding the seeds on the scales after opening. The seeds are long, with a thick shell, a white endosperm, and a vestigial wing; they are dispersed by the Mexican jay, which plucks the seeds out of the open cones. The jay, which uses the seeds as a major food resource, stores many of the seeds for later use; some of these stored seeds are not used and are able to grow into new trees. History Pinus johannis is a recently described pinyon pine, discovered by Elbert L. Little in 1968 when comparing pinyons growing in Arizona with those of typical Mexican pinyon (Pinus cembroides) in Mexico; he described it as a variety of Mexican pinyon, Pinus cembroides var. bicolor, noting the very different stomatal placing on the leaves; it also differs in needle number, with 3‚Äì4 per fascicle, rather than 2‚Äì3; in the cones having thinner scales; and in having a denser, more rounded crown. Further research by the French botanist Marie-Fran√ßoise Robert-Passini, the American botanists Dana K. Bailey and Frank G. Hawksworth and others, has shown that it is better treated as a distinct species. Although often occurring together with Mexican pinyon, it is reproductively isolated from that by its pollination being a month to two months later in summer, rather than in spring, thereby preventing hybridisation. As Robert-Passini and Bailey & Hawksworth were working in different areas at about the same time, it was raised to species rank twice, first as Pinus johannis by Robert-Passini (naming it after her husband Jean) examining specimens in the Sierra Madre Oriental in Mexico, and then later as Pinus discolor by Bailey & Hawksworth examining specimens in the northern Sierra Madre Occidental in Arizona. There are slight differences between the plants in the two ranges; those in the eastern being more shrubby and with larger cones than those in the western range, and also differences in the resin composition; they are though generally very similar and recognition of both as separate species from each other does not appear warranted. Some botanists also still include P. johannis in Mexican pinyon as a variety or even not distinguished at all, accounting for reports of \\"Mexican pinyon\\" in Arizona and New Mexico. This is despite the two frequently occurring together at the same sites with no hybridisation. Pinus johannis is most closely allied to Orizaba pinyon (Pinus orizabensis) and Potosi pinyon (Pinus culminicola), with which it shares the leaf structure with the stomata confined to the inner faces; it differs from the former in the smaller cones and seeds, and from the latter in fewer needles per fascicle (3-4 vs 5). Uses The edible pine nut seeds are collected in Mexico to a small extent. The white-glaucous inner surfaces of the needles make it a very attractive small tree, suitable for parks and large gardens.

After the war was declared over by the United States in 1902, Sakay continued resistance by leading guerrilla raids. The following year he became President of the Tagalog Republic. Early life Macario Sakay de Le√≥n was born on March 1, 1878 along Tabora Street, Tondo, in the City of Manila. He first worked as an apprentice in a kalesa (carriage) manufacturing shop. He was also a tailor and a stage actor, performing in a number of plays including Principe Baldovino, Doce Pares de Francia, and Amante de la Corona. An original member of the Katipunan movement, which he joined in 1894, he fought alongside Andr√©s Bonifacio against the Spanish throughout the Philippine Revolution. In 1899, he continued the struggle for Philippine independence against the United States. Early in the Philippine-American War, he was jailed for seditious activities, and later released as part of an amnesty. After the war Sakay was one of the founders of the Partido Nacionalista (unrelated to the present Nacionalista Party founded in 1907), which sought to achieve Philippine independence through legal means. The party appealed to the Philippine Commission, but the Commission passed the Sedition Law, which prohibited any form of propaganda advocating independence.United States Philippine Commission. Law against treason, sedition, etc. (Act No. 292) . Washington, D.C.: Government Printing Office, 1902. Sakay took up arms again. Sakay and the Aguinaldo regime Contrary to popular belief, the Philippine resistance to American rule did not end with the capture of Gen. Emilio Aguinaldo. Several forces remained at large, including one led by Sakay. Sakay's rank and association within Aguinaldo's Revolutionary Government is unknown. When Aguinaldo surrendered to the US, Sakay seized the leadership of the revolution and declared himself Supreme President of the Tagalog Republic. He said this included all the islands of the Philippines from Luzon to Mindanao. Taking over the Morong‚ÄìNueva Ecija command and assigning his deputies to take charge of the other Tagalog regions, Sakay wrote a constitution in which traitors, or supporters of the enemy, were to be punished with exile, imprisonment, or death. In May 1902, Sakay and his men declared open resistance to the US and conducted guerrilla raids that lasted for several years . Tagalog Republic Around 1902, Sakay established the Tagalog Republic somewhere in the mountains of Rizal. His first military circulars and presidential orders as \\"President and Commander-in-Chief\\" were issued in 1903. Sakay's military circular No. 1 was dated May 5, 1903, and his Presidential Order No. 1 was dated March 18, 1903. =Military organization= In Sakay's military circular No. 7, dated June 19, 1903, the government of the Tagalog Republic (called the \\"Republic of the Philippines\\") affirmed the formation of an organized army. The army units were composed of Kabohans (eight soldiers, equivalent to a squad), Camilleros (nine soldiers), Companias (117 soldiers, equivalent to a company, and Batalions (801 soldiers, equivalent to battalion). However, in Sakay's Second Manifesto, dated April 5, 1904, it said the exact number of soldiers in the army could not be ascertained. There are insufficient documents to provide a basis for historians to speculate on the size of the Republic's army, but these demonstrate that Sakay's army existed and that it was led by officers appointed and commissioned by Sakay himself. In Sakay's presidential order No. 2, dated May 8, 1903, the government, in search of sources of weapons to carry out its struggle against the Americans, said that it was willing to confer military rank on citizens who could turn over firearms to the Presidential Office or any of the headquarters under its command. Ranks would be conferred by the following schedule: 10 to 15 firearms, rank of lieutenant; 16 to 25 firearms, captain; 26 to 36 firearms, major; 40 to 50 firearms, colonel. In Sakay's military order No. 5, dated May 25, 1903, the government assigned the following color codes for the divisions of its army: artillery (red), infantry (light blue), cavalry (dark blue), engineering (dark brown), chief-of-staff (dark green), sanitary (yellow), and marines (gray). =Planned kidnapping= According to General Leon Villafuerte, his, Carreon's and Sakay's forces planned to kidnap Alice Roosevelt Longworth, the daughter of President Theodore Roosevelt, who was planning to visit the Philippines. The plan was to trade her to the Americans in exchange for the immediate recognition of Philippine independence. The kidnapping was not attempted since Longworth postponed her trip by train to Baguio. Surrender and betrayal In 1905, Filipino labour leader Dominador G√≥mez was authorised by Governor-General Henry Clay Ide to negotiate for the surrender of Sakay and his men. G√≥mez met with Sakay at his camp and argued that the establishment of a national assembly was being held up by Sakay's intransigence, and that its establishment would be the first step toward Filipino independence. Sakay agreed to end his resistance on the condition that a general amnesty be granted to his men, that they be permitted to carry firearms, and that he and his officers be permitted to leave the country. G√≥mez assured Sakay that these conditions would be acceptable to the Americans, and Sakay's emissary, General Le√≥n Villafuerte, obtained agreement to them from the American Governor- General. Sakay believed that the struggle had shifted to constitutional means, and that the establishment of the assembly was a means to win independence. As a result, he surrendered on 20 July 1906, descending from the mountains on the promise of an amnesty for him and his officials, and the formation of a Philippine Assembly composed of Filipinos that would serve as the \\"gate of freedom\\". With Villafuerte, Sakay travelled to Manila, where they were welcomed and invited to receptions and banquets. One invitation came from the Constabulary Chief, American Colonel Harry H. Bandholtz; it was a trap. Sakay and his principal lieutenants were disarmed and arrested while the party was in progress. At his trial, Sakay was accused of bandolerismo \\"under the Brigandage Act of Nov. 12, 1902, which interpreted all acts of armed resistance to American rule as banditry.\\" The American colonial Supreme Court of the Philippines upheld the decision. Sakay was convicted and sentenced to death, and hanged on 13 September 1907. Before his death, he made the following statement: He was buried at Manila North Cemetery later that day.

His election was supported by the Emperor Frederick Barbarossa. He took the name Victor IV, not accounting for Antipope Victor IV of 1138, whose holding of the papal office was deemed illegitimate. Early life and career Octaviano Monticelli belonged to one of the most powerful counts of Tusculum. He was appointed as rector of Benevento in May 1137, and cardinal priest of San Nicola in Carcere in 1138. In 1151 Octaviano became cardinal priest of Santa Cecilia. He was described by John of Salisbury as eloquent and refined, but petty and parsimonious. When he was sent with Cardinal Jordan of Santa Susanna as a papal legate to summon Conrad III of Germany to Italy to be crowned Holy Roman Emperor, he quarreled with his co-legate and, in John of Salisbury's words, \\"made the Church a laughingstock\\".Norwich, 149‚Äì150 and note. In Germany, he met Frederick, duke of Swabia, who would soon become the new Emperor Frederick Barbarossa; the cardinal was present at the imperial election.The Cardinals of the Holy Roman Church-Momticelli; S. Miranda Reign as pope =Election= Following the death of Pope Adrian IV, the College of Cardinals gathered to elect a new pope. During the Papal election of 4‚Äì7 September 1159 they elected the chancellor Rolando, who assumed the title of Alexander III. However, five cardinals, the clergy of St. Peter's, and the Roman populace refused to recognize him and elected their own candidate Octaviano on 7 September 1159. He was very popular on account of his liberality, accessibility, and splendour of living. He was considered a great friend of the Germans, and rested his hopes on the Emperor Frederick Barbarossa. Yet it is not to be assumed that the emperor, busy with the Siege of Crema, had desired his election; Rolando was certainly not agreeable to him, yet neither was it to his interest to have an antipope. =Consecration= Victor IV was consecrated on 4 October in the abbey of Farfa by Cardinal-Bishop Imar of Tusculum, dean of the Sacred College of Cardinals, assisted by Ubaldo, bishop of Ferentino and Riccardo, bishop of Melfi.Jaff√©, p. 828 With the armed assistance of Otto von Wittelsbach and his own armed groups in relatively short time he took control over the City of Rome and the Patrimony of St. Peter, while Alexander III took refuge in the territory of the Kingdom of Sicily, and later in France.Robinson, p. 484 =Synod at Pavia= Both popes sent their legates to the Catholic kingdoms in order to secure their recognition. As a matter of fact the emperor was at first neutral and called upon the bishops not to take sides; the decision, the emperor said, should be reserved for the action of the Church. Being the chief protector of the Church, Victor convoked a synod at Pavia in February 1160. The emperor, after the sacking of Crema the previous month, demanded that Alexander appear before the emperor at Pavia and to accept the imperial decree. Alexander III declined, arguing that the pope should be subjected only to the judgment of God. Emperor Frederick I then declared himself in favour of Victor IV, and the synod decided, as was to be expected, for Victor, and pronounced an anathema upon Alexander. On February 11, 1160, the council ended with a procession to Pavia Cathedral. Here Victor was received by the emperor, who, as a sign of humility, helped him to get off the horse and took him by the hand and led him to the altar and kissed his feet. Most of the episcopate of the Empire followed the decision of the synod. However, this attempt to secure Victor's recognition was never completely successful in Germany, since Bishop Eberhard of Salzburg was his principal opponent. In response, Alexander on his side excommunicated both Frederick I and Victor IV. =Recognition= King Valdemar I of Denmark also gave his support to Victor IV, but the primate of Denmark archbishop Eskil of Lund became a partisan of Alexander III.Angelo Forte, Richard Oram, Frederik Pedersen, Viking empires, Cambridge University Press, 2005 , p. 382 It seems that Poland also supported Victor IV.Polish bishops took part in the schismatic synods in 1160 and 1165 (Dzieje Ko≈õcio≈Ça w Polsce, ed. A. Wiencek, Krak√≥w 2008, p. 75) Alexander was nevertheless able to gain the support of the rest of western Europe, because since the days of Hildebrand the power of the pope over the church in the various countries had increased so greatly that the kings of France and of England could not view with indifference a revival of such imperial control of the papacy as had been exercised by the Emperor Henry III. Therefore, France, England, Castile, Sweden, Norway, Scotland, Hungary, Sicily, and the Crusader states in Outremer recognized Alexander III as true pope, even if in some of these countries there were a significant Victorine minorities in episcopates or among feudal rulers.Robinson, pp. 475‚Äì476 The papal schism in Europe was now a fact. In 1162, King Louis VII of France wavered once more. Frederick then attempted to convoke a joint council at Saint-Jean-de-Losne with Louis VII to decide the issue of who should be pope. Louis neared the meeting site, but when he became aware that Frederick had stacked the votes for Alexander, Louis decided not to attend the council. As a result, the issue was not resolved at that time. This disastrous meeting had as its result that the king held firmly to the obedience of Alexander. During the years 1162‚Äì1165 Alexander lived in France, and from 1163 the pope exerted himself to gain more of Germany for his cause. Death All uncertainty came to an end on 20 April 1164. That day, while traveling with Rainald of Dassel, Victor IV died at Lucca. When Pope Alexander III learned of the death of his rival, he wept, and reprimanded his cardinals when they showed inappropriate delight. The clergy of the Lucca Cathedral and San Frediano would not allow Victor IV buried there because of his excommunication. Therefore, he was buried in a local monastery. When miracles were reported at his tomb, it was destroyed by order of Pope Gregory VIII in December 1187.Reardon, 2004, p. 95.Christiane Laudage: Kampf um den Stuhl Petri.

It is a field rife with conflict and controversy. While this area is now seldom offered as a field of study in itself, in which one might become a specialist, there are related fields emerging, as may be judged by the titles of academic journals, some of which have changed to reflect the passage of time since 1989 and the effect of the end of Soviet rule. These include: Communist and Post-Communist Studies, Europe-Asia Studies, Post-Soviet Affairs, Communist Studies and Transition Politics, Communisme, and Demokratizatsiya: The Journal of Post-Soviet Democratization. The historiography of strictly Communist studies is also changing, with some different models of its aims as well as the major shift caused by access to archives. According to John Earl Haynes and Harvey Klehr, writing in their book, In Denial: Historians, Communism & Espionage, the historiography of Soviet and Communist studies is characterized by a split between \\"traditionalists\\" and \\"revisionists\\". Traditionalists characterize themselves as objective reporters of an alleged \\"totalitarian\\" nature of Communism and Communist states; they are criticized by their opponents as being anti-communist, even fascist, in their eagerness on continuing to focus on the issues of the Cold War. Alternative characterizations for traditionalists include \\"orthodox\\", \\"Draperite\\" (after Theodore Draper), \\"conservative\\", \\"right-wing\\" or \\"anti-Communist\\". Norman Markowitz, a prominent revisionist, referred to them as '\\"triumphalist\\", \\"romantics\\", \\"right-wing romantics\\", and \\"reactionaries\\" who belong to the \\"HUAC school of CPUSA scholarship\\"'. Revisionists, characterized by Haynes and Klehr as historical revisionists, are more numerous and, furthermore, dominate academic institutions and learned journals. A suggested alternative formulation is \\"new historians of American communism\\", but that has not caught on. They would describe themselves as unbiased and scholarly and contrast their work to the work of anti-Communist traditionalists whom they would term biased and unscholarly.

It began operating in 1954 in Indianapolis, Indiana, expanded throughout the United States, and at its peak in 1973 had 1,050 locations, including some in Canada. The chain featured several signature items, such as the Big Shef and Super Shef hamburgers. In 1982, the General Foods Corporation, owners of the Burger Chef trademark and name, divested itself of the restaurant chain, gradually selling to the owners of Hardee's. The final restaurant to carry the Burger Chef name closed in 1996. History In 1954, Frank and Donald Thomas patented the flame broiler in their parent company General Equipment Corporation and started their own restaurant in Indianapolis, Indiana. In 1957, they opened their first Burger Chef. A Burger Chef restaurant pictured in the mid-1960s Burger Chef spread across the United States, following a strategy of opening outlets in smaller towns. By 1972 its number of locations (1,200) was surpassed only by McDonald's (1,600). They offered a double burger, called the Big Shef, and later the quarter-pound hamburger, Super Shef. Subsequently, they added the Works Bar, where customers added their own toppings to hamburgers. In 1968, General Foods Corporation purchased the chain and continued its rapid expansion. At the time of the purchase by General Foods, Burger Chef had 600 locations in 39 states. Alternate Link via ProQuest. By 1969 international expansion was underway with General Foods building ten Burger Chef outlets in Australia. The expansion would end in 1975 with a $1.3 Million loss. It was stated that Australians disliked the limited burger based menu as compared to a Milk Bar. The chain had two mascots: Burger Chef (voiced by Paul Winchell) and Jeff (the chef's juvenile sidekick). In the early 1970s, the chain introduced the Funburger and the Funmeal, with packaging that included stories about Burger Chef and Jeff's adventures and friends (including the magician Burgerini, vampire Count Fangburger, talking ape Burgerilla, and Cackleburger the witch), with riddles, puzzles, and small toys. When McDonald's introduced their Happy Meal in 1979, the chain sued, but ultimately lost. In 1982, General Foods sold Burger Chef to the Canadian company Imasco, which also owned Hardee's, for $44 million. Imasco converted many locations to Hardee's restaurants and let franchises and locations near existing Hardee's locations convert to other brands. Remaining restaurants that did not convert to Hardee's or new names and branding simply closed. The Burger Chef logo used in the 1980s Hardee's brought back the Big Shef hamburger for a limited time in 2001, 2007, and 2014 at some Midwestern locations. =Trademark suit= In January 2007, River West Brands, LLC, of Chicago, Illinois, sued Hardee's Food Systems in the US Patents and Trademarks Office, claiming abandonment of the Burger Chef trademark.

In common with all minerals in the olivine group, fayalite crystallizes in the orthorhombic system (space group Pbnm) with cell parameters a 4.82 √Ö, b 10.48 √Ö and c 6.09 √Ö. Fayalite forms solid solution series with the magnesium olivine endmember forsterite (Mg2SiO4) and also with the manganese rich olivine endmember tephroite (Mn2SiO4). The atomic scale structure of fayalite looking along the A axis. Oxygen is shown in red, silicon in pink, and iron in blue. A projection of the unit cell is shown by the black rectangle. Iron rich olivine is a relatively common constituent of acidic and alkaline igneous rocks such as volcanic obsidians, rhyolites, trachytes and phonolites and plutonic quartz syenites where it is associated with amphiboles. Its main occurrence is in ultramafic volcanic and plutonic rocks and less commonly in felsic plutonic rocks and rarely in granite pegmatite. It also occurs in lithophysae in obsidian. It also occurs in medium-grade thermally metamorphosed iron-rich sediments and in impure carbonate rocks. Fayalite is stable with quartz at low pressures, whereas more magnesian olivine is not, because of the reaction olivine + quartz = orthopyroxene. Iron stabilizes the olivine + quartz pair. The pressure and compositional dependence of the reaction can be used to calculate constraints on pressures at which assemblages of olivine + quartz formed. Fayalite can also react with oxygen to produce magnetite + quartz: the three minerals together make up the \\"FMQ\\" oxygen buffer. The reaction is used to control the fugacity of oxygen in laboratory experiments. It can also be used to calculate the fugacity of oxygen recorded by mineral assemblages in metamorphic and igneous processes. Molar volume vs. pressure at room temperature At high pressure, fayalite undergoes a phase transition to ahrensite, the iron-bearing analogue of ringwoodite, i.e., contrary to forsterite there is no intermediate form analogous to wadsleyite; under the conditions prevailing in the upper mantle of the Earth, the transition would occur at ca. 6‚Äì7 GPa, i.e., at substantially lower pressure than the phase transitions of forsterite.D.

Ahrens, AGU Reference Shelf vol. 2, American Geophysical Union, Washington, D.C., pp. 248‚Äì268 In high-pressure experiments, the transformation may be delayed, so that it may remain stable to pressures of almost 35 GPa (see fig.), at which point it may become amorphous rather than take on a crystalline structure such as ahrensite. The name fayalite is derived from Faial (Fayal) Island in the Azores where it was first described in 1840.

The NWICO movement was part of a broader effort to formally tackle global economic inequality that was viewed as a legacy of imperialism upon the global south. The term was widely used by the MacBride Commission, a UNESCO panel chaired by Nobel Peace Prize laureate Se√°n MacBride, which was charged with creation of a set of recommendations to make global media representation more equitable. The MacBride Commission produced a report titled \\"Many Voices, One World\\", which outlined the main philosophical points of the New World Information Communication Order. History The fundamental issues of imbalances in global communication had been discussed for some time. The American media scholar Wilbur Schramm noted in 1964 that the flow of news among nations is thin, that much attention is given to developed countries and little to less-developing ones, that important events are ignored and reality is distorted.Wilbur L. Schramm, Mass Media and National Development: The Role of Information in the Developing Countries, Stanford University Press, 1964, p. 65. From a more radical perspective, Herbert Schiller observed in 1969 that developing countries had little meaningful input into decisions about radio frequency allocations for satellites at a key meeting in Geneva in 1962.Herbert I Schiller, Mass Communications and American Empire, Beacon Press, 1969, p. 140. Schiller pointed out that many satellites had military applications. Intelsat which was set up for international co-operation in satellite communication, was also dominated by the United States. In the 1970s these and other issues were taken up by the Non-Aligned Movement and debated within the United Nations and UNESCO. In 1970, at the 16th Congress of a UNESCO, the NWICO was clearly raised for the first time. NWICO grew out of the New International Economic Order of 1974. From 1976‚Äì1978, the New World Information and Communication Order was generally called the shorter New World Information Order or the New International Information Order. In 1976, for the first time, the slogan of establishing a \\"New World Information and Communication Order\\" was clearly proposed. At the start of this discussion, NWICO got associated with the United Nations Education, Scientific and Cultural Organization (UNESCO) starting from the early 1970s. Mass media concerns began with the meeting of non-aligned nations in Algiers, 1973; again in Tunis 1976, and later in 1976 at the New Delhi Ministerial Conference of Non-Aligned Nations. The 'new order' plan was textually formulated by Tunisia's Information Minister Mustapha Masmoudi. Masmoudi submitted working paper No. 31 to the MacBride Commission. These proposals of 1978 were titled the 'Mass Media Declaration.' The MacBride Commission at the time was a 16-member body created by UNESCO to study communication issues.The Grenada Revolution Online: NWICO - New World Information and Communication Order The UNESCO work on the NWICO was immediately met with criticism from many areas. An interim report released in 1979 by UNESCO was targeted by the American Newspaper Publishers Association and the American Society of Newspaper Editors. While these organizations took issue with some of the early proposals including right of reply and press councils, they also were troubled by the phrase \\"New World Information and Communication Order\\", seeing it as a dog-whistle for the use of government propaganda in the guise of information flow balance. In 1980 the MacBride Report was finally published. The report stated that the right to inform and be informed was critical to modern societies, and that information was a key resource. The report than proposed five main ideas of action to progress these goals # Include communication as a fundamental right. # Reduce imbalances in the news structure. # Strengthen a global strategy for communication while respecting cultural identities and individual rights. # Promote the creation of national communication policies to be coherent and lasting in the processes of development. # Explore how the NWICO could be used to benefit a New International Economic Order (NIEO). Following the release of the report director-general Amadou Mahtar M'Bow was reelected as the head of UNESCO, and those in favor of the NWICO movement found the report giving them strength. UNESCO received a thirty four percent increase in funding, and the United States agreed in principle to creating a new international body for communication in developing countries \\"within the framework of UNESCO\\". The report itself was controversial, as many viewed it as lending strength to the Communist and nonaligned blocs. M'Bow backed a compromise resolution that eliminated the more radical proposals of the report, however hard liners resisted these changes. Likewise, the United States warned that they would not provide funds or technical assistance if UNESCO appeared to desire government control of media. In December 1980 the United Nations formally endorsed the MacBride Report by saying that nations should \\"take into account\\" the report in framing of communications policy. The resolution also invited members to promote \\"the widespread circulation and study\\" of the report. While not a binding resolution, this move was met with immediate criticism from the British government, saying they did not regard the report as definitive. In 1983, the 22nd edition of UNESCO established the medium-term plan for the establishment of NWICO from 1985 to 1989. The struggle to establish a new world information order won broad support within the United Nations. Among those involved in the movement were the Latin American Institute for the Study of Transnationals (ILET). One of its co-founders, Juan Somavia was a member of the MacBride Commission. Another important voice was Mustapha Masmoudi, the Information Minister for Tunisia. In a Canadian radio program in 1983, Tom McPhail describes how the issues were pressed within UNESCO in the mid-1970s when the United States withheld funding to punish the organization for excluding Israel from a regional group of UNESCO. Some OPEC countries and a few socialist countries made up the amount of money and were able to get senior positions within UNESCO. NWICO issues were then advanced at an important meeting in 1976 held in Costa Rica. The only woman member of the Commission was Betty Zimmerman, representing Canada because of the illness of Marshall McLuhan, who died in 1980. The movement was kept alive through the 1980s by meetings of the MacBride Round Table on Communication, even though by then the leadership of UNESCO distanced itself from its ideas. The UNESCO Convention on Cultural Diversity of 2005 puts into effect some of the goals of NWICO, especially with regard to the unbalanced global flow of mass media. However, this convention was not supported by the United States, and it does not appear to be as robust as World Trade Organization agreements that support global trade in mass media and information. Issues A wide range of issues were raised as part of NWICO discussions. Some of these involved long-standing issues of media coverage of the developing world and unbalanced flows of media influence. But other issues involved new technologies with important military and commercial uses. The developing world was likely to be marginalized by satellite and computer technologies. The issues included: * News reporting on the developing world that reflects the priorities of news agencies in London, Paris and New York. Reporting of natural disasters and military coups rather than the fundamental realities. At the time four major news agencies controlled over 80% of global news flow. *The Universal Declaration of Human Rights states \\"everyone has the right ... to seek, receive and impart information and ideas through any media and regardless of frontiers\\". This was used by supporters to claim the NWICO discussions were, at their core, based upon human rights. * An unbalanced flow of mass media from the developed world (especially the United States) to the underdeveloped countries. Everyone watches American movies and television shows. * Advertising agencies in the developed world have indirect but significant effects on mass media in the developing countries. Some observers also judged the messages of these ads to be inappropriate for the Third World. * An unfair division of the radio spectrum. A small number of developed countries controlled almost 90% of the radio spectrum. Much of this was for military use. * There were similar concerns about the allocation of the geostationary orbit (parking spots in space) for satellites. At the time only a small number of developed countries had satellites and it was not possible for developing countries to be allocated a space that they might need ten years later. This might mean eventually getting a space that was more difficult and more expensive to operate. * Satellite broadcasting of television signals into Third World countries without prior permission was widely perceived as a threat to national sovereignty. The UN voted in the early 1970s against such broadcasts. * Use of satellites to collect information on crops and natural resources in the Third World at a time when most developing countries lacked the capacity to analyze this data. * At the time most mainframe computers were located in the United States and there were concerns about the location of databases (such as airline reservations) and the difficulty of developing countries catching up with the US lead in computers. * The protection of journalists from violence was raised as an issue for discussion. For example, journalists were targeted by various military dictatorships in Latin America in the 1970s. As part of NWICO debates there were suggestions for study on how to protect journalists and even to discipline journalists who broke \\"generally recognized ethical standards\\". However, the MacBride Commission specifically came out against the idea of licensing journalists.Many Voices, One World, Paris 1984, p. 236. Responses within the United States The United States government was hostile to NWICO. According to some analysts, the United States saw these issues simply as barriers to the free flow of communication and to the interests of American media corporations. Corporate media lobbyists were incensed at any critical portrayal of the private sector in communication. This centrist view described NWICO as dangerous to freedom of the press by ultimately putting an organization run by governments at the head of controlling global media, potentially allowing for censorship on a large scale.There were also accusations of corruption at the highest level of UNESCO leadership in Paris. While the Carter administration had been responsive to the goals of UNESCO, the Reagan administration took on a different approach. The work of UNESCO was perceived by this administration to limit both individual and press freedoms. Additionally, anti-communist cold war sentiments were gaining increased traction in the United States. The US eventually withdrew its membership in UNESCO at the end of 1984. The matter was complicated by debates within UNESCO about Israel's archaeological work in the city of Jerusalem, and about the Apartheid regime in South Africa. The United States rejoined in 2003. The Independent Media Center was established in Seattle, USA, on November 24 of 1999 as a cluster of independent news media and websites. IMC is a new media collective hosted by grassroots organizations generally supportive of the intent of NWICO (while pointing out 1st amendment concerns along the way). Founded by a grass-roots synthesis of anti- Neoliberalists and activists, IMC was considered to be a pioneering effort to gain freedom of the press, and theoretically part of a more democratic \\"new world information order\\".  Developments  The debate on the NWICO that started in the 1970s reflected criticism about non-equitable access to information and media imperialism. The NWICO saw the United Kingdom and the United States back out of UNESCO until 1997 for the UK and 2003 for the US. In 1990‚Äì2000, a switch occurred globally, carried by the Internet that contributed to bring more equity to the available content. This was supported by the extension of media powers to developing countries such as Mexico, Korea, Kenya and Nigeria; by the adoption of protectionist measures in regards to the free market by western countries like Canada and France; and with the rise of satellite broadcasting as a transnational means for non-western countries. Still, evidence suggests global media has a strong bias towards the global north. Studies estimate around eighty percent of international news travels through Reuters, Agence France-Press, United Press International, and the Associated Press. Only around twenty percent of this news focuses on developing countries. In the decades following the NWICO debates little changed in this regard as a study on stories relating to Africa in the New York Times and The Washington Post showed in 2000. In this study of 89 articles, all lacked sufficient context linking the West to Africa, and seventy-five of them were negative in content. = Windhoek Declaration = This tendency has reached its peak in the 1991 Windhoek Declaration. The Windhoek Declaration for the Development of a Free, Independent and Pluralistic Press is a statement of press freedom principles by African newspaper journalists. African diplomats in Paris (UNESCO), Geneva (ECOSOC) and New York‚Äôs (UN General Assembly) commitment has been crucial to the success of the Windhoek process. UNESCO endorsed the Windhoek Declaration and United Nations General Assembly recognized the 3 May, date of the Declaration, as ‚ÄúWorld Press Freedom Day‚Äù. The Windhoek Declaration has had other significant impacts in the media field. UNESCO adopted the Windhoek framework concerning media development, characterizing it by freedom, pluralism and independence. The Windhoek Declaration is implemented through the Media Development Indicators (MDIs) framework developed by the International Programme for the Development of Communication Intergovernmental Council in 2006. Resonating with the NWICO, the MDIs help assessing the priority areas for media development that are the promotion of freedom of expression and media pluralism, the development of community media and of human resources. = International Programme for the Development of Communication (IPDC) = As a result of the ‚ÄúMany Voices, One World‚Äù 1980 report UNESCO‚Äôs General Conference launched the International Programme for the Development of Communication (IPDC) the same year in Belgrade. The Programme was adopted by 39 Member States and aimed at strengthening the development of mass media in developing countries. Its mandate since 2003 is ‚Äú... to contribute to sustainable development, democracy and good governance by fostering universal access to and distribution of information and knowledge by strengthening the capacities of the developing countries and countries in transition in the field of electronic media and the printed press.‚ÄùAmendments to the Statutes of the International Programme for The Development of Communication (IPDC) Resolution 43/32, adopted on the Report of Commission V at the 18th Plenary Meeting, on 15 October 2003. = World Summit on the Information Society (WSIS) = In December of 2003 in Geneva and November of 2005, two phases of the UN World Summit on the Information Society (WSIS) were held. These gatherings were done to develop a ‚Äòcommon vision of the information society‚Äô and to overcome the digital divide within the United Nations Millennial Development Goals. This process involved both governmental actors as well as non-governmental organizations and sought to solve many of the issues proposed during the NWICO debate. Critics have noted that WSIS was too narrow minded a process and focused exclusively on an information technology approach. = Safety of journalists = Threats on journalists are one of the major issues blocking media development. Since 2008, UNESCO Member States submit information on the status of the judicial inquiries conducted on each of the journalists killings condemned by the Organization. This information is included in a public report submitted every two years to the IPDC Council by the Director-General and is basis to the Programme's follow-up to killings of journalists.The IPDC web page: https://en.unesco.org/programme/ipdc/initiatives The UN Plan of Action on the Safety of Journalists and the Issues of Impunity: http://unesdoc.unesco.org/images/0024/002460/246014E.pdf = Technological developments = Technological developments have direct effects on access to information and on privacy. Access to information is the ability for an individual to seek, receive and impart information effectively. According to Guy Berger, ‚Äúaccess to digital means of communication, even within the limits established by platform owners, is unprecedented‚Äù. Since the NWICO debate, many of the desired developments have come about through access to the internet and mobile phones. Many are now able to seek as well as impart information to the public. The one way information flow from Global North to South has been corrected partially due to this flow of information. The biggest barrier is now lack of access, and as of 2013 only one third of the population has such access (with some of the poorest regions having less than 10% access). There has been a signiÔ¨Åcant increase in access to the Internet in recent years, which reached just over three billion users in 2014, amounting to about 42 per cent of the world's population. Nevertheless, issues remain such as the digital divide, the gender divide and the security argument. A digital divide is an economic and social inequality with regard to access to, use of, or impact of information and communication technologies (ICT).FALLING THROUGH THE NET: A Survey of the \\"Have Nots\\" in Rural and Urban America: https://www.ntia.doc.gov/ntiahome/fallingthru.html National Telecommunications and Information Administration: https://www.ntia.doc.gov/ Social barriers such as illiteracy and lack of digital empowerment have created stark inequalities between men and women in navigating the tools used for access to information: it's the gender divide.Anja Kovac (2017), ‚ÄòChupke, Chupke‚Äô: Going Behind the Mobile Phone Bans in North India, Available at: https://genderingsurveillance.internetdemocracy.in/phone_ban/ Website: https://genderingsurveillance.internetdemocracy.in/ With the evolution of the digital age, application of freedom of speech and its corollaries (freedom of information, access to information) becomes more controversial as new means of communication and restrictions arise including government control or commercial methods putting personal information to danger. The increasing access to and reliance on digital media to receive and produce information have increased the possibilities for States and private sector companies to track individuals‚Äô behaviors, opinions and networks. States have increasingly adopted laws and policies to legalize monitoring of communication, justifying these practices with the need to defend their own citizens and national interests. In parts of Europe, new anti-terrorism laws have enabled a greater degree of government surveillance and an increase in the ability of intelligence authorities to access citizens‚Äô data. While legality is a precondition for legitimate limitations of human rights, the issue is also whether a given law is aligned to other criteria for justification such as necessity, proportionality and legitimate purpose.

The film was based on the Saturday Night Live (SNL) character Pat, created by Sweeney, an androgynous misfit whose sex is never revealed. Dave Foley plays Pat's partner, Chris, and Charles Rocket, another SNL alumnus, plays Pat's neighbor, Kyle Jacobsen. Plot Pat Riley is a chubby, whiny, and obnoxious job-hopper of indeterminate gender who is searching for a steady foundation in life. Pat encounters Chris, whose sex is also unrevealed. The two fall in love, and get engaged. Meanwhile, Pat's neighbor, Kyle Jacobsen, develops an unhealthy obsession with unveiling Pat's sex, and begins stalking Pat. Kyle sends in a tape of Pat performing karaoke to a TV show called America's Creepiest People, bringing Pat to the attention of the band Ween, who feature Pat in one of their performances; Pat plays the tuba. When Pat learns that Ween intended to only use Pat for one gig, Pat and Chris break up. Kyle steals the laptop containing Pat's diary and tries to coerce Pat into revealing the computer's password, so he can access the files. Pat's only answer is that the word is in the dictionary. Kyle then begins to type in every single word in the dictionary. Meanwhile, a gang of thugs intent on discovering Pat's sex begin harassing Pat, and Pat becomes distraught over the thugs' androgynous nature. Pat goes to complain to Kathy, a friend who is a therapist and host of a radio talk show. When Pat gives acerbic reactions to call-in listeners, the station fires Kathy and replaces her with Pat. Kyle ends up going through the entire dictionary until he reaches the last word, \\"zythum\\" (an Egyptian malt beer), which is the password. After reading through the diary, he discovers no new information in regards to Pat's sex, and finally snaps. Kyle calls into Pat's radio show, and tells Pat to meet him at the Ripley's Believe It or Not! Museum, stating that this is the only chance for Pat to retrieve the laptop. Pat arrives to find Kyle dressed exactly like Pat. Kyle demands that Pat strip naked, but Pat runs off into a Ween concert. After Kyle corners Pat on a catwalk, Pat falls, and Pat's clothes get caught on a hook. This tears off Pat's pants and lowers Pat in front of the cheering audience, though Pat's genitals are revealed neither to Kyle nor to the moviegoer. Kyle is subsequently taken away by security guards. Pat then runs to see Chris, just as Chris is leaving on an ocean liner. In an epilogue, Pat and Chris get married. During the end credits, Kathy is now hosting her radio show again and the first caller is none other than Kyle, whose obsession with Pat has driven him to cross-dressing.

Three months before the film's release, Sweeney commented on her initial reluctance to do a film based on Pat:Up From the Tube, but Then Down the Drain, a May 1994 article from The New York Times :I resisted it completely. I just didn't know how we could make it last for two hours. But 20th Century Fox was really keen; our producer was really keen. So we thought, OK, we'll write the script. And after three months, we fell madly in love with the script. Unfortunately, Fox did not. Touchstone Pictures decided to produce the film, after Fox bowed out. Quentin Tarantino revealed that he was an uncredited writer on the script. Reception It's Pat has a rare 0% rating on Rotten Tomatoes, based on 11 reviews. Variety magazine called the film \\"shockingly unfunny\\", noting that Sweeney had \\"perversely turned the relatively harmless TV character into a boorish, egotistical creep for the bigscreen\\", the film's \\"only really funny bit is Sexual Personae author Camille Paglia, deftly parodying herself, commenting on the significance of Pat's androgyny\\". Kevin Thomas of the Los Angeles Times wrote: \\"It's Pat offers a simple message of self-acceptance, asserting that what counts is who you are rather than what your gender may or may not be. The trouble is that its telling is truly terrible.\\" TV Guide called it \\"yet another tepid film comedy based on a recurring \\"Saturday Night Live\\" sketch\\". They conclude \\"the story goes nowhere, and if the film ran longer than its 80 minutes, it would have become too tedious to tolerate\\". The film opened in only three citiesHow I Spent My Cancer Vacation, a December 1996 article from Time magazine (33 theaters). Its total gross was $60,822. As a result, the film was pulled from theaters after its opening weekend. =Accolades= It's Pat was a multiple 3rd place nominee at the 16th Golden Raspberry Awards, though the film's cast and crew lost in every category to Showgirls: * Worst Actress - Julia Sweeney * Worst New Star - Julia Sweeney * Worst Picture - Charles B. Wessler * Worst Screen Couple - Dave Foley and Julia Sweeney * Worst Screenplay - Jim Emerson, Stephen Hibbert, and Julia Sweeney At the 1995 Stinkers Bad Movie Awards, the film was nominated for Worst Picture but lost to Showgirls. However, Julia Sweeney did win Worst Actress for this film. Later, the Stinkers released their user-constructed \\"100 Years, 100 Stinkers\\" list in which visitors determined the 100 worst movies of the 20th century. It's Pat ranked in the bottom 20 at #7.

Operational Group (, abbreviated GO) was the highest level of tactical division of the Polish Army before and during World War II and the invasion of Poland. It was corps-sized, although various Operational Groups varied in size. Operational groups first appeared in Polish tactical scheme during the Polish-Bolshevik War, most probably under the influence of French Military Mission to Poland. After the war they were dissolved. Prior to World War II, the operational groups were recreated. Initially, in March 1939, they consisted only of staffs formed around existing corps commands. According to the Polish mobilization scheme, they were to become mobile reserves of the Polish armies and other major strategic-scale units. One of such groups, the Kutno Operational Group, was planned but never created. Also, in the autumn of 1938, the Independent Operational Group Silesia was created with the purpose of capturing Zaolzie from Czechoslovakia. Some groups were formed during the final mobilization of late August 1939, others were formed during the war as strategic considerations necessitated. Most were attached to armies, several however were independent. * Independent Operational Groups # Independent Operational Group \\"Polesie\\" (Samodzielna Grupa Operacyjna Narew) under gen.

In 1967 it reported 572 million net ton-miles of revenue freight, including 107 million in \\"lake transfer service\\"; that total does not include the 39-mile subsidiary Manistique and Lake Superior Railroad. History The railroad company was chartered September 21, 1895, as successor to the Toledo, Ann Arbor and North Michigan Railway. In 1905, it was acquired by the Detroit, Toledo & Ironton Railway (DTI) and Eugene Zimmerman assumed presidency of both lines. DTI went bankrupt three years later. Zimmerman remained president until 1909 when he lost control of the line to Joseph Ramsey, Jr. and Newman Erb. Ramsey assumed the presidency, serving until 1913 when Erb became president and ran the line for the next eleven years. Erb also served as president of the Minneapolis and St. Louis Railway 1912 to 1916. The company ended its last passenger train, a once a day train in each direction train from the AA's Toledo station to its Elberta boat landing, on July 19, 1950. Major stops on the route besides the end points included Ann Arbor, Durand, Owosso and Cadillac. The passenger side was hampered by the limited number of noteworthy cities en route and the fact that all but the Durand Union Station were in cities in which trains for connecting points were at different stations from the AA station, thus necessitating use of surface transportation for transfer between train stations.Official Guide of the Railways, January 1950, Ann Arbor sectionAmerican Rails, \\"Ann Arbor Railroad\\" https://www.american- rails.com/ann.html For many years the Ann Arbor was owned by the Wabash Railroad, but Wabash gave up control in 1963 as part of its absorption into the Norfolk and Western. The DT&I;, by then itself owned by the giant Pennsylvania Railroad, again gained control in 1963. The combined DT&I; and AA were operated as independent subsidiaries of the PRR but suffered from the parent company's ill-fated 1968 merger with the New York Central. Upon the resulting Penn Central's 1970 bankruptcy, the DT&I; and its Ann Arbor subsidiary were sold off to private investors. The Ann Arbor Railroad owned a subsidiary, the Manistique and Lake Superior Railroad (M&LS;), from somewhere shortly after that line's origin in 1909 until it was abandoned in 1968. After itself going bankrupt in 1973 the Ann Arbor ceased operations as a railroad on April 1, 1976, when the Consolidated Rail Corporation (Conrail) temporarily took over. Since Conrail only wished to operate the south end of the AA, the state of Michigan acquired the entire line, and operations were transferred to the Michigan Interstate Railway, a division of the Michigan Department of Transportation (MDOT), on October 1, 1977. The state eventually privatized this entity, selling it off in pieces to several different short-line railroad companies. On October 7, 1988, a new Ann Arbor Railroad began operating the portion south of Ann Arbor; the Great Lakes Central Railroad now serves the remaining portions of the line. Some sections have been abandoned: from Yuma to Elberta and Frankfort (approximately 45 miles), about 10 miles in Shiawassee County, Michigan (in three discontinuous sections), and the trackage around the now-demolished Cherry Street Station in Toledo. Train ferries The Ann Arbor's Lake Michigan train ferry fleet at Elberta started in November 1892 when the Toledo, Ann Arbor and Northern Michigan Railway acquired its first two boats, Ann Arbor 1 and Ann Arbor 2. At its height, the AA served four ports on the west of Lake Michigan: *Kewaunee, Wisconsin, from 1892 connecting with Kewaunee, Green Bay and Western Railroad, *Menominee, Michigan, from 1894 connecting with Chicago, Milwaukee and St. Paul Railway, Chicago and North Western Railway, and Wisconsin and Michigan Railroad *Gladstone, Michigan in Michigan Upper Peninsula, from 1895 connecting with the Minneapolis, St. Paul and Sault Ste. Marie Railroad. Later moved to Manistique, Michigan, connecting with Duluth, South Shore and Atlantic Railway via AA subsidiary Manistique and Lake Superior Railroad *Manitowoc, Wisconsin, from 1896 connecting with Chicago and North Western Railway, and Wisconsin Central Railway =Fleet= Altogether, eight boats were built for service with the AA and one was leased from the Grand Trunk Milwaukee Car Ferry Company. * ‚Äì designed by Frank E.

The range is highly localised, confined to a small area of high summits in the northern Sierra Madre Oriental in Coahuila and Nuevo Le√≥n, and only abundant on the highest peak, Cerro Potos√≠ (3713 m). It occurs at very high altitudes, from 3000‚Äì3700 m, in cool, moist subalpine climate conditions. Description It is a medium-size shrub, reaching 1.5‚Äì5 m tall and with a trunk diameter of up to 25 cm. The bark is grey-brown, thin and scaly at the base of the trunk. The leaves ('needles') are in fascicles of five, slender, 3‚Äì5.5 cm long, and deep green to blue-green, with stomata confined to a bright white band on the inner surfaces. The cones are globose, 3‚Äì4 cm long and broad when closed, green at first, ripening yellow-brown when 16‚Äì18 months old, with only a small number of thin, fragile scales, typically 6‚Äì14 fertile scales. The cones open to 4‚Äì6 cm broad when mature, holding the seeds on the scales after opening. The seeds are 9‚Äì12 mm long, with a thick shell, a white endosperm, and a vestigial 1‚Äì2 mm wing; they are dispersed by the Clark's nutcracker and Mexican jay, which pluck the seeds out of the open cones. The jays, which uses the seeds as a major food resource, store many of the seeds for later use, and some of these stored seeds are not used and are able to grow into new plants. History Because of its isolation on a handful of remote mountain summits, Potosi pinyon escaped discovery until 1959. It differs from most other pinyon species in needle number, with 5 per fascicle, rather than 1‚Äì4, and in its consistently shrubby stature. It is most closely related to Johann's pinyon and Orizaba pinyon, like them having the leaf stomata confined to the inner faces; it also differs from the latter in its smaller cones and seeds. Like these two, the white-glaucous inner surfaces of the needles make it a very attractive slow-growing shrub, suitable for small gardens. Like other pinyons, the pine nut seeds are edible, but the inaccessibility of the plants prevents significant collection for food.

That winter, Robert Goodwin and Amos Taylor represented Mary Newell against the Oceanic Steam Navigation Company for the sum of $110,400 resulting from the April 15, 1912 sinking of the RMS Titanic. Another case taken on in the firm's early days stemmed from the infamous pyramid scheme orchestrated in Boston by Charles Ponzi. After the scheme was exposed as fraud, Robert Goodwin served as the bankruptcy referee for Middlesex County amid thousands of recovery claims in the bankruptcy courts. When the United States joined the allied cause in World War I in 1917, Robert Goodwin joined the country's vanguard deployment in France, eventually rising to the rank of colonel and assuming command of the 101st Field Artillery. After the campaign, he was awarded the Distinguished Service Medal. Not long after, Samuel Hoar V, a litigator, was hired, followed by Fred Tarbell Field, a well-respected tax lawyer who was a friend of Procter's, and the firm became known as Goodwin, Procter, Field & Hoar. In early 1929, Field was appointed a justice of the Supreme Judicial Court of Massachusetts (and would later become its Chief Justice), and the firm was renamed Goodwin, Procter & Hoar, a name it would retain for the next 72 years. The Depression years proved pivotal for the firm's future diversification and growth. Liquidation cases, including the unwinding of the Boston Continental Bank, provided a surge of business, as did the proliferation of federal agencies and regulations brought on by the New Deal. Around the same time, Greater Boston's manufacturing and maritime industries faded and the financial management industry expanded, presenting new opportunities for work on highly complex financial transactions. Goodwin Procter also undertook matters involving public service and public policy, including public investigations of corruption and malfeasance, as well as cases with constitutional overtones. When the Massachusetts governor pardoned New England Mafia boss Raymond Patriarca in 1938, the resulting public furor led the Legislature to establish a commission to investigate the state's pardon and parole procedures. Sam Hoar, with Don Hurley as his lieutenant, headed the commission, whose resulting investigation led to reform of the pardon laws and impeachment of a member of the Governor's Council. More than 70 years later, the Commonwealth would once again call on Goodwin Procter lawyers to examine alleged corruption in the state's parole office. After World War II, partners Leonard Wheeler and Frank Wallis played instrumental roles in the historic Nuremberg Trials, presenting much of the Americans' case against the Nazis. \\"It was a most amazing and thrilling experience,\\" recalled Wallis. \\"I was speaking to the world - not only the world of today but the world of future generations.\\" Post-war practice would not be business as usual as the firm reached a generational turning point, with Robert Goodwin entering semi-retirement and Sam Hoar's passing in 1952. (Joe Procter had died earlier in 1932.) Goodwin formally retired in 1963, ending a 60-year legal career; he died in 1971. In 1960, tax partners Allan Higgins and Charlie Post helped draft and secure passage of the Real Estate Investment Trust Act, which was hailed as a significant catalyst for real estate development across the country. In 1963, partner Don Hurley played a role in conceiving, drafting and securing passage of an amendment to the Bank Holding Company Act exempting parent companies of single banks and non-banking subsidiaries from federal restrictions on commercial banks. In 1969, after more than a half-century in the India Building at 84 State Street, the firm moved to a new office tower at 28 State, where it would remain for 16 years before moving to Exchange Place at 53 State Street in 1985. To celebrate its 75th anniversary in 1987, the firm made a donation of $1 million to the City of Boston to fund initiatives in public education. The donation, called SEED (Support for Early Educational Development), was made up entirely of individual contributions by the firm's partners. With 280 lawyers, Goodwin Procter entered the 1990s as the ‚Äúlargest law firm under one roof in the country,‚Äù according to Massachusetts Lawyers Weekly. The firm made its first foray outside Boston in 1994 with an office in Washington, D.C., followed by one in New York in 1997. The acquisition of 27 lawyers from a northern New Jersey firm and 13 litigators from a New York products liability shop bolstered the firm's IP and litigation practices in New York. In 1998, Regina Pisa became the first woman to be named Chairman and Managing Partner of an AmLaw 100 firm. Under Pisa's leadership, Goodwin grew from 300 lawyers primarily in Boston to more than 900 lawyers serving clients from eight locations in the United States, Europe and Asia. In 2004, the firm merged with the Washington, D.C.-based litigation and regulatory mid-sized firm Shea & Gardner. The following year over 60 attorneys from Testa, Hurwitz & Thibeault joined Goodwin Procter as Testa Hurwitz dissolved,Kimberly Blanton, How Goodwin Procter won many of Testa's law partners, Boston.com, February 6, 2005 a move the Boston Globe called possibly \\"the biggest coup in Boston legal history.\\"Kimberly Blanton, How Goodwin Procter won many of Testa's law partners, Boston.com, February 6, 2005 Goodwin first established its West Coast presence in 2006, opening offices in Los Angeles and San Francisco. It launched its Silicon Valley presence in 2007. The firm went global in 2008 with offices in London and Hong Kong. At its century mark in 2012, Goodwin had 850 lawyers and another 720 professional staff serving clients from offices in the United States, Europe and Asia. As part of its centennial celebrations, the firm started its Annual Days of Service tradition, during which employees in each office give back to their communities. In 2015, Goodwin announced the opening of an office in Frankfurt, Germany. In April 2016, Goodwin opened its third European office in Paris, France. Later that year, the firm moved its Boston home to 100 Northern Avenue in the city's Seaport District after more than 100 years at the corner of State and Congress Streets. Two years later, Goodwin announced a significant expansion of its European Private Equity and Private Investment Funds practices with a group comprising the bulk of the market-leading and former SJ Berwin investment funds team. In 2019, Goodwin opened new offices in Santa Monica, Luxembourg and Cambridge. Rankings and Reputation Goodwin has been consistently ranked as one of the most prestigious law firms in the United States. The firm ranks 26th on the American Lawyer‚Äôs annual ranking of U.S. law firms by gross revenue, and its lawyers and practice groups are consistently recognized by Chambers, U.S. News and World Report, and Legal 500.

It has been mainly influenced by Turkish and a series of European cuisines in particular from the Balkans, or Hungarian cuisine as well as culinary elements stemming from the cuisines of the Slavic-speaking countries of Eastern and Central Europe. Romanian cuisine includes numerous holiday dishes arranged according to the mentioned season and holiday since the country has its roots in the Eastern Orthodox Church. Romanian dishes consist of vegetables, cereals, vegetable oils, milk, dairy products and meat. There are quite a few different types of dishes, which are sometimes included under a generic term; for example, the category ciorbƒÉ includes a wide range of soups with a characteristic sour taste. These may be meat and vegetable soups, tripe (ciorbƒÉ de burtƒÉ) and calf foot soups, or fish soups, all of which are soured by lemon juice, sauerkraut juice, vinegar, or bor»ô (traditionally made from bran). The category »õuicƒÉ (plum brandy) is a name for a strong alcoholic spirit in Romania. History In the history of Romanian culinary literature, Costache Negruzzi and Mihail KogƒÉlniceanu were the compilers of a cookbook \\"200 re»õete cercate de bucate, prƒÉjituri »ôi alte trebi gospodƒÉre»ôti\\" (200 tried recipes for dishes, pastries and other household things) printed in 1841.Bogdan Ulmu: Re»õete de la KogƒÉlniceanu & Negruzzi  Bucatarescu Also, Negruzzi writes in \\"Alexandru LƒÉpu»ôneanu\\": \\"In Moldavia, at this time, fine food wasn't fashioned. The greatest feast only offered a few types of dishes. After the Polish bor»ô, Greek dishes would follow, boiled with herbs floating in butter, after that, Turkish pilaf, and finally cosmopolitan steaks\\".\\"Lumea\\" nr 17,1946,p 1,Art:O carte de bucate, G. CƒÉlinescu Cheese has been a part of Romanian cuisine since ancient history. Br√¢nzƒÉ is the generic term for cheese in Romanian; it is originally a Dacian word. Traditional Dacian cuisine included vegetables (lentils, peas, spinach, garlic) and fruits (grapes, apples, raspberries) with high nutritional values.\\"Alimenta»õia la daci\\", Dracones.ro The Dacians produced wine in massive quantities. Once, Burebista, a Dacian king, angered by the wine abuse of his warriors, cut down the vines; his people gave up drinking wine.Strabo, Geography, VII:3.11 Romans helped introduce different pastries made with cheese, including alivenci, pascƒÉ, or br√¢nzoaice. They also introduced different variations of millet porridge. Maize and potatoes became staples of Romanian cuisine after their introduction to Europe. Maize, in particular, contributed to health and nutrition improvements of Romanians in the 16th and 17th centuries, resulting in a population boom. For more than four centuries, Wallachia and Moldavia, the two medieval Romanian principalities, were strongly influenced by their neighbor, the Ottoman Empire. Ottoman cuisine changed the Romanian table with appetizers made from various vegetables, such as eggplant and bell peppers, as well as various meat preparations, such as chiftele (deep-fried meatballs, a variation of kofta) and mici (short sausages without casings, usually barbecued). The various kinds of ciorbƒÉ/bor»ô (sour soups) and meat-and-vegetable stews, such as iahnie de fasole (beans), ardei umplu»õi (stuffed peppers), and sarmale (stuffed cabbage) are influenced by Turkish cuisine. The Romanian tomato salad is a variation of the Turkish √ßoban salata. Many traditional desserts and pastries combine honey and nuts, such as baclava, sarailie (or seraigli), halva, and rahat (Turkish delight). Description Romanian recipes bear the same influences as the rest of Romanian culture. The Turks brought meatballs (peri»ôoare in a meatball soup), from the Greeks there is musaca, from the Austrians there is the »ôni»õel, and the list could continue. The Romanians share many foods with the Balkan area (in which Turkey was the cultural vehicle), and Eastern Europe (including Moldova and Ukraine). Some others are original or can be traced to the Romans, as well as other ancient civilizations. The lack of written sources in Eastern Europe makes it impossible to determine today the exact origin for most of them. One of the most common meals is the mƒÉmƒÉligƒÉ, the precursor of polenta, served on its own or as an accompaniment. Pork is the main meat used in Romanian cuisine, but also beef is consumed and a good lamb or fish dish is never to be refused. Before Christmas, on December 20 (Ignat's Day or Ignatul in Romanian),Ignatul or Ignat's Day (December 20) a pig is traditionally sacrificed by every rural family.Christmas customs in Romania: \\"pig's ritual sacrifice\\" A variety of foods for Christmas are prepared from the slaughtered pig, such as: * C√¢rna»õi ‚Äì garlicky pork sausages, which may be smoked or dry-cured; * LebƒÉr ‚Äì an emulsified sausage based on liver with the consistency of the filling ranging from fine (p√¢t√©) to coarse; * S√¢ngerete (black pudding) ‚Äì an emulsified sausage obtained from a mixture of pig's blood with fat and meat, breadcrumbs or other grains, and spices; * TobƒÉ (head cheese) ‚Äì based on pig's feet, ears, and meat from the head suspended in aspic and stuffed in the pig's stomach; * TochiturƒÉ ‚Äì a stew made with pork, smoked and fresh sausage simmered in a tomato sauce and served with mƒÉmƒÉligƒÉ and wine (\\"so that the pork can swim\\"). There are many variations of this stew throughout Romania, with some versions combining different meats, including chicken, lamb, beef, pork and sometimes even offal; * Pomana porcului‚Äîpan-fried cubed pork served right after the pig's sacrifice to thank the relatives and friends who helped with the process; * Piftie/rƒÉciturƒÉ ‚Äì inferior parts of the pig, mainly the tail, feet, and ears, spiced with garlic and served in aspic; * JumƒÉri ‚Äì dried pork remaining from rendering of the fat and tumbled through various spices The Christmas meal is sweetened with the traditional cozonac, a sweet bread made with nuts, poppy seeds, or rahat (Turkish delight). At Easter, lamb is served: the main dishes are bor»ô de miel (lamb sour soup), roast lamb, and drob de miel ‚Äì a Romanian-style lamb haggis made from minced offal (heart, liver, lungs), lamb meat and spring onions with spices, wrapped in a caul and roasted.Making lamb drobTraditional recipe for drob de miel, with step-by-step photos The traditional Easter cake is pascƒÉ, a pie made from yeast dough with a sweet cottage cheese filling at the center.A photo of pascaPasca recipe Romanian pancakes, called clƒÉtite, are thin (like the French cr√™pe) and can be prepared with savory or sweet fillings: ground meat, cheese, or jam. Different recipes are prepared depending on the season or the occasion. Wine is the preferred drink, and Romanian wine has a tradition of over three millennia.Educations.com/Study in Romania Romania is currently the world's ninth largest wine producer, and recently the export market has started to grow. Romania produces a wide selection of domestic varieties (FeteascƒÉ, GrasƒÉ, TƒÉm√¢ioasƒÉ, BusuioacƒÉ, and BƒÉbeascƒÉ), as well as varieties from across the world (Italian Riesling, Merlot, Sauvignon blanc, Cabernet Sauvignon, Chardonnay, and Muscat Ottonel). Beer is also highly regarded, generally blonde pilsener beer, made with German influences. There are also Romanian breweries with a long tradition. According to the 2009 data of FAOSTAT, Romania is the world's second largest plum producer (after the United States), and as much as 75% of Romania's plum production is processed into the famous »õuicƒÉ, a plum brandy obtained through one or more distillation steps.»öuica production consumed 75% of Romanian plums in 2003 =Vegetarianism / Veganism= Followers of the Romanian Orthodox Church keep fast during several periods throughout the ecclesiastical calendar amounting to a majority of the year. In the Romanian Orthodox tradition, devotees keep to a diet without any animal products during these times. As a result, vegan foods are abundant in stores and restaurants; however, Romanians may not be familiar with a vegan or vegetarian diet as a full-time lifestyle choice. Many recipes below have vegan versions, and the Vegetables section below contains many common fasting foods.

Despite its name, it is not native to Siberia. Description Growing to tall by wide, it is a bulbous perennial, with two to four strap- shaped leaves appearing in early spring, at the same time as the nodding, blue, bell-shaped flowers. The flowers have six petals and six stamens, and are arranged singly or in racemes of two or three. Petals may be reflexed to the horizontal when sunlight is bright, but are more often cup-shaped. The flowers are usually blue, but those of Scilla siberica var. alba are white. The stamens of Scilla are separate, unlike those of the related genus Puschkinia, which are fused into a tube. The pollen is dark blue. After flowering, the flower stems become limp as capsules (pods) mature. At maturity, the capsules become purple and split open, releasing small, dark brown seeds. When the seeds are mature, the leaves wither and the plant goes dormant until the next spring. Seedlings are hollow-leaved. Cultivation S. siberica is cultivated for its bluebell-like flowers. It naturalizes rapidly from seed. At , it is suitable for planting in grass, and will spread by seed to form large colonies that go dormant by the time grass needs to be mowed. In the Midwestern United States it is becoming invasive in some situations. This plant has gained the Royal Horticultural Society's Award of Garden Merit.

Yesterday and Today) by Christa Winsloe and directed by Leontine Sagan with artistic direction from Carl Froelich, who also funded the film. Winsloe also wrote the screenplay and was on the set during filming. The film remains an international cult classic.  Plot  Manuela von Meinhardis, whose mother had died when she was young and whose father serves in the military, is enrolled at an all-girls boarding school headed by the traditional and iron-fisted Fr√§ulein von Nordeck zur Nidden. Manuela is immediately exposed to the strictness of the school when receiving her uniform and having many of her possessions taken from her. While the other girls at the school receive Manuela with open arms, she still feels very out of place, until she meets Fr√§ulein von Bernburg, a teacher at the school. After witnessing Fr√§ulein von Bernburg's compassion for the other girls, Manuela develops a passionate love for her teacher. The first spark of love begins with a goodnight kiss. While the teacher normally gives all the girls a goodnight kiss on the forehead, Manuela receives one on the lips. There is a meeting asking the teachers in the school and the headmistress. Fr√§ulein von Bernburg advocates using compassion and love when dealing with the students, but is met with disagreement from the headmistress and the other teachers. Fr√§ulein von Bernburg is surprised to learn that Manuela is at the head of every other teachers‚Äô class, but struggles to perform in her own. During class, the girls are reciting from an assigned reading. The girls who are called upon all know their recitations, except Manuela, who cannot concentrate in Fr√§ulein von Bernburg's presence. After class, Fr√§ulein von Bernburg calls for Manuela to meet her in her room. Manuela expects to be punished for not knowing the assigned material, but Fr√§ulein von Bernburg comments on the state of the clothes the girl came to the school with, noting that there were many holes in them. Fr√§ulein von Bernburg then gives one of her own petticoats to Manuela, at which she begins to weep. After much crying, Manuela confesses her love for Fr√§ulein von Bernburg, and the teacher states that she ‚Äúthinks often‚Äù of Manuela but that she cannot give her special treatment because the other girls will be jealous. The girls gather around Ilsa von Westhagen, another student, as she reads aloud a letter to her parents complaining about the conditions at the school. She has a worker at the school smuggle the letter out. The girls are preparing to put on the play Don Carlos by Friedrich Schiller for the birthday of the headmistress. Manuela plays Don Carlos, the lead male role. Ilsa is to play another major role in the play, but is barred from performing after her letter to her parents denouncing the school is returned because of a wrong address. Ilsa packs up to leave the school, but Fr√§ulein von Bernburg convinces her to stay. The girls put on the play for the headmistress and her guests; it is a great success, with a standout performance by Manuela. Fr√§ulein von Bernburg sits in the front row, clearly moved. After the play, the girls all meet for dinner and are served punch with alcohol in it by the kitchen workers. Manuela is shown drinking more than her friends. After much dancing and singing, she declares she wants to make a speech and reveals her feelings for Fr√§ulein von Bernburg to the girls. Without knowing that the headmistress's assistant is in the room, Manuela tells them of the petticoat that Fr√§ulein von Bernburg gave her; she says she believes Fr√§ulein von Bernburg wanted her to wear it and think of her. Then, she declares that she is not afraid of anything or anyone‚Äîyelling it drunkenly in the direction of the headmistress, who has now entered the room. After passing out, Manuela is brought to a room, where no-one is allowed to see her. She is scolded by the headmistress. The headmistress is then informed that the princess is on her way to the school to speak to her. The students and teachers all line up for the arrival of the princess. After observing all the students, she asks to see Manuela. The princess tells Manuela that she knew Manuela's mother and respected her as she was a very devout woman. The princess says that Manuela looks a little pale and asks whether she is sick, at which the headmistress rushes her away and denies any paleness. After the meeting with the princess, the headmistress scolds Fr√§ulein von Bernburg for being too close and compassionate with her students. She also tells her that she is never to speak to Manuela again. When Fr√§ulein von Bernburg leaves the headmistress's office, Manuela is waiting for her. Fr√§ulein von Bernburg tells Manuela to meet her in her room. In her room, Fr√§ulein von Bernburg tells Manuela that while she cares for her, she is to never speak to her again. Manuela responds by saying that she will die. Fr√§ulein von Bernburg tells her not to say such things and sends her away. As Manuela leaves the room, the headmistress arrives to excoriate Fr√§ulein von Bernburg for speaking to Manuela and says that she can no longer be a teacher at the school. Fr√§ulein von Bernburg says that she could not continue there anyway, for she needs to stand for justice and cannot bear to see the girls made into ‚Äúfearful, helpless creatures.‚Äù At this point, the girls and some staff are all looking for Manuela and cannot find her. Manuela has climbed up the main staircase and is ready to jump several stories. Manuela is saved by the other students. The headmistress and Fr√§ulein von Bernburg walk out of Fr√§ulein von Bernburg's room to discover a commotion and are then told that Manuela tried to jump and kill herself. Fr√§ulein von Bernburg observes that the girls stopped a tragedy from occurring, that both she and the headmistress would have regretted the rest of their lives. The movie ends with all the girls watching the headmistress as she slowly walks down the stairwell and down the hall in shaken silence.  Cast  Production Winsloe's stage play had previously appeared under the title ' (Knight N√©restan) in Leipzig with Hertha Thiele and Claire Harden in the lead roles. After Leipzig the play was produced on the stage in Berlin as 'Klaus Johann: Grenze und Halt: Der Einzelne im \\"Haus der Regeln\\". Zur deutschsprachigen Internatsliteratur. Heidelberg: Universit√§tsverlag, 2003 with a different cast and a more prominent lesbian theme, which was again toned down somewhat for the film. Having mostly played the same roles on stage, the cast was able to produce the film at speed and on a low budget of RM55,000. It was largely shot at the Potsdam military orphanage, now a teacher training college for women. Carl Froelich's studio in Berlin-Tempelhof was also used. The film's original working title was ' (Yesterday and Today) but this was thought too insipid and changed to increase the chances of box-office success. Although sound had only been used for two years in cinema, it was used artfully. The film was groundbreaking in having an all-female cast; in its sympathetic portrayal of lesbian \\"pedagogical eros\\" (see Gustav Wyneken) and homoeroticism, revolving around the passionate love of a fourteen-year-old (Manuela) for her teacher (von Bernburg); and in its co-operative and profit-sharing financial arrangements (although these failed). During an interview about the film decades later, Thiele said: > The whole of ' was set in the Empress Augusta boarding school, where Winsloe > was educated. Actually there really was a Manuela, who remained lame all of > her life after she threw herself down the stairs. She came to the premiere > of the film. I saw her from a distance, and at the time Winsloe told me \\"The > experience is one which I had to write from my heart.\\" Winsloe was a > lesbian. Thiele also said, \\"However, I really don't want to make a great deal of [...] or account for a film about lesbianism here. That's far from my mind, because the whole thing of course is also a revolt against the cruel Prussian education system.\\" After many screen tests, Winsloe had insisted that her friend Thiele play the lead role. Director Sagan preferred Gina Falckenberg who had done the role on stage in Berlin, but along with having played Manuela in Leipzig, Thiele had played a young lesbian in Ferdinand Bruckner's stage play ' (The Creature) and although 23 years old when filming began, she was considered to be more capable of portraying a 14-year-old girl. Reaction The film had some impact in the Berlin lesbian clubs, but was largely eclipsed by the ongoing cult success of Der blaue Engel (1930). The film did however generate large amounts of fan mail to the stars from all over Germany and was considered a success throughout much of Europe. The goodnight kiss Thiele received from Wieck was especially popular: one distributor even asked for more footage of other kisses like it to splice into prints of the film. From its premiere at the Capitol cinema in Berlin until 1934 the film is said to have grossed some RM6,000,000. Despite the collective nature of the filming for which cast and crew received only a quarter of the normal wage, none saw a share of the 6,000,000 marks and Thiele later hinted that the profits had been mostly retained by the producers. The film was distributed outside Germany and was a huge success in Romania. During a 1980 interview Thiele said the school play scene caused a \\"longstockings and kissing\\" cult when the film was first shown there. It was also distributed in Japan, the United States (where it was first banned, then released in a heavily cut version), England and France. ' won the audience referendum for Best Technical Perfection at the Venice Film Festival in 1932 and received the Japanese Kinema Junpo Award for Best Foreign Language Film (Tokyo, 1934). Later, an alternate ending which subtly pandered to pro-Nazi ideals enabled continued screening in German cinemas, but eventually even this version of the film was banned as 'decadent' by the Nazi regime, which reportedly attempted to burn all of the existing prints, but by then several had been dispersed around the world. Sagan and many others associated with the film fled Germany soon after the banning. Many of the cast and crew were Jewish, and those who could not escape from Germany died in the camps. \\"You were only first aware that they were Jewish when fascism was there and you lost your friends,\\" said Thiele, who left Germany in 1937. Assistant director Walter Supper killed himself when it became clear his Jewish wife would be arrested. Despite its later banning, ' was followed by several German films about intimate relationships among women, such as ' (Eight Girls in a Boat, 1932) and Anna and Elizabeth (1933), which also starred Wieck and Thiele but was banned by the Nazis soon after its opening night, along with Ich f√ºr dich, du f√ºr mich (Me for You, You for Me, 1934). The film is said to have inspired the 1949 novel Olivia by Dorothy Bussy, which treats very similar themes, and which was made into a French film Olivia (1951) directed by Jacqueline Audry. Also in 1951, a Mexican adaptation Girls in Uniform was made. There was a German remake in 1958, directed by G√©za von Radv√°nyi and starring Lilli Palmer, Romy Schneider, and Therese Giehse. Censorship and surviving version The film almost was banned in the U.S., but Eleanor Roosevelt spoke highly of the film, resulting in the film getting a limited release in the US in 1932‚Äì33. Prints of the film survived the war, but it was censored heavily until the 1970s, and it was not shown again in Germany until 1977 when it was screened on television there. In 1978, Janus Films and Arthur Krim arranged for a limited re-release in the US in 35mm, including a screening at the Roxie Cinema in San Francisco. Also in 1978, the film was released in its surviving form by Janus Films on VHS with English subtitles. Versions were released in the U.S. (1994) and the UK (2000) by the British Film Institute. Even this version is probably missing some brief scenes. For a full understanding of what may have been censored, a viewing of the film might be followed with a reading of the 1933 novel by Christa Winsloe '/The Child Manuela (Virago Press, 1994). Quotation from the film *\\"What you call sin, I call the great spirit of love, which takes a thousand forms.\\" (Spoken in reference to the boycott.) In popular culture * In Anthony Powell's novel The Acceptance World (1955), the narrator, Nick Jenkins, is re-united with his first major love, Jean Templer, after Jean and her sister-in-law, Mona, have returned to the Ritz (London) on New Year's Eve 1931, following a screening of the film. Jean is accompanied by her brother Peter. Nick (who has seen the film) is mildly mocked by his old schoolfriend Peter (who has not), for saying that the film is not primarily about lesbians. * In the film Henry & June (1990), this is one of the films shown in the small art-house theater frequented by the main characters. *The film Loving Annabelle (2006) was reportedly inspired by M√§dchen in Uniform. *The album M√§dchen in Uniform (2009) by the Austrian band Nachtmahr.

Other players attempt to knock the current King off the pile and take their place, thus becoming the new King of the Hill. The way the \\"king\\" can be removed from the hill depends largely on the rules determined by the players before the game starts. Ordinarily pushing is the most common way of removing the king from the hill, but there are significantly rougher variations where punching or kicking is allowed. As such, the game is often banned from schools. King of the Hill is a method of play in airsoft and the \\"woodsball\\" variant of paintball, as well as in various first-person shooter videogames.  Rules  There are many versions of the game. The most famous one has this rules: = Classical version = # King is the person that was the first to get on the hill at the start # To become a king, you need to go up the hill and push the king off # At the end, the king wins = Team version = In this version, there are two or more opponent teams # King is the leader of the first team to get up the hill at the start # To become the king, the leader of a team (opponent) must get on the hill and push the king off # Allies of the king (his team) can push opponents and enemies off and allies of the opponents (enemies) can push off allies but not the king # At the end, the king and his allies win = \\"Royal family\\" version = In this version, there is not just the king, but all his family, teams of 4. # King, queen, prince and princess are the team who gets on the hill first # Other team's people can push off their respective counterpart on the hill and become the \\"royal\\" role. #As a king or queen, you have the possibility to \\"kick\\" an opponent team's person from the hill and it will go back to his team, putting the king/queen's family one Use as a metaphor The name of the game has become a common metaphor for any sort of competitive zero-sum game or social activity in which a single winner is chosen from among multiple competitors, and a hierarchy is devised by the heights the competitors achieve on the hill (what Howard Bloom called \\"the pecking order\\" in his book The Lucifer Principle), and where winning can only be achieved at the cost of displacing the previous winner.See, for example, a sermon delivered by Rev. Richard Fairchild, 2003 (accessed October 28, 2006) Rev. Fairchild defined \\"king of the hill\\" as \\"the game where the strongest pushes everyone else off the hill\\". In sports In tennis, a variation of this concept manifests in the recreational game alternately titled King of the Court. In this game, one player is designated as the \\"king/queen\\" and occupies one side of the court. The other players line up single file on the other side. One challenger steps up and plays out a single point against the ‚Äúking.‚Äù The point can be started with either a serve or a drop hit. If the challenger wins, they replace the ‚Äúking‚Äù on the other side of the court and become the new king. Variations of this game include the challenger having to win two or three points in a row. This game practices playing a singles point. In video gaming The concept of \\"King of the Hill\\" in video gaming was introduced by Core War players who would pit their warriors against each other's in a fight for survival. King of the Hill tournaments have existed for Core War since the 1980s. King of the Hill has been featured as a game variant in many video games, especially first-person shooters like Halo: Combat Evolved and the more traditional Perfect Dark and more recently Gears of War 2. One of the games that made this mode very popular is Team Fortress 2. Overwatch has a mode called Control which takes the King of the Hill mechanics. It's also an option in some top-down games, such as many of those in the Army Men series. In these versions of the game, a player or team of players must keep control of a specific area or object (not necessarily a literal hill) for a predetermined amount of time. When that amount of time is reached, the round either ends or a new area is designated on the map. In the virtual variant, players are generally removed from the hill by killing them.

It was founded in 1912 by Mary Kimball Morgan with the purpose of \\"serving the Cause of Christian Science.\\"Mary Kimball Morgan, Education at The Principia, The Principia Corporation, 2000, p. 227. It has no affiliation with the Church of Christ, Scientist, but according to the college \\"the practice of Christian Science is the cornerstone of campus life.\\" Students and staff are expected to be practicing Christian Scientists. Principia sits on bluffs overlooking the Mississippi River between Alton and Grafton in the Metro East region of Southern Illinois, thirty miles north of St. Louis. A portion of the school's campus is a designated National Historic Landmark District, for its many buildings and design by architect Bernard Maybeck. History Although Principia College was born out of The Principia, founded by Mary Kimball Morgan in 1897, the name Principia was not adopted until the year 1898. As Morgan's school grew, the founder of Christian Science, Mary Baker Eddy, approved The Principia's reference as a Christian Science school. Emerging from the Principia Lower, Middle, and Upper Schools founded between 1898 and 1906, Principia College was established with a purpose of \\"serving the Cause of Christian Science through appropriate channels open to it as an educational institution.\\"Education at The Principia, by Mary Kimball Morgan The college, however, has no official affiliation with the Christian Science Church and Christian Science is not taught as a subject, but its principles form the basis of community life at Principia. The first Upper School class graduated in 1906 and it is from this class that a junior college was established, whose first alumni graduated in 1917. Principia College has been accredited by the Higher Learning Commission since 1923.The Higher Learning Commission. Retrieved January 23, 2015. 406x406px Following this time period, architect Bernard Maybeck was commissioned to design a new college campus in Elsah, Illinois and by 1931 ground was broken on what would become Maybeck's largest commission. In 1934, Principia College graduated its first class as a full four-year institution and in 1935 the college was officially moved to its present-day location in Elsah. On April 19, 1993, about of the campus was designated a National Historic Landmark by the United States Department of the Interior. The year 1998 marked centennial celebrations by the school. The Principia College campus was once considered as the site for the United States Air Force Academy though ultimately the Air Force chose a location in Colorado Springs, Colorado, instead. Academics Principia College offers twenty-seven majors in the liberal arts and sciences. The college does not currently offer a graduate program. The most popular majors include mass communication, biology, sociology, anthropology, studio and fine art, and business administration. Principia offers various Study Abroad & Field Programs, International Student Programs, Conferences, and International Student Experiences. In their 2019 rankings, U.S. News & World Report ranked Principia #83 (up from #139 in 2014) among all National Liberal Arts Colleges, and #5 in the category of \\"Best Value Schools\\". As of 2019, Principia College's annual tuition costs were $29,470, with additional costs of $11,610 for room and board (99% of freshmen lived on campus in 2018-19). In 2017, the school had an acceptance rate above 90%.

The first six mentioned were designed by former University of California, Berkeley professor and AIA Gold Medal winner Bernard Maybeck in 1935, as was the campus' chapel. Maybeck attempted to use different architectural styles and building techniques for each of these dormitories and for the chapel. In an effort to ensure success with his designs and materials, he experimented with them through the creation of a small building known affectionately by Principians as the \\"Mistake House.\\"KETC: Living St. Louis: The Architecture of Principia College In celebration of the 2018 Illinois Bicentennial, the Principia College Campus was selected as one of the Illinois 200 Great Places by the American Institute of Architects Illinois component (AIA Illinois). Student life Principia College has a diverse student composition and amount of organizations given its size. 20% of its students are international and represent thirty countries on six of the world's seven continents. The college has forty student clubs and organizations, among these the Euphrates and Leadership institutes. The Public Affairs Conference at the college is one of oldest student-led conferences in America and has been held annually since 1939. The Principia College Speaker Series is a group of past, present, and future events that has featured United States President Barack Obama, American statesmen and retired four-star general Colin Powell, former United States president George H.W.

The southern terminus is in Manhattan at 57th Street on the northbound side and 56th Street on the southbound side, where the parkway continues south as the West Side Highway. It is often erroneously referred to as the West Side Highway throughout its entire course in Manhattan. The northern terminus is at the Bronx‚ÄìWestchester county boundary, where it continues north as the Saw Mill River Parkway. All but the northernmost mile of the road is co-signed as New York State Route 9A (NY 9A). In addition, the entirety of the parkway is designated New York State Route 907V (NY 907V), an unsigned reference route. The owners of the parkway are the New York State Department of Transportation, New York City Department of Transportation, New York City Department of Parks and Recreation, Metropolitan Transportation Authority, Amtrak, and Port Authority of New York and New Jersey. The Henry Hudson Parkway was created by the Henry Hudson Parkway Authority, which was run by \\"master builder\\" Robert Moses. The highway itself was constructed from 1934‚Äì1937. Route description Henry Hudson Parkway in Upper Manhattan Riverdale The Henry Hudson Parkway begins in Hell's Kitchen at 57th Street on the northbound side and 56th on the southbound side, which also serves as the north end of the West Side Highway and the last remaining section of the West Side Highway's predecessor, the Miller Highway. The junction is numbered as exit 8, continuing the numbering scheme used on the West Side Highway. It heads northward along the west side of Manhattan, connecting to West 79th Street with a large interchange and to other surface streets with more intermittent exits along the way. The parkway continues in a northerly direction, running almost parallel to Riverside Drive north of West 158th Street. It passes under the Trans-Manhattan Expressway (I-95 and U.S. 1) and the George Washington Bridge as it continues its progression through Fort Washington Park, Fort Tryon Park, and Inwood Hill Park. It then runs northward across the Henry Hudson Bridge into the Bronx. Upon entering the Bronx, the parkway passes through Spuyten Duyvil and Riverdale as it continues northward, edging slightly to the northeast. Between Exits 20 and 22, Riverdale Avenue is split into service roads along the parkway. At exit 23, NY 9A leaves the parkway for U.S. Route 9 (US 9) while the parkway enters Van Cortlandt Park. Soon after it enters the park, the parkway has an interchange with the Mosholu Parkway, which connects it to I-87. Less than a mile farther on, the parkway becomes the Saw Mill River Parkway as it enters Westchester County. History Riverdale, 1934 Beginning of Henry Hudson Parkway near 57th Street The Parkway was completed on October 12, 1937, under New York master builder Robert Moses. It cost $109 million, twice as expensive as the $49 million Hoover Dam that was built in the same period. The Parkway was part of Moses's \\"West Side Improvement\\" and included covering the New York Central Railroad's West Side Line, creating the Freedom Tunnel. The covered portion is partially used for the highway and also expands the Riverside Park designed by Frederick Law Olmsted. On May 12, 2005, part of a retaining wall at Castle Village collapsed onto the northbound lanes of the parkway, just north of the George Washington Bridge, shutting it down shortly before rush hour. The clean-up began quickly, and the road re-opened on May 15. Future The Henry Hudson Parkway is a candidate for designation as a New York State Scenic Byway, the first in New York City. At the request of the Henry Hudson Parkway Task Force, in 2005 the New York Metropolitan Transportation Council approved funding to develop a comprehensive corridor management plan, a requirement for its designation.

Colloquially known as \\"father of the Indian nuclear programme\\", Bhabha was also the founding director of the Atomic Energy Establishment, Trombay (AEET) which is now named the Bhabha Atomic Research Centre in his honour. TIFR and AEET were the cornerstone of Indian development of nuclear weapons which Bhabha also supervised as director. Bhabha was awarded the Adams Prize (1942) and Padma Bhushan (1954). He was also nominated for the Nobel Prize for Physics in 1951 and 1953‚Äì1956. Early life and education Homi Jehangir Bhabha was born into a prominent wealthy Parsi family, through which he was related to businessmen Dinshaw Maneckji Petit, and Dorabji Tata. He was born on 30 October 1909. His father was Jehangir Hormusji Bhabha, a well known Parsi lawyer and his mother was Meheren.> He received his early studies at Bombay's Cathedral and John Connon School and entered Elphinstone College at age 15 after passing his Senior Cambridge Examination with Honours. He then attended the Royal Institute of Science in 1927 before joining Caius College of Cambridge University. This was due to the insistence of his father and his uncle Dorabji, who planned for Bhabha to obtain a degree in mechanical engineering from Cambridge and then return to India, where he would join the Tata Steel or Tata Steel Mills in Jamshedpur as a metallurgist. =Research= Bhabha's father understood his son's predicament, and he along with his wife agreed to finance his studies in mathematics provided that he obtain first class on his Mechanical Sciences Tripos exam. Bhabha took the Tripos exam in June 1930 and passed with first class. Afterwards, he excelled in his mathematical studies under Paul Dirac to complete the Mathematics Tripos. Meanwhile, he worked at the Cavendish Laboratory while working towards his doctorate in theoretical physics. At the time, the laboratory was the centre of a number of scientific breakthroughs. James Chadwick had discovered the neutron, John Cockcroft and Ernest Walton transmuted lithium with high-energy protons, and Patrick Blackett and Giuseppe Occhialini used cloud chambers to demonstrate the production of electron pairs and showers by gamma radiation. During the 1931‚Äì1932 academic year, Bhabha was awarded the Salomons Studentship in Engineering. In 1932, he obtained first class on his Mathematical Tripos and was awarded the Rouse Ball travelling studentship in mathematics. During this time, nuclear physics was attracting the greatest minds and it was one of the most significantly emerging fields as compared to theoretical physics, the opposition towards theoretical physics attacked the field because it was lenient towards theories rather than proving natural phenomenon through experiments. Conducting experiments on particles which also released enormous amounts of radiation, was a lifelong passion of Bhabha, and his leading edge research and experiments brought great laurels to Indian physicists who particularly switched their fields to nuclear physics, one of the most notable being Piara Singh Gill. =Work in nuclear physics= In January 1933, Bhabha received his doctorate in nuclear physics after publishing his first scientific paper, \\"The Absorption of Cosmic radiation\\". In the publication, Bhabha offered an explanation of the absorption features and electron shower production in cosmic rays. The paper helped him win the Isaac Newton Studentship in 1934, which he held for the next three years. The following year, he completed his doctoral studies in theoretical physics under Ralph H. Fowler. During his studentship, he split his time working at Cambridge and with Niels Bohr in Copenhagen. In 1935, Bhabha published a paper in the Proceedings of the Royal Society, Series A, in which he performed the first calculation to determine the cross section of electron-positron scattering. Electron-positron scattering was later named Bhabha scattering, in honour of his contributions in the field. In 1936, with Walter Heitler, he co- authored a paper, \\"The Passage of Fast Electrons and the Theory of Cosmic Showers\\" in the Proceedings of the Royal Society, Series A, in which they used their theory to describe how primary cosmic rays from outer space interact with the upper atmosphere to produce particles observed at the ground level. Bhabha and Heitler then made numerical estimates of the number of electrons in the cascade process at different altitudes for different electron initiation energies. The calculations agreed with the experimental observations of cosmic ray showers made by Bruno Rossi and Pierre Victor Auger a few years before. Bhabha later concluded that observations of the properties of such particles would lead to the straightforward experimental verification of Albert Einstein's theory of relativity. In 1937, Bhabha was awarded the Senior Studentship of the 1851 exhibition, which helped him continue his work at Cambridge until the outbreak of World War II in 1939. Return to India In September 1939, Bhabha was in India for a brief holiday when World War II started, and he decided not to return to England for the time being. He accepted an offer to serve as the Reader in the Physics Department of the Indian Institute of Science, then headed by renowned physicist C. V. Raman. He received a special research grant from the Sir Dorab Tata Trust, which he used to establish the Cosmic Ray Research Unit at the Institute. Bhabha selected a few students, including Harish-Chandra, to work with him. Later, on 20 March 1941, he was elected a Fellow of the Royal Society. With the help of J. R. D. Tata, he played an instrumental role in the establishment of the Tata Institute of Fundamental Research in Mumbai. Career Starting his nuclear physics career in Britain, Bhabha had returned to India for his annual vacation before the start of World War II in September 1939. War prompted him to remain in India and he accepted a post of reader in physics at the Indian Institute of Science in Bengaluru, headed by Nobel laureate C.V. Raman. During this time, Bhabha played a key role in convincing the Congress Party's senior leaders, most notably Jawaharlal Nehru who later served as India's first Prime Minister, to start the ambitious nuclear programme. As part of this vision, Bhabha established the Cosmic Ray Research Unit at the Institute, began to work on the theory of point particles movement, while independently conducting research on nuclear weapons in 1944. In 1945, he established the Tata Institute of Fundamental Research in Bombay, and the Atomic Energy Commission in 1948, serving as its first chairman. In 1948, Nehru led the appointment of Bhabha as the director of the nuclear program and tasked Bhabha to develop the nuclear weapons soon after. In the 1950s, Bhabha represented India in IAEA conferences, and served as President of the United Nations Conference on the Peaceful Uses of Atomic Energy in Geneva, Switzerland in 1955. During this time, he intensified his lobbying for the development of nuclear weapons. Soon after the Sino-Indo war, Bhabha aggressively and publicly began to call for the nuclear weapons. Bhabha gained international prominence after deriving a correct expression for the probability of scattering positrons by electrons, a process now known as Bhabha scattering. His major contribution included his work on Compton scattering, R-process, and furthermore the advancement of nuclear physics. He was awarded Padma Bhushan by Government of India in 1954. He later served as the member of the Indian Cabinet's Scientific Advisory Committee and provided the pivotal role to Vikram Sarabhai to set up the Indian National Committee for Space Research. In January 1966, Bhabha died in a plane crash near Mont Blanc, while heading to Vienna, Austria to attend a meeting of the International Atomic Energy Agency's Scientific Advisory Committee. Atomic energy in India Bhabha (right) at the International Conference on the Peaceful Uses of Atomic Energy in Geneva, Switzerland, 20 August 1955 When Homi Jehangir Bhabha was working at the India Institute of Science, there was no institute in India which had the necessary facilities for original work in nuclear physics, cosmic rays, high energy physics, and other frontiers of knowledge in physics. This prompted him to send a proposal in March 1944 to the Sir Dorabji Tata Trust for establishing 'a vigorous school of research in fundamental physics'. In his proposal he wrote: The trustees of Sir Dorabji Jamsetji, Tata Trust, decided to accept Bhabha's proposal and financial responsibility for starting the Institute in April 1944. Bombay was chosen as the location as the Government of Bombay showed interest in becoming a joint founder of the proposed institute. The institute, named Tata Institute of Fundamental Research, was inaugurated in 1945 in 540 square meters of hired space in an existing building. In 1948 the Institute was moved into the old buildings of the Royal Yacht club. When Bhabha realised that technology development for the atomic energy programme could no longer be carried out within TIFR he proposed to the government to build a new laboratory entirely devoted to this purpose. For this purpose, 1200 acres of land was acquired at Trombay from the Bombay Government. Thus the Atomic Energy Establishment Trombay (AEET) started functioning in 1954. The same year the Department of Atomic Energy (DAE) was also established. He represented India in International Atomic Energy Forums, and as President of the United Nations Conference on the Peaceful Uses of Atomic Energy, in Geneva, Switzerland in 1955. He was elected a Foreign Honorary Member of the American Academy of Arts and Sciences in 1958. Nuclear power programme Bhabha is generally acknowledged as the father of Indian nuclear power. Moreover, he is credited with formulating a strategy of focussing on extracting power from the country's vast thorium reserves rather than its meagre uranium reserves. This thorium focused strategy was in marked contrast to all other countries in the world. The approach proposed by Bhabha to achieve this strategic objective became India's three stage nuclear power programme. Bhabha paraphrased the three-stage approach as follows: Death Bhabha was killed when Air India Flight 101 crashed near Mont Blanc on 24 January 1966. Misunderstanding between Geneva Airport and the pilot about the aircraft position near the mountain is the official reason of the crash. =Assassination theories= Many possible theories have been advanced for the air crash, including a claim the Central Intelligence Agency (CIA) was involved in order to paralyse India's nuclear program.Homi Bhabha: The physicist with a difference . News.in.msn.com (23 June 2015). Retrieved on 30 June 2015. An Indian diplomatic bag containing calendars and a personal letter was recovered near the crash site in 2012. Gregory Douglas, a journalist who taped his interviews with former CIA operative, Robert Crowley, for four years, published their transcripts in a book called Conversations with the Crow. Crowley writes that CIA was responsible for assassinating Homi Bhabha. He said that a bomb in the cargo section of the plane exploded mid-air, bringing down the commercial Boeing 707 airliner in Alps with little traces left to be retrieved. He also claimed that the US was aware of Indian nuclear progress. Legacy alt= After his death, the Atomic Energy Establishment at Mumbai was renamed as the Bhabha Atomic Research Centre in his honour. In addition to being an able scientist and administrator, Bhabha was also a painter and a classical music and opera enthusiast, besides being an amateur botanist. He is one of the most prominent scientists that India has ever had. Bhabha also encouraged research in electronics, space science, radio astronomy and microbiology. Bust of Bhabha at Birla Industrial & Technological Museum, Kolkata The famed radio telescope in Ooty, India was his initiative, and it became a reality in 1970. The Homi Bhabha Fellowship Council has been giving Homi Bhabha Fellowships since 1967. Other noted institutions in his name are the Homi Bhabha National Institute, an Indian deemed university and the Homi Bhabha Centre for Science Education, Mumbai, India. At Bhabha's death, his estate including Mehrangir, the sprawling colonial bungalow at Malabar Hill where he spent most of his life, was inherited by his brother Jamshed Bhabha. Jamshed, an avid patron of arts and culture, bequeathed the bungalow and its contents to the National Centre for the Performing Arts, which auctioned the property for Rs 372 crores in 2014 to raise funds for upkeep and development of the centre. The bungalow was demolished in June 2016 by the owner, Smita-Crishna Godrej of the Godrej family, despite some efforts to have it preserved as a memorial to Homi Bhabha.

After a five-year stint at King Abdul Aziz University, Jeddah, Saudi Arabia ‚Äì where he became a leading authority on the hajj, the pilgrimage to Mecca ‚Äî‚Äì he returned to work as Middle East correspondent of the science magazines Nature and New Scientist. In 1982, he joined London Weekend Television as a reporter and helped launch the trend-setting Asian programme Eastern Eye. In the early 1980s, he was among the founders of Inquiry, a magazine of ideas and policy focusing on Muslim countries, which played a major part in promoting reformist thought in Islam. While editing Inquiry, he established the Center for Policy and Futures Studies at East-West University in Chicago. In 1987 Sardar moved to Kuala Lumpur as an advisor to Anwar Ibrahim, the Education Minister. Ibrahim went on to become Deputy Prime Minister of Malaysia and following his imprisonment on fabricated charges, the leader of the Opposition. He came back to London in the late 1990s to work as Visiting Professor of Science Studies at Middlesex University, and write for the New Statesman, where he later became a columnist. In 1999, he was appointed editor of Futures, the monthly journal of policy, planning and futurology, and became involved in Third Text, the prestigious journal of arts and visual culture, which he co-edited till 2005. Also in 1999, he moved to the City University London, London, as Visiting Professor of Postcolonial Studies. From 2001 to 2013, he was Professor of Law and Society in the School of Law at Middlesex University. After leaving London Weekend Television, Sardar wrote and presented a number of programmes for the BBC and Channel 4. He conceived and presented Encounters With Islam for the BBC in 1983, and two years later his 13-half-hour interview series Faces of Islam was broadcast on TV3 (Malaysia) and other channels in Asia. In 1990, he wrote and presented a programme on Islamic science for BBC's Antenna and his six-part Islamic Conversations was broadcast on Channel 4 early in 1995. He wrote and presented the highly acclaimed Battle for Islam, a 90-minute film for BBC2 in 2005. And followed that with Between the Mullahs and the Military, a 50-minute documentary on Pakistan for Channel 4's Dispatches series. Most recently he wrote the three-part one-hour documentary The Life of Muhammad for BBC2, broadcast in July 2011. He has appeared on numerous television programmes, including the Andrew Marr Show and Hard Talk, and was a regular member of the 'Friday Panel' on Sky News World News Tonight during 2006 and 2007. He appears in various filmed philosophical debateshttp://iai.tv/home/speaker/ziauddin- sardar at the Institute of Art and Ideas. Sardar was amongst the first Commissioners of the UK's Equality and Human Rights Commission (March 2005 ‚Äì December 2009); and served as a Member of the Interim National Security Forum at the Cabinet Office, London, during 2009 and 2010. His journalism and reviews have appeared in The Guardian, The Independent, The Times, the UK weekly magazine, New Statesman and the monthly magazine New Internationalist. Sardar's online work includes a year-long project for the Guardian, 'Blogging the Qur'an', published in 2008. In 2009, Sardar re-launched the defunct Muslim Institute as a learned society that supports and promotes the growth of thought, knowledge, research, creativity and open debate; and became the Chair of the reorganized Muslim Institute Trust. He conceived and launched, in 2011, the quarterly Critical Muslim, a ground-breaking journal of freethinking that seeks new readings of Islam and Muslim culture, jointly published by the Muslim Institute and Hurst & Co. In 2014, Sardar re-launched the Center for Policy and Futures Studies at East-West University as The Center for Postnormal Policy and Futures Studies, which focuses more acutely on his recent work on Postnormal Times. National Life Stories conducted an oral history interview (C1672/32) with Ziauddin Sardar in 2016 for its Science and Religion collection held by the British Library.National Life Stories, 'Sardar, Ziauddin (1 of 8) National Life Stories Collection: Science and Religion', The British Library Board, 2016. Retrieved 9 October 2017 Life and thought Sardar has lived the life of a scholar-adventurer and has travelled extensively throughout the world. From 1974 to 1979, he lived in Jeddah, Saudi Arabia, where he worked for the Hajj Research Centre at the King Abdul Aziz University. During this period he travelled throughout the Islamic world researching his first book, Science, Technology and Development in the Muslim World (Croom Helm, 1977). In the early 1980s, he edited the pioneering Muslim magazine 'Inquiry', before establishing the Centre for Policy and Futures Studies at East-West University in Chicago. During the 1990s, he lived in Kuala Lumpur. He has also lived in Chicago and The Hague and for short periods in Cairo and Fez. Sardar describes himself as a 'critical polymath'.http://www.newstatesman.com/writers/ziauddin_sardar His thought is characterised by a strong accent on diversity, pluralism and dissenting perspectives. Science journalist Ehsan Masood suggests that Sardar 'deliberately cultivates a carefully calculated ambiguity projecting several things at once, yet none of them on their own'.Ehsan Masood, 'Introduction: the Ambiguous Intellectual‚Äô, in Ehsan Masood, editor, How Do You Know: Reading Ziauddin Sardar on Islam, Science and Cultural Relations Pluto Press, London, 2006, p1 Futurist Tony Stevenson points out that his 'intellectual aggression' hides a 'sincere and deep humanity': 'while his cultural analysis is surgically incisive, it is largely free of the theoretical correctness of academic thought', while he 'draws on a depth of academic thought', he 'always remains accessible'.Tony Stevenson, ‚ÄòZiauddin Sardar: Explaining Islam to the West‚Äô in Profiles in Courage: Political Actors and Ideas in Contemporary Asia, editors, Gloria Davies, JV D‚ÄôCruz and Nathan Hollier, Australian Scholarly Publishing, Melbourne, 2008, page 80. The fundamental principle of Sardar's thought is that 'there is more than one way to be human'. 'I do not regard \\"the human\\" either as \\"the\\" or as a priori given', he has said. 'The western way of being human is one amongst many. Similarly, the Islamic way of being human is also one amongst many. The Australian aboriginal way of being human is also another way of being human. I see each culture as a complete universe with its own way of knowing, being and doing ‚Äì and hence, its own way of being human'.Ziauddin Sardar interviewed by Tony Fry, ‚ÄòOn Erasure, Appropriation, Transmodernity, What‚Äôs Wrong with Human Rights and What‚Äôs Lies Beyond Difference‚Äô, Design Philosophy Papers Collection Four, edited by Anne-Marie Wallis, Team D/E/S Publications, Ravensbourne, Australia, 2008, 83‚Äì91. The corollary is that there are also different ways of knowing. The question that Sardar has always asked is: 'how do you know? The answer depends a great deal on who 'you' are: 'how you look at the world, how you shape your inquiry, the period and culture that shapes your outlook and the values that frame how you think'.Ehsan Masood, ‚ÄòIntroduction: the Ambiguous Intellectual‚Äô, in Ehsan Masood, editor, How Do You Know: Reading Ziauddin Sardar on Islam, Science and Cultural Relations, Pluto Press, London, 2006. Considered a pioneering writer on Islam and contemporary cultural issues, he has produced some fifty books over a period of 30 years, some with his long-time co-author Merryl Wyn Davies. These books include the classic studies The Future of Muslim Civilisation (1979) and Islamic Futures: The Shape of Ideas to Come (1985), a vigorous intellectual assault on postmodern thought, Postmodernism and the Other (1998) and Orientalism (1999), and the international bestseller Why Do People Hate America? (2002). He has published two highly acclaimed books on cities: The Consumption of Kuala Lumpur (2000) and Mecca: The Sacred City, which won the first prize at the Lahore Literature Festival in 2014 and the Ramnath Goenka Award for Excellence in Journalism for a non-fiction book. Two collections of his essays and critical writings are available as readers: Islam, Postmodernism and Other Futures: A Ziauddin Sardar Reader (2003) and How Do You Know? Reading Ziauddin Sardar on Islam, Science and Cultural Relations (2006). His two volumes of autobiography, Desperately Seeking Paradise: Journeys of a Sceptical Muslim and Balti Britain: A Provocative Journey Through Asian Britain, have been highly praised. His latest book Reading the Qur‚Äôan presents a humanist and pluralist reading of the sacred text of Islam. Sardar's contribution to critical scholarship ranges far and wide, but is particularly relevant in six areas: Islam, Islamic Science, Futures, Postmodernism and Transmodernity, identity and multiculturalism and Postnormal Times. Islam, Qur'an and Islamic reform A believing Muslim, Sardar is one of the strongest internal critics of Islam. He believes that the tendency to fall back comfortably on age-old interpretations is now dangerously obsolete. Islam's relationship and attitude to women, minorities, and notions of exclusivity and exclusive truth need to change fundamentally. In his work, Reformist Ideas and Muslim Intellectuals, Sardar states that: \\"Muslims have been on the verge of physical, cultural and intellectual extinction simply because they have allowed parochialism and traditionalism to rule their minds.\\" He adds: \\"We must break free from the ghetto mentality.\\"Ziauddin Sardar, ‚ÄòReformist Ideas and Muslim Intellectuals‚Äô in Abdullah Omar Naseef (Editor), Today's Problems, Tomorrow's Solutions: Future Thoughts on the Structure of Muslim Society, Mansell, London, 1988, p166. Sardar's most consistent output has been in the area of post-colonial Islamic reform, which is the subject of many of his books, including Islamic Futures: the Shape of Ideas to Come (Mansell, 1985) and The Future of Muslim Civilization (Mansell, 1987). Sardar believes that present-day Islamic societies have allowed creative thinking to fossilise. This is a situation which stands in contrast to Islamic history when scholars and scientists let their minds roam free and created an extraordinary renaissance in ideas, new knowledge and technology. In Islamic futures, Sardar enunciates several principles that need to be at the heart of all contemporary Islamic societies. These include: the need to recognise and promote plurality and diversity; the need to achieve progress through a consensus; and to engage constructively with the modern world. On the subject of Hadith and Qur'an, Sardar believes strongly that each generation must \\"reinterpret the textual sources in the light of its own experience\\", as happened throughout Islamic history and in each of the world's Islamic cultures. Sardar says that scripture needs to be seen as a product of its time and, therefore, must be periodically re- examined. If this process ceases to happen, sacred texts, according to Sardar, will lose their relevance to those who use and love them.Ziauddin Sardar, 'The Shariah as Problem-Solving Methodology' in Islam, Postmodernism and Other Futures: A Ziauddin Sardar Reader, edited by Sohail Inayatullah and Gail Boxwell, Pluto Press, London, 2003.Ziauddin Sardar, ‚ÄòRethinking Islam‚Äô in Islam, Postmodernism and Other Futures: A Ziauddin Sardar Reader, edited by Sohail Inayatullah and Gail Boxwell, Pluto Press, London, 2003. In his recent book, Reading the Qur‚Äôan, Sardar insists the interpretation of the Qur'an requires focus on four specific contexts. First, one needs to examine the context of the text itself and see what it is saying about the same subject in different places. Second, one needs to examine it in the context of the life of Prophet Muhammad and see what is happening to him, what is the event or the circumstances on which the Qur'an is commenting. Third, one must appreciate the verses of the Qur'an within the specific social, cultural, political and technological context of the Prophet's time ‚Äì they often address the Prophet and his followers, and it speaks to them in the historical context in which they lived. The Qur'an is a text revealed in history. Fourth, we can only interpret the Qur'an according to our own contemporary understanding so we also bring our own social and cultural context into play. The contextual analysis of the Qur'an, Sardar suggests, shows that not everything in the Sacred Text is universal ‚Äì many verses have significance for the time they were revealed. The universal message of the Qur'an can only be derived by examining its concepts and basic themes. The Qur'an, he argues, 'calls for rational, considered thought and interrogation not of appearances but of the deeper implications and meaning of how human beings think and act within and between all the diversity of our cultures, histories, languages and beliefs'.Ziauddin Sardar, Reading the Qur'an, Hurst & Co, London, 2011, p29 Science and empires As a child of parents who lived under the Raj as the colonial government was known in British India, much of Sardar's writings are about what happens to people, languages and institutions when one country is taken over by another country or empire. These ideas form the backbone to the second volume of his memors: Balti Britain (Granta, 2008). He has also written extensively on the relationship between knowledge and power, and on the development of scholarship that was designed to serve the needs of empire. Sardar argues that many advances in modern science and technology happened because of the needs of the military of European nation-states, or the many priorities of colonial authorities. In that sense he can be seen as a social- constructivist: someone who believes that the direction of science is dictated to a large extent by the social, political, cultural and financial priorities of societies and of those who fund science. During the 1980s, while working for Nature and New Scientist, Sardar wrote and lectured on how an Islamic science for the modern world might look like. In his book Explorations in Islamic Science, He described 'Islamic science' as: \\"a subjectively objective enterprise\\". By this, he meant that it can be both rationalist and traditionalist at the same time. Islamic science for Sardar would be shaped around an Islamic world view. It will be a science in which humans will see themselves as trustees of the Earth (khilafa) and they will act with justice (adl). What is lawful and what is prohibited (halal and haram) will be based, both on a consensus of the community (ijma) and public benefit (istislah). At the same time, Islamic science for Sardar is a universal science‚Äîgrounded in empiricism and rationality. It is an experimental science that can be duplicated and repeated by all, regardless of faith and culture. Its nature and contents will reflect the foundations, as well as the needs, requirements and concerns of those living in Muslim cultures. Many Muslims see science as a way of discovering absolute truths, or finding proof of the existence of God. For Sardar, it is a way of highlighting the complex and interconnected nature of reality, and hence a form of worship. But it is also an organised way of solving problems and fulfilling the needs of individuals and society.Ziauddin Sardar, Explorations in Islamic Science, Mansell, London, 1989. P163-164.Ziauddin Sardar, 'Waiting for Rain' New Scientist No 2321 15 December 2001. Futures Sardar was the editor of the journal Futures from 1999 to 2012 His editorship is noted for turning Futures into a prime journal in the field of futurology; and opening the journal to other disciplines and to encourage them to explore futures alternatives. His has explored what a viable future for Muslim civilisation will look like in his two studies, The Future of Muslim Civilisation and Islamic Futures: The Shape of Ideas to Come. In the former he argues that Muslim societies are obsessed with looking at their past and that the way forward is to reconstruct Muslim civilisation, intellectually and culturally, \\"brick by brick\\". Sardar suggests in this book what a Muslim future could look like. In the latter book, he offers a critique of ideas such as the notion of an \\"Islamic state\\" and \\"Islamic economics\\". Later, he went on to develop a new discipline: that of ‚ÄòIslamic futures‚Äô. This was based on five principles: 1: Islam must engage with the contemporary world not just as a religion, but as a way of shaping and understanding the world. Islam can provide a matrix and methodology for tackling problems and generating future choices and possibilities for Muslim societies. 2: Muslims must perceive themselves as being a civilisation, rather than members of a set of fragmented nation states. This is the only way to avoid stagnation and marginalisation. 3: Plurality and diversity must become the cornerstones of Islam. 4: Shaping viable and desirable futures for a Muslim civilisation must involve the active participation of communities and conscious effort at consultation (shura) at all levels of society with the aim of achieving a broad consensus (ijma). 5: To shape desirable alternative futures, Muslims must engage constructively with the contemporary world in all its dimensions.Ziauddin Sardar, 'What do we mean by Islamic Futures?‚Äô in Ibrahim M Abu-Rabi, editor, The Blackwell Companion to Contemporary Islamic Thought, Blackwell, Oxford, 2006, 562‚Äì586. Sardar also argues that the future has already been colonised to a very large extent. Forecasting, prediction and other methods of studying are often used by larger nations in their attempts to control smaller ones. Sardar says: \\"To keep the future open to all potentials, alternatives and dissenting possibilities, Sardar believes that it is necessary to envisage alternative futures from different civilisational and cultural perspectives.\\"Ziauddin Sardar,\\"‚ÄòThe problem of futures studies\\", in Ziauddin Sardar, editor, Rescuing All Our Futures: The Future of Futurology, Adamantine Press, London; Praeger Publishers, Westport, CT; 1998, pages 9‚Äì18 He has argued further that futurology itself is not a discipline with rigid boundaries, fixed theories, esoteric terminology and ‚Äògreat men‚Äô but an inter- and trans-disciplinary discourse that must emphasise open and pluralistic alternative futures. In a well cited paper, he presented Sardar's Four Laws of Futurology: Futurology are wicked (that is, they deal with complex, interconnected problems steeped in uncertainty and ignorance in a playway way); Futurology emphasise Mutually Assured Diversity (MAD), to ensure that diversity not only survives but thrives in any desirable future; Futurology are sceptical (of all popular futuristic projections and currents which are essentially attempts to colonize the future); and futurology are futureless ‚Äì ‚Äòsince we can have no true knowledge of the future, the impact of all futures explorations can only be meaningfully assessed in the present‚Äô and the true relevance of all futures exploration lies in the present. Identity and multiculturalism Sardar has written extensively on identity. He shares with the psychologist and philosopher from India, Ashis Nandy, the idea that humans do not have one but multiple identities. Identity, he argues, is not monolithic and static; but multiple and ever-changing. He has said: \\"Many categories of identity that we have conventionally projected on others ‚Äì such as the ‚Äòevil Orientals‚Äô, the ‚Äòinferior races of the colonies‚Äô, the immigrants, the Blacks, the refugees, the gypsies, the homosexuals ‚Äì are now an integral part of ourselves. It is not just that they are our neighbours but their ideas, concepts, lifestyles, food, clothes now play a central part in shaping ‚Äòus‚Äô and ‚Äòour society‚Äô. We thus have no yardstick to measure our difference and define ourselves.\\"http://www.jfs.tku.edu.tw/10.2.13.pdf In his book Orientalism and in Why Do People Hate America and American Dream, Global Nightmare, co-written with Merryl Wyn Davies, he explores how Muslims are perceived in books, films, television series and advertisements. He argues that the image of Muslims as \\"the darker side of Europe\\" seems to be a fixture of western consciousness and is recycled from generation to generation. In Aliens R Us, he says that Orientalist imagery has become an integral part of science fiction cinema. Sardar is a strong supporter of multiculturalism. He argues that multiculturalism is concerned about transforming power to non-western cultures and allowing these cultures to speak for themselves. In the first volume of his memoirs, Desperately Seeking Paradise, he explores different facets of Muslim identity. In Balti Britain, he explores what it means to be British and Asian in contemporary Britain. He has said: 'In Britain, we neglected to learn how we have been shaped by a long history of mutual entanglement and belonging. Without such learning we cannot give young British Asians the respect they deserve or appreciate the comfort so many have in living their compound identity, in being simultaneously British and Asian.Ziauddin Sardar, Balti Britain, Granta, London, 2009, p 290 Postmodernism and transmodernity Sardar is regarded by some as a 'postmodern' thinker. But he is at the same time a strong critic of what is called postmodernism. In his book Postmodernism and the Other, he describes postmodernism as \\"the new imperialism of Western culture\\". He argues that postmodernism is a continuation of colonialism and modernity and, as such, it further marginalises non-western cultures and tramples on their hopes and aspirations. He says: \\"By pretending to give voice to the marginalised, postmodernism in fact undermines the histories, tradition, morality, religions and worldviews ‚Äì everything that provides meaning and sense of direction to non-western cultures and societies. As such, postmodernism is a linear projection, a natural conclusion to modernity; and by privileging secularism it has become an arch ideology.\\" Sardar's alternative to postmodernism is what he calls \\"transmodernity\\". He describes this as: \\"the transfer of modernity and postmodernism from the edge of chaos to a new order of society\\". Transmodernity for Sardar is about finding a synthesis between \\"life enhancing tradition\\" ‚Äì tradition that is amenable to change and transition ‚Äì and a new form of modernity that respects the values and lifestyles of traditional cultures.Ziauddin Sardar, ‚ÄòBeyond Difference: Cultural Relations in a New Century‚Äô, in How Do You Know: Reading Ziauddin Sardar on Islam, Science and Cultural Relations edited by Ehsan Masood, Pluto Press, London, 2006.  Postnormal Times  Contemporary times, Sardar has argued recently, have become ‚Äòpostnormal‚Äô and that we live in \\"Postnormal Times\\" 'The espiritu del tiempo, the spirit of our age, is characterised by uncertainty, rapid change, realignment of power, upheaval and chaotic behaviour. We live in an in-between period where old orthodoxies are dying, new ones have yet to be born, and very few things seem to make sense. Ours is a transitional age, a time without the confidence that we can return to any past we have known and with no confidence in any path to a desirable, attainable or sustainable future. It is a time when all choices seem perilous, likely to lead to ruin, if not entirely over the edge of the abyss. In our time it is possible to dream all dreams of visionary futures but almost impossible to believe we have the capability or commitment to make any of them a reality. We live in a state of flux beset by indecision: what is for the best, which is worse? We are disempowered by the risks, cowed into timidity by fear of the choices we might be inclined or persuaded to contemplate‚Äô. He identifies three drivers of postnormal times: complexity, chaos and contradictions. The three ‚Äòc‚Äôs‚Äô, he argues, force us to rethink our ideas on progress, modernisation, efficiency and enhance the importance of social virtues, individual responsibility and ethics, and the role of imagination.Ziauddin Sardar, ‚ÄòWelcome to Postnormal Times‚Äô, Futures 42 (2010) 435‚Äì444 Postnormal times force us to focus on uncertainties, and the ignorances associated with them, that we will constantly encounter in the near and far future. Postnormal Times cannot be ‚Äòmanaged‚Äô or ‚Äòcontrolled‚Äô; the best we can hope for is to navigate our way through uncertainties and ignorances to avoid the edge of chaos. Sardar and his colleagues have suggested that the best way to navigate postnormal times is to see the future as three tomorrows: # # the ‚ÄòExtended Present‚Äô, with many empirically observed trends that are deeply embedded in the now and will manifest themselves in the coming years; # the Familiar Futures, which are mediated by images and imaginings of the future(s), from data-driven projections to science fiction; and # the Unthought Futures, which are not unthinkable but rather a horizon where something always remains unthought, which is to say that it is populated with seemingly infinite alternative futures. The three tomorrows impact the present both individually and simultaneously.

Cardiff first gained international recognition in the art world for her audio walks in 1995. She lives and work in British Columbia, Canada. Early life and education Janet Cardiff was born in 1957 in Brussels, Ontario, Canada, and grew up on a farm outside of a small village. In 1980, she earned her BFA from Queens University, Kingston, Ontario. In 1983 she earned an MVA from the University of Alberta, Edmonton, Alberta, Canada. While studying at Edmonton, she met George Bures Miller who would become her husband and collaborator. Cardiff's training is in photography and printmaking and her early works were large-scale silkscreens. Her first artistic collaboration with Bures Miller, in 1983, was a Super-8 film called The Guardian Angel. After this filmmaking experience, Cardiff's work began to include elements of narrative sequencing, experiments with sound, and movement. Solo works Her first major work based in recorded sound was called The Whispering Room, a minimal work consisting of a dark space with 16 small round speakers mounted on stands that play the voice of individual characters. As visitors move through the space and the voices, a film projector is triggered playing a slightly slow-motion film. Some of Cardiff's most well known solo works are her audio walks. Her first was created somewhat serendipitously during a residency at the Banff Centre in 1991. In 1996, she was asked to create a site-specific piece for the museum grounds at Louisiana Museum in Denmark. Since then, she has created notable walks such as Her Long Black Hair (2004), in and around Central Park, and Words Drawn in Water (2005) for the Hirshhorn Museum. Cardiff has been included in exhibitions such as: Present Tense, Nine Artists in the Nineties, San Francisco Museum of Modern Art, NowHere, Louisiana Museum, Denmark, The Museum as Muse, Museum of Modern Art, the Carnegie International '99/00, the Tate Modern Opening Exhibition as well as a project commissioned by Artangel in London. This project (\\"The Missing Voice (Case Study B)\\") was commissioned in 1999 and continues to run. It is an audio tour that leaves from the Whitechapel Library, next to the Whitechapel tube stop and snakes its way through London's East End, weaving fictional narrative with descriptions about the actual landscape. Cardiff represented Canada at the S√£o Paulo Art Biennial in 1998, and at the 6th Istanbul Biennial in 1999 with her partner George Bures Miller. cc-by-sa-3.0 In her Forty Part Motet she placed 40 speakers in 8 groups, each speaker playing a recording of one voice singing Thomas Tallis' Spem in alium, enabling the audience to walk through the space and \\"sample\\" individual voices of the polyphonic vocal music. This work is now part of the permanent collection of the National Gallery of Canada in Ottawa, Ontario, Canada., the Museum of Modern Art in New York City, and of Inhotim in Brumadinho, Brazil. This work was presented at The Cloisters, September to December 2013, that museum's first presentation of contemporary art. The work was installed in the Fuentidue√±a Chapel, which features the late twelfth- century apse from the church of San Mart√≠n at Fuentidue√±a, near Segovia, Spain, providing a transformed acoustic experience. A recent mid-career retrospective, Janet Cardiff: A Survey of Works, Including Collaborations with George Bures Miller, opened at P.S. 1 Contemporary Art Center, Long Island City, Queens, in 2001 and has travelled to Montr√©al, Oslo, and Turin. Exhibitions in 2006 include Good Vibrations‚ÄìLe arti visive e il Rock, Palazzo delle Papesse, Centro Arte Contemporanea, Siena; Anticipation, The Museum of Contemporary Photography, Chicago; and Sonic Presence, Bergen Kunsthall, Bergen, Norway. In Real Time (1999) was the very first video walk that Cardiff created. It took place in the library of the Carnegie Museum of Art and begins with the participant donning a pair of headphones attached to a small video camera. Upon playback Cardiff says to watch the screen and follow along with what we see and hear for approximately 18 minutes. This piece relies on the discrepancies between what is seen on the video monitor and what is actually occurring in the library. Work with George Bures Miller \\"The Dark Pool\\" was the first multimedia installation collaboration Cardiff and Miller created and showed in 1995 in Vancouver. The work consists of a dimly lit room, furnished with cardboard, carpets, and collected ephemera and artifacts, through which visitors move, triggering sounds such as musical segments, portions of conversations, and bits of stories. Cardiff and Miller consider the work very personal and, despite offers, have not sold it. Cardiff and Bures Miller represented Canada at the 49th Venice Biennale with Paradise Institute (2001), a 16-seat movie theatre where viewers watched a film, becoming entangled as witnesses to a possible crime played out in the real world audience and on the screen. The artists won La Biennale di Venezia Special Award at Venice, presented to Canadian artists for the first time and the Benesse Prize, recognizing artists who break new artistic ground with an experimental and pioneering spirit. Cardiff and Bures Miller have recently had exhibitions at Fraenkel Gallery, San Francisco (2018), the Art Gallery of Alberta (2010), Fruitmarket Gallery, Edinburgh, Scotland (2008) the Miami Art Museum (2007) Vancouver Art Gallery (2005), Luhring Augustine, New York (2004), Contemporary Arts Center, Cincinnati (2003), Art Gallery of Ontario (2002), National Gallery of Canada (2002) and Oakville Galleries, Oakville, Ontario (2000). In 2012, she took part along with her husband in the Kassel‚Äôs Documenta. They proposed two installations: the first one is an audio installation in the forest called ¬´Forest (for a thousand years‚Ä¶)¬ª of 28 minutes audio loop. The second one is a 26-minute video walk specially produced for Documenta and called ¬´Alter Bahnhof video walk¬ª.

An approximate chronology of his career can be established. Two inscriptions found in Ostia attest to Calpurnianus present in that city as pontifex Volcani in the years 194 and 195. A fragmentary inscription from Rome attests that after serving as praetor he officially served as juridicus in Britain when he had to replace an unnamed consular, then after his election to the quindecimviri sacris faciundis the sortition awarded him the office of proconsular governor of Macedonia. Birley notes that most experts date Calpurnianus' tenure as acting governor to about 200 \\"on the death or sudden disappearance of Virius Lupus.\\"Anthony R. Birley, The Fasti of Roman Britain, (Oxford: Clarendon Press, 1981), p. 137 However, there is no firm basis to presume he was elected to the quindecimviri in 204, nor that the two offices of juridicus and proconsul fell close to that year; the duty of acting governor may have fallen on his shoulders when a governor of the province was killed in battle in the far north of the province.Birley, Fasti of Roman Britain, pp. 137f Birley lists two or three other incidents around 185 when the legions in Britain attempted to make different legionary commanders emperor. \\"Further evidence will be needed before this dating of Calpurnianus' acting governorship can be regarded as definite,\\" Birley concludesBirley, Fasti of Roman Britain, pp. 138f Little more is known of Calpurnianus. Birley speculates that he \\"preferred to devote himself to his private or local concerns, for example at Ostia, which was presumably his home.\\"Birley, Fasti of Roman Britain, p. 139 Birley also notes the existence of Marcus Antius Gratillianus, quaestor of Sicily in 213, and suggests Gratillianus could be Calpurnianus' son.Birley, Fasti of Roman Britain, p. 140 See also * Antia (gens)  References  Antius Crescens Calpurnianus, Marcus Category:Suffect consuls of Imperial Rome Category:Roman governors of Macedonia Category:3rd- century deaths Category:3rd-century Romans Category:Year of birth unknown ","title":"Marcus Antius Crescens Calpurnianus"},{"id":"1245993","text":"Michael Kelley (October 27, 1954 ‚Äì January 31, 2012) was an American artist. His work involved found objects, textile banners, drawings, assemblage, collage, performance and video. He often worked collaboratively and had produced projects with artists Paul McCarthy, Tony Oursler, and John Miller. Writing in The New York Times, in 2012, Holland Cotter described the artist as \\"one of the most influential American artists of the past quarter century and a pungent commentator on American class, popular culture and youthful rebellion.\\" Early life Kelley was born in Wayne, Michigan, a suburb of Detroit, to a working class Roman Catholic family in October 1954.Holland Cotter, \\"Mike Kelley, an Artist with Attitude, Dies at 57,\\" The New York Times, Feb 1, 2012, accessed April 22, 2012. His father was in charge of maintenance for a public school system; his mother was a cook in the executive dining room at Ford Motor Company. In his early years he was involved with the city's music scene, which spawned bands such as Iggy and the Stooges, and was a member of the noise band Destroy All Monsters. In 1976, Kelley graduated from the University of Michigan and then moved to Los Angeles. In 1978 he graduated from the California Institute of the Arts with a Master of Fine Arts, where he admired the work of his teachers John Baldessari, Laurie Anderson, David Askevold and Douglas Huebler. Work During his time at CalArts, Kelley started to work on a series of projects in which he explored works with loose poetic themes, such as The Sublime, Monkey Island and Plato's Cave, Rothko's Chapel, Lincoln's Profile, using a variety of different media such as drawing, painting, sculpture, performance, video, and writing. In the 1980s he became known for working with another type of material: crocheted blankets, fabric dolls and other rag toys found at thrift stores and yard sales. Perhaps the most famous work in this vein, More Love Hours Than Can Ever Be Repaid and The Wages of Sin from 1987, featured a mess of used rag dolls, animals and blankets strewn across a canvas, a way of investing a fictional childhood scene with some visceral pathos which was first shown at Rosamund Felsen Gallery in Los Angeles. In 1988, Kelley created an installation called Pay for Your Pleasure, which featured a gallery of portraits of men of genius ‚Äî poets, philosophers and artists included ‚Äî subverted at the end by a painting created by a convicted criminal.Jori Finkel (February 2, 2012), Mike Kelley dies at 57; L.A. contemporary artist Los Angeles Times. In From My Institution to Yours (1988) and Proposal for the Decoration of an Island of Conference Rooms (1992), Kelly appropriated photocopied drawings and other ephemera of vernacular office humor and moved it into more formalized environments where such crude materials are normally not seen.\\"Mike Kelley, Three Projects: Half a Man, From My Institution to Yours, and Pay for Your Pleasure\\" , Renaissance Society, May 1988.Doug Harvey, \\"Don't Look Back: Mike Kelley's Proposal\\", LA Weekly, December 11, 2003. Kelley often employed soft, tangled toys as a satirical metaphor for Expressionist art. In Deodorized Central Mass with Satellites (1991‚Äì99), an installation sculpture made from untidy clusters of toys suspended from the ceiling, a dozen monochrome plush-toy spheres, linked by a system of cables and pulleys across the ceiling, orbit around a central, rainbow-colored blob; ten large, geometrically faceted, brightly colored wall-reliefs are actually monumental dispensers of pine-scented air freshener, which automatically send their cleansing spray into the room at timed intervals.Christopher Knight (November 8, 2012), Review: A Mike Kelley sculpture makes its West Coast debut Los Angeles Times. In 1995, he produced Educational Complex, an architectural model of the institutions in which he had studied, including his Catholic elementary school and the University of Michigan in Ann Arbor.Mike Kelley MoMA. According to the Whitney Museum of American Art, the work's selective inclusion of institutional locations and features responds to \\"the rising infatuation of the public with issues of repressed memory syndrome and child abuse... The implication is that anything that can't be remembered is somehow the result of trauma.\\" In 1999, he made a short video in which Superman recites selections from Sylvia Plath's The Bell Jar.Adrian Searle (September 7, 2011), Mike Kelley: It came from Planet Bunkum The Guardian. Kelley was in the band Poetics with fellow California Institute of the Arts students John Miller and Tony Oursler.. In 1997‚Äì98, Kelley and Oursler presented the Poetics Project at Documenta X, as well as at venues in Los Angeles, New York, and Tokyo; through video projections, sound, and artworks, this installation re- created their experience at CalArts as members of a short-lived band.Mike Kelley Guggenheim Collection. Along with his collaborations with Shaw and Oursler, Kelley was also known for working with artist Paul McCarthy in the 1990s. They collaborated on a series of video projects, including a 1992 work based on Johanna Spyri's classic children's book, \\"Heidi\\". A 1986 Massachusetts Institute of Technology presentation of Kelley's performance Plato's Cave, Rothko's Chapel, Lincoln's Profile (1985) included a live performance by Sonic Youth; the band later featured his orange-knit creatures on the cover and booklet of their 1992 record Dirty.\\"DIRTY\\".

Kandor's depiction in these narratives is inconsistent and fragmentary, prompting Kelley to create multiple versions of it, cast in colorful resins and illuminated like reliquaries. Kandor 4 (2007) includes a giant bell jar and an air compressor pump. The installation Kandor-Con 2000 was first presented in the millennium show at Kunstmuseum Bonn and later at the Technical University Berlin (2007), the Deichtorhallen/Sammlung Falckenberg, Hamburg (2007); ZKM, Karlsruhe (2008); the Shanghai Biennial (2008); and the Centre Pompidou, Paris (2010). Kandor-Con 2000 is conceived ‚Äì and continued to develop ‚Äì as a work in progress. Throughout the exhibitions, architecture students built cardboard models of Kandor inspired by the original comics. These models were sent to Pasadena, where Kelley made scaled down casts.Mike Kelley: 1954 - 2012, A Tribute Exhibition Including Works from the Kandor Project, July 28 ‚Äì September 16, 2012 Watermill Center, Water Mill, New York.

Kandor 12, constructed in off-white resin and evocative of a group of chess pawns, or minarets, is encased in a shadowy brown bottle, which sits on a platform resembling a Greek column positioned in front of a chest of drawers and an illuminated translucent green wall. In 2009 Kelley collaborated with longtime friend and fellow artist Michael Smith on \\"A Voyage of Growth and Discovery\\", a six-channel video and sculptural installation piece.

The artist's last performance video was Vice Anglais from 2011. Kelley's work was inspired by diverse sources such as philosophy, politics, history, underground music, decorative arts and working-class artistic expression. His art often examined class and gender issues as well as issues of normality, criminality and perversion. Kelley lived and worked in various places in Los Angeles, among them the Farley Building in Eagle Rock.\\"A Voyage of Growth and Discovery\\", May 26, 2010 ‚Äì August 26, 2010 West of Rome, Los Angeles.

Death On January 31, 2012, Kelley was found dead from an apparent suicide at his home in South Pasadena, California.The New York TimesWall Street Journal March 14, 2013 There is some thought that he did so from depression. A spontaneous memorial to Kelley was built in an abandoned carport near his studio in the Highland Park section of L.A. shortly after news of his death. Mourners were invited via an anonymous Facebook page to \\"help rebuild MORE LOVE HOURS THAN CAN EVER BE REPAID AND THE WAGES OF SIN (1987), by contributing stuffed fabric toys, afghans, dried corn, wax candles‚Ä¶building an altar of unabashed sentimentality.\\" The memorial was active throughout February 2012 and was dismantled in early March 2012, with the contents given to the Mike Kelley Foundation. Exhibitions Kelley began having regular one-man exhibitions at Metro Pictures Gallery in Manhattan in 1982, and at Rosamund Felsen Gallery in Los Angeles the following year. He subsequently started to gain recognition outside Los Angeles in the mid-eighties with the sculptural objects and installations from the series Half-a-Man. In 2005, he had his first solo show at Gagosian Gallery in New York City, which was representing him at his death. A retrospective, \\"Mike Kelley: Catholic Tastes,\\" appeared at the Whitney Museum of American Art in 1993 and traveled to Los Angeles and Munich; a second retrospective appeared at the Museum of Contemporary Art in Barcelona in 1997; and a third was at the Tate Liverpool in 2004.

While Brenham is Blinn's main campus, with dorms and apartments, more than 65 percent of its students attend the Bryan campus. History Blinn was established as Mission Institute in 1884 by the Southern German Conference of the Methodist denomination. It became coeducational in 1888 when it began admitting women. In 1889, the institute's name was changed to Blinn Memorial College in honor of the Reverend Christian Blinn of New York, who had donated a considerable sum of money to make the school possible. In 1927, the Board of Trustees, under leadership of President Philip Deschner, organized a junior college. In 1930, Blinn merged with Southwestern University of Georgetown, Texas. In 1934, a new charter was procured by the citizens of Brenham, and a private nonsectarian junior college was organized as Blinn College with nine regents as the board of control. In February 1937, all connections with Southwestern University and the Methodist denominations were severed. On June 8, 1937, voters in Washington County levied a property tax for the creation of a public junior college district. Blinn thus became the first county-owned junior college district in Texas. The college continues to operate as one of the largest of some fifty public community college districts in Texas. After some early struggles (including the campus nearly closing in 1946 due to fiscal issues), the college began to grow and do well under the leadership of Dr. Thomas Morris Spencer, one of the early public junior college pioneers in Texas. When he left the college in 1957 it was on a firm fiscal footing. The Bryan campus was established in 1970, and by the early 1980s, a third campus opened in College Station. In 1997, the Villa Maria Road campus opened consolidating the programs that were located in the Townshire Shopping Center in Bryan and the Woodstone Center in College Station. The third Brazos County site, located in the former Bryan post office, continues to house the dental hygiene, radiologic technology, and workforce education programs. The original three buildings on the Bryan campuses were expanded to six, and in 2002, the former Schulman Theater was purchased and converted to classroom space, known as the College Park Campus (CPC). The Schulenburg campus opened in 1997 and Sealy in 2005. Texas A&M; University is constructing a Riverside Campus adjacent to Texas State Highways 47 and 21. It is known as the RELLIS Campus, meaning \\"Respect\\", \\"Excellence\\", \\"Leadership\\", \\"Loyalty\\", \\"Integrity\\", and \\"Selfless service\\". Blinn College will maintain a presence at RELLIS to partner with other institutions and organizations. Blinn had planned to establish a new campus off Sandy Point Road and Farm to Market 2818. By joining the RELLIS campus instead, Blinn expects to save from $10 to $12 million. In addition to construction, Blinn officials project a $5.7 million cost for furnishings for the campus. The total projected cost to Blinn will exceed $34 million. Vaughn Construction will spearhead the project. On March 31, 2017, groundbreaking was held for the Blinn College educational building being established at RELLIS. Blinn chief executive officer Mary Hensley at the dedication ceremony said: \\"Today we celebrate a historic, unprecedented partnership that paves a new path for the future of higher education. The RELLIS campus denotes that collaboration and a commitment to student achievement.\\" , David Sommer, the president of the Blinn trustees, added that the partnership with TAMU could \\"set the standard for university and community college collaboration.\\" Blinn College offers academic transfer courses and these technical programs: Associate Degree and Vocational Nursing, Surgical Technology, EMS, Physical Therapy Assisting, Dental Hygiene, Radiologic Technology, Fire Science, Criminal Justice, Early Childhood Development, Legal Assisting, Real Estate, Computer Information Technology, Information Management, and Business (General Business, Accounting, Business Administration and Management, Hospitality Management, Small Business Management). The college also offers noncredit, non-transferable workforce education programs. Academic transfer Blinn boasts the highest transfer rate in the state of Texas, sending students to institutions such as Texas A&M; University, Sam Houston State University, Texas State University, the University of Texas and the University of Houston. Its transfer rate to four- year universities is 49% compared to the state average of 27%. Blinn transfers more students to Texas A&M; University than any other two-year college. Blinn technical students score among the best in the state on board and licensure exams. Blinn and Texas A&M; University established the first co-enrollment program of its kind with the TEAM (Transfer Enrollment at Texas A&M;) Program. In 2013, the program was awarded the Texas Higher Education Coordinating Board's Recognition of Excellence, and in 2014 it received the THECB Star Award. Community impact Blinn College Sealy campus A 2014 study found that Blinn made a $345.3 million impact in its service area, including $239.5 million in added income by former students employed in the regional workforce, $61.3 million in College operations spending and $44.5 million in student spending. The report found that Blinn has made an impact of $247.4 million in Bryan-College Station, $83 million in Brenham, $11.1 million in Schulenburg and $3.9 million in Sealy. Blinn has also been recognized for its community service. In 2011, Blinn received the Carnegie Foundation for the Advancement of Teaching Community Engagement Classification, and in 2012 it was the only community college in the state of Texas to be named to the President's Higher Education Community Service Honor Roll. Each year, Blinn devotes a day to community service, called the Blinn Blitz, and hundreds of students participate in local community service projects. Athletics The home campus in Brenham has offered intercollegiate athletics since 1903 and has won 30 national championships since 1987. The Blinn Buccaneers play football, men's and women's basketball, baseball, softball and volleyball. The football program won NJCAA championships in 1995, 1996, 2006, and 2009, the last of which was won with Cam Newton. The volleyball team won the NJCAA championship in 2008, 2011, 2013 and 2014. The softball team consistently makes the national tournament. Blinn's award-winning cheer and dance teams won the UCA and UDA National Championships in 2014 and 2015.

Sagittal keels differ from sagittal crests, which are found in some earlier hominins (notably the genus Paranthropus) and in a range of other mammals. While a proper crest functions in anchoring the muscles of mastication to the cranium, the keel is lower and rounded in cross-section, and the jaw muscles do not attach to it. Sagittal keels occur in several early human species, most noticeably in Homo erectus, occasionally in Homo heidelbergensis and in some Upper Paleolithic Homo sapiens specimens. Most modern Homo sapiens groups have lost them, likely as part of the general trend toward thinning of the cranial bones to make room for larger brains during the Pleistocene. However, there is a small portion of modern humans who have the feature, but its function and etiology are unknown. Patrick Stewart of Star Trek: The Next Generation and the martial artist Shi Yan Ming present good examples of modern humans (Homo sapiens sapiens) with this feature. The keel appears to be tied to general cranial robustness and is more common in adult men than women and absent in children.

Since going on the air in 1979, it has been owned and operated by the University of Tennessee at Chattanooga and broadcasts from Cadek Hall on the UTC campus. The station is a member of National Public Radio, Public Radio International, and American Public Media, and broadcasts a variety of modern music, including alternative, rock and related genres. WUTC has a broadcast radius of approximately 100+ miles over four states (Tennessee, North Carolina, Georgia, and Alabama), except to the west, being limited by Monteagle Mountain. WUTC began streaming its broadcast online in July 2002. In May 2006, WUTC became the first Chattanooga radio station (public or commercial) to simulcast its broadcast in HD Radio format. Until 1988, WUTC rebroadcast the morning programming of WUOT-FM in Knoxville; afterward, WUTC obtained its own satellite downlink and was able to obtain nationally syndicated programming on its own. In October 1995, WUTC became the exclusive home in the Chattanooga market for several NPR programs, including Morning Edition, All Things Considered, Car Talk and Weekend Edition, when the nearby WSMC-FM dropped them due to conflicts with religious programming on its schedule . WUTC-FM maintains a mix of syndicated programming and local music shows in its weekday schedule, with a focus on syndicated shows almost exclusively on weekends. In March 2017, The University of Tennessee- Chattanooga fired WUTC reporter Jacqui Hulbert, who interviewed state politicians about the transgender bathroom bill, after they suggested they did not know she was a journalist even though she was reportedly wearing headphones and a microphone with the WUTC logo. The dismissal came after state legislators complained to university officials. Station and university officials said that Hulbert breached journalistic ethics by not identifying herself as a journalist or giving the legislators a chance to comment before the story aired. However, critics claimed station and university officials overreacted out of fear that the legislature would reduce their funding.

After his tenure as governor in Lower Germany, he was appointed governor of Roman Britain. An inscription at Bainbridge fort records new barracks being built under his governorship, possibly in connection with recent uprisings by the Brigantes, and attests his presence there in 205.

There appears to have been a position as chancellor of the university already in its earliest period. According to the papal bull of Sixtus IV from 1477, the Archbishop of Uppsala, Jakob Ulfsson (the initiator of the university), was to be chancellor of the university. His successors appear not to have held this position, and during the 16th century and its long periods of dormancy of the university, no chancellor seems to have been appointed. According to the privileges for Uppsala University promulgated by the regent Duke Charles (later king Charles IX) in 1595, the archbishop of Uppsala, the other bishops of the realm and the university were to elect the chancellor, who was then to be confirmed in his position by the king. In 1604 the university requested Prince Gustavus Adolphus as chancellor but received the reply that the Duke was still too young to understand these matters. In 1607 Count Abraham Brahe was appointed chancellor, but does not seem to have given much attention to the university, in contrast to the king's former tutor, the learned Johan Skytte, still remembered (among other things) for his donation of the Skyttean professorship, who was appointed chancellor in 1622 and can be said to begin the continuous chronological list of chancellors. Skytte was a member of the council of state (riksr√•det) and the king ordered in 1625 that one of the councillors of state (riksr√•d) was always to hold the position of chancellor. The position of Pro-Chancellor (prokansler), deputy of the Chancellor, was always held ex officio by the Archbishop of Uppsala. Charles XV) and his brother Prince Gustaf, known as a song composer (the two young men closest to the pulpit), attending a lecture held by Law Professor Johan Christopher Lindblad (1799-1876) in the Theatrum ≈íconomicum, Uppsala. (Lithograph from 1846.) From the latter half of the 18th century until 1859 the position of chancellor was more often than not held by members of the royal family. For instance, Crown Prince Carl Johan, the former French Marshal Jean Baptiste Bernadotte and later king Charles XIV of Sweden, held the position from his election as heir to the throne and adoption by king Charles XIII. On his accession to the throne in 1818, his French-born son, Crown Prince Oscar (later Oscar I of Sweden), succeeded his father in the position, as did his son, Crown Prince Carl, when Oscar became king in 1844. Carl (the later Charles XV of Sweden) belonged to the first Swedish-born generation of the Bernadotte dynasty, and he and his brothers were also the first members of any Swedish royal dynasty to attend university since Charles X, who had been matriculated in Uppsala somewhat over 200 years earlier (1638). Carl was in fact chancellor already while he was himself a student at the university, and he remained so until his accession to the throne in 1859. From 1861 the Chancellor of Uppsala University was also head of the Karolinska Institute (founded in 1810), and from 1859 until 1893 the Chancellorship of Uppsala University was always held by the same person as the Chancellorship of Lund University; from June 17, 1893, the positions were combined into a single one, with the new University Chancellor having responsibility both for the two old universities and for the then recently founded University Colleges of Stockholm and Gothenburg (now the Universities of Stockholm and Gothenburg). The role of the chancellor and his level of interference in university affairs depended on the aspirations or visions of the person holding the position and varied over time. With the new national university chancellor getting a supervisory role in relation to higher education as a whole from 1893, the local leadership role of the rector magnificus grew from the end of the 19th century and the terms of the rectors of the university lengthened from the one or two semesters at a time which had previously been the rule to several years or even a decade or two. The position of Pro-Chancellor was abolished in 1934, but the last incumbent, Archbishop Erling Eidem retained it until his retirement in 1950.

Team Oregon also agreed to only market its materials in Oregon, as in the past, and will still deny that the agreed upon acknowledgment of copyright is needed. Team Oregon claimed victory in the settlement, in that no payments were required and they may continue to use the training materials, while the MSF said the settlement was the same as one they had offered in 2006. Underlying the dispute was the question of whether programs like Team Oregon, or Idaho's Skills Training Advantage for Riders (STAR), were free to develop their own training programs, specifically in response to the contention by the state programs that the MSF had made changes in their course that weakened it, making it easier to pass while putting riders at greater risk. Idaho's training manager had expected to be named in the suit along with Team Oregon, due to their similarity to Team Oregon.

Temple was born in Lexington, North Carolina. He batted and threw right-handed. Temple was a career .284 hitter with 22 home runs and 395 RBI in 1420 games. A legitimate leadoff hitter and four-time All-Star, he was a very popular player in Cincinnati in the 1950s. Throughout his career, he walked more often than he struck out, compiling an outstanding 1.92 walk-to-strikeout ratio (648-to-338) and a .363 on-base percentage. Temple also had above- average speed and good instincts on the base paths. Quietly, he had 140 steals in 198 attempts (71%).

Gabriel Alomar (; 1873‚Äì1941) was a poet, essayist, educator and diplomat of the early twentieth century in Spain, closely related to the Catalan art movement Modernisme. He was an active leftist libertarian, chiefly in Barcelona and the other Catalan-speaking regions, from the first years of the 20th century until his death from pneumonia in exile. Beginnings Alomar was born in Palma and raised in the Balearic Islands, a traditional province of Spain where the power of the Catholic Church was very strong. His father was a minor bureaucrat and so was moved around rather often; this made Gabriel's childhood rather more cosmopolitan than was normal for Spanish youngsters of the time. In 1888, after finishing secondary school in Palma, he (like many young Majorcan men) went to mainland Barcelona to finish his education. In this environment, he became active as a journalist as well as continuing to publish poetry in what the critic Josephine de Boer has called a Parnassian mode, as well as becoming involved with the Catalan regionalist movement and the literary trend of noucentisme. Poetry Gabriel Alomar is often placed by critics among the poets of the Escola Mallorquina, but this choice is problematic. Alomar's poetry is technically rather conservative in form, but in terms of content it does not fit well with the highly orthodox Catholic beliefs of the other poets associated with the school (Antoni Alcover, Costa i Llobera). A better-fitting classification is to group his poetry with the Parnassianist strain of Modernista poetry. While Alomar's verse was and is well regarded in his home territory of Majorca, it is his essays and journalism which continue to be reprinted and read. Journalism Alomar's periodical writings tended less toward strict reportage and more toward a polemic style couched in column form. His columns often read like speeches; in fact, as an educator and secondary school director, many of them began as lectures. The most famous of these speech-articles, El futurisme, describes Alomar's vision of Spain's present condition, its problems, and his ideas for solving them. He is credited of inventing the term futurism, as well as partly its ideology, not the Italian poet Filippo Tommaso Marinetti, this discovery being outlined by authors with the stature of Nicaraguan modernist poet Rub√©n Dar√≠o and Chilean avant-garde poet Vicente Huidobro.Haro, Pedro Aull√≥n de, ‚ÄúLa poes√≠a en el siglo XX (hasta 1939)‚Äù, Taurus, Madrid, 1989, pp. 114-115.Huidobro, Vicente, ‚ÄúPasando y pasando‚Äù, Santiago de Chile, Imprenta Chile, 1914, pp. 161-173Dar√≠o, Rub√©n, ‚ÄúMarinetti y el futurismo‚Äù, In: ‚ÄúLa Naci√≥n‚Äù, Buenos Aires, 5 de abril de 1909, as cited in: Osorio, Nelson, ‚ÄúManifiestos, proclamas y pol√©micas de la vanguardia literaria hispanoamericana‚Äù, Biblioteca Ayacucho, Caracas, 1988, pp. 3-7Lentzen, Manfred, ‚ÄúMarinetti y el futurismo en Espa√±a‚Äù, In: ‚ÄúActas del IX Congreso de la Asociaci√≥n Internacional de Hispanistas 18-23 agosto 1986‚Äù, II, Berlin, Frankfurt am Main, Vervuert, 1989, pp. 309-318. In essence, Alomar believed that Spain was addicted to its own past, that it preferred to maintain a belief in the regeneration of Iberia's imperial past rather than turn about and face the twentieth century. For Alomar, the future was far more important than the past, and so this addiction was Spain's main problem. Thus the name. Diplomat Gabriel Alomar was the Spanish Ambassador to Italy (1932‚Äì34) and Egypt from 1937 to the end of the Spanish Civil War but remained in Egypt until his death in Cairo in 1941. Influence Gabriel Alomar had many occupations in his life, but throughout it he was constantly in demand as a writer of prologues. He wrote dozens, in Castilian Spanish, Catalan, and French, for editions of famous writers and for young authors needing a boost.

Aerial view (1967) Geography The Church The river Wyna flows north at first and heads northwest thereafter. The valley has an average width of about . On both sides of the valley there are steep hills with tributary valleys and small high plateaus. The landscape is not dissimilar to that of the Tafeljura, even though - geographically and geologically speaking - Gr√§nichen lies in the Midland of Switzerland. The hills on the left side of the valley are (from north to south): Manzenberg ( ), W√§llenen (559 m), Moosberg (550 m), Heidberg () and Pfendel (). These are foothills of the Schornig (), which marks the transition to the valley of the river Suhre. The hills on the right side of the valley are called Fuden (), R√§ckholderen (), Breitenberg () and Surberg (). In front of the Breitenberg is the Schulthess () which has almost the shape of an ellipsis. The Dossen () und the high plateau of the Liebegg are foothills of the Surberg. Near the southern border, at an average distance of two kilometers, there are three hamlets, which also belong to the municipality of Gr√§nichen: R√ºtihof () on Moorbergs, Bleien () and Refental () between Breitenberg, Dossen and Surberg. Gr√§nichen has an area, , of . Of this area, 30.1% is used for agricultural purposes, while 56.7% is forested. Of the rest of the land, 13.1% is settled (buildings or roads) and the remainder (0.1%) is non-productive (rivers or lakes). The highest point is at above main sea level on the 'Pfendel', the lowest point is at where the river wyna leaves the village. The seven neighbouring villages are Suhr in the nordwest, Hunzenschwil in the north, Schafisheim in the northeast, Seon in the east, Teufenthal in the south, Unterkulm in the south, Muhen in the southwest and Hirschthal in the west. History History's first mention of Gr√§nichen was around 1184 under the name of Cranechon. However, archaeological discoveries dating from the Neolithic, as well as the remains of a Celtic castle, show that the area around Gr√§nichen has been settled for quite some time. In the 12th century Gr√§nichen belonged to the monastery of Engelberg and later came under the reign of the Habsburgs, who passed the government of the village to the Lords of the Castle of Liebegg. After 1415, Gr√§nichen belonged to Bern. The construction of the Wynentalbahn railway in 1904 promoted the settlement of local industries. Coat of arms The blazon of the municipal coat of arms is Per bend sinister Or and Azure a Bend counterchanged.Flags of the World.com accessed 24-January-2010 Points of interest The castle of Liebegg resides on a hill close to the border to Teufenthal, about three kilometers south-south-east of the village center. The Castle, which dates from the 11th century, is nowadays used as a center for culture, meetings and congresses. Near the village center one finds the \\"Chornhaus\\", which, built in 1695, looks very similar to a small castle, because of its tower. Until 1798 it served as a granary and was thereafter used by the municipal administration department for over a century. Since the new parish hall was completed in 1995 it contains a small village museum. The Reformed Church was built from 1661 to 1663 on the site where the previous church had collapsed.

He restored many of the installations at Hadrian's Wall following the uprisings of earlier years and a Victory dedication mentions his name. Dio Cassius also writes of victories in Britain in 206 and it is therefore likely that he finished the re-occupation of the province and its frontiers. Troubles from the tribes immediately north of the wall however, trouble from the Maeatae and the Caledonian Confederacy appear to have required expeditions north of the wall. Senecio seems to have been initially successful; he erected a victory monument at Benwell.. Herodian records that he requested re-enforcements from emperor Septimius Severus, perhaps to undertake punishment raids in Scotland or for a military expedition led by the emperor himself. His report back to Rome described barbarians rebelling, \\"overrunning the land, taking booty and causing destruction\\". Despite being 62 years old, Septimius Severus chose to intervene personally, arriving in 208 to lead new campaigns. When Severus arrived in Britain he charged his youngest son, Publius Septimius Geta with the task of administering some aspects of Roman Britain although as viceroy rather than as a formal y . When Severus died at York in 211, his eldest son, Caracalla tried to claim the throne. As part of his efforts to settle matters in Britain before leaving to press his claim, he may have divided the province into Britannia Inferior in the north and Britannia Superior in the south, each with its own governor. Alternatively, the division may have been decreed by Severus sometime previously.

It earned him critical acclaim and was considered a \\"protest novel\\", in the tradition of Richard Wright.Michael P. Jeffries, \\"The Rage in Harlem, and Beyond\\", review of Lawrence P. Jackson's Chester B. Himes: A Biography, New York Times Book Review, 27 August 2017 The book was adapted as a 1968 film, starring Raymond St. Jacques, Dana Wynter, Kevin McCarthy, Barbara McNair, and Arthur O'Connell. The screenplay differed markedly from the novel. Plot and characters The story spans four days in the life of Robert \\"Bob\\" Jones, a newcomer to Los Angeles from Ohio. With some college education, he works as a crew leader in a naval shipyard. In this period, black workers are gaining opportunities in the defense industry as a result of executive orders of President Franklin D. Roosevelt during World War II. However, Jones cannot escape the pressures of racism. He believes he was promoted as a supervisor only to gain the cooperation of black workers in the war effort. He is forced to deal with anti-communist paranoia, resentment from whites on the floor working at the same jobs as \\"colored boys\\", and the baiting of black workers by some white females. His fears invade his dreams, aspirations, and passions. His dream of making something of himself in California is jeopardized as he reacts to the actions of the white people around him. He struggles to contain his urges to fight, kill, and rape as ways to overcome his resentment of white power arrayed against him. The main characters are the protagonist, Bob Jones, and two women: Madge Perkins, who is white; and Alice Harrison, his higher-class African-American girlfriend. Bob struggles for place in a white-dominated world and is filled with violent thoughts against white people, but does not act on them. In what is described as a \\"sexually charged novel\\", Madge makes a racial slur toward Bob. His calling her a \\"bitch\\" results in his demotion. He considers raping her as a way to get back at white America, seeing her as a symbol of \\"whiteness\\", but when she expresses sexual attraction to him, he rejects her. Alice tells Bob it is no use getting angry about the inequality that blacks must live with, and he has to learn to deal with it. Themes Themes addressed in the novel include racism suffered by blacks, color differentiation among African Americans (Alice's light skin is associated with her higher class), employment discrimination against blacks, and class divisions among whites and blacks. Communism is featured generously, as the Communist unionists (\\"agitators\\") are the only ones who talk about the issue of race in any way with which the protagonist agrees. There is some reference to jazz. The novel is referred to in Frantz Fanon's book, Black Skin White Masks (1952), first published in French, in the chapter titled \\"The Fact of Blackness\\".David Macey, Frantz Fanon: A Biography, Verso, 2012, p. 191.

Description The black head and neck with white \\"chinstrap\\" distinguish this goose from all other geese except the larger Canada goose (Branta canadensis) and the similarly sized barnacle goose (B. leucopsis). There are up to 5 subspecies of cackling goose, of varying sizes and plumage details. The female looks virtually identical but is slightly lighter and has a different voice. Some are hard to distinguish from the Canada goose, with which the cackling goose was long assumed to form one species, the cackling goose and the smaller Canada goose subspecies being called the lesser Canada goose. The smallest Cackling geese (B. h. minima) are much smaller than any Canada goose, but the subspecies B. h. hutchinsii, at up to , grows to the same size as some Canada geese. The distinctness of the extinct population of the Komandorski and Kuril Islands B. h. asiatica is controversial. The barnacle goose differs in having a black breast and grey, rather than brownish, body plumage. Measurements: * Length: 24.8-25.6 in (63-65 cm) * Weight: 49.3-84.0 oz (1398-2380 g) * Wingspan: 42.5-43.7 in (108-111 cm) B. h. minima on eggs Range This species is native to North America. It breeds in northern Canada and Alaska in a variety of tundra habitats. However, the nest is usually located in an elevated area near water. The eggs are laid in a shallow depression lined with plant material and down. Males can be very aggressive in defending territory. A pair may mate for life (up to around 20 years). Adult geese are often seen leading their goslings in a line with one parent at the front, and the other at the back of the \\"parade\\". Like most geese, it is naturally migratory, the wintering range being most of the U.S., and locally in western Canada and northern Mexico. The calls overhead from large groups of cackling geese flying in V-shaped formation signal the transitions into spring and fall. In some areas, migration routes have changed due to changes in habitat and food sources. Cackling geese have occasionally reached western Europe naturally, as has been proved by ringing recoveries. The birds are of at least the subspecies hutchinsii, and possibly others. Cackling geese are also found naturally on occasions in the Kamchatka Peninsula in eastern Siberia, eastern China, and throughout Japan. Feeding These birds feed mainly on plant material. When feeding in water, they submerge their heads and necks to reach aquatic plants, sometimes tipping forward like a dabbling duck. Flocks of these birds often feed on leftover cultivated grains in fields, especially during migration or in winter. They also eat some insects, molluscs and crustaceans. Status By the early 20th century, over-hunting and loss of habitat in the late 19th and early 20th centuries had resulted in a serious decline in the numbers of this bird in its native range. With improved game laws and habitat restoration and preservation programs, their populations have recovered in most of their range, although some local populations may still be declining, especially of the subspecies minima and leucopareia. Though the taxonomic distinctness of the Komandorski and Kuril Islands populations, which used to winter in Japan, is controversial, it is without doubt that they disappeared around 1929. B. h. minima family Systematics The genus name Branta is a Latinised form of Old Norse Brandg√°s, \\"burnt (black) goose\\", and the specific epithet hutchinsii commemorates English surgeon Thomas Hutchins who was employed by the Hudson's Bay Company. The cackling goose was originally considered to be the same species or a subspecies of the Canada goose, but in July 2004 the American Ornithologists' Union's (AOU) Committee on Classification and Nomenclature split the two into two species, making cackling goose into a full species with the scientific name Branta hutchinsii. The British Ornithologists' Union (BOU) followed suit in June 2005. The AOU has divided the many associated subspecies between both animals. To the present species were assigned: *Richardson's cackling goose (B. h. hutchinsii) *Aleutian cackling goose (B. h. leucopareia) *Small cackling goose (B. h. minima) *Taverner's cackling goose (B. h. taverneri) *‚Ä†Bering cackling goose (B. h. asiatica)‚Äîdoubtfully distinct from B. h. leucopareia; extinct (c.1929) The distinctions between the two geese have led to a great deal of confusion and debate among ornithologists. This has been aggravated by the overlap between the small types of Canada goose and larger types of cackling goose. The old \\"lesser Canada geese\\" were believed to be a partly hybrid population, with the birds named taverneri considered a mixture of minima with subspecies occidentalis and parvipes, which today remain with the Canada goose proper. Actually however, taverneri is one of the larger subspecies of cackling geese. In addition, it has been determined that the barnacle goose (B. leucopsis) is a derivative of the cackling goose lineage, whereas the Hawaiian goose (B. sandvicensis) is an insular representative of the Canada goose. In the wake of the discussion generated by the official standalone species designation, introduced by the AOU and BOU in 2004 and 2005, Harold C. Hanson published a paper in 2007 suggesting that Canada and cackling geese should be split into six species and 200 subspecies. The radical nature of this proposal provoked surprise, with Richard Banks of the AOU urging caution before any of Hanson's proposals be accepted.Banks, Richard (2007) Review of Harold Hanson's \\"The White-Cheeked Geese: Branta Canadensis, B.

To negotiate a turn successfully, the combined center of mass of the rider and the single-track vehicle must first be leaned in the direction of the turn, and steering briefly in the opposite direction causes that lean. The rider's action of countersteering is sometimes referred to as \\"giving a steering command\\". The scientific literature does not provide a clear and comprehensive definition of countersteering. In fact, \\"a proper distinction between steer torque and steer angle ... is not always made.\\" A hypothetical curve on dry asphalt How it works Image montage showing different stages of countersteering. Here, a scooter is countersteered to turn left. When countersteering to turn left, the following is performed: * A torque on the handlebars to the right is applied. * The front wheel will then rotate about the steering axis to the right and the tire will generate forces in the contact patch to the right. * The machine as a whole steers to the right * Because the forces in the contact patch are at ground level, this pulls the wheels \\"out from under\\" the bike to the right and causes it to lean to the left. * The rider, or in most cases the inherent stability of the bike, provides the steering torque necessary to rotate the front wheel back to the left and in the direction of the desired turn. * The bike begins a turn to the left. While this appears to be a complex sequence of motions, it is performed by every child who rides a bicycle. The entire sequence goes largely unnoticed by most riders, which is why some assert that they do not do it. It is also important to distinguish the steering torque necessary to initiate the lean required for a given turn from the sustained steering torque and steering angle necessary to maintain a constant radius and lean angle until it is time to exit the turn. * The initial steer torque and angle are both opposite the desired turn direction. * The sustained steer angle is in the same direction as the turn. * The sustained steer torque required to maintain that steer angle is either with or opposite the turnV. Cossalter pp. 1343‚Äì1356: \\"Correlations with the subjective opinions of expert test riders have shown that a low torque effort should be applied to the handlebar in order to have a good feeling, and preferably in a sense opposite to the turning direction.\\" direction depending on forward speed, bike geometry, and combined bike and rider mass distribution. =Need to lean to turn= A bike can negotiate a curve only when the combined center of mass of bike and rider leans toward the inside of the turn at an angle appropriate for the velocity and the radius of the turn: :\\\\theta = \\\\arctan \\\\left (\\\\frac{v^2}{gr}\\\\right ) where v is the forward speed, r is the radius of the turn and g is the acceleration of gravity. Higher speeds and tighter turns require greater lean angles. If the mass is not first leaned into the turn, the inertia of the rider and bike will cause them to continue in a straight line as the tires track out from under them along the curve. The transition of riding in a straight line to negotiating a turn is a process of leaning the bike into the turn, and the most practical way to cause that lean (of the combined center of mass of bike and rider) is to move the support points in the opposite direction first. =Stable lean= stable range (in this case 6 m/s), to a positive steer torque (to the right) that begins as an impulse and then remains constant. It causes an initial steer angle to the right, a lean to the left, and eventually a steady-state lean to the left, steer angle to the left, and thus a turn to the left. As the desired angle is approached, the front wheel must usually be steered into the turn to maintain that angle or the bike will continue to lean with gravity, increasing in rate, until the side contacts the ground. This process often requires little or no physical effort, because the geometry of the steering system of most bikes is designed in such a way that the front wheel has a strong tendency to steer in the direction of a lean. The actual torque the rider must apply to the handlebars to maintain a steady-state turn is a complex function of bike geometry, mass distribution, rider position, tire properties, turn radius, and forward speed. At low speeds, the steering torque necessary from the rider is usually negative, that is opposite the direction of the turn, even when the steering angle is in the direction of the turn. At higher speeds, the direction of the necessary input torque often becomes positive, that is in the same direction as the turn.V. Cossalter pp. 241‚Äì342 =At low speeds= At low speeds countersteering is equally necessary, but the countersteering is then so subtle that it is hidden by the continuous corrections that are made in balancing the bike, often falling below a just noticeable difference or threshold of perception of the rider. Countersteering at low speed may be further concealed by the ensuing much larger steering angle possible in the direction of the turn. =Gyroscopic effects= One effect of turning the front wheel is a roll moment caused by gyroscopic precession. The magnitude of this moment is proportional to the moment of inertia of the front wheel, its spin rate (forward motion), the rate that the rider turns the front wheel by applying a torque to the handlebars, and the cosine of the angle between the steering axis and the vertical. For a sample motorcycle moving at 22 m/s (50 mph) that has a front wheel with a moment of inertia of 0.6 kgm2, turning the front wheel one degree in half a second generates a roll moment of 3.5 Nm. In comparison, the lateral force on the front tire as it tracks out from under the motorcycle reaches a maximum of 50 N. This, acting on the 0.6 m (2 ft) height of the center of mass, generates a roll moment of 30 Nm. While the moment from gyroscopic forces is only 12% of this, it can play a significant part because it begins to act as soon as the rider applies the torque, instead of building up more slowly as the wheel out- tracks. This can be especially helpful in motorcycle racing. Motorcycles Deliberately countersteering is essential for safe motorcycle riding, and as a result is generally a part of safe riding courses run by organisations like the Motorcycle Safety Foundation, the Canada Safety Council, or Australian Q-Ride providers. Deliberately countersteering a motorcycle is a much more efficient way to steer than to just lean. At higher speeds the self-balancing property of the bike gets stiffer, and a given input force applied to the handlebars produces smaller changes in lean angle. =Training= Much of the art of motorcycle cornering is learning how to effectively push the grips into corners and how to maintain proper lean angles through the turn. When the need for a quick swerve to one side suddenly arises in an emergency, it is essential to know, through prior practice, that countersteering is the most efficient way to change the motorcycle's course. Many accidents result when otherwise experienced riders who have never carefully developed this skill encounter an unexpected obstacle. To encourage an understanding of the phenomena around countersteering, the phrase positive steering is sometimes used. Other phrases are \\"PRESS ‚Äì To turn, the motorcycle must lean\\", \\"To lean the motorcycle, press on the handgrip in the direction of the turn\\" or \\"Press left ‚Äì lean left ‚Äì go left\\". The Motorcycle Safety Foundation teaches countersteering to all students in all of its schools, as do all motorcycle racing schools. Countersteering is included in United States state motorcycle operator manuals and tests, such as Washington, New Jersey, California, and Missouri. =Safety= According to the Hurt Report, most motorcycle riders in the United States would over-brake and skid the rear wheel and under-brake the front when trying hard to avoid a collision. The ability to countersteer and swerve was essentially absent with many motorcycle operators. The often small amount of initial countersteering input required to get the bike to lean, which may be as little as 0.125 seconds, keeps many riders unaware of the concept.National Public Services Research Institute, \\"Photographic Analysis of Motorcycle Operator Control Responses\\", 1976 Multi-track vehicles Sidecar on Vespa scooter Tripendo recumbent tricycle, a tilting three-wheeler Three wheeled motorcycles without the ability to lean have no need to be countersteered, and an initial steer torque in one direction does not automatically result in a turn in the other direction. This includes sidecar rigs where the car is rigidly mounted on the bike. The three wheeled BRP Can- Am Spyder Roadster uses two front wheels which do not lean, and so it steers like a car. Some sidecars allow the motorcycle to lean independent of the sidecar, and in some cases, the sidecar even leans in parallel with the motorcycle. These vehicles must be countersteered the same way as a solo motorcycle. The three wheel Piaggio MP3 uses mechanical linkages to lean the two front wheels in parallel with the rear frame, and so that it is countersteered in the same manner as a two-wheeled motorcycle. Free-leaning multi-track vehicles must be balanced by countersteering before turning. Multi-track leaning vehicles that are forced-tilted, such as the Carver, are tilted without countersteering the control and are not balanced by the operator. Later versions of the Carver introduced automatic countersteer to increase tilt speed and reduce the force required to tilt the vehicle. Other forced-tilted vehicles may incorporate automatic countersteering. A prototype tilting multi-track free leaning vehicle was developed in 1984 that employs automatic countersteering and does not require any balancing skills. Countersteering by weight shifting With a sufficiently light bike (especially a bicycle), the rider can initiate a lean and turn without using the handlebars by shifting body weight, called counter lean by some authors.Evangelou, S, 2004 \\"The Control and Stability Analysis of Two-Wheeled Road Vehicles\\", PhD Thesis, Imperial College London Documented physical experimentation shows that on heavy bikes (many motorcycles) shifting body weight is less effective at initiating leans. The following is done when countersteering using weight shifting to turn left: * The rider applies a momentary torque, either at the seat via the legs or in the torso that causes the bike itself to lean to the right. * The combined center of mass of the bike and rider is only lowered and not moved out, but if the front of the bike is free to swivel about its steering axis, the lean to the right will cause it to steer to the right by some combination of gyroscopic precession, ground reaction forces, gravitational force on an off-axis center of mass or simply the inertia of an off-axis center of mass depending on the exact geometry and mass distribution of the particular bike and the amount of torque and the speed at which it is applied. * This countersteering to the right causes the ground contact to move to the right of the center of mass, as the bike moves forward, thus generating a leftward lean. Finally the front end steers to the left and the bike enters the left turn. The amount of leftward steering necessary to balance the leftward lean appropriate for the forward speed and radius of the turn is controlled by the torque generated by the rider, again either at the seat or in the torso. To straighten back out of the turn, the rider simply reverses the procedure for entering it: cause the bike to lean farther to the left; this causes it to steer farther to the left, which moves the wheel contact patches farther to the left, eventually reducing the leftward lean and exiting the turn. A National Highway Traffic Safety Administration study showed that rider lean has a larger influence on a lighter motorcycle than a heavier one, which helps explain why no-hands steering is less effective on heavy motorcycles. Leaning the torso with respect to the bike does not cause the bike to lean far enough to generate anything but the shallowest turns. No-hands riders may be able to keep a heavy bike centered in a lane and negotiate shallow highway turns, but not much else. Complex maneuvers are not possible using weightshifting alone because even for a light machine there is insufficient control authority. Although on a sufficiently light bike (especially a bicycle), the rider can initiate a lean and turn by shifting body weight, there is no evidence that complex maneuvers can be performed by bodyweight alone. Other uses Motorcycle speedway racing The term countersteering is also used by some authors to refer to the need on bikes to steer in the opposite direction of the turn (negative steering angle) to maintain control in response to significant rear wheel slippage. Motorcycle speedway racing takes place on an oval track with a loose surface of dirt, cinders or shale. Riders slide their machines sideways, powersliding or broadsiding into the turns, using an extreme form of this type of countersteering that is maintained throughout the turn. This also works, without power, for bicycles on loose or slippery surfaces, although it is an advanced technique. The term is also used in the discussion of the automobile driving technique called drifting.

Famous initially for discovering the world's largest iron ore deposit in 1952 and becoming one of the richest men in Australia, he is now perhaps best remembered for his marriage to the much-younger Rose Porteous, a Filipino woman and his former maid. Hancock's daughter, Gina Rinehart, was bitterly opposed to Hancock's relationship with Porteous. The conflicts between Rinehart and Porteous overshadowed his final years and continued until more than a decade after his death. Aside from his extensively publicised personal life, Hancock's extreme right-wing views on the government of Australia, Indigenous Australians, and sociopolitical topics caused widespread controversy during his life. Early life Hancock was born on 10 June 1909 in Leederville, Perth, Western Australia. He was the oldest of four children born to Lilian () and George Hancock; his mother was born in South Australia and his father in Western Australia. His father's great-aunt was Emma Withnell, while a cousin was Sir Valston Hancock.Melville J. Davies, 'Hancock, Langley Frederick (Lang) (1909‚Äì1992)', Australian Dictionary of Biography, National Centre of Biography, Australian National University, http://adb.anu.edu.au/biography/hancock-langley-frederick- lang-17492/text29181, published online 2016, accessed online 15 August 2018. Hancock spent his early childhood on his family's station at Ashburton Downs, later moving to Mulga Downs Station in the north-west after his father, George Hancock, bought a farming estate there. After initially being educated at home, at the age of eight he began boarding at the St Aloysius Convent of Mercy in Toodyay. He later attended Hale School in Perth from 1924 to 1927, where he played for the school cricket and football teams. Upon completing his secondary education, he returned to Mulga Downs Station to help his father manage the property. As a young man, Hancock was widely considered charming and charismatic. In 1935 he married 21-year-old Susette Maley, described by his biographer Debi Marshall as \\"an attractive blonde with laughing eyes\\". The couple lived at Mulga Downs for many years, but Maley pined for city life and eventually left Hancock to return to Perth. Their separation ‚Äì formalised in 1944 ‚Äì was amicable. Also in 1935, Hancock took over the management of Mulga Downs station from his father. He partnered with his old schoolmate E. A. \\"Peter\\" Wright in running the property, later boasting that no deals between the two men were ever sealed with anything stronger than a handshake. During the Second World War, Hancock served in a militia unit, the 11th (North-West) Battalion, Volunteer Defence Corps, and obtained the rank of sergeant. On 4 August 1947, he married his second wife, Hope Margaret Nicholas, the mother of his only acknowledged child, Gina Rinehart. Lang and Hope remained married for 35 years, until her death in 1983 at the age of 66. In 2012 Hilda Kickett, who had long claimed to be Lang Hancock's illegitimate daughter came forward to claim that the late mining magnate had had an illicit affair with an Aboriginal cook on his property at Mulga Downs resulting in her conception. These claims have not been corroborated. Wittenoom Gorge As a child, Hancock showed a keen interest in mining and prospecting and discovered asbestos at Wittenoom Gorge at the age of ten. He staked a claim at Wittenoom in 1934 and began mining blue asbestos there in 1938 with the company Australian Blue Asbestos. The mine attracted the attention of national behemoths CSR Limited, who purchased the claim in 1943. Hancock retained a 49% share after the sale, but appears to have become quickly disillusioned about this arrangement, complaining that CSR viewed their 51% share as a licence to ignore his views. He sold the remainder of his claim in 1948. The mine would later become the source of much controversy, when hundreds of cases of asbestos-related diseases came to light. He was aware of the dangers of asbestos prior to selling his stake in Australian Blue Asbestos (as recently discovered papers have shown) but never accepted any liability, nor have his companies since his death. Neither the Australian federal government nor the Western Australian state government have pursued his companies for damages as of 2017. The Pilbara discovery Hancock struck iron ore in the Pilbara region, in north-west WA On 16 November 1952, Hancock claimed he discovered the world's largest deposit of iron ore in the Pilbara region of Western Australia. Hancock said he was flying from Nunyerry to Perth with his wife, Hope, when they were forced by bad weather to fly low, through the gorges of the Turner River. In Hancock's own words, The story is widely accepted in modern descriptions of the discovery, but one biographer, Neill Phillipson, disputes Hancock's account. In Man of Iron he argues that there was no rain in the area of the Turner River on 16 November 1952 or indeed on any day in November 1952, a fact the Australian Bureau of Metrology confirms. Hancock returned to the area many times and, accompanied by prospector Ken McCamey, followed the iron ore over a distance of 112 km. He soon came to realise that he had stumbled across reserves of iron ore so vast that they could supply the entire world, thus confirming the discovery of the geologist Harry Page Woodward, who after his survey asserted: At the time, however, the common perception was that mineral resources were scarce in Australia. The Commonwealth Government had enacted an embargo on the export of iron ore, while the Government of Western Australia banned the pegging of claims for iron ore prospects. Hancock lobbied furiously for a decade to get the ban lifted and in 1961 was finally able to reveal his discovery and stake his claim. In the mid sixties Hancock turned once more to Peter Wright and the pair entered into a deal with mining giant Rio Tinto Group to develop the iron ore find. Hancock named it \\"Hope Downs\\" after his wife. Under the terms of the deal Rio Tinto set up and still administer a mine in the area. Wright and Hancock walked away with annual royalties of A$25 million, split evenly between the two men. In 1990, Hancock was estimated by Business Review Weekly to be worth a minimum of A$125 million. Political activity Although Lang Hancock never aspired to political office, he held strong conservative political views and often entered the political arena. In addition to his activities in the 1950s, lobbying against government restrictions on the mining of iron ore, Hancock donated considerable sums of money to politicians of many political stripes. His political views aligned most closely with the Liberal and National Parties of Australia. He was a good friend and strong supporter of Queensland Premier Joh Bjelke-Petersen and donated A$632,000 to the Queensland National Party while Sir Joh was in charge. He gave A$314,000 to their counterparts in Western Australia, but also gave the Western Australian Labor Party A$985,000; because \\"at least they can't do any harm\\". Hancock had had a falling-out with Sir Charles Court and the Western Australian Liberals and was adamant that the Liberals should be kept out of power as long as possible. Hancock also offered strong advice to the politicians he favoured. In 1977 he sent a Telex to the then-Treasurer of Australia Sir Phillip Lynch, telling him he needed to \\"stop money coming in to finance subversive activities, such as Friends of the Earth, which is a well- heeled foreign operation.\\" He also suggested to Sir Joh Bjelke-Petersen that the Federal Government should attempt to censor the works of Ralph Nader and John Kenneth Galbraith, lest they \\"wreck Fraser's government\\". In 1969 Hancock and his partner Peter Wright commenced publication in Perth of a weekly newspaper, The Sunday Independent, principally to help further their mining interests. Faced with strong competition, the newspaper is thought never to have turned a profit, Hancock largely relinquishing his interest in it in the early 70s and Wright selling it to The Truth in 1984. Hancock was a staunch proponent of small government and resented what he considered to be interference by the Commonwealth Government in Western Australian affairs. He declared before a state Royal Commission in 1991 that \\"I have always believed that the best government is the least government\\", and that \\"Although governments do not and cannot positively help business, they can be disruptive and destructive.\\" Hancock bankrolled an unsuccessful secessionist party in the 1970s, and in 1979 published a book, Wake Up Australia, outlining what he saw as the case for Western Australian secession. The book was launched by Gina Rinehart and Sir Joh Bjelke-Petersen. Attitudes towards Aboriginal people Hancock is quoted as saying, :\\"Mining in Australia occupies less than one- fifth of one percent of the total surface of our continent and yet it supports 14 million people. Nothing should be sacred from mining whether it's your ground, my ground, the blackfellow's ground or anybody else's. So the question of Aboriginal land rights and things of this nature shouldn‚Äôt exist.\\" In a 1984 television interview,Couldn‚Äôt Be Fairer (1984) Hancock suggested forcing unemployed indigenous Australians ‚àí specifically \\"the ones that are no good to themselves and who can't accept things, the half-castes\\" ‚àí to collect their welfare cheques from a central location. \\"And when they had gravitated there, I would dope the water up so that they were sterile and would breed themselves out in the future, and that would solve the problem.\\" Rose Porteous In 1983, the same year as Hope Hancock's death, Rose Lacson (now Porteous) arrived in Australia from the Philippines on a three-month working visa. By the arrangement of Hancock's daughter, Gina Rinehart, Porteous began working as a maid for the newly widowed Lang Hancock. Hancock and Porteous became romantically involved over the course of Porteous' employment and they were wed on 6 July 1985 in Sydney. It was a third marriage for each of them. Porteous, who was thirty-nine years younger than her husband, was often accused of gold digging because of their age disparity, as well as being unfaithful and promiscuous. As Porteous later stated: \\"I have been accused of sleeping with every man in Australia ... I would have been a very busy woman.\\" Hancock's daughter, Gina Rinehart, who stood to inherit his entire estate, did not attend the wedding. Prix d'Amour, during its demolition in early 2006. Although the marriage would later prove tumultuous, early on Hancock was clearly infatuated with his young wife. He gave her money and investments in real estate in the Sydney area. Porteous, in turn, helped Hancock to look and act like a much younger man, belying his eight decades. As The Age put it, \\"Rose made Lang feel younger, sprucing up his wardrobe, dying his hair and getting rid of his cane.\\" Together they built the \\"Prix d'Amour\\", a lavish 16-block mansion overlooking the Swan River. The mansion, which was modelled after Tara, the plantation mansion from the movie Gone with the Wind, was the setting for many large parties at which Hancock and Porteous would \\"dance into the night\\". As the marriage wore on, however, the relationship between Lang and Rose began to break down. Rinehart would later claim that Hancock's bride had paid little attention to his worsening health, but had instead \\"screeched at him for money\\". Although there were many quarrels, the Hancocks remained married until Lang's death in 1992. On 25 June 1992, less than three months after Hancock's death, Porteous married for the fourth time, to Hancock's long-time friend William Porteous. Rinehart was indignant at the haste with which her stepmother had remarried. The Prix d'Amour, built in 1990, was bulldozed in March 2006. West Australian finance minister Max Evans mourned the loss of the home as the excavators moved in and recalled Hancock had been bemused by his wife's desire for the sprawling mansion: \\"He'd say, 'Mr Evans, I don't know why Rose wants this house, I'd be happy sleeping in a transportable.' \\" Mrs Porteous told him she'd always wanted to live in Prix D'Amour, \\"but I don't want to clean it\\", she had added quickly. Death and inquest In March 1992 Hancock died, aged 82 years, while living in the guesthouse of the Prix D'Amour, the palatial home he had built for his third wife, Rose. According to his daughter, the death was \\"unexpected\\" and came \\"despite strong will to live\\". An autopsy showed that he had died of arteriosclerotic heart disease and police investigation revealed no evidence to contradict that. However, Hancock's daughter insisted that her stepmother had unnaturally hastened his death. Two successive state coroners refused to allow an inquest, but one was eventually granted in 1999 under the direction of the WA Attorney-General, Peter Foss. After preliminary hearings during 2000, the inquest began in April 2001 with an initial estimate of 63 witnesses to be called over five weeks. The inquest was dominated by claims that Porteous had literally nagged Hancock to death with shrill tantrums and arguments. Porteous denied the allegations, famously explaining: \\"For anyone else it would be a tantrum, for me it's just raising my voice.\\" In the last few days of Hancock's life, Porteous had attempted to pressure him into changing his will and Hancock eventually took out a restraining order against her. The inquest was put on hold after allegations that Rinehart had paid witnesses to appear and that some had lied in their testimony. It resumed three months later with a smaller witness list and ended with the finding that Hancock had died of natural causes and not as a result of Porteous' behaviour. With a legal bill of A$2.7m, Rose and William Porteous commenced action against Rinehart, that was eventually settled out of court in 2003. Legacy Hancock's daughter, Gina Rinehart, continues to chair Hancock Prospecting and its expansion into mining projects continues in Western Australia and other states of Australia, estimated to be earning about A$870 million in revenue in 2011. Rinehart is Australia's richest person and was also the world's richest woman for a period of time, with a net worth of 29.17 billion during 2012; by 2019, her wealth had eased to around $US14.8 billion, according to Forbes. The Hancock Range, situated about north-west of the town of Newman at , commemorates the family's contribution to the establishment of the pastoral and mining industry in the Pilbara region.

Lower Pannonia, was a province of the Roman Empire. Its capital was Sirmium. It was one of the border provinces on the Danube. It was formed in the year 103 AD by Emperor Trajan who divided the former province of Pannonia into two parts: Pannonia Superior and Pannonia Inferior. The province included parts of present-day states of Hungary, Serbia, Croatia, and Bosnia and Herzegovina. The province was bordered to the east (across the Danube) by a Sarmatian tribe‚Äîthe Iazyges. Later, the Vandals appeared to the north-east. Settlements Pannonia Inferior Major settlements in Pannonia Inferior included: * Sirmium (Sremska Mitrovica) which several times served as an imperial residence for several emperors. * Aquincum (Buda), the provincial capital. * Cuccium (Ilok) * Cibalae (Vinkovci) * Mursa (Osijek) * Certissa (ƒêakovo) * Marsonia (Slavonski Brod) * Sopianae (P√©cs) Aftermath and legacy The province was yet again split during the reign of the tetrarchs into two more provinces, Pannonia Valeria in the north, with the new provincial capital at Sopianae, and Pannonia Secunda in the south with Sirmium as the provincial capital. During the Frankish period, in the 9th century, the term Lower Pannonia was used to designate eastern and southern regions of Pannonia, including the Slavic Principality of Lower Pannonia.

In an effort to reduce this shortfall, at the end of 2016 the board lowered their expected annual rate of return on investments from 7.5% to 7.0%, increasing the costs California cities must pay toward their workers' pensions.

Vision. Heart. The CalPERS story. Chantilly, VA: History Factory, 2007. . In 1932, the \\"State Employees' Retirement System\\" (SERS) began operation.Pichardo, Raquel. CalPERS a model of innovation at 75. Pensions & Investments, May 14, 2007. Retrieved October 30, 2008. The California State Employees Association, established in 1931, began a close relationship with SERS that continues to this day. In 1939, the state Legislature passed a bill that allowed local public agencies (such as cities, counties, and school districts) to participate in SERS. Initially, SERS could invest only in bonds, but in 1953 a new state law allowed SERS to invest in real estate. SERS then built a , 16-story building in Sacramento which opened in 1965; part of the building housed SERS employees, and part of the building was leased to other state agencies. The \\"first major new benefit for SERS members,\\" health insurance, began in 1962 with the passage of a law that was later amended to become the \\"Public Employees' Medical and Hospital Care Act\\". Because by 1967 SERS was contracting with 585 local public agencies for retirement benefits, its name was changed to the \\"Public Employees' Retirement System\\" (PERS). With the passage of a ballot proposition and a state law in 1966‚Äì1967, PERS was allowed to invest 25% of its portfolio in stocks; in 1984, Proposition 21 removed the 25% limitation. State Treasurer Jesse M. Unruh was a PERS Board member in the mid-1980s. He began PERS' emphasis on corporate governance; in addition, he was instrumental in creating the Council of Institutional Investors, an organization of pension funds and other institutions that opposed \\"greenmail and other corporate practices that benefited only management\\". In 1986, the headquarters building of PERS, now called \\"Lincoln Plaza North\\", was completed in Sacramento at a cost of $81 million.CalPERS. Lincoln Plaza North building. May 2, 2007. Retrieved November 3, 2008. The building, which has , is known for its six-story-high atrium and landscaped terraces. =Governor Pete Wilson= In 1990, fund value reached $49.8 billion. In July 1991, Governor Pete Wilson addressed the state's $14.3 billion budget deficit by removing $1.6 billion from the pension fund. Wilson further sought to give the governor's office control of the PERS‚Äô actuarial projections and the appointment of a majority of its board of directors. Public employee unions responded by seeking an amendment to the Constitution of California that would guarantee the board's independence, remove the fund's duty to minimize contributions or administrative costs, and require the provision of benefits to ‚Äútake precedence over any other duty.‚Äù The initiative, known as Proposition 162, passed by a single percent at the November California elections, 1992. Proposition 162, also known as the \\"California Pension Protection Act of 1992,\\" gave the PERS board \\"the sole and exclusive fiduciary responsibility over the assets of\\" PERS.Proposition #162. People's Advocate. Retrieved December 24, 2008. To avoid confusion with public employees' retirement systems in other states, the organization's name was changed to \\"CalPERS\\" in 1992. By 1996, the CalPERS portfolio was worth $100 billion, and the number of members exceeded 1 million. =Governor Gray Davis= In 1999, fund value reached $159.1 billion, requiring $159 million in state tax dollar contributions. In 1999, the CalPERS board proposed a benefits expansion that would allow public employees to retire at age 55 and collect more than half their highest salary for life. CalPERS predicted the benefits would require no increase in the State's contributions by projecting an average annual return of 8.25% over the next decade. When Board member Phil Angelides‚Äô aide questioned whether the stock market could grow that long, Board Chairman William Crist, a former union president, replied that they ‚Äúcould make all sorts of different assumptions and make predictions, but that‚Äôs really more than I think we can expect our staff to do.‚Äù CalPERS' chief actuary, objected, finding that it would be ‚Äúfairly catastrophic‚Äù if the fund only grew at 4.4%. The benefits expansion bill, SB 400, passed with unanimous backing by California State Assembly Democrats and was signed into law by Governor Gray Davis. CalPERS then produced a video promoting the legislation with Chairman Crist promising greater benefits ‚Äúwithout imposing any additional cost on the taxpayers‚Äù and the California State Employees Association president praising it as ‚Äúthe biggest thing since sliced bread‚Äù. The next year the dot-com bubble burst, and CalPERS did not grow, instead losing value in the stock market downturn of 2002. In 2001‚Äì2002, CalPERS provided technical assistance for the Sarbanes-Oxley Act because it had sustained financial losses from the Enron and WorldCom bankruptcies. After the Great Recession, in 2009 CalPERS investments lost 24%, dropping $67 billion in value. Chairman Crist retired from the board and it was later revealed he had accepted more than $800,000 from a firm to ensure hundreds of millions of investment from CalPERS.

Retrieved November 6, 2008. =Governor Jerry Brown= In 2012, Governor Jerry Brown signed legislation that reduced benefits for all new state employees and sought to combat pension spiking. Legislators rejected Governor Brown's proposals to include a 401(k) type defined contribution plan and to require CalPERS Board members to be independent, not themselves pensioners. Governor Brown promoted the reform as the ‚Äúbiggest rollback to public pension benefits in the history of California‚Äù, but it only resulted in a 1% to 5% reduction in contribution increases. Total savings from the reform are estimated to be $28 to $38 billion. In the fall of 2014, CalPERS named Ted Eliopoulos as chief investment officer. He won the #2 ranking in the Public Investor 100 for 2016. Blackstone Group LP announced in November 2015 that it would acquire 43 international and domestic real estate funds from CalPERS for $3 billion. In 2016, CalPERS fund value reached $295.1 billion. State tax dollar contributions have had to increase to $45 billion, a 3,000% increase from before the 1999 benefits expansion. Promised benefits exceeded funds available by $241.3 billion. Unfunded retiree healthcare costs add an additional $125 billion to California's public retirement debt.

Investment Income has fluctuated in the last 15 years, 1999‚Äì2013, with five years of losses and 10 years of gains. There were investment income gains of $17 billion in 1999, $16 billion in 2000 and $5 billion in 2003. The stock market declines in 2001 led to investment income losses of 12 billion in 2001 and 10 billion in 2002. Thus, the five-year period 1999 to 2003 period had a cumulative income of $16 billion, or about three billion a year on an investment portfolio of over $200 billion.CalPERS.

This four-year period had a cumulative investment income of $108 billion, or $27 billion a year. With the stock market decline in 2008, during the financial crisis of 2007‚Äì2008, there were large investment income losses. There was a 12 billion dollar investment income loss in 2008 and 55 billion in 2009. The 124 billion dollars of income in the nine-year period 1999-2007 was reduced by half as a consequence of the combined losses of 67 billion in 2008 and 2009. This totals to 57 billion dollars of investment income during this 11-year period, or about 5.1 billion a year on an investment portfolio of 261 billion in October 2007 and down to 186 billion in October 2008. This is a 2.5% return on investment over the 11-year period. Income or loss from investments fluctuates from year to year; between 1998‚Äì99 and 2007‚Äì08, the highest income was $40.7 billion in 2006-07 and the greatest loss was $12.5 billion in 2007‚Äì08.

The list was also referred to as a \\"name and shame\\" list. Beginning in 2010, CalPERS stopped publicly naming companies on the list and instead began dealing with such companies privately. In 2012, CalPERS initiated a program to monetize the Focus List. Each year, after the Board approves staff recommendations for Focus List companies, CalPERS increases investments in those companies. New Focus List companies are added to the portfolio each year, and the portfolio is rebalanced so that holdings remain equally weighted. The purpose of monetizing the Focus List is to replicate the Wilshire studies‚Äîusing actual funds to demonstrate and measure the ‚ÄúCalPERS Effect.‚Äù Monetizing the Focus List also allows CalPERS to realize a return on the increased value that typically occurs following an engagement. In 2014, a study by Wilshire Associates showed the companies engaged by CalPERS significantly outperformed the Russell 1000. Analysis of performance of companies on the Focus List In 1994, Nesbitt published a study that found that companies on the Focus List trailed the S&P; 500 prior to being put on the list, but outperformed the S&P; 500 after being put on the list, and named this phenomenon the \\"CalPERS effect\\".Nesbitt, Stephen L.

After the financial crisis of 2007‚Äì2008, many cities in California came under financial stress due to a combination of factors, which led to three high-profile municipal bankruptcy filings by Vallejo, Stockton, and San Bernardino that received nationwide attention. During the proceedings some creditors accused CalPERS's increased post-crisis employer payments and future unfunded liabilities as a cause of insolvency and sought to have CalPERS employer contributions reduced.

Unfunded Liabilities Crisis CalPERS faces significant unfunded liabilities which is likely to challenge its long-term financial stability. Official estimates place the liabilities at approximately $150 billion, an increase from $22 billion in 2002. The unfunded liabilities figure is a projection that takes into account returns on CalPERS investments. The $150 billion figure is based on a long term return of 7%; if the returns are higher, the true liability is much smaller, but if returns are lower than the liabilities are much larger. CalPERS itself projects that it will return 6.1% over the next decade and 8.3% for the decade after that. There are significant concerns that to keep up, contributions by municipal and state authorities will have to rise drastically, putting financial strain on those authorities. According to the CalPERS chart Historical Factors Impact Funded Status (1993-2018), the most recent year with no unfunded liabilities was FY 2007. Criticisms CalPERS has received criticism for the number of retirees (26,000 in 2018) who collect over $100,000 a year in pension. That group of people, while less than 4 percent of the total number of retirees receiving benefits from CalPERS, collect 17 percent of the total yearly pension payouts.

After years of preliminary exploration and military skirmishes, 168 Spanish soldiers under conquistador Francisco Pizarro, his brothers, and their native allies captured the Sapa Inca Atahualpa in the 1532 Battle of Cajamarca. It was the first step in a long campaign that took decades of fighting but ended in Spanish victory in 1572 and colonization of the region as the Viceroyalty of Peru. The conquest of the Inca Empire (called \\"Tahuantinsuyu\\" or \\"Tawantinsuyu\\" in Quechua, meaning \\"Realm of the Four Parts\\"), led to spin-off campaigns into present-day Chile and Colombia, as well as expeditions towards the Amazon Basin. When the Spanish arrived at the borders of the Inca Empire in 1528, it spanned a considerable area and was by far the largest of the four grand pre-Columbian civilizations. Extending southward from the Ancomayo, which is now known as the Pat√≠a River, in southern present-day Colombia to the Maule River in what would later be known as Chile, and eastward from the Pacific Ocean to the edge of the Amazonian jungles, and covered some of the most mountainous terrain on Earth. In less than a century, the Inca had expanded their empire from about in 1448 to in 1528, just before the arrival of the Spanish. This vast area of land varied greatly in cultures and in climate. Because of the diverse cultures and geography, the Inca allowed many areas of the empire to be governed under the control of local leaders, who were watched and monitored by Inca officials. Under the administrative mechanisms established by the Inca, all parts of the empire answered to, and were ultimately under the direct control of, the Emperor.Covey (2000). Scholars estimate that the population of the Inca Empire was more than 16,000,000.Means (1932). Some scholars, such as Jared Diamond, believe that while the Spanish conquest was undoubtedly the proximate cause of the collapse of the Inca Empire, it may very well have been past its peak and already in the process of decline. In 1528, Emperor Huayna Capac ruled the Inca Empire. He could trace his lineage back to a \\"stranger king\\" named Manco C√°pac, the mythical founder of the Inca clan, who according to tradition emerged from a cave in a region called Paqariq Tampu. Huayna Capac was the son of the previous ruler, T√∫pac Inca, and the grandson of Pachacuti, the Emperor who, by conquest, had commenced the dramatic expansion of the Inca Empire from its cultural and traditional base in the area around Cusco. On his accession to the throne, Huayna Capac had continued the policy of expansion by conquest, taking Inca armies north into what is today Ecuador.Prescott, W.H., 2011, The History of the Conquest of Peru, Digireads.com Publishing, While he had to put down a number of rebellions during his reign, by the time of his death, his legitimacy was as unquestioned as was the primacy of Inca power. Expansion had resulted in its own problems. Many parts of the empire maintained distinctive cultures and these were at best reluctant participants in the imperial project. The large extent of the empire, the extremely difficult terrain of much of it, and the fact that all communication and travel had to take place on foot or by boat, seems to have caused increasing difficulty in the Incas' effective administration of the empire. Huayna Capac relied on his sons to support his reign. While he had many legitimate and illegitimate children (legitimate meaning born of his sister-wife, under the Inca system), two sons are historically important. Prince T√∫pac Cusi Hualpa, also known as Hu√°scar, was the son of Coya Mama Rahua Occllo of the royal line. The second was Atahualpa, an illegitimate son who was likely born of a daughter of the last independent King of Quitu, one of the states conquered by Huayna Capac during the expansion of the Inca Empire. These two sons would play pivotal roles in the final years of the Inca Empire. The Spanish conquistador Pizarro and his men were greatly aided in their enterprise by invading when the Inca Empire was in the midst of a war of succession between the princes Hu√°scar and Atahualpa. Atahualpa seems to have spent more time with Huayna Capac during the years when he was in the north with the army conquering Ecuador. Atahualpa was thus closer to, and had better relations with the army and its leading generals. When both Huayna Capac and his eldest son and designated heir, Ninan Cuyochic, died suddenly in 1528 from what was probably smallpox, a disease introduced by the Spanish into the Americas, the question of who would succeed as emperor was thrown open. Huayna had died before he could nominate the new heir. At the time of Huayna Capac's death, Hu√°scar was in the capital Cuzco, while Atahualpa was in Quitu with the main body of the Inca army. Hu√°scar had himself proclaimed Sapa Inca (i.e. \\"Only Emperor\\") in Cuzco, but the army declared loyalty to Atahualpa. The resulting dispute led to the Inca Civil War.

Beginning of the conflict  The civil war between Atahualpa and Huascar weakened the empire immediately prior to its struggle with the Spanish. Historians are unsure of whether a united Inca Empire could have defeated the Spanish in the long term due to factors such as the high mortality from disease and its related social disruption, and the superior military technology of the conquistadors, who possessed horses, dogs, metal armor, swords, cannons, and primitive, but effective, firearms.Kubler (1945). Atahualpa appeared to be more popular with the people than his brother, and he was certainly more valued by the army, the core of which was based in the recently conquered northern province of Quitu. At the outset of the conflict, each brother controlled his respective domains, with Atahualpa secure in the north, and Hu√°scar controlling the capital of Cuzco and the large territory to the south, including the area around Lake Titicaca. This region had supplied large numbers of troops for Hu√°scar's forces. After a period of diplomatic posturing and jockeying for position, open warfare broke out. Hu√°scar seemed poised to bring the war to a rapid conclusion, as troops loyal to him took Atahualpa prisoner, while he was attending a festival in the city of Tumibamba. However, Atahualpa quickly escaped and returned to Quitu. There, he was able to amass what is estimated to be at least 30,000 soldiers. While Hu√°scar managed to muster about the same number of soldiers, they were less experienced. Atahualpa sent his forces south under the command of two of his leading generals, Challcuchima and Quisquis, who won an uninterrupted series of victories that soon brought them to the very gates of Cuzco. On the first day of the battle for Cuzco, the forces loyal to Hu√°scar gained an early advantage. However, on the second day, Hu√°scar personally led an ill-advised \\"surprise\\" attack, of which the generals Challcuchima and Quisquis had advance knowledge. In the ensuing battle, Hu√°scar was captured, and resistance completely collapsed. The victorious generals sent word north by chasqui messenger to Atahualpa, who had moved south from Quitu to the royal resort springs outside Cajamarca. The messenger arrived with news of the final victory on the same day that Pizarro and his small band of adventurers, together with some indigenous allies, descended from the Andes into the town of Cajamarca.  Arrival of Pizarro  The Famous Thirteen by Juan Lepiani Francisco Pizarro and his brothers (Gonzalo, Juan, and Hernando) were attracted by the news of a rich and fabulous kingdom. They had left the then impoverished Extremadura, like many migrants after them. In 1529, Francisco Pizarro obtained permission from the Spanish Monarchy to conquer the land they called Peru. According to historian Ra√∫l Porras Barrenechea, Peru is not a Quechuan nor Caribbean word, but Indo-Hispanic or hybrid. Unknown to Pizarro, as he was lobbying for permission to mount an expedition, his proposed enemy was being devastated by the diseases brought to the American continents during earlier Spanish contacts. When Pizarro arrived in Peru in 1532, he found it vastly different from when he had been there just five years before. Amid the ruins of the city of Tumbes, he tried to piece together the situation before him. From two young local boys whom he had taught how to speak Spanish in order to translate for him, Pizarro learned of the civil war and of the disease that was destroying the Inca Empire. After four long expeditions, Pizarro established the first Spanish settlement in northern Peru, calling it San Miguel de Piura. Francisco Pizarro meets with Atahualpa, 1532 When first spotted by the natives, Pizarro and his men were thought to be viracocha cuna or \\"gods\\". The Natives described Pizarro's men to the Inca. They said that capito was tall with a full beard and was completely wrapped in clothing. The Natives described the men's swords and how they killed sheep with them. The men did not eat human flesh, but rather sheep, lamb, duck, pigeons, and deer, and cooked the meat. Atahualpa was fearful of what the white men were capable of. If they were runa quicachac or \\"destroyers of peoples,\\" then he should flee. If they were viracocha cuna runa allichac or \\"gods who are benefactors of the people,\\" then he should not flee, but welcome them. The messengers went back to Tangarala, and Atahualpa sent Cinquinchara, an Orejon warrior, to the Spanish to serve as an interpreter. After traveling with the Spanish, Cinquinchara returned to Atahualpa; they discussed whether or not the Spanish men were gods. Cinquinchara decided they were men because he saw them eat, drink, dress, and have relations with women. He saw them produce no miracles. Cinquinchara informed Atahualpa that they were small in number, about 170‚Äì180 men, and had bound the Native captives with \\"iron ropes\\". When Atahualpa asked what to do about the strangers, Cinquinchara said that they should be killed because they were evil thieves who took whatever they wanted, and were supai cuna or \\"devils\\". He recommended trapping the men inside of their sleeping quarters and burning them to death.Betanzos et al. (1996). At this point, Pizarro had 168 men under his command: 106 on foot and 62 on horses. Pizarro sent his captain Hernando de Soto to invite Atahualpa to a meeting. Soto rode to meet Atahualpa on his horse, an animal that Atahualpa had never seen before. With one of his young interpreters, Soto read a prepared speech to Atahualpa telling him that they had come as servants of God to teach them the truth about God's word.Seed (1991). He said he was speaking to them so that they might > \\"lay the foundation of concord, brotherhood, and perpetual peace that should > exist between us, so that you may receive us under your protection and hear > the divine law from us and all your people may learn and receive it, for it > will be the greatest honor, advantage, and salvation to them all.\\" Atahualpa responded only after Hernando Pizarro arrived. He replied with what he had heard from his scouts, saying that Pizarro and his men were killing and enslaving countless numbers on the coast. Pizarro denied the report and Atahualpa, with limited information, reluctantly let the matter go. At the end of their meeting, the men agreed to meet the next day at Cajamarca.  Capture of Atahualpa  After his victory and the death of his brother Hu√°scar, Atahualpa was fasting in the Inca baths outside Cajamarca. Pizarro and his men reached that city on 15 November 1532. Pizarro sent Hernando de Soto and Hernando Pizarro to the Inca leader's camp. Hernando Pizarro and De Soto explained they were emissaries of Emperor Charles I of Spain, to offer their services, and \\"impart to him the doctrines of the true faith.\\" Additionally, they invited the Incan leader to visit Pizarro at his quarters along the Cajamarca plaza. Atahualpa replied that his fast would end the next day, when he would visit Pizarro. When De Soto noticed Atahualpa's interest in his horse, he put on a display of \\"excellent horsemanship\\" in close proximity. Atahualpa displayed hospitality by serving refreshments.Innes (1969). The Inca‚ÄìSpanish confrontation in the Battle of Cajamarca left thousands of natives dead The next morning, Pizarro had arranged an ambuscade around the Cajamarca plaza, where they were to meet. When Atahualpa arrived with about 6,000 unarmed followers, Friar Vincente de Valverde and Felipillo met them and proceeded to \\"expound the doctrines of the true faith\\" (requerimiento) and seek his tribute as a vassal of King Charles. The unskilled translator likely contributed to problems in communication. The friar offered Atahualpa the Bible as the authority of what he had just stated. Atahualpa stated, \\"I will be no man's tributary.\\" Pizarro urged attack starting the Battle of Cajamarca on 16 November 1532. Though the historical accounts relating to these circumstances vary, the true Spanish motives for the attack seemed to be a desire for loot and flat-out impatience. The Inca likely did not adequately understand the conquistadors' demands. And, of course, Pizarro knew they did not have the slightest chance against the Inca army unless they captured the Emperor. At the signal to attack, the Spaniards unleashed volleys of gunfire at the vulnerable mass of Incas and surged forward in a concerted action. The effect was devastating, the shocked Incas offered such feeble resistance that the battle has often been labeled a massacre, with the Inca losing 2,000 dead. Pizarro also used cavalry charges against the Inca forces, which stunned them in combination with gunfire. The majority of Atahualpa's troops were in the Cuzco region along with Quisquis and Challcuchima, the two generals he trusted the most. This was a major disadvantage for the Inca. Their undoing also resulted from a lack of self-confidence, and a desire to make public demonstration of fearlessness and godlike command of situation. The main view is that the Inca were eventually defeated due to inferior weapons, 'open battle' tactics, disease, internal unrest, the bold tactics of the Spanish, and the capture of their emperor. While Spanish armour was very effective against most of the Andean weapons, it was not impenetrable to maces, clubs, or slings. However, ensuing hostilities such as the Mixt√≥n Rebellion, Chichimeca War, and Arauco War would require that the conquistadors ally with friendly tribes in these later expeditions. The battle began with a shot from a cannon and the battle cry \\"Santiago!\\" Many of the guns used by the Spaniards were hard to use in the frequent close-combat situations. Most natives adapted in 'guerrilla fashion' by only shooting at the legs of the conquistadors if they happened to be unarmored. During Atahualpa's captivity, the Spanish, although greatly outnumbered, forced him to order his generals to back down by threatening to kill him if he did not. According to the Spanish envoy's demands, Atahualpa offered to fill a large room with gold and promised the Spanish twice that amount in silver. While Pizarro ostensibly accepted this offer and allowed the gold to pile up, he had no intention of releasing the Inca; he needed Atahualpa's influence over his generals and the people in order to maintain the peace. When Atahualpa was captured at the massacre at Cajamarca, he was treated with respect, allowed his wives to join him, and the Spanish soldiers taught him the game of chess.Leon, P., 1998, The Discovery and Conquest of Peru, Chronicles of the New World Encounter, edited and translated by Cook and Cook, Durham: Duke University Press, Francisco Pizarro sent his brother Hernando to gather gold and silver from the temples in Pachacamac in January 1533, and on his return in March, captured Chalcuchimac in the Jauja Valley. Francisco Pizzaro sent a similar expedition to Cuzco, bringing back many gold plates from the Temple of the Sun. By February 1533, Almagro had joined Pizarro in Cajamarca with an additional 150 men with 50 horses. Pizarro held Atahualpa for a ransom of gold and silver; the treasure began to be delivered from Cuzco on 20 December 1532 and flowed steadily from then on. By 3 May 1533 Pizarro received all the treasure he had requested; it was melted, refined, and made into bars. One of the main events in the conquest of Peru was the death of Atahualpa, the last Sapa Inca on 29 August 1533 The question eventually came up of what to do with Atahualpa; both Pizarro and Soto were against killing him, but the other Spaniards were loud in their demands for death. False interpretations from the interpreter Felipillo made the Spaniards paranoid. They were told that Atahualpa had ordered secret attacks and his warriors were hidden in the surrounding area. Soto went with a small army to look for the hidden army, but a trial for Atahualpa was held in his absence. Among the charges were polygamy, incestuous marriage, and idolatry, all frowned upon in Catholicism but common in Inca culture and religion. The men who were against Atahualpa's conviction and murder argued that he should be judged by King Charles since he was the sovereign prince. Atahualpa agreed to accept baptism to avoid being burned at the stake and in the hopes of one day rejoining his army and killing the Spanish; he was baptized as Francisco. On 29 August 1533 Atahualpa was garrotted and died a Christian. He was buried with Christian rites in the church of San Francisco at Cajamarca, but was soon disinterred. His body was taken, probably at his prior request, to its final resting place in Quito. Upon de Soto's return, he was furious; he had found no evidence of any secret gathering of Atahualpa's warriors. Pizarro advanced with his army of 500 Spaniards toward Cuzco, accompanied by Chalcuchimac. The latter was burned alive in the Jauja Valley, accused of secret communication with Quizquiz, and organizing resistance. Manco Inca Yupanqui joined Pizarro after the death of T√∫pac Huallpa. Pizarro's force entered the heart of the Tawantinsuyu on 15 November 1533. Benalc√°zar, Pizarro's lieutenant and fellow Extremaduran, had already departed from San Miguel with 140-foot soldiers and a few horses on his conquering mission to Ecuador. At the foot of Mount Chimborazo, near the modern city of Riobamba (Ecuador) he met and defeated the forces of the great Inca warrior Rumi√±awi with the aid of Ca√±ari tribesmen who served as guides and allies to the conquering Spaniards. Rumi√±ahui fell back to Quito, and, while in pursuit of the Inca army, Benalc√°zar was joined by five hundred men led by Guatemalan Governor Pedro de Alvarado. Greedy for gold, Alvarado had set sail for the south without the crown's authorization, landed on the Ecuadorian coast, and marched inland to the Sierra. Finding Quito empty of its treasures, Alvarado soon joined the combined Spanish force. Alvarado agreed to sell his fleet of twelve ships, his forces, plus arms and ammunition, and returned to Guatemala. Rebellion and reconquest After Atahualpa's execution, Pizarro installed Atahualpa's brother, T√∫pac Huallpa, as a puppet Inca ruler, but he soon died unexpectedly, leaving Manco Inca Yupanqui in power. He began his rule as an ally of the Spanish and was respected in the southern regions of the empire, but there was still much unrest in the north near Quito where Atahualpa's generals were amassing troops. Atahualpa's death meant that there was no hostage left to deter these northern armies from attacking the invaders. Led by Atahualpa's generals Rumi√±ahui, Zope-Zupahua and Quisquis, the native armies were finally defeated, effectively ending any organized rebellion in the north of the empire. Manco Inca initially had good relations with Francisco Pizarro and several other Spanish conquistadors. However, in 1535 he was left in Cuzco under the control of Pizarro's brothers, Juan and Gonzalo, who so mistreated Manco Inca that he ultimately rebelled. Under the pretense of recovering a statue of pure gold in the nearby Yucay valley, Manco was able to escape Cuzco. Spaniards executing Tupac Amaru I. Manco Inca hoped to use the disagreement between Almagro and Pizarro to his advantage and attempted the recapture of Cuzco starting in April 1536. The siege of Cuzco was waged until the following spring, and during that time Manco's armies managed to wipe out four relief columns sent from Lima, but was ultimately unsuccessful in its goal of routing the Spaniards from the city. The Inca leadership did not have the full support of all its subject peoples and furthermore, the degrading state of Inca morale coupled with the superior Spanish siege weapons soon made Manco Inca realize his hope of recapturing Cuzco was failing. Manco Inca eventually withdrew to Tambo. Archaeological evidence of the rebellion incident exists. The remains of about 70 men, women, and adolescents were found in the path of a planned expressway near Lima in 2007. Forensic evidence suggests that the natives were killed by European weapons, probably during the uprising in 1536. After the Spanish regained control of Cuzco, Manco Inca and his armies retreated to the fortress at Ollantaytambo where he, for a time, successfully launched attacks against Pizarro based at Cuzco and even managed to defeat the Spanish in an open battle. When it became clear that defeat was imminent, Manco Inca retreated further to the mountainous region of Vilcabamba and established the small Neo- Inca State, where Manco Inca and his successors continued to hold some power for several more decades. His son, T√∫pac Amaru, was the last Inca. After deadly confrontations, he was murdered by the Spanish in 1572. In total, the conquest took about forty years to complete. Many Inca attempts to regain the empire had occurred, but none had been successful. Thus the Spanish conquest was achieved through relentless force, and deception, aided by factors like smallpox and a great communication and cultural divide. The Spaniards destroyed much of the Incan culture and introduced the Spanish culture to the native population.  Aftermath  Pizarro and his followers founding Lima A struggle for power resulted in a long civil war between Francisco Pizarro and Diego de Almagro in which Almagro was killed. Almagro's loyal followers and his descendants later avenged his death by killing Pizarro in 1541. This was done inside the palace of Francisco Pizarro in a fight to the death by these assassins, most of which were former soldiers of Diego de Almagro who were stripped of title and belongings after his death.Koch, Peter O. ‚ÄúThe Spanish Conquest of the Inca Empire‚Äù, McFarland & Company, Inc., Publishers, Jefferson, North Carolina, and London, 2008. Despite the war, the Spaniards did not neglect the colonizing process. Spanish royal authority on these territories was consolidated by the creation of an Audiencia Real, a type of appellate court. In January 1535, Lima was founded, from which the political and administrative institutions were to be organized. In 1542, the Spanish created the Viceroyalty of New Castile, that shortly after would be called Viceroyalty of Peru. Nevertheless, the Viceroyalty of Peru was not organized until the arrival of a later Viceroy Francisco de Toledo in 1572. Toledo ended the indigenous Neo-Inca State in Vilcabamba, executing the Inca T√∫pac Amaru. He promoted economic development using commercial monopoly and built up the extraction from the silver mines of Potos√≠, using slavery based on the Inca institution of forced labor for mandatory public service called mita. The integration of Spanish culture into Peru was carried out not only by Pizarro and his other captains, but also by the many Spanish who also came to Peru to exploit its riches and inhabit its land. These included many different kinds of immigrants such as Spanish merchants, peasants, artisans, and Spanish women. Another element that the Spanish brought with them were African slaves to work alongside captive Incas for use in labor with things such as agriculture and mining for silver.Lockhart, James. Spanish Peru, University of Wisconsin Press. These people all brought with them their own pieces of Spanish culture to integrate into Peruvian society. The arrival of the Spanish also had an unexpected impact on the land itself, recent research points out that Spanish conquest of the Inca altered Peru's shoreline. Before the Spaniards arrived, inhabitants of the arid northern Peruvian coast clad massive sand dune‚Äìlike ridges with a -likely- accidental form of ‚Äúarmor‚Äù, millions of discarded mollusk shells, which protected the ridges from erosion for nearly 4700 years prior to the Spanish arrival, and produced a vast corrugated landscape that is visible from space. This incidental landscape protection came to a swift end, however, after diseases brought by Spanish colonists decimated the local population and after colonial officials resettled the survivors inland, without humans to create the protective covering, newly formed beach ridges simply eroded and vanished.Belknap, Daniel F. and Sandweiss, Daniel H. ‚ÄúEffects of the Spanish Conquest on coastal change in Northwestern Peru‚Äù, Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences of the United States of America, 111: 7986-7989. According to Archaeologist Torben Rick, parts of the northern coast of Peru may look completely natural and pristine, ‚Äúbut if you rewind the clock a couple of millennia, you see that people were actively shaping this land by creating beach ridge systems\\". Almost nothing was left of the Inca civilizations after the conquest by the Spanish, as culture was not as significant as gold to the new conquerors. The unique indigenous road and communications systems were essentially lost. The only things that persisted of the original culture are the very few artifacts that remained and the minute cultural aspects, such as language, that was left behind by the small percentage of Incas who persisted. (survived) = Effects of the conquest on the people of Peru = The long-term effects of the arrival of the Spanish on the population of South America were simply catastrophic. While this is the case for every group of Native-Americans that were invaded by Europeans from the fifteenth century onwards, the Incan population suffered a dramatic and quick decline following contact. It is estimated that parts of the empire, notably the Central Andes, suffered a population decline ratio of 58:1 during the years of 1520‚Äì1571.Newson (1985). The single greatest cause of the decimation of native populations was infectious disease. Old World Eurasian diseases, which had long been endemic on the Continent, were carried by colonists and conquistadors. As these were new to the natives, they had no acquired immunity and suffered very high rates of death. More died of disease than any army or armed conflict.The Story Of... Smallpox ‚Äì and other Deadly Eurasian Germs As the Inca did not have as strong a writing tradition as the Aztec or Maya, it is difficult for historians to estimate population decline or any events after conquest. But, it is sometimes argued, and equally disputed among scholars. that the Inca began to contract these diseases several years before the Spanish appeared in the region, as it was possibly carried to their empire by traders and travelers. The outbreak, argued to be hemorrhagic smallpox, reached the Andes in 1524. While numbers are unavailable, Spanish records indicate that the population was so devastated by disease that they could hardly resist the foreign forces. Historians differ as to whether the illness of the 1520s was smallpox; a minority of scholars claim that the epidemic was due to an indigenous illness called Carrion's disease. In any case, a 1981 study by N. D. Cook the shows that the Andes suffered from three separate population declines during colonization. The first was of 30‚Äì50 percent during the first outbreak of smallpox. When a measles outbreak occurred, there was another decline of 25‚Äì30 percent. Finally, when smallpox and measles epidemics occurred together, which occurred from 1585 to 1591, a decline of 30‚Äì60 percent occurred. Collectively these declines amounted to a decline of 93 percent from the pre-contact population in the Andes region.Lovell (1992). Mortality was particularly high among children, ensuring that the impact of the epidemics would extend to the next generation. Beyond the devastation of the local populations by disease, they suffered considerable enslavement, pillaging and destruction from warfare. The Spanish took thousands of women from the local natives to use as servants and concubines. As Pizarro and his men took over portions of South America, they plundered and enslaved countless people. Some local populations entered into vassalage willingly, to defeat the Inca. Native groups such as the Huanca, Ca√±ari, Chanka and Chachapoya fought alongside the Spanish as they opposed Inca rule. The basic policy of the Spanish towards local populations was that voluntary vassalage would yield safety and coexistence, while continued resistance would result in more deaths and destruction.Gibson (1978). Another significant effect on the people in South America was the spread of Christianity. As Pizarro and the Spanish subdued the continent and brought it under their control, they forcefully converted many to Christianity, claiming to have educated them in the ways of the \\"one true religion.\\" With the depopulation of the local populations along with the capitulation of the Inca Empire, the Spanish missionary work after colonization began was able to continue unimpeded. It took just a generation for the entire continent to be under Christian influence.  In fiction  Peter Shaffer's play The Royal Hunt of the Sun (1964) dramatizes the conquest of the Incas. In the play, Pizarro, Atahualpa, Valverde and other historical figures appear as characters. The conquest is also used as a starting point for the Matthew Reilly novel Temple, where the siege of Cusco is used. Many historical figures are mentioned, especially Pizarro who is mentioned as the pursuer of the protagonist. The Inca are featured in the third Campaign in Age of Empires 3, having a Lost City hidden in the Andes. They are also in the Multiplayer, found primarily in the areas making up Chile and Argentina. The conquest is parodied in The Simpsons TV series, in the episode \\"Lost Verizon\\", written by John Frink. Pizarro and his fellow conquistadors feature as antagonists in the 1982 animated serial The Mysterious Cities of Gold.

Examples include tightened airport security measures or other public transport security measures after major terrorist attacks.  Disadvantages  Security theater may not always have real monetary costs but by definition provides no security benefits, or the benefits are so minimal as to not be worth the cost. Security theater typically involves restricting or modifying aspects of people's behavior or surroundings in very visible and highly specific ways, which could involve potential restrictions of personal liberty and privacy, ranging from negligible (confiscating water bottles where bottled water can later be purchased) to significant (prolonged screening of individuals to the point of harassment). Critics such as the American Civil Liberties Union have argued that the benefits of security theater are temporary and illusory since after such security measures inevitably fail, not only is the feeling of insecurity increased, but there is also loss of belief in the competence of those responsible for security. Researchers such as Edward Felten have described the airport security repercussions due to the September 11, 2001 attacks as security theater. = Increased casualties = Two studies by a group of Cornell University researchers have found that strict airport security in the United States after the 9/11 attacks has the unintended consequence of increasing road fatalities, as would-be air travelers decide to drive and are exposed to the far greater risk of dying in a car accident. In 2005, the researchers looked at the immediate aftermath of the attacks of September 11, 2001, and found that the change in passenger travel modes led to 242 added driving deaths per month. In all, they estimated that about 1,200 driving deaths could be attributed to the short-term effects of the attacks. In 2007, the researchers studied the specific effects of a change to security practices instituted by the TSA in late 2002. They concluded that this change reduced the number of air travelers by 6%, and estimated that consequently, 129 more people died in car accidents in the fourth quarter of 2002. Extrapolating this rate of fatalities, New York Times contributor Nate Silver remarked that this is equivalent to \\"four fully loaded Boeing 737s crashing each year.\\" = Economic costs = The 2007 Cornell study also noted that strict airport security hurts the airline industry; it was estimated that the 6% reduction in the number of passengers in the fourth quarter of 2002 cost the industry $1.1 billion in lost business. The American Civil Liberties Union (ACLU) has reported that between October 2008 and June 2010, over 6,500 people traveling to and from the United States had their electronic devices searched at the border. The Association of Corporate Travel Executives, whose member companies are responsible for over 1 million travelers and represent over $300 billion in annual business travel expenditures, reported in February 2008 that 7% of their members had been subject to the seizure of a laptop or other electronic device. Electronic device seizure may have a severe economic and behavioral impact. Entrepreneurs for whom their laptop represents a mobile office can be deprived of their entire business. Fifty percent of the respondents to ACTE's survey indicated that having a laptop seizure could damage a traveler's professional standing within a company. The executive director of the Association of Corporate Travel Executives testified at a 2008 hearing of the Senate Judiciary Subcommittee on the Constitution seizure of data or computers carrying business proprietary information has forced and will force companies to implement new and expensive internal travel policies. = Increased risk of targeted attacks = The direct costs of security theater may be lower than that of more elaborate security measures. However, it may divert portions of the budget for effective security measures without resulting in an adequate, measurable gain in security. Because security theater measures are often so specific (such as concentrating on potential explosives in shoes), it allows potential attackers to divert to other methods of attack. This not only applies to the extremely specific measures, but can also involve possible tactics such as switching from using highly scrutinized airline passengers as attackers to getting attackers employed as airline or airport staff. Another alternate tactic would be simply avoiding attacking aircraft in favor of attacking other areas where sufficient damage would be done, such as check-in counters (as was done, for example, in the attacks on Brussels airport on 22 March 2016), or simply targeting other places where people gather in large numbers, such as cinemas.  Benefits  While it may seem that security theater must always cause loss, it may be beneficial, at least in a localized situation. This is because perception of security is sometimes more important than security itself. If the potential victims of an attack feel more protected and safer as a result of the measures, then they may carry on activities they would have otherwise avoided. In addition, if the security measures in place appear effective, potential attackers may be dissuaded from proceeding or may direct their attention to a target perceived as less secure. Unsophisticated adversaries in particular may be frightened by superficial impressions of security (such as seeing multiple people in uniform or observing cameras) and not even attempt to find weaknesses or determine effect.  Examples  Some measures which have been criticized as security theater include: =Airport security measures= * Many procedures of the Transportation Security Administration have been criticized as security theater. Specific measures critiqued as security theater include the \\"patting down the crotches of children, the elderly and even infants as part of the post-9/11 airport security show\\" and the use of full body scanners, which \\"are ineffective and can be easily manipulated.\\" Many measures are put in place in reaction to past threats and \\"are ineffective at actually stopping terrorism, as potential attackers can simply change tactics.\\" * The use of Computer Assisted Passenger Prescreening System (CAPPS) and its successor, Secure Flight ‚Äì programs which rely on static screening of airline passenger profiles to choose which people should be searched ‚Äì has been criticized as ineffective security theater.Bruce Schneier, Airline Security a Waste of Cash, Wired (December 1, 2005). The TSA's Registered Traveler Program and Trusted Traveler Program have been criticized on similar grounds. The CAPPS has been demonstrated to reduce the effectiveness of searching below that of random searches since terrorists can test the system and use those who are searched least often for their operations. * A 2010 Government Accountability Office (GAO) report found that the TSA's $900 million Screening Passengers by Observation Techniques (SPOT) program, a behavioral-detection program introduced in 2007 that is aimed at detecting terrorists, had detected no terrorists and failed to detect at least 16 people who had traveled through airports where the program was in use and were later involved in terrorism cases.Jana Winter & Cora Currier, Exclusive: TSA‚Äôs Secret Behavior Checklist to Spot TerroristsKevin D. Williamson, The TSA's 95 Percent Failure Rate: Security Theater as Farce, National Review (June 3, 2015). In 2013, a GAO report found that no evidence existed to support the idea that \\"behavioral indicators ... can be used to identify persons who may pose a risk to aviation security.\\" A separate 2013 report by the Department of Homeland Security Office of Inspector General found that the TSA had failed to evaluate the SPOT program and could not \\"show that the program is cost effective.\\" The SPOT program has been described as security theater.Jeffrey Goldberg, The Things He Carried, The Atlantic (November 2008).Thomas Cincotta, Behavior Profiling: Ineffective and Expensive Security Theater, Political Research Associates (July 29, 2010). * With the aim of preventing individuals on a No Fly List from flying in commercial airliners, U.S. airports require all passengers to show valid picture ID (e.g. a passport or driver's license) along with their boarding pass before entering the boarding terminal. At this checkpoint, the name on the ID is matched to that on the boarding pass, but is not recorded. In order to be effective, this practice must assume that 1) the ticket was bought under the passenger's real name (at which point the name was recorded and checked against the No Fly List), 2) the boarding pass shown is real, and 3) the ID shown is real. However, the rise of print-at-home boarding passes, which can be easily forged, allows a potential attacker to buy a ticket under someone else's name, to go into the boarding terminal using a real ID and a fake boarding pass, and then to fly on the ticket that has someone else's name on it. Additionally, a 2007 investigation showed that obviously false IDs could be used when claiming a boarding pass and entering the departures terminal, so a person on the No Fly List can simply travel under a different name. * Facial recognition technology was introduced at Manchester Airport in August 2008. A journalist for The Register claimed that \\"the gates in Manchester were throwing up so many false results that staff effectively turned them off. Previously matches had to be 80% the same to their passport pictures to go through, and this was quickly changed to 30%. According to Rob Jenkins, a facial recognition expert at Glasgow University, when testing similar machines at a 30% recognition level, the machines were unable to distinguish between the faces of Osama bin Laden and Winona Ryder, bin Laden and Kevin Spacey, nor between Gordon Brown and Mel Gibson. =Random search programs on public transit and in other public places= * Random bag searches on subway systems ‚Äì a practice that has been used on the Washington Metro and on New York City mass transit ‚Äì have been condemned as ineffective security theater and a waste of resources.Markus Rauschecker, Metro's Random Bag Searches: Reasonableness, Randomness, and \\"Security Theater\\", University of Maryland Center for Health and Homeland Security (January 7, 2011).Ann Scott Tyson, Metro bag searches criticized by public, Washington Post (January 4, 2011). Such programs have also been criticized by members of the public and civil liberties groups. After eighteen months of random bag checks by the Metro Transit Police from December 2010, the Washington Metropolitan Area Transit Authority reported that the program, which was funded by a federal homeland security grant, had yielded zero arrests.Benjamin R. Freed, Metro's Bag Searches Are Pretty Empty, It Turns Out , DCist (June 12, 2012). * Similarly, the Chicago Transit Authority police's deployment of random explosive-residue-swabbing checkpoints at public transit stations has been criticized as ineffective security theater.Tim Cushing, Chicago Transit Cops Start Up Their Own Security Theater, Will Start Randomly Swabbing Bags For Explosive Residue, TechDirt (November 6, 2014). * Pat-downs of fans entering arenas for National Football League games has been criticized as security theater.Timothy Geigner, NFL Ramps Up Security Theatre, TechDirt (September 21, 2011). * Metal detectors at Major League Baseball games have also been criticized as ineffective security theater.Bruce Schneier, Baseball's new metal detectors won't keep you safe. They'll just make you miss a few innings., The Washington Post (April 14, 2015). =Other= * One commentator has \\"publicized database initiatives\\" generally as \\"acts of Security Theater,\\" writing: \\"An inherently intuitive allure attaches to scanning massive amounts of data in dimly lit control rooms, using sophisticated algorithms and scientific computer-matching methods to predict future behaviors and identify suspect individuals. This approach looks smart and makes some people feel safer....Accumulation of more data to the layman suggests not only better information, but potential for better intelligence. Yet, data mining is inherently flawed in its ability to find 'extremely rare instances of patterns across an extremely wide variety of activities and hidden relationships among individuals,' and encourages 'fishing expeditions.'\\"Candice L. Kline, Security Theater and Database-Driven Information Markets: A Case for an Omnibus U.S. Data Statute, 39 U. Tol. L. Rev. 443 (2008). * The draft Communications Data Bill (\\"snoopers' charter\\") proposed by the British government under Prime Minister David Cameron and Home Secretary Theresa May has been criticized as security theater.Ray Corrigan, World War II is long over, but the fight agains [sic] oppressive, invasive state laws continues, Open University (May 12, 2015). Similarly, Cameron's proposal to ban encryption in the UK has been criticized as ineffective security theater.Bruce Schneier, David Cameron's Plan to Ban Encryption in the UK, Schneier on Security (January 13, 2015). * During the COVID-19 pandemic some measures such as surface sanitation and temperature checks have been criticized as security theater Etymology The term security theater was coined by computer security specialist and writer Bruce Schneier for his book Beyond Fear, but has gained currency in security circles, particularly for describing airport security measures.

Lance J. Williams (September 25, 1949 ‚Äì August 20, 2017) was a prominent graphics researcher who made major contributions to texture map prefiltering, shadow rendering algorithms, facial animation, and antialiasing techniques. Williams was one of the first people to recognize the potential of computer graphics to transform film and video making. Williams died at 67 years old on August 20th, 2017, after a battle with cancer. He is survived by his wife and two children. Education Williams was an Honors student majoring in English with a minor in Asian Studies at the University of Kansas and graduated with a B.A. in 1972. While a student at KU he competed in collegiate chess tournaments and is said to have had a rating of 1800. He was drawn to the University of Utah by a \\"Humanistic Computation\\" summer seminar held by Jef Raskin at KU. He joined the graduate Computer Science program at the University of Utah in 1973 and studied computer graphics and animation under Ivan Sutherland, David Evans, and Steven Coons . At this time in the early 1970s, the University of Utah was the hub for much of the pioneering work being done in computer graphics. Lance left Utah (having completed his PhD course work and exams except the writing of a thesis) in 1977 to join the New York Institute of Technology (NYIT). While at NYIT, Williams invented the mipmapping technique for texture filtering, which is ubiquitously used today by graphics hardware for PCs and video games, and wrote and directed the abandoned project The Works which would have been the first entirely 3D CGI film had it been finished in the early 1980s as intended. Williams was awarded his PhD in 2000 from the University of Utah based on a rule allowing someone who published three seminal papers in his field to bind them together as his thesis. The three papers are Casting Curved Shadows on Curved Surfaces (1978), Pyramidal Parametrics (1983) and View Interpolation for Image Synthesis (1993). Professional career Williams worked at the New York Institute of Technology (NYIT) from 1976-1986 on research and commercial animation, and the development of shadow mapping and \\"mip\\" texture mapping. Subsequently Williams consulted for Jim Henson Associates, independently developed facial tracking for computer animation, worked for six years in Apple Computer's Advanced Technology Group starting in 1987. While there he collaborated with Eric Chen to pioneer early image based rendering work, developed \\"Virtual Integral Holography,\\" (with Dan Venolia), created 3D paint systems and contributed to QuickTime VR. He has pioneered work in motion capture facial animation systems for over 20 years. In 1997, Williams joined DreamWorks SKG. In 2002 he became Chief Scientist at Walt Disney Animation Studios. In 2006, Williams joined Google and worked with the Google Geo Group (Maps and Earth). In 2008 he was a Principal Member of Research Staff at Nokia and as of 2012, he joined NVIDIA Research.

On 20 August 1808 he was created Comte de Belgrand de Vaubois. Later, his name was inscribed on the Arc de Triomphe (Arche Kl√©ber) in Paris. Early life Vaubois was born at Clairvaux (now part of Ville-sous-la-Fert√©, Aube). In 1765 he was appointed a lieutenant of artillery in the Regiment of Metz. In 1789 he was appointed a Captain Commandant of Artillery. In 1791 he became a lieutenant colonel of volunteers. During service with the Army of the Alps, he was promoted to general of brigade in September 1793 and to general of division in 1796. After transferring to General Napoleon Bonaparte's Army of Italy, he led his troops in the capture of Livorno. Appointed to command a division in the Bassano campaign, he participated in the victory at the Battle of Rovereto on 4 September.Chandler, p 458 During the Arcola campaign, Vaubois defended Trento with a 10,500-man division. Paul Davidovich's Austrian corps proved to be unexpectedly strong and fell upon Vaubois with 18,000 men. In a series of skirmishes, Vaubois was driven out of Trento and pushed back to Calliano where his command was defeated on 7 November. Bonaparte arrived to stabilize the situation but the French army commander left Vaubois to do the best he could while Bonaparte attacked the main Austrian army at Arcole. The French won the three-day battle of Arcole on 17 November, the same day that Davidovich beat Vaubois again at Rivoli Veronese. The defeat had little consequence, since Bonaparte soon massed against Davidovich and sent his corps fleeing northward. Soon after, Bonaparte gave Vaubois' division to Barth√©lemy Joubert. On 24 November 1796, Bonaparte wrote of him, \\"Vaubois is a brave man. Has the proper qualifications for the commander of a besieged place but not for the commander of a division in a very active army or in a war so vigorously conducted as this.\\"Fiebeger, study folder, p 13 The events of 1798-1800 were to prove he was certainly the right choice to command a besieged place.  Belgrand de Vaubois in Malta  Today he is most often remembered in Malta, where Napoleon appointed him Commandant en chef des Isles de Malte et du Goze) on 19 June 1798, just seven days after the Knights Hospitaller, rulers of this archipelago from 1530, signed a surrender on board L‚ÄôOrient, Napoleon's flagship. Napoleon and his expedition then set sail for Egypt, with the Knight's treasure, worth five million francs in gold and one million in silver plate, on board the flagship. (Nelson's fleet destroyed L‚ÄôOrient on 1 August at Ab≈´ Qƒ´r Bay in the Battle of the Nile; the Knights' treasures are still on the bottom of sea there.) Napoleon left behind a garrison of 3,053 men, 5 companies of artillery and a medical unit in Malta and Gozo. The French proceeded to institute a number of policies. They declared the French language to be the official language. Although the French initially tried to win the support of the Catholic Church, they soon came into conflict with the Maltese Church as they instituted French revolutionary reforms. They abolished papal jurisdiction, authorized civil marriage, expelled all priests, regular clergy and nuns who were not native of Malta, and plundered the churches of gold and silver artifacts and paintings. The plundering of their churches outraged the staunchly pious Maltese. Furthermore, French draining of most of the cash of the Monte di Piet√† and the Massa frumentaria precipitated an unprecedented financial crisis. On 2 September 1798 the Maltese rose against the French garrison in Notabile (Citt√† Vecchia or Mdina). Soon both Malta and Gozo were in full rebellion, with the Maltese forming a National Assembly. They dispatched to a petition to Ferdinand I of the Two Sicilies, their official Suzerain, in Naples, to help them in their struggle against the French occupiers. Though Ferdinand promised much, he did little, having enough of his own troubles to worry much about his loyal Maltese subjects. = Insurrection and the arrival of the British = Still, on 18 September, a Portuguese squadron of four ships began a blockade of Malta. That blockade - although varying in the number and national composition of the ships - continued until the French surrendered. Nelson dispatched British forces under the command of Captain Alexander Ball, who arrived on 12 October 1798. The Maltese insurrectionist forces forced the French to withdraw to Valletta and the Three Cities around the Grand Harbour. On 28 October Gozo Island fell as the French commander there surrendered himself and his 217 men to Captain Ball. With General Vaubois's forces besieged in Valletta, Captain Ball's ships continued the blockade. Expecting the imminent French capitulation, Nelson wrote to Ball in January 1799: \\"...Respecting the situation of Malta with the King of Naples, it is this - he is the legitimate Sovereign of the Island: therefore, I am of opinion his Flag should fly. At the same time, a Neapolitan garrison would betray it to the first man who would bribe him. I am sure the King would have no difficulty in giving his Sovereignty to England; and I have lately, with Sir William Hamilton, got a Note that Malta should never be given to any Power without the consent of England... \\"P.S. - In case of the Surrender of Malta, I beg you will not do anything which can hurt the feelings of their Majesties. Unite their Flag with England‚Äôs, if it cannot, from the disposition of the Islanders, fly alone.\\" = The siege of Valletta = In February 1799, the Maltese insurgents, having lost hope in an intervention of King Ferdinand, requested that Ball, who had previously landed near the village of Qrendi on the south of the island, preside over the National Assembly. He changed the name of the assembly to that of National Congress and declared himself chief of government. In March, the Congress appealed to King George III to assume sovereignty over Malta, but no answer came from Pitt‚Äôs ministry. The starving French garrison received a little relief at the beginning of February 1799. The frigate La Boudeuse ran the blockade and entered the Grand Harbour. However, she was the last ship to re-supply Vaubois and his men. On 1 November 1799 Nelson was off Valletta on board the Foudroyant. Vaubois, who was still hoping for relief from France, summarily rejected a new surrender demand. Vaubois wrote: Mindful of being worthy of the respect of your country, as you are with our own, we are resolved to defend this fortress to the last. Nelson ordered Ball to take command of the Maltese forces - about 2,000 Maltese troops along with about 1,500 irregulars, unpaid, ill-equipped and half- starving. A hard pressed King Ferdinand agreed to confirm Ball as Governor of Malta. The whole Maltese population, running short of essential provisions, was living close to famine so that the siege was turning into a race of which side would starve first. The British and Maltese, together with a Neapolitan contingent of 1,200 men, got some relief in January 1800. However, General Vaubois waited in vain for supplies. French preparations had dragged on until Napoleon--now Premier Consul--appointed contre-amiral Jean-Baptiste Perr√©e to command a relief expedition. The squadron, comprising Le G√©n√©reux (one of the two survivors of the Battle of the Nile), three corvettes serving as armed storeships, and one armed storeship, all with some 3,000 men, arms, food and ammunition on board, sailed from Toulon-sur-Mer on 6 February 1800. The expedition ended in disaster. On the morning of 18 February English ships met the French squadron off Lampedusa island. Contre-amiral Perr√©e was killed at the start of the action and at 1.30 p.m. Le G√©n√©reux struck her colours. The rest of the French convoy returned to Toulon. On August 24, Vaubois dispatched the frigates La Diane and La Justice to run the blockade to France. The Success sighted them, with the Northumberland and the captured Le G√©n√©reux, now crewed by the British, giving chase. The British captured La Diane but La Justice escaped under cover of darkness. = Vaubois' surrender = The siege was nearing its end. The French garrison had eaten all the horses, the mules, the dogs, the cats and the rats of Valletta. Finally, on 4 September 1800, Vaubois sent an emissary under a flag of truce to the British commander Major- General Henry Pigot. The following day, Pigot and Captain George Martin, RN, negotiated terms of surrender with General Vaubois and contre-amiral Villeneuve. (Ironically the French excluded Captain Alexander Ball, as chief of the Maltese, from the negotiations, as the French did not want to surrender to the Maltese.) The British granted Vaubois and the French fair terms and the honors of war, including the right to keep their arms and spoils. General Vaubois and his troops were quickly repatriated to Marseilles. After Malta While the siege continued, Vaubois became a senator on 27 July 1800. He was named a Grand Officer of the Legion of Honor in 1804 and a Count of the Empire in 1808. In 1809 he led a division of the National Guard.Chandler, p 458 He became a peer of France and Knight of St. Louis in 1814. During the Hundred Days in 1815, Vaubois did not join Napoleon. He died in 1839. Sources * Chandler, David. Dictionary of the Napoleonic Wars. New York: Macmillan, 1979. Annuaire de la noblesse de France et des maisons souveraines de l'Europe. Paris.

The chime originally had nine bells, donated by Jennie McGraw. They first rang at the University's opening ceremonies on October 7, 1868, and have since marked the hours and been used for chiming concerts. The tower, long called \\"the Library Tower\\", was renamed in 1961.Uris Library celebrated by Martin B. Stiles, 'Cornell Chronicle', October 26, 1989 Whether the new name was intended to honor Jennie McGraw or her father, trustee John McGraw, was not specified at the time.\\"Ezra's Oracle\\". Cornell Daily Sun. October 19, 2013. The Cornell Chimes The bells are played by a group of \\"chimesmasters.\\" About ten chimesmasters play three concerts daily during the school year and a reduced schedule during the summer and semester breaks, making it one of the largest and most frequently played chimes in the world. The chimes are sometimes mistakenly called a \\"carillon\\" which is incorrect as a true carillon has at least 23 bells, and a different playing console. Many styles of music are played on the bells, including classical and modern pieces by a range of composers, including Beethoven, The Beatles, Franz Schubert, and Scott Joplin. Commonly played pieces include Edward Elgar's Pomp and Circumstance Marches and the theme from The Muppet Show, as well as a multitude of original compositions. The chimes' music library contains over two-thousand specially arranged pieces and original compositions‚Äîboth solos and duets. Every morning concert, since 1869, has begun with the \\"Cornell Changes\\" (affectionately known as the \\"Jennie McGraw Rag\\"). The chimesmasters' goal is to play its 549 notes as quickly as possible. The Cornell \\"Alma Mater\\" is played at the midday concert, and the \\"Cornell Evening Song\\" at the end of the evening concert. Each spring semester potential chimesmasters, \\"compets\\", undergo a rigorous ten-week competition to become a chimesmaster. The only requirement to compete is an ability to read music and the energy to climb the 161 steps to operate the playing clavier (there is no mechanical assistance). The first stage of competition requires that compets learn the three traditional Cornell pieces (the \\"Jenny McGraw Rag,\\" the \\"Alma Mater,\\" and the \\"Cornell Evening Song\\"). Compets play a practice instrument, where the levers strike tuned bars with hammers (like a xylophone), allowing them to learn the instrument without the whole campus listening. To advance to the next round of competition, compets must demonstrate their mastery of the three songs, in addition to sight reading a piece. This audition is played on the main chimes console, but compets only press the dampers halfway, and therefore the chimes remain silent. Those who pass the silent audition move on to coached concerts, and then, finally, judged concerts, where compets take on the full responsibilities of a chimesmaster. The Cornell Chimes welcome visitors to all concerts. McGraw Tower In 1873 the chimes were moved from a ground-level playing stand to McGraw Hall. In 1891, they were moved to their permanent home atop McGraw Tower, designed by Cornell alumnus William Henry Miller. The 173-foot (53 m) tower is Cornell's most prominent landmark and is adjacent to Uris Library. The tower is also home to an office, museum, practice room, and a restored 1875 Seth Thomas clock with a 14-foot pendulum. Visitors can still see the clockworks and pendulum, but the clock was linked to the Global Positioning System in 1999. Pranks On October 8, 1997, a pumpkin appeared atop the spire of McGraw Tower. How it was placed there is not publicly known. Because of the danger involved in retrieving it, administrators decided to leave it until it rotted and fell off. However, the pumpkin rapidly dried out in the cold air and remained on the tower until it was removed with a crane on March 13, 1998 (it was planned that Provost Don M. Randel would remove it, but in a practice run the crane basket was blown by a gust of wind and knocked the pumpkin off). Some people said a real pumpkin could not stay up that long without rotting and that it must be artificial.

She served as a member of the Mazhilis from 2004 to 2007, then again from 2012 to 2015. From 2014, Nazarbayeva was the Deputy Chair of Mazhilis until she became a Deputy Prime Minister, where served from 2015 until she became the member of the Senate in 2016. Served as the Chair of the Senate of Kazakhstan from 2019 to 2020. She is the daughter of former President of Kazakhstan Nursultan Nazarbayev. Early life and education Nazarbayeva was born at Temirtau in 1963. In 1980, she completed K. Satpayev Gymnasium No. 56 in Alma- Ata. From 1980 to 1983, she studied at the history department at Moscow State University. In 1985, she graduated from the S. M. Kirov Kazakh State University. In 1991, she defended her thesis for a candidate degree in historical sciences at the Moscow State University. In 1998, she defended her thesis for PhD degree in political sciences at the Russian Academy of State Service. Career = Khabar Agency = Dariga Nazarbayeva started her career in 1992, when she became the Vice-President of the Bobek Children‚Äôs Charity Fund established by her mother Sara Nazarbayeva. The Fund became the first organization in independent Kazakhstan to help children.}} In 1994, Dariga Nazarbayeva became the Vice-President of the Television and Radio of Kazakhstan Republican Corporation. In 1995, the Khabar TV channel was created based on the information service of Kazakh TV. Run by Dariga Nazarbayeva, Khabar managed to develop its own correspondent network, acquire the latest equipment and take a leading position among the country‚Äôs TV channels. In addition to Khabar, the organisations associated to Dariga Nazarbayeva purchased the Europa Plus Radio Station, KTK and NTK television companies and popular newspaper –°aravan. TV-Media and Alma-Media companies were established to manage the new media holding. In 1998, Khabar was transformed into a closed joint-stock company, and Nazarbayeva took the post of the President of the Company, and in 2001, the position of the Chairperson of the Board of Directors. In interviews, she often noted that she thought of the TV channel as \\"her child\\". In 1999, the first retro festival Alma-Ata is My First Love! under Nazarbayeva‚Äôs patronage took place at the Alatau Resort; the festival was organized by the Khabar Agency. The main idea of the festival was to preserve the spiritual connection between the generations of Almaty residents, support the status of Almaty as the cultural center of the country and reproduce the spiritual atmosphere and unique culture of the city of the 1960s-early 1980s. In June 2001, at the World Congress on Information Cooperation Information: The 21st Century Challenge, Nazarbayeva proposed to establish a permanent Eurasian Media Forum. She noted that the participants could discuss the issues of creating the Eurasian information space, the relations between the government and the media and the ethical standards of journalism. The first Eurasian Media Forum was held in April 2002 in Almaty; the President of Kazakhstan Nursultan Nazarbayev opened the Forum by delivering a welcome speech. In 2002, the first Congress of Journalists of Kazakhstan opened; on April 27, Nazarbayeva was elected as the Chairperson of the Executive Committee at the meeting of the initiative group of the Congress of Journalists of Kazakhstan. The Congress raised the issue of creating a code of ethics for journalists in the country for the first time. =First President‚Äôs Foundation= Since 2007, Nazarbayeva has been the Director of the Foundation of the First President of the Republic of Kazakhstan, engaged in public and charity activities, participated in international conferences and symposia. The Foundation operates in three main areas: 1) youth programs (help to unleash and realize the intellectual and creative potential of Kazakhstan's youth supporting their researches and projects and holding scientific and creative events); 2) social projects and charity; 3) an analytical center ‚Äì Institute of World Economics and Politics. =Social and charity activities= Since the late 1990s, Dariga Nazarbayeva has regularly appeared on the screens of Kazakh TV channels as a singer, given many charity concerts, including on the stage of the Bolshoi Theater in Moscow. Her repertoire includes Kazakh folk songs, Russian romances, opera arias and songs by Joe Dassin. According to Nazarbayeva, her voice was trained by a professional teacher of the Almaty Opera Nadiya Sharipova who brought up the famous tenor Alibek Dnishev. Nazarbayeva's first solo concert \\"But Still I Love\\" was held in Almaty in May 2001, all the proceeds from the concert went towards of veterans of the Great Patriotic War. A year later, in Almaty, a second solo concert, \\"Singing Again\\", took place. In the summer of 2003, by the invitation of the Ministry of Culture of Russia, she gave a recital in the Beethoven Hall at the Bolshoi Theater. In 2007, Nazarbayeva held a recital in Paris. In 2009, on behalf of and with the support of Nazarbayeva, the Asar-Bereke Public Fund implemented a project to provide qualified medical services to residents of Kazakhstan's regions, and thousands of specialists were trained for mobile medical complexes capable of working in emergency situations. Since 2019, the Asar- Bereke Public Foundation has been creating conditions for children with cancer by examining and treating them at the Nuclear Therapy Center in St. Petersburg. On 1 December 2011, Nazarbayeva gave a recital ‚ÄúSalem, Russia‚Äù in Moscow on the new stage in the Bolshoi Theater, and on 14 December in the Organ Hall of Astana. A Russian company Universal Music filmed her concert performances at various venues for the musical television movie My Star. The two-part film was presented in February 2012 in Almaty as part of the Together Against Cancer charity project, and in Moscow on 20 April 2012. In June 2012, on the initiative of the Degdar Foundation, the First International Festival of Arts Astana Keshteri (‚ÄúEvenings of Astana‚Äù) was held which was a charity project aimed at making high art as accessible as possible and giving all social groups the opportunity to join masterpieces of world music culture. Within the framework of the project, Nazarbayeva and Alibek Dnishev, Russian organist Rubin Abdullin, pianist Timur Urmancheev, conductor Renat Salavatov, young opera singers Medet Chotabaev and Andrey Tregubenko demonstrated their performance. Tickets for the concert were distributed for free. On 13 May 2013, she gave a concert, co-organized by Count Pierre Sheremetev, at the Th√©√¢tre des Champs-√âlys√©es in Paris, with the Orchestre Lamoureux directed by Dmitry Yablonsky and the Sazgen sazi group directed by Baghdat Tilegenov, and with some artists as the pianist Timur Urmancheev,88 notes pour piano solo, Jean-Pierre Thiollet, Neva Ed., 2015, p. 192.

Among the audience were Aleksandr Orlov, Ambassador of Russia to France, other ambassadors, diplomats or investors, and French writer Jean- Pierre Thiollet. =Offshore activities= 221B Baker Street, also known as the Sherlock Holmes Museum, is believed to be owned by Nazarbayeva On 21 June 2018, it was revealed by the Panama Papers that Nazarbayeva was the sole shareholder of an off-shore sugar company based in the British Virgin Islands which did business in Kazakhstan. Her son, Nurali, was also named in the papers as being a client of Mossack Fonseca in Panama, and having two companies and luxury yacht also registered in the British Virgin Islands. According to Newsweek, \\"this is a sharp contradiction from Nazarbayev‚Äôs frequent appeals to entrepreneurs in the oil-rich country to pay taxes in Kazakhstan.\\" The Panama Papers also suggest she may be the owner, through an off-shore company, of 221B Baker Street, the $183 million property famous as being the fictional address of Sherlock Holmes. On 10 March 2020, a British court announced the names of the owners of properties worth $100 million, which were issued an UWO in the spring of 2019. The owners turned out to be Nazarbayeva and her eldest son, Nurali Aliyev, with his wife Aida. The representative of the defendants at the hearing explained that the owners can confirm the source of the funds, since at that time they were engaged in business. In April, the High Court of Justice declared the claims by the British law enforcement agencies unfounded and as a result, the case was overturned.  Asar (2003‚Äì2006)  In October 2002, Dariga Nazarbayeva became the Chairperson of the Board of Trustees of the Choice of the Young People block; it was proposed to create the Congress of Youth of Kazakhstan at the first conference of the block. In October 2003, Nazarbayeva organized and became the leader of the Asar Republican Party. In a few months, more than 167,000 applications were collected from those wishing to join Asar; 139,000 applications were processed and authenticated, and 77,000 signatures were submitted to the Ministry of Justice for registration. In December 2003, the party was registered. According to the results of the elections to the Mazhilis in 2004, the party polled 541,239 (11.38 %) votes on a party list basis and ranked the third; Nazarbayeva became a member on the party list in the Mazhilis, and three members from the Asar were elected in single-member constituencies. On 4 July 2006, an extraordinary party convention was held where they decided to merge with the Otan Republican Political Party (Nur Otan since December 2006), and Dariga Nazarbayeva became the Deputy Chair of the Nur Otan.  Member of the Mazhilis (2004‚Äì2007, 2012‚Äì2015)  Nazarbayeva at the Mazhilis session, 11 November 2012In February 2005, a new Deputy Group of Aimak formed in the Parliament, consisting of 36 deputies (28 deputies from the Mazhilis and 8 deputies from the Senate). Nazarbayeva was elected as the group leader. The main goals of the Aimak Deputy Group were to promote and monitor the implementation of existing state and industry programs aimed at regional development, take an active part in the development and legislative support of administrative reform and local self-government and develop entrepreneurship. She remained as a member of the Mazhilis until it's dissolution on 20 June 2007. In the 2012 Kazakh legislative election, Nazarbayeva ran again in the Nur Otan party list which won 83 seats. She headed the Mazhilis Committee on Socio-Cultural Development. On 3 April 2014, Nazarbayeva was unanimously chosen as a Vice Chair of the Mazhilis and the parliamentary leader of Nur Otan. On 11 September 2015, she was appointed as a Deputy Prime Minister.

She succeeded Kassym-Jomart Tokayev in that role, who was appointed acting president of the country. According to The New York Times, this may have been a signal that Nazarbayeva was being groomed to become president herself. On 2 May 2020, she was removed from the Senate and her role as the Chair by President Tokayev. Many theories arose that either Tokayev was expanding his political influence or a sign of growing feud between the Kazakhstan's ruling elite.  Personal life  =Family= Nazarbayeva's former husband, Rakhat Aliyev in 2007 Nazarbayeva had a long marriage to Kazakh businessman and politician Rakhat Aliyev until their divorce in June 2007. Aliyev held senior posts in Kazakhstan's domestic intelligence agency and foreign ministry, and later as ambassador to Austria. In 2004, a woman alleged to be Aliyev's mistress was found dead, having fallen from a tall apartment building in Beirut. He was stripped of his titles in 2007 after critiquing President Nazarbayev for altering the nation's constitution to allow him to be president for life. Aliyev claimed that his divorce was executed without his consent, and that it was forced by Nazarbayev.Nazarbayev's Son-in-Law Is Divorced Moscow Times, June 13, 2007 Aliyev was convicted in absentia for various crimes in Kazakhstan. Austria refused to extradite him, but were preparing to try him for the kidnapping and murder of two Kazakh bank officials. Before the trial, he was founded dead in his Austrian jail cell due to alleged suicide.

Nazarbayeva made no responses regarding the case made by her son. The next day on 24 January, a female correspondent from the RFE/RL attempted to receive response from Nazarbayeva regarding her son's claims as she was walking by in the Parliament building hallway where one of Nazarbayeva's security guards ended up grabbing the reporter by the arm and covering her mouth. On 16 August 2020, Aisultan was found dead in London. The cause of his death was apparently due to cardiac arrest. In response to his death, Nazarbayeva stated \\"My family is devastated at the loss of our beloved Aisultan and we ask for privacy at this very difficult time.\\" =Wealth= According to Forbes Magazine in 2013 her wealth was about $595 million.

It drafted the Topeka Constitution that would have banned slavery in Kansas. The convention was organized by Free-Staters to counter the pro slavery Territorial legislature elected March 5, 1855 in polling suffering widely from electoral fraud and the intimidation of free state settlers. The Topeka Constitution marked the first effort to form a Kansas governmental structure and define its basis in law. Free-State delegates passed the constitution on December 15, 1855. The Territory-wide election for officers and approval of the constitution on January 15, 1856 was boycotted by most pro-slavery men. Among those elected was Charles L. Robinson as governor. The constitution was forwarded to Washington with a plea to the U.S. Congress for its acceptance. President Pierce condemned the document. It was presented in the Senate by Senator Lewis Cass of Michigan and in the House by Representative Daniel of Indiana. It passed the House by two votes on July 2, but was held in committee by the Senate. On July 8, Senator Stephen A. Douglas took up the Topeka Constitution in a bill counter to Senator Cass, which threw the issue back upon the people of Kansas in accordance with the provisions of the Kansas-Nebraska Act. With renewed determination, the Free State legislature reconvened in Topeka's Constitution Hall on January 5, 1858. Governor Robinson urged keeping the State government intact, and laws were passed. The Topeka Constitution was again sent to the Congress, but no action was taken. The South controlled Congress, and it was not going to admit Kansas as a free state if they could help it. It was not so much that slavery was benign, as most of them believed, it was that a new, free state would change the balance of power in the polarized Senate, and Southern leaders said that if slavery could not expand it would die. Three more state constitutions were later proposed: the pro- slavery Lecompton Constitution (1857) and the Free-State Leavenworth Constitution (1858,) before the Wyandotte Constitution (1859) ultimately led to Kansas being admitted into the Union as a free state in 1861. The Civil War began four months later. Citizens of the 2nd Territorial District petitioned the 1855 Free State convention to incorporate a black exclusion clause in the Topeka Constitution. This was rejected by officials including James H. Lane, convention president, who allowed the issue to be voted separately in the January 1856 elections; the results favored exclusion. An outcome would have been prevention of resident free African Americans, as well as the characteristic dangers created by frontier bounty hunters. The conflict by separate Free State and Territorial legislatures, each seeking control of Kansas' destiny, was carried out with guns and the ballot box. These conditions and surrounding national implications inspired the term Bleeding Kansas. Following the Free State elections, in a lengthy address on January 24, 1856, President Franklin Pierce proclaimed the Topeka government to be revolutionary and ordered the arrest of its leaders: Despite this proclamation, the Topeka Legislature convened on March 4, 1856 and again on the Fourth of July to ask the Congress for admittance of the state. The legislature was dispersed on July 4, 1856 by three squadrons of federal troops under the command of Colonel Edwin Vose Sumner. Sumner later called this the most painful duty of his career. Never before had a body of U.S. citizens, meeting to regain their voting rights, been broken up by federal forces. References * Cutler, William G. (1883). \\"History of the State of Kansas\\".

It is often used when a member of the meeting seeks to reach clarity on how to respond to a concern or dilemma. Like Quaker business meetings, meetings of clearness committees are considered a form of meeting for worship and are based on the principle that the inner light is present in all people. The process thus is one of aiding the person seeking clearness in finding the answer within, rather than offering outside advice or guidance. A clearness committee can be requested by anyone for any reason and will usually be appointed by one of the standing committees of a Monthly Meeting. In addition to those requested by individuals, clearness committees are appointed by most meetings when a person applies for membership and when a couple seeks marriage under the care of the meeting. In these cases, the committee serves the dual purpose of helping the person or couple find clearness that this is the proper step and ensuring that the meeting is ready to take the member or couple under their care. Clearness committees were frequently used by the Quaker-influenced Movement for a New Society and occasionally show up in other progressive organizations in the Philadelphia area, especially those with pacifist or nonviolence orientations.

Ruoholahti highlighted The Ruoholahti canal Ruoholahti district viewed from the north Kaapelitehdas (Cable Factory) culture centre Ruoholahti (Swedish: Gr√§sviken) is a quarter in Helsinki, part of the L√§nsisatama neighbourhood and Kampinmalmi district. The name means Grass Bay and is pronounced . Ruoholahti is located in the southwestern part of the central city area of Helsinki, close to the Lauttasaari island, and it functions as the principal connection between the Helsinki city centre and the city of Espoo to the west. Ruoholahti is inhabited by approx. 3300 people.http://www.hel2.fi/tietokeskus/helsinki_alueittain_2005/103Kampinmalmi.pdf Information about Kampinmalmi and its subareas The L√§nsisatama port is also situated in Ruoholahti. History The Ruoholahti area was created in the 1910s by connecting several small islands with earth fill. Its purpose was to accommodate the above-mentioned port. In the 1940s there also developed a small industrial district whose most notable buildings were the cable factory (Kaapelitehdas) of Nokia (which later became a cultural centre when Nokia gave up cable manufacturing and moved on to telecommunications), the headquarters of the Finnish government-owned alcohol enterprise Alko (transformed in 2002 into the Ruoholahti shopping centre), and the legendary Lepakko or Lepakkoluola (Bat cave), an old warehouse building used in 1967-1979 as emergency accommodation for homeless alcoholics and then, from 1979 to 1999 as an independent centre of youth culture from 1979 to 1999 (it was demolished to make way for an office building). In the 1960s the L√§nsiv√§yl√§ highway was built through Ruoholahti to connect Helsinki to southern Espoo. A planning competition for the future of the area had been held in the middle 1980s. The area started changing significantly in 1991 when the construction of a new residential and office area began. The most striking of the office buildings was the High Tech Centre (HTC), designed by architect Kai Wartiainen and completed in 2001. The Helsinki Metro was extended to Ruoholahti in 1993. A short canal was built through the area to reinforce the image of a maritime district. Nokia returned to the area in 1999, when a new research centre was opened, designed by architect Tuomo Siitonen. Future As a part of the Kampinmalmi area and for its great location near the Helsinki city center, Ruoholahti is a vivid and easy area to live and work. There are lot of parks and kindergartens, so the area is very popular among the families. Ruoholahti has its own school: Ruoholahden Ala-aste which is now facing a positive challenge to fulfil the needs of its expanding neighbourhood J√§tk√§saari. J√§tk√§saari got its own school in autumn 2017 - first it only served first and second graders, but in 2019 there was a promise of J√§tk√§saari primary and secondary school. Ruoholahti now competes with J√§tk√§saari area and there are many everyday services, shops, restaurants, coffee shops and one can participate in sports, study music in Ruoholahden Konservatorio or explore arts in Kaapelitehdas. Ruoholahti-J√§tk√§saari has its own choir, own football teams (operated by PPJ) and many local activities. Ruoholahti and J√§tk√§saari area is an optimal area to live for people in all ages.

Chryse Planitia lies partially in the Lunae Palus quadrangle, partially in the Oxia Palus quadrangle, partially in the Mare Acidalium quadrangle. It is 1600 km or 994 mi in diameter and with a floor 2.5 km below the average planetary surface altitude, and is thought to be an ancient impact basin; it has several features in common with lunar maria, such as wrinkle ridges. The density of impact craters in the range is close to half the average for lunar maria. Chryse Planitia shows evidence of water erosion in the past, and is the bottom end for many outflow channels from the southern highlands as well as from Valles Marineris and the flanks of the Tharsis bulge. It is one of the lowest regions on Mars ( below the mean surface elevation of Mars), so water would tend to flow into it. The elevation generally goes down from the Tharsis Ridge to Chryse. Kasei Valles, Maja Valles, and Nanedi Valles appear to run from high areas (Tharsis Ridge) to Chryse Planitia. On the other side of Chryse, to the east, the land gets higher. Ares Vallis travels from this high region, then empties into Chryse. Much of Tiu Valles and Simud Valles move toward Chryse as well.Victor R.

It would be quite spectacular to walk down this valley. It has been theorized that the Chryse basin may have contained a large lake or an ocean during the Hesperian or early Amazonian periods since all of the large outflow channels entering it end at the same elevation, at which some surface features suggest an ancient shoreline may be present. Chryse basin opens into the North Polar Basin, so if an ocean was present Chryse would have been a large bay. The Viking 1 landed in Chryse Planitia, but its landing site was not near the outflow channels and no fluvial features were visible; the terrain at that point appeared primarily volcanic in origin. The Mars Pathfinder landed in Ares Vallis, at the end of one of the outflow channels emptying into Chryse.

Vignetting is a common feature of photographs produced by toy cameras such as this shot taken with a Holga. This example shows both vignetting and restricted field of view (FOV). Here a \\"point-and-shoot camera\\" is used together with a microscope to create this image. Pronounced vignetting (fall off in brightness towards the edge) is visible as the optical system is not well adapted. A further circular restriction of the FOV is visible (the black area in the image). In photography and optics, vignetting (; ) is a reduction of an image's brightness or saturation toward the periphery compared to the image center. The word vignette, from the same root as vine, originally referred to a decorative border in a book. Later, the word came to be used for a photographic portrait that is clear at the center and fades off toward the edges. A similar effect is visible in photographs of projected images or videos off a projection screen, resulting in a so-called \\"hotspot\\" effect. Vignetting is often an unintended and undesired effect caused by camera settings or lens limitations. However, it is sometimes deliberately introduced for creative effect, such as to draw attention to the center of the frame. A photographer may deliberately choose a lens that is known to produce vignetting to obtain the effect, or it may be introduced with the use of special filters or post-processing procedures. When using superzoom lenses, vignetting may occur all along the zoom range, depending on the aperture and the focal length. However, it may not always be visible, except at the widest end (the shortest focal length). In these cases, vignetting may cause an exposure value (EV) difference of up to 0.75EV. Causes There are several causes of vignetting. Sidney F. RaySidney F. Ray, Applied photographic optics, 3rd ed., Focal Press (2002) . distinguishes the following types: * Mechanical vignetting * Optical vignetting * Natural vignetting A fourth cause is unique to digital imaging: * Pixel vignetting A fifth cause is unique to analog imaging: * Photographic film vignetting =Mechanical vignetting= Mechanical vignetting occurs when light beams emanating from object points located off- axis are partially blocked by external objects such as thick or stacked filters, secondary lenses, and improper lens hoods. This has the effect of changing the entrance pupil shape as a function of angle (resulting in the path of light being partially blocked). Darkening can be gradual or abrupt ‚Äì the smaller the aperture, the more abrupt the vignetting as a function of angle. When some points on an image receives no light at all due to mechanical vignetting (the paths of light to these image points is completely blocked), then this results in a restriction of the field of view (FOV) ‚Äì parts of the image are then completely black. =Optical vignetting= This type of vignetting is caused by the physical dimensions of a multiple element lens. Rear elements are shaded by elements in front of them, which reduces the effective lens opening for off-axis incident light. The result is a gradual decrease in light intensity towards the image periphery. Optical vignetting is sensitive to the lens aperture and can often be cured by a reduction in aperture of 2‚Äì3 stops. (An increase in the F-number.) =Natural vignetting= Unlike the previous types, natural vignetting (also known as natural illumination falloff) is not due to the blocking of light rays. The falloff is approximated by the cos4 or \\"cosine fourth\\" law of illumination falloff. Here, the light falloff is proportional to the fourth power of the cosine of the angle at which the light impinges on the film or sensor array. Wideangle rangefinder designs and the lens designs used in compact cameras are particularly prone to natural vignetting. Telephoto lenses, retrofocus wideangle lenses used on SLR cameras, and telecentric designs in general are less troubled by natural vignetting. A gradual grey filter or postprocessing techniques may be used to compensate for natural vignetting, as it cannot be cured by stopping down the lens. Some modern lenses are specifically designed so that the light strikes the image parallel or nearly so, eliminating or greatly reducing vignetting. = Pixel vignetting = Pixel vignetting only affects digital cameras and is caused by angle-dependence of the digital sensors. Light incident on the sensor at normal incident produces a stronger signal than light hitting it at an oblique angle. Most digital cameras use built-in image processing to compensate for optical vignetting and pixel vignetting when converting raw sensor data to standard image formats such as JPEG or TIFF. The use of offset microlenses over the image sensor can also reduce the effect of pixel vignetting. Vignetting can be used to artistic effect, as demonstrated in this panorama. Vignetting can be applied in the post-shoot phase with digital imaging software.  Post-shoot  For artistic effect, vignetting is sometimes applied to an otherwise un-vignetted photograph and can be achieved by burning the outer edges of the photograph (with film stock) or using digital imaging techniques, such as masking darkened edges. The Lens Correction filter in Photoshop can also achieve the same effect. In digital imaging, this technique is used to create a low fidelity (photography) appearance in the picture.

It is one of the estrogens present in the estrogen mixtures known as conjugated estrogens (CEEs; brand name Premarin) and esterified estrogens (EEs; Estratab, Menest). CEEs is the most commonly used form of estrogen in hormone replacement therapy (HRT) for menopausal symptoms in the United States. Estrone sulfate is the major estrogen in CEEs (about 50%) while equilin sulfate is the second major estrogen in the formulation, present as about 25% of the total. Pharmacology =Pharmacodynamics= Equilin is an estrogen, or an agonist of the estrogen receptors (ERs), the ERŒ± and ERŒ≤. In terms of relative binding affinity for the ERs, equilin has about 13% and 49% of that of estradiol for the ERŒ± and ERŒ≤, respectively. Analogously to the reversible transformation of estrone into estradiol by 17Œ≤-hydroxysteroid dehydrogenase, equilin can be converted into the more potent estrogen 17Œ≤-dihydroequilin in the body. This estrogen has about 113% and 108% of the relative binding affinities of estradiol for the ERŒ± and ERŒ≤, respectively. Equilin is present in CEEs in the form of equilin sulfate, which itself is inactive and acts as a prodrug of equilin via steroid sulfatase. Similarly to synthetic estrogens like ethinylestradiol, equilin and CEEs have disproportionate effects in certain tissues such as the liver and uterus relative to bioidentical human estrogens like estradiol and estrone. Because of their disproportionate potency in the liver, equilin and CEEs have relatively increased effects on liver protein synthesis compared to estradiol. A dosage of 0.25 mg/day equilin sulfate is equivalent to 0.625 mg/day CEEs in terms of relief from hot flashes. At a dosage of 0.625 mg/day equilin sulfate, the increases in circulating levels of sex hormone-binding globulin (SHBG), corticosteroid-binding globulin, and angiotensinogen were 1.5 to 8 times those observed with estrone sulfate. Equilin has about 42% of the relative potency of CEEs in the vagina and 80% of the relative potency of CEEs in the uterus, while its more active form, 17Œ≤-dihydroequilin, has about 83% of the relative potency of CEEs in the vagina and 200% of the relative potency of CEEs in the uterus. =Pharmacokinetics= Equilin has about 8% of the relative binding affinity of testosterone for SHBG, relative to 12% in the case of estrone. In terms of plasma protein binding, it is bound 26% to SHBG and 13% to albumin. The metabolic clearance rates of equilin and equilin sulfate are 2,640 L/day/m2 and 175 L/day/m2, respectively. In accordance, the biological half- life of equilin sulfate is substantially longer than that of equilin. Equilin is converted into 17Œ≤-dihydroequilin in the liver and in other tissues. Equilin and 17Œ≤-dihydroequilin can also be transformed into equilenin and 17Œ≤-dihydroequilenin. Equilin is excreted in the form of glucuronide conjugates. Chemistry Equilin, also known as Œ¥7-estrone or as 7-dehydroestrone, as well as estra-1,3,5(10),7-tetraen-3-ol-17-one, is a naturally occurring estrane steroid and an analogue of estrone. In terms of chemical structure and pharmacology, equilin is to 17Œ≤-dihydroequilin (Œ¥7-17Œ≤-estradiol) as estrone is to estradiol.

The waters within Greater Farallones National Marine Sanctuary are part of a nationally significant marine ecosystem, and support an abundance of life, including many threatened or endangered species. About In 1972, in response to a growing awareness of the value of our coastal waters, Congress passed the National Marine Sanctuaries Act. The Act authorized the designation of National Marine Sanctuaries to protect significant waters and secure habitat for aquatic species, shelter historically significant shipwrecks and other cultural resources, and serve as valuable spots for research, fishing, wildlife viewing, boating, and tourism. Designated in 1981, Gulf of the Farallones National Marine Sanctuary (GFNMS) spanned 1,279-square-miles (966 square nautical miles) just north and west of San Francisco Bay, and protected open ocean, nearshore tidal flats, rocky intertidal areas, estuarine wetlands, subtidal reefs, and coastal beaches within its boundaries. In 2015, GFNMSexpanded north and west of their original boundaries to encompass 3,295 square miles, and changed their name to Greater Farallones National Marine Sanctuary. GFNMS has administrative jurisdiction over the northern portion of the Monterey Bay National Marine Sanctuary, from the San Mateo/Santa Cruz County line northward to the existing boundary between the two sanctuaries. GFNMS maintains an administrative office and public Visitor Center on Crissy Field in the Presidio of San Francisco. GFNMS is located within the California Current ecosystem, one of four major eastern boundary currents in the world, that stretches along the western coast of North America from southern Canada to northern Mexico. Due to a high degree of wind-driven upwelling, there is a ready supply of nutrients to surface waters and the California Current ecosystem is one of the most biologically productive regions in the world. GFNMS is a globally significant, extraordinarily diverse, and productive marine ecosystem that supports abundant wildlife and valuable fisheries. It provides breeding and feeding grounds for at least twenty-five endangered or threatened species; thirty-six marine mammal species, including blue, gray, and humpback whales, harbor seals, elephant seals, Pacific white-sided dolphins, and one of the southernmost U.S. populations of threatened Steller sea lions; over a quarter- million breeding seabirds; and one of the most significant white shark populations on the planet. GFNMS adjoins two other National Marine Sanctuaries, Monterey Bay National Marine Sanctuary and Cordell Bank National Marine Sanctuary. It comprises part of the United Nations' Golden Gate Biosphere Reserve. Within the sanctuary are the Farallon Islands and associated National Wildlife Refuge.

The brainchild of Jeff Weber and Aaron Edsinger, cofounders of Meka Robotics, its name comes from the Japanese phrase for \\"thank you very much\\", domo arigato, as well as the Styx song, \\"Mr. Roboto\\". The Domo project was originally funded by NASA, and has now been joined by Toyota in funding robot's development. Purpose Domo was created to test many robotic circuits and commands that are very complex. Origin The home of the Domo Project is with the Humanoid Robotics Group (HRG) at MIT Artificial Intelligence (AI) Labs. Its existence is inspired by the robot projects that came before it. The Cardea Robot Project was a research project led by Professor Rodney Brooks in the Humanoid Robotics Group at MIT. The lab group worked to create a cable-drive brushless Series Elastic Actuator arm mounted to a Segway platform. Jeff Weber and Aaron Edsinger-Gonzales were a part of this research, specifically responsible for the design and implementation of the robotic arm. This collaboration allowed Edsinger-Gonzales and Weber to take some of the research and apply it to a new robot, Domo. Edsinger and Weber collaborated on many other robots as well, and their experience working with the Kismet page and Cog projects influenced the design of Domo. Kismet was a robotic head developed by Cynthia Breazeal for experimenting with social expressions and cues. Edsinger's role in the project was helping to develop the early stages of Kismet's eye detection module, which allowed Kismet to make eye contact while interacting. The Cog project was intended to explore the way that intelligence is formed through social interaction. The Cog robot was designed to emulate the human body's motor points and limbs and to accept input stimuli from these so that it could use its limbs in a human-like way. Edsinger's contribution to the Cog project was a Series Elastic Actuator arm and controllers for the body of the robot. Though the research direction of these robots is very different from the Domo Project, the design of the eye detection module and the Series Elastic Actuator arm are integrated into Domo's design. Design Domo was created in order to research manipulation and interaction with stimuli and machine learning of sensorimotor skills. To accomplish this, the design was required to have particular consideration as to how the robot would be able to interact with unfamiliar stimuli. The research also required Domo to be able to perceive and act upon its surroundings. Satisfying these concerns meant that Domo needed to be able to function without a complete model of the world, rather, it was equipped with the ability to build a model for itself. =Mechanical parts= Head Domo's robotic head consists of seven degrees of freedom (DOF) for the upper head which is attached to a neck with two DOF. There are two eyes, each with a single wide-angle camera. The cameras are capable of video capture at either 640√ó480 at 30 frames per second (frame/s) or 1024√ó768 at 15 frame/s. The two cameras tilt along the same DOF, but have individual DOF to allow for independent panning. A set of eyelids is included to use for expressions. Heads of previous robots, such as Cog, were impeded by the bundle of electrical cords that would run to the eye cameras and motors. Domo's design runs all the cables down through the neck so that they are tucked out of the way. This allows Domo a great deal of range and freedom in head articulation. The head movement is facilitated by brushed direct-current motors. Potentiometer position sensors in the motor provide feedback as to the head's absolute position at startup, so Domo does not require a calibration routine before being able to function. The main focus of the head design was for Domo to be able to emulate human eye movement. Human eye movements range from very quick and explosive movements to slow and accurate movements for following moving stimuli, so careful consideration was needed to design Domo's head and vision system. These eyes are linked to a cognitive system that is a networked cluster of Linux machines. The YARP software suite is utilized for the cognitive system to do visual processing. Arms Rather than designing Domo's arms for absolute precision, Edsinger and Weber designed the arms to work more closely to that of a human. Human arms are adept at sensing and controlling the forces at every joint, giving up precision in position for compliance. Translating this to a humanoid robot required the design to include some tolerance and compliance at every joint while also being able to keep track of and output torque. Domo's arms have six DOF, two at the shoulder and four in the arm and wrist. The joints are Series elastic actuators (SEA) driven by custom brushless DC motors. The DOFs contain cable drive systems, with the drive cables hidden discreetly in the center of the joints to not impede movement. Series elastic actuators are used to provide force-sensing capabilities to the arms. The sensors embedded throughout the arms are linked up to the cognitive system. Hands The design of a humanoid hand is required to incorporate some way to measure and output force. A few older designs had force sensors in the fingertips. While this would work in a known environment, it does not provide enough feedback to work in a novel and unknown environment. The controllers in Domo's hands are able to sense forces at the individual joints. This allows the hands to execute a grasp of an object even without a model of the object's size, shape or material. Each hand consists of three fingers powered by four actuators. There is one actuator for each finger and the fourth is to control the spread between two of the fingers. The two fingers are spread using gears, while the third remains in place. Abilities Domo will adapt to its surroundings by testing the physical nature of things by touching them or shaking them. Its abilities include determining the volume of an item, placing items on shelves, pouring drinks for humans, shaking hands, and giving hugs. =Perception= Using the two cameras mounted on its head and the visual processing system, Domo is able to analyze the size and shape of an object to prepare for interaction. This is done without prior knowledge about an object and allows Domo to accomplish tasks in unknown environments. =Learning= Domo's architecture allows for the robot to remember previous sensory experiences. Domo is able to learn about its own sensorimotor abilities and is able to fine-tune the modulation of its actions based on previously accomplished tasks. =Manipulation= Domo's hands were designed to be dexterous and capable of many different grasps and movements. However, this cannot be accomplished without the design of the software system to be adept at managing different controllers for each of its joints. This allows the robot to be able to react quickly and change its arm activity. This is critical for the robot to be able to attempt to perform real world tasks.

Unbibium and Ubb are the temporary systematic IUPAC name and symbol respectively, which are used until the element is discovered, confirmed, and a permanent name is decided upon. In the periodic table of the elements, it is expected to follow unbiunium as the second element of the superactinides and the fourth element of the 8th period. Similarly to unbiunium, it is expected to fall within the range of the island of stability, potentially conferring additional stability on some isotopes, especially 306Ubb which is expected to have a magic number of neutrons (184). Despite several attempts, unbibium has not yet been synthesized, nor have any naturally occurring isotopes been found to exist. There are currently no plans to attempt to synthesize unbibium. In 2008, it was claimed to have been discovered in natural thorium samples, but that claim has now been dismissed by recent repetitions of the experiment using more accurate techniques. Chemically, unbibium is expected to show some resemblance to its lighter congeners cerium and thorium. However, relativistic effects may cause some of its properties to differ; for example, it is expected to have a ground state electron configuration of [Og] 7d1 8s2 8p1, despite its predicted position in the g-block superactinide series. History =Synthesis attempts= Fusion-evaporation The first attempts to synthesize unbibium were performed in 1972 by Flerov et al. at the Joint Institute for Nuclear Research (JINR), using the heavy-ion induced hot fusion reactions: : + ‚Üí * ‚Üí no atoms These experiments were motivated by early predictions on the existence of an island of stability at N = 184 and Z > 120\\\\. No atoms were detected and a yield limit of 5 nb (5,000 pb) was measured. Current results (see flerovium) have shown that the sensitivity of these experiments were too low by at least 3 orders of magnitude. In 2000, the Gesellschaft f√ºr Schwerionenforschung (GSI) Helmholtz Center for Heavy Ion Research performed a very similar experiment with much higher sensitivity: : + ‚Üí * ‚Üí no atoms These results indicate that the synthesis of such heavier elements remains a significant challenge and further improvements of beam intensity and experimental efficiency is required. The sensitivity should be increased to 1 fb in the future for more quality results. Another unsuccessful attempt to synthesize unbibium was carried out in 1978 at the GSI Helmholtz Center, where a natural erbium target was bombarded with xenon-136 ions: : + ‚Üí * ‚Üí no atoms In particular, the reaction between 170Er and 136Xe was expected to yield alpha emitters with half-lives of microseconds that would decay down to isotopes of flerovium with half-lives perhaps increasing up to several hours, as flerovium is predicted to lie near the center of the island of stability. After twelve hours of irradiation, nothing was found in this reaction. Following a similar unsuccessful attempt to synthesize unbiunium from 238U and 65Cu, it was concluded that half-lives of superheavy nuclei must be less than one microsecond or the cross sections are very small. More recent research into synthesis of superheavy elements suggests that both conclusions are true. The two attempts in the 1970s to synthesize unbibium were both propelled by the research investigating whether superheavy elements could potentially be naturally occurring. Compound nucleus fission Several experiments studying the fission characteristics of various superheavy compound nuclei such as 306Ubb were performed between 2000‚Äì2004 at the Flerov Laboratory of Nuclear Reactions. Two nuclear reactions were used, namely 248Cm + 58Fe and 242Pu + 64Ni. The results reveal how superheavy nuclei fission predominantly by expelling closed shell nuclei such as 132Sn (Z = 50, N = 82). It was also found that the yield for the fusion-fission pathway was similar between 48Ca and 58Fe projectiles, suggesting a possible future use of 58Fe projectiles in superheavy element formation.see Flerov lab annual reports 2000‚Äì2004 inclusive http://www1.jinr.ru/Reports/Reports_eng_arh.html Future drip line around Z = 130\\\\. The white ring denotes the expected location of the island of stability; the two squares outlined in white denote 291Cn and 293Cn, predicted to be the longest-lived nuclides on the island with half-lives of centuries or millennia. Every element from mendelevium onward was produced in fusion- evaporation reactions, culminating in the discovery of the heaviest known element oganesson in 2002 and most recently tennessine in 2010. These reactions approached the limit of current technology; for example, the synthesis of tennessine required 22 milligrams of 249Bk and an intense 48Ca beam for six months. The intensity of beams in superheavy element research cannot exceed 1012 projectiles per second without damaging the target and detector, and producing larger quantities of increasingly rare and unstable actinide targets is impractical. Consequently, future experiments must be done at facilities such as the under-construction superheavy element factory (SHE- factory) at the Joint Institute for Nuclear Research (JINR) or RIKEN, which will allow experiments to run for longer stretches of time with increased detection capabilities and enable otherwise inaccessible reactions. It is possible that fusion-evaporation reactions will not be suitable for the discovery of unbibium or heavier elements. Various models predict increasingly short alpha and spontaneous fission half-lives for isotopes with Z = 122 and N ~ 180 on the order of microseconds or less, rendering detection nearly impossible with current equipment. The increasing dominance of spontaneous fission also may sever possible ties to known nuclei of livermorium or oganesson and make identification and confirmation more difficult; a similar problem occurred in the road to confirmation of the decay chain of 294Og which has no anchor to known nuclei. For these reasons, other methods of production may need to be researched such as multi-nucleon transfer reactions capable of populating longer-lived nuclei. A similar switch in experimental technique occurred when hot fusion using 48Ca projectiles was used instead of cold fusion (in which cross sections decrease rapidly with increasing atomic number) to populate elements with Z > 113. Nevertheless, several fusion- evaporation reactions leading to unbibium have been proposed in addition to those already tried unsuccessfully, though no institution has immediate plans to make synthesis attempts, instead focusing first on elements 119, 120, and possibly 121. Because cross sections increase with asymmetry of the reaction, a chromium beam would be most favorable in combination with a californium target, especially if the predicted closed neutron shell at N = 184 could be reached in more neutron-rich products and confer additional stability. In particular, the reaction between 54Cr and 252Cf would generate the compound nucleus 306Ubb* and reach the shell at N = 184, though the analogous reaction with a 249Cf target is believed to be more feasible because of the presence of unwanted fission products from 252Cf and difficulty in accumulating the required amount of target material. One possible synthesis of unbibium could occur as follows: : + ‚Üí + 3 Should this reaction be successful and alpha decay remain dominant over spontaneous fission, the resultant 300Ubb would decay through 296Ubn which may be populated in cross-bombardment between 249Cf and 50Ti. Although this reaction is one of the most promising options for the synthesis of unbibium in the near future, the maximum cross section is predicted to be 3 fb, one order of magnitude lower than the lowest measured cross section in a successful reaction. The more symmetrical reactions 244Pu + 64Ni and 248Cm + 58Fe have also been proposed and may produce more neutron- rich isotopes. With increasing atomic number, one must also be aware of decreasing fission barrier heights, resulting in lower survival probability of compound nuclei, especially above the predicted magic numbers at Z = 126 and N = 184. =Claimed discovery as a naturally occurring element= In 2008, a group led by Israeli physicist Amnon Marinov at the Hebrew University of Jerusalem claimed to have found single atoms of unbibium-292 in naturally occurring thorium deposits at an abundance of between 10‚àí11 and 10‚àí12 relative to thorium. This was the first time in 69 years that a new element had been claimed to be discovered in nature, after Marguerite Perey's 1939 discovery of francium. The claim of Marinov et al. was criticized by a part of the scientific community, and Marinov says he has submitted the article to the journals Nature and Nature Physics but both turned it down without sending it for peer review.Royal Society of Chemistry, \\"Heaviest element claim criticised\\", Chemical World. The unbibium-292 atoms were claimed to be superdeformed or hyperdeformed isomers, with a half-life of at least 100 million years. A criticism of the technique, previously used in purportedly identifying lighter thorium isotopes by mass spectrometry, was published in Physical Review C in 2008. A rebuttal by the Marinov group was published in Physical Review C after the published comment. A repeat of the thorium experiment using the superior method of accelerator mass spectrometry (AMS) failed to confirm the results, despite a 100-fold better sensitivity. This result throws considerable doubt on the results of the Marinov collaboration with regards to their claims of long-lived isotopes of thorium, roentgenium, and unbibium. It is still possible that traces of unbibium might exist in some thorium samples, though given current understanding of superheavy elements, this is very unlikely. =Naming= Using Mendeleev's nomenclature for unnamed and undiscovered elements, unbibium should instead be known as eka-thorium. After the recommendations of the IUPAC in 1979, the element has since been largely referred to as unbibium with the atomic symbol of (Ubb), as its temporary name until the element is officially discovered and synthesized, and a permanent name is decided on. Scientists largely ignore this naming convention, and instead simply refer to unbibium as \\"element 122\\" with the symbol of (122), or sometimes even E122 or 122. Predicted properties =Nuclear stability and isotopes= element 121; this poses difficulties in identifying heavier elements such as unbibium. The elliptical region encloses the predicted location of the island of stability. The stability of nuclei decreases greatly with the increase in atomic number after plutonium, the heaviest primordial element, so that all isotopes with an atomic number above 101 decay radioactively with a half-life under a day, with an exception of dubnium-268. No elements with atomic numbers above 82 (after lead) have stable isotopes. Nevertheless, because of reasons not very well understood yet, there is a slight increased nuclear stability around atomic numbers 110‚Äì114, which leads to the appearance of what is known in nuclear physics as the \\"island of stability\\". This concept, proposed by University of California professor Glenn Seaborg, explains why superheavy elements last longer than predicted. In this region of the periodic table, N = 184 has been suggested as a closed neutron shell, and various atomic numbers have been proposed as closed proton shells, such as Z = 114, 120, 122, 124, and 126. The island of stability would be characterized by longer half-lives of nuclei located near these magic numbers, though the extent of stabilizing effects is uncertain due to predictions of weakening of the proton shell closures and possible loss of double magicity. More recent research predicts the island of stability to instead be centered at beta-stable copernicium isotopes 291Cn and 293Cn, which would place unbibium well above the island and result in short half-lives regardless of shell effects. The increased stability of elements 112‚Äì118 has also been attributed to the oblate shape of such nuclei and resistance to spontaneous fission. The same model also proposes 306Ubb as the next spherical doubly magic nucleus, thus defining the true island of stability for spherical nuclei. Regions of differently shaped nuclei, as predicted by the Interacting Boson Approximation A quantum tunneling model predicts the alpha-decay half- lives of unbibium isotopes 284‚Äì322Ubb to be on the order of microseconds or less for all isotopes lighter than 315Ubb, highlighting a significant challenge in experimental observation of this element. This is consistent with many predictions, though the exact location of the 1 microsecond border varies by model. Additionally, spontaneous fission is expected to become a major decay mode in this region, with half-lives on the order of femtoseconds predicted for some even‚Äìeven isotopes due to minimal hindrance resulting from nucleon pairing and loss of stabilizing effects farther away from magic numbers. A 2016 calculation on the half-lives and probable decay chains of isotopes 280‚Äì339Ubb yields corroborating results: 280‚Äì297Ubb will be proton unbound and possibly decay by proton emission, 298‚Äì314Ubb will have alpha half-lives on the order of microseconds, and those heavier than 314Ubb will predominantly decay by spontaneous fission with short half-lives. For the lighter alpha emitters that may be populated in fusion-evaporation reactions, some long decay chains leading down to known or reachable isotopes of lighter elements are predicted. Additionally, the isotopes 308‚Äì310Ubb are predicted to have half-lives under 1 microsecond, too short for detection as a result of significantly lower binding energy for neutron numbers immediately above the N = 184 shell closure. Alternatively, a second island of stability with total half-lives of approximately 1 second may exist around Z ~ 124 and N ~ 198, though these nuclei will be difficult or impossible to reach using current experimental techniques. However, these predictions are strongly dependent on the chosen nuclear mass models, and it is unknown which isotopes of unbibium will be most stable. Regardless, these nuclei will be hard to synthesize as no combination of obtainable target and projectile can provide enough neutrons in the compound nucleus. Even for nuclei reachable in fusion reactions, spontaneous fission and possibly also cluster decay might have significant branches, posing another hurdle to identification of superheavy elements as they are normally identified by their successive alpha decays. =Chemical= Unbibium is predicted to be a heavier congener of cerium and thorium and thus to have a similar chemistry to them, although it may be more reactive. Additionally, unbibium is predicted to belong to a new block of valence g-electron atoms, although the g-block's position left of the f-block is speculative and the 5g orbital is not expected to start filling until element 125. The predicted ground-state electron configuration of unbibium is [Og] 7d1 8s2 8p1, in contrast to the expected [Og] 5g2 8s2 in which the 5g orbital starts filling at element 121. In the superactinides, relativistic effects might cause a breakdown of the Aufbau principle and create overlapping of the 5g, 6f, 7d and 8p orbitals; experiments on the chemistry of copernicium and flerovium provide strong indications of the increasing role of relativistic effects. As such, the chemistry of elements following unbibium becomes more difficult to predict. Unbibium would most likely form a dioxide, UbbO2, and tetrahalides, such as UbbF4 and UbbCl4. The main oxidation state is predicted to be IV, similar to cerium and thorium. A first ionization energy of 5.651 eV and second ionization energy of 11.332 eV are predicted for unbibium; this and other calculated ionization energies are lower than the analogous values for thorium, suggesting that the trend of increasing reactivity down the group may indeed continue.

It acts to transport monoamine neurotransmitters ‚Äì such as dopamine, serotonin, norepinephrine, epinephrine, and histamine ‚Äì into the vesicles, which release the neurotransmitters into synapses as chemical messages to postsynaptic neurons. VMATs utilize a proton gradient generated by V-ATPases in vesicle membranes to power monoamine import. Pharmaceutical drugs that target VMATs have possible applications for many conditions, leading to a plethora of biological research. These applications include hypertension, drug addiction, psychiatric disorders, Parkinson's disease, and other neurological disorders. Many drugs that target VMAT act as inhibitors and alter the kinetics of the protein. Much research regarding the effects of altered VMATs on biological systems is still ongoing. Isoforms The two VMAT isoforms are: * VMAT1 * VMAT2 Monoamines Monoamines transported by VMATs are mainly noradrenaline, adrenaline, dopamine, serotonin, histamine, and trace amines. Exogenous substrates include guanethidine and MPP+. Discovery VMAT research began in 1958 with the discovery of secretory vesicles by Nils-√Öke Hillarp. In the 1970s, scientists such as Arvid Carlsson recognized the need to understand how transport systems and ion gradients work in different organisms in order to explore new treatment options such as reserpine. Researchers discovered inhibitors that blocked the uptake of neurotransmitters into vesicles, suggesting the existence of VMATs. A decade later molecular genetic tools have improved methods for protein identification. Scientists have used these tools to analyze DNA and amino acid sequences, discovering that transporters in bacteria and humans were very similar. This finding illustrated the importance and universality of transporters. The transporters were first structurally identified by cloning VMATs in rats. VMAT was first isolated and purified in bovine chromaffin granules, in both native and denatured forms. Location There are two types of VMATs expressed in humans: VMAT1 and VMAT2. VMAT1 is expressed mainly in large dense-core vesicles (LDCVs) of the peripheral nervous system. VMAT1 may be found in neuroendocrine cells, particularly chromaffin and enterochromaffin granules which are largely found in the medulla of the adrenal glands. VMAT2 favors expression in a variety of monoaminergic cells of the CNS such as the brain, sympathetic nervous system, mast cells, It is also prevalent in Œ≤-cells of the pancreas. It is also expressed blood platelets. VMAT2 is also co-expressed in chromaffin cells. Expression of the two transporters in internal organs seems to differ between species: only VMAT1 is expressed in the rat adrenal medulla cells whereas VMAT2 is the major transporter in the bovine adrenal medulla cells. Structure and Function A Hydrogen atom from the inside of the vesicle binds, inducing a conformational change in the transporter The conformational change induced by the hydrogen atom binding enables the monoamine binding to the active transport site A second hydrogen atom binds from inside the vesicle to the transporter inducing another change The monoamine is released inside the vesicle and the two hydrogen atoms are released into the cytosol and the transport process starts over again. Both isoforms of VMAT, VMAT1 and VMAT2, are acidic glycoproteins with a molecular weight of approximately 70 kDa. Both isoforms are transmembrane proteins with 12 transmembrane domains (TMD‚Äôs). VMAT functions in loading the neurotransmitters dopamine, serotonin, histamine, norepinephrine, and epinephrine into transport vesicles.Purves, Dale, et al. Neuroscience. Sinauer Associates. 087893646 Collectively these neurotransmitters are referred to as monoamines. VMAT uses the same transport mechanism for all types of monoamines. VMATs transport monoamines from the cytosol into high-concentration storage vesicles. Transport vesicles are released into the space between neurons, called the synaptic cleft, where they convey a chemical message to the next neuron. VMATs also function in sorting, storing, and releasing neurotransmitters, and are believed to participate in protecting these neurotransmitters from autoxidation. VMATs are also known to continue biochemical modification after loading of certain neurotransmitters. Vesicle packing requires a large energy source to store large numbers of neurotransmitters into a small vesicular space at high concentrations. VMAT transport relies upon the pH and electrochemical gradient generated by a vesicular H+-ATPase for this energy source. The current model of VMAT function proposes that efflux of two protons against the H+ gradient is coupled with influx of one monoamine. The first H+ efflux generates a transporter conformation associated with a high-affinity amine-binding site in the cytosolic phase; the second H+ efflux is coupled with a second large conformational change that leads to amine transport from the cytosolic side into the vesicle, reducing amine-binding affinity. Studies indicate that the amino acid residue His419, located on the domain between TMD X and XI of rat VMAT1, plays a role in energy coupling to the amine transport by assisting the first proton-dependent conformational change.Shirvan A, Laskar O, Steiner- Mordoch S, Schuldiner S. (1994). \\"Histidine-419 plays a role in energy coupling in the vesicular monoamine transporter from rat.\\" FEBS Lett',' 356:145‚Äì150. It has been proposed that Reserpine (RES) inhibits VMAT by interacting with this conformation. VMAT gene sequence analysis demonstrates that 4 aspartic acid residues in the middle region of TMD I, VI, X, and XI and one Lysine residue in TMDII have highly conserved gene sequences, suggesting these residues play a critical role in transporter structure and function. Specifically, the residues Lys 139 and Asp 427 are thought to compose an ion pair that promotes high-affinity interaction with VMAT substrates and inhibitors. The Asp431 residue located in TMD XI is believed to be critical for amine transport, but does not interact with RES binding; this residue is thought to complete the substrate transport cycle. Kinetics VMATs have a relatively low Vmax, with an estimated rate of 5‚Äì20/sec depending on the substrate. Vesicle filling may limit monoamine release from neurons with high rates of firing. Specific amine-binding affinity varies by VMAT isoform; studies indicate that catecholamines dopamine, norepinephrine, and epinephrine have three-fold higher affinity for VMAT2 binding than for VMAT1 binding and uptake. The Imidazoleamine Histamine has a thirty-fold higher affinity for VMAT2 compared to VMAT1 and is thought to bind to a different site from that of other monoamines. Unlike catecholamines and histamine, the indoleamine serotonin (5HT) binds to VMAT1 and VMAT2 with a similar affinity for both transporter isoforms. VMAT1 has a lower turnover number and a lower affinity for most monoamine substrates than VMAT2. This may be because of VMAT2's location in the central nervous system, which demands fast recovery from neurotransmitter release in order to prepare for the subsequent release. The uptake efficiencies of each VMAT substrate can be ranked in order of efficiency as follows: serotonin, dopamine, epinephrine, and norepinephrine. Methamphetamines decrease Vmax, while cocaine increases Vmax reversibly in rat brain. Inhibition The effects of VMAT inhibition have been studied in- depth in animal models. Mutant homozygous VMAT(-/-) mice move little, feed poorly, and die within a few days of birth. More specifically, inhibition of VMAT2 may cause an increase in cytosolic catecholamine levels. This can result in an increase in efflux of catecholamines through the plasma membrane, depleting catecholamine concentrations and causing increased oxidative stress and oxidative damage to the neuron. Heterozygous VMAT mutants display hypersensitivity to amphetamine, cocaine and MPTP (1-methyl-4-phenyl-1,2,3,6-tetrahydropyridine), the latter being a substance causally linked to Parkinson's disease in rodents. This suggests a protective role of VMATs against oxidative stress through removal of such substances from the cytosol. VMAT inhibitors include: *Reserpine(RES), bietaserpine, and ketanserin(KET) (potent inhibitors of VMAT2 mediated serotonin transport) *Tetrabenazine(TBZ) (specific to VMAT2) *Phenylethylamine *Amphetamine *MDMA *N-methyl-4-phenylpyridinium (MPP+)(very potent inhibitors of VMAT2 mediated serotonin transport) *Fenfluramine (specific to VMAT1 ) *Non-hydrolysable GTP- analogue guanylyllimidodiphosphate GMP-P(NH)P (VMAT2 only) Binding Site Structures =Ligand-binding affinities and structures= Two known binding sites for VMAT inhibitors include the Reserpine (RES) binding site and the Tetrabenazine (TBZ) binding site. Some evidence suggests these two sites may overlap or may actually exist as two separate conformations of the same binding site. VMAT inhibitors tend to fall into two classes; those that interact with the RES binding site and those that interact with the TBZ binding site. Reserpine (RES), Methoxytetrabenazine (MTBZ), and the drug Amiodarone bind to the RES binding site conformation. Tetrabenazine (TBZ, also called Nitoman and Xenazine), Dihydrotetrabenazine (DTBZOH), Ketanserin (KET), and the drug Lobeline bind to the TBZ binding site/conformation. Amphetamine, methamphetamine and GZ-7931 are also known to interact with VMAT2.Vesicular monoamine transporter 2#Binding sites and ligands Inhibitor affinity varies among VMAT isoforms. RES and KET have higher inhibitory affinity for VMAT2‚Äìmediated 5HT transport than for that of VMAT1; TBZ seems to inhibit VMAT2 exclusively. The residues aspartate-33 and serines-180, 181, and 182 are believed to be involved in substrate recognition; these residues interact with the protonated amino group and hydroxyl group on the catechol or indole rings. Cocaine and methylphenidate (MPD, also known as Ritalin and Concerta) are believed to interact with VMAT2 in such a way that causes a shift in VMAT2 protein \\"from a plasmalemmal membrane-associated fraction to a vesicle- enriched, nonmembrane-associated fraction.\\" Reserpine binding site Consistent with catecholamine-binding affinity, Reserpine (RES) has a threefold higher affinity for VMAT2 than for VMAT1. The RES binding site is known to be hydrophobic, and this is thought to contribute to ligand binding affinity. Methamphetamine binds to the reserpine site on VMATs. The current working model proposes that RES and the substrate bind to a single site in a pH-gradient modulated conformational structure of the transporter. This conformation occurs after the transport of one proton across the membrane and into the vesicle; proton transport drives the substrate recognition site from the lumen to the cytoplasmic surface of the vesicle for RES and substrate binding. Methoxytetrabenazine (MTBZ) may bind to the RES binding site, based on studies indicating that RES significantly inhibited MTBZ-binding. The drug Amiodarone is also believed to inhibit monoamine vesicular uptake by binding to the RES binding site. Tetrabenazine binding site Tetrabenazine (TBZ) and Dihydrotetrabenazine (DTBZOH) are believed to bind to a different binding site from the RES/substrate binding site, or to a different conformation of the RES/substrate binding site. This site is believed to be located at the N-terminus, based on studies done in bovine VMAT2. Tyrosine-434 and aspartate-461 are identified as being responsible for the high-affinity interaction of TBZ, serotonin, and histamine in VMAT2. Unlike methamphetamine, amphetamine binds to the TBZ site on hVMAT2. Unlike Reserpine inhibition, TBZ inhibition is affected only by very high concentrations of monoamines; however, single injections of Reserpine can inhibit TBZ binding. Ketanserin (KET) and the drug Lobeline also bind to the TBZ binding site conformation. =Glycosolation sites: N- and C-linked terminals= Three to four glycosolation sites exist in the vesicular matrix on a loop between TMDI and TMDII. In biology, the vesicle matrix refers to the material or tissue between cells in which more specialized structures are embedded. Two of the glycosylation sites, the N-linked glycosylation terminal and C-linked terminal, are located in the cytosolic portion of the vesicle.Erickson, Eiden, & Hoffman, 1992 The highest amount of genetic variance between VMAT1 and VMAT2 exists near the N- and C- terminals in the cytosolic phase, and in the glycosylated loop between transmembrane domains I and II. =C-Terminus and VMAT Trafficking Cycle= Several motifs involved in the VMAT trafficking cycle are believed to be encoded in the C-terminus. A dileucine motif in the C-terminus is required for VMAT2 endocytosis. Studies suggest the acidic residues in the dileucine motif sort VMAT2 away from constitutive secretory vesicles and into the regulated secretory pathway. The hydrophobic residues in the dileucine motif are thought to further couple with the acidic residues as a single unit to help sort VMAT2 to large dense course vesicles. Acidic glutamate residues located upstream of the dileucine motif are known to be important for localization of VMAT2 to large dense core vesicles; these residues are also conserved in VMAT1. Genetic expression and transporter regulation Although both VMAT1 and VMAT2 are encoded by two different genes, the individual genetic sequences demonstrate high homology.Polymorphisms in VMAT2 that effect regulation and quantitative expression may pose genetic risk factors for Parkinson's disease. Moreover, a specific VMAT1 gene (SLC18A1) has several associated polymorphisms which have a locus 8p21.3 that has been strongly connected to schizophrenia susceptibility. Over-expression of VMAT2 results in increased secretion of neurotransmitter upon cell stimulation. Data suggests that deletion of the VMAT2 genes does not affect the size of small clear-core vesicles. VMATs may be regulated by changes in transcription, post- transcriptional modifications such as phosphorylation and mRNA splicing of exons, and vesicular transport inactivation facilitated by heterotrimeric G-proteins. It is thought that chromaffin granules possess these heterotrimeric G-proteins which have shown to be regulatory to small clear- core vesicles. Specific heterotrimeric G-protein type regulation is tissue- dependent for VMAT2; it is not known whether this is the case for VMAT1. Heterotrimeric G-protein GŒ±o2 decreases VMAT1 activity in pancreatic and adrenal medulla cells, and activates heterotrimeric G-proteins inhibit VMAT2 activity in the brain, regardless of whether localised on small clear-core or large-dense-core vesicles. Activated heterotrimeric G-protein GŒ±q downregulates VMAT2 mediated serotonin transport in blood platelets, but this is not the case in the brain where GŒ±q inhibits VMAT2 activity completely. Although the exact signalling pathway for G-protein mediated regulation of VMATs is not known, it has recently been described that implicated G-proteins act directly on the VMATs themselves.Remin, R., Schuldiner, S., 2003. Vesicular neurotransmitter transporters: Pharmacology, Biochemistry and Molecular Analysis. Neurotransmitter Transporters; Structure, Function, and Regulation, pp.313-354 Clinical significance VMAT2 has been shown to contribute to many clinical neurological disorders including drug addiction, mood disorders and stress, as well as Parkinson's Disease and Alzheimer's Disease. =Parkinson's disease= Studies indicate VMAT2 mRNA is present in all cell groups damaged by Parkinson's Disease (PD); these findings have identified VMAT2 as a target for Parkinson's prevention. VMAT2 presence does not independently protect neurons from Parkinsonian damage; however, a decrease in VMAT2 expression has been shown to correlate with susceptibility to Parkinson's Disease and this may be due to a ratio between the Dopamine transporter and VMAT2. Based on the understanding the increased cytosolic Dopamine levels lead to dopaminergic cell death in PD, it has been proposed that regulatory polymorphisms in VMAT2 affect VMAT2 quantitative expression and may serve as a genetic risk factor for PD. Specifically, the SLC18A2 promoter region for the VMAT2 gene has been identified as an area where several polymorphisms form discrete haplotypes. =Mood disorders= Studies using a genetic rodent model to understand clinical depression in humans suggest that VMAT2 genetic or functional alterations may play a role in depression. Reduced VMAT2 levels were identified in specific subregions of the striatum involved in clinical depression, including the nucleus accumbens shell but not the core, the ventral tegmental area, and the substantia nigra pars compacta. The reduced VMAT2 protein levels were not accompanied by similar levels of VMAT2 mRNA alterations. Based on these findings it has been proposed that VMAT2 activity is not altered at the level of genetic expression, but may rather be altered at the functional level in ways that may correlate with clinical depression. =Drug addiction= Many Psychostimulant drugs are known to interact with VMAT, including Amphetamine analogs such as Methamphetamine (METH), Cocaine, and Ecstasy (MDMA). See the Pharmacology section of this article for more information on these drugs' interactions. Pharmacology As addressed above, VMAT inhibitors tend to fall into two classes; those that interact with the RES binding site and those that interact with the TBZ binding site. Reserpine, methoxytetrabenazine, and the drug amiodarone bind to the RES binding site conformation. Tetrabenazine (branded Nitoman and Xenazine), dihydrotetrabenazine, ketanserin, and the drug lobeline bind to the TBZ binding site/conformation. Substituted amphetamines, including but not limited to methamphetamine, as well as cocaine, are known to interact with VMAT2. Studies indicate that both amphetamines and cocaine act to increase non-exocytotic release of dopamine in specific regions of the brain by interacting directly with VMAT2 function. =Methamphetamine= VMAT is a main target of methamphetamine. Studies indicate that substituted amphetamines including methamphetamine interact with VMAT2 at the TBZ/DTBZOH binding site/conformation. By acting as a competitive antagonist, methamphetamine blocks the presynaptic cell's ability to use VMAT for vesicular packaging. Methamphetamine alters the subcellular location of VMAT2 which affects the distribution of dopamine in the cell. Treatment with methamphetamine relocates VMAT2 from a vesicle-enriched fraction to a location that is not continuous with synaptosomal preparations. Repeated amphetamine exposure may increase VMAT2 mRNA in certain brain regions with little or no decline upon withdrawal from the drug. A study performed by Sonsalla et al. demonstrates that methamphetamine treatment decreases DHTBZ binding and vesicular Dopamine uptake. Another study demonstrated that multiple high doses of methamphetamine removed DTBZ binding sites from the vesicles. In addition to an interaction with the TBZ/DTBZOH binding site, some propose that substituted amphetamines like methamphetamine decrease dopamine uptake because of the weak base properties of substituted amphetamines. This ‚ÄúWeak Base Hypothesis‚Äù proposes that amphetamine analogs enters the cell through transport and lipophilic diffusion then likewise diffuses through the vesicular membrane where it accumulates in synaptic vesicles and offsets the proton electrochemical gradient in the vesicle that drives monoamine transport through VMAT. In this way, amphetamine administration would prevent vesicular DA uptake through VMAT, and explain the finding that amphetamine administration correlates with decreased dopamine release from vesicles and a neurotoxic increase in intracellular dopamine. =Cocaine= Unlike methamphetamine, the psychostimulant cocaine interacts with VMAT2 in such a way that mobilizes VMAT2-expressing vesicles, causing a shift in VMAT2 protein from a plasmalemmal (synaptosomal) membrane fraction to a vesicle-enriched fraction that is not associated with the synaptosomal membrane and not retained in synaptosomal preparations. The drug methylphenidate (branded Ritalin and Concerta) is believed to interact with VMAT2 in a similar fashion. In addition to mobilizing VMAT2-expressing vesicles, cocaine has been shown to increase Vmax of VMAT2 for dopamine, and to increase the number of DTBZ binding sites. Cocaine has also been shown to mobilize a synapsin-dependent reserve pool of dopamine-containing synaptic vesicles, thereby interacting with the vesicular trafficking cycle to increase dopamine release. Short-term exposure to cocaine increases VMAT2 density in the prefrontal cortex and striatum of mammalian brains. This is theorised to be a defensive mechanism against the depletive effects cocaine has on cytosolic dopamine through increasing monoamine storage capacity. Chronic cocaine use has been implicated with a reduction in VMAT2 immunoreactivity as well as a decrease in DTBZOH binding in humans. Research suggests a decline in VMAT2 protein through prolonged cocaine use could play an important role in the development of cocaine induced mood-disorders. =MDMA= The psychostimulant MDMA (popularized as ecstasy or XTC) is known to affect serotonergic neurons, but has been shown to inhibit synaptosomal and vesicular uptake of serotonin and dopamine to roughly the same extent in vitro. in vivo studies indicate short-term MDMA exposure causes short-term reduction in VMAT2 activity, which is reversed after 24h. Current Research =Clinical Research= Genetic research models have shown that polymorphisms in SLC18A1 and SLC18A2, the genes that encode for VMAT1 and 2 proteins respectively, may confer risk for some neuropsychiatric disorders;. however, no specific diseases have yet been identified as directly resulting from a genetic mutation in an SLC18 gene, the gene that codes for VMAT proteins. Much of the current research related to VMAT explores the genetic underpinnings of neuropsychiatric disorders as they may be affected by SLC18A family mutations. The dopaminergic neuron is known to play a central role in drug addiction and abuse and the potential role of the dopamine transporter (DAT) has been well- explored as a target for amphetamine and cocaine. Current research looks toward VMAT2 as a target for such psychostimulants. This is discussed in the Pharmacology section of this article. A combination of imaging, neurochemical, biochemical, cell biological, genetic, and immunohistochemical evidence has been compiled to provide the most current comprehensive understanding of the role the VMAT2 plays in AMPH and cocaine abuse and addiction through aminergic neurotransmission. As VMATs are membrane proteins, structural information is limited and researchers have yet to completely understand the structure of both isoforms. Further studies are needed in order to determine the structure and therefore complete function of these proteins. There is preliminary evidence that the gene for VMAT1 may be linked to susceptibility to schizophrenia, bipolar disorder, and various anxiety disorders. Further studies are needed in order to confirm these findings and to gain a better understanding of the role of VMATs in the central nervous system. Multiple single-nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) have been identified in the coding region of VMATs. The effects of some of these SNPs have been alteration of VMAT function, structure and regulation.Sager, J.J. & Torres, G.E., 2011. Proteins interacting with monoamine transporters: Current state and future challenges. Biochemistry, [online] Available at: [Accessed 20 April 2013] Further investigation of these SNPs is required in order to distinguish whether they may be attributable to certain diseases with suspected SNP- mutation origins. Œ±-synuclein, a cytosolic protein found mainly in pre- synaptic nerve terminals has been found to have regulatory interactions with the trafficking of VMATs. Moreover, mutations involving Œ±-synuclein have been linked to familial Parkinson‚Äôs Disease. Further research is needed to clarify the extent to which these proteins modulate the trafficking of VMATs and whether they may be exploited in order to gather more information as to the exact mechanism of how disorders such as Parkinson‚Äôs occur, and therefore, how they may potentially be treated. Studies have shown that at the synaptic membrane, enzymes responsible for the synthesis of dopamine, tyrosine hydroxylase (TH) and amino acid aromatic decarboxylase (AADC) are physically and functionally coupled with VMAT2. It was initially thought that the synthesis of these substances and the subsequent packaging of them into vesicles were two entirely separate processes. Such a finding could impact the approach to treatment methods for dopamine-related disorders such as schizophrenia and Parkinson‚Äôs Disease. =Animal research= Current research related to VMAT uses VMAT2 knockout mice to explore the behavioral genetics of this transporter in an animal model. VMAT2 knockouts are known to be lethal as homozygotes, but heterozygote knockouts are not lethal and are used in many studies as a durable animal model. For more complete discussions on VMAT2 animal research, see discussions in the following review articles: (Lawal & Krantz, 2013), From knockout and knockdown mice researchers have discovered that it is good to have over-expression or under-expression of the VMAT genes in some circumstances. Mice are also used in drug studies, particularity studies involving the effect cocaine and methamphetamine have on VMATs. Studies involving animals have prompted scientists to work on developing drugs that inhibit or enhance the function of VMATs. Drugs that inhibit VMATs may have use in addiction but further studies are needed. Enhancing the function of VMATs may also have therapeutic value.

This style of teaching made it difficult for children to master these early skills, and as a result, did not advance to more advanced literacy instruction and often continued to receive age-inappropriate instruction (e.g., singing the alphabet song). During the mid-to-late 1970s, the education system shifted to targeting functional skills that were age appropriate for people with special needs. This led to teaching sight words that were viewed as necessary for participation in the school and community (e.g., \\"exit\\", \\"danger\\", \\"poison\\", \\"go\\"). This approach was an improvement to previous practices, but it limited the range of literacy skills that people with special needs developed. A newer model for reading development, specifically with regard to early reading development, is emergent literacy, sometimes referred to as early literacy, model. This model purports that children begin reading from birth, and that learning to read is an interactive process based on children‚Äôs exposure to literate activities. It is under this new model that children with developmental disabilities and special needs have been considered to be able to learn to read. Note that there is limited research regarding reading in special needs, but this article attempts to represent the most current evidence on this topic. Literacy Literacy refers to both reading and writing skills, writing being the symbolic representation of language, and reading the cognitive process of decoding and understanding the written symbol system. These are very broad and basic definitions as the definitions of these terms often vary based on the model or approach. Approaches and models of reading There are multiple models and approaches of reading. A few are discussed below. =The Simple View of Reading= The Simple View of Reading was originally described by Gough and Tunmer in 1986 and modified by Hoover and Gough in 1990. The Simple View suggests that the ultimate goal of reading comprehension, and in order to have good reading comprehension, you need to have good decoding ability (e.g., ability to interpret the symbols) and good listening comprehension (e.g., your ability to understand oral language). This model predicts four categories of readers. Readers with poor decoding skills but relatively preserved listening comprehension skills would be considered readers who are poor decoders, or dyslexic. Readers with poor listening comprehension skills are referred to as readers who are poor comprehenders. Readers with poor decoding skills and poor listening comprehension skills are considered poor readers, or sometimes referred to as garden-variety poor readers. Readers who have good decoding and listening comprehension skills are considered typical readers. =The Connectionist Model of Reading Development= Connectionist models have emphasized an interconnected and interactive system of mappings between printed words (orthography), spoken sounds/words (phonology), and word meanings (semantics). The computation of these three codes (orthographic, phonologic, and semantic) is required for reading. According to Seidenberg and McClelland, one mechanism is involved in reading (including reading regular words, exception words, and nonwords). Through development, experience with meaningful words and spelling-sound correspondences allow one‚Äôs representation of semantics, orthography, and phonology to be modified. Developing representations of orthography, phonology, and semantics is an interactive process where development of one component influences and is influenced by the other components. =Dual-route approach= The dual-route approach suggests that two separate mechanisms, or routes, can be used in word reading. Words that follow spelling-sound rules (including regular words and nonwords that follow letter-to-sound rules) are processed through the nonlexical route. The nonlexical route follows a system of rules specifying the relationship between letters and sounds to process words. Conversely, exception words, or irregular words, that do not follow the spelling-sound rules are processed through the lexical route. The lexical route can be thought of as a dictionary lookup procedure. =Whole language= Reading is a linguistic act. With this, some have applied the whole language philosophy to reading instruction. In the early 1990s, a movement for whole language encouraged educators to view learning to read as being similar to learning to talk. This philosophy emphasizes learning language and reading skills through meaningful experiences instead of through decontextualized rule teaching. Some other terms for this approach of reading instruction include literature-based instruction and guided reading. =Balanced Literacy Instruction= To meet the recommendations of breadth and depth of literacy instruction set by the National Reading Panel (2000), many literacy programs incorporate four main components: guided reading, which focuses on comprehension skills though exposure to a wide range of literature experiences; word study, which incorporates phonics, phonemic awareness, and vocabulary instruction; self- selected reading, which provides children daily experiences in independent reading time; and writing, which focuses on both the mechanics of composition and on communicating effectively for multiple purposes (Foley & Stables, 2007). Populations at increased risk Children with language difficulties are at increased risk for reading disorders or difficulties that can occur early on in preschool and continue on throughout development. This population includes children with language abilities that fall below expectations for their chronological age, at a clinical level or with weaknesses in language that are not severe enough to meet criteria for a clinical diagnosis of a language disorder. Children with other disabilities can also have language impairments that can cause an increase risk of developing reading problems. Such disabilities include (but are not restricted to): Specific language impairment, phonological disorder, Language disorder, Developmental disability, autism spectrum disorder, Down syndrome, Fragile x syndrome, and Cerebral palsy. People with severe speech difficulties can use Augmentative and alternative communication (AAC) devices. The importance and positive outcomes of literacy for people with language difficulties and AAC users are endless. As with everyone literacy opens doors to education, employment, and allows ‚Äúindividuals to exchange information, maintain interpersonal communication, to convey needs and wants and to develop channels of personal expression\\".Light, J., & Kelford Smith, A. (1993). Home literacy experiences of preschoolers who use AAC systems and of their nondisabled peers. Augmentative and Alternative Communication, 9, 10‚Äì25 p. 10. However, for the AAC user literacy skills may be of even greater importance as reading and writing ‚Äúallows individuals with severe speech impairments the opportunity to initiate topics, to develop ideas, to provide clarification, to communicate independently, to interact with a diverse audience, and to express ideas, thoughts, and feelings.‚ÄùLight, J., & Kelford Smith, A. (1993). Home literacy experiences of preschoolers who use AAC systems and of their nondisabled peers. Augmentative and Alternative Communication, 9, 10‚Äì25 p.10 Unfortunately, even given the importance of literacy skills people who use AAC are often not given ‚Äúauthentic learning opportunities‚Äú to learn literacy skills.Janet M. Sturm Associate Professor, Stephanie A. Spadorcia, James W. Cunningham, Kathleen S. Cali, Amy Staples, Karen Erickson, David E. Yoder & David A. Koppenhaver (2006) What happens to reading between first and third grade? Implications for students who use AAC, Augmentative and Alternative Communication, 22:1, 21-36 p. 21, DOI: 10.1080/07434610500243826 More research is needed on how to increase literacy instruction to people with severe speech difficulties and users of AAC. Intervention Team Classroom teachers are expected to provide the primary source of reading instruction for most students. Special education teachers may supplement the classroom instruction in reading and writing skills based on the independent performance of their students. Other professionals including a reading specialist, a speech- language pathologist, an educational or school psychologist, and an occupational therapist may also provide reading and writing support to individuals with reading and writing difficulties. Subgroups of reading problems =Difficulties with decoding= In general terms, individuals who have challenges in decoding are referred to as poor decoders. Dyslexia is a more specific disability where individuals demonstrate difficulty with decoding. Poor decoders have not acquired the basic knowledge of sound-letter correspondence rules, specifically phonological skills (skills that include identifying and manipulation of words, syllables, onsets, rimes, and phonemes -individual sounds). In addition, language abilities often evidence poor morphological and syntactic knowledge. Interventions that target decoding abilities may include instruction in phonics, phonological awareness, and phonemic awareness (also see Dyslexia intervention). =Difficulties with reading rate= Some individuals may have difficulty with reading rate, where they have accurate word recognition and often normal comprehension abilities, but reading speed that is typically one and a half years below grade level. Strategies that may improve reading rate include: shared/partner reading, guided reading, repeated reading, and silent reading, listening to another person fluently read (National Reading Panel, 2000;). =Difficulties with reading fluency= Individuals may also have trouble with reading fluency, or accurate, smooth, and appropriately paced reading with accurate expression. Strategies: shared/partner reading, guided reading, repeated reading, and silent reading, listening to another person fluently read (National Reading Panel, 2000). =Difficulties with reading comprehension= Some individuals may have skills within the normal range on the above factors but may still have trouble with reading comprehension. These individuals are often referred to as poor comprehenders, or individuals with a specific comprehension deficit. Strategies that can be used to improve reading comprehension include: building oral and auditory language skills, including skills in: vocabulary knowledge, narratives, listening comprehension, and figurative language. Additionally, when working toward increasing reading comprehension for specific texts, one can preteach vocabulary words and discuss prior knowledge on a topic related to the text before reading. (Also see reading comprehension for more strategies and information.) =Mixed reading difficulties= Children can have difficulties in more than one of the areas previously listed. Reading in special populations Reading difficulties in special populations such as Downs syndrome, autism, and cerebral palsy follow similar patterns of reading development and reading difficulty as described in the subgroups of reading problems section. =Down syndrome= It has been found true for children with intellectual disabilities, such as children with Down syndrome, that phonological awareness skills are often deficient and require targeted teaching. For example, studies have found that children with Down syndrome show deficits in phonological awareness, and though they can develop such skills, often rely on sight word vocabulary knowledge rather than phonological awareness skills to decode words. Given this, it is recommended that phonological awareness skills be taught in a systematic manner with explicit instruction of how to use these skills when reading. =Autism= Children with autism spectrum disorder (ASD) have been identified as having particular difficulties with reading comprehension despite normal decoding abilities,. Historically, those individuals who are especially good at decoding but have poor comprehension are considered to have hyperlexia. Not all individuals with autism, however, are poor comprehenders as there is a wide range of abilities in children on the spectrum. Despite the type of reader an individual with autism might be, individuals should be given the opportunity to learn to read. Very few studies have examined the effectiveness of interventions for reading for individuals with ASD. Using computer-assisted instruction to implement programs for individuals with ASD that target skills in decoding could be an effective way to help improve these skills in these individuals. Procedural facilitation tasks such as prereading questions, anaphoric cuing, or a cloze task helped to improve reading comprehension with the anaphoric cuing task being the most effective task. =Cerebral palsy= Children with cerebral palsy (CP) may or may not have motor speech impairments and/or language impairments, which can lead to reading difficulties. Often children with CP can be classified as having severe speech and physical impairments (SSPI), but children with other disorders can fall into this category as well. Children with SSPI can be at increased risk for reading difficulties not only because they may have language impairments, but also because they can have limited literary experiences and limited reading instruction. Additionally, parents and teachers may have low expectations of the child‚Äôs ability to become a reader, which may influence experiences with text and impact literacy instruction. Assistive technology (also Alternative and Augmentative Communication devices; AAC) can be used to overcome physical barriers to manipulating books, and to augment speech motor and language difficulties (e.g., type, or select symbols to identify rhyming words), and cognitive impairments (to provide needed support required for target skill acquisition) (Copeland & Keef, 2007, see chapter 9). Of course, access to assistive devices is not sufficient for reading development. Appropriate reading instruction is required (e.g., instruction in phonological awareness skills, phonemic awareness skills, phonics, fluency, vocabulary, text comprehension, and book conventions), regularly conducted story reading sessions, constructive AT/AAC use to target literacy skills, high expectations of student literacy achievement, and text-rich environments have been found to be important for developing literacy skills in children with CP.

BASIC 8.0 provided commands lacking in BASIC 7.0 to generate (color) graphics in the C128's high-resolution 80-column mode (640√ó200 pixels) for RGB monitors. The BASIC 8 package was developed by Walrusoft's Louis Wallace and David Darus, with contributions from Ken French (printer drivers) and indirectly from Richard Rylander (who allowed his 3D solids commands for the C64, originally published in Dr. Dobb's Journal, to be converted to the C128's hi-res mode). Background and description =The problem= One of the primary critiques of Commodore's computers was that their BASIC programming language dialects lacked easy sound, graphics, and input device commands, like their competitors in the Apple II and Atari 8-bit families requiring obscure PEEK and POKE sequences, or machine language routines, to generate high-resolution graphics, sound and music, or read from joysticks and paddles. The BASIC 2.0 of the Commodore 64, totally devoid of sound and graphics commands, induced the development of many third-party language extensions, such as Simons' BASIC, enabling non-expert users to enter the world of computer graphics. When the C128 was launched, its BASIC 7.0 contained a host of sound and graphics commands. However, they only worked in the \\"40-column\\" video mode, i.e. the TV/composite monitor mode with a resolution equal to the C64's. Users who wanted to program graphics in the C128's new high-resolution \\"80-column mode\\", primarily intended for RGBI monitors, found themselves in an even worse position than previously with the C64, since the C128's 8563 VDC graphics chip was much harder to program than the VIC-II. =A solution= BASIC 8.0 filled in the gap. It came on floppy disk and ROM chip versions, and provided many graphics commands that were competitive with the C128's opposition in the high-end 8-bit microcomputer market. BASIC 8.0 was fully compatible with the various first-party RAM and video RAM expansion chips and cartridges, as well as mice and joysticks. In addition, it had basic 3D graphics commands. Along with a 188-page manual, the included software package included a BASIC 8.0 example of a GUI, and a BASIC 8.0 based high-res paint program, Basic Paint. Source code, copy protection Source code of some of the BASIC 8 package was provided, and the BASIC 8.0 disk lacked any sort of copy protection, but this was before the Open Source Initiative; it was done as a courtesy. Instead of threatening legal action, Walrusoft simply asked users not to copy the software in the documentation. It worked; BASIC 8.0 became one of the best selling expansions for the C128. Sample commands In BASIC 8.0, all added commands were prefaced with the @ mark, which was not normally used in Commodore BASIC, to distinguish between the original and the new keywords. The use of this character would allow the developer to extend BASIC 7.0 without having to re- tokenize the commands as it was done on the C64. It was accomplished by trapping the syntax error generated by the command. * \`@CHAR\` - Displays a text string on a bitmap field (similar to the BASIC 7.0's low-res \`CHAR\` command) * \`@MODE\` - Switch between one of up to 32 high-res screens * \`@PAINT\` - Fill a closed area with a color or a pattern * \`@PIXEL\` - Returns the color value of a pixel * \`@STASH\` - Copies part or all of a screen for later usage * \`@WALRUS\` - Displays the Walrusoft logo and the type/size of video RAM used (16K or 64K) * \`@WINDOWOPEN\` - Define part of the screen as a 'window' for purposes of drawing References notes and citations =References= * =Notes= # The VDC was programmed by writing commands to and reading status messages from a single control register and transferring data between system RAM and the chip's dedicated video RAM (16 or 64 KB, depending on C128 version) via a single data register, following a relatively complex protocol a laborious and slow procedure compared with the straightforward use of the several discrete, memory mapped control/status registers the shared system/video memory setup of the VIC-II. Many programmers took advantage of a VDC control primitive buried deep within the part of the KERNAL that controlled the 80 column video display, rather than writing their own primitive. =Citations= External links *Basic 8 Manual (270-KB text file) From the Project 64 documentation project Category:BASIC extensions Category:Commodore 128 software ","title":"BASIC 8"},{"id":"1246427","text":"Donald Fraser may refer to: * Donald Fraser (footballer), Scottish footballer who played for Sheffield United in 1889-90 * Donald Fraser (geologist) (born 1949), English geologist * Donald Allan Fraser (1793‚Äì1843), Presbyterian minister in Nova Scotia and Newfoundland * Donald B.

Early life Wainwright was born in Liverpool, England on February 24, 1792. He was the son of Peter Wainwright and Elizabeth (n√©e Mayhew) Wainwright (1759‚Äì1829), who met on a trip to England from the United States and married in 1790. His father was a prosperous English tobacco merchant who emigrated from England to Boston and became a citizen after the American Revolution. His mother was the daughter of Reverend Jonathan Mayhew of Boston. His parents didn't return to Massachusetts until eleven years later, in 1802. Among his siblings was Eliza Wainwright (b. 1794), who married Dr. Walter Channing, a prominent obstetrician. His brother, Robert Dewar Wainwright, was the father of Richard Wainwright, an American Civil War naval officer. Jonathan graduated from Harvard College in 1812, where he was afterward a tutor. He received the degree of D.D. from Union College in 1823, and from Harvard in 1835. The degree of D.C.L. was conferred upon him by Oxford University in 1852. Career On April 13, 1817, he was ordered deacon in the Episcopal Church in Trinity Church, Boston and on May 29, 1818, he was ordained as a priest in Christ Church, Hartford, Connecticut, of which he later became rector. In November 1819, he moved to New York and became assistant minister in Trinity Church. He was made rector of Grace Church in 1821, and remained in that charge until 1834, when he became rector of Trinity Church, Boston. In 1837m he returned to Trinity Parish, New York, as assistant in charge of St. John's Chapel, which post he retained until he was elevated to the episcopate with the exception of six months' service in 1850 as rector-elect of Calvary Church in Gramercy Park. He was for many years secretary of the house of bishops, and was instrumental in the founding of New York University. He was considered one of the first pulpit orators of his day. He wielded great social influence, was a ripe scholar, and was a devoted lover of music, contributing toward its improvement in the churches of his denomination. He was secretary of the board of trustees of the General Theological Seminary in 1828-34, and a trustee or officer of many other institutions and societies. In 1844, he engaged in a controversy with his friend George Potts, which grew out of an assertion that Rufus Choate made at a celebration of the New England society. The orator said that the Pilgrim fathers had founded a \\"state without a king and a church without a bishop.\\" At the dinner that followed, Wainwright, in responding to a sentiment, said in reply that \\"there is no church without a bishop.\\" The subsequent discussion with Potts, which was carried on in nineteen letters in the New York Commercial Advertiser, was published as a book No Church Without a Bishop; or, the Controversy between the Rev. Drs. Potts and Wainwright. With a Preface by the Latter, and an Introduction and Notes by an Anti-Sectarian. On October 1, 1852, Wainwright was elected provisional bishop of the Episcopal Diocese of New York.John Nicholas Norton, Life of Bishop Wainwright (General Protestant Episcopal Sunday School Union and Church Book Society, 1858.), 134.

He also painted still lifes with no figures in the central scene.Joachim Beuckelaer at the Netherlands Institute for Art History His development of the genre of market and kitchen scenes was influential on the development of still life art in Northern Europe as well as Italy.The Collector's Cabinet: Flemish Paintings from New England Private Collections, Univ of Massachusetts Press, 1983, pp. 16‚Äì19 Life Details about the life of the artist are scarce. Beuckelaer was born in Antwerp into a family of painters. He was likely the son of the painter Mattheus Beuckeleer and the brother of Huybrecht Beuckeleer.Huybrecht Beuckeleer at the Netherlands Institute for Art History His brother also became a painter and the works of Huybrecht have occasionally been misattributed to Joachim. He possibly learned to paint in the workshop of his uncle, Pieter Aertsen, who had married his aunt Kathelijne Beuckelaer. Aertsen was best known for his market and kitchen scenes, genres. Beuckelaer became an independent master in the Antwerp Guild of Saint Luke in 1560. Beuckelaer remained active in Antwerp throughout his career and continued to develop themes pioneered in painting by Aertsen, but arguably surpassing his presumed master in skill. The date of his death is not known with certainty but fell likely between 1570 and 1574. Kitchen scene with Christ at Emmaus Work Beuckelaer specialised in market and kitchen scenes with elaborate displays of food and household equipment. During the 1560s, especially during the early part of the decade, Beuckelaer painted some purely religious works, for which, unlike the kitchen and market scenes, drawings are known. In this period he also made designs for stained glass. Slaughtered pig Beuckelaer's market scenes, like those of Aertsen, often incorporate biblical episodes in the background. His Four Elements series, acquired by the National Gallery, London in 2001, exemplifies this on a large scale. Water, for example, shows a fish market selling twelve kinds of fish, representing the twelve disciples of Jesus. Through an archway in the background Christ can be seen walking on the Sea of Galilee after his resurrection, making fish appear miraculously in empty nets. Both Aertsen and Beuckelaer gradually developed images that detached the world of produce from the religious content of their earlier hybrid images. These later works depict either kitchens or markets and the persons associated with those activities, more often women than men. The later paintings by Beuckelaer show a greater profusion of foodstuffs in the market scenes, together with a more prominent foregrounding of female peasants immersed within these sales items. Beuckelaer also produced several images of fish stalls, often with background religious scenes, but sometimes completely separated from any additional narrative or reference. In the year 1563 Beuckelaer was experimenting with more outspoken landscape settings in an innovative way, which left its marks with later artists in Antwerp. Fish Market One of the still lives without figures in the kitchen or market scene itself is the Kitchen scene with Christ at Emmaus (c. 1660/65, Mauritshuis, The Hague) is unique in his oeuvre. In this composition Beuckelaer painted a kitchen with numerous ingredients for a lavish meal: vegetables, fruits, nuts, poultry and a large cut of meat. The table linen and crockery are also in view. In the background, Beuckelaer depicted the biblical story of Christ at Emmaus. This story is pushed into the background while the secondary matter of the dinner preparations for Christ's visit at Emmaus has become the painting‚Äôs main subject. This and similar scenes are regarded as the forerunners of the still-lifes of the 17th century, in which the narrative elements vanished entirely.Joachim Beuckelaer, Kitchen scene with Christ at Emmaus at the Mauritshuis His still life of a carcass referred to as Slaughtered pig (Wallraf-Richartz Museum) dated 1563 is likely the earliest dated example of this subject. Beuckelaer was also employed painting the figures in the work of other artists such as Anthonis Mor and Cornelis van Dalem. The 17th century biographer Karel van Mander claimed that the artist was only able to sell his paintings at low prices, and that they only became prized after his death. However, the large size of his later works and the number of workshop variants produced has been taken as an indication of a degree of success at least towards the end of his life. Research into the technique underlying Beuckelaer's canvases has shown that he often recycled his own compositions from one image to the next. He employed patterns of clustered items through tracings to compose new pictures with apparent variety. This kind of technique allowed him to increase production efficiency and cut costs in time and effort. His work was influential. The Flemish still life and animal painter Frans Snyders developed his Baroque many market scenes by taking inspiration of the work of Aertsen and Beuckelaer.Frans Snyders, The game dealer at Christie‚Äôs Northern Italian painters such as Vincenzo Campi and Jacopo Bassano were also influenced by his work.

QEH was known for its high academic standards, competitive sports teams and distinguished extra-curricular activities such as its annual model parliament and musical productions. Its Reach for the Top team won the CBC-TV national championship in 1975. Queen Elizabeth High School was part of the Halifax community for 65 years, and offered many services and facilities including a 1280-seat performance auditorium that opened in 1951. QEH closed in 2007, merging with longtime rival St. Patrick's High School to form Citadel High School. History Queen Elizabeth High School was formed by a merger of two former schools, the Halifax Academy and Bloomfield High School, which were considered overcrowded and outdated. It was built during World War II on Camp Hill, facing Robie Street, and opened on 2 September 1942. The new school was named after Queen Elizabeth (popularly known after 1952 as the Queen Mother), who had visited Halifax in 1939 with King George VI. Queen Elizabeth was registered as a designated school for children of the United States Armed Forces and Diplomatic Corps, and had a long tradition of attracting students from other parts of Canada as well as from overseas. Live!, the first live album released by legendary Canadian rock and roll band April Wine, was recorded in the QEH auditorium in 1974. Queen Elizabeth High School was merged with nearby St. Patrick's High School to form Citadel High School. The new school is located across the street from the former site of Queen Elizabeth, adjacent to Citadel Hill. Ground breaking for Citadel High School took place in April 2006, and the final classes at QEH finished in June 2007. Queen Elizabeth closed as the academically top-ranked high school in Nova Scotia (based on the Atlantic Institute for Market Studies annual rankings of high schools). The building was demolished in 2011, and its former land was transferred to the Province of Nova Scotia. During the demolition, workers discovered an unmarked, sealed copper time capsule behind the school's cornerstone. Opened in September 2011 at Citadel High School, the capsule contained newspapers, school planning documents, and other paraphernalia from 1941. Over the short term, a community garden has been developed on the site and includes a walking path from Robie Street to Bell Road. In the future, the land is slated to be developed by the Nova Scotia Health Authority as an expansion to the neighbouring Queen Elizabeth II Health Sciences Centre. Queen Elizabeth High School hosted numerous successful reunions in its history and one final reunion, the \\"Last Chance Reunion\\" took place from July 27 to 29, 2007. Campus Queen Elizabeth High School occupied a sloping site on the corner of Bell Road and Robie Street, popularly known as the \\"Willow Tree\\" intersection. The sprawling school building, located opposite the Halifax Common and the Quinpool Road commercial district, was built in phases from the 1940s to 1960s. It had four teaching levels as well as a clock tower. Though the school was originally planned to include a gymnasium and auditorium, construction of these facilities was deferred due to the war and a lack of funds. Work began in 1950, and the gym and auditorium were opened in 1951. Erminie was the first musical presented in the new auditorium. The first phase of the school, as well as the subsequent gym/auditorium addition, were designed by architect C.A. Fowler (1891‚Äì1950) of Halifax. More classrooms were added in the late 1950s, but the school remained overcrowded into the 1960s. The authorities discussed a variety of options to deal with the problem including adding another storey to the school, building a new high school in the north end, or building an extension to QEH. They finally settled on the latter option, and in February 1969 the Board of School Commissioners opened an addition along Bell Road that more than doubled the school's size. Queen Elizabeth High School's facilities included a library, art rooms, music rooms, technology education shops, science laboratories, computer laboratories, family studies rooms, a reading resource room, a learning support centre, an ESL centre, a gymnasium, an auditorium and a full-service cafeteria ‚Äì all of which were accessible to the physically challenged. Model parliament Queen Elizabeth High School had one of the oldest-running high school model parliaments in all of North America, founded in 1952. This became one of the most prized traditions of the school and continues at Citadel High School. =Previous Opposition Leaders and Prime Ministers= *2007: Edgar Burns (Liberal) and Zephyr Armsworthy (Conservative) *2006: Shenglong Gao (Conservative) and Marc Trussler (Liberal) *2005: Aaron Ingersoll (Conservative), and James Mosher (Liberal) *2004: Kaitlin Pianosi (Conservative) and James Mosher (Liberal) *1994: Neil MacFarlane (PM-Reform) and Jacob Zimmer (LO-NDP) *1990: Michael S.

Bob Douglas, who has become a local basketball coaching legend, headed the team. Douglas died in 2008, but his coaching success at QEH spanned three decades and he coached or influenced perhaps most of the best players that came from Nova Scotia over that period. In the 1980s alone, the QEH Lions won four consecutive provincial titles and Douglas was officially recognized by the National Association of Basketball Coaches. The Nova Scotia high school league in general was very competitive, and by the midpoint of the 1980s, basketball had become the most popular sport for both girls and boys at the high school level. =Football= The QEH Lions football team had a storied history, and ranks amongst the most successful high school programmes in Canada. Head Coach Mike Tanner was the 1999 recipient of the NFL Canada Youth Coach of the Year Award. Tanner, a former QEH Lions player himself, also taught High School Physical Education throughout his career as head coach of the football team. Many other former Lions players also returned as coaches including Jeff Lawley, who coached defence from the 1990s until the programme was merged with that of Saint Patrick's at Citadel High.

She was Bolivia's first female Head of State, and the second in the history of the Americas (the first was Isabel Per√≥n in Argentina between 1974 and 1976). She was the cousin of American actress Raquel Welch. Background and earlier career Gueiler was born in Cochabamba, to Mois√©s Gueiler Grunewelt, an immigrant from Germany and a Bolivian mother, Raquel Tejada Albornoz. She received a BA degree from Instituto Americano in Cochabamba. In the 1940s, she joined the Movimiento Nacionalista Revolucionario (MNR). When that party came to power as a result of the 1952 National Revolution, Gueiler became a member of the Congress of Bolivia, serving in that capacity from 1956 until 1964. In 1964, she went into exile abroad after the MNR was toppled from power by generals Barrientos and Ovando. She spent the next fifteen years out of the country, and joined Juan Lech√≠n's Revolutionary Party of the Nationalist Left (PRIN). She also became the vice-president of the Revolutionary Left Front.Crespo Rodas, Alfonso. Lydia: una mujer en la historia. La Paz: Plural Ed, 1999. p. 121 Upon returning to Bolivia in 1979, Gueiler again ran for Congress and was elected President of the Chamber of Deputies of Bolivia (the lower house of the Bolivian Congress) as part of the MNR alliance of former president V√≠ctor Paz Estenssoro. As no presidential candidate in the 1979 elections had received the necessary 50% of the vote, it fell to Congress to decide who should be president. Surprisingly, no agreement could be reached, no matter how many votes were taken. An alternative was offered in the form of the President of the Senate of Bolivia, Dr. W√°lter Guevara, who was named temporary Bolivian President in August 1979 pending the calling of new elections in 1980. Guevara was shortly afterwards overthrown in a military coup led by General Alberto Natusch. The population resisted, however, led by a nationwide labor strike called by the powerful Central Obrera Boliviana (\\"COB\\") of Juan Lech√≠n. In the end, Natusch was able to occupy the Palacio Quemado for only sixteen days, after which he was forced to give up power. The only face-saving concession he extracted from Congress was the promise that Guevara not be allowed to resume his duties as president. Interim President of Bolivia The above condition was accepted and a new provisional president was found in Lidia Gueiler, then leader of the lower congressional house. As interim President, Gueiler was entrusted with the task of conducting new elections, which were held on 29 June 1980. =Overthrown in bloody coup= Before the winners could take their parliamentary seats, however, Gueiler herself was overthrown in a bloody right-wing military coup by her cousin, General Luis Garc√≠a Meza Tejada. Gueiler then left the country, and lived in France until the fall of the dictatorship in 1982. Later diplomatic and other activities Later, she served her country mostly in the diplomatic sphere, having been appointed Bolivia's ambassador to first Colombia, then West Germany, and finally‚Äîafter joining Jaime Paz's \\"Movimiento de Izquierda Revolucionaria\\"‚Äîto Venezuela (1989). She retired from public life in the mid-1990s. Gueiler was involved in various Bolivian feminist organizations throughout her life. She opposed the United States-backed war on drugs in Latin America, particularly the so-called Plan Colombia. In addition, she authored two books, publishing La mujer y la revoluci√≥n (\\"The woman and the revolution\\") in 1960 and her autobiography, Mi pasi√≥n de lideresa (\\"My passion as a leader\\"), in 2000. She supported the candidacy of Evo Morales in the 2005 election. In June 2009, Gueiler accepted the role of honorary president of the Human Rights Foundation in Bolivia. She is the recipient of several awards, including the Order of the Condor of the Andes Grand Cross and the 1979 United Nations Woman of the Year award. Death On 9 May 2011, Gueiler died in La Paz following a long illness.

Highly publicized and controversial, Born Innocent was the highest-rated television movie to air in the United States in 1974. The movie deals with the physical, psychological and sexual abuse of a teenage girl, and included graphic content never before seen on American television. Plot Christine \\"Chris\\" Parker (Linda Blair) is a 14-year-old runaway who, after getting arrested one too many times, is sentenced to do time in a girls' juvenile detention center, which doubles as a reform school for the girls. It is revealed that Chris comes from an abusive home; her father (Richard Jaeckel) would beat her on a regular basis, which led to her repeated flights from home. Her mother (Kim Hunter) is just as troubled as Chris is; unfeeling, sitting in her recliner, watching television and smoking cigarettes all day, and in complete denial as to what her husband is doing. Only Chris' older brother Tom (Mitch Vogel) is aware of the abuse, but he is powerless to help Chris, as he has his own family to care about and look after. Chris' social worker Emma Lasko (Allyn Ann McLerie) never realizes that her dysfunctional parents are the cause of her troubles, and that the juvenile justice system places the blame for her troubles on Chris herself. With the exception of one dedicated counselor named Barbara Clark (Joanna Miles), the reform school personnel are mostly apathetic and allow an unhealthy, destructive culture to fester in the school. Despite Barbara's attempts to help Christine talk about her problems, she is powerless as Chris refuses to open up to her or anyone else about her problems at home. After a riot results in a beating of a pregnant detainee by abusive staff members, and in her miscarriage, Chris is investigated for causing the riot. She calmly maintains that she had nothing to do with it. In the final shot, Barbara looks on helplessly as she sees Chris, an innocent, intelligent, decent girl, now fully transformed into a violent, pathological, manipulative, vengeful and cold person, devoid of any guilt or remorse for her actions, who will most likely become an adult criminal when released upon turning legal age. Cast * Linda Blair as Chris Parker * Joanna Miles as Counselor Barbara Clark * Allyn Ann McLerie as Emma Lasko * Mary Murphy as Miss Murphy * Janit Baldwin as Denny * Nora Heflin as Moco * Tina Andrews as Josie * Sandra Ego as Janet * Mitch Vogel as Tom Parker * Richard Jaeckel as Mr. Parker * Kim Hunter as Mrs. Parker * Adrienne White as Ria * Janice Lorraine Garcia as Child at funeral Controversy over the rape scene The original cut of Born Innocent contained a scene where several girls, led by Moco (Nora Heflin) and Denny (Janit Baldwin), use a plunger handle to rape Chris in the communal showers. Born Innocent is credited with being one of the catalysts for the National Association of Broadcasters creating a family viewing policy and University of Wisconsin‚ÄìMilwaukee educator Elena Levine has noted that the film was initially advertised in The New York Times alongside the television show Born Free, which she felt may have encouraged viewers to believe the film to be family friendly. The film also made several negative references to lesbianism throughout the film and one version of the script contained a character description of Moco, heavily implying that her lesbianism was a result of her surroundings as well as what prompts her abuse of Chris and others. The film was criticized by the National Organization for Women, the New York Rape Coalition, and numerous gay and lesbian rights organizations for its depiction of female-on-female sexual abuse; the Lesbian Feminist Liberation dismissed the film, stating: \\"Men rape, women don't,\\" and regarded the film as \\"propaganda against lesbians.\\" The shower scene was eventually pulled from the film due to multiple complaints. = Lawsuit over copycat crime = The film was also blamed for the rape of Olivia Niemi, a nine-year-old girl, committed on Baker's Beach, in San Francisco, by some of her peers with a glass soda pop bottle after she was tormented and humiliated with one seven-year-old friend by the band. Valeria Niemi, the victim's mother, basing on the fact the author who held the bottle, Sharon Smith, 15, the only one to have been jailed for the attack, having been sentenced to three years in a federal prison, evoked the movie when she was arrested, and that William Thomas, 14, the boy who provided the bottle, asked if it will be \\"like it was done in the picture\\", sued NBC and asked for damages up to $11 million. Two other girls, 10 and 15, and the boy who served as lookout saw charges dropped. In 1981, the California Supreme Court would declare the film was not obscene, and that the NBC network was not liable for the actions of the persons who committed the crime.Olivia N. v. National Broadcasting Company, 126 Cal. App.3d 488 (1981) = Effect on rape awareness = On the film's impact, Blair has stated that she felt that the movie made it easier for rape survivors to come forward. Post original airings In a response to the incident, re-airings in the late 1970s and 1980s did not air any of the rape sequence. The real-life rape, in part, helped establish the Family Viewing Hour which became briefly mandatory for the networks in the late 1970s, as the movie was aired at 8 to 9pm Eastern Time, when some children may not have been in bed. VHS and DVD release After the edited re-airings in the 1980s, the uncut version appeared on VHS in numerous budget- priced editions. In 2004, VCI Entertainment released Born Innocent on DVD with the rape scene included.

Saying he had failed to qualify by 0.1 sections, he listed his as his \\"biggest regret\\" In 1959, Baylis started his National Service as a physical-training instructor with the Royal Sussex Regiment and swam for the Army and Imperial Services during this time. When he left the army he took a job with Purley Pools, the company which made the first free- standing swimming pools. Initially he worked in a sales role, but later switched to research and development. His swimming skills enabled him to demonstrate the pools and drew the crowds at shows, and this led to forming his own aquatic-display company as professional swimmer, stunt performer and entertainer, performing high dives into a glass-sided tank. With money earned from performing as an underwater-escape artist in the Berlin Circus, he set up Shotline Steel Swimming Pools, a company which supplies swimming pools to schools. Inventing career Baylis's work as a stunt man exposed him to the needs of disabled people, through colleagues whose injuries had ended their performing careers. By 1985, this involvement had led him to invent and develop a range of products for the disabled called Orange Aids. In the late 1980s or early 1990s, Baylis saw a television programme about the spread of AIDS in Africa and realised that a way to halt the spread of the disease would be to educate and disseminate information by radio. Within 30 minutes, he had assembled the first prototype of his most well-known invention, the wind-up radio. The original prototype included a small transistor radio, an electric motor from a toy car, and the clockwork mechanism from a music box. Baylis filed his first patent in 1992.IP Review Online , Interview with Trevor Baylis, January 2008 While the prototype worked well, Baylis struggled to find a production partner. The turning point came in 1994 when his prototype was featured on a film produced by Liz Tucker for the BBC TV programme Tomorrow's World, which resulted in an investor coming forward to back the product.Radio 4 PM Programme \\"Trevor Baylis was the classic British inventor\\". With money from investors he formed a company called Freeplay Energy; in 1996, the Freeplay radio was given the BBC Design Awards for Best Product and Best Design. In the same year Baylis met Queen Elizabeth II and Nelson Mandela at a state banquet, and also travelled to Africa with the Dutch Television Service to produce a documentary about his life. He was awarded the 1996 World Vision Award for Development Initiative that year.Biography of Trevor Baylis, World Vision Award for Development Initiative, World Vision website, January 2006 The year 1997 saw the production in South Africa of the new generation Freeplay radio, a smaller and cheaper model designed for the Western consumer market which uses rechargeable cells with a generic crank generator. During the 1990s, Baylis was also a regular on the Channel 4 breakfast programme, The Big Breakfast. In 2001, Baylis completed a 100-mile walk across the Namib Desert, demonstrating his electric shoes and raising money for the Mines Advisory Group. The \\"electric shoes\\", developed in collaboration with the UK's Defence Evaluation and Research Agency, use piezoelectric contacts in the heels to charge a small battery that can be used to operate a radio transceiver or cellular telephone. Baylis set up the Trevor Baylis Foundation to \\"promote the activity of Invention by encouraging and supporting Inventors and Engineers\\". This led in September 2002 to the formation of the company 'Trevor Baylis Brands PLC' which provided inventors with professional partnership and services to enable them to establish the originality of their ideas, to patent or otherwise protect them, and to get their products to market. The company's primary goal was to secure licence agreements for inventors, but it also considered starting up new companies around good ideas. The company was based in Richmond, London.Baylis wrote the foreword for Kathleen Houston's You Want to Do What?!: 80 Alternative Career Options In 2013 it was reported that the company was financially struggling and was primarily reliant upon Baylis' personal finances to keep itself running.'I've wound up broke despite my inventions', 'Daily Telegraph', 17 February 2013. A few months after his death, Trevor Baylis Brands PLC became insolvent, and in early 2019 it ceased trading.Liquidation notice for Trevor Baylis Brands, 'The London Gazette' 29 March 2019. https://www.thegazette.co.uk/notice/3243544 Personal life For many years, Baylis lived on Eel Pie Island on the river Thames. He regularly attended jazz performances at the Eel Pie Island Hotel. He was a pipe-smoker and in 1999, received the Pipe Smoker of the Year award from the British Pipesmokers' Council. In March 2010, Baylis stated that he was sexually abused at the age of 5 by a Church of England curate. This was also covered in his 1999 autobiography, Clock This. In 2013 it was reported that Baylis was in financial difficulties and was living in relative poverty, having made little money from his wind-up power invention's commercialization, having lost legal control of the product after it had been re-engineered by his corporate partners, and he was relying on a small income as a motivational after-dinner speaker. He died on 5 March 2018 at the age of 80 after a fall on a path on Eel Pie Island, having been afflicted with Crohn's disease in his final years. Upon his death he was unmarried and had no living next-of-kin. A funeral was held at Mortlake Crematorium on 13 March 2018, where his body was cremated in a novelty coffin fashioned as the wind-up radio that he had invented.Obituary for Baylis, Intellectual Property Office Blog, 2 May 2018. https://ipo.blog.gov.uk/2018/05/02/trevor-graham-baylis- cbe-13-may-1937-5-march-2018/ Awards and honours Baylis was appointed an Officer of the Order of the British Empire (OBE) for humanitarian services in the 1997 Birthday Honours, and a Commander of the Order of the British Empire (CBE) in the 2015 New Year Honours for services to intellectual property. Baylis was awarded 11 honorary degrees from UK universities. He received honorary doctorates from Heriot-Watt University in 2003, Leeds Metropolitan University in 2005. and the University of Northampton in 2009.

Tactical lights can be handheld or mounted to the weapon with the light beam parallel to the bore. Tactical lights also serve a role as a method of non-lethal force, used to temporarily blind and disorient targetsThe Martialist: The Magazine For Those Who Fight Unfairly or, in the case of a large metal Maglite with D batteries, police can use the flashlight as a billy club. Features particularly associated with tactical lights include shock resistance, reliability, lightweight construction and powerful, long- lasting batteries, and high light intensity. Tactical lights may have optional filters to produce colored light ,e.g red light, to not attract bugs or be with a diffuser for directing traffic in low light places or night, or may emit only infrared radiation for use with night vision equipment. A sighting laser may also be added to a weapon-mounted tactical light. Handheld lights Handheld lights are generally restricted to use with handguns, as long guns such as rifles and shotguns require two hands to operate. While just about any handheld flashlight can serve in the role of tactical light with the proper technique, some features are more readily adapted to the role. Because the flashlight needs to be reliable and rugged, specialized, more expensive tactical flashlights are generally used by law enforcement officers and soldiers, rather than inexpensive consumer-grade units. Some manufacturers sell lights specifically designed for use as handheld tactical lights. Police training programs in shooting while holding a flashlight date back to at least the 1930s. To use a handheld light as a tactical light, the handgun is held in one hand, and the light in the other. There are a variety of positions that can be used to allow the light and handgun to be held parallel and provide mutual support, or the light can be held off to the side of the body to present a false target to a potential assailant.McGivern, p. 322 Since the weapon and light are not attached to each other, the light may be used to illuminate areas that may or may not contain a target, without pointing the weapon at the area. If a target is detected, the handgun can quickly be brought into line to cover the target.United States Marine Corps Reference Publication 3-01B section 10 A flashlight intended to be used in this way will have provisions for ease of use when used with a handgun. Some models will have a narrow body and a ring designed to fit through the fingers, allowing the light to be used in a tight two handed grip on a handgun, with the switch controlled by pulling back with the fingers on the ring. More traditional models can be used as well. Some flashlights feature a momentary on switch so that the light is quickly turned off by releasing finger pressure on the button. Another useful feature is the ability to attach a lanyard to the light, allowing the light to be secured to the hand holding it; this allows the light to be dropped if the hand is needed (for a magazine change, for example) and quickly retrieved. Police often use large flashlights like the classic D cell Maglite, a sturdy metal unit which, when held correctly, can double as a billy club and as a tactical light. The flashlight is held in the weak hand, with the back of the flashlight extending past the thumb. This allows the light to quickly be reversed, swinging the back end of the light forward to strike the target or block a blow. The strong hand can then be used to draw a sidearm, and place the hands back to back to provide support and illumination in the firing position. Smaller tactical flashlights often have crown-like protrusions around the lens to enable its use as a weapon by hammerfist strike. Weapon-mounted lights Hand-held flashlights were introduced about 1900 with availability of dry cell batteries and incandescent light bulbs. Early bulbs were often too fragile to survive the acceleration of firearm recoil. A United States patent was issued in 1912 for a night sight for firearms demonstrated on a revolver with a bulb mounted in a shock absorber below the barrel and the grip modified to hold a battery and include a pressure switch.Wood, J.B. \\"An Extraordinary Achievement\\" American Rifleman November 2013 pp.74&75 Weapon-mounted lights (sometimes called \\"weaponlights\\") offer hands-free use, leaving the operator free to use both hands to control the weapon. For rifles, two hands are needed to use the weapon. Most models have an on/off switch mounted on a short wire. The switch is then mounted somewhere on the gun within easy reach of the firer's fingers. Weapon-mounted lights are most commonly seen on rifles, shotguns, and submachine guns, but small tactical lights are becoming more common on handguns as well. These lights are often much more expensive than the handheld lights, since they must be sufficiently robust to withstand the recoil of the firearm, and the dedicated mounting hardware also adds to the price. One downside of the weapon-mounted light is that it is always aimed parallel to the bore, so illuminating an object means that it is also targeted. Because of this, weapon-mounted lights may not be appropriate under some rules of engagement. Weapon-mounted lights used to be specific to particular models of firearm, and to some extent that is still true; for example, SureFire makes dedicated lights that replace the forends of the Mossberg 500 and Benelli M3 shotguns, the Heckler & Koch MP5 submachine gun, and the M4 carbine. On the other hand, many modern firearms are incorporating Picatinny rail systems, allowing any appropriately sized Picatinny compatible system to be attached. Other mounting systems are simple clamps, designed to mount most cylindrical lights parallel to the barrel of most firearms. Using an infrared light in conjunction with night vision goggles can mitigate concern about revealing the user, so long as the target lacks night vision. Also partially mitigating this risk associated with a visible light tactical light is the ability of the tactical light user to temporarily disrupt the night vision of the target. For Police S.W.A.T. use, long-range weapon lights with exceptional range have always been a problem. Tactical weapon lighting companies such as ExtremeBeam for example have created small light duty lights which S.W.A.T. officers are able to mount to their modern weapons giving them an extended range out to beyond 300 meters (325+yards). This has allowed officer to blind suspects and protect officers closer at hand from being detected and thereby allowing for a better resolution of the situation with less lethal force. Lighting features Since tactical lights are intended for use in situations where lethal force is likely to be used, reliability is important. =Battery= Flashlight mounted on a rifle.Primary lithium batteries are commonly used with tactical lights, due to the long shelf life, high specific energy, and gradual voltage decay over the battery's lifetime. Alkaline batteries also provide moderately long shelf life and low initial cost. In powerful lights with high current draw, the high internal resistance of alkaline cells results in decreased effective capacity. As the rate of discharge increases, a greater proportion of the cells' power is wasted in its internal resistance. Because of their low internal resistance, lithium batteries are often the primary cell of choice when a high rate of discharge relative to nominal capacity is required. Lithium cells will also provide better performance in cold weather than alkaline cells. High-quality lithium cells are less prone to leakage of electrolyte than alkalines. Rechargeable batteries, such as NiMH and Nicad, are economical options for lights with heavy usage. Rapid capacity loss in comparison to alkaline and lithium batteries limits the use of rechargeable cells to lights in frequent use. With a lithium-ion battery or a low self- discharge NiMH battery, rechargeable battery shelf life is extended. Several new models of tactical flashlights incorporate the ability to be recharged from a USB cable. =Bulb= Bulbs are chosen based on the desired light output and battery life. Generally, high performance bulbs are used, such as xenon bulbs or high power LED lights. LEDs provide maximum battery life due to their energy efficiency, and 2000s technology has greatly increased the light output of LEDs. At one time, xenon bulbs offered the brightest light levels, but recent high-power LEDs are brighter and more efficient than comparable xenon-filled incandescent lamps. Most importantly, LED bulbs are not subject to filament breakage due to the shot recoil of a firearm. Recent advances in high-lux, high-efficiency white LEDs have led to a wave of brighter and more energy-efficient tactical lights. =Illumination types= A micro tactical flashlight mounted below the barrel of a handgun. Tactical lights can be fitted with lenses to produce certain colors, Colored lights or filters provide flexibility for different purposes. Red lights are best for preserving night vision for the law enforcement officer, due to their minimal impact on the rod cells in the eye, while blue light provides high contrast for detecting blood. Light in the infrared spectrum is only visible through night vision devices, allowing the operator to see clearly while reducing the visibility to those not equipped with night vision equipment. Tactical lights are sometimes combined with a laser to form a multifunction unit, able to provide low-light targeting, illumination, or both.

It was originally settled as Sarlesville. The area now known as Millwood appears on 19th century maps as Merritt's Corners (now the intersection of NY 100 and NY 120) and Rockdale Mills (close to what is now the Briarcliff Manor border). As of the 2000 census, the community had a population of 1,210. Miss America 1984 beauty pageant, model, actress and singer Vanessa Williams grew up in Millwood, but lives in New Castle's other hamlet of Chappaqua. Sarles' Tavern, also known as Granite House, was added to the National Register of Historic Places in 1979. Education Most of Millwood lies in the Chappaqua Central School district. Schools include: Elementary - Roaring Brook, Westorchard and Douglas Grafflin; Middle School - Seven Bridges and Robert E. Bell; High School - Horace Greeley.http://www.ccsd.ws/ Most Millwood public school students will go to Westorchard, Seven Bridges, and Horace Greeley. The last group of students who graduated from Bell are seniors during the 2007-2008 school year. Over 94% of Greeley graduates attend 4-year colleges. Infrastructure Millwood had a train station that was originally built by the New York and Putnam Railroad, that later became the Putnam Division of the New York Central Railroad. The last passenger train ran along the Putnam Division in May 1958.http://chappaqua.patch.com/articles/old-millwood-train-station-has-been- demolished Freight service ended in 1962, when the rails were removed after this section had been abandoned. [There was no usable track already by 1970.] Pavement has since taken its place, and it is now a bicycle and pedestrian path, the North County Trailway. The original Millwood station house, built in 1888, burnt to the ground soon after the station was built, and it was replaced by a baggage car. The baggage car remained the station until 1910, when Henry Law built a new station for Briarcliff and the old Briarcliff Manor station was moved to Millwood. This station house was demolished in May 2012.http://railfan.com/extraboard/rf_extra_jun2012.php NY 133 is visible in the background Important highways: Taconic State Parkway (North to Albany, South to Hawthorne), NY Route 100 (North to Somers, South to Yonkers), NY Route 133 (East to Mount Kisco, West to Ossining), NY Route 120 (South to Rye, North end in Millwood). =Fire department= Lightning struck the Millwood railroad station one spring day in 1924 and a blazing fire started. Area residents attempted to put out the fire, but they did not have the equipment or manpower and the Chappaqua fire department was called in to suppress the blaze. To many residents, the railroad fire incident underscored the importance of a quick response to a fire in Millwood. Shortly after the railroad fire, a dozen families met to start the Millwood Fire Company to meet the suppression needs of the community. Land for the Millwood Fire House, located on Route 120, was donated by the Orser family - long-time residents of the area. The founders of the fire company contributed seed money and solicited area residents for donations to build Station #1 and to buy the 1924 Brockway chemical pumper. Much of the labor to build the firehouse was donated by residents, as many were carpenters and tradesmen. In the beginning, firefighters were called to alarms by hammering the bell - still to be seen - in front of Station #1. That system was soon replaced with an air horn which was later replaced with an electronic siren still in use today. In the early days, reporting a fire was done by telephone. When a fire was reported, telephones would ring in ten locations including Station #1, Millwood Shell (which was recently changed back to Millwood Shell after it was an Exxon station), Deems Mobil, and the private homes of the Fire Company officers. Each of these phones was capable of sounding the air horn at Station #1. Today, a caller can dial 911 to report a fire, and firefighters are dispatched by a portable radio paging/alert system and an audible alarm sounds at the firehouse. Pager freq are Westchester county fire control 46.26 for page out and response and 33.96 for paging and firehouse sirens. They also utilize county fire 17 for operations and communications to 60 control and multi- district communication at major fires. The Millwood Fire Company currently houses two locations: Station #1 located on Route 120 and Station #2 located on Route 134. There are approximately 60 volunteers and respond to over 250 alarms a year. The all volunteer company is equipped with seven fire-fighting pieces of equipment: two engines (E-247, E-248), a tanker (T-15), a ladder (L-52 - a quint), a heavy rescue pumper (R-36), a mini-attack (MA-10), and two utility vehicles (U-44, U-145).http://www.millwoodfire.org/content/current/ References Category:Hamlets in Westchester County, New York Category:Hamlets in New York (state) Category:New Castle, New York ","title":"Millwood, New York"},{"id":"1246470","text":"A bust of Theodosius II in the Louvre. The Codex Theodosianus (Eng. Theodosian Code) was a compilation of the laws of the Roman Empire under the Christian emperors since 312. A commission was established by Emperor Theodosius II and his co-emperor Valentinian III on 26 March 429LacusCurtius ‚Ä¢ Roman Law ‚Äî Theodosian Code (Smith's Dictionary, 1875) and the compilation was published by a constitution of 15 February 438. It went into force in the eastern and western parts of the empire on 1 January 439. The original text of the codex is also found in the Breviary of Alaric (also called Lex Romana Visigothorum), promulgated on 2 February 506.  Development  On 26 March 429, Emperor Theodosius II announced to the Senate of Constantinople his intentions to form a committee to codify all of the laws (leges, singular lex) from the reign of Constantine up to Theodosius II and Valentinian III.Peter Stein, pp. 37-38 The laws in the code span from 312 to 438, so by 438 the \\"volume of imperial law had become unmanageable\\".Susan Martin, p. 510 Twenty-two scholars, working in two teams, worked for nine years starting in 429 to assemble what was to become the Theodosian Code.Lenski, pg. 337-340 The chief overseer of the work was Antiochus Chuzon, a lawyer and a prefect and consul from Antioch. Their product was a collection of 16 books containing more than 2,500 constitutions issued between 313 and 437. John F. Matthews illustrated the importance of Theodosius' code when he said, \\"the Theodosian Code was the first occasion since the Twelve Tables on which a Roman government had attempted by public authority to collect and publish its leges.\\"Matthews, p. 17 The code covers political, socioeconomic, cultural and religious subjects of the 4th and 5th centuries in the Roman Empire.Matthews, pg. 10-18 A collection of imperial enactments called the Codex Gregorianus had been written in c. 291-4 and the Codex Hermogenianus, a limited collection of rescripts from c. 295, was published. The Sirmondian Constitutions may also represent a small-scale collection of imperial laws. However, Theodosius desired to create a more comprehensive code that would provide greater insight into law during the later empire (321-429). According to Peter Stein, \\"Theodosius was perturbed at the low state of legal skill in his empire of the East.\\" He apparently started a school of law at Constantinople. In 429 he assigned a commission to collect all imperial constitutions since the time of Constantine. During the process of gathering the vast amount of material, often editors would have multiple copies of the same law. In addition to this, the source material the editors were drawing upon changed over time. Clifford Ando notes that according to Matthews, the editors \\"displayed a reliance on western provincial sources through the late 4th century and on central, eastern archives thereafter.\\"Clifford Ando, p. 200 After six years an initial version was finished in 435, but it was not published, instead it was improved upon and expanded and finally finished in 438 and taken to the Senate in Rome and Constantinople. Matthews believes that the two attempts are not the result of a failed first attempt, but instead the second attempt shows \\"reiteration and refinement of the original goals at a new stage in the editorial process\\".Michael Alexander, p. 191 Others have put forth alternate theories to explain the lengthy editorial process and two different commissions. Boudewijn Sirks believes that \\"the code was compiled from imperial copy books found at Constantinople, Rome, or Ravenna, supplemented by material at a few private collections, and that the delays were caused by such problems as verifying the accuracy of the text and improving the legal coherence of the work.\\"Michael Alexander, p. 191-193 The tone of the work reflected the rhetorical training that the drafters had received and Averil Cameron has described it as \\"verbose, moralizing and pretentious\\".  Context  The code was written in Latin and referred explicitly to the two capitals of Constantinople (Constantinopolitana) and Rome (Roma).Tituli Ex Corpore Codici Theodosiani It was also concerned with the imposition of orthodoxy - the Arian controversy was ongoing - within the Christian religion and contains 65 decrees directed at heretics. Originally, Theodosius had attempted to commission leges generales beginning with Constantine to be used as a supplement for the Codex Gregorianus and the Codex Hermogenianus. He intended to supplement the legal codes with the opinions and writings of ancient Roman jurists, much like the digest found later in Justinian's Code. But the task proved to be too great, and in 435 it was decided to concentrate solely on the laws from Constantine to the time of writing. This decision defined the greatest difference between the Theodosian Code and Justinian's later Corpus Juris Civilis. Matthews observes, \\"The Theodosian Code does, however, differ from the work of Justinian (except the Novellae), in that it was largely based not on existing juristic writings and collections of texts, but on primary sources that had never before been brought together.\\"Matthews, p. 12 Justinian's Code, published about 100 years later, comprised both ius, \\"law as an interpretive discipline\\", and leges, \\"the primary legislation upon which the interpretation was based\\".Matthews, pp. 10-12 While the first part, or codex, of Justinian's Corpus Civilis Juris contained 12 books of constitutions, or imperial laws, the second and third parts, the digest and the Institutiones, contained the ius of Classical Roman jurists and the institutes of Gaius. While the Theodosian Code may seem to lack a personal facet due to the absence of judicial reviews, upon further review the legal code gives insight into Theodosius' motives behind the codification. Lenski quotes Matthews as noting that the \\"imperial constitutions represented not only prescriptive legal formulas but also descriptive pronouncements of an emperor‚Äôs moral and ideological principles\\".Lenski, pg. 331  Christianity  Apart from clearing up confusion and creating a single, simplified and supersedent code, Theodosius II was also attempting to solidify Christianity as the official religion of the Empire, after it had been decriminalised under Galerius' rule and promoted under Constantine's. In his City of God, St. Augustine praised Theodosius the Great, Theodosius II's grandfather, who shared his faith and devotion to its establishment, as \\"a Christian ruler whose piety was expressed by the laws he had issued in favor of the Catholic Church\\".Matthew, p. 8 The Codex Theodosianus is, for example, explicit in ordering that all actions at law should cease during Holy Week, and the doors of all courts of law be closed during those 15 days (1. ii. tit. viii.). It also instituted laws punishing homosexuality, which represented a departure from policy under the period of the Roman Republic, under which homosexuality was tolerated and perhaps mocked but was not illegal.Pharr, 1952: 232-233 The first laws granting tax exemption to the church appear in the Codex and are credited to Constantine and his son Constantius II. These laws specify that all clergy, their family members, and church-owned land was exempt from all compulsory service and tax payments, with the exception that land owned by the clerics themselves was still taxed.  Sources  Books 1-5 lack the level of manuscript support available for books 6-16. The first five books of the surviving Codex draw largely from two other manuscripts. The Turin manuscript, also known as \\"T,\\" consists of 43, largely discontinuous folios.Matthews, pp. 87 The second manuscript is the Breviary of Alaric, and a good part of the Breviarium that is included in book 1 actually contains the original text of the respective part of the original codex. The latter part of the Codex, books 6-16, drew largely from two texts as well. Books 6-8 of the Codex were preserved in the text of a document known as Parsinus 9643.Matthews, pp. 86 The document circulated early medieval French libraries, as well as the other formative document for the latter part of the code, a document held in the Vatican (Vat. Reg. 886), also known as \\"V\\". Scholars consider this section to have been transmitted completely.

The ships were required to carry a similar armament to that of the preceding war-built W-class destroyers (i.e. four 4.7 in (120 mm) guns and six 21 in (533 mm) torpedo tubes) but to have a longer range, at least at cruising speed. A speed of at least was required, and the ships were to be no more than long between perpendiculars (pp).Friedman 2009, pp. 188‚Äì190.English 1993, pp. 7‚Äì8. The winning designs were those from Yarrow and Thornycroft, and orders for one ship each placed in June 1924.English 1993, p. 9. Yarrow's design, which became HMS Ambuscade, was smaller and lighter ( long (pp) and full load displacement) than Thornycroft's ( pp long and full load).Whitley 2000, p. 96. The ship was fitted with Yarrow's distinctive inward sloping stern, which Yarrow claimed increased the ship's speed by up to compared to a conventional V-shaped stern.Friedman 2009, pp. 180, 190. In order to provide the increased fuel economy required by the specification, Ambuscade was fitted three 4-drum Yarrow boilers with air pre- heating, working at a pressure of and 200 ¬∞F (111 ¬∞C) of superheat. These fed geared steam turbines and drove two propeller shafts. The machinery was rated at .Friedman 2009, p. 180.Gardiner and Chesneau 1980, p. 37. The main gun armament of Ambuscade consisted of four 4.7 inch BL Mk I guns. These guns fired a shell to a range of at a rate of about 5‚Äì6 rounds per gun per minute, with 190 shells carried per gun. (Later destroyers were fitted with QF guns firing cased charges and giving a higher rate of fire).Friedman 2009, pp. 180‚Äì181, 298. Anti-aircraft armament consisted of two 2-pounder pom-poms (with 100 rounds per gun) and four Lewis guns. Torpedo armament consisted of the required six 21 inch torpedo tubes, in two triple mounts.Friedman 2009, p. 298. The ship's armament went a number of changes during the Second World War. By April 1941, the aft triple torpedo-tube mount was replaced by a 3-inch (76 mm) anti-aircraft gun.Friedman 2009, p. 241. Further changes included the addition of two Oerlikon 20 mm cannon,Friedman 2009, p. 243. the removal of two 4.7 inch guns (\\"A\\"- and \\"Y\\"-mount), replacement of the ships rangefinder and director with radar, fitting of the Hedgehog anti-submarine mortar and a heavier depth charge outfit. The ship's Hedgehog mount and remaining torpedo tubes were removed when the ship was fitted with two Squid launchers in May 1943. Ambuscade was laid down at Yarrow's Glasgow shipyard on 8 December 1924 and was launched on 14 January 1926.English 1993, p. 100. During speed trials on 2 March 1927, Ambuscade reached an average speed of .English 1993, p. 10. She was commissioned on 9 April 1927. Service Following commissioning, Ambuscade (with the pennant number D38)Friedman 2009, p. 314. joined the Atlantic Fleet for trials, undergoing repair and modifications at Chatham Dockyard between September and November that year, before returning to normal duties. Between April and August 1928, Ambuscade and Amazon were sent on a cruise to South America and the West Indies to evaluate the ships and their machinery in tropical conditions. Both ships encountered problems with high temperatures in their engine rooms, while Ambuscade also suffered from vibration and had a shorter range than specified. In general, Amazons machinery was considered more successful than that of Ambuscade.English 1993, pp. 10‚Äì12. Following her return to the UK, Ambuscade joined the Third Destroyer Flotilla of the Mediterranean Fleet. In August 1929, she was hit by a practice torpedo, damaging her propellers and starboard propeller shaft, requiring repair at Malta until October that year. In January 1930, Ambuscade transferred to the Fourth Destroyer Flotilla, also part of the Mediterranean Fleet. In August, Ambuscade went to Malta for repair again, this time due to problems with the ship's turbines. The repairs continued until March 1931, when Ambuscade returned to the UK and went into reserve at Sheerness.English 1993, p. 12. In June 1932, Ambuscade was taken out of reserve and joined the Home Fleet, serving in Irish waters. In December 1932, Ambuscade was deployed as a Tender to , the torpedo school, being used for training and trials. Ambuscade continued this duty until February 1937, when the poor condition of the ship's turbines resulted in a refit at Portsmouth, with the turbines requiring replacement. Ambuscades refit continued until May 1940, while when she re-entered service with the Sixteenth Destroyer Flotilla based at Harwich, receiving a new pennant number, I38. On 10 June, Ambuscade took part in the attempt to evacuate troops of the 51st (Highland) Division from Saint-Valery- en-Caux (Operation Cycle). Ambuscade was damaged by German shell fire while embarking troops, and on the journey back to Portsmouth, she took the destroyer in tow after the latter was badly damaged by German dive bombers.English 1993, pp. 12, 34. Following repair, Ambuscade rejoined her Flotilla, carrying out anti-invasion patrols and convoy escort operations in July and August 1940, before transferring to the Twelfth Destroyer Flotilla based at Greenock in September, but recurrence of the ship's turbine problems resulted in more repairs from September to November 1940. Ambuscade then rejoined her Flotilla, by then based at Iceland for convoy escort duties. Further mechanical problems, this time with the ship's condensers forced more repair at Portsmouth between October 1941 and January 1942. In March 1942, Ambuscade formed part of the Arctic convoy PQ 14 on its leg from Scotland to Iceland, and for the return convoy QP 9. By this time, it was clear that Ambuscades re-occurring mechanical problems meant that the ship was not fit for convoy escort duties, and Ambuscade was assigned target duties.English 1993, pp. 12‚Äì13. In late 1942, Ambuscade became a trials ship for anti- submarine weapons and sensors, being fitted with the experimental 'Parsnip' anti-submarine mortar in an attempt to provide a more capable ahead-firing anti-submarine weapon than 'Hedgehog'. 'Parsnip' was not a success, and in May 1943, Ambuscade was fitted with the prototype installation of the 'Squid' anti-submarine mortar and its associated depth-finding Type 147 sonar. Trials of Squid were successful, and the weapon was widely fitted in new construction Royal Navy escorts.Brown 2007, pp. 115, 119‚Äì120. Ambuscade continued in use as a trials and training platform until the end of the war in Europe, then going into reserve.English 1993, p. 13. Ambuscade was used for shock trials during 1946, and was sold for scrapping in November that year, being broken up by West of Scotland Shipbreaking Company at Troon from March 1947. Export variant Ambuscade served as the basis for the design by Yarrow of the s which served the Portuguese Navy (Marinha Portuguesa) from 1933 to 1967. Five vessels were ordered by Portugal in 1932. The first two, NRP Douro and Tejo, which were laid down on 9 June 1932, were sold to the Colombian Navy before their 1933 completion. This was in response to the Colombia‚ÄìPeru War. Renamed and Caldas respectively, they served the Colombians as the .Aniversario No.26 del ARC ‚ÄúAntioquia‚Äù, Armada Nacional Rep√∫blica de Colombia. 16 April 2010. Retrieved 9 August 2014. Two further ships were ordered by the Portuguese Navy to replace them. Two of the ships were built at Yarrow's shipyard in Clydebank, Scotland, and the remainder in Lisbon with Yarrow machinery.

It was directed by Paul Weiland and starred Bill Cosby, who also produced the film and wrote its story. The film also starred Gloria Foster as the villain, and Joe Don Baker. The film was shot in the San Francisco Bay Area. It earned several Golden Raspberry Awards; Cosby himself denounced and disowned it in the press in the weeks leading up to its release. It is often considered to be one of the worst films ever made. Plot Bill Cosby plays Leonard Parker, a CIA spy-turned-restaurateur. According to the opening sequence of the movie, the title refers to the idea that this film is actually the sixth installment of a series of films featuring the adventures of Leonard, as parts one through five were locked up in the interests of world security. In actuality, there are no films preceding this one. The theatrical release poster points out that Leonard Parker is, at the time of his reluctant return to action, coping with domestic issues: The film starts with Parker being called out of retirement by his CIA director Snyderburn (Baker) to save the world from evil vegetarian Medusa Johnson (Foster), who brainwashes animals to kill people. The film ends with Leonard infiltrating Johnson's headquarters (an \\"International Tuna\\" factory), fending off the vegetarians with magic meat he received from a Gypsy, freeing the captive animals, and flooding the base using Alka-Seltzer. He escapes by riding an ostrich across the roof; the unlikely steed flies him to the ground.

He said he thought to himself \\"Man, there's got to be a place for a hero who has to deal with a heavy who's got a bigger gun than he has.\\" Cosby described the lead as a \\"high-tech comic-book character.\\" He said \\"I've put stuff in here for the women, I've put stuff in here for the kids.\\"Bill Cosby makes the most of 50: [CITY Edition] Waters, Harry F. St. Petersburg Times 22 Sep 1987: 1D. Asked years later about his work on the film, director Paul Weiland recalled: Reception The movie received overwhelming negative reviews. When the film was released in 1987, even Cosby himself said that he was so disappointed with it that he publicly advised people not to waste their money on it. Roger Ebert called it \\"one of the worst movies of the year\\" and strongly criticized the obvious Coca-Cola product placement, saying that Cosby \\"ought to be ashamed of himself.\\"Siskel & Ebert.

It was nominated for two more Razzie Awards, for Worst Supporting Actress (Foster) and Worst Director (Weiland). A few weeks after the ceremony, Cosby accepted his three Razzies on Fox's The Late Show. He demanded that the three Razzies he earned be specifically made out of 24 karat (99.99%) gold and Italian marble, which were later paid for by Fox. Cosby later brought the awards with him when he was a guest on The Tonight Show Starring Johnny Carson, happily displaying them and proclaiming, \\"I swept the awards!\\" For the 2005 Razzies, the movie earned a nomination in the Worst \\"Comedy\\" of Our First 25 Years category, losing to Gigli.

It was built at Cincinnati, Ohio in 1854. It served as a commercial steamer until purchased by Colonel Charles Ellet Jr. in 1862 and converted for use as a ram ship. The ship operated in conjunction with the Mississippi River Squadron during the Union brown-water navy battle against the Confederate River Defense Fleet for control of the Mississippi River and its tributaries during the American Civil War. The ship played a critical role in the Union Navy victory at the First Battle of Memphis and sank the Confederate flagship CSS Colonel Lovell. In actions south of Vicksburg, Mississippi, she severely damaged the CSS City of Vicksburg and captured four transport ships supplying Confederate forces. On February 14, 1863, the USS Queen of the West was captured by Confederate forces on the Red River, repaired and returned to service as the CSS Queen of the West. Together with the CSS Webb, it was used to force the surrender of the USS Indianola on the Mississippi River. On April 11, 1863, she was attacked and destroyed on the Atchafalaya River by the USS Estrella, USS Calhoun and USS Arizona. Service as USS Queen of the West An engraving from Harper's Weekly depicting several of the United States Ram Fleet ships. The Queen of the West is second from the front with the large \\"Q\\" between the smoke stacks The Queen of the West was built in Cincinnati, Ohio in 1854 and served as a commercial steamer. She was purchased by Charles Ellet, Jr. in 1862 due to her speed and converted for usage as a ram ship. The hull was reinforced, the forward end filled with hard oak wood, the steam-engine secured and the pilot house protected by thick wooden planks. Three longitudinal bulkheads were added and supported with iron bars. A central beam was installed from bow to stern and iron peaks were installed on the bow. A large ornamental \\"Q\\" was installed in the support cables between the twin chimney stacks. She was originally not equipped with any guns. The Queen of the West was designated as Colonel Ellet's flagship of the United States Ram Fleet. On May 25, the Queen of the West and the ram fleet joined the Mississippi River Squadron, led by Charles H. Davis, on the Mississippi River north of Fort Pillow. Davis had little faith in the effectiveness of the rams but allowed the fleet to accompany his gunboats down the river to Memphis. =First Battle of Memphis= The Queen of the West sank the Confederate flagship CSS Colonel Lovell at the First Battle of Memphis On June 6, Colonel Charles Ellet, Jr. led the ram ships in the Battle of Memphis as captain of the Queen of the West. Ellet had not coordinated a plan of attack with Davis and when the flotilla approached Confederate forces, the Queen of the West and the USS Monarch steamed ahead of Davis' gunboats. The Queen of the West rammed and sank the Confederate flagship . After the collision, the Queen of the West came under attack from the CSS Sumter and the CSS Beauregard. The attack sheared off one of the paddle wheels from the Queen of the West and forced her to ground on the riverbank. Ellet was wounded in the knee by a Confederate sharpshooter during the battle. His wound was the only serious casualty received on the Union side during the battle. Ellet died 15 days from a blood infection due to the injury. Ellet's brother, Alfred W. Ellet took command of the ram fleet and his son Charles Rivers Ellet became captain of the Queen of the West. =Actions near Vicksburg= On July 15, the Queen of the West, , and engaged the Confederate ironclad ram in the Yazoo River. The Arkansas was heavily damaged but escaped into the Mississippi and took refuge under the Confederate batteries at Vicksburg, Mississippi. On July 22, Queen of the West and attacked Arkansas, despite the batteries at Vicksburg. The Queen of the West rammed the Arkansas but inflicted only minor damage and rejoined the Mississippi River Squadron ships above Vicksburg. The Queen of the West continued to support operations against Vicksburg. On September 19, while escorting two transport barges, the Queen of the West had a short engagement with Confederate infantry and artillery on the Mississippi River above Bolivar, Mississippi. The Queen of the West also conducted operations in the Yazoo River clearing mines and engaging Confederate batteries. In November 1862, the Mississippi Marine Brigade, an amphibious raiding unit, was organized by Alfred W. Ellet. The ram fleet including the Queen of the West was incorporated as a part of the brigade. On November 5, Charles Rivers Ellet was promoted to the rank of colonel and assigned command of the ram fleet. On December 12, 1862, the Queen of the West was one of the ships that accompanied the USS Cairo up the Yazoo River. The Cairo was struck by a 'torpedo' or naval mine and began to sink rapidly. The Queen of the West was able to rescue part of the crew from the Cairo before it sank. On February 2, 1863, Charles Rivers Ellet was ordered by Admiral David Dixon Porter to run the Queen of the West past the batteries at Vicksburg, Mississippi to support Admiral David Farragut below the city. The boat was equipped with a 30-pounder bow gun, three 12-pounder howitzers, cotton bales and wooden sheathing for protection. Ellet intended to \\"run the gauntlet\\" of Vicksburg by cover of night, however delays resulted in passage of the guns at daybreak. The guns at Vicksburg fired for 50 minutes straight. The Queen of the West took 12 hits and lost a gun but made it past the batteries with minimal damage. The run provided the Union forces with insight as to where the guns at Vicksburg were positioned. The Queen of the West rammed the CSS City of Vicksburg and set her ablaze with turpentine soaked balls fired from the forward gun Once past the batteries, the Queen of the West found the City of Vicksburg docked, rammed her and set her ablaze with turpentine soaked balls fired from the forward gun.. The City of Vicksburg was severely damaged but not destroyed. The Queen of the West had to disengage before destroying the City of Vicksburg due to enemy fire which set the cotton bales aboard the Queen of the West ablaze. The Union forces supplied the Queen of the West with fuel by floating an unmanned coal barge filled with 20,000 bushels of coal past the Vicksburg batteries at night. The barge went unnoticed by the Confederate forces and floated downriver 10 miles before being intercepted by the Queen of the West. The barge provided the Queen of the West with enough fuel to continue her mission. On February 3, the Queen of the West captured three Confederate transport ships - the CSS A.W. Baker, CSS Moro and CSS Berwick Bay. The Moro was empty of cargo since it had just dropped off supplies at Port Hudson, Louisiana. The other two ships were laden with food supplies headed toward Vicksburg. The Queen of the West rendezvoused with the De Soto and on February 12, both ships went down the Atchafalaya River to Simmesport, Louisiana in search of Confederate forces. The crew went ashore, destroyed all supplies found and looted the residential area. On the way back up the Mississippi River, the Queen of the West received Confederate gun fire and the 1st mate was injured. In retaliation, Ellet and his crew burned three plantations that were believed to be the residences of those that injured the 1st mate. =Loss of the Queen of the West= The Queen of the West was captured by Confederate forces on the Red River near Fort DeRussy On February 14, the Queen of the West and De Soto went up the Red River and captured the steamboat Era No. 5 carrying 4,500 bushels of corn. The Queen of the West continued upstream to investigate reports of steamships at Gordon's Landing near Marksville, Louisiana. She came under heavy fire by the shore batteries of Fort DeRussy and was run aground onto the right bank by her pilot instead of backing down river as ordered. She was directly in the sight of Confederate guns, which pounded her until Ellet ordered \\"abandon ship,\\". Ellet and the crew escaped and floated downstream on bales of cotton and were rescued by the De Soto. The Queen of the West was not burned out of concern for the 1st mate who was wounded and could not be moved. The USS Queen of the West was captured, repaired and re-entered into service as the CSS Queen of the West by the Confederate forces.

Background Clarence (often called \\"Walt\\") Lillehei was born in Minneapolis, Minnesota, the son of Dr. Clarence Ingvald Lillehei (1892-1973) and Elizabeth Lillian (Walton) Lillehei (1891-1973). He attended West High School in Minneapolis in 1935. He attended the University of Minnesota at the age of 17. He earned 4 degrees at the University of Minnesota, including his B.S. (with distinction) in 1939, his M.D. (Alpha Omega Alpha) in 1942, his M.S. in physiology in 1951, and his Ph.D. in surgery in 1951.C. Walton Lillehei (Minnesota Historical Society) 1920 Federal Census(Heritage Quest Online) Career In 1944, Alfred Blalock at Johns Hopkins University Hospital had begun successfully performing surgery on the great vessels around the heart to relieve the symptoms of tetralogy of Fallot, demonstrating that heart surgery could be possible. Lillehei participated in the first successful surgical repair of the heart on 2 September 1952. That historic operation, using hypothermia, was led by his longtime friend and colleague, F. John Lewis. Lillehei was a professor in the Department of Surgery at the University of Minnesota from 1951 to 1967. However, hypothermia, gave only a relatively brief time, up to 10 minutes, during which surgery could be performed and was therefore not suited for complex congenital defects within the heart. To resolve this problem, Lillehei performed operations using cross-circulation, in which a donor was hooked up nearby to take up the pumping and oxygenation functions of the patient who was being operated on. Using this technique, Lillehei led the team that performed successful repair of a ventricular septal defect on March 26, 1954. Although the repair was successful, the patient, 13-month-old Gregory Glidden, died 11 days later of suspected pneumonia. Lillehei and his team continued to use cross-circulation for a total of 44 open-heart operations in the following year, of which 32 patients survived. These operations included the first repairs of the atrioventricular canal and tetralogy of Fallot. In July of that year, a successful operation was performed on patient Michael Eugene Shaw of Litchfield, Minnesota.Dr. C. Walton Lillehei (Vincent L. Gott, M.D. Johns Hopkins Medical Institutions.Baltimore, MD) Lillehei cooperated with Professor Moshe Gueron and Professor Morris J. Levy, who were both considered among \\"The Cardiology Founders of Israel\\" by doing the first cardiac puncture catheterization, which was used on 80 patients in 1964.Cardiac Puncture Catheterization (Morris J. Levy and C. Walton Lillehei) In 1958, Lillehei was responsible for the world's first use of a small, external, portable, battery-powered pacemaker. It was invented at his behest by Earl Bakken, whose then-small company, Medtronic, designed and repaired electronics for the University of Minnesota hospital. After the introduction of the first widely used prosthetic heart valves by Albert Starr in 1961, Lillehei also developed and implanted several innovative designs: the Lillehei-Nakib toroidal disc (1966), the Lillehei-Kaster pivoting disc (1967), and the Kalke-Lillehei rigid bileaflet prosthesis (1968). As a dedicated educator, Lillehei trained more than 150 cardiac surgeons from 40 nations, including Norman Shumway and Christiaan Barnard, who formed half of the quartet which pioneered heart transplantation (the others being Richard Lower and Adrian Kantrowitz).McRae, Donald (2007) Every Second Counts: The Race to Transplant the First Human Heart (Berkley Trade) In 1967, he was appointed Lewis Atterbury Stimson professor and chairman of the surgery department at Cornell Medical Center, New York. He returned to St. Paul, Minnesota, in 1975, where he became the director of medical affairs at St. Jude Medical. He was also named a clinical professor in the Department of Surgery at the University of Minnesota.C. Walton Lillehei, the Father of Open Heart Surgery (Denton A. Cooley, MD. Texas Heart Institute. Houston, Texas) Honors Lillehei's honors include the Bronze Star for World War II service in Italy, the 1955 Lasker Award, the Order of Health Merit Jose Fernandez Madrid by the government of Colombia in 1959, the Golden Plate Award of the American Academy of Achievement in 1968, induction in 1993 into the Minnesota Inventors Hall of Fame, and the 1996 Harvey Prize in Science and Technology. In 1966-67, he served as president of the American College of Cardiology. Personal life In 1946, Dr. Lillehei was married to Katherine Ruth (Lindberg) Lillehei (1921-2012) with whom he had four children. Following his death in 1999, he was buried at the Fort Snelling National Cemetery. His youngest brother, Richard C. Lillehei, was a notable transplant surgeon in his own right, having participated in the world's first successful transplant of a pancreas in 1966 and the first known human transplant of the small and large intestines.History of Richard C.

The company's flagship brand is Hobgoblin, a 5.2% abv brown ale. Wychwood Brewery produces around 50,000 barrels (8,200,000 litres) of cask ale each year, and is the United Kingdom's largest brewer of organic ales. Wychwood filtered and bottled beers are exported all over the world, including North America, Germany, Sweden, France, Australia, Russia, Japan, Israel and Singapore. The brewery is known for its character-based label artwork, inspired by the myths and legends surrounding the ancient Wychwood Forest.  History  Hobgoblin being enjoyed by Prime Minister David Cameron with President Barack Obama at the G20 Summit in Toronto 2010 The brewery is sited at the old Eagle Maltings, built in 1841 to malt barley for Clinch's brewery which had an estate of seventy-one pubs in Southern England. In 1961, Courage bought Clinch's for its pub estate and closed down the brewery. In 1983, part of the original Clinch's Eagle Brewery site was rented by Paddy Glenny, but named the brewing company Glenny Brewery. Chris Moss took his interest in exchange for a debt from Paddy and took over after Paddy Glenny moved away. In 1990, the Eagle was renamed the Wychwood Brewery after the ancient Wychwood Forest which borders Witney, at the same time the brewery moved to the Two Rivers Industrial estate still in Witney. In 1994 the brewery was moved back to the site taking on more of the old site. The brewery was taken over in 2002 by Refresh UK, a subsidiary of Marston's. Marston's then bought Refresh and Wychwood Brewery outright in 2008. Beers flagship beer, Hobgoblin A bottle of Circle Master beer, before its re-branding as Scarecrow =Hobgoblin= Hobgoblin is the best-known and most popular beer brewed at Wychwood Brewery and was created by Chris Moss.

Jeremy Moss, Wychwood's head brewer, describes the drink as \\"full bodied and well balanced with a chocolate toffee malt flavour, moderate bitterness and a distinctive fruity character with a ruby red glow\\". It was the first bottled beer in the UK to feature an illustrated label, as opposed to a simple text-based one, and it is currently the 2nd best-selling bottled ale in the UK. During a meeting at the 2010 G-20 Toronto summit, Prime Minister David Cameron and President Barack Obama gave each other bottles of beer from their respective home towns/cities, with Cameron presenting Obama with twelve bottles of Hobgoblin, which is brewed in his Witney constituency. In return Obama gave Cameron 24 bottles of Goose Island beer, from Goose Island Brewery. The President remarked that he would drink his beer chilled, as opposed to the optimal room temperature (15.5 ¬∞C/59.9 ¬∞F) at which strong ale should be drunk, prompting Wychwood to create a T-shirt in their online store reading \\"What's the matter Obama, afraid you might taste something?\\".Wychwood Online Gift Shop =King Goblin= King Goblin, essentially a stronger and more flavourful variety of Hobgoblin, is a 6.6% abv \\"Special Reserve\\" ale.King Goblin Beer ‚Äì Beer profile at Wychwood.co.uk To date it is available bottled in Asda, Morrisons and Tesco supermarkets, Draeger's supermarkets in the US, in \\"Broken English\\" shops in Berlin, and on draught during \\"real ale\\" festivals at Wetherspoons pubs.  Brakspear  Wychwood took over the brewing of the newly acquired Brakspear beers in October 2002. The new Brakspear brewery was integrated into an expansion of the Wychwood plant, and includes parts of the copper (boiling vessel), as well as some of the fermenting vessels which themselves had been refurbished at Henley. There is only one brewhouse at Witney but two separate fermenting rooms for the separate Wychwood and Brakspear beers. The Brakspear beers are still brewed in Witney by Wychwood and not in Henley, where the original brewery site has been converted into a boutique hotel.

In traditional culture The Baykok is a character from the Anishinaabe aadizookaan (traditional stories). It is said to fly through the forests of the Great Lakes region. The cries of Baykok are also described as being shrill. Described as \\"Death\\" in The Song of Hiawatha, it is said to appear as an extremely emaciated skeleton-like figure, with thin translucent skin and glowing red points for eyes. The Baykok only preys upon warriors, but does so ruthlessly, using invisible arrows or beating its prey to death with a club. The Baykok, after paralyzing or killing its prey, then devours the liver of its victim. Baykok was also said to approach a sleeping hunter, gently cut an opening in the chest and remove a piece of the stomach, without waking the victim. The word bakaak in the Anishinaabe language means \\"skeleton\\" in the sense of \\"bones draped in skin\\" rather than \\"bare-bones\\", such that it lends itself to words like bakaakadozo, meaning \\"to be thin/skinny/poor\\", and bakaakadwengwe, meaning \\"to have a lean/thin face\\". The name Bakaak occasionally appears as Bekaak (reflected in English as \\"Baykok\\"), which may be a shortening of bekaakadwaabewizid, meaning \\"an extremely thin being\\". The description of Bakaak's shrill cries (bagakwewewin, literally meaning \\"clear/distinct cries\\") is a pun of its name. The method the Bakaak uses to subdue its victim is another pun of its name: the word for \\"to beat using a club\\" is baagaakwaa'ige. A similar construct is found in the name for the basketry splints called baagaako'igan, prepared by pounding black ash. Yet another pun on the name is the way the Bakaak \\"flings its victim's chest open\\" (baakaakwaakiganezh) to devour the victim's liver. In popular culture First introduced to the non-Anishinaabe public through The Song of Hiawatha, the baykok is occasionally referenced in modern fiction. Elliot James' novel Daring features a bakaak which hunts werewolves. The Baykok also appears in the Japanese franchise of role-playing games Megami Tensei, in the first two installments of the Shin Megami Tensei series as a demon enemy.
