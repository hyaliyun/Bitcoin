Von Bagh worked as the head of the Finnish Film Archive. He was the editor-in-chief of Filmihullu magazine and co-founder and director of the Midnight Sun Film Festival. Since 2001, he had been the artistic director of the film festival Il Cinema Ritrovato in Bologna. Von Bagh was a member of the jury in the competition category of 2004 Cannes Film Festival. Films directed by Peter von Bagh are screened at prestigious international forums, including an extensive retrospective of his works at the Rotterdam International Film Festival and Festival Internacional de Cine Independente in Buenos Aires in 2012, and at the Troms√∏ International Film Festival in 2013. Principal works of Peter von Bagh's production of approximately 40 non-fiction books, mostly on cinema, and some 60 films for both the cinemas and television include his internationally successful films Helsinki, Forever (2008) and Sodankyl√§, Forever (2010‚Äì2011, a documentary series of the first twenty-five years of the Midnight Sun Film Festival), Song of Finland (\\"The Story of Art in Finland During the Era of Independence\\", a twelve-episode television series, YLE 2003‚Äì04, and a book published by WSOY 2007), Elokuvan historia (\\"History of Cinema\\", a 52-episode radio series, YLE and a book published by W&G; 1975, Otava 1998, 2004) and T√§htien kirja (\\"The Book of Stars\\", Otava, 2006). The book Aki Kaurism√§ki has been translated into several languages. He died in 2014 at the age of 71.Midnight Sun film festival director Peter von Bagh passes, YLE News, 22 September 2014  Studies  Born to a German Russian psychiatrist father,Tervo, Jukka: Ket√§ rakastamme kun rakastamme Elvist√§ Konradin kovan kuoren alle Kaleva Von Bagh graduated from the Oulun lyseo Upper Secondary School in 1961. He took his Master of Arts degree at University of Helsinki in 1970 with a combination of subjects consisting of Theoretical Philosophy, Sociology, Aesthetics, and Literature. His dissertation Elokuvalliset keinot ja niiden k√§ytt√∂: Alfred Hitchcockin Vertigo was later published as a book (Helsingin yliopisto, 1979). Von Bagh took his degree of Doctor of Social Sciences in 2002. His doctoral thesis Peili jolla oli muisti ‚Äì elokuvallinen kollaasi kadonneen ajan merkityksien hahmottajana (1895‚Äì1970), (SKS 2002) examines the fundamental units of cinematic expression, montage and collage. Von Bagh has taught and lectured at several schools and universities, e.g. as Professor of Film History at Aalto University since 2001. He has also compiled a textbook on cinema, Salainen muisti (Sanoma Pro, 2009), to be used in schools. The connecting thought in Peter von Bagh's production is the history of everyday Finnish life: images of details conveying something of what the life of the Finns has been like. The films Vuosi 1952 (\\"The Year 1952\\", 1980), Viimeinen kes√§ 1944 (\\"The Last Summer 1944\\", 1992), Helsinki, Forever (2008) and Splinters ‚Äì A Century Of An Artistic Family (2011) provide a magnifying glass for peeking at history, defined by a certain moment in time, location, or an artistic family. In a Letter to the Director published in the Pordenone Silent Film Festival catalogue 2008, Chris Marker wrote about von Bagh's film Helsinki, Forever: \\"'Few movies may boast a stronger opening sequence, and few movies offer such an extraordinary finale. And in-between I guess what I admire most is the fluidity of the editing, your way to play with time in a manner that comes at once as always surprising and perfectly natural. HELSINKI deserves its rank among the great \\"city-poems\\", and I'd rate it above Ruttmann, for instance, for one reason: if I read in his BERLIN the social commitment and the aesthetic maestria, I don't feel the personal acquaintance with the city, its history, its ghosts, that I found in yours. Also something that many have a tendency to underestimate but which for me is crucial: the music. The Zeppelin sequence by itself carries a haunting beauty, akin to Fellini's liner, but I don't think it would attain this climax of emotion if at that moment the music didn't bring the perfect tune of melancholia. So with the choice of incredible documents and the unfailing mixture of both musical items, editing and score, you made an unforgettable film.\\" Von Bagh made dozens of films for television, including portraits of prominent Finns from different fields (Tapio Rautavaara in Tapsa ‚Äì Slashes from a Rover's Life, 1980; Paavo Nurmi, 1978; Otto Ville Kuusinen in Mies varjossa, 1994), musicians (Olavi Virta, 1972; Suomi Pop, 1984), actors (Tauno Palo, 1981) and film directors (Edvin Laine, 2006; Mikko Niskanen, 2010). Von Bagh's fiction films are often documentary in their own way: the main character of The Count (1971) is Pertti Ylermi Lindgren, a con man elevated to nobility by the tabloid papers. Pockpicket (1968) is a variation on Robert Bresson's Pickpocket (1959). In it, an estranged young man attempts to instil tension into his life by slipping banknotes into the wallets of the city-dwellers. As a scriptwriter, Von Bagh has participated in the making of Risto Jarva's Time of Roses (1969), Rally (1970) and When the Heavens Fall.. (1972).  Literary production  Von Bagh's literary production includes almost 40 books of non-fiction. In 2007, von Bagh received the Ministry of Education and Culture, Finland's State Award for Public Information for a Lifetime Achievement. The same year his book Song of Finland was awarded The Finlandia Literary Prize for Non-Fiction. He has received the State Award for Public Information twice, in 1986 for Iskelm√§n kultainen kirja (\\"Golden Book of Finnish Pop Songs\\" co-author Ilpo Hakasalo) and in 1975 for Elokuvan historia (\\"History of Cinema\\". In 1992 The Finnish Literature Society SKS presented him with the SKS Elias L√∂nnroth Award for Suomalaisen elokuvan kultainen kirja (Golden Book of Finnish Cinema\\"). Von Bagh's essays and articles have been published in several film books and magazines both in Finland and abroad. The most famous of these are the French L'√âcran, Cahiers du cin√©ma, Trafic and Cinema 02, the Italian Cinegrafie, the Spanish Nosferatu, the Swedish Chaplin, the British Movie, etc. Up until his death Peter von Bagh worked as the editor-in-chief of Filmihullu, the magazine he founded in 1968. Abroad, von Bagh worked as a cinema expert for the French non-fiction publishing house Larousse in 2009, and as a permanent contributing editor of the Italian Einaudi publishing company. = Love kirjat = Peter von Bagh was also active promoter of literature in his native country, working as an editor and preface writer for the Love kirjat publishing company during 1977‚Äì1996. The titles published by Love kirjat, more than one hundred, include translations of world literature classics from Aiskhylos (Oresteia, Love 1991) to Balzac (Lost Illusions, Love 1983, The Splendors and Miseries of Courtesans', Love 1991), from Jack London (The Iron Heel, Love 1977) to August Strindberg (Pieni katekismus, Love 1981), to poetry (e.g. Matti Rossi), essayism (e.g. Raoul Palmgren) and detective stories (James Cain: Double Indemnity, Love 1982), literature research (Gy√∂rgy Luk√°cs Balzac ja ranskalainen realismi, Love 1978), not forgetting economics, military history, and Sigmund Freud The Joke and Its Relation to the Unconscious, Love 1983). Love kirjat has also brought several fundamental works of film literature to the Finnish readers, e.g. Andr√© Bazin's essays (Love 1981, 1990), Sergei Eisenstein's Film Form: Essays in Film Theory (Love, 1978); Federico Fellini's Fellini on Fellini (Love, 1980) and Giulietta (Love, 1990); Jean Renoir's My Life And My Films (Love, 1980), for which Peter von Bagh has written a preface. Other important Love translations are Elokuva Godardin mukaan, a collection of film criticism by Jean-Luc Godard, translated into Finnish by Sakari Toiviainen (Love, 1984), and Fran√ßois Truffaut's The Films in My Life (Love, 1982). Besides film literature, Love also published elemental work of other art forms, e.g. Meyerhold's A Revolution in Theatre (Love, 1981) and Hanns Eisler's essays on music (Love, 1980).  Festival directorships  The Midnight Sun Film Festival was founded in 1986 on the initiative of Anssi M√§ntt√§ri. In addition to M√§ntt√§ri, the Festival policy and guidelines were created by Kaurism√§ki brothers, Mika and Aki Kaurism√§ki and Peter von Bagh. The key elements of this festival of the midnight sun are the magical light of the North, and the film screenings. Contrary to the glittering award forums, the Midnight Sun Film Festival does not look for glamour. Instead, the main role is given to the films. The programming includes both classics and forward-looking works from the world over. They are presented in their original format, the silent films accompanied by live music. The two-hour morning discussions, hosted by Peter von Bagh throughout the Festival's history, are internationally unique items. From discussions with hundreds of guests, Peter von Bagh has selected the best elements for his book Sodankyl√§, Forever (WSOY, 2010) and a four-part documentary series of the same name. The series has garnered extensive praise at the world's film forums, e.g. at Lincoln Center in New York in August 2011 when Nico Baumbach wrote in Film Comment (Sept/Oct 2011): \\"\\"Von Bagh's four-part series is a wise and generous act of preservation. Assembled largely from interviews with directors conducted over a 25-year period at the Midnight Sun Film Festival he runs in the tiny Finnish municipality of Sodankyl√§, the film does a double duty as a celebration of the festival itself and as a veritable history of cinema and the 20th century. As von Bagh explains, the life of cinema is short enough \\"that a small festival far up north can span it completely.\\" One of the questions addressed to all guests ‚Äì \\"What was the first film you saw?\\" ‚Äì becomes a way to extend the story of the festival back to the silent era, because a \\"festival is as deep as the memory it contains.\\"\\" The Midnight Sun Film Festival guest list included e.g. the French Chris Marker, Jean Rouch, Jean-Pierre Gorin, Jean-Pierre L√©aud, Claude Chabrol, Jacques Demy, Agn√®s Varda, Robert Gu√©diguian and the brothers Pierre and Luc Dardenne, the Iranian Jafar Panahi, Abbas Kiarostami and Samira Makhmalbaf, the Hungarian Istv√°n Szab√≥, Mikl√≥s Jancs√≥ and B√©la Tarr, the Polish Krzysztof Kieslowski, Agnieszka Holland, Jerzy Kawalerowicz and Krzysztof Zanussi, the Czech Ivan Passer and Milo≈° Forman, the Russian Marlen Khutsiev, Andrei Konchalovsky, Alexei German, Andrei Smirnov.

Dusan Makavejev and Emir Kusturica from former Yugoslavia, and during the first year, Michael Powell from the United Kingdom. In addition, the festival has had the privilege of being able to listen to major film writers like JoƒÅo B√©nard da Costa, Jim Hoberman, Jean Douchet, Bernard Eisenschitz and Olaf M√∂ller. From 2001 Peter von Bagh worked as the Artistic Director of Il Cinema Ritrovato Festival in Bologna. The Festival specializes in \\"recovered\\" treasures, previously believed lost or unknown, silent films and restored prints. The screen annually erected in Piazza Maggiore in Bologna at the turn of June/July attracts an audience of thousands of spectators. The Festival audience includes both local cinephiles and international specialists of the field. Von Bagh also acted as an Artistic Expert for San Sebasti√°n International Film Festival in 2009, the Visiting Artistic Director of the Telluride Film Festival in 1997, and as a member of the Cannes Film Festival Competition section in 2004.  Film archives  Peter von Bagh worked as the Executive Director of the Finnish Film Archive in 1966‚Äì1969, and as the Programme Planner until 1984. During that period, the Archive's programming gained its present esteemed reputation, and the number of screenings proliferated. In the speech von Bagh gave at the FIAF (International Federation of Film Archives) conference in Lisbon in 1989 he emphasized: \\"When I started the Archive offered only two screenings per week. I immediately increased the number of screenings to four. Soon we managed to screen eight films each week. A few years passed this way, and when the confidence of the audience had solidified, we began to screen three films a day.\\" It was a golden era for the cinemas in Helsinki. An example: \\"In the 1970s Bresson's films brought in more money in Helsinki than in Paris.\\" Peter von Bagh continues: \\"Many archives have fallen for easy baits and an emphasis on fashionable films. That is the best way to lose an audience whose confidence can only be won through a patient building process. Officials equipped with short-sighted calculations may find it difficult to understand why a small archive would order a rare film from a distant country for one screening only. Calculations like this easily paralyzes socio-cultural activities altogether. The discrepancy hangs in the air, written in fiery letters: the audience seems to be drooling after de Palma and Eastwood, although an inner voice calls you to screen bodies of works scrutinizing the output of Victor Sj√∂str√∂m and Carl Th. Dreyer... The first screening of Victor Sj√∂str√∂m or Carl Th. Dreyer might bring in fifteen people, but after five years and some more efforts there will be a full house. The preservation prints of an early Yevgeni Bauer film, or Maurice Tourneur's The Wishing Ring (which would be almost nothing in 16 mm or in video) will look just miraculous to any public that comes in ‚Äì and there will be one once you build a place where everyone can trust that miracles take place, almost on daily basis. --. In the beginning a film maybe a complete unknown but the visiting card it leaves behind remains forever: a wonderful beauty.\\" In the same speech, von Bagh defines the responsibilities of the archives: preservation of a confidential relationship with the audience, protection and restoration of the classics, and especially domestic films, and supportto film clubs as a common film bank which makes the screenings possible.

The Texan industrialist father of newly arrived characters Clint and Bo Buchanan, Asa was originated in late 1979 by Philip Carey. Carey portrayed the role continually for nearly three decades, through to his final pre-taped appearance in 2008. Throughout those years, Asa's ruthless business dealings and attempts to both protect and control his family members drive much of the drama in the series. Casting Actor Philip Carey portrayed patriarch Asa as a contract player for over 27 years from the character's on-screen inception in December 1979, after which he turned down the show's offer to play the character in a supporting capacity in 2007; he made his final regular appearance as Asa on the episode first-run April 26, 2007. The character subsequently died offscreen in August 2007, coinciding with the series' 10,000th episode celebration, which brought back characters from the show's past to attend the funeral. In November 2007, Carey briefly reprised the role for three episodes in Asa's videotaped will, airing November 9 to November 13, 2007. On July 16, 2008, Carey appeared as Asa's ghost,One Life to Live recap (7/16/08) - ABC.com and also returned on July 21, 2008, for the series' 40th anniversary, as character Viki Davidson visits Heaven.One Life to Live recap (7/21/08, 40th Anniversary) - Soaps.com Beginning in the same episode, Robert S. Woods appears as a young Asa in a storyline in which the characters Bo and Rex find themselves in 1968. Carey returned on August 19, 2008 as Asa's ghost, who appears to Bo.One Life to Live recap (8/19/08) - ABC.com Brian Victor Johnson took over the role of the young Asa from August 22, 2008 to August 25, 2008One Life to Live recap (8/25/08) - ABC.com after Bo is transported back to 2008. Carey appeared yet again on December 29, 2008, in a videotaped message recorded by Asa before his death. Storylines The patriarch of the Buchanan family, Asa is a self-made billionaire (having purchased his first oil well at age 22In the August 16, 2007 episode, Blair Cramer notes this fact, presumably drawn from the obituary she is reading.) and Chief Executive Officer of Buchanan Enterprises (casually called \\"B.E.\\" by the family). Born on October 31, 1924,Asa's tombstone was shown August 23, 2011, which reads \\"Asa Buchanan ‚Äî October 31, 1924‚ÄîAugust 23, 2007 (date obscured, happened on-screen August 16]\\". and raised in Texas, Buchanan moves the headquarters of his company to Llanview, Pennsylvania, in 1980 to stay close to his sons. Thought dead by her sons, Asa's first wife Olympia had actually been banished to Europe by Asa after having an affair with Yancy Ralston. Living in Paris as her twin sister Nicole Bonard, Olympia (Taina Elg) surreptitiously arrives in Llanview and attempts to shoot Asa as he marries Samantha Vernon (Julia Montgomery) but is snatched by Asa's nephew Rafe Garretson (Ken Meekler) before she can reveal herself. An escaped Olympia dons a costume and mask identical to Samantha's and reveals herself at the Buchanan Ball. Olympia later falls over a balcony at a lavish costume party, and, on her deathbed, she tells Bo that Asa was not his father. Desperate to know his real family, Bo visits his aunt Euphemia Ralston, who had a vendetta against Asa for helping to bankrupt her family after Olympia's affair with Yancy. Euphemia sends her nephew Drew to Llanview to help try to figure out a way to ruin Asa and get back some of the family money, but that is thwarted when Euphemia's daughter, Delila, shows up in Llanview and marries Asa while in love with Bo. Yancy's widow, Blanche, shows up and reveals that Yancy is sterile. Bo and Delilah order Euphemia, who knew all along about this, to leave town. Delilah divorces Asa and marries Bo, but that marriage ends quickly because of her lies. Drew Ralston marries Becky Lee Abbott after she becomes pregnant with Bo's baby, but after Drew is killed, Asa marries Becky so he can raise his grandson. That marriage ends after Becky Lee is believed to be dead. In 1986, Tina Lord (Andrea Evans) discovers that Asa has been leading a double life for years; on the tropical island of Malakeva, he is known as Jeb Stuart and has been \\"married\\" to a woman named Pamela (Christine Jones) for a decade. Tina tells Pamela that her \\"husband\\" is not a sea captain, as she believes, but actually a millionaire with a family in Llanview. Noting that Asa and Pamela's marriage is not legal, Tina convinces Pamela to pretend she is dying to manipulate Asa into marrying her for real. He does on January 20, 1986, and Pamela springs from her \\"deathbed\\" and confronts her husband. Arriving in Llanview to live as \\"Mrs. Asa Buchanan\\", Pamela is at first a thorn in his side. As Asa realizes he wants her to be his wife in every sense of the word, she demands a divorce -- and half of his fortune. Their marriage ends in 1987. In 1999, it is revealed that Asa's on- again off-again wife Ren√©e Divine (Patricia Elliott) had conceived a son by Asa when they had been involved in their youth and had put the boy up for adoption. Max Holden (James DePaiva) poses as the missing heir, but Asa and Renee's real son turns out to be Ben Davidson (Mark Derwin), adopted brother of Sam Rappaport and love interest of Asa's former daughter-in-law Viki Lord Carpenter. In October 2006, David Vickers (Tuc Watkins) finds out that Asa once had an affair with David's mother, Emma Bradley, but Asa denies it. Later, David's brother Dr. Spencer Truman (Paul Satterfield) claims to be Asa's son, but a DNA test proves otherwise. A conversation between Asa and his longtime butler Nigel Bartholomew-Smythe (Peter Bartlett) hints that there is more to the story. On August 16, 2007, Asa dies in his sleep and is found by Nigel. Grandsons Cord Roberts (John Loprieno), Kevin Buchanan (Dan Gauthier), and Joey Buchanan (Nathan Fillion), and ex-wife Alex Olanov (Tonja Walker), return for his funeral.In the August 16, 2007 episode, Rex Balsom (John-Paul Lavoisier) is seen reading a front page article in The Banner titled \\"Billionaire tycoon Asa Buchanan dead at 82.\\" On August 17, 2007, Nigel tells a returned Max Holden that Asa does indeed have another son: David Vickers. Max advises Nigel to wait to tell the rest of the family, and an eavesdropping Alex overhears. She begins a search for David herself. Asa's will is executed in November 2007 as a video is played featuring the Buchanan patriarch. He bequeaths his mansion to former daughter-in-law Nora Hanen (Hillary B. Smith), who has been living there with her and Bo's son Matthew (Eddie Alderson) since her house burned down; he also leaves his yacht, the Jeb Stuart, and his tropical island, St. Blaize's, to loyal servant Nigel. Asa also notes the existence of his other son, though not his identity, and finally states that he will not be splitting Buchanan Enterprises among his heirs and taking the chance that the company will be split up or partially sold. He instead challenges the family to run it as a cohesive team and, if the company's stock rises, be rewarded handsomely in a year. Alex appears, married to an in-the- dark David, and blackmails Nigel with the facts of David's parentage. Not wanting the Buchanans to discover that con man David is one of them, Nigel gives his inheritance to Alex in exchange for her silence. Meanwhile, Buchanan Enterprises up-and-comer Jared Banks (John Brotherton)-- an admirer of Asa's who is already a favorite of widow Renee and circling Natalie Buchanan (Melissa Archer) romantically -- overhears Alex's news and pressures Nigel to pass him off as Asa's heir instead. Nigel does, and Jared feigns disinterest, armed with a lock of David's hair to prove his claim. The many wives of Asa Buchanan Asa is one of the most married male characters in daytime television, having been married 14 times to 10 different women (although three marriages were technically invalid).Because Asa had faked Olympia Buchanan's death, his marriage to Samantha Vernon is proven invalid when Olympia reveals herself as alive in 1981 at their reception. In a struggle, she falls over the upper railing and is killed; Samantha then makes the decision not to stay with Asa. Similarly, Asa's previous \\"marriage\\" to Pamela Oliver is invalid because he had wed her as \\"Jeb Stuart\\" and had been still legally married to Olympia. # Olympia Buchanan (pre-1968‚Äì82, dissolved by her death) # Pamela Oliver Stuart (1976, invalid) # Samantha Vernon (June 24, 1981, invalid) # Delilah Ralston (February 7, 1983 ‚Äì June 1983, divorced) # Becky Lee Hunt (July 11, 1983‚Äì June 1985, divorced) # Pamela Oliver Stuart (January 20, 1986‚Äì March 1987, divorced) # Ren√©e Divine (November 30, 1988‚Äì92, divorced) # Blair Cramer (June 16, 1992‚ÄìJanuary 1993, divorced) https://news.google.com/newspapers?id=XVhOAAAAIBAJ&sjid;=wBQEAAAAIBAJ&pg;=3948%2C5753098 # Alex Olanov (November 1994, invalid) # Alex Olanov (March 29, 1996‚Äì96, divorced) # Ren√©e Divine (May 18, 1999 ‚Äì May 2001, divorced) # Gabrielle Medina (May 2001‚ÄìFebruary 2002, divorced) # Gretel Rae Cummings (August 2002‚ÄìFebruary 2003, divorced) # Ren√©e Divine (February 14, 2004 ‚Äì August 16, 2007, dissolved by his death) Notes and references External links *Asa Buchanan profile ‚Äì ABC.com *Asa Buchanan profile ‚Äì SoapCentral.com * Category:One Life to Live characters Category:Television characters introduced in 1979 Category:Fictional characters from Texas Category:Fictional businesspeople Category:Male characters in television ","title":"Asa Buchanan"},{"id":"3885013","text":"\\"Silly People\\" is the 37th episode of the ABC television series, Desperate Housewives. The episode was the 14th episode of the show's second season. It was written by Tom Spezialy and was directed by Robert Duncan McNeill. It originally aired on Sunday, February 12, 2006. Plot Bree attends an elegant luncheon at fellow Fairview socialite Maxine Bennet's home. As Maxine serves the dishes, Bree cannot help but know that Maxine is getting help with the cooking since a recipe Bree used took 6 hours to cook. Bree tries to bring up during the meal that Maxine must have very good help, but her hostess denies it. Minutes later, the FBI arrives looking for Maxine and possess a warrant to search her house. The FBI look around and find a locked room which they break down. In the room they find a Chinese slave, Xiao-Mei, who is busy cooking. As Maxine is escorted out of the house in handcuffs they both scream at each other. The other women look on in shock but Bree knew \\"the proof was in the pudding\\". Later, Susan and Edie question Bree on her sudden friendship with Betty Applewhite since everyone knows that Bree was the one pointing the most fingers. Bree defends herself, and Edie asks if it is because Danielle and Matthew are dating. Bree says it is her own business how she handles Betty. As Bree talks to her daughter in the dining room, Danielle wonders why Bree is even talking to her after she betrayed her confidence. Bree tries to ask what Caleb did that made Betty hide him. Danielle does not exactly know, but suggests that she find out herself. Bree gives Danielle the advice \\"to take care of her looks\\" because she lacks everything else. Remembering that she possessed a spare key from when the Mullins lived in Betty's home, Bree sneaks over shortly after Betty and Matthew leave. She finds Caleb upstairs and introduces herself and states her business. She warms up to Caleb by bringing him some cobbler and manages to get some answers out of him. When he takes her down to his former room, Bree looks in horror on the harsh treatment Caleb had to endure. Caleb tells her that the reason he was locked down in the basement was because he hurt a girl, Melanie Foster, who then died. Caleb says Melanie was \\"pretty just like [Bree]\\". Bree gives a nervous look as she moves away from Caleb. Tom is finding a difficult time adjusting to his new job at Parcher & Murphy as Ed continues to kill all of his pitches. When Tom brings up the fact that he was in a fraternity, Ed really likes the idea but starts a series of contests for Tom to try. The first of many is to catch candies in his mouth from a distance as Ed throws them. Tom successfully catches two but the third lands on his nose. Ed gets a large laugh out of Tom's failure and agrees to give him $200 anyway. The next dare is for Tom to eat a donut dipped in toilet water. Lynette feels that they had enough and that they should quit playing games. Ed sees this as a cry from Tom. This causes Lynette to ask Ed to give her a dare since it is new company policy. Ed dares Lynette to eat a pound of raw bacon and if she succeeds without vomiting the dares will stop. Lynette manages to eat the bacon and Ed stops the dares, saying that Lynette \\"sucked the fun out of it\\". Gabrielle arrives home to find Father Crowley talking to Carlos. Father Crowley asks them if they will house Xiao-Mei, Maxine's slave who is currently awaiting plans to return to China. Gabrielle at first objects seeing as they are letting a total stranger into their home. Her mood changes when Xiao-Mei fixes a torn dress and cooks Gabrielle a lavish meal. Gabrielle asks Carlos if they could hire Xiao-Mei full-time and help her apply for citizenship. Carlos does not really agree which causes Gabrielle to leave. The following day, Gabrielle tries to convince Xiao-Mei to stay by telling her about all the good things America has to offer. Xiao-Mei sees a beautiful piece of jewelry that Gabrielle claims is worthless. Gabrielle places it on her wrist and tells her she can keep it. Xiao-Mei sees this as an act of kindness and hugs Gabrielle. When Xiao-Mei is about to leave, she refuses to get in the car and says that Gabrielle treated her with so much kindness that she considers the couple as her new family. Gabrielle hugs her and welcomes her into their home permanently‚Äîas their new maid. Susan goes to Karl for help when she is in need of a health insurance plan seeing as she no longer has one. Edie tells her that the only way to get a health plan is to marry someone quickly. Karl does not like where the conversation is going but Susan likes the idea. The following day at a coffee shop, Edie introduces Susan to Gary, a gay, upperclass businessman who is also in need of a wife because he would like to make his aging mother happy‚Äîand to collect his inheritance faster. The two plan to marry on Wednesday since Gary will be out of town two days later. At the wedding chapel, Susan meets Gary's life partner Steven (Michael McDonald) who totally objects to the idea seeing as he has proposed 6 times with no response but that Gary is willing to go to great lengths to marry a woman. This leads to an argument and Gary ends up leaving Susan at the altar. Karl finds Susan on her porch eating her would-be wedding cake. Susan tells Karl that the wedding never happened and that she is still without health benefits. Karl asks Susan if she would like to marry him and she says yes. They plan not to tell Edie about this. As Noah Taylor opens his mail that Felicia has brought him he notices a suspicious looking note which he opens. In the note he finds the phrase \\"YOU HAVE A GRANDCHILD\\" inscribed. Noah calls Detective Sullivan and asks him to visit Mike Delfino since there is apparently more information. Mike is persuaded by Sullivan to meet with Noah. Noah demands to Mike that he brings Zach to see him in 2 days or Sullivan will do it for him. Betty visits Bree shortly after hearing from Caleb that \\"a red haired woman\\" came to see him. Bree advises Betty to take a drink since they are both going to have a long, revealing chat about Caleb and Melanie Foster. Betty tells Bree the story over wine in Bree's dining room. Melanie Foster was Matthew's on-and-off girlfriend in Chicago. After one of their feuds, Caleb called Melanie and asked to meet her at the lumber yard. Melanie saw this as harmless and agreed to meet him. Caleb told Melanie that if he was her boyfriend he would never break up with her or fight. Melanie laughed in his face. Caleb tried to kiss her, but this made Melanie uncomfortable and she slapped him. This angered Caleb who picked up an axe and killed her. This, Betty believes, is the reason why she felt it was her fault and not his for not protecting him \\"from himself\\" since she is his mother and could not see him going through imprisonment or even death. Bree puts her hand out to Betty as a sign of truce.

Overview  In 1972, Donald M. Murray published a brief manifesto titled \\"Teach Writing as a Process Not Product,\\" in which he argued that English teachers' conventional training in literary criticism caused them to hold students' work to unhelpful standards of highly polished \\"finished writing.\\"Donald M. Murray, \\"Teach Writing as a Process Not Product\\" The Leaflet (November 1972), rpt. in Cross- Talk in Comp Theory, 2nd ed., ed. Victor Villanueva, Urbana: NCTE, 2003. Teachers, he explained, ought to focus less on correcting students' written products and focus more on involving students in \\"discovery through language\\", which Murray believed for \\"most writers most of the time\\" involved a process: i.e., stages of \\"prewriting, writing, and rewriting\\". Though Murray was not alone in advocating process-based instruction, this manifesto is regardedAnson, Chris. \\"Process Pedagogy and Its Legacy\\" (2014). Tate, Gary; Hessler, Brooke; Rupiper-Taggart, Amy; Schick, Kurt (eds.). A Guide to Composition Pedagogies (2nd ed.). Oxford UP. pp. 212‚Äì230 [216]. . as a landmark articulation of the differences between process and product orientations in the teaching of writing. Within a decade, Maxine Hairston was to observe that the teaching of writing had undergone a \\"paradigm shift\\" in moving from a focus on written products to writing processes.Maxine Hairston, \\"The Winds of Change: Thomas Kuhn and the Revolution in the Teaching of Writing\\" CCC 33 (1982), pp. 76‚Äì88, rpt. in The Norton Book of Composition Studies, ed. Susan Miller, New York: Norton, 2009 The writing process has typically been divided into phases of prewriting, writing, and revising.Donahue, Christiane and Theresa Lillis. (2014). \\"Models of Writing and Text Production.\\" In Handbook of Writing and Text Production, Eva-Marie Jakobs & Daniel Perrin, Eds. De Gruyter. Mouton: 55‚Äì78 [60]. Some link this three-stage writing process to the five canons of rhetoric, tying prewriting to invention and arrangement, writing to style, and revising to delivery and sometimes memory. Prewriting was defined by Project English experimental researcher D. Gordon Rohman as the \\"sort of 'thinking' [that] precedes writing\\" and the \\"activity of mind which brings forth and develops ideas, plans, designs.\\" According to Rohman, writing begins \\"at the point where the 'writing idea' is ready for the words and the page.\\" More contemporary research on writing processes suggests it inaccurate to describe these \\"stages\\" as fixed steps in a linear process. While accepting as a given that some kind of process is necessarily involved in producing any written text, contemporary studies endorse \\"the fundamental idea that no codifiable or generalizable writing process exists or could exist.‚ÄùKent, Thomas (1999). ‚ÄúIntroduction.‚Äù Post-Process Theory: Beyond the Writing-Process Paradigm. Thomas Kent, ed. Carbondale: Southern Illinois UP, 1‚Äì6 [1]. In this view, \\"writing processes are historically dynamic ‚Äì not psychic states, cognitive routines, or neutral social relationships.\\"Faigley, Lester. (1986) ‚ÄúCompeting Theories of Process: A Critique and a Proposal.‚Äù College English 48.6 527‚Äì542 [537]. Rather, they are overlapping parts of a complex whole or parts of a recursive process that are repeated multiple times throughout the writing process. For example, writers routinely discover that editorial changes trigger brainstorming and a change of purpose; that drafting is temporarily interrupted to correct a misspelling; or that the boundary between prewriting and drafting is less than obvious.  Approaches to process  Writing process has been described by composition scholars in a variety of ways with attention to \\"developmental, expressive, and social\\" elements.Sperling, Melanie. (1998). ‚ÄúProcess Theory of Writing.‚Äù In Theorizing Composition: A Critical Sourcebook of Theory and Scholarship in Contemporary Composition Studies.Mary Lynch Kennedy, ed. Westport, Conn.: Greenwood Press: 243‚Äì249 [247]. = Cognitive process theory of writing (Flower‚ÄìHayes model) =  Overview of cognitive model  Flower and Hayes extended Bitzer's rhetorical situation and developed a set of heuristics that framed the writing process as a series of rhetorical problems to be solved. The heuristics focus on the generation and the structuring of ideas. Writers should choose goals with built-in guidelines that lead their content into certain directions. While generating ideas, four viable techniques are to write ideas without editing or filtering, to play out scenarios discussing the topic, to generate analogies, and to rest on ideas. When a writer is looking to push their ideas they should try to find cue words to tie complex ideas together, to teach the ideas to another person, to tree ideas into classifications of organization, and to read their own writing as if they'd never seen it before. The last tool is to write for a specific audience by finding common ground with them.Flower, Linda S., and John R. Hayes. ‚ÄúProblem-Solving Strategies and the Writing Process.‚Äù College English, vol. 39, no. 4, 1977, pp. 449‚Äì461. JSTOR, www.jstor.org/stable/375768. Flower and Hayes further developed the cognitive model in \\"The Cognition of Discovery\\" by observing writers in order to learn how they generate meaning. They outlined the rhetorical problem as a list of what a writer may address or consider. In doing so, they created a model for the rhetorical problem that can be split up into two main categories: The rhetorical situation and the writer's own goals. The rhetorical situation is what motivates a writer to create ideas. The writer's own goals are what guide how ideas are formed. The rhetorical situation is further split into the purpose of the writing, and who will be reading it. The writer's own goals are split into how the reader is affected, the persona the writer uses, the meaning the writer can create, and implementation of writing conventions.Flower, Linda, and John R. Hayes. ‚ÄúThe Cognition of Discovery: Defining a Rhetorical Problem.‚Äù College Composition and Communication, vol. 31, no. 1, 1980, pp. 21‚Äì32. JSTOR, www.jstor.org/stable/356630. They came to three results from their study, which suggests that good writers envelop the three following characteristics when solving their rhetorical problems: # Good writers respond to all of the rhetorical problems # Good writers build their problem representation by creating a particularly rich network of goals for affecting a reader; and # Good writers represent the problem not only in more breadth but in more depth. Flower and Hayes suggest that composition instructors need to consider showing students how \\"to explore and define their own problems, even within the constraints of an assignment\\". They believe that \\"Writers discover what they want to do by insistently, energetically exploring the entire problem before them and building for themselves a unique image of the problem they want to solve.\\"  Criticism of cognitive model  Patricia Bizzell argues that even though educators may have an understanding of \\"how\\" the writing process occurs, educators shouldn't assume that this knowledge can answer the question \\"about 'why' the writer makes certain choices in certain situations\\", since writing is always situated within a discourse community. She discusses how the Flower and Hayes model relies on what is called the process of \\"translating ideas into visible language.\\" This process occurs when students \\"treat written English as a set of containers into which we pour meaning.\\" Bizzell contends that this process \\"remains the emptiest box\\" in the cognitive process model, since it de-contextualizes the original context of the written text, negating the original. She argues, \\"Writing does not so much contribute to thinking as provide an occasion for thinking.\\" = Social model of writing process = \\"The aim of collaborative learning helps students to find more control in their learning situation. Even grammar has a social turn in writing: \\"It may be that to fully account for the contempt that some errors of usage arouse, we will have to understand better than we do the relationship between language, order, and those deep psychic forces that perceived linguistic violations seem to arouse in otherwise amiable people\\". So one can't simply say a thing is right or wrong. There is a difference of degrees attributed to social forces. = Expressivist process theory of writing = According to the expressivist theory, the process of writing is centered on the writer's transformation. This involves the writer changing in the sense that voice and identity are established and the writer has a sense of his or her self. This theory became popular in the late 1960s and early 1970s. According to Richard Fulkerson's article \\"Four Philosophies of Composition\\", the focus of expressivism is for writers to have \\"... an interesting, credible, honest, and personal voice\\". Moreover, proponents of the expressivist process view this theory as a way for students to become fulfilled and healthy both emotionally and mentally. Those who teach this process often focus on journaling and other classroom activities to focus on student self-discovery and at times, low-stakes writing. Prominent figures in the field include John Dixon, Ken Macrorie, Lou Kelly, Donald C. Stewart and Peter Elbow. = Historical approaches to composition and process = A historical response to process is concerned primarily with the manner in which writing has been shaped and governed by historical and social forces. These forces are dynamic and contextual, and therefore render any static iteration of process unlikely. Notable scholars that have conducted this type of inquiry include media theorists such as Marshall McLuhan, Walter Ong, Gregory Ulmer, and Cynthia Selfe. Much of McLuhan's work, for example, centered around the impact of written language on oral cultures, degrees to which various media are accessible and interactive, and the ways in which electronic media determine communication patterns. His evaluation of technology as a shaper of human societies and psyches indicates a strong connection between historical forces and literacy practices. = Autistic autobiographies = As appealing as document sharing may be for students with autism in particular,Rose, Irene. \\"Autistic Autobiography or Autistic Life Journal.\\" Journal of Literary Disability 2.1 (2008): 44‚Äì54 being able to contextualize one's life story in the context of their disability may prove the most powerful expression of the writing process overall. Rose illustrates that creating narrative identity in a conventional sense is quite difficult for autistic students because of their challenges with interpersonal communication. The narratives of autistic students can sometimes be troubling to neurotypical peers with whom they share their work, as Rose notes in quoting autistic autobiographer Dawn Price-Hughes, \\"Sometimes reaching out and communicating isn‚Äôt easy‚Äìit can bring sadness and regret. Some of my family and friends, after reading the manuscript for this book, were deeply saddened to learn how I experienced my world.\\" Rose points to the well-known work of Temple Grandin and Donna Williams as examples of autistic autobiographies and analogizes toward the usefulness of women's autobiographies championed by Susan Stanford Friedman to show women's inter-connectivity, suggesting the same can be learned through autistic autobiographies. She writes that such works can minimize the \\"pathologisation of difference\\" which can easily occur between autistic students and neurotypical peers can be broken down by such autobiographies. As Rose directly says, \\"I argue here that awareness of the relationality of autistic life writing, and the recognition of its corollary status as testimonio and attention to the material relations of the production of these texts is particularly useful in assessing their social significance.\\" From a rhetorical perspective the use for students with disabilities (not just autistic students) seems to be promising. It would appear to foster a sense of a community among students with disabilities and helping these voices be brought in from the margins similarly to the way Mike Rose refers to students from disadvantaged backgrounds and their needs in Lives on the Boundary.  Editing  Editing operates on several levels. The lowest level, often called line editing, is the stage in the writing process where the writer makes changes in the text to correct errors‚Äîsuch as spelling, subject/verb agreement, verb tense consistency, point of view consistency, mechanical errors, word choice, and word usage (there, their or they're)‚Äîand fine-tune his or her style. Having revised the draft for content, the writer's task is now to make changes that will improve the communication with the reader. Depending on the genre, the writer may choose to adhere to the conventions of Standard English. These conventions are still being developed and the rulings on controversial issues may vary depending on the source. For example, Strunk and White's Elements of Style, first published in 1918, is considered by some to be an authority on stylistic conventions, but has been derided by linguist Geoffrey K. Pullum as \\"stupid\\". A more recent handbook for students is Diana Hacker's A Writer's Reference.Hacker, Diana. (2009). A Writer's Reference (6th ed.). Bedford/St. Martin's. .

The town administers one village, NƒÉdab (Nadab). Demographics In 1910, the town had 2821 inhabitants: 1376 (48.8%) spoke Hungarian, 1355 (48%) spoke Romanian, 49 (1.7%) spoke German. In 2011, 73.5% of inhabitants were Romanians, 19.3% Hungarians and 6.3% Roma. Economy Although the town economy is predominant agricultural, during the last decade the second and third economic sectors had a growing evolution. For most of the tourists Chi»ôineu-Cri»ô is a transit town towards central and Western Europe.

History CJFX began broadcasting on March 25, 1943, and continued on-air at 580 on the AM dial for sixty years. CJFX was a pioneer in broadcasting educational programming and live music in its early years, while boasting strong community support for its radio content, including pop, rock, country, Celtic and traditional music. While on 580, it was a variety station (country, pop, rock, Celtic etc.). The 98.9 FM signal first went on the air in 1998 in order to correct coverage issues with the AM signal Decision CRTC 98-40 and rebroadcast the AM programming. In 2003, CJFX was authorized to make 98.9 FM the main signal, increase its power and simulcast its programming on 580 AM for ninety days.Broadcasting Decision CRTC 2003-7 At this time, CJFX changed its on-air branding to \\"98.9 X-FM\\" with an adult contemporary music format. The more powerful FM signal was implemented in early 2003 and the AM 580 signal was shut down for good in June of that year. Over the next few years, the station's music format had become more of a hybrid mainstream adult contemporary/hot adult contemporary sound. In recent years, the station began to add classic hits.

Smiley is a member of Omega Psi Phi, having been initiated into its Psi Rho graduate chapter.http://www.omegapsiphims.com/chapters Career Smiley appeared as the host of the 2000 season of BET's \\"ComicView\\" program. He has also appeared on \\"Showtime at the Apollo\\", HBO's \\"Def Comedy Jam\\", HBO's \\"Snaps\\", \\"The Nashville Network\\", \\"Uptown Comedy Club\\", and \\"Comic Escape\\". His original comedy routines often feature the role-play of fictional characters such as \\"Bernice Jenkins\\" (AKA Granny Swims, Ms. Johnson or Mrs. Francis), \\"Lil' Daryl\\", \\"Rusty Dale\\" and \\"Beauford\\". Bernice Jenkins has a grandson named Rufus, who's a stereotype of the modern day \\"Gangsta\\". He is referenced in \\"Two Of My Toes Fell Off\\" and another prank phone call where Smiley calls a pharmacy. Smiley became the morning show personality for radio station KBFB in Dallas, Texas in April 2004. The show features the trademark prank calls, as well as news, information and the latest hip hop music. In 2008, Smiley signed a deal with Syndication One (a syndicated radio division of Radio One) to take the show nationwide, and The Rickey Smiley Morning Show is now heard on a number of mainstream urban radio stations. Syndication One merged into Reach Media in 2013. He has also released several humorous songs based on his bits, such as \\"Roll Tide\\" featuring his redneck character Buford, and \\"We Miss Robert\\", based on a routine of his in which a friend of a deceased drug dealer performs a rap song called \\"We Miss Robert\\" at the funeral, which is actually a song about a woman, performed in hopes of landing a record deal. Smiley had a starring role in Ice Cube's Friday After Next. He also appeared in All About the Benjamins as an informant of Ice Cube's character, Snitch Mitch. His appearance can be viewed in a deleted scene in the special features of the DVD. =Prank calls= Some of Smiley's most notable calls include: *\\"Buried Alive\\" - Smiley plays a narcoleptic who works at a funeral home and \\"fell asleep in one of these caskets\\" who calls a cemetery claiming that \\"they done buried me alive\\" and insists he is calling from inside a casket on his cell phone. He then requests that someone come and \\"dig all these graves open\\". *\\"Come Over\\" - in a bit of a reverse prank (similar to the ones the Jerky Boys innovated), a hapless caller known as \\"K.D.\\" calls a Smiley character named \\"Gina\\", a woman who initially entices him with statements like \\"I'm just 'bout to go crazy over here\\" and \\"I want you to come over and hurt me\\" before revealing she is a hermaphrodite (\\"that means I got both genitals\\"). K.D. assures Gina he is \\"still comin'\\", which prompts her to up the stakes by announcing that \\"my grandmama over here too...she a real freak.\\" K.D. then speaks to the grandmother who demands \\"I want you to scrub my head to the white meat\\" and wants to know \\"what kind of draws you got on.\\" *\\"Uncle Melvin\\" - Smiley prank calls his uncle, as a man who believes his girlfriend has left him, and who punctuates every remark with the word \\"dawg\\" (\\"Is my girl over there dawg...tell her I love her, dawg\\"). *\\"Churches\\" - Smiley plays two characters in this call, both of whom call Church's Chicken. One is an elderly lady who mistakes Church's for a \\"church\\" (e.g. wants to know \\"what time do y'all start service\\" and asks \\"who is y'all's pastor\\", and \\"well when d y'all have Sunday school?\\"); when informed that she has called a restaurant, asks \\"Don't the chicken belong to the church?\\" The other caller is \\"Willie\\", who claims to be a heavyset man with a thyroid problem (\\"I can't get out the house no more\\"), and who asks for a rundown of the menu (\\"Is y'all okra fried, or is it all slimy in the pot, like grandmama used to make\\") and who constantly requests delivery of food to his house. *\\"Pray For Me\\" - Using his \\"Granny\\" voice again, Smiley calls \\"Miss Ola Mae Benton Carter Jackson Glenn\\", and asks her to pray for a member of her church, who had been: **stabbed **involved in an ambulance crash **hit by a train **had a leg cut off by the Jaws of Life **shot \\"in the right eye\\" :Smiley then gets the woman to lead her in several verses of \\"Walk With Me, Lord\\", each verse increasing in silliness. *\\"She P-E-E-D\\" - Smiley prank calls an elderly woman using his \\"Granny\\" voice; the aftermath of the call causes the woman to laugh so hard that she ends up urinating on herself. *\\"Is My Daddy Over There\\" - Smiley plays Lil' Daryl and his brother Brandon as they call a lady claiming their father was supposed to return home with milk for their cereal. The brothers ask the lady what she has cooked for dinner over there as she ultimately hangs up on them in frustration. *\\"Whose Funeral is Today?\\" - Smiley uses his \\"Granny\\" voice and calls a funeral home, asking for her deceased neighbor named Wilbert Smith. She learns that he was cremated and she was oblivious to his death, screaming out in agony when the funeral director repeats that he was cremated. The lady then asks who they are burying this week and offers to go to that funeral to make up for missing Wilbert's. The man tells her that the person they are burying is Hattie Mae Barkley, as she screams out again in agony as it is another person she knows. Personal life On July 6, 2020, Smiley announced that his daughter, Aaryn, was shot during a road rage incident the previous weekend.

It is typically used to simplify the calculation of \\\\overline{\\\\ln Z}, reducing the problem to calculating the disorder average \\\\overline{Z^n} where n is assumed to be an integer. This is physically equivalent to averaging over n copies or replicas of the system, hence the name. The crux of the replica trick is that while the disorder averaging is done assuming n to be an integer, to recover the disorder-averaged logarithm one must send n continuously to zero. This apparent contradiction at the heart of the replica trick has never been formally resolved, however in all cases where the replica method can be compared with other exact solutions, the methods lead to the same results. (To prove that the replica trick works, one would have to prove that Carlson's theorem holds, that is, that the ratio (Z^n-1)/n is of exponential type less than pi.) It is occasionally necessary to require the additional property of replica symmetry breaking (RSB) in order to obtain physical results, which is associated with the breakdown of ergodicity.  General formulation  It is generally used for computations involving analytic functions (can be expanded in power series). Expand f(z) using its power series: into powers of z or in other words replicas of z, and perform the same computation which is to be done on f(z), using the powers of z. A particular case which is of great use in physics is in averaging the thermodynamic free energy F = -k_{\\\\rm B} T \\\\ln Z[J_{ij}], over values of J_{ij} with a certain probability distribution, typically Gaussian. See page 13, Chapter 2. The partition function is then given by Z[J_{ij}] \\\\sim e^{-\\\\beta J_{ij}}. Notice that if we were calculating just Z[J_{ij}] (or more generally, any power of J_{ij}) and not its logarithm which we wanted to average, the resulting integral (assuming a Gaussian distribution) is just \\\\int dJ_{ij} e^{-\\\\beta J - \\\\alpha J^{2}}, a standard Gaussian integral which can be easily computed (e.g. completing the square). To calculate the free energy, we use the replica trick:\\\\ln Z = \\\\lim_{n\\\\to 0}\\\\dfrac{Z^{n}-1}{n}which reduces the complicated task of averaging the logarithm to solving a relatively simple Gaussian integral, provided n is an integer. The replica trick postulates that if Z^n can be calculated for all positive integers n then this may be sufficient to allow the limiting behavior as n\\\\to0 to be calculated. Clearly, such an argument poses many mathematical questions, and the resulting formalism for performing the limit n\\\\to0 typically introduces many subtleties. When using mean field theory to perform one's calculations, taking this limit often requires introducing extra order parameters, a property known as 'replica symmetry breaking' which is closely related to ergodicity breaking and slow dynamics within disorder systems.  Physical applications  The replica trick is used in determining ground states of statistical mechanical systems, in the mean field approximation. Typically, for systems in which the determination of ground state is easy, one can analyze fluctuations near the ground state. Otherwise one uses the replica method. An example is the case of a quenched disorder in a system like a spin glass with different types of magnetic links between spins, leading to many different configurations of spins having the same energy. In the statistical physics of systems with quenched disorder, any two states with the same realization of the disorder (or in case of spin glasses, with the same distribution of ferromagnetic and antiferromagnetic bonds) are called replicas of each other. For systems with quenched disorder, one typically expects that macroscopic quantities will be self-averaging, whereby any macroscopic quantity for a specific realization of the disorder will be indistinguishable from the same quantity calculated by averaging over all possible realizations of the disorder. Introducing replicas allows one to perform this average over different disorder realizations. In the case of a spin glass, we expect the free energy per spin (or any self averaging quantity) in the thermodynamic limit to be independent of the particular values of ferromagnetic and antiferromagnetic couplings between individual sites, across the lattice. So, we explicitly find the free energy as a function of the disorder parameter (in this case, parameters of the distribution of ferromagnetic and antiferromagnetic bonds) and average the free energy over all realizations of the disorder (all values of the coupling between sites, each with its corresponding probability, given by the distribution function). As free energy takes the form: F = \\\\overline{F[J_{ij}]} = -k_{B}T\\\\overline{\\\\ln Z[J]} where J_{ij} describes the disorder (for spin glasses, it describes the nature of magnetic interaction between each of the individual sites i and j) and we are taking the average over all values of the couplings described in J, weighted with a given distribution. To perform the averaging over the logarithm function, the replica trick comes in handy, in replacing the logarithm with its limit form mentioned above. In this case, the quantity Z^n represents the joint partition function of n identical systems. REM: the easiest replica problem The random energy model (REM) is one of the simplest models of statistical mechanics of disordered systems, and probably the simplest model to show the meaning and power of the replica trick to the level 1 of replica symmetry breaking. The model is especially suitable for this introduction because an exact result by a different procedure is known, and the replica trick can be proved to work by crosschecking of results. See also The cavity method is an alternative method, often of simpler use than the replica method, for studying disordered mean field problems. It has been devised to deal with models on locally tree-like graphs. Another alternative method is the supersymmetric method. The use of the supersymmetry method provides a mathematical rigorous alternative to the replica trick, but only in non- interacting systems.

It was founded on February 9, 1904, the first high school on Staten Island. History Curtis High School is named after nationally prominent Republican writer and orator George W. Curtis, who lived nearby. The school was the first public building built following the consolidation of Greater New York. It was part of a plan to erect a major high school in each of the outlying boroughs, with Erasmus Hall High School in Brooklyn, Morris High School in the Bronx, and Flushing High School in Queens being the other three. It was designed by the architect C. B. J. Snyder. The cornerstone was laid in 1902, it was completed and opened 1904. The original building of brick and limestone is dominated by a large square turreted tower inspired by English medieval models. The first principal was Columbia graduate Oliver Durfee Clark, who served 1904 to 1906. The second principal (1906‚Äì1912) was Harry Freeman Towle, a graduate of Dartmouth College. Additions were made to the building in 1922, 1925 and 1937. John M Avent (Columbia Graduate, author) was principal from 1924 to the late 1940s. Curtis was designated a New York City Landmark on October 12, 1982. The gym and cafeteria wings were added at a later date as additions to the original building's neo-Gothic architecture. Academics Curtis offers an International Baccalaureate Scholarship Honors program with accelerated curriculum and Advanced Placement courses, and courses include nursing, NJROTC, performing arts, visual arts, business/computer institute, CoOp, human and legal studies, journalism institute and school for international services. Extracurricular activities Curtis offers a robotics team, National Honor Society, chess club, Key Club, black and Hispanic awareness clubs, film club, Moot Court, the Curtis Players, jazz band, orchestra, dance, symphonic band, the Curtis Log (newspaper), Crosswinds (yearbook), math team, criminal law and justice mentoring program, peer mediation and conflict resolution programs. = Sports = Curtis fields over thirty varsity teams, including a swimming team, as well as golf, bowling, volleyball, soccer, basketball, wrestling baseball/softball, tennis, track/cross country, gymnastics, lacrosse and football teams. In addition, Curtis club teams include boys' varsity and junior varsity, and girls' varsity Ultimate teams. The Curtis High School Track was named after Abel Kiviat and the Baseball Field was renamed Bobby Thomson Field in 2007 =Enrollment= Curtis has a total enrollment of about 2,830 and is open to residents of New York City entering either ninth or tenth grade. Enrollment requirements vary depending on which of the ten \\"houses\\" the student is going to be enrolled. There are zoned programs where enrollment is based mostly on geography, with Staten Island residents having priority over all other boroughs. Within Staten Island, geographical areas closer to the school have priority over all other areas of Staten Island. Most other programs rely either on the prospective student's grades and city standardized tests or specialized enrollment tests. The school's population is 38% African American, 31% Hispanic, 22.9% White and 7.5% Asian. =Feeder patterns and admissions= All New York City students entering high school must apply to schools, as there are no zoning boundaries for high schools in New York City. Only special zoned programs have geographical restrictions whereby certain areas of Staten Island have priority over all of the rest of New York City.

The name Zlatna (derived from the Slavic term for gold) was first recorded in a 1347 document. In 1387, it was awarded town status. During 1619-1620 Gabriel Bethlen, brought to Zlatna a few hundred German and Slovak settlers for mining work.

At work on The New Plumage, Black Swan mural, Sir Charles Gairdner Hospital, Nedlands, Perth, 1956 Art Her work was notable for the way it combined and reflected both western and aboriginal perceptions of the world. Based for much of her life in remote parts of north and central Western Australia, far from the metropolitan centres of mainstream artistic activity, Durack received stimulus and inspiration from sources quite different from those of her contemporaries, e.g. William Dobell, Arthur Boyd, Albert Tucker, et al. Separated by both geography and gender, her talent emerged \\"... original, versatile and persistent, a xerophytic adaptation, almost, to a particularly harsh environment\\".Hutchings, Patrick: \\"The Art of Elizabeth Durack\\", The Western Mail, Perth, 1981, page 9 From August 1946 when she held her first exhibition in Perth, to July 2000 when an exhibition planned by the artist was held posthumously in London, Elizabeth Durack held 65 solo exhibitions and participated in many group shows.

Eddie Burrup controversy In the 1990s, artworks by indigenous artist \\"Eddie Burrup\\" began to appear on the Aboriginal art scene. Paintings by 'Eddie Burrup' were first displayed in January 1995 in a mixed exhibition at Kimberley Fine Art‚ÄîDurack Gallery, Broome, Western Australia. The gallery was run by Elizabeth's daughter, Perpetua Durack Clancy.Brenda Niall, True North: The Story of Mary and Elizabeth Durack, Text Publishing, Melbourne, Australia, 2012. p. 237. In January 1996 Eddie Burrup was invited to participate in Native Titled Now, a 1996 Adelaide Festival of Arts Event presented by the Tandanya National Aboriginal Cultural Institute, March‚ÄìApril 1996. Later in the year works by Eddie Burrup were selected for the Telstra 13th National Aboriginal & Torres Strait Islander Art Award at the Museum and Art Gallery of the Northern Territory, Darwin, 17 August‚Äì19 October 1996. In 1997 Elizabeth Durack disclosed that Burrup was her pseudonym, an identity she considered her \\"alter ego\\". Controversy ensued, in part because her works had been included in Indigenous Australian art exhibitions.Alan McCulloch, Susan McCulloch, Emily McCulloch Childs, The New McCulloch's Encyclopedia of Australian Art, Aus Art Editions in association with The Miegunyah Press, Melbourne, 2006, p.49. Durack freely assumed the right to make Aboriginal art as Burrup.Video interview This was not appreciated by other Aboriginal artists nor the gallery owner who represented \\"Burrup\\". Durack continued to make art as Eddie Burrup until her death on 25 May 2000, aged 84. Responses from the art world and the public ranged widely. Some censured Elizabeth Durack and dismissed Burrup paintings that previously had been acclaimed. Three works by Eddie Burrup from Native Titled Now were removed from the walls of the Gippsland Art Gallery in Sale, Victoria.Australian Broadcasting Corporation TV News archives, 8 March 1997. Members of the Aboriginal art community claimed that Durack had stolen indigenous culture and John Mundine, an Aboriginal art curator, remarked that \\"it's the last thing left that you could possibly take away other than our lives or shoot us all.\\" Doreen Mellor, who had curated the Native Titled Now exhibition, stated that \\"as an Aboriginal person I feel really offended.\\" Durack was bemused by the controversy, remarking \\"I'm just using a nom de plume.

It is hosted by Joshua \\"Redbeard\\" Merriel and features punk, hardcore, emo and similar music. The name for the show was taken from the Kid Dynamite album: Shorter, Faster, Louder (Jade Tree, 2000). The show runs on a Wednesday night from 10pm to 1am and originally started broadcast in January 2004 as a 2-hour format by the show's original host, Stu Harvey, but was extended to a 3-hour version in 2006. Stu Harvey stepped aside as host of short.fast.loud at the end of 2014 to focus on other life projects and Josh Merriel has hosted the show since 2015. Major features of the show are interviews with bands both in the studio and via phonelink, scene reports from listeners around Australia as well as a segment called \\"Old School Pride\\" (Named after the H.F.L. song of the same title), where four 'old school' songs are played that are requested by a listener. Touring bands also occasionally play live acoustic sets in the studio. In the middle of every year listeners are invited to submit their top releases of the year so far for a mid-year countdown special. At the end of each year listeners are invited to submit a ranked list of their ten favourite releases of the year for an end-of-year countdown special. The show makes a point of supporting local and emerging artists. A large proportion of the music played is Australian and there are some all-Australian music nights. Tracks from demos sent to the show are also often played.

It is situated at a distance of 57 km from the county capital Arad, it occupies a 116,6 square km surface at the contact point of Cri»ôul Alb Basin and Cri»ôurilor Plateau. Ineu is the main entrance gate into the ZƒÉrand Land (»öara Zarandului). The town administers one village, Mocrea (Apatelek). Ineu was first attested in documents in the year 1214 under the name \\"Villa Ieneu\\". It was a sanjak centre in the Teme≈üvar and Varad eyalets and it was known as \\"Yanova\\" during the Ottoman rule between 1564 and 1595 and again between 1658 and 1693. Population According to the census of 2011 the population of the town counts 9078 inhabitants. From an ethnical point of view it has the following structure: 86.49% are Romanians, 6.57% Hungarians, 5.98% Roma, 0.34% Germans, 0.08% Slovaks and 0.1% are of other or undeclared nationalities. Tourist attractions The traces of habitation of this area are lost in the darkness of time. Archaeologists excavated artifacts belonging to the Neolithic civilization (axes with hole, flint tools, ceramics), to the Dacian civilization, to the Roman occupation (fortress lines, ornaments, weapons, millstones) and sources that attest the continuous inhabitance of these areas. Ineu was the residence of a Romanian administrative unit called cnezat and was a strongly reinforced keep. Ineu's castle was mentioned as a fortress in 1295. Having a strategic position in the defense of Transylvania, the castle had a life full of vicissitudes. It belonged to the fortresses of J√°nos Hunyadi, then it was occupied by the Turks for several times, being the residence of an Osmanli territorial unit until it was transferred in the possession of Michael the Brave. After it had been conquered by the Habsburgs, it became the headquarters of the frontier guard regiment. These periods and events left their marks upon the town's development. After the year 1870 it was rebuilt from its ruins in a Neoclassic style with late Renaissance and Baroque elements. It is a significant economic centre with a harmonious development of the three economic sectors. Besides, it is the main market town in the area (»öara Zarandului). The touristic potential of the town is high: Ineu's castle, the architectural complex of the town's historic centre, as well as the natural reservations are the main attractions worth visiting by the tourists coming to this region of the country.

The purpose of the Federation is to facilitate collaboration in projects related to ministry and other areas of common concern. The federation of Sisters of Charity includes: * Daughters of Charity of Saint Vincent de Paul (France; two provinces in U.S.: the Province of St. Louise, headquartered in St. Louis, Missouri, and the Province of the West, headquartered in Los Altos, California.) * Sisters of Charity of New York (New York City) * Sisters of Charity of St. Elizabeth (Convent Station, New Jersey) * Sisters of Charity of the Immaculate Conception (Saint John, New Brunswick, Canada) * Les Religieuses de Notre-Dame-du-Sacr√©-C≈ìur, (Dieppe, New Brunswick) * Sisters of Charity of Saint Vincent de Paul - Halifax (Halifax, Nova Scotia, Canada), also known as the Sisters of Charity of Halifax * Sisters of Saint Martha (Antigonish, Nova Scotia, Canada) * Sisters of Charity of Cincinnati * Sisters of Charity of Seton Hill (Pennsylvania) * Sisters of Charity of Nazareth (Kentucky) * Vincentian Sisters of Charity(VSC), (Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania) One of the original Federation members, in November 2008, the congregation merged with the Sisters of Charity of Nazareth (SCN). * Sisters of Charity of Leavenworth (Kansas) * Sisters of Charity of Our Lady of Mercy (South Carolina) *Sisters of Saint Martha of Prince Edward Island Federation The Federation developed from the \\"Conference of Mother Seton's Daughters\\" was founded in 1947 in part to advocate Seton's canonization, but has since expanded its role. The Conference remained loosely organized until 1965. The Decree on the Adaptation and Renewal of Religious Life, Perfectae Caritatis, proclaimed on October 25, 1965, by Pope Paul VI stated that: \\"Independent institutes and monasteries should, when opportune and the Holy See permits, form federations if they can be considered as belonging to the same religious family.\\" In 1997 the Federation gained recognition as a Non-Governmental Organization (NGO) at the United Nations, where it serves as an advocate for the sisters' concern for the poor at the Economic and Social Council of the United Nations. At the 2004 annual meeting in New York, the Federation voted to continue to make water a focus for advocacy, while integrating it into their efforts to address structures that keep people poor around the world. Access to water, particularly in developing countries, was seen as an important key to reducing poverty. Origins The Company of the Daughters of Charity, founded in France on November 29, 1633, developed from the parish- based Confraternities of Charity, and became the first successful institute of non-cloistered religious women to serve in the active apostolate in France. =Foundress= Saint Elizabeth Ann Seton (1774 - 1821) was the foundress of the Sisters of Charity. The foundress of the American branch of the Sisters of Charity was born Elizabeth Ann Bayley, the daughter of Dr. Richard and Catherine Charlton Bayley, members of a prominent family of New York City. Elizabeth was raised in the Episcopal faith. After the death of her mother in 1777, her father married Charlotte Amelia Barclay. Their son, Guy Charleton Bayley, was the father of James Roosevelt Bayley, who converted to Roman Catholicism and later became Archbishop of Baltimore. On January 25, 1794, Elizabeth Ann Bayley married William Magee Seton in St. Paul's Church, New York. They had five children. Seton was in the import-export business. In 1803 Mr. Seton's health deteriorated and, anticipating a better climate, he, Elizabeth, and their oldest daughter Anna Maria sailed for Leghorn, Italy, leaving the other children in care of Seton's sister, Rebecca. William Seton succumbed to tuberculosis on December 27, 1803. Elizabeth and Anna Maria were accommodated by the families of her late husband's Italian business partners, the Filicchis. While staying with them, she was introduced to Roman Catholicism. Some months later she sailed for home, arriving on June 3, 1804. In March 1805, Elizabeth Bayley Seton was received into the Catholic Church by Father Matthew O'Brien in St. Peter's Church, Barclay Street, New York. For a time she attempted to support herself by opening a school for boys, but the widely circulated report that this was a proselytizing scheme forced the school to close. Her sons had been sent by the Filicchis to Georgetown College. She hoped to find a refuge in some convent in Canada, where her teaching would support her three daughters. Reverend Louis William Dubourg, S.S., met Elizabeth Bayley Seton about 1806 in New York and invited her to Baltimore to establish a small boarding school for girls near the Sulpician institution, Saint Mary‚Äôs College & Seminary. After a long delay, she and her daughters reached Baltimore in 1808, and she opened a school next to the chapel of St. Mary's Seminary. A school for poor children was subsequently opened in nearby Emmitsburg. Elizabeth's sisters-in-law Cecilia and Harriet Seton joined her. As a preliminary to the formation of a new community, Mrs. Seton took vows privately before Archbishop Carroll and her daughter Anna. In 1810 Bishop Flaget was commissioned by the community to obtain from France the rules of the Sisters of Charity of St. Vincent de Paul. The rule, with some modifications, was approved by Archbishop Carroll in January 1812, and adopted. Mrs. Seton was elected superior. Others joined the community and on July 19, 1813, Mother Seton and eighteen sisters made their vows. Mother Seton died at Emmitsburg, Maryland, on January 4, 1821. =Expansion= In 1814 the sisters were given charge of an orphan asylum in Philadelphia; in 1817 they were sent to New York. In the 1840s the Emmitsburg motherhouse made plans to become affiliated with the French community. Archbishop Hughes of New York suggested that the New York community separate from Emmitsburg and become a diocesan community, which it did in 1846. Communities in Newark and Halifax (1856) grew out of New York. In 1850 the original Emmitsburg adopted the rule and habit with cornette of the Paris house. The winged appearance of the cornette would bring the sisters the affectionate nickname \\"God's geese\\" as they flew around a hospital in their prominent wimples. The sisters in Cincinnati separated to form a diocesan community (1852). The Sisters of Charity continued to develop into independent new congregations in Convent Station (1859) and Greensburg (1870).

This may be indicative of a business that has a unique legal or competitive advantage or of anti-competitive behavior that has driven competition from the market. An example of a unique legal advantage would be a drug company that is the first to discover and successfully manufacture a medication to treat a certain disease. Initially, as the only market player, the drug company may be able to charge supra competitive prices until other companies catch up. In this case, the regulatory hurdle for drug approval may prove a substantial barrier to new competition. However, other companies may not be able to enter the market due to another barrier to entry, intellectual property (IP) rights. The drug company may have a patent on the new formulation, barring competitors until the patent expires unless they can license rights from the IP owner. An example of a competitive advantage may be a large company with a trusted brand name and a substantial marketing budget that simply overwhelms a local competitor by driving demand for its product over the competitor's product, at least in the short term. Supracompetitive pricing may also result following a period of predatory pricing, which has potential antitrust implications for the predator. In marketing multiple competitive strategies, including price manipulation, can be used in order to gain competitive advantage. Successful marketing and business strategies are not only concentrated on creating the value for the customer, but also on the competition. Considering that, companies can decide between two main approaches, i.e. competitive strategies : ‚Ä¢ First approach is directed towards development and implementation of competition oriented strategies whose main goal is to create ‚Äúbetter state of peace‚Äù between the market competitors. ‚Ä¢ Second approach is directed towards development of strategies whose main goal is to weaken, eliminate or destroy the competitor company. Those strategies are not focused on consumer welfare, but are oriented towards maximization of profits. This type of strategy is known as predatory strategy or predatory pricing.  Concept  The concept of supracompetitive pricing is connected to the concept of predatory pricing. Predatory pricing can be defined as a dynamic market strategy that is characteristic in a single market where a company decides to develop a business strategy that includes the sacrifice in a short run in order to eliminate existing competition and acquisition of a dominant market position where the losses can be recovered by setting supracompetitive prices . Predatory pricing refers to the process of elimination of competition by setting predatory prices, prices that are so low that they drive the competition out of the market thus enabling the establishment of monopoly where a company can recoup their loss and generate more profit by setting supracompetitive prices.William J. Baumol, (2003) : Economics: Principles and Policy, vol.6  Characteristics  There are two main stages that are present in the strategy of predatory, i.e. supracompetitive pricing that include predation stage and post-predation stage (Weismann, 2006). Predation phase is focused on lowering of the prices, usually below some measure of economic cost. This is known as an incremental cost and the main purpose is to make the competitor companies to leave the market. The second phase is post-predation phase where the company raises the prices of their products and services to supracompetitive level . Taking that into account, it is possible to derive two main characteristics of supracompetitive prices (Baumol, 2003): ‚Ä¢ Supracompetitive prices are used to gain monopolistic market position and regain losses that occurred in the predatory phase, ‚Ä¢ Supracompetitive prices have no legitimate business justification besides regaining losses realized during the predatory phase.  Consequences  It is considered that traditional predatory strategy that includes setting supracompetitive prices in a regular market can‚Äôt be sustained and it is considered to be irrational . There is an ongoing debate regarding supracompetitive pricing, i.e. if there is the necessity for state authorities to pursue companies that are setting supracompetitive prices. There is an ongoing debate, as well as growing number of articles that are well informed about the issues of excessive pricing and its impact on the economy and many of those have proposed that different countries need to establish a set of measures that are most appropriate in their country regarding supracompetitive pricing (Nair, Mondliwa, 2015). This type of intervention should especially be considered in small economies where self- correction ability of the market is limited. In big markets there some arguments against intervention regarding supracompetitive prices. Those include the following : ‚Ä¢ Supracompetitive prices are self-regulating. The first argument against state intervention and regulation of supracompetitive pricing is that supracompetitive prices are self-correcting. That statement is based on two main arguments. Firstly, supracompetitive prices attract new entrants to the market that can easily gain market share by offering products and services at a lower price compared to the competitor that has set supracompetitive price. Secondly, with the possibility of new entrants, dominant companies are forced to lower the prices of their products and services in order to keep their dominant market position. In cases where there are no significant barriers to enter the market present, dominant companies will refrain from setting supracompetitive prices, at least in the long run. ‚Ä¢ Price control lessens incentives for investment. Temporary high prices are present and important in the dynamic markets. Firms invest and gain profits for risky investments when supracompetitive prices are present. Price regulation and state intervention can thus discourage potential investments since the rewards are lower in less risky environment. ‚Ä¢ Supracompetitive prices are difficult to assess. Dominant companies charge for their products and services the prices that are higher than the marginal cost. The question that it is necessary to answer is when the price is too high. There are two main criteria that need to be taken into consideration while deciding if the prices are supracompetitive. First is determining if the price poses a threat to survival of an efficient competitor. Second is determining is the price has a legitimate business justification (Baumol, 2003). ‚Ä¢ There is no appropriate regulation to remedy supracompetitive prices. Authorities can find that some companies set supracompetitive prices that undermine the customer welfare and present a threat of survival to competing companies. In those cases authorities can fine the company setting supracompetitive prices in order to stop excessive charging. But these types of activities can be implemented periodically and in the end don‚Äôt represent the long-term solution for the problem of supracompetitive pricing.  Reactions  Even though there are multiple reasons against regulation of supracompetitive prices and the traditional predation model is considered to be irrational and inefficient, there are a few conditions that need to be satisfied for this marketing strategy to be considered rational and acceptable. Those primarily include the presence of predatory company in multiple markets with multiple products and services, information distribution where possible new entrants and existing competition don‚Äôt recognize the signs of predatory strategy and presence of market conditions and entry barriers that enable supracompetitive pricing . Claims of predation and supracompetitive pricing are not uncommon in dynamic market, but in many cases those are just attempts of the competitors to raise their rivals‚Äô cost . The antitrust laws are concerned with the task of distinguishing competitive strategies that contribute to welfare enhancement of consumers from ones that reduce the welfare of consumers. That task is becoming more complex and difficult with the possible presence of predatory marketing strategy, i.e. supracompetitive pricing (Gundlach, 1995). Price predation represents only one possible strategy of companies that seek to strengthen their market position, but it is not necessarily the only marketing strategy the company applies in order to gain market power. The predatory strategy can be used in combination with other strategies such as non- predatory strategy that is focused on raising the costs of rivals‚Äô products and services. References *Phillip E.

It was developed specifically for Aeroflot local service routes using short, grass airstrips. It was also designed to be used in the light transport, aerial survey and air ambulance roles. It competed against the Antonov An-28 and the Czechoslovakian LET-410. Design and development Be-32 cabin The original design featured interconnected engines, so that in case of one engine failing, the remaining engine could drive both propellers. This feature was not implemented in the production version. The first prototype flew on 3 March 1967, fitted with Shvetsov ASh-21 piston engines, while the first production prototype flew on 18 July 1968, using more powerful Glushenkov TVD-10 turboprop engines. The first deliveries to Aeroflot were in mid-1969.Green, William, The Observers Book of Aircraft, Frederick Warne & Co. Ltd, 1970. The Be-30 was designed for a flight crew of two with passenger arrangements for 14 (in the Be-30) to a maximum of 17 (in the Be-32) seated two abreast. Corporate shuttle configuration seated seven. The air ambulance configuration could accommodate nine stretcher patients, six seated patients and one medical attendant. Three Be-30s and five Be-32s were built in the late 1960s before the program was terminated. In the early 1990s one of the original Be-32s was converted to a Be-32K demonstrator and presented at the 1993 Paris and Dubai air shows. It was painted in the colors of the now defunct Moscow Airways which had ordered 50 aircraft but ceased operations before any could be built or delivered.

At the time of writing in the early 1820s, Cobbett was a radical anti-Corn Law campaigner, newly returned to England from a spell of self-imposed political exile in the United States. Cobbett disapproved of proposals for remedies for agricultural distress suggested in Parliament in 1821. He made up his mind to see rural conditions for himself, and to \\"enforce by actual observation of rural conditions\\" the statements he had made in answer to the arguments of the landlords before the Parliamentary Agricultural Committee. He embarked on a series of journeys by horseback through the countryside of Southeast England and the English Midlands. He wrote down what he saw from the points of view both of a farmer and a social reformer. The result documents the early 19th- century countryside and its people as well as giving free vent to Cobbett's opinions. He first published his observations in serial form in the Political Register, running from 1822 to 1826. They were first published in book form in two volumes in 1830.

The village includes Yapton C of E Primary School. Other settlements in the parish include Bilsham and Flansham. Bilsham Chapel is a deconsecrated former chapel of ease to St Mary the Virgin Church; it dates from the 13th‚Äì14th century but fell out of use in the mid-16th century. The building is now a house. History The disused Portsmouth and Arundel Canal which linked nearby the River Arun to Chichester Harbour, runs through the village. This was built primarily on the financial case it would be a safe inland shipping route between London and Portsmouth avoiding the then risk of attack in the English Channel by the French. Throughout its lifetime, 1823-1855 - a time when the Wey and Arun Canal was open (having opened 7 years earlier and having closed in 1871) - the route was used for transporting agricultural goods and munitions, for instance, from Chilworth and Hanworth gunpowder works and to/from the military docks on the lower Thames in the Royal Borough of Greenwich.

Emanating from the heart of Brahmagiri forest flowing through roots, leaves and flowers of ancient trees and medicinal herbs, Papanasini is a holy mountain stream accessible around 1 km northwest of the temple premises. Pilgrims bathe here as they consider its waters to be sacred with powers to absolve one's sins. Further, the temple offers services to immerse cremation ashes in the sacred mountain stream to be thus carried to Kaveri River and from there to the ocean. This is a part of the last rites. Rajiv Gandhi 's ashes are immersed here. According to Thirunelli temple officials, if the ashes of the dead are immersed in Papanasini, it is equivalent to doing the rituals in Gaya.

They are highly reactive yet have been reported in a few natural products such as Dysidazirine. There are two isomers of azirine: 1H-azirine with a carbon-carbon double bond are not stable and rearrange to the tautomeric 2H-azirine, a compound with a carbon-nitrogen double bond. 2H-Azirines can be considered strained imines and are isolable.  Preparation 2H-Azirine is most often obtained by the thermolysis of vinyl azides. During this reaction, a nitrene is formed as an intermediate. Alternatively, they can be obtained by oxidation of the corresponding aziridine. :Azirine synthesis  Reactions  Photolysis of azirines (under 300 nm) is a very efficient way to generate nitrile ylides. These nitrile ylides are dipolar compounds and can be trapped by a variety of dipolarophiles to yield heterocyclic compounds, e.g. pyrrolines. The strained ring system also undergoes reactions that favor ring opening and can act as a nucleophile or an electrophile. An azirine is an intermediate in the Neber rearrangement.

The Windsor is notable for being Australia's only surviving grand 19th century city hotel and only official \\"grand\\" Victorian era hotel. The Hotel Windsor has a 5-star rating. The Windsor is situated on Bourke Hill in the Parliament Precinct on Spring Street, and is a Melbourne landmark of high Victorian architecture. For much of its 20th century life the hotel, dubbed the Duchess of Spring Street, was one of the most favoured and luxurious hotels in Melbourne. It has hosted many notable national and international guests.  History  Grand Hotel, Melbourne (ca. 1879-ca. 1894) State Library Victoria H2008.59/15 The original hotel was built by shipping magnate George Nipper and designed by Charles Webb in a broadly Renaissance Revival style and was completed in 1884, and named \\"The Grand\\". However, Nipper soon sold the building, in 1886, to the a company headed by James Munro and James Balfour. Munro was a politician and the leader of the temperance movement in Victoria, who famously burnt the hotel's liquor licence in public and operated the hotel as a coffee palace, now renamed the \\"Grand Coffee Palace\\". The building was soon more than doubled in size in 1888, by adding the central section and the north wing, matching the original building, the now internal north wing, and extending the rear wing, all designed again by Charles Webb. Notable features of the expanded hotel included the ballroom, the impressive main staircase, the distinctive twin mansard roofed towers in the Second Empire style, and the stone sculpture, attributed to John Simpson Mackennal, over the main entrance with male female figures known as 'Peace and Plenty' reclining over the English and Australian Coat of Arms. Grand Hotel and Spring Street in 1906 Munro was declared bankrupt in February 1893, and a new owner of the hotel took over in 1897. The hotel was amalgamated with the neighbouring Old White Hart Hotel, re-licensed, and its name was changed back to the Grand Hotel. In January 1898, the Federal Council held its third session in Parliament House across the street; the Council was finalising the Constitution of Australia that would federate the states into one country, and many representatives stayed at the hotel, holding many informal meetings there. In 1920, the hotel changed hands again, was refurbished, and renamed \\"Windsor Hotel\\", in honour of the British Royal Family. For much of the 20th century, the hotel dubbed the Duchess of Spring Street was one of the most favoured and luxurious hotels in Melbourne, hosting many notable national and international guests.Duchess:The storey of the Windsor Hotel, Chrystopher J Spycer, Loch Haven Books, 1993 = Decline and demolition proposal= With the construction of modern 'international' hotels, starting with the Southern Cross in 1962, the Windsor declined in popularity. In a bid to regain market share, the Windsor expanded, purchasing the four storey White Hart Hotel on the Bourke Street corner. The White Hart was demolished and a new classically inspired extension became the Windsor's north wing designed by the office of Harry A. Norris. By the mid-1970s, the Windsor was run-down and the last of the major historic 19th century hotels in Australia still operating. The other major hotels, the Menzies (1867‚Äì1969) and the Federal (1888‚Äì1972) in Melbourne, and the Australia (1890‚Äì1971) and Metropole (1890‚Äì1969) in Sydney, had all been demolished. Several proposals were put forward which included the demolition of the Windsor. A 1974 proposal for a 38-storey tower on the corner of Spring and Bourke Street was opposed by the state government and the National Trust, a green ban being placed by the Victorian Builders Labourers Federation helped ensure the building's survival. The Rupert Hamer-led state government purchased the building in 1976 to ensure its preservation and in 1980 leased it to The Oberoi Group. = New owners and restoration = Melbourne Windsor Hotel Lobby after the restoration in 2008 Oberoi undertook a major restoration of the hotel in 1983 costing US$6.6 million, reinstating the decorative 19th century colour schemes to the lobby, stairhall, and especially the Grand Dining Room, where huge brass chandeliers were reproduced from photographs. This was one of the first major private historic restorations in Melbourne, and won a Victorian Architect's Institute award.Walking Melbourne ‚Äì A guide to the Historic and Architectural Landmarks of Melbourne, National Trust of Australia (Victoria) Its position as a leading five-star hotel and a major Melbourne landmark was then firmly re-established. The cricketer's bar, afternoon tea in the grand dining room, and the top- hatted doorman all resumed their status as Melbourne institutions. The John Cain II state government sold the hotel to the Oberoi Group giving the company freehold possession in 1990. In 2005, Oberoi sold the hotel to the Halim family based in Indonesia. = 2008-2019 redevelopment proposals = Hotel Windsor looking towards the Spring Street entrance The Halim group first proposed to redevelop the Windsor in 2008 shortly after acquiring remaining shares from the Oriental Pacific Group and rebranding as \\"Hotel Windsor\\", with a $45 million redevelopment which proposed to modernise many of the interiors although they would not disclose whether the hotel was running at a loss or making a profit. The plan was approved by Heritage Victoria and the government after significant negotiations with the owners which included reducing the heritage impacts of the proposal. However development did not commence due to the Financial crisis of 2007‚Äì2010. In July 2009, the Halim group proposed a new $260 million refurbishment project which would add 152 rooms to the hotel. This would involve demolition of the hotel's 1960s-era north wing, and replacing it with a contemporary building with facilities expected by guests staying in a five star hotel. A thin curtain wall tower designed by Denton Corker Marshall was proposed be built replacing the 1880s rear wing, on Windsor Place. The architects proposed that the fritted wavy glass of the facade was a solution to minimise the visual impact of the tower. The application submitted to Heritage Victoria included restoration of the 1880s facade facing Spring and Little Collins Streets. The National Trust of Australia (Victoria), opposed to the development, concerned that the proposed tower would dominate the front heritage wing of the hotel, and would breach established height controls for the Bourke Hill precinct initially put in place to protect vistas towards Parliament House and low-rise nature of the area. Windsor at dusk In late February 2010, a news leak occurred which erupted in a government scandal surrounding the redevelopment of the Windsor Hotel. A document prepared by a senior media advisor to Planning Minister Justin Madden was sent by email to the ABC Newsdesk. It detailed plans by the Victorian Government to run a sham community consultation process in a bid to reject the plans. On 18 March 2010, the hotel refurbishment and redevelopment plans including the tower were approved by then Planning Minister, Justin Madden. A permit from the State Government body Heritage Victoria who had listed the hotel was also issued. The National Trust appealed the planning permit to VCAT, which determined that they had no jurisdiction over a place on the Victorian Heritage Register, a decision which the Trust took to the Supreme Court of Victoria, but lost in September 2010. In response to the concerns, the Victorian Ombudsman was asked to examine the decision making process, and the report handed down in February 2011 found a number of flaws, but could only recommend better processes in the future. An Age newspaper investigation summarised what had happened. In May 2010, the Senate of Australia officially recognised the national significance of the Windsor Hotel.THE PARLIAMENT OF THE COMMONWEALTH OF AUSTRALIA. JOURNALS OF THE SENATE No. 120 TUESDAY, 11 May 2010 Further permits from the State Government body Heritage Victoria were not resolved until January 2012, and this delay meant the 2010 planning permit would lapse. The new Minister for Planning, Matthew Guy refused an extension, but an appeal to VCAT was successful in August 2012, with work to commence by 10 January 2015. In 2013 more extensive works to the interior of the building were proposed which appalled heritage groups, replacing much of the interior except the grand stair, dining room and the 'heritage suites' in the front wing, which were approved by Heritage Victoria in September 2013. After this, the owner sought another extension to the original planning permit, which the Minister refused, and upheld by VCAT in August 2014, meaning work must commence by 10 January 2015. In mid 2015, new planning controls for the area were put in place, with a mandatory 40m height limit for the rear part of the Windsor site, much lower than the planned tower. With only very preliminary works having started, the Halim group applied for another extension, this time for completion, which the Minister for Planning refused. Another appeal to VCAT was successful, and in 2016, an extension of the completion date to 31 March 2020 was granted. The VCAT decision noted that another extension was unlikely. In August 2019 with no further work occurring, another application for an extension was sought, which the Minister for Planning refused, and the Halim group announced that they would work with Heritage Victoria on an 'alternative solution'.

The station airs a Top 40/CHR radio format and is owned by Townsquare Media. Studios and offices are on Alexander Road in Princeton, New Jersey. Its broadcast tower is located west of Morrisville, Pennsylvania at (). The station's service contour covers Central Jersey, as well as an adjacent portion of the Philadelphia/Delaware Valley media market. History On August 7, 1965, 94.5 signed on as WTTM-FM. It was owned by the Scott Broadcasting Company, Inc. of New Jersey and was the adjunct to WTTM (920 AM). On February 1, 1969, WTTM-FM became WCHR, a religious station; in 1974, it was approved to increase its effective radiated power to 50,000 watts. The Scott family sold WTTM and WCHR in 1996 for $20 million to Nassau Broadcasting Partners. The sale prompted immediate speculation that a format change was in the offing for WCHR. That November, WCHR's religious programming began being simulcast on 920 AM. On February 27, 1998, the 94.5 frequency began stunting with construction sound effects. On March 2, 1998, at 5:00 p.m., 94.5 relaunched as \\"New Jersey's Oldies Station\\", with new WNJO call letters. The station's format of primary 1960s oldies was selected so as to avoid cannibalizing Nassau's other Trenton station, WPST (97.5 FM). The first request on the new WNJO was made by Governor Christine Whitman, who attended the launch. WNJO brought in morning personality Don Kellogg Who was a ratings winner, but facing competition from WKXW which was moving in a 1970s direction, and inspired by the revenue success of a similar flip at Nassau's station in Allentown, Pennsylvania, WNJO became classic hits \\"The Hawk\\" on December 1, 2001 and adopted WTHK call letters on August 1, 2002. WPST's contemporary hit radio format moved from 97.5 to 94.5 on February 14, 2005 at 5pm. at the same time, WTHK's programming moved to 97.5, which had been approved to move its community of license to Burlington, New Jersey, closer to Philadelphia. The new WPST at 94.5 cut into the audience for Philadelphia's hot adult contemporary 95.7 WMWX, which became adult hits two months later and the following year switched its call letters to WBEN-FM. The station, along with nine other Nassau stations in New Jersey and Pennsylvania, was purchased at bankruptcy auction by NB Broadcasting in May 2012. NB Broadcasting is controlled by Nassau's creditors ‚Äî Goldman Sachs, Pluss Enterprises, and P.E. Capital. In November, NB Broadcasting filed a motion to assign its rights to the stations to Connoisseur Media. The sale to Connoisseur Media, at a price of $38.7 million, was consummated on May 29, 2013. On March 22, 2018, it was announced that the station had been sold by Connoisseur Media to Townsquare Media (along with WNJE-AM and WCHR-AM) for a deal totaling $17 million.http://www.insideradio.com/townsquare-adds-chr-powerhouse-wpst-to-its- trenton-talker-wkxw/article_7597048e-2dcb-11e8-8cf6-77d81d14ac56.html The acquisition was finalized on July 2, 2018.

He presented a popular radio programme called The Ballroom of the Air. The station ruled the airwaves in South Asia and millions tuned in to hear Radio Ceylon. Owen de Abrew brought with him a flair and creativity to English radio programmes on the Station. He continued giving his input when Radio Ceylon became the Sri Lanka Broadcasting Corporation. De Abrew worked very closely with broadcasting legends Livy Wijemanne and Vernon Corea at Radio Ceylon throughout the 1950s and 1960s.  Ballroom Dance Awards  The National Association of Dancing of the UK awarded Owen de Abrew a medal for outstanding contribution to Ballroom Dancing in Sri Lanka in 1989 and Owen de Abrew received this award from John Dilroy who was the UK's Ten Dance Champion, Fellow and Examiner of the Imperial Society. Two of de Abrew's students represented Sri Lanka at the World Championships in the United States in 1988. Owen de Abrew has handed the ballroom dance mantle to his son Ravi de Abrew who is a dance champion in his own right in Sri Lanka.

He was in the service of the Democratic Republic of Georgia (1918-1921). After the Soviet forces occupied the country, he left for Poland and joined the Polish army as a colonel. During the Nazi invasion of 1939, he took part in the northern defense of Warsaw. He was later awarded with the Silver Cross of the Virtuti Militari. During the German occupation of Poland he joined the Polish Home Army. As part of the Polish underground resistance movement he used the pseudonym Tomasz. After the Red Army took control of Poland, Valerian Tevzadze joined the Polish underground against the communists until his death in 1987. He lived in Dzier≈ºoni√≥w, where he died. He was buried at the local cemetery. An inscription is carved on his grave: ‚ÄûJako Gruzin chcia≈Çbym byƒá pochowany w Gruzji, ale jestem szczƒô≈õliwy, ≈ºe bƒôdƒô pochowany w ziemi szlachetnego i dzielnego Narodu Polskiego‚Äù (As a Georgian I would like to be buried in Georgia, but I'm happy to be buried in the land of the noble and brave Polish nation.)

Tevzadze is one of the people portrayed in the documentary film W rogatywce i tygrysiej sk√≥rze, directed by Jerzy Lubach. In 2009, a monument dedicated to Tevzadze was unveiled in front of the headquarters of the Sp√≥≈Çdzielnia Mieszkaniowa (Housing Cooperative) in Dzier≈ºoni√≥w in the presence of the Georgian ambassador to Poland Konstantine Kavtaradze. In 2019, Polish Prime Minister Mateusz Morawiecki visited the tomb of Valerian Tevzadze at the Dzier≈ºoni√≥w cemetery. The annual chess tournament named Tewzadze Open is organized in Dzier≈ºoni√≥w, to commemorate Tevzadze.

Florence Martus (1868-1943), also known as \\"the Waving Girl\\", took it upon herself to be the unofficial greeter of all ships that entered and left the Port of Savannah, Georgia, between 1887 and 1931. A few years after she began waving at passing sailors, she moved in with her brother, a light keeper, at his small white cottage about five miles up the river from Fort Pulaski. From her rustic home on Elba Island, a tiny piece of land in the Savannah River near the Atlantic Ocean, Martus would wave a handkerchief by day and a lantern by night. According to legend, not a ship was missed in her forty-four years on watch. A statue of Martus by the sculptor Felix de Weldon has been erected in Morrell Park on the historic riverfront of Savannah. Personal life Martus' father was an ordnance sergeant at Fort Pulaski on Cockspur Island, where she was born.NPS National Park Service Legends Many other legends endure about this woman, notably the following: * The reason she greeted ships was because she had fallen in love as a young girl with a sailor and wanted to be sure he would find her when he returned.Legendary Lighthouses: Great Lighthouses-South Atlantic at www.pbs.org When, after 44 years, he did not, she died of a broken heart * Sailors would bring her gifts * When the captain of the ship that brought her memorial statue to Savannah arrived, he refused to accept payment because of his fond memories of MartusCharleston and Savannah at www.softadventure.net While these old tales may be accurate, there is no strong supporting evidence for any of them.

Early life and career He was born in Sta. Cruz, Manila, on February 24, 1862. Evangelista finished his Bachelor of Arts at the Colegio de San Juan de Letran in 1878. He was awarded a medal of excellence in Mathematics. Poor health made him to drop his idea of studying medicine. After this, he became a teacher, a cattle dealer, a tobacco merchant between Cebu and Manila, and later a contractor of public works. He soon went to Madrid in 1890. It was during this time that he befriended many Filipino patriots, including Jos√© Rizal, who advised him to study engineering in Belgium. He therefore enrolled at the University of Ghent, one of the world‚Äôs top engineering schools, and finished civil engineering and architecture with highest honors. He then received profitable offers of employment from several institutions in Europe but he declined because of his zeal to serve his country. Philippine Revolution He returned to the Philippines in September 1896, shortly after the start of the Philippine Revolution. He was arrested and imprisoned, since the Spanish authorities suspected many people of the revolution and he had in his possession Jose Rizal's Noli Me Tangere and El Filibusterismo, but he escaped. He joined General Emilio Aguinaldo‚Äôs command on October 22, 1896. At the Imus Assembly on December 31, 1896, Evangelista had submitted his draft of a constitution as requested by both Magdalo and Magdiwang factions of the KKK. He was elected Lieutenant General in the said meeting, now in the ranks of Artemio Ricarte. Aguinaldo later utilized General Evangelista‚Äôs engineering skills. He planned and built forts and barricades in Bacoor, Binakayan, Cavite Viejo, Munting-ilog, Silang, Dasmari√±as, Imus, Salitran, Lumang-bayan, and Noveleta, to serve as protection against Spanish forces. One Spanish general commented that the fortifications were the \\"fortifications of the future.\\" Aguinaldo himself publicly recommended Evangelista to head the revolutionary government that would be established in lieu of the Katipunan, for he was \\"the most educated\\" in the organization. Aguinaldo also said that Evangelista could \\"command the respect of the Spaniards\\". He was part of the Magdalo government, serving as assistant overall captain general to Aguinaldo. Though in the actual sense, he was neutral in the Magdalo-Magdiwang feud. Evangelista was calm but fatalistic, a characteristic misinterpreted as bravery. He was drawing trenches on the ground with a stick while the enemy fired cannons at their forces. One time, a shell dropped very near him yet he did not flinch nor run, instead he brushed the dust off his coat and continued to draw. His life soon ended, as well as hopes for him by fellowmen, when he died, along with Captain Mariano San Gabriel and Captain Mariano Ram√≠rez, on February 17, 1897 during the Battle of Zapote Bridge. His post was succeeded by his prot√©g√©, Miguel Malvar. Legacy A military camp in Cagayan de Oro was named after him, Camp Edilberto Evangelista. However, local lawmakers in the area have recently filed House Bill No. 4735, suggesting to change the name into Camp Jose Montalvan. Camp Edilberto Evangelista is the largest military camp in Mindanao with an area of 129 hectares. It houses the 4th Infantry Division of the Philippine Army. There are two major streets named after Evangelista: one in Quiapo, Manila; the other in Bangkal, Makati. The streets that bear his name are now famous for its thrift and second-hand shops. The main street in Bacoor City, was also named after him, from Zapote to Mabolo [Gen. Evangelista St.] House Bill No. 5659, passed on December 18, 2008 by seven lawmakers, sought to rename the Alabang-Zapote Road in Las Pi√±as to General Edilberto Evangelista Avenue for the latter's fearless exploits during the Philippine Revolution.

Bevel gears are most often mounted on shafts that are 90 degrees apart, but can be designed to work at other angles as well. The pitch surface of bevel gears is a cone. Bevel gear on roller shutter door. Independently from the operating angle, the gear axes must intersect (at the point O) Bevel gear lifts floodgate by means of central screw. Bevel ring gear on the rear wheel of a shaft-driven bicycle Spiral bevel gear Introduction Two important concepts in gearing are pitch surface and pitch angle. The pitch surface of a gear is the imaginary toothless surface that you would have by averaging out the peaks and valleys of the individual teeth. The pitch surface of an ordinary gear is the shape of a cylinder. The pitch angle of a gear is the angle between the face of the pitch surface and the axis. The most familiar kinds of bevel gears have pitch angles of less than 90 degrees and therefore are cone-shaped. This type of bevel gear is called external because the gear teeth point outward. The pitch surfaces of meshed external bevel gears are coaxial with the gear shafts; the apexes of the two surfaces are at the point of intersection of the shaft axes. Bevel gears that have pitch angles of greater than ninety degrees have teeth that point inward and are called internal bevel gears. Bevel gears that have pitch angles of exactly 90 degrees have teeth that point outward parallel with the axis and resemble the points on a crown. That's why this type of bevel gear is called a crown gear. Mitre gears are mating bevel gears with equal numbers of teeth and with axes at right angles. Skew bevel gears are those for which the corresponding crown gear has teeth that are straight and oblique. Types Bevel gears are classified in different types according to geometry: * Straight bevel gears have conical pitch surface and teeth are straight and tapering towards apex. * Spiral bevel gears have curved teeth at an angle allowing tooth contact to be gradual and smooth. * Zerol bevel gears are very similar to a bevel gear, but the teeth are curved: the ends of each tooth are coplanar with the axis, but the middle of each tooth is swept circumferentially around the gear. Zerol bevel gears can be thought of as spiral bevel gears, which also have curved teeth, but with a spiral angle of zero, so the ends of the teeth align with the axis. *Hypoid bevel gears are similar to spiral bevel, but the pitch surfaces are hyperbolic and not conical. The pinion can be offset above or below the gear center, thus allowing larger pinion diameter, longer life, and smoother mesh. If the beveled surface is made parallel with the axis of rotation, this configuration resembles a worm drive. Hypoid gears were widely used in automobile rear axles. Hypoid Bevel Gear  Mitre gears  Miter gears Mitre gears are a special case of bevel gears that have equal numbers of teeth. The shafts are positioned at right angles from each other, and the gears have matching pitch surfaces and angles, with a conically-shaped pitch surface. Mitre gears are useful for transmitting rotational motion at a 90-degree angle with a 1:1 ratio. Geometry of a bevel gear A double-helical bevel gear made by Citroen in 1927 for the Mi≈ôejovice water power plant The cylindrical gear tooth profile corresponds to an involute (i.e. a triangle wave projected on the circumference of a circle), whereas the bevel gear tooth profile is an octoid (i.e. a triangle wave projected on the normal path of a circle of a sphere). All traditional bevel gear generators (such as Gleason, Klingelnberg, Heidenreich & Harbeck, WMW Modul) manufacture bevel gears with an octoidal tooth profile. IMPORTANT: For 5-axis milled bevel gear sets it is important to choose the same calculation / layout like the conventional manufacturing method. Simplified calculated bevel gears on the basis of an equivalent cylindrical gear in normal section with an involute tooth form show a deviant tooth form with reduced tooth strength by 10-28% without offset and 45% with offset [Diss. H√ºnecke, TU Dresden]. Furthermore, those \\"involute bevel gear sets\\" cause more noise. =List of drawing symbols= Teeth There are two issues regarding tooth shape. One is the cross-sectional profile of the individual tooth. The other is the line or curve on which the tooth is set on the face of the gear: in other words the line or curve along which the cross- sectional profile is projected to form the actual three-dimensional shape of the tooth. The primary effect of both the cross-sectional profile and the tooth line or curve is on the smoothness of operation of the gears. Some result in a smoother gear action than others. Tooth line The teeth on bevel gears can be straight, spiral or \\"zerol\\". =Straight tooth lines= In straight bevel gears the teeth are straight and parallel to the generators of the cone. This is the simplest form of bevel gear. It resembles a spur gear, only conical rather than cylindrical. The gears in the floodgate picture are straight bevel gears. In straight bevel gear sets, when each tooth engages it impacts the corresponding tooth and simply curving the gear teeth can solve the problem. =Spiral tooth lines= Spiral bevel gears have their teeth formed along spiral lines. They are somewhat analogous to cylindrical type helical gears in that the teeth are angled; however, with spiral gears the teeth are also curved. The advantage of the spiral tooth over the straight tooth is that they engage more gradually. The contact between the teeth starts at one end of the gear and then spreads across the whole tooth. This results in a less abrupt transfer of force when a new pair of teeth come into play. With straight bevel gears, the abrupt tooth engagement causes noise, especially at high speeds, and impact stress on the teeth which makes them unable to take heavy loads at high speeds without breaking. For these reasons straight bevel gears are generally limited to use at linear speeds less than 1000 feet/min; or, for small gears, under 1000 r.p.m.Doughty and Vallance, Design of Machine Members. =Zerol tooth lines= Zerol bevel gears are an intermediate type between straight and spiral bevel gears. Their teeth are curved, but not angled. Zerol bevel gears are designed with the intent of duplicating the characteristics of a straight bevel gear but they are produced using a spiral bevel cutting process. Manufacturing bevel gears  =Materials used in gear manufacturing process= The various materials used for gears include a wide variety of cast irons, non ferrous material and non ‚Äì metallic materials. The selection of the gear material depends upon: * Type of work * Peripheral speed * Degree of accuracy required * Method of manufacture * Required dimensions and weight of the drive * Allowable stress * Shock resistance Some materials chosen include: * Cast iron, which is popular due to its good wearing properties, excellent machinability and ease of producing complicated shapes by the casting method. It is suitable where large gears of complicated shapes are needed. * Steel, which is sufficiently strong & highly resistant to wear by abrasion. * Cast steel, which is used where stress on the gear is high and it is difficult to fabricate the gears. * Plain carbon steels, which find application for industrial gears where high toughness combined with high strength. * Alloy steels, which are used where high tooth strength and low tooth wear are required. * Aluminum, which is used where low inertia of rotating mass is desired. * Gears made of non‚Äìmetallic materials give noiseless operation at high peripheral speeds. Bevel gearing Bevel gearing Two bevel gears in mesh is known as bevel gearing. In bevel gearing, the pitch cone angles of the pinion and gear are to be determined from the shaft angle, i.e., the angle between the intersecting shafts. Figure shows views of a bevel gearing. Applications The bevel gear has many diverse applications such as locomotives, marine applications, automobiles, printing presses, cooling towers, power plants, steel plants, railway track inspection machines, etc. For examples, see the following articles on: * Bevel gears are used in differential drives, which can transmit power to two axles spinning at different speeds, such as those on a cornering automobile. * Bevel gears are used as the main mechanism for a hand drill. As the handle of the drill is turned in a vertical direction, the bevel gears change the rotation of the chuck to a horizontal rotation. The bevel gears in a hand drill have the added advantage of increasing the speed of rotation of the chuck and this makes it possible to drill a range of materials. * The gears in a bevel gear planer permit minor adjustment during assembly and allow for some displacement due to deflection under operating loads without concentrating the load on the end of the tooth. * Spiral bevel gears are important components on rotorcraft drive systems. These components are required to operate at high speeds, high loads, and for a large number of load cycles. In this application, spiral bevel gears are used to redirect the shaft from the horizontal gas turbine engine to the vertical rotor. Bevel gears are also used as speed reducers Bevel gears on grain mill at Dordrecht. Note wooden teeth inserts on one of the gears. Advantages * This gear makes it possible to change the operating angle. * Differing of the number of teeth (effectively diameter) on each wheel allows mechanical advantage to be changed. By increasing or decreasing the ratio of teeth between the drive and driven wheels one may change the ratio of rotations between the two, meaning that the rotational drive and torque of the second wheel can be changed in relation to the first, with speed increasing and torque decreasing, or speed decreasing and torque increasing. Disadvantages * One wheel of such gear is designed to work with its complementary wheel and no other. * Must be precisely mounted. * The shafts' bearings must be capable of supporting significant forces.

The bank had its headquarters in Oslo and was Norway's second largest bank at the time of the merger. Christiania Bank had branch offices in London, New York, and Singapore. History Kreditkassen's headquarters in Oslo The bank was founded in Oslo (then called Christiania) in 1848 as Christiania Kreditkasse, though changed its name to Christiania Bank og Kreditkasse in 1862. In 1858, the bank moved out of its temporary location at the home of the bank manager, Fritz Henrich Fr√∂lich, and to permanent locations. It opened branches in 1897, under the directorship of Peter Harboe Castberg The bank expanded out of Oslo in 1957 when it bought Elverum Kreditbank and Hamar Privatbank, and in 1959 with the acquisition of Agder Bank. By 1965, the bank had 18 offices outside Oslo. In 1973, the bank opened its first international office, in Luxembourg. In the 1980s, the bank further acquired Andresens Bank (in 1980), Vestfoldbanken (in 1981) and Fiskernes Bank (in 1983). In the last years of the 1980s, there was a major financial crisis in Norway and by 1991 the bank had used up all capital. To save the bank, the Government of Norway took over the bank and gave it new capital, rescuing it from bankruptcy. In the early years of the 1990s, the bank also bought Sunnm√∏rsbanken and S√∏rlandsbanken. In 1995, the government reduced its ownership to 51%, listing it on the Oslo Stock Exchange, and in 1999 to 35%. The same year, the Swedish MeritaNordbanken bid for the bank, and in 2000 the government sold its shares and the bank became part of Nordea.

It is the sequel to EA Sports' previous boxing title, Fight Night Round 2, which was released in 2005. Fight Night Round 3 was released on February 20, 2006 for the Xbox, Xbox 360, PlayStation Portable and PlayStation 2. The Mobile phone version was released on November 30, 2006, and the PlayStation 3 version was released five days later. Overview Fight Night Round 3 was developed by EA Chicago. It is the third boxing title in the Fight Night franchise. It features the usual improvements such as better graphics and gameplay. \\"Impact Punches\\" are one of the most drastic changes, along with ESPN Classic fights and a new career mode, in which the player fights to gain popularity in order to reach sponsored fights, or to be featured on ESPN. Unlike in older versions, Round 3 defaults without a heads-up display (HUD), allowing a player to judge the status of their stamina and energy based on their stance, movements, and facial features, instead of the usual stamina meter. The roster consist of 27 licensed fighters, Fight Night Round 3 allows open weight bouts. This means everyone on the roster can fight one another in exhibitions. The official roster allows recreations of such fights as James Toney vs. Roy Jones Jr. Versions The game has been released for several video game consoles and some differences exist between the versions. The cover art features Arturo Gatti and Micky Ward on the PS2 and Xbox versions. The PS3, Xbox 360, and the PSP versions have Oscar De La Hoya on the cover. Only the PS3 version can be played in a first-person view. The PS3 version omitted Evander Holyfield from the roster. Theme song The theme song for this game is \\"Never Gonna Get It\\" by Sean Biggs, featuring Akon and Topic. Venues The game features recreations of real-life venues such as the Staples Center and Madison Square Garden. Critical reception and awards The game received \\"favorable\\" reviews on all platforms except the PSP version, which received \\"average\\" reviews, according to video game review aggregator Metacritic. G4's Reviews on the Run's Victor Lucas stated that Round 3 had the best graphics he had ever seen on a video game.Reviews on the Run, 11 March 2006 IGN gave the Mobile version a score of eight out of ten, saying, \\"What this all adds up is a serious package for fight fans. You have a complex control scheme that gives you access to some devastating small-screen fight action. I think this emphasis on hardcore mechanics reduces Fight Night's reach to a mere sliver of the mobile gaming audience, though. I respect and understand the point of the Fight Night franchise, but I hoped EA Mobile would include some sort of option for the casual-minded. I guess that's what Super KO Boxing is for.\\" Maxim gave the PS3 version a perfect ten, saying, \\"What you get here is the same game on the PS3‚Äîcomplete with the boring mini-games, the long load times, and the unbelievably addictive boxing action‚Äîwith one all-important twist: the PS3 version includes a first-person mode. \\"Get in the Ring\\" mode puts you into the jockstrap and bads tats of your self-created boxer. Everything you could do in the game's third-person mode you can now do in first-person.\\" The A.V. Club also gave said version an A and said that, \\"The only real problem with Round 3 is that any improvements in Round 4 are likely to be strictly cosmetic.\\" The Sydney Morning Herald gave said version a score of four stars out of five and said, \\"Victories are initially too simple and training dull but professional bouts hugely engaging. Patient defence, careful countering, well-timed combinations and conserving stamina are crucial.\\" Detroit Free Press gave the same console version a score of three stars out of four and said, \\"Like a fierce haymaker to the jaw, the visuals of Fight Night Round 3 will knock you on your rear end.\\" In Japan, Famitsu gave the same console version a score of two eights and two sevens for a total of 30 out of 40. The game was criticized for its highly intrusive product placement. While brands for athletic apparel, such as Everlast and Under Armour are expected in a sports game, sponsorship by Dodge and Burger King is regarded as excessive (The Burger King can even be used as a trainer). It won GameSpot's award as the game with \\"The Most Despicable Product Placement\\". The game received the IGN award for Best Offline Multiplayer on PlayStation 3 in 2006. It also received the first ever BAFTA (British Academy of Film & Television Arts) for a sports video game in 2006. It is the only game in the series to be listed in the book 1001 Video Games You Must Play Before You Die.

The estuary‚Äôs tidal action extends a inland and has characteristic widths of between and . Besides the tidal channel there are interfaces to the upland dunes including mudflats, sand beaches and shingle flats. Reaches of salt marsh occur, but they are primarily near the Waterside Bridge (crossing of the A975 road) and the mouth of the Tarty Burn, a small tributary river. Based upon the habitat of the moorland bordering the east of the Ythan River near the mouth, this estuary is Mike Madders and Julia Welstead, Where to Watch Birds: Scotland, A and C Black Publishers Ltd, London (2002) the most significant coastal moorland in the northern United Kingdom. The Ythan Estuary is a designated Site of Special Scientific Interest (SSSI) and appears as site no. 939 on the Ramsar list of wetlands of international importanceRamsar List of SSSI in the United Kingdom (2006) with Meikle Loch. There are 50 breeding pairs of common shelducksIngold, P (1991) Competition for feeding areas and dominance relationships among shelducks Tadorna tadorna with broods, (1991) Ornis Scand 22 (1): 27-32 in the estuary, and there is a mixed tern breeding colony on the east shore from the mouth comprising Arctic, Sandwich, little and common terns. Leisure activities including birdwatching, fishing, canoeing and wildfowling are permitted. There are hides to watch waders (best at low tide), and a wildfowling code of conduct with a voluntary refuge area south of the main bridge over the estuary (A975). Visitors can fish for estuarine species such as flounder for free but are advised not to disturb birds during the breeding season. Game fisher's catching salmon and sea trout is by permit only. Topography and geometry Ythan Estuary with tern colonies and dunes in background. North of the estuary mouth extend the Sands of Forvie, the most extensive sand dune formation in Europe, which has been shown to have been a Stone Age settlement. Some of the dunes north of the estuary rise to a height of about and the lower ones to the south of the estuary rise to about in height. Proceeding from the mouth the estuary inland, there are initially beach sands at the margin, thence shingle beach and mudflats. Quickly, by the time of reaching the first roadway bridge crossing about up the estuary, there are mussel beds and marshy areas. At its widest point the Ythan Estuary is approximately wide. The verges of the upper reaches range from extensive mudflats to marsh and fen. Further upstream is a small island known as Geck Island () inaccessible to waders even at low tide, and which is a haven for cormorants. The broader landscape drained by the Ythan near the coast is a generally mild sloping farmland known as the Buchan plain, which is virtually devoid of trees. In the glacial era, the Ythan River at this point would have been a torrent of melt waters streaming down from the Scottish Highlands. Archaeology Prehistoric man had settlements in coastal estuaries along the northeast Scottish coast including the nearby River Don Estuary and the Ythan Estuary. Studies date the lithics recovered at least as early as 7000 BC, with most of the artefacts from the Ythan mouth area deriving from the Sands of Forvie.Graeme Warren, Sands of Forvie, UCD (Dublin) School of Archaeology, prepared for Historic Scotland and the Aberdeenshire Council (2005) Most of the large collection of lithics was retrieved in the period 1994-2001 from a deflation surface within this active dune system. The excavations revealed the survival of superimposed land surfaces, whose layers revealed hearth structures and other characteristic mesolithic artefacts. Although no Viking artefacts have been recovered here, a few kilometres north along the coast is the only place name associated with Viking landings, Saint Olaf at Cruden Bay. Ecology Dunes on south bank of Ythan Estuary There are several distinct habitats within the Ythan Estuary complex including marsh, littoral, estuarine, lacustrine and dunes. Thus there is an unusual diversity of flora and fauna present in this nature reserve. The estuary itself is tidal, located seven kilometres from the North Sea. In the estuary and its verges, the presence of tern colonies is notable, since there are several distinct species that utilize the north banks of the Ythan Estuary, and comprise a percentage of the breeding pairs of terns in the United Kingdom. In the summer terns can be observed feeding in their characteristic diving patterns approximately 600 to 900 metres inland from the estuary.Ythan Estuary, Aberdeenshire, Lumina Technologies, Aberdeen Library archives, June, 2004 At the river mouth species of birds include scaup, long-tailed duck, red-breasted merganser and velvet scoter. In lesser numbers guillemot and razorbills are occasionally seen at this outlet to the North Sea. Extensive mussel beds are found about three kilometres from the estuary mouth, and these provide food for common eider (with the occasional king eider, oystercatchers and turnstonesSandy Anderson, Birdwatching around the Ythan Estuary, Scottish Bird News No. 24 (December, 1991)). On the Forvie Moor element of the Ythan Estuary complex, both mute and whooper swans occur. Meikle Loch is an element of the Ythan Estuary complex and sustains some aquatic vegetation, and from November to March is home to many wading birds, ducks and geese. Conservation status Based upon Articles 4.1 and 4.2 of the European Union Directive 79/409/EEC this site qualifies as a Special Protection Area (SPA) by supporting biota populations of European importance. The component landforms which are considered elements of the SPA or SSSI are the estuary itself, the dunes to the east known as the Sands of Forvie, Meikle Loch and the adjacent Kippet Hills. The Ythan Estuary SPA code is UK9002221, which designation was conveyed on 30 March 1998. Per Article 4.1, Annex I, the Ythan Estuary complex supports the following significant bird populations during the breeding season: * Common tern Sterna hirundo, 265 pairs representing up to 2.2% of the breeding population in Great Britain. * Little tern Sterna albifrons, 41 pairs representing up to 1.7% of the total breeding population in Great Britain * Sandwich tern Sterna sandvicensis, 600 pairs representing up to 4.3% of the breeding population in Great Britain The Ythan Estuary also is qualified per Article 4.2 of the EU Directive by sustaining the following winter migratory species population of European significance: * Pink-footed goose Anser brachyrhynchus, 7213 individuals representing up to 7.7% of the mean wintering Eastern Greenland/Iceland/United Kingdom population See also * Fowlsheugh * Wetland * Important bird area  References External links * Fisheries Research Service Ythan Estuary Description * Webcam overlooking the Ythan Category:Nature reserves in Scotland Category:Stone age sites Category:Estuaries of Scotland Category:Special Protection Areas in Scotland Category:Landforms of Aberdeenshire Category:Ramsar sites in Scotland Category:Important Bird Areas of Scotland Category:Bodies of water of the North Sea Category:Moorlands of Scotland ","title":"Ythan Estuary"},{"id":"3885594","text":"Ravina Raj Kohli, earlier President of the Channel Nine, is one of the prominent media personality of India.

History In 1943, Rabbi Yosef Yitzchok Schneersohn founded Sheloh as a part of Merkos L'Inyonei Chinuch, the educational branch of the Chabad-Lubavitch movement. The program was first directed by Rabbi Y. Feldman. In 1945, Rabbi Jacob J. Hecht was appointed director, and continued in this position until his death in 1990. Rabbi Schneersohn, and his son in-law and successor Rabbi Menachem Mendel Schneerson, were constantly involved in the program.Sichos In English, \\"A Treasury of Letters from the Lubavitcher Rebbe\\" In 1961, when the legality of the Released Time hour was challenged in Washington, D.C., Rabbi Schneerson worked hard to fight for its continuation, even sending a delegation to Washington to support it.  Description  These classes take place off public school premises, in keeping with the United States Supreme Court decision in McCollum v. Board of Education (1948). Generally they are held in a nearby synagogue, but if none is available, they may be held in a wedding hall or similar venue. Jewish released time classes, like those organized by other religious groups, take place for one hour each week (generally on Wednesdays), at the end of the school day. In these classes, children are taught to recite basic Jewish prayers, and learn about the Torah, Jewish history, Jewish law, and Jewish ethics. The teachers are Rabbinical students from the local central Lubavitcher Yeshiva Tomchei Temimim; for locations where there is no such Yeshiva, the teacher is the local Shliach or one of his assistants. Sheloh's 1946 year-end summary stated that there were 5000 children from 150 different public schools attending their classes every week, with separate classes for boys and girls. By the later 1940s, there were 10,000 children attending Released Time's weekly sessions. (Decades later the classes became generally co-educational.) Given the limited amount of time, actual reading of Hebrew was not part of the curriculum. Today Sheloh is a division of The National Committee for the Furtherance of Jewish Education, founded by Rabbi Jacob J. Hecht. The current chairman of NCFJE is Rabbi Sholem Hecht, and the director of Sheloh is Rabbi Zalman Zirkind. Sheloh's mission has broadened to include assisting children who are interested in full-time Jewish education to enroll in Yeshivos. Sheloh also hosts other programs such as Released Time Winter Camp and Shabbatons (Shabbat get-togethers). These activities, in turn, have led to many parents becoming Baalei teshuva as a result of their children's interest in Judaism. Zorach v. Clauson In 1952, the case of Zorach v. Clauson came before the Supreme Court. The case involved the education law of New York State, particularly a regulation by which a public school was permitted to release students during school hours for religious instruction or devotional exercises. In a 6 to 3 ruling, the high court upheld the New York law. In the majority opinion, Justice William O. Douglas wrote that New York's program \\"involves neither religious instruction in public schools nor the expenditure of public funds\\", unlike the earlier McCollum case that the Zorach plaintiffs had cited as precedent. Douglas wrote that a public school \\"may not coerce anyone to attend church, to observe a religious holiday, or to take religious instruction. But it can close its doors or suspend its operations as to those who want to repair to their religious sanctuary for worship or instruction. No more than that is undertaken here.\\" The Court's opinion stated that In the McCollum case the classrooms were used for religious instruction and the force of the public school was used to promote that instruction. Here, as we have said, the public schools do no more than accommodate their schedules to a program of outside religious instruction. We follow the McCollum case. But we cannot expand it to cover the present released time program unless separation of Church and State means that public institutions can make no adjustments of their schedules to accommodate the religious needs of the people. We cannot read into the Bill of Rights such a philosophy of hostility to religion. http://www.JewishNorthOrlando.com See also *Released time *Chabad-Lubavitch *Baal teshuva  References  *Levin, Sholom Dovber.

Denoted by their gray habits and pointed hoods, the Recollects took vows of poverty and devoted their lives to prayer, penance, and spiritual reflection. Today, they are best known for their presence as missionaries in various parts of the world, most notably in early Canada. The order had its origins in the 16th century. Officially named the \\"Order of Friars Minor Recollect\\", they used the post-nominal initials O.F.M. Rec. (Latin: )\\"Order of Friars Minor Recollect (O.F.M. Rec.) - R√©collets\\" GCatholic.org. Gabriel Chow. Retrieved February 29, 2016 or O.M.R. (). In 1897, Pope Leo XIII officially dissolved the Recollects order and integrated it as a part of the Franciscan order, officially changing their name to Friars Minor.  Etymology  In Latin , this last word is the genitive form of (: , a particple of , ‚Äòto gather‚Äô). It related to French : ‚Äúgathering one's thought in contemplation, meditation‚Äù. (‚ÄúKnown as the Recollects, , the gathered/collected, live in great contemplation.‚Äù) The origin of the name \\"Recollects\\" is still debated. Some historians attribute it to the houses (retreats). Others credit it to the orders‚Äô practice of accepting only those who possessed the ability of recollection. France Former Recollect friary in Saverne, Alsace, France The Recollect branch of the Friars Minor developed out of a reform movement of the Order which began in 16th-century Spain under figures such as Peter of Alcantara, where the followers of the reform were known as Alcantarines. It was observed by communities of friars in France in Tulle in 1585, at Nevers in 1592, at Limoges in 1596 and in Paris at Couvent des R√©collets in 1603. The distinctive character of Recollection houses was that they were friaries to which brothers desirous of devoting themselves to prayer and penance could withdraw to consecrate their lives to spiritual reflection. At the same time, they were also active in many pastoral ministries, becoming especially known as military chaplains to the French army. The French Recollects had 11 provinces, with 2,534 friaries by the late 18th century. The branch was suppressed during the French Revolution.Order of Friars Minor \\"General History of the Order Second Period (1517-1909): The Recollects\\"  In New France =Canada= The Recollects were important as early missionaries to the French colonies in Canada, although they were later displaced by the Jesuits. When Samuel de Champlain returned from his sixth voyage to Canada on the 26th of May 1613, he made plans to bring missionaries on his next voyage. Champlain had initially turned to the Recollects after receiving advice from his friend Sieur Louis Houel, Secretary to King Louis XIII and controller-general of the salt works at Hiers-Brouage. Houel was familiar with the Recollects who had been established in Brouage since 1610. Since the merchants from the Soci√©t√© des Marchands de Rouen et de Saint-Malo were paying Champlain's expensive transportation costs, they insisted he and Houel choose effective yet inexpensive missionaries to join the voyage Thus, the vows of poverty observed by friars played in their favor. Champlain was also influenced by the successful Franciscan missions in the New World and in Japan. Furthermore, the Jesuit Acadian mission had failed in 1613 following a British raid led by Captain Samuel Argall against Port Royal in present-day Nova Scotia. There had also been resentment towards Jesuits in France at the time when Champlain was planning his mission. Echoes of controversies between the Jesuits and Jean de Biencourt de Poutrincourt et de Saint-Just, the lieutenant-governor of Acadia, involving comments made about the regicide of King Henry IV on May 14, 1610, resonated in France.These events persuaded Champlain that the Recollects were the right religious order to bring to New France.The Recollects travelled to New France with Champlain in 1615, where they first arrived at Tadoussac in May 1615, and later travelled to Quebec City in June 1615. Father Denis Jamet, the commissary overseeing the establishment of the mission in New France, Fathers Joseph Le Caron, Jean Dolbeau, and Brother Pacifique Duplessis [du Plessis] were chosen as missionaries to accompany Champlain. Although the Recollects were not the first religious order in New France (the Jesuits had been in Acadia since 1611), they were the first to enter and establish themselves as an order in the province of Quebec. Upon arrival the Recollet Fathers formed a conclave to divide the territory of Quebec. Jean Dolbeau was assigned the northern shore of the Saint-Lawrence Valley, the territory of the Montagnais (Innu), as well as the post of Tadoussac. Joseph Le Caron was given the Huron Mission and other Amerindian populations in the regions of Grands Lacs. Denis Jamet receives missions between Quebec City and Trois-Rivi√®res. As part of the Anglo-French War of 1626‚Äì1629 in Europe, the British captured Quebec City on July 20, 1629. On September 9 of that same year, the Recollects were forced to return to France along with the Jesuits, who were forcibly removed on July 21. The two groups of friars were transported to Calais, France, where they arrived on October 29, 1629. The Recollects petitioned the French government several times between 1630 and 1637 to return to New France, but were blocked by Cardinal Richelieu and his agents, who were determined to keep both the Jesuits and the Recollects out of New France. Several Recollects, including veteran missionary Joseph Le Caron, appealed to the Capuchin missionaries, originally from New England, to return the Quebec mission to them. The Capuchins acquiesced, but Cardinal Richelieu ordered that the Jesuits replace the Capuchins in Quebec, additionally forbidding the Recollects from traveling on French ships to New France. Frustrated with the French bureaucracy, the Recollects petitioned the papacy in Rome to return to New France, and succeeded in gaining permission to undertake their endeavour in 1637. However, they were once again denied passage aboard French ships. This conflict continued in 1643 when Queen Anne of Austria, the regent of France, who granted their request, but once again no transport was obtained. The Recollects would not re-enter New France until 1670, nearly forty years since their expulsion After returning, they reestablished missions at Quebec, Trois- Rivi√®res, and Montreal. In 1759, British conquest once again interfered with the Franciscans. Five years later, the bishop of Quebec, Jean-Fran√ßois Hubert, annulled the vows of any friar professed after 1784. Their numbers gradually decreased until, by 1791, only five friars remained. The last Canadian Recollect, Father Louis Demers, died in Montreal in 1813.Dictionary of Canadian Biography Online =Newfoundland= In Newfoundland, Recollect friars established a friary in 1689 at the island's capital, Plaisance (now Placentia), which was staffed until 1701 by friars from Saint-Denis, near Paris. In 1701, they were replaced by friars from Brittany, an arrangement which lasted until the expulsion of the French from Newfoundland in 1714 after the Treaty of Utrecht. In English-speaking Newfoundland, Recollect priests from Ireland played a significant role in the introduction and early leadership of Roman Catholicism on the island, following the public announcement of religious liberty to Roman Catholics by Governor John Campbell in 1784. The evangelization missions taking place between 1615 and 1629 can be divided into three periods. The first, from 1615‚Äì1623, was a period of discovery: it marked their initial effort at understanding and discovering the regions of Huronia and Tadoussac. During the second phase, from 1623‚Äì1625, the Recollects concentrated their efforts of evangelization in Huronia. The third period, from 1625 until their expulsion from New France in 1629, marks a time frame in which the Recollects shared their territory with the Jesuits, as the latter only arrived in New France in 1625. =Relations with native populations in New France= Recollect and Jesuit missionaries were very much the same, in the sense that both orders sought to Christianize natives, while at the same time using similar methodologies. Within the Recollect theory of conversion, the French settlers in New France played a primordial role in the Christianization of indigenous peoples. They believed that colonization and evangelization were inseparable. This is compared to the Jesuits, who held their evangelization efforts completely separate from their involvement in the French colony. The Recollects never neglected the French settlers in favour of devoting themselves entirely to the conversion of natives. French settlers were seen by the Recollects as the key to creating their ideal society; they wished to promote French and native intermarriage, in the hopes of eventually building a larger Christian settlement. In practice, however, the native populations encountered by the Recollects had no intentions on settling permanently in the French colony. This led the missionaries to instead travel alongside indigenous communities in the hopes of teaching them about the Catholic faith, much like their Jesuit counterparts. The goal of the Recollects in New France was to undertake missionary work among the indigenous peoples who lived there. This work was not without its challenges; for example, language proved a difficult barrier to overcome. To solve this problem, the Recollects recruited (helpers), who were young and resourceful men from humble backgrounds, to interpret indigenous linguistic patterns and respond with gestures and miming. The were supported financially by the missionaries, giving some the opportunity to rise within New France's social ranks. For example, Nicolas Marsolet was granted a seigneury, while Pierre Boucher became governor of Trois-Rivi√®res, later founding the town of Boucherville. Their return to New France in 1670 was led by Father Germain Allart, accompanied by Gabriel de la Ribourde, Simple Landon, Hilarion Guenin, Anselme Bardoun, and Brother Luc. The territory of Quebec had since been carved up amongst the Jesuits, who claimed the Laurentian Valley and other western territories, and the Sulpicians who owned Montreal and its surrounding region. At this point, the conversion of Amerindians to Christianity was no longer the main priority of the Recollects, as they were more concerned with rebuilding infrastructure that had been left behind following their expulsion by the British in 1629. Nonetheless, they continued to partake in evangelization missions in Gaspesie, in Acadia, and in Louisiana. The Recollects usually had close connections to the natives. In fact, when they first arrived in New France, they openly welcomed ‚Äúunruly‚Äù native children within their walls in order to teach them the way of God. Even though they quickly realized that they did not have enough money to continue this mission, they still maintained relatively good relations with the natives, especially with the Hurons. As the Recollect Gabriel Sagard shows in his writings, their convent was very close to a few indigenous settlements, and he himself was very good friend with some Hurons. Some even addressed him with Huron kinship terms; some called him Ayein, meaning ‚Äúson‚Äù and others called him Ataquen, meaning ‚Äúbrother‚Äù. He also writes about what a typical day with them looked like: he would usually eat with them, and then he would sometimes follow them as they went about their everyday lives. They taught him about their beliefs, their customs, and they taught him their language, which would later help him in creating a useful dictionary. =Legacy= Despite their limited financial resources and small numbers, the Recollects were the first to carry out significant missionary work in New France. For example, they were the first pastors in the colony at Port Royal. Jean Dolbeau celebrated the first Mass ever said in Quebec. He became Provincial Commissary of the mission in 1618 and preached the first jubilee accorded to Canada. He built the first friary of the Recollects at Quebec in 1620. Texts written by Recollect missionaries combined aspects of natural history and ethnography, as they generally paid very close attention to the environments these men lived in. In the case of Sagard, he describes everything that he sees, from plants, to animals, to his relations with the natives he encounters. Compared to the Jesuits, Recollect presence in New France was minimal. The writings of the Recollects were less popular than those of the Jesuits, who targeted a wider audience. Consequently, their works were less influential for the Jesuit writings on New France were considered more authoritative sources on the New World. When writing about their missions, the Recollects emphasized the importance of observing, interacting with and understanding indigenous societies prior to writing about them. Their works often spoke of the difficulties encountered by missionaries when converting natives, which led to these texts being dismissed by readers as pessimistic. This explains, in part with the burning of the Recollects convent in 1796, the small quantity of texts related to the missions which have survived to this day. Recollects were important in the documentation of indigenous life in New France. Chrestien Leclercq wrote Nouvelle Relation de la Gasp√©sie, which concerns itself with the ways of life of those indigenous communities that he resided with as a result of his missions among the Mi‚Äôkmaq of Gasp√©sie. As a result of spending so much time among the Mi‚Äôkmaq people, Leclercq was able to learn their language. His fluency in their dialect allowed him to compose a dictionary of the Mi‚Äôkmaq language, meant to serve as an aid for future missionaries who would live among these First Nations people. Pacifique Duplessis was later sent to Trois- Riv√®res, where he evangelized Aboriginal communities, cared for the sick, and educated children. Because of the latter, he has been considered the first schoolmaster in New France. In 1620, the Recollects completed construction on the Notre-Dame-des-Agnes convent in Quebec, the first Canadian convent and Seminary. Father Nicolas Viel travelled to Huronia with Gabriel Sagard and other missionaries to assist Father Le Caron. As a result of this voyage, Sagard published one of his more notable works Le grand voyage du Pays des Hurons (1632) and later his Histoire du Canada (1636) in which he described the daily life, customs, and habits of the Hurons. To this day Leclercq's Nouvelle Relation de la Gasp√©sie and Sagard's Le grand voyage du Pays des Hurons is considered an important piece belonging to the large corpus of texts published on eastern Canada during its French regime.  In other countries The Recollects were also present in other parts of the world. In 1521, the Province des Anges sent a few missionaries, R.P. Martin de Valence with nine priests and two fathers in the West Indies, and there, they converted in a very short time more than one thousand and two hundred Indians. = Provinces= In the late 17th century, the order had these provinces outside of Europe: four in New Spain, four in Peru, and two elsewhere in Latin America and two in Southeast Asia. ; Four provinces in New Spain * (\\"Holy Gospel\\") * (\\"The Apostles Sts. Peter & Paul, Michoac√°n\\") * (Yucat√°n) * (\\"The Most Holy Name of Jesus, Guatemala\\") ; Four provinces in the Viceroyalty of Peru * (\\"The Twelve Apostles\\") * (\\"St. Francis\\") * (\\"The Most Holy Trinity, Chile\\") * (\\"The Holy Faith, the Kingdom of the New Granada\\") ; Four more provinces * (Nicaragua) * Philippines (\\"St. Gregory, the Philippines islands\\") * (\\"St. Anthony, Brazil\\") * (\\"St. Francis, Malacca\\") = Latin America = ; Argentina The Recollect monastery/convent in Buenos Aires is where the neighborhood of Recoleta got its name. ; Guatemala The Recollects established a friary in Antigua, Guatemala. It was destroyed by the Santa Marta earthquakes of 1773 and is preserved today as a national monument, La Recolecci√≥n Architectural Complex. =Germany and the Lowlands= Through the presence of Spanish rule in the Low Countries, the reform took hold there, and then spread to the German friars. By the end of the 17th century, all of the provinces of the German-Belgian Nation of the Order of Friars Minor were Recollect. This branch of the Recollects did not die out with the French Revolution but survived and was reinvigorated in the 19th century. By that period, it was one of the four major branches of the Order of Friars Minor, all of which lived under obedience to the Minister General of the Order, but under their own Procurators General. All of them were merged in the Great Union of 1897 mandated by Pope Leo XIII. At that time, there were seven provinces of Recollects.History of the Franciscan Movement Notable Recollect friars *Jan Boeksent - Baroque sculptor from Flanders. *Francis Davenport-An English Catholic theologian, authored the treatise on the Thirty-nine Articles. *Joseph de La Roche Daillon--A missionary, he discovered that the indigenes in what is now New York State were using petroleum. *Jean Dolbeau-One of the original four Recollects in Canada, he served successively as Master of novices, Guardian, definitor, and provincial delegate at the General Chapter of the Order held in Spain in 1633. *Louis Hennepin-Tasked by his superior to accompany La Salle on his expedition to explore Western New France, helped bring attention to Saint Anthony Falls and Niagara Falls. *Denis Jamet-Leader of the first Recollects in New France, he completed the first regular convent of the Recollects in 1621.

Colonel Martin J. \\"Matt\\" Winn (June 30, 1861 ‚Äì October 6, 1949) was a prominent personality in American thoroughbred horse racing history and president of Churchill Downs racetrack, home to the Kentucky Derby race that he made famous. In 2017, he was inducted into the National Museum of Racing and Hall of Fame as a Pillar of the Turf. A Louisville, Kentucky, businessman, Matt Winn had been a racing enthusiast since the day his father brought him to see the first running of the Kentucky Derby in 1875. In 1902, Matt Winn was operating as a merchant tailor. He was asked by one of his clients, William E. Applegate, (who, at that time, owned over eighty percent of the New Louisville Jockey Club) to become involved in the reorganization and management of Churchill Downs. Winn came on board as vice president to run the catering operation and summer entertainment and in 1914 he was listed as general manager of the new Louisville Jockey Club. A skilled marketer, in his first year running the racetrack, his promotions for the event saw the business make its first-ever annual profit. A few years later, Winn was involved in changing the wagering from bookmaker betting to a Parimutuel betting system and in 1911 increased business substantially by reducing the wager ticket from $5 to $2. Matt Winn used his understanding of marketing to weave an aura of romance around the Kentucky Derby. In 1915, he convinced the multimillionaire sportsman Harry Payne Whitney to ship his highly rated filly Regret from New Jersey to Louisville to compete in the Derby. Whitney agreed, and Winn's effort paid off with nationwide publicity surrounding the first filly to ever win the Derby. Winn called Regret's victory a turning point, and he worked to create an event of exotic grandeur that women soon flocked to, coming from both fashionable society and the ordinary working classes. Under Winn, the Kentucky Derby became the preeminent thoroughbred horse race in America and in recognition of his accomplishments, the Governor of Kentucky bestowed on him the honorary title of Kentucky Colonel. In 1937, Winn and the Derby made the cover of the May 10th issue of Time magazine. In 1944, Colonel Winn collaborated with Frank G. Menke to publish \\"Down The Stretch: The Story of Col. Matt J. Winn.\\" He died a few years later in 1949 in Louisville. The Matt Winn Stakes for three- year-olds held each May at Churchill Downs was named in his honor. He is buried in his family plot in St. Louis Cemetery, 1215 Barret Avenue, Louisville Kentucky.

Early life and career Jesus Villamor was one of six children of Associate Justice of the Supreme Court of the Philippines, Ignacio Villamor of Bangued, Abra, and Mariquita Flores. He studied commerce at De La Salle College (now DLSU-Manila) in Manila, hoping to pursue a business career. During summer, he and his family went to Baguio and stayed in one of the government houses on Hogan's Alley, which are now assigned to Justice of Court of Appeals, just below Cabinet Hill along Leonard Wood Road. One of his playmates during this time was Roberto Lim, son of Brigadier General Vicente Lim. Jess (as one of his friends would call him), at the age of 14 to 15, was already an aviation bug. He was worried that because of his short height, he wouldn't pass the physical exam. He learned how to fly in the civilian flying school in Grace Park that was located next to La Loma cemetery. Roberto Lim took his first airplane ride with Jess in a Stearman plane. He also signed Roberto Lim's first civilian license.P51, Pushing the Envelope, A Biography of Roberto H. Lim, Composed of Collected Letters, Emails and Photos He joined the Philippine Army Air Corps (PAAC) Flying School in 1936 and was sent to the United States for training, and after three years, began flying B-17's as part of the US Army Air Forces Strategic Bombing Squadron. In 1939, Villamor assisted in teaching Dwight D. Eisenhower how to fly. Military service =Philippine Army Air Corps service= Upon his return to the Philippines, Villamor was assigned to lead the 6th Pursuit Squadron (now 6th Tactical Fighter Squadron) in Nichols Airfield. On July 26, 1941, by order of President Franklin D. Roosevelt, the Philippine Army was incorporated into the United States Army Forces in the Far East. Following this, PAAC was inducted into the into the Far East Air Force on August 15, with 141 pilots, 17 ground officers, 1,200 enlisted men, and 64 aircraft, with Maj. Basilio Fernando as its Commanding Officer. No less than Gen. MacArthur himself was the inducting officer. Gen. MacArthur forecasted that Japan will commence with its attack in April 1942, and event at the earliest January 1942. Eight hours after the attack on Pearl Harbor, December 8, 1941 10:00am PST, bombers and fighters of the Imperial Japanese Army and Navy took off from Takao Airbase in Formosa and attacked sites around Baguio and Iba Airfield in Zambales, with the second wave attacking Clark Air Base and Naval Station Sangley Point. The following day, the FEAF's capabilities were crippled as it found half of its aircraft inventory destroyed, the Japanese in turn only lost 7 aircraft in the two days of raids giving them practical air superiority over Northern Luzon. With the FEAF crippled, the 6th Pursuit Squadron at Nichols Airfield was one of the remaining units available to meet the enemy. At 11:30 am on December 10, while the unit was having lunch, general quarters was sounded, and the PAAC would have its baptism of fire. Capt. Villamor, along with Lieutenants Godofredo Juliano, Geronimo Aclan, Alberto Aranzaso, and Jose Gozar met another wave of Mitsubishi G3M bombers and Mitsubishi A6M Zero fighters over the skies of Zablan Airfield and Pasig with their Boeing P-26 Peashooters. Despite the disadvantage, Villamor and his squadron was credited with four kills - one Mitsubishi G3M bomber and three Mitsubishi A6M Zeros. Two of them by Villamor himself. The following day, the 6th Pursuit Squadron moved to Batangas Airfield north of Batangas City. On December 12, a force of 27 bombers and 17 fighters targeted Batangas Airfield, and on this day in Philippine military history a Filipino military aviator died in the line of duty. Lt. Cesar Basa was on patrol has been flying for two hours and only had 15 minutes of fuel left when the Japanese were heading to Batangas. Despite being outnumbered 7‚Äì1, Lt. Basa engaged the enemy and was still able to land his damaged aircraft in Nichols Airfield. However he was fatally wounded due to ground strafing by a Mitsubishi A6M Zero. The 6th Pursuit Squadron returned to Nichols Airfield on December 13 with 4 remaining P-26s, and on the following day, Lt. Gozar in turn for the last time in the war was able scramble by himself to meet the Japanese raiders. Lt. Gozar was able to survive the encounter against three Japanese Zeros with one unconfirmed kill, and land his battered aircraft. While greatly outclassed and outnumbered, the accomplishment of the 6th Pursuit Squadron has become of a legend and a source of encouragement among the ground forces and the civilians who witnessed their defense over the skies of Luzon. On December 15 Capt. Villamor, Capt. Colin Kelly, and Lt. Gozar were personally awarded by Gen. Douglas MacArthur the Distinguished Service Cross for their valorous defense of the airspace above Manila. Lt. Gozar's wingmate, Lt. Godofredo Juliano on the other hand received the Gold Cross. Upon activation of War Plan Orange, the 6th Pursuit Squadron and the rest of the PAAC were ordered to destroy their aircraft inventory. Capt. Villamor and his unit were ordered to a strategic retreat to Bataan and transformed their mission to air defense. Capt. Villamor ordered his unit to rally in Bataan and take up infantry and air defense roles. He would join Gen. MacArthur and Pres. Manuel L. Quezon on the ferry to Fort Mills on Corregidor Island on December 24, 1941. Capt. Villamor and his unit were still hoping to receive new aircraft from Australia. However, the shipment of the Pensacola Convoy never came through. For leading his squadron, Villamor was twice cited by the United States Army for bravery, receiving the Distinguished Service Cross for actions on December 10, 1941 and an Oak Leaf Cluster in lieu of a second award of the Distinguished Service Cross (DSC) for actions on December 12, 1941. Villamor is the only Filipino to receive the DSC twice. On February 9, 1942, Capt. Villamor conducted a reconnaissance mission over occupied Cavite in a PT-13 escorted by four American P-40 Warhawks. No sooner, 6 Japanese Zeros appeared. Capt. Villamor's aircraft damaged but was still able to land it safely. One P-40 was lost at the cost of 4 Zeros. Capt. Villamor's mission proved to be a success, as the films were delivered, and the information was collated with the ground observers, and counterbattery fire was put into effect. =Intelligence service= General Douglas MacArthur (left) is shown pinning a Distinguished Service Cross on Villamor for heroism in the air. After his squadron was destroyed, Villamor continued his war against the Japanese as an intelligence officer. Having escaped the fall of the Philippine Islands, volunteering, Villamor received orders to return to the Philippines. Promoted to major, Villamor served as a commander in the Allied Intelligence Bureau. On December 27, 1942, Villamor was part of a team inserted by the submarine into the Philippines, making contact with Roy Bell on Negros.Mills, S.A., 2009, Stranded in the Philippines, Annapolis: Naval Institute Press, Villamor went on to work with Bell, who would then make contact with James M. Cushing in 1943. Establishing a chain of direct communication from the Philippines with General Douglas MacArthur in Australia, he coordinated the activities of various guerrilla movements in Luzon, Mindanao and the Visayas. Completing his mission Villamor returned to Australia. Villamor's reports from the field were met with indifference by some within the SWPA, but were later publicly lauded by President Eisenhower. After World War II, Villamor served with the Military Assistance Advisory Group in the State of Vietnam during 1951 and 1952, and once again in 1955. Death Ret. Col. Villamor died on October 28, 1971 in Georgetown University, Washington, D.C., United States, and was buried with military honors at the Libingan ng mga Bayani in Fort Bonifacio, Taguig, which is located about two kilometers from the Philippine Air Force Headquarters which bears his name. Awards Villamor Air Base Monument For his bravery as a pilot and ingenuity as an intelligence officer, President Ram√≥n Magsaysay awarded Lieutenant Col. Villamor the Medal of Valor, the highest Philippine military bravery decoration, on January 21, 1954. In addition, Villamor was a two time recipient of the Distinguished Service Cross, and one time recipient of the Distinguished Conduct Star. The Philippine Air Force's principal facility in Metro Manila which was first known as Nichols Field, then later Nichols Air Base, was renamed Col. Jes√∫s Villamor Air Base in his honor. =Distinguished Service Cross Citation= AWARDED FOR ACTIONS DURING World War II Service: Foreign Battalion: 6th Pursuit Squadron, Division: Philippine Army Air Corps Headquarters, U.S. Army Forces in the Far East, General Orders No. 48 (1941) > The President of the United States of America, authorized by Act of Congress > July 9, 1918, takes pleasure in presenting the Distinguished Service Cross > to Captain (Air Corps) Jesus A.

The King granted the lands to Henry de Lacy, the Earl of Lincoln, who began to build a new walled town, colonised by immigrants from England, protected by a substantial castle and surrounded by deer parks for hunting. The work had not been completed by 1294, when the Welsh temporarily seized the castle during the Madog ap Llywelyn revolt. The defences continued to be improved, although the castle was not completely finished by the time of Henry's death in 1311. The castle passed between various owners in the first half of the 14th century, before coming under the control of the Mortimer family. Meanwhile, the walled town had proved impractical to live in, and a newer, much larger, settlement developed outside the defences. In 1400, the walled town was raided during the Glynd≈µr Rising, although the castle itself remained secure throughout the rebellion. During the Wars of the Roses, Denbigh was attacked by Lancastrian forces; the walled town was attacked and burnt. In the aftermath, the old town was largely abandoned by its inhabitants, the walled area becoming an extension of the castle's defences. During the English Civil War, Denbigh was held by the Royalists until it was taken in 1646 following a Parliamentary siege. The castle was seized by Royalist soldiers in 1659, after which General George Monk ordered it to be slighted, with various parts of the walls and towers being demolished. The site deteriorated further over the years and the old walled town remained almost deserted. In the middle of the 19th century, the town created a committee to manage the ruins and carried out restoration work. The central government's Office of Works took over responsibility for the fortifications in 1914, with the site ultimately passing into the control of the Welsh Cadw heritage agency. Denbigh Castle is dominated by a triangle of three octagonal towers that forms its main entrance, considered by the historian John Goodall to be \\"the most architecturally sophisticated gatehouse of the thirteenth century\\". Eight mural towers protect the rest of its curtain wall, further protected by barbicans and a mantlet of defensive terraces and walls. The castle connects to the town walls, which remain largely intact and stretch for around 1,100 metres (3,600 ft) around the old town. The town walls were once protected by four towers and two gatehouses, although only one of the gatehouses still survives. The castle and town's gatehouse were constructed of decorative stonework, intended to symbolise royal authority and civic pride. History =13th century= The exterior of the castle's gatehouse, showing the Porter's Lodge Tower (left) and the Prison Tower (right) Denbigh Castle was constructed within what was originally the Welsh patrimony of Perfeddwlad.; The patrimony controlled the pastoral farming lands on the Denbigh Moors and formed a royal residence, llys, for the Welsh princes. Perfeddwlad was strategically located along the Welsh border but its ownership was disputed and the territory was fought over by the Normans and Welsh many times during the 11th and 12th centuries.; In 1277, the Welsh prince Dafydd ap Gruffudd was granted Perfeddwlad by the English king, Edward I, who at the time was allied with Dafydd in his struggle against his brother Prince Llywelyn. Dafydd rebuilt the existing residence, creating a substantial castle.; ; It is uncertain what form it took or exactly where on the current castle site it was located, but it included a bakehouse, buttery, chapel and a hall, and it became Dafydd's main stronghold. The Welsh called the settlement Dinbych, an abbreviation of Dinas Fechan, meaning \\"little fortress\\". In 1282, Dafydd and Llywelyn rebelled against the King. Edward invaded North Wales with a huge army; after a month long siege, Dinbych fell to his forces in October 1282.; The King created a new lordship to govern the district around Dinbych, which he renamed Denbigh and granted these lands to Henry de Lacy, the Earl of Lincoln. With the help of James of St George, the King's master mason, Edward and Henry made plans for the construction of a new castle to govern the area, symbolically placed on top of the former llys.; Edward continued into Snowdonia, leaving Henry to continue the work at Denbigh, using local labourers and possibly men brought from Henry's estates in England. The western and southern sides of the castle and the new town walls were built first, in order to protect the construction teams and by 1285, Henry gave the new town its first charter. Work on the rest of the defences continued for several years. The castle and town formed part of a wider landscape controlled by de Lacey, including a nearby manor, a dovecote, barn and fishponds, which were all important symbols of lordship during the period.; He similarly established three parks around the castle, stocked with deer from England. The town walls enclosed an area approximately in size and held 63 burgesses in 1285, each of which promised to provide an armed man to help protect the settlement.; ; The townsfolk were English, many from Henry's estates in northern England and were reinforced by further English colonists who acquired large areas of rural land around the region.; From the earliest days of the new settlement; the inhabitants began to spread out beyond the walls onto the flatter ground further down the hill, spurred on by the limited space and poor water supply in the inner town.; ; This was unusual compared to the experience of other walled towns established in Wales at the time and within fifty years the external villa mercatoria had come to cover around .; The building work on Denbigh Castle had not been completed by September 1294, when a Welsh revolt broke out, led by Madog ap Llywelyn.; The castle was taken by Welsh forces, despite efforts by Henry to relieve it and the fortification was not recaptured until December. The castle's defences continued to be improved, although it was not completely finished, possibly because the project was disrupted by the death of Henry's eldest son in an accident at the castle. =14th ‚Äì 16th centuries= The exterior of the town's Burgess Gate, showing its distinctive defensive glacis spurs Henry de Lacy's daughter, Alice, inherited Denbigh Castle on his death in 1311. Alice was the wife of Thomas, the Earl of Lancaster, and the castle continued to be developed until Thomas was executed for treason in 1322. The following years were politically unstable and the castle was passed between several, short-lived, owners - Hugh Despenser, the Earl of Winchester and then Roger Mortimer, the Earl of March - before being held for a period by William Montagu. Work on the castle and the town walls continued throughout this period. The Mortimer family reacquired the lordship in 1355 and carried out repairs over the next fifty years to the castle's stonework and timber. In 1400, Owain Glynd≈µr led a revolt against the Crown and raided the town of Denbigh. Since Edmund Mortimer was only eight years old, King Henry IV placed Henry Percy in charge of Denbigh, until Percy defected to the rebels in 1403. Despite being isolated, Denbigh remained in royal hands through to the end of the rebellion in 1407. Edmund continued to hold the castle until he died, childless, in 1425, when ownership passed to Richard, the Duke of York. During the Wars of the Roses, Denbigh was fought over by the rival Lancastrian and Yorkist factions. Jasper Tudor, the Earl of Pembroke and a Lancastrian supporter, was declared the constable of the castle by Henry VI in 1457 but the fortification remained in the hands of the Yorkists.; After the Lancastrian victory at the Battle of Ludford Bridge, Jasper was able to force the garrison to surrender and finally took possession of the castle in 1460.; ; The war then turned in favour of the Yorkists and despite the castle's new garrison holding out for several months under Roger Puleston, it was recaptured by Sir Richard Herbert in late 1461.; ; The new Yorkist regime made William Herbert, Jasper's rival to the title of Earl of Pembroke, the constable and steward of Denbigh in 1467. Jasper returned to Denbigh in 1468 and although he could not take the castle, he burnt the interior of the walled town. The attack spurred an exodus from the walled town to the newer suburbs. By the end of 16th century the inner area had been largely abandoned, coming to form part of the external defences of the castle and the Burgess Gate on the town walls became the town gaol.; In 1586, the antiquarian William Camden could observe that the \\"old town is now deserted\\". Much of the castle had fallen into decline by 1530 but six years later the castle became the centre for administrating the new county of Denbighshire, with the great gatehouse and nearby towers being used as a courthouse, prison and associated buildings by the county authorities. The remainder of the castle had fallen into ruin by 1561. Robert Dudley, later made the Earl of Leicester, was granted a lease of the castle in 1563, partially because the Crown was trying to reduce the costs of maintaining the dilapidated property. Dudley built a large church in the walled town, possibly intending it to become a cathedral and carried out some minor repairs to the castle but little other work was carried out before his death in 1588.; =17th century= The North-Eastern Tower on the town walls When civil war broke out in 1642 between the followers of King Charles I and Parliament, Colonel William Salesbury held Denbigh Castle for the Royalists. The castle was defended by a garrison of 500 men and Salesbury paid for work to be carried out to refortify the site. The war turned against the Royalists and the King stayed at Denbigh for three days on his retreat from the Battle of Rowton Heath in September 1645. The following month, a Royalist army under the command of Sir William Vaughan gathered at Denbigh Green, close to the ruins of Denbigh Friary, intending to march to Chester to relieve the forces under siege there. Before this, Vaughan was attacked and defeated by a force commanded by Sir Thomas Mytton, and some of the Royalist soldiers retreated into the castle in the aftermath. Mytton took the outer parts of Denbigh but could not break into the walled town or the castle. Mytton returned the next year with additional equipment and placed the castle and the walled town under a close siege in April 1646, erecting earthwork bastions for his guns along the eastern site of Denbigh. The Goblin Tower along the town walls, which contained the garrison's main well, was bombarded with artillery and Mytton placed more guns on nearby Galch Hill to attack the south-western side of the walls. With only one artillery piece of his own and no Royalist reinforcements likely, Salesbury's position appeared hopeless but he held on, arguing that he had given assurances to the King that he would not surrender the castle.; Finally, Charles I sent Salebsury a message, personally ordering him to give up Denbigh; after negotiations, Salesbury agreed to surrender on good terms on 26 October. After Salesbury departed, Parliament installed a small garrison in the castle, under the command of Colonel George Twistleton, the new governor.; It was used as a prison for political prisoners, including David Pennant, the High Sheriff of Flintshire and there was an abortive Royalist attempt in 1648 to break into the castle to rescue the inmates.; In 1659, Sir George Booth led an uprising of Royalist and Presbyterian leaders against the Commonwealth government. A group of Royalist soldiers seized Denbigh Castle in August and took the garrison prisoner.; After Booth's defeat at the Battle of Winnington Bridge a few weeks later, the rebels surrendered and the government retook the castle.; General George Monck then ordered it to be slighted, put beyond military use. The republican politician John Carter demolished parts of the curtain walls and two towers over the course of six weeks.; The site fell further into ruin over the remainder of the century, with its stone being reused to build houses in the town. When granted briefly in 1696 to William Bentinck, the Earl of Portland, complaints were made in Parliament and it reverted to the Crown. =18th ‚Äì 21st centuries= slighted ruins of the castle Denbigh Castle remained ruined, although a new grammar school was built in the walled town in 1726 and a bowling green was established around 1769. Castle House,Castle House is also known as by its Welsh name of Plas Castell in the 21st century. a large private dwelling, was also constructed there in either the second quarter or the middle of the century, using stone taken from the castle ruins and Leicester's church. In the middle of the 19th century, the historian John Williams observed that the walled town remained otherwise deserted, with only three irregular rows of cottages, holding a total of 163 inhabitants; these dwellings attracted complaint from the writer Samuel Lewis, who argued that they \\"materially diminished the interest excited by the ruins\\".; The western tower of the Burgess Gate was then being used as a private house, as had the eastern tower until a few years before. In the middle of the 19th century, the town created a \\"Castle Committee\\" to maintain the ruins; the Crown leased the committee control of the castle and in 1879 lent them ¬£300 to fund repairs to the ruins.; The Crown reclaimed control of the Burgess Gate from its occupants and carried out conservation work, before then leasing the gatehouse to the committee in 1908.; In 1914, the central government's Office of Works took over responsibility for the site and during the late 1950s, its successor organisation, the Ministry of Works, first bought and then demolished various later buildings along the walls to clear the area for research and visitors. In the 21st century, Denbigh Castle and the town walls are maintained by the Welsh heritage agency Cadw. The castle is open to visitors, receiving 10,154 in 2015 and parts of the extant walls are also open to visitors. for visitor numbers. ¬£600,000 was invested by Cadw in the castle and walls during the mid-2010s, financing the construction of a new visitors' centre. The site is protected under UK law as a scheduled ancient monument and the castle as a grade I listed building.; Architecture =Castle= Plan of the castle; A - Red Tower; B - Prison Tower; C - Porter's Lodge Tower; D - Bishop's Tower; E - Badnes Tower; F - Great Hall; G - Great Kitchen Tower; H - Tower-next- Treasure-House; I - pigeon house; J - Green Chambers; K - White Chamber and Pitcher House towers; L - Treasure House Tower; M - Upper Gate and Postern Tower Denbigh Castle is located on a naturally defensible, rocky outcrop above the Clywd valley, with the walled town just beneath it to the north.; The castle comprises a large gatehouse, with a curtain wall and mural towers encircling an inner area approximately across. The historian John Goodall considers the fortification to be \\"one of the outstanding architectural creations of the Welsh conquest\\". The Great Gatehouse is formed by a triangle of octagonal towers around a central octagonal hall, protected by a barbican. The gatehouse was built using decorative bands of masonry in different colours, intended to symbolise Edward I's royal authority and displayed a statue, probably of Edward II, over the main entrance. The complex was defended with a wide ditch, a drawbridge, murder holes and a portcullis.; The three towers making up the gatehouse have individual names: the Porter's Lodge and Prison towers face outwards and the Badnes Tower, possibly named after an early constable of the castle, lies to the rear. Goodall considers the building to be \\"the most architecturally sophisticated gatehouse of the thirteenth century\\" and notes that the architectural ideas were later \\"reworked to brilliant effect\\" at Knaresborough.; To the east of the gatehouse is the site of the Queen's Chapel, since destroyed and the castle well, which is over deep.; The hexagonal, three-storey Great Kitchen Tower and the White Chamber Tower, which was slighted after the English Civil War, flank the foundations of the Great Hall. Further south is the Pitcher House Tower, probably used for storing water during the summer months and the Green Chambers, so called because of the colour of their Gwespyr stonework. The chambers have basements specially designed for the storage of meat and wine and the upper storeys originally contained exceptionally fine accommodation. At the southern end of the castle, the Postern Tower, originally three storeys high, links the castle to one end of the town walls. The adjacent Upper Gate and the Postern Gate formed a rear entrance to the castle, protected by another barbican, drawbridges and a steep passageway. A mantlet of defensive terraces and cross-walls stretches around the south and eastern sides of the castle and originally prevented the undermining of the mural towers and thinnest stretches of the curtain wall. This side of the castle was protected by the Treasure House Tower, which held the Treasure House; the Tower-next- Treasure House; the Bishop's Tower, containing a sally port and the octagonal Red Tower, named after the red sandstone used in its construction, which linked to the other end of the town wall circuit.; Stables, a blacksmith's workshop and storehouses once ran along the inside of the south-western corner of the castle. =Town walls= Plan of castle and town walls; A - Burgess Gate; B - North-Eastern Tower; C - Lord Leicester's Church; D - Countess Tower; Exchequer Gate; F - St Hilary's Chapel; G - Goblin Tower; H - castle The town walls stretch for around from the north edge of the castle to its southeastern tip and mostly remain intact. The walls were built in the 13th century and originally protected by four mural towers, positioned in a disorderly pattern; the two gatehouses and the defences along the eastern salient were added in the 14th century.; Only the foundations of the Exchequer Gate on the western side of the walls remain but the gatehouse would originally have been protected by two circular towers, with a rectangular glacis base to prevent undermining. The walls between the Exchequer and Burgess Gate at the north-west corner of the circuit are intact. The Burgess Gate has two circular towers protecting a vaulted passage way, again with a distinctive glacis base.; The gatehouse is built from white limestone and yellow sandstone, with the stonework forming a chequered design; this was a common decorative approach at the time and would have symbolised local civic pride.; Although the top courses have been lost, the gatehouse might originally have stood up to tall. The section of the walls to the east of the Burgess Gate has been lost. The walled circuit recommences in the north-east corner of the town, where the walls survive up to high, further protected by the two-storey tall North-Eastern Tower.; On the eastern side of the walls, the original defences had been set back from the edge of a rocky salient, protected by the Countess Tower, an angular, two-storey building with two towers.; The defences were adapted to follow the outer edge of the salient, with the Goblin Tower built on the outermost point, overlooking the edge of the cliffs. The Goblin Tower is a hexagonal, two-storey tower, protecting a deep well that formed the only reliable source of water for the defences during the summer. The walled circuit continues south, meeting the Bastion Tower in the south-east corner. The Bastion Tower was originally three storeys tall and was decorated with chequered sandstone and limestone in a similar fashion to the Burgess Gate.

Under the Counties (Detached Parts) Act 1844, many of these exclaves were absorbed by the counties within which they were located. The process was based on a schedule attached to the Parliamentary Boundaries Act 1832, drawn up by a boundary commission headed by the surveyor Thomas Drummond.The Statutes of the United Kingdom, Vols 30, 34 1832 p. 816 Nevertheless, a number of exclaves remained; these were dealt with in a piecemeal manner over a period of decades. The Local Government Act 1894 empowered the county councils of administrative counties to exchange areas in order to make a more effective local government area. As the Local Government Act 1888 had redefined the lieutenancy and shrievalty to be based on administrative counties, the changes also affected them as well as judicial boundaries. Accordingly, many anomalies in county boundaries were removed in the next three years, including the elimination of outlying areas of Derbyshire and Huntingdonshire. The last major transfer of areas was in 1931, when the boundaries of Gloucestershire, Warwickshire, and Worcestershire were realigned. Following the creation of a new administrative county of Huntingdon and Peterborough in 1965, and boundary changes at Dudley in 1966, Lancashire and Flintshire were left as the only counties with detached areas ‚Äî these remained right up to the abolition of the county council in 1974.  Terminology  * Exclave ‚Äì part of a county completely detached from its main territory, and surrounded by territory of another county or counties. * Satellite exclave ‚Äì many exclaves were accompanied by smaller ones, ranging from field strips of a fraction of an acre (see Donisthorpe under Derbyshire, below) to farms of a couple of hundred acres (see Caversfield under Buckinghamshire). Small exclaves were usually close to the main exclave or to the main county boundary; it was rare to find them at a substantial distance from other territory belonging to their county (see Borden Wood under Hampshire for an example). * Counter-exclave ‚Äì an exclave of the surrounding county within an exclave. Also known as a second-order exclave. * Counter- counter exclave ‚Äì a county had an exclave in another county which had a counter-exclave within it, and within this was an exclave of the same county as the first exclave. Also known as a third-order exclave. There used to be one in Wales (see Caernarvonshire in the list), and ten in the Shropshire exclave of Halesowen. * Enclave ‚Äì a \\"hole\\" in a county's territory created by an exclave of another county. Note that not all exclaves are enclaves, as the former might be on the border between two other counties. * Counter-enclave ‚Äì a portion of the surrounding county within the territory of an enclave. * Semi-exclave ‚Äì part of a county detached by land from its main territory, but on a marine coastline which the latter also abuts. * Riparian semi-exclave ‚Äì found where a river or river estuary forms the boundary between two counties, and one county has territory on the \\"wrong\\" side of the river which is only accessible directly from that county by using a boat. These are usually, but not always, caused by the river changing course (for example, by cutting off a meander to create an oxbow lake). However, there were three examples on the other side of a tidal estuary through which a county boundary ran, two in Kent and one in Cornwall (q.v.). These riparian semi-exclaves are not legally true exclaves, because rivers and estuaries are county territory in English law. * Salient ‚Äì a protrusion of a county's territory into that of another county or counties. * Pene-exclave ‚Äì a salient which cannot be accessed by public right of way except through another county. These usually have a narrow \\"neck\\" joining the salient to the main territory. In England they can be distinguished as \\"vehicular\\" (bridlepath and footpath access only), \\"equestrian\\" (footpath access only) or \\"pedestrian\\" (no direct access). * Divided parish ‚Äì county boundaries usually coincided with parish ones, but not invariably. The former could run through parishes, and many county exclaves and salients divided parishes in this way. * Parish exclave ‚Äì exclaves belonging to parishes used to be more common than those of counties. A county exclave might contain one or more parishes if large, but might also include parish exclaves. Small county exclaves were usually parish exclaves as well, but not invariably: see \\"Monks House\\" under County Durham below. * County corporate ‚Äì Twenty towns and cities in England and Wales had the historical status of County corporate, making them equivalent to counties. The majority became county boroughs in 1888. Thirteen of them were enclaves within their counties. Two of them, Chester and Norwich, contained counter-enclaves of their counties.  Areas transferred  = Total number of exclaves = The following list has 204 exclaves in total, including 11 semi-exclaves with a coastline and generating 76 legal issues. The semi-exclaves were in Caernarvonshire, Denbighshire, Devon, County Durham and Lancashire. Riparian semi-exclaves are not counted. After 1844, 106 exclaves survived which amounted to 28 surviving legal issues (multi-parish exclaves counted singly). The 1844 Act resulted in a list of individual legal enactments targeting boundary anomalies. It counted a set of exclaves belonging to a single parish or township as a single legal issue. Conversely, a single exclave containing territory of two parishes was treated as two legal issues. Counter-exclaves were not regarded as separate legal issues, because they vanished when the exclave concerned was abolished. In contrast, after 1844 legal issues concerning exclaves could be bundled together and dealt with by a single legal order, as happened in the 1931 re-ordering of the boundaries of Gloucestershire, Worcestershire and Warwickshire. = Bedfordshire = The county had one exclave after 1844, and eight abolished then (pre-1844 total 9, legal 3; post-1844 total 1, legal 1): * Aspley Heath (1). This was an exclave separated from the county's main territory by the width of a highway. The exclave was eliminated by the annexation of territory from Buckinghamshire to create a civil parish in 1883.Ordnance Survey 6 inch sheet Buckinghamshire XV 1885VCH Bedfordshire p. 338 Abolished in 1844: * Meppershall (1). The Hertfordshire exclave of Meppershall contained a small counter-enclave, on the south side of Fildyke Road near the junction with Chapel Road. This was abolished when the exclave was annexed.Ordnance Survey First Series sheet 46 * Shillington (6). Exclaves of the parish of Shillington, Bedfordshire in Hertfordshire were transferred to the latter. There were five small ones in fields of Pirton next to Oughtonhead Common, the largest being of very irregular shape and another containing a counter-exclave of Hertfordshire. A sixth contained Shillington Mill at Ickleford.Ordnance Survey First Series sheet 46 1834Ordnance Survey 6 inch sheets Hertfordshire VI, VII 1884 * Whipsnade (1). Balligdon Bottom, 160 acres (65 ha), an exclave of Whipsnade parish in Beechwood Park. Ordnance Survey 6 inch Hertfordshire sheet XXVI 1884 The area remained a parish exclave until it was added to Markyate parish in 1897. Beechwood had been a wooded common in Anglo-Saxon times shared by several villages, and the exclave was granted to Whipsnade in exchange for its rights when the Benedictine nunnery of \\"St Giles in the Wood\\" was founded on the common in the 12th century.Rowe & Williamson:Hertfordshire, A Landscape History 2013 p. 100 = Berkshire = The county had no exclaves after 1844, and three were abolished then (pre-1844 total 3, legal 3; post-1844 total 0): * Great Barrington (1). Part of the parish of Great Barrington, otherwise in Gloucestershire and the exclave was transferred to it. This ran the width of the parish along the north bank of the River Windrush, and the boundary ran through the village. This exclave was not shown on the first Ordnance Survey, so is not on the online \\"Historical County Boundaries Project\\" map.Ordnance Survey First Series Sheet 44 * Langford and Little Faringdon (1). Langford and Little Faringdon townships (now civil parishes), together forming an exclave transferred to Oxfordshire. Samuel Lewis 1803 wrote that only part of Langford township belonged to Berkshire, with the county boundary running through the parish church.Lewis, Samuel: A Topographical Dictionary of England 1840 p. 19. The \\"Historic County Boundaries Project\\" has the whole township in Berkshire, following the first Ordnance Survey.Ordnance Survey First Series Sheet 34 * Shilton (1). Most of the parish of Shilton formed an exclave transferred to Oxfordshire. The parish had its own exclave comprising a 7 acre (2.8 ha) meadow next to the River Windrush south-east of Witney, which was already in Oxfordshire.Ordnance Survey 6 inch sheet Oxfordshire XXXII 1883 Two pene- exclaves were abolished after 1844: * That part of the divided parish of Inglesham in Berkshire was transferred to Wiltshire to join the rest in 1844. It contained part the village, while the church was in a small exclave of Wiltshire. The south part of the parish with the hamlet of Upper Inglesham was also in Wiltshire. The pene-enclave was a large field by the River Thames north-west of Upper Inglesham, inaccessible directly from Berkshire. The boundary survived for parliamentary purposes into the latter 19th century.Ordnance Survey 6 inch sheet Berkshire VII 1883Shalbourne salient of Berkshire, briefly in Wiltshire 1844 (Historic County Borders Project) * The parish of Shalbourne was divided between Berkshire and Wiltshire, the former having the parish church and the tithing of Oxenwood. The long, narrow and irregularly shaped salient was transferred to Wiltshire and the parish united only in 1895. Oxenwood was included in the 1844 Act by mistake, as it was erroneously listed as an exclave. The relevant Order was cancelled after the error was pointed out.Grose, D: The Flora of Wiltshire 1957 p. 58 Riparian semi-exclaves at Oxford: * The River Thames was selected as the northern boundary of the county, but from north of Wytham past Oxford to beyond the mouth of the River Cherwell the river subsequently changed its course. At the city centre, this left a strip of territory on the north bank in Berkshire. Included were Folly Bridge Island and an area north of Folly Bridge, adjacent to two riparian semi-enclaves. The first was Deans Ham, in between the river and Christ Church Meadown. The second was Aston's Eyot, the other side of the old channel of the Cherwell and including what is now \\"Boathouse Island\\". These areas were annexed to Oxford when it became a county borough in 1890.Ordnance Survey 6 inch sheet Berkshire VI 1886 However, the boundary between the Roman Catholic Archdiocese of Birmingham and the Roman Catholic Diocese of Portsmouth continues to follow the old county boundary to the present day. = Buckinghamshire = The county had four exclaves after 1844, and five abolished then (pre-1844 total 9, legal 6; post-1844 total 4, legal 2): * Drayton Beauchamp (2). Two exclaves of the parish of Drayton Beauchamp were transferred to Hertfordshire, and annexed to the parish of Tring in 1886. The larger was Whittle Farm, 106 acres (43 ha) and the other a field of 5.4 acres (2.2 ha) on Cheddington Lane east of Long Marston which is now most of the village cricket club.Ordnance Survey First Edition sheet 46Ordnance Survey 6 inch sheet Buckinghamshire XXIX 1884Divided Parishes and Poor Law Amendment Act 1882, Local Government Board Order 19622 25 March 1883Small exclaves of Buckinghamshire in Hertfordshire, at Long Marston. (Historical County Borders Project) * Marsworth (2). Two exclaves of the parish of Marsworth were transferred to Hertfordshire. The larger was a group of fields by the hamlet of Astrope of 52 acres (21 ha), and the other was a strip of land in Long Marston village, 2.2 acres (0.9 ha). The former was annexed to the parish of Puttenham and the latter to that of Tring in 1886.Ordnance Survey First Edition sheet 46Ordnance Survey 6 inch sheet Buckinghamshire XXIX 1884Divided Parishes and Poor Law Amendment Act 1882, Local Government Board Order 19622 25 March 1883 Abolished in 1844: * Caversfield (3). The parish of Caversfield was transferred to Oxfordshire, comprising one major exclave and two satellite exclaves. As well as the main bloc of territory of 1278 acres (516 ha), there was an exclave of 216 acres (87 ha) comprising fields to the east, and one of 3.6 acres (1.45 ha) comprising the south-east side of the village street of Stratton Audley. The two parish exclaves were transferred to the parish of Stratton Audley in 1888.Ordnance Survey 6 inch sheets Oxfordshire XVII, XXIII 1888 revised Before enclosure, in 1770 the latter parish had an open-field system the strips of which were divided between itself and Caversfield in a complicated manner, and the county boundary followed this. The 216-acre exclave was a consolidation of the Caversfield strips. The 1832 schedule listed the two Stratton Audley exclaves as the \\"Chapelry of Stratton Audley\\", although there was never a chapel separate from the parish church, and this was treated as s separate legal case by the 1844 Act.The Statutes of the United Kingdom, Vols 30, 34 1832 p. 816 * Lillingstone Lovell (1). The parish of Lillingstone Lovell was united in Buckinghamshire. Formerly, the north part was an exclave of this county separated from the rest by an exclave of Oxfordshire which contained the village. * Luffield Abbey (1). The exclave of the extra-parochial territory of Luffield Abbey in Buckinghamshire was transferred to Northamptonshire and annexed to the parish of Silverstone. The territory had been in two portions, and the main portion remained in the former county. One pene-exclave was abolished after 1844: * A very irregularly shaped pene-exclave was wrapped around the Hertfordshire parish of Little Gaddesden. Hudnall to the east, a parish exclave of Edlesborough, was annexed to Little Gaddesden and Hertfordshire in 1885, and Nettleden to the south- east, which had been a parish exclave of Pitstone, was made a parish in Hertfordshire in 1895.Rowe & Williamson:Hertfordshire, A Landscape History 2013 p. 100 Three riparian semi-exclaves survived on the River Thames until fairly recently: *A lost meander north-east of Egham, Surrey left a portion of Buckinghamshire on the Surrey side of the river, at Woodhaw. The Runnymede Bridge was built across it in 1961.Ordnance Survey 6 inch sheet Surrey V 1872 * The village of Laleham had a parcel of land on the wrong side of the river, on Penton Hook.Ordnance Survey 6 inch sheet Middlesex XXIV 1869 * A lost meander at Windsor left Deadwater Ait as part of Buckinghamshire on the Windsor side of the river. This was abolished when Eton was annexed to Windsor in 1998.Ordnance Survey 6 inch sheet XXXII 1881 = Cambridgeshire = The historical county had no exclaves, with one dubious exception: * The Liberty of Ely Place, adjacent to the City of London in Holborn. There are many online and printed references to date, stating that this was an exclave of Cambridgeshire until the formation of the London Borough of Camden in 1964.Vitaliev, V: Passport to Enclavia, Travels in Search of a European Identity 2008 p. 13 The evidence is alleged to be that the licence of its pub, the \\"Olde Mitre\\", was obtained from the Cambridgeshire magistrates not the Middlesex ones. The liberty marked the site of the \\"Inn\\" (that is, the London town house or palace) of the Bishop of Ely in the Middle Ages, hence the Cambridgeshire connection. The story was debunked in print by H. V. Morton in 1940, and lacks reliable citations.Morton, H. V: Ghosts of London 1940 p. 89 = Caernarvonshire = The county had two exclaves after 1844 (pre-1844 total 2, legal 1; post-1844 total 2, legal 1): * Llysfaen and Eirias (2). The county had a large (2711.4 acres or 1097 ha)The House of Lords 1873 p. 38 semi- exclave consisting of the parishes of Llysfaen and Eirias and including the town of Old Colwyn, which was transferred to the surrounding county of Denbighshire and the urban district of Colwyn Bay in 1923.Jones, I.W: Llandudno, Queen of the Welsh Resorts 2008 p. 129 In turn it surrounded a counter-semi-exclave of Denbighshire including the east part of Old Colwyn, which had very complex borders. This counter-semi-exclave in turn contained a counter-counter-semi-exclave of Caernarvonshire, that of \\"Coed-coch Cottage\\" covering 1.6 acres (0.65 ha).Ordnance Survey 6 inch Denbighshire III and IV 1875, with notesNested exclaves of Caernarvonshire (pink) and Denbighshire. (Historical County Borders Project) = Cheshire = The county had no exclaves in other counties. However, it did have a counter-enclave: * Chester Castle was an enclave of the county of Cheshire within the city of Chester, which in turn was historically a county corporate and so an enclave within Cheshire.County Boundary. Returns from Clerks of the Peace of Insulated Parcels of Land in the Accounts and Papers of the House of Commons Vol 21 1825, own page numbers p. 5 It comprised Chester Castle and some adjoining territory. The situation remained until 1974, the city having become a county borough in 1888. The territory remains a civil parish, with no inhabitants (2020). Riparian semi-exclaves: * River Dee. The border with Denbighshire between Aldford and Shocklach (the Welsh-English border) runs along the River Dee, but this river meanders at will. Dropped meanders mean that there are three riparian semi-enclaves of Cheshire near Shocklach. Since this is a national boundary, they have been left alone.Ordnance Survey Landranger map 117. *River Mersey. The border with Lancashire ran along the River Mersey, but the river had many meanders and was liable to change its course. This left many portions of both counties on the wrong side of it.Ordnance Survey 6 inch Cheshire IX 1882 Most of the border has been superseded, but a portion remains between the boroughs of Stockport and Tameside south of Denton, and this still illustrates the problem.Ordnance Survey Landranger sheet 109 = Cornwall = The county had one riparian semi-exclave after 1844: * Saltash. Historically the county has had only one detached portion, a riparian semi-exclave on the east, Devon side of the estuary of the River Tamar estuary opposite Saltash. This meant that the ancient ferry there had both ends in Cornwall. The area belonged to Saltash, St Stephen parish, but was transferred to St Budeaux parish and Devon after 1844.Wallis, J: The Cornwall Register 1847 p. 252Statutes of the UK Vols 30, 34 1832 p. 817 = Denbighshire = The county had two exclaves and three semi-exclaves after 1844, and one abolished then (pre-1844 total 6, legal 2; post-1844 total 5, legal 1): * Llandrillo yn Rhos (5) The major semi-exclave of Caernarfonshire (see above) contained a semi- exclave of Denbighshire including the east part of Old Colwyn. This in turn had two satellite semi-exclaves north of Penmaen-Rh√¥s, separated by a very narrow corridor. In addition, it was accompanied by two small satellite exclaves forming thin strips south-east of Old Colwyn. This total of five detached portions of Denbighshire, 139 acres (56 ha), belonged to the parish of Llandrillo yn Rhos. It was annexed to the semi-enclave of Caernarfonshire in 1879.Ordnance Survey 6 inch Denbighshire III and IV 1875, with notesThe House of Lords 1873 p. 38 One exclave was abolished in 1844: * Carreghofa (1). The township of Carreghofa was on the English border, and included the Welsh half of the divided village of Llanymynech. Riparian semi-exclaves: The River Dee formed the border from near Chester to near Chirk, but was liable to change course and drop meanders.

A block of parishes formed a large exclave of Derbyshire in Leicestershire: Appleby Magna North (partly in Leicestershire), Chilcote, Measham, Oakthorpe and Donisthorpe (partly in Leicestershire), Stretton en le Field and Willesley This was transferred to Leicestershire 1897. At the same time, the parishes of Netherseal and Overseal were received from Leicestershire in compensation. The village of Appleby Magna had been divided between the two counties, with three satellite exclaves of Derbyshire and four small counter-exclaves of Leicestershire. The fields of Donisthorpe had been allotted to the two counties in a very complicated manner, featuring irregular interlocking salients with five satellite exclaves of Derbyshire and twelve counter- exclaves of Leicestershire.Ordnance Survey 6 inch sheet XXII 1884 with notesPoulton-Smith, A: Leicestershire and Rutland Place Names 2008 p. 98 * Edingale (3). The village Edingale was divided between Derbyshire and Staffordshire, with two townships of the same name belonging to Croxall and Alrewas. Derbyshire had three exclaves, and Staffordshire three. All were abolished when Edingale civil parish was created in 1936 and put in Staffordshire.VCH Staffordshire Vol. 4 p. 58 * Packington and Ravenstone (17). The parish of Packington in Leicestershire included the chapelry of Snibston as a large parish exclave to the east, separated by the parish of Ravenstone. The main body of Packington contained three exclaves of Derbyshire (two meeting at a point), with ten satellite exclaves. Ravenstone had one larger exclave (including much of the village), and Snibston had three. All seventeen exclaves were transferred to Leicestershire in 1844, the latter four forming part of the new parish of Ravenstone with Snibston. Packington was adjacent to the large Derbyshire exclave listed below.Youngs, F.A: Guide to the Administrative Units of England 1979 p. 1916Derbyshire (in blue) and Leicestershire at Donisthorpe. (Historical County Borders Project) One exclave was abolished in 1844: * Foston and Scropton (1).

These comprised the tithing of Vaultershome, the larger one including the hamlets of Dodbrook, Kingsand and Cremyll and the smaller being an estate called Mendenick near St John.Wallis, J: The Cornwall Register 1847 p. 299 * Thorncombe with Beerhall and Easthay (1). The exclave containing the parish of Thorncombe was transferred to Dorset. It also contained the tithing of Beerhall and Easthay, a parish exclave belonging to Axminster which was treated as a separate legal issue by the 1844 Act. Somehow, the schedule of Orders generated by the Act had this portion of Axminster transferred from Dorset to Devon. Rather, it ended up as a detached portion of the parish in Dorset until added to Thorncombe. = Dorset = The county had no exclaves after 1844, and one was abolished then (pre-1844 total 1, legal 1; post-1844 total 0): * Stockland and Dalwood (1).

The district of Bedlingtonshire, basically the parish of Bedlington, was transferred to Northumberland. * Craikshire (1). The district of Craikshire, basically the parish of Crayke, was transferred to the North Riding of Yorkshire. This was the only true exclave * Islandshire and Norhamshire (1). A large triangular semi-exclave occupying the right bank of the River Tweed downstream from Cornhill-on-Tweed and the coastline from Tweedmouth to Budle Bay, but excluding Berwick-upon-Tweed which was a county in its own right. Lindisfarne and the Farne Islands were included. The area consisted of three administrative units, Norhamshire, Islandshire and the extra-parochial Farne Islands. Transferred to Northumberland. Counted as two legal issues by the 1844 Act. * Monks' House (1). The farmstead of Monks' House was a semi-enclave of 0.6 acres (0.24 ha) at Bamburgh, forming an extra- parochial district. It functioned as a mainland port for the monks living on Inner Farne, being donated for this purpose in 1257 by King Henry III.The Reliquary Vol. 13 1873 p. 28 This is the smallest separately administered exclave in this list.

Historically there were eight (pre-1844 total 8, legal 4; post-1844 total 8, legal 4): * Abenbury Fechan (5). The township of Abenbury Fechan, east of Wrexham, consisted of one larger and four smaller exclaves totalling . The township was transferred to the Denbighshire township of Abenbury Fawr in 1885. The small exclaves were Woodbine Farm, Hullah Farm, Llwyn-on and Five Fords.http://maps.nls.uk/view/102341207 * English Maelor (1). The largest of the exclaves was the area of English Maelor or Maelor Saesneg, which became the Overton Rural District in 1894, and was renamed Maelor Rural District in 1953. * Marford-and-Hoseley (2). The second largest exclave was the township of Marford-and-Hoseley in the parish of Gresford (otherwise in Denbighshire), 589 acres (238.3 ha)The House of Lords 1873 p. 38. Originally this township had a satellite exclave called Marford Mill that included part of the village of Rossett, 15 acres (6 ha),The House of Lords 1873 p. 38 but this was transferred to the Denbighshire township of Allington in 1885. At the same date, small exclaves of Gresford township (to be distinguished from the parish) and Allington township were transferred from Denbighshire and added to the main Marford-and-Hoseley exclave. The former was Marford Wood, the latter a small estate called \\"The Elms\\". The augmented exclave became a parish in the Hawarden Rural District in 1894, although surrounded by Wrexham Rural District in Denbighshire. It remained an exclave of Flintshire until local government reorganisation in 1974, when the two rural districts mentioned were united in Wrexham Maelor.Ordnance Survey 6 inch Denbighshire sheets XXI and XXII, with notes 1878 Riparian semi-exclaves: The River Dee formed the border of Denbighshire with the exclave of English Maelor,Ordnance Survey 6 inch sheets Denbighshire XXIX Flintshire XXII 1879 but was liable to change course and drop meanders. As a result, there were riparian semi-exclaves on this border: * Part of Pickhill Meadows north-east of Bangor-on-Dee. * Across the river from Althrey Hall, one of a pair of lost meanders and so accompanying a riparian semi-exclave of Denbighshire. * The parish of Erbistock was divided between Denbighshire and Flintshire, with the latter portion forming an irregularly shaped salient on the wrong side of the river from English Maelor. It contained the parish church. The parish was consolidated within Denbighshire in 1897.Veysey A. G: Guide to the Parish Records of Clwyd 1984 p. 23 = Gloucestershire = After 1844, Gloucestershire had no true exclaves and six were abolished then (pre-1844 total 6, legal 6; post-1844 total 0). However, the north of the county had two pene-enclaves (that is, areas only accessible by public highway through another territory) which were only joined to the rest of the county by narrow necks of land. These became Marston Sicca Rural District, and portions of Campden Rural District and Pebworth Rural District in 1894. In 1931 the county's boundaries with Warwickshire and Worcestershire were realigned, removing the salients from Gloucestershire; in compensation, Gloucestershire gained a number of detached Worcestershire parishes. * The larger of the pene- exclaves contained Marston Sicca Rural District with six parishes: Clifford Chambers,Dorsington, Marston Sicca, Preston on Stour Welford-on-Avon andWeston-on-Avon; part of Pebworth Rural District, comprising the six parishes of Pebworth, Aston Subedge, Cow Honeybourne,Saintbury, Weston Subedge andWillersey; and part of Campden Rural District comprising the seven parishes of Admington, Chipping Campden, Clopton, Ebrington, Hidcote Bartrim, Mickleton and Quinton. * The smaller pene-exclave was a detached portion of Campden Rural District with the parishes of Lower Lemington and Todenham. Six exclaves were abolished in 1844: * Little Compton (1). The parish of Little Compton, transferred to Warwickshire. * Lea Lower (1). The parish of Lea, Herefordshire was divided into the townships of Lee Upper, Lea Bailey and Lea Lower, the last being in Gloucestershire and containing the parish church. It was transferred to Herefordshire, and the three townships made into civil parishes.Youngs, F. A: Guide to the Local Administrative Units of England 1979 p. 1878 The parish was united in 1883. * Minety (1). The parish of Minety, transferred to Wiltshire.

An exclave of the parish of Bramshott, known as Crouch House Farm, was transferred to the parish of Rogate in Sussex in 1895. * Steep (1). A three-acre exclave of the parish of Steep, located in Borden Wood in the parish of Chithurst in Sussex, was transferred to the latter parish in 1883. The area consisted of woodland only, with no inhabitants or cultivation.Hampshire's tiny exclave in a Sussex wood. A large exclave was abolished in 1844: * Ambersham (1). This was a tithing of the parish of Steep, and was a narrow strip of land running south from the Surrey border near Haslemere to near Graffham in Sussex. After 1844 it was divided into the civil parishes of South Ambersham and North Ambersham. = Herefordshire = The county had one exclave after 1844, and three were abolished then (pre-1844 total 5, legal 5; post-1844 total 1, legal 1): * Ffwddog (1).

The hamlet of Coleshill (in the parish of Amersham), transferred to Buckinghamshire. * Meppershall (3). The parts of the parish of Meppershall in Hertfordshire east of the village, transferred to Bedfordshire. The largest exclave, which divided the village, contained a small counter-exclave of Bedfordshire (q.v.) on the south south side of Fildyke Road near the junction with Chapel Road. The other two exclaves comprised meadows on the west border of the parish, one a long strip and another tiny.Ordnance Survey First Series sheet 46 * Pirton (1).

The parish of Swineshead was an exclave of the county surrounded by Bedfordshire, 1278 acres (517 ha)The House of Lords 1873 p. 38. In 1896, the parish was transferred to Bedfordshire in exchange for the parish of Tilbrook.Parliamentary Papers: 1850-1908 Vol. 4 p. 4 * Tetworth (1). The civil parish of Tetworth was in two parts, the southern being an exclave of Huntingdonshire separated from the rest of the county, 730 acres (295 ha) and the other half of the parish by a salient of Cambridgeshire. This situation remained until 1965, when the county of Huntingdon and Peterborough was formed, and parish and county boundaries were adjusted to remove the detached part. The exclave had been enlarged under the 1844 act by including part of Tetworth previously in Bedfordshire, which was a single irregularly-shaped field in the north-west corner of the exclave north of Biggin Wood.Ordnance Survey First Edition sheet 52 1835Ordnance Survey 6 inch sheet Cambridgeshre XLIV SE 1883 Oddly, the parish church of Everton, Bedfordshire was in this enclave (with half the village) and not in its civil parish. This was because Everton and Tetworth had always remained a single ecclesiastical parish.Ordnance Survey 6 inch Campridgeshire sheet LI 1887 = Kent = The county had two riparian semi-exclaves after 1844: * North Woolwich. The town and parish of Woolwich had two parcels of territory on the north bank of the Thames Estuary, surrounded by Essex. Before the 19th century these were just marshland, but in 1847 North Woolwich railway station was opened in the western, smaller one to give the town a railway route to London via a ferry. This created the settlement of North Woolwich. The two riparian semi-exclaves were transferred to the County of London with the town in 1889. Previously, the boundary between Kent and Essex ran along the middle of the estuary here. = Lancashire = hundreds of pre-1974 Lancashire, showing Lonsdale in two parts, separated by Morecambe Bay. The green outline shows the post-1974 boundaries of Lancashire. The historical county of Lancashire had no true exclaves, although a large part of it was separated from the rest at high tide and counted as a semi-exclave (total 1): * Furness (1). The North Lonsdale area of Lancashire, or \\"Lancashire North of the Sands\\", was cut off from the main body of Lancashire by Westmorland and Morecambe Bay, and so was regarded as a semi-enclave. However, Morecambe Bay dries out at low tide and an ancient right of way for wheeled traffic runs across it (presently in charge of the Queen's Guide to the Sands). The area was transferred to Cumbria by the Local Government Act 1972. Administrative exclave: * Lees Urban District was from 1889 an exclave of the administrative county of Lancashire, separated from the rest of the county by the County Borough of Oldham (shown within the Salford Hundred in the map to the right), and enclosed on the other side by Saddleworth Urban District in the West Riding of Yorkshire. The urban district was abolished by the Local Government Act 1972, taking effect on 1 April 1974, with its former area transferred to the newly created metropolitan county of Greater Manchester, along with much of Salford Hundred, to form part of the new Metropolitan Borough of Oldham, where it was also joined by Saddleworth. Riparian semi-exclaves: *River Mersey. The border with Lancashire ran along the River Mersey, but the river had many meanders and was liable to change its course. This left many portions of both counties on the wrong side of it.Ordnance Survey 6 inch Lancashire 110 1848 Most of the border has been superseded, but a portion remains between the boroughs of Stockport and Tameside south of Denton, and this still illustrates the problem.Ordnance Survey Landranger sheet 109 = Leicestershire = The county had no exclaves, except sixteen small counter-exclaves in its large enclave of Derbyshire (q.v.) (pre-1844 total 16, legal 0; post-1844 total 16, legal 0): * Appleby Magna (4). * Donisthorpe (12). = Lincolnshire = The county had three exclaves after 1844 (pre-1844 total 3 legal 1; post-1844 total 3, legal 1): * Misson (3). The parish of Misson was shared with Nottinghamshire, which had the village. Lincolnshire had one main exclave, Misson Springs, with two satellite exclaves of Highwood Farm and Lewes Farm. The latter was only separated from the main exclave by the width of Springs Road. The parish was consolidated within Nottinghamshire in 1886, despite being a riparian semi- exclave cut off from the rest of the county by the River Idle. = City of London = The City of London has kept its ancient boundaries, which have no exclaves. However, the entire length of Old London Bridge was in its territory, until it was demolished in 1831. Technically this left a short stretch of the River Thames tidal foreshore in Southwark as a riparian semi- exclave of the City, just east of the present London Bridge.Map of Medieval London, British Historic Towns Atlas 2019 = Middlesex and the County of London = There had been only one historical exclave of the county, abolished before 1844: * Liberty of St Martin's Le Grand. This had been a medieval college of secular canons, with a collegiate church, situated in the City of London parish of St Leonard, Foster Lane.Town & City Historical Maps: Map of Medieval London 2019 The college was taken over by Westminster Abbey in 1503 as part of the endowment granted for the upkeep of the Henry VII Chapel., and subsequently was regarded as part of the borough of Westminster up to the Reform Act 1832,Stanley, A.

Returns from Clerks of the Peace of Insulated Parcels of Land in the Accounts and Papers of the House of Commons Vol 21 1825, own page numbers p. 12. This was despite an Act of 1815 annexing the Liberty to the Aldersgate Ward of the City of London when the site was earmarked for a new General Post Office.Kempe, A. J: Historical Notices of the Collegiate Church Or Royal Free Chapel and Sanctuary of St. Martin-le-Grand, London 1825 p. 172 When the County of London was constituted in 1889, it was made up of parishes from Kent, Surrey and Middlesex. Whereas Middlesex had no county exclaves, it had several parish exclaves and three of these caused anomalies in the new county's boundaries: * One Middlesex parish, Clerkenwell, had a detached portion that became an exclave of London surrounded by Middlesex. The exclave comprised a area of north-central Muswell Hill, and occupied the east side of Hatch Lane from Muswell Hill Broadway as far north as the present Goodwyns Vale. Back then, it was parkland and contained the ancient Mus Well. In the Middle Ages, Clerkenwell Priory had charge of a chapel and shrine here of \\"Our Lady of Mus Well\\", hence the exclave. This was absorbed by Middlesex in 1899, having been built over and the well destroyed the previous year (it was at 40 Muswell Road).Ordnance Survey 6 inch sheet Middlesex XII 1873 * The ancient Middlesex parish of Hornsey had two small exclaves in the south-east corner of the parish of Stoke Newington, which were included in the South Hornsey Local Board in 1865. The formation of the County of London left these as enclaves within it, which were inherited by the South Hornsey Urban District in 1894. Then the whole of South Hornsey passed to the County of London in 1900. One exclave was a narrow strip of land, 5 acres (2 ha), from Newington Green along the west side of Albion Road to just short of Clissold Crescent. The other was an irregular shape of 60.5 acres (24 ha) made up of two quadrilaterals meeting at the junction of Allen Road and Neville Road, one occupying the area bounded by Matthias Road, Milton Road, Allen Road and Cowper Road, the other between Nevill Road and Stoke Newington Road.Ordnance Survey 6 inch sheet Middlesex XII 1873 * The County of London inherited the two riparian semi-enclaves of North Woolwich from Kent (q.v.), and these were abolished when the Borough of Newham was created in 1964. = Monmouthshire = The county had no exclaves after 1844, and one was abolished then (pre-1844 total 1, legal 1; post-1844 total 1, legal 1): * Welsh Bicknor, parish transferred to Herefordshire. = Montgomeryshire = The county had one exclave after 1844 (pre-1844 total 1 legal 1; post-1844 total 1, legal 1):Exclave of Montgomeryshire in England * Bausley (1). The parish of Bausley forms a Welsh salient into Shropshire, and had a small exclave comprising a farm called Stanford which was transferred to the latter county.Ordnance Survey First Edition sheet 60 This made Montgomeryshire an English county. There was a serious proposal to transfer Bausley to Shropshire in 1887,Bye-gones 1887 p. 65, thus annexing it to England, but the parish exclave was transferred to Wollaston instead. Riparian semi-exclaves: * The border with Shropshire between Llanymynech and Melverley (the Welsh-English border) runs along the River Vyrnwy, but this river meanders at will. Dropped meanders mean that there are six riparian semi- enclaves of Montgomeryshire, and four of Shropshire. Since this is a national boundary, they have been left alone.Ordnance Survey Landranger map 126. One of the Montgomeryshire semi-exclaves (the second from Llanymenech Bridge) was created after 1887 when the river changed course.Ordnance Survey 6 inch sheet Shropshire XXVI 1887 = Norfolk = The county had no exclaves in other counties, and very compact boundaries. However, it did have a counter-enclave: * Norwich Castle was an enclave of the county of Norfolk within the city of Norwich, which in turn was historically a county corporate and so an enclave within Norfolk.County Boundary. Returns from Clerks of the Peace of Insulated Parcels of Land in the Accounts and Papers of the House of Commons Vol 21 1825, own page numbers p. 13 It comprised Norwich Castle and some adjoining territory. = Northamptonshire = The county had eight small exclaves after 1844 (pre-1844 total 8, legal 1; post-1844 total 8, legal 1):Exclaves of Northamptonshire in Catford, also shows Swineshead exclave of Huntingdonshire. (Historic County Borders Project) * Great Catworth (8). The parish of Great Catworth in Huntingdonshire had eight small parcels of territory belonging to Northamptonshire. Ordnance Survey First Series, sheet 52 1835. These were thought to have been a property holding by Peterborough Abbey. The parish was consolidated with Little Catworth to make (just) Catworth in 1885. Pene- exclave: The parish of Lutton was divided between Northamptonshire and Huntingdonshire until 1886, when it was unified in the former county. Previously, two fields of Lutton Lodge Farm formed a pene-exclave with an isthmus only about two yards wide.

The township (now parish) of Auckley is in Yorkshire, but was divided between that county and Nottinghamshire in a complicated manner. The latter had three exclaves of very irregular shape, and seven satellite exclaves making a total of ten. Yorkshire had two counter- exclaves in the largest exclave. The township was united under Yorkshire in 1886.Ordnance Survey 6 inch sheet Yorkshire 285, 286 1854Nottinghamshire (green), Lincolnshire (orange) and Yorkshire (pink) meeting in confusion (Historic County Borders Project). Pene-exclave: * The parish of Broadholme was mostly surrounded by Lincolnshire, and was inaccessible directly from Nottinghamshire. It was transferred to the former county in 1989, despite much local opposition. Riparian semi-exclave: * The parish of Misson, Nottinghamshire is a riparian semi-exclave completely cut off from the rest of the county by the River Idle -there is not even footpath access allowing you to swim across.Ordnance Survey Landranger maps 111, 112 = Oxfordshire = The county had no exclaves after 1844, and four were abolished then (pre-1844 total 4, legal 4; post-1844 total 0): * Ackhampstead (1).

The greater part of the parish of Lillingstone Lovell, transferred to Buckinghamshire which already had a portion.Ordnance Survey First Edition, sheet 45 1833 = Shropshire = The county had no exclaves after 1844, and a total of eleven were abolished then (pre-1844 total 11 legal 1; post-1844 total 0). * Halesowen (11). The ancient parish of Halesowen was a large exclave, transferred to Worcestershire. it included the townships of Halesowen proper, Hunnington, Illey, Oldbury, Ridgacre, Romsley and Warley Salop. The area around the last, especially on Barnford Hill south of Langley Green had extremely complicated boundaries. Barnford Hill saw the counties of Shropshire and Worcestershire share out field strips. Worcestershire had twenty-seven counter-exclaves and the Shropshire exclave had ten counter-counter exclaves, both sets including field strips of a fraction of an acre. Four of the Worcester sub-enclaves bordered on Staffordshire. Riparian semi-exclaves: * The border with Shropshire between Llanymynech and Melverley (the Welsh- English border) runs along the River Vyrnwy, but this river meanders at will. Dropped meanders mean that there are six riparian semi-enclaves of Shropshire, and four of Montgomeryshire. Since this is a national boundary, they have been left alone.Ordnance Survey Landranger map 126. = Somerset = The county had no exclaves after 1844, and one was abolished then (pre-1844 total 1, legal 1; post-1844 total 0): * Holwell (1).

The extra-parochial territory of Dudley Castle Hill, including Dudley Castle, was anciently part of Seisdon Hundred in Staffordshre. However it abutted the town of Dudley, itself an exclave of Worcestershire (q.v.), and the castle itself was a pene-exclave of Staffordshire because the gate opened onto Worcestershire. Dudley Castle Hill became a civil parish in 1858, and was annexed to Dudley Municipal Borough and Worcestershire in 1865. In 1889 Dudley became a county borough and Dudley Castle Hill was returned to Staffordshire as the only parish in Dudley Rural District in 1894. In 1926 Dudley County Borough had its boundaries extended, making Dudley Castle Hill an exclave in Worcestershire. This lasted only until 1929, three years, when it was annexed. * Edingale (3). The village of Edingale was divided between Derbyshire and Staffordshire, with townships of the same name belonging to Croxall and Alrewas. Derbyshire had three exclaves, and Stsffordshire three. All were abolished when Edingale civil parish was created in 1936 and put in Staffordshire.VCH Staffordshire Vol. 4 p. 58 * Rolleston on Dove (1). The parish of Rolleston on Dove had an exclave comprising a single meadow on the River Dove south of Marston on Dove. This was within a riparian pene-exclave of Derbyshire (see below).Ordnance Survey 6 inch sheet Derbyshire LIII SE 1885, exclave marked \\"d\\". One exclave was abolished in 1844: * Broome and Clent (1). The parishes of Broome and Clent, together transferred to Worcestershire. Riparian semi-exclaves: * The River Dove, where it forms the boundary between Derbyshire and Staffordshire, has changed course in many places in between Rocester and its confluence with the River Trent, leaving several riparian semi-enclaves of both counties along it. These have mostly been left alone. Derbyshire has thirteen with another two connected by bridge; Staffordshire twelve, with a further three connected by bridge.Ordnance Survey Landranger map 128 = Surrey = The county had compact boundaries, and no exclaves. Riparian semi-exclave: * A dropped meander on the River Thames just north of Chertsey Bridge left part of the county on the wrong side of the river at Chertsey Lock. This was called Bos Ait and featured an oxbow lake in 1872, but has been mostly lost to a gravel pit.Ordnance Survey 6 inch sheet Surrey XI 1872 = Suffolk = The county mostly had compact boundaries, no exclaves and one large pene-exclave which survives to the present day: * Newmarket, Suffolk cannot be accessed directly from the rest of the county by any public right of way, although the isthmus was slightly widened in 1992 so that the boundary now abuts the B1506 road. The pene-exclave also contains the parish of Exning. Before the exclave was enlarged in 1894, the boundary of the town ran along the High Street and the southern part with the railway station was in the Cambridgeshire parish of Woodditton.. In 1992, as well as the pene- exclaves isthmus being widened, half of Newmarket Heath and the small village of Landwade were annexed from Cambridgeshire. = Sussex = The county had no exclaves after 1844, and one was abolished then (pre-1844 total 1, legal 1; post-1844 total 0): * Bohunt (1). An exclave of the parish of Rogate known as Bohunt west of Liphook, transferred to the parish of Bramshott in Hampshire. The county had only one pene-exclave, the boundaries being otherwise compact: * The Sussex portion of the parish of Bramshott was transferred to join the rest in 1894. It comprised a thin strip containing Griggs Green, and a sub- salient containing part of Lowsley FarmOrdnance Survey 6 inch sheet Hampshire XLIV 1872 = Warwickshire = The county had one exclave after 1844, and one was abolished then (pre-1844 total 2, legal 2; post-1844 total 1, legal 1): * Ilmington, Stretton-on-Fosse and Whitchurch (1). The parishes of Ilmington, Stretton-on-Fosse, and Whitchurch formed a large exclave of Warwickshire, separated from the main part of the county by an exclave of four Worcestershire parishes. In 1931 the intervening area of Worcestershire was transferred to Warwickshire, so that the three parishes became joined to the rest of the county. Abolished in 1844: * Tutnall and Cobley (1). The township of Tutnall and Cobley (in the parish of Tardebigge), transferred to Worcestershire. = Wiltshire = The county had no exclaves after 1844, and ten were abolished then (pre-1844 total 10, legal 6; post-1844 total 0): * Inglesham (1). The parish divided between Berkshire and Wiltshire, and was united in the latter county in 1844. The Berkshire portion contained a small exclave of Wiltshire around the parish church, which was thus eliminated. The original boundary survived for parliamentary purposes into the latter 19th century -including the exclave.Ordnance Survey 6 inch sheet Berkshire VII 1883 * Kingswood (1). The parish of Kingswood, transferred to Gloucestershire. * Minety (1). A small counter-enclave within the parish of Minety which was an exclave of Gloucestershire within the county. This contained the parish church, and was abolished when the exclave was transferred to Wiltshire.Ordnance Survey First Edition sheet 34 * Poulton (1). The parish of Poulton transferred to Gloucestershire. * Shinfield (2). The parish of Shinfield in Berkshire had two portions forming exclaves of Wiltshire. The larger contained the hamlets of Swallowfield and Riseley, the smaller that of Farley Hill.Ordnance Survey First Series sheet 12 1817Exclaves of Wiltshire (lilac) near Reading, Berkshire. (Historical County Borders Project) * Wokingham and Hurst (4). A large, irregularly shaped exclave took in part of the parochial chapelry of Hurst, Berkshire in the parish of Sonning, and part of the parish of Wokingham. It had a waist the width of a road at Broad Common. It included the east end of Wokingham town with its parish church, and the east end of the village of Twyford. A small, very irregularly shaped satellite exclave occupied the west side of the latter village, and two tiny ones were in its centre. This set of four exclaves, treated as two legal issues, were transferred to Berkshire. = Worcestershire = Dudley, shown on an 1814 map as an exclave of Worcestershire surrounded by Staffordshire. Also note the exclave of Shropshire at Halesowen, which was abolished by the Counties (Detached Parts) Act 1844 The historical county was well provided with exclaves. After 1844, six survived with three small satellite exclaves making a total of nine. Twenty-nine were abolished in 1844, although several were tiny (pre-1844 total 38, legal 8; post-1844 total 9, legal 6): * Alderminster, Shipston-on-Stour, Tidmington and Tredington (1).The parishes of Alderminster, Shipston-on-Stour, Tidmington, and Tredington formed a large exclave which wsa transferred to Warwickshire in 1931. * Blockley (1).The parish of Blockley, including Paxford and Aston Magna, was transferred to Gloucestershire in 1931. * Cutsdean (1). The chapelry of Cutsdean, in the parish of Bredon, became a civil parish in 1866. It was transferred to Gloucestershire in 1931. * Dudley (2). The town of Dudley survived as an exclave of 3548 acres (1436 ha)The House of Lords 1873 p. 38 until 1966 (augmented 1926), because it was the biggest town in the county and had a greater population than Worcester. It excluded Dudley Castle (see Staffordshire, above) but had a satellite exclave as a strip of woodland on the west side of Dudley Castle Hill.Ordnance Survey sheet Worcestershire I 1886 In 1889 the town became a county borough remaining, however, an exclave of Worcestershire for some purposes. In 1926 the exclave was extended by annexing land from the administrative county of Staffordshire for the Priory and Wrens Nest Hill council estates, and this abolished the satellite exclave. In 1966 the county borough absorbed further surrounding areas of Staffordshire, and it became the overall lieutenancy and ceremonial county of Dudley. This abolished the exclave. * Daylesford (1).The parish of Daylesford was transferred to Gloucestershire in 1931. * Edvin Loach (3). The parish of Edvin Loach of 510 acres (206.3 ha)The House of Lords 1873 p. 38 was transferred to Herefordshire in 1893. It previously had two small satellite exclaves at Cwmwood Farm, transferred to the parish of Collington in 1886. * Evenlode (1).The parish of Evenlode was transferred to Gloucestershire in 1931. Previously four counties had met at a point marked by the Four Shire Stone, but afterwards only Gloucestershire, Warwickshire and Oxfordshire did. Two larger exclaves were abolished in 1844, and twenty-seven small ones: * Alstone and Little Washbourne (1). The hamlets of Alstone and Little Washbourne together, both in the parish of Overbury, transferred to Gloucestershire. * Church Icomb (1). That half of the parish of Icomb (older spelling Iccomb) called Church Icomb, transferred to Gloucestershire to join the portion already in the county called Westward Icomb. The village had been divided. * Halesowen (27). The ancient parish of Halesowen was a large exclave of Shropshire, transferred to Worcestershire. This act abolished twenty-seven counter-exclaves within it, including three tiny field strips. Pene-exclaves: The 1931 boundary re-ordering abolished two pene-exclaves comprising individual parishes, by annexing neighbouring areas from Gloucestershire: * Church Honeybourne. * Sedgeberrow. A third was annexed by Gloucestershire: * Teddington. = Yorkshire = The county had two exclaves after 1844 (pre-1844 total 2, legal 0; post-1844 total 2, legal 0): * Auckley (2). The only exclaves that Yorkshire had were two small counter-exclaves at Auckley, within an exclave of Nottinghamshire (q.v.). One comprised Insley Plantation, the other was two fields of a farm called Hayfield. These were abolished in 1886, when the township was united in Yorkshire.Ordnance Survey 6 inch sheet Yorkshire 285, 286 1854 References Category:Counties of England established in antiquity Exclaves 1844-1974 * Category:Historic counties of Wales Category:Lists of English county boundary changes County Exclaves 1844-1974 County Exclaves 1844-1974 County Exclaves 1844-1974 Category:Local government legislation in England and Wales External links * Historic Counties Map with Exclaves on Wikimapia (this map is under open copyright.) * Historic Counties Trust * The Historic Counties Borders Project (open access database.)

(1917 ‚Äì 29 August 1987) was a British primatologist, paleoanthropologist, and physician, who is notable for his work with Homo habilis and OH 7, as well as on human and primate hands/feet. During his life he was widely considered a leading authority on primate taxonomy, but is perhaps most famous to the general public for his research on Bigfoot. Biography Napier was an orthopedic surgeon at the University of London before being invited by Sir Wilfrid Le Gros Clark to join him in his paleoanthropology research. Napier then dedicated his life afterward to primatology, becoming the founder of the Primate Society of Great Britain, and was among the group, with Louis Leakey and Philip Tobias, that named Homo habilis in the 1960s.Human evolution: Homo, Smithsonian Institution Napier later became Director of the Primate Biology Program at the Smithsonian Institution, where he examined the famous purported footage of Bigfoot, the Patterson‚ÄìGimlin film.

His investigations included interviewing amateur investigators and purported eyewitnesses, visiting alleged Bigfoot sighting areas, studying the scant physical evidence, and screening the 1967 Patterson‚ÄìGimlin film. Napier concluded the film was a clever hoax: \\"the scientific evidence taken collectively points to a hoax of some kind.\\" However, by the same token, in reference to the Patterson‚ÄìGimlin film, Napier did also state on page 89 of his 1973 book 'Bigfoot: The Yeti And Sasquatch In Myth And Reality', \\"there was nothing in this film which would prove conclusively that this was a hoax.\\" In his 1973 book on the subject, Napier ultimately judged the evidence to be inconclusive: there was not enough hard proof to confirm to Napier that Bigfoot was a real creature.Bigfoot; The Yeti and Sasquatch in Myth and Reality (New York: E P Dutton, 1973) However, Napier judged the indirect evidence - especially footprints - as compelling and intriguing enough to avoid dismissing the subject as entirely unworthy of serious study.

Zhang Guan was a distant relative of the ruling family of Former Liang. He was serving as the governor of He Province (Ê≤≥Â∑û, modern southwestern Gansu and eastern Qinghai) under Zhang Xuanjing's uncle Zhang Zuo, who had seized the throne from Zhang Xuanjing's older brother Zhang Yaoling in 354. Zhang Zuo, whose reign was marked by violence and extravagance, was fearful of Zhang Guan's military power, so he sent his subordinate Suo Fu (Á¥¢Â≠ö) to replace Zhang Guan while ordering Zhang Guan to attack Xiongnu tribes which had rebelled. He then set up an ambush against Zhang Guan, ready to seize him and/or kill him. However, news leaked, and Zhang Guan executed Suo and then proceeded against the capital, announcing that he was going to store Zhang Yaoling. He won victories over Zhang Zuo's forces and approached the capital Guzang (ÂßëËáß, in modern Wuwei, Gansu). He was joined in his cause by the general Song Hun, who also marched on Guzang. In response, Zhang Zuo executed Zhang Yaoling by beating him to death. That move, however, did not save Zhang Zuo. As Song arrived at the capital, Zhang Zuo ordered that Zhang Guan's brother Zhang Ju (ÂºµÁêö) and son Zhang Song (ÂºµÂµ©) be arrested and killed, but Zhang Ju and Zhang Song instead started an uprising within Guzang and opened the city gates to allow Song Hun's forces to enter. Zhang Zuo's own forces turned on him and killed him. Song Hun and Zhang Ju then declared the six-year-old Zhang Xuanjing the Duke of Xiping‚Äîa hereditary Jin Dynasty (265-420)-created title that his family had held for generations. Upon Zhang Guan's subsequent arrival at Guzang, he became the regent, and he instead had Zhang Xuanjing claim the title of Prince of Liang, a title that Jin did not confer, but continued to claim to be a Jin vassal. He had himself made the governor of Liang Province (Ê∂ºÂ∑û, modern central and western Gansu) and the Duke of Zhangyi. In early 356, in response to diplomatic and implicit military pressure that Former Qin put on the state, Zhang Guan submitted Former Liang to formal Former Qin authority. Once Zhang Guan became regent he became dictatorial and suspicious, making awards and punishments based on his own personal whim. He became apprehensive of Song Hun, and considered killing Song Hun and his brother Song Cheng (ÂÆãÊæÑ), and further considered deposing Zhang Xuanjing and making himself prince. Once Song Hun heard this news, he gathered his troops and declared Zhang Guan to be treasonous, claiming to have authorization from Zhang Xuanjing's grandmother Princess Dowager Ma to kill him. A battle soon developed within Guzang, but Song prevailed, and Zhang Guan and his brother Zhang Ju both committed suicide, and their clan was slaughtered. Song Hun became the regent.

Bossburg had a maximum population of 800 in 1892. The town was once named \\"Young America,\\" although in 1896 it was renamed in honor of the town's first citizen, C. S. Boss. It is currently best known for the 1969 discovery of the footprints in the snow of a supposed Sasquatch known as \\"Cripplefoot,\\" and subsequent hi-jinks. 200px The town produced lead and silver from established mines; however, when mining operations eventually slowed financial issues arose. In a futile effort to keep the town alive, a ferry system across the Columbia River was established, and a sawmill was built for lumber operations. Several Bossburg newspapers were published, notably the Bossburg Journal from 1893 to 1910, and the Bossburg Herald which was founded and published in 1910 for only one year. The Bossburg cemetery is still in use and is cared for by local families; nevertheless, records are not routinely kept and as a result there are several unmarked graves. Bossburg Cripplefoot Tracks On November 24, 1969, large human-like tracks with a crippled-looking right foot were found near the Bossburg town dump. (Earlier that year a woman had reported seeing a Sasquatch in a nearby location to the police.) The track maker was believed by some to be an injured Bigfoot and was dubbed by locals as the \\"Bossburg Cripple\\"; it is now generally known as \\"Cripplefoot.\\" On November 27 Bigfoot searcher Ren√© Dahinden arrived to investigate, but by then the tracks had mostly been trampled by sightseers. Dahinden photographed and cast the best print he could find. He was joined for three days by another searcher, Bob Titmus, who returned about a month later.Hunter and Dahinden, 146‚Äì147, 151 After looking for two weeks for new evidence, Sasquatch-searchersMarx, Titmus, and Dahinden had been members of Tom Slick's Bigfoot-searching Pacific Northwest Expedition.

On December 13, 1969 they discovered 1089 giant human-like tracks in the snow leading to, from, and across a river near Lake Roosevelt, near Bossburg.Hunter and Dahinden, 148 They were joined later by anthropologist Grover Krantz, who took photos and made casts, and later, intermittently, by Patterson film-maker Roger Patterson and his assistant, Dennis Jenson, who stayed full-time.Hunter and Dahinden, 152‚Äì53 Casts and/or photos of the tracks were later studied by primatologist John Napier and anthropologist Jeff Meldrum. Those scientists became convinced of the tracks' authenticity. Ren√© Dahinden was also impressed by the tracks,Hunter and Dahinden, 149‚Äì50 but was suspicious of certain circumstances.Hunter and Dahinden, 148, 150, 152‚Äì53 One circumstance was that before he and a passenger had seen the tracks, driver Marx pulled over, got out, and walked off, returning shortly thereafter and explaining that they had to leave immediately to retrieve his camera equipment, since he had just found tracks. This was just after they had passed an empty Jeep parked beside the road, whose inhabitants, Ren√© considered, might have been in the process of returning from their track-making. The Jeep was gone when they returned. But, ultimately, he accepted the tracks as authentic.Wylie, 160 Bossburg captured-Sasquatch hoax In January 1970, while Bigfooters were in Bossburg in the wake of Ivan Marx's Cripplefoot track find there,Regal, 88 they were approached by Joe Metlow, a prospector. He told them that he had a Bigfoot immobilized in an abandoned mine shaft and that he had sold it. The Bigfooters said that they \\"would top your best offer,\\" and a bidding war ensued. John Green, a Canadian Sasquatch researcher, and a journalist and editor in his day job, came and got involved in a way that offended Dahinden.Hunter and Dahinden, 157 Metlow declined to give anyone a peek for $1000. Bids topped out at $55,000, which called his bluff, and interest fizzled when he wouldn't bite. Bossburg Sasquatch-foot-in-a-freezer hoax Joe Metlow then claimed that he had a Sasquatch foot in his freezer, which started another bidding war. Again, he was evasive, changed his story, and ducked out of a trip to have potential buyers view it. At this point \\"it was obvious to the Sasquatch squads that they'd been had.\\"Hunter and Dahinden, 153‚Äì59 Bossburg filmed- Sasquatch hoax Nine months later, Ivan Marx phoned Ren√© Dahinden in October 1970 and said, \\"I've got a film of the cripple[foot Bigfoot].\\" Bigfooters flocked back to Bossburg. After viewing his film, nearly all were convinced of its authenticity and a bidding war for rights ensued. However, Bigfooter Peter Byrne paid attention to a couple of children who had been saying that they knew where the film had been shot. When he arrived there, he discovered that the features of the site were inconsistent with what Marx had claimed about the circumstances of the filming and the height of the subject.

He initially studied mathematics and philosophy in Munich and a PhD in 1880 with an already award-winning work. Lepsius was one of the founders and the first chairman of the German‚ÄìArmenian Society. During World War I he published his work \\"Bericht √ºber die Lage des armenischen Volkes in der T√ºrkei\\" (\\"Report on the situation of the Armenian People in Turkey\\") in which he meticulously documented and condemned the Armenian Genocide. A second edition entitled \\"Der Todesgang des armenischen Volkes\\" (\\"The way to death of the Armenian people\\") included an interview with Enver Pasha, one of the chief architects of the genocide. Lepsius had to publish the report secretly because Turkey was an ally of the German Empire and the official military censorship soon forbade the publication because it feared that it would affront the strategically important Turkish ally. However Lepsius managed to distribute more than 20,000 copies of the report. In his novel The Forty Days of Musa Dagh (\\"Die vierzig Tage des Musa Dagh\\") the Austrian-Jewish author Franz Werfel portrayed Lepsius as a \\"guardian angel of the Armenians\\". Today, the intellectual heritage of Johannes Lepsius was collected by the German church historian Hermann Goltz, who installed the \\"Johannes Lepsius Archive\\" in Halle upon Saale with Martin Luther University of Halle-Wittenberg. Several documents and journals from the archive were published as microfiche. Family Johannes Lepsius Johannes Lepsius was the youngest son of the founder of Egyptology in Germany, the Egyptologist Carl Richard Lepsius and his wife Elisabeth Klein (1828‚Äì1899), a great- granddaughter of Friedrich Nicolai. Johannes' parents grew up in a house with a great intellectual horizon. In this house, Johannes met many important personalities of the empire, from politics to culture to religion. There were six siblings, including the geologist and Rector of the Technische Universit√§t Darmstadt Richard Lepsius (1851‚Äì1915), the chemist and director of the Chemical Factory Griesheim Bernhard Lepsius (1854‚Äì1934) and the portrait painter and member of the Prussian Academy of Arts (as of 1916) Reinhold Lepsius (1857‚Äì1929). His grandfather was the Naumburg County Commissioner Peter Carl Lepsius (1775‚Äì1853), his great-grandfather Johann August Lepsius (1745‚Äì1801) was Mayor of Naumburg upon Saale. His wife was Margaret (Maggie) Zeller. She came from the internationally known missionary family, the W√ºrttembergian Zellers. Her father was Reverend Johannes Zeller (1830‚Äì1902), leader of the Gobat School (est. in 1847) in Jerusalem, directed by the Church Missionary Society since 1877.Cf. Liesel Reichle-Zeller (1987) Johannes Zeller 1830‚Äì1902, Missionar in Pal√§stina, Stuttgart: Liesel Reichle-Zeller (= Sonderver√∂ffentlichung des Martinzeller Verbandes; No. 7). Through her mother Maggie Zeller was a granddaughter of Jerusalem's Bishop Samuel Gobat and a niece of Dora Rappard. Maggie and Lepsius met in Ottoman Jerusalem. Johannes, who was on the board of the Syrian Orphanage from 1884 to 1886, met many problems in Jerusalem due to massacres inflicted on the Christian population in 1860. Johannes Lepsius house museum - Lepsiushaus was opened in 2011, Potsdam, Germany, in the house where Lepsius lived from 1908 to 1926. it's also \\"Research Center for Genocide Studies\\". The Armenian Genocide Johannes Lepsius on a 2013 Armenian stamp In 1914, Lepsius, Paul Rohrbach and Avetik Isahakyan created the German‚ÄìArmenian Society, with Lepsius becoming the first chairman. Lepsius is known for his documentation of the Armenian Genocide. His work, \\"Report on the situation of the Armenian people in Turkey\\", was censored on 7 August 1916, however 20,000 copies were sent throughout Germany before the censorship was enforced. Another edition of the documentation is an interview with Enver Pasha in 1915 that bears the title \\"The death corridor of the Armenian people\\". In 1909 the Armenians of the Ottoman Empire had high expectations from the Young Turk movement which brought Abdul Hamid's regime to an end. Yet during the opening months of the First World War, there were mass arrests, deportations, and massacres of Armenians living in Eastern Anatolia. During this time, Lepsius founded humanitarian relief activities, and tried (unsuccessfully) to influence Germany, the Ottoman Empire's ally, which had thousands of soldiers and officers stationed throughout the Ottoman Empire. According to Ernst Jaeckh \\"At the time of World War I he introduced the Armenian protagonist. Dr. Lepsius, to the Turkish Generalissimo Enver Pasha, and through the author's [Jaeckh's] intervention the lives of many Armenians, particularly women and children, were saved.\\"Ernest Jackh (Ernst Jaeckh) (1944) The Rising Crescent, New York-Toronto: Farrar & Rinehart, p. 44. One of Lepsius' most important works is, Germany and Armenia 1914‚Äì1918: Collection of Diplomatic documents, which later became considered as \\"the main document on the Armenian Genocide.\\" Later, in The Forty Days of Musa Dagh, Franz Werfel attributes two chapters to the description of Lepsius' struggle and his negotiations with Enver Pasha.

It had transmitted a digital signal over channel 6 with a virtual channel of 1.1. Programming consisted of Silent Films starring Charlie Chaplin and Buster Keaton. The station aired this programming without commercials. Viewers could hear the audio of WWRU in Jersey City, which is likewise intended for the radio audience listening on 87.7FM. During most of its life while operating on channel 6, the station has been operated more as a radio station than a television station. WNYZ-LP broadcasts video, usually silent movies which are repeated throughout the day, for the likely reason to fulfill the Federal Communications Commission (FCC) requirement that some sort of video be broadcast on the frequency because WNYZ-LP is licensed as a television facility. History =As W33BS= The station's history originated in 1987. However, it first signed on in 1998 as W33BS in Darien, Connecticut, then on UHF channel 33. The station was subsequently moved to VHF channel 6 in 2003. Rev. Dr. Carrie L. Thomas, the original owner, sold the station to Island Broadcasting Company after its transition to channel 6. After the transition, it was re-licensed to New York City, and dropped its religious format. It had, since moving to channel 6, effectively operated as an FM radio station. As is true in most other major U.S. cities, the New York City FM radio dial is significantly crowded. As such, the market had not added a station to the FM band since 1985, effectively necessitating the rather unconventional extension of the FM band. =As WNYZ-LP= The call sign changed to WNYZ-LP in 2003 and moved to its current channel 6 making it the seventh station to be added to VHF dial next to WBQM-LP. The audio programming on WNYZ was originally Russian Top 40 (Radio Vsyo - Russian for \\"Radio Everything\\"). Late in 2007, it was announced that the station would be changing the audio format to a Dance-intensive Rhythmic Top 40 format as \\"Pulse 87\\". After several delays, the station flipped to the new format on February 11, 2008 at Midnight. =Brief digital operation= In November 2008, Island Broadcasting installed an Axcera DT325B digital VHF transmitter with the Axciter/Bandwidth Enhancement Technology (BET) option, which permitted WNYZ-LP to simultaneously transmit a single 480i SD digital stream using virtual channel 1.1, along with the analog audio carrier on 87.75 MHz. This allowed the station to serve both its radio and television audiences. At first, WNYZ broadcast color bars, a legal ID, and a message telling viewers to listen to 87.7 FM. Then in 2009, the station broadcast The Jared Whitham Channel featuring Jared Whitham, a bespectacled local area comic/musician. The station operated in this hybrid analog/digital mode for just over one year. =Pulse 87= From 2008 to October 30, 2009, WNYZ-LP operated as the dance music format Pulse 87. Joel Salkowitz, the station's program director and a former employee of WQHT during their early days told the online website All Access about Pulse 87's musical direction: \\"The station is a Top 40/Rhythmic, leaning away from Rock and Rap and more towards Club and Dance sounds in their place. Familiar, rhythmic hits mixed with the very best new music. This is a current/recurrent-based radio station.\\" The station's format, which features more cutting-edge dance music, is unique in New York City as WKTU currently plays a more classic Rhythmic Adult Contemporary dance format. The format is also rarely seen in the US as only a handful of stations carry this format in America.\\" Its transmitter is on top of the Citicorp Building in Long Island City, Queens, and Pulse 87.7 IDs alluded to it as \\"that big blue building in Queens\\". The station's audio signal reached the five boroughs, Nassau and Western Suffolk, Westchester, Rockland and Northeastern New Jersey. Before June 12, 2009, the signal of ABC-owned WPVI-TV (channel 6) in Philadelphia made WNYZ-LP unavailable in most of central and parts of Northern New Jersey; NBC affiliate WRGB (also on channel 6) in Albany also had similar effects in parts of the Hudson Valley in New York. After the transition to digital TV on June 12, 2009, reception of WNYZ improved in Central New Jersey and the Hudson Valley. However, it continued to impact reception of WPVI and WRGB's digital signals in these areas because they stayed on the channel 6 frequency. On March 10, 2008, the station made a deal with Arbitron that would allow the station to be rated in its PPMs, but because it is a television station, WNYZ could not be rated in the official Arbitron radio books for the New York Metropolitan market. On March 31, 2009, it was announced that, according to a Mega Media press release, \\"due to the recent policy change at Arbitron, effective April 1, 2009, Pulse 87 will now be included and measured under the standard PPM Radio Ratings report effective April 2009 survey period.\\" Pulse 87 was later added to the Rhythmic and Dance panels at Mediabase, while Billboard/Nielsen BDS had the station monitored as a reporter on the Dance/Mix Show Airplay panel. Pulse 87 has since been relaunched as an Internet station at http://www.pulse87ny.com/ ;the station is operated by Salkowitz, who purchased the Pulse 87 automation equipment and the intellectual property in a bankruptcy auction. =Financial troubles and bankruptcy= Mega Media had been in serious financial trouble long before it launched Pulse 87. This came to a head on August 12, 2009 when Mega Media filed for bankruptcy, reporting $3.5 million in liabilities against assets of just $180,000. Mega says it hopes to continue operating Pulse while it restructures under Chapter 11. On October 30, 2009, the current lease between Mega Media Group and Island Broadcasting ended because Island Broadcasting did not receive the $500,000 it was owed according to the Stipulation and Order regarding the Time Brokerage Agreement. Island Broadcasting was under no obligation to continue allowing Pulse 87 to use their signal without payment for the lease. However, there was a tentative deal in place for a new company to buy out Mega Media and pay off the debt owed to Island Broadcasting. The new company planned to continue the dance format but nothing ever came to fruition. The WNYZ-LP license was offered for sale by Island Broadcasting for $15 million. Pulse 87 went off the air on October 30, 2009 at 5:00 PM. =Party 105 era= A new format for WNYZ was announced on November 2, 2009, at 6 am. JVC Broadcasting's WPTY \\"Party 105\\" took over the 87.7 frequency. The same programming airing on WPTY, Party 105, in Suffolk County was heard on 87.7, but the music was not the same that the Pulse 87 audience had grown accustomed to. It was a hip-hop based format, with some dance music, but mostly nostalgic 1980s and 1990s rhythmic hits and current R&B; and hip-hop. The studios and programming originated on Long Island, while WNYZ served as a simulcast to WPTY. Pulse 87's audience, which had grown to over 1 million listeners per week before they went off the air, eventually stopped tuning into this new format, and the inability of many potential listeners in the New York area to tune into the 87.7 signal made the simulcast unprofitable for JVC Broadcasting. On January 21, 2010, WPTY stopped simulcasting on WNYZ-LP. Island Broadcasting let the signal go silent for one day and then began playing dance music for two hours the next morning. Due to a non-compete agreement, Island Broadcasting was not allowed to broadcast the dance music. Later in the day, a filler format of Jazz and Blues standards with station identification aired until January 27, 2010. =Indie Darkroom and Russian Radio= The following day, the station later implemented an independent music format on its audio channel known as the Indie Darkroom. On March 21, 2010, the station announced that Indie Darkroom would soon be relegated to the overnight hours on weekends. During other hours of Saturdays and Sundays, the station becomes CaribStar 87.7FM (Sat/Sun 6am-midnight). Although a number of stations offer brokered programming for New York's estimated 1.5 million English/French Caribbean nationals (including a number of pirate stations in Bronx and Brooklyn), CaribStar represents the most significant effort to develop programing for this consumer market. On March 31, 2010, the station added Russian language programming (\\"Danu Radio\\", a successor of \\"Radio Vsyo\\"). \\"Danu Radio\\" airs on weekdays 5am-8pm, and Fridays until 3am. On May 2, 2010, the station began airing Hindi-language programming on Sunday mornings. On July 25, 2010, the station began airing Korean programing simulcasted from WWRU in Jersey City. Accidental license cancellation On June 29, 2011, the FCC canceled the license of WNYZ-LP and deleted its call sign; the station had filed an extension for its Construction Permit (CP) for its digital facilities, after the original CP had expired. According to FCC regulations, a CP extension could only be filed only if the current CP is still valid. According to Scott Fybush, the cancellation was eventually undone due to the cancellation being a mistake on the FCC's part; the FCC meant to only deny the digital CP extension, not revoke the analog one as they had mistakenly done. The station's license was renewed in 2015 for an 8-year term.

A form today is koshti pahlavani practiced in the zurkaneh, \\"home of strength,\\" while regional variations differ from one province to another. Olympic freestyle wrestling is often referred to as the \\"first sport\\" of Iran. Iran has won 43 Olympic medals for wrestling.  History  Wrestling in Iran, like weightlifting, can be traced to the ancient Persian sport of Varzesh-e-Bastani, which translates to \\"ancient sport.\\" Traditionally the sport was seen as a way to promote \\"inner strength through outer strength.\\" Those involved were meant to embody kindness and humility, while defending the society from \\"sinfulness.\\" This practice has survived into the modern era through various attempts to downplay the pre-Islamic roots of the country. It made the transition from the Pahlavi shah's efforts to secularize and westernize the country and through the transition of the 1979 Revolution.  Interactions with the U.S.  After his election in 1997, President Mohammad Khatami saw the connection that the U.S. and Iran had with wrestling as a possible way to reopen diplomatic relations after nearly two decades. This was an Iranian take on Nixon-era \\"ping pong\\" diplomacy with China. In Feb. 2017 Iran planned on denying visas to U.S. wrestlers for the Freestyle World Cup. This was done in response to President Trump's travel ban to seven Muslim majority countries. The decision to bar U.S. participants was eventually overturned by Iranian officials after a U.S. federal judge temporarily blocked Trump's ban on Iranians traveling to the U.S.  Professional Wrestling  One professional wrestling promotion that operates in Iran is the Iran Wrestling Group (IWG).

Early life and education A native of Huntington, Indiana, Anson graduated from high school there and worked briefly as a sports reporter for the Huntington Herald-Press. He then served in the U.S. Army in the European Theater, fighting in the Battle of the Bulge and became the Army's youngest master sergeant following his actions in the battle. He graduated from Colgate University in 1948 where he was a member of Phi Kappa Tau fraternity. Career He spent his entire career in the service of the North American college fraternity movement. He served his own fraternity, Phi Kappa Tau in a number of positions culminating with his appointment as executive director. In 1970, Anson became executive director of the North American Interfraternity Conference, a position he held until his retirement in 1982. His most significant achievement was his leadership in the effort to gain an exemption from Title IX to retain the single-sex character of American college fraternities and sororities. When Title IX was first passed, it looked as though student organizations such as fraternities and sororities would have to become co-educational. With the help of Senator Birch Bayh, a fraternity man and other friendly members of Congress, an exemption was gained that has not been in significant jeopardy of repeal since that time. He was the author of The Golden Jubilee History of Phi Kappa Tau in 1957, A Diamond Jubilee History of the National Interfraternity Conference: 75 Glorious Years in 1984 and at the time of his death he was serving as editor of the current edition of Baird's Manual of American College Fraternities. Legacy and honors In 1985, Anson won the Interfraternity world's highest honor, the Gold Medal of the North American Interfraternity Conference. In addition, he was widely honored by men's and women's Greek-letter organizations for his contributions to the North American college fraternity movement including awards from Lambda Chi Alpha, Delta Gamma and others. In Anson's memory, the Association of Fraternity Advisors presents a Jack L. Anson Award and the National Interfraternal Foundation presents Jack L. Anson Fellowships.

Beginning to work together in London in the 1970s, they wrote and published The Western Way in 1985. This followed the lead of Christine Hartley's The Western Mysteries Tradition (1968) by identifying and promoting a European mystical tradition to offset the then-current domination of Eastern mysticisms from India and China.Hutton 2003, pages 245‚Äì46. The book included meditations to enable readers to make contact with their inner worlds. Historian Ronald Hutton considers this an influential work.Hutton 2003, page 246. They also edited The Encyclopedia of Celtic Wisdom (2000), devised the Storyworld series (2009ff) and, most recently, created The Steampunk Tarot: Gods of the Machine (2012). They studied with two of the leading esotericists of the time, Gareth Knight and Dolorous Ashcroft-Nowicki, and from 1988 to 1992 they served as joint- presiders of the Order of Bards, Ovates and Druids. Since 1989 they have run the Fellowship of Isis Lyceum, Domus Sophiae Terrae et Sancte Gradalis in Oxford, and are both members of the Archpriesthood Union as custodians of the legacy of the Fellowship of Isis. They are active on the New Age workshop circuit, teaching their versions of the Celtic mysteries, Neo-shamanism, the Goddess and King Arthur.Hutton 2003, page 246.

John Matthews  John Matthews John Matthews (born 1948) has been involved in study of the mysteries of Britain including the Arthurian Legends and the Grail Myth, for almost fifty years. He has published over ninety books on myth, the Arthurian Legends and Grail studies, including The Grail: Quest for the Eternal (1981), and most recently The Camelot Oracle (2012, with Will Worthington). He has also published short stories, a volume of poetry, and several children's books, most notably Pirates (2006) which was on the New York Times best-seller list for twenty-two weeks. His book Arthur of Albion (2009) won multiple awards, including a Gold Medal from NAPPA, a gold Moonbeams award and a BIB Golden Apple Award. He has taught throughout Europe and the United StatesCarr-Gomm and Heygate 2009, page 150. and has acted as advisor for a number of media projects including the Jerry Bruckheimer film \\"King Arthur\\" (2004). He has appeared on the History Channel and Discovery Channel programmes on Arthur and the Holy Grail, and shared a BAFTA award for his work on the educational DVD made to accompany \\"King Arthur\\". He has served as a guest editor for the international journal Arthuriana, on whose editorial board he also sits.

Following the publication of The Western Way she has written over sixty books including several works on the divine feminine, and the worlds of early Welsh and Irish literature.Hutton 2003, page 143.

For several years he left the post of editor vacant while several young editors competed for it. The two most serious contenders were Harold Hayes and Clay Felker. Hayes won, and Felker went on to found New York magazine. During the Hayes-Gingrich era, Esquire played a leading role in launching the New Journalism, publishing writers like Tom Wolfe and fellow fraternity brother, Gay Talese.Polsgrove, It Wasn't Pretty, Folks, But Didn't We Have Fun? Biography Gingrich was born in Grand Rapids, Michigan, of Mennonite parents in 1903. He attended the University of Michigan where he was a member of Phi Sigma Kappa fraternity, and was noted as a member of the class of 1925. Gingrich brought numerous skills and interests to bear in the formation of Esquire magazine, notably his skill in editing, identification of talent and in publishing. His partner, David Smart led the business side of the magazine with Henry Jackson responsible for the fashion section, making up a more substantial portion of the magazine in its first fifteen years. Over his four decade career, Gingrich published such authors as Ernest Hemingway, William Faulkner, John Steinbeck, John Dos Passos, Garry Wills, Truman Capote, and Norman Mailer. He was also one of the few magazine editors to publish F. Scott Fitzgerald regularly in the late 1930s, including Fitzgerald's The Pat Hobby Stories. Gingrich also published stories by Jack Woodford, whom he befriended when they worked together at an advertising agency in the late 1920s. He wrote the introduction to Woodford's famous book on writing and publishing, Trial and Error. Esquire's origin and influence The magazine's name Esquire was inspired by a letter from Gingrich's friend Robert Klark Graham, facetiously addressing him as \\"Arnold Gingrich, Esquire.\\"Graham, Robert Klark. R.K.G. Scott-Townsend, 1996. p. 19. . The magazine he created set the template for future men's magazines of the mid-century period; for example, Playboy, a variation, essentially Esquire with nude photographs (Esquire had famously published a series of \\"Varga Girl\\" paintings and other \\"cheesecake\\" imagery since its founding). Similar periodicals include GQ (originally Gentlemen's Quarterly), Field & Stream, Popular Mechanics and Popular Science. Further afield, even The Atlantic and other regional and national publications exhibit styling and content first evidenced in the pages of Esquire. Indeed, Esquire was one of the forerunners of this genre, blending aspects of traditional, if upper-crust masculine pastimes such as armchair discussions of Ivy League pedigree, East Coast fraternalism, and literary interest with \\"the sporting life,\\" such as horses and angling, fashion, love of tobacco and whiskey, and admiration for the feminine. More recently Maxim has continued this tradition with a more edgy appeal to Gen-Xers and millennials. Later life His autobiography, Toys Of A Lifetime, with illustrations by Leslie Saalburg, was published by Alfred A. Knopf in 1966. It has long been out of print. In it, Gingrich recounts his experience with cars (he owned several notable Bentleys), including a classic R-series and S-series \\"Countryman\\" (obtained through the late J.S. Inskip in Manhattan), as well as an early Volkswagen. Other interests include transatlantic liners (notably the Normandie), French hotels, Dunhill pipes and Balkan Sobranie tobacco, clothes and all manner of other possessions and accommodations. Gingrich was an accomplished fly fisherman, writing several books on the subject and lifestyle of the gentleman angler. Gingrich was also an accomplished violinist. He would arrive at his office hours early in order to practice before the staff arrived, participated in amateur chamber music ensembles, and owned a number of highly prized instruments.S.Applebaum, \\"The Way They Play, Vol. 3\\", Paganninian Pubs. 1975 He published a musical memoir titled \\"A Thousand Mornings of Music: The Journal of an Obsession with the Violin.\\"https://www.amazon.com/Thousand- Mornings-Music-Journal-Obsession/dp/B0006C0B24 He died in 1976 at his home in Ridgewood, New Jersey.Carmody, Deirdre. \\"Arnold Gingrich, 72, Dead; Was a Founder of Esquire\\", The New York Times, July 10, 1976.

Islamic poetry has been written in many languages. History and origins Beginning with the migration of Muhammad and his followers from Mecca to Medina (A.D. 622), also known as the Hijrah, the qasida or ode was a sharp contrast to the sacred Quran. Writers at the time of pre-Islamic poetry were considered to be lacking the knowledge and authority necessary to be writing such poetry, thus leading this period of time to be called the ‚ÄúAge of Ignorance‚Äù. This time period caused tension amongst the early Islamic world, since the ode style of writing was seen as profane to the sacred text of the Quran. Islamic poetry is very important and it is heritage passed generation to generation. These poems and features examine Muslim faith and Islamic culture and address important events, holidays, and occasions such as Ramadan. These poets explore a range of spiritual, literary, and political concerns from the 6th century to the present day. Also, Islamic poetry is found centuries ago. Islamic poetry is different in many ways like cultural, Traditions, Literature, etc. Hashem stated, \\"Islamic religious poetry has been composed in a wide variety of languages\\". (Deen) poetry is a very important thing in the Islamic religion because poetry has equality of beauty to the Islamic religion. Also, poetry use in many different languages around the world. Most importantly, poetry, which had once been shunned for representing the ideals of paganism, was brought into the service of Islam. Islamic art has always retained its intrinsic quality and unique identity. Just as the religion of Islam embodies a way of life and serves as a cohesive force among ethnically and culturally diverse peoples, the art produced by and for Muslim societies has basic identifying and unifying characteristics. Hashem stated, \\"Islamic art is a modern concept created by art historians in the 19th century to facilitate categorization and study of the material first produced under the Islamic peoples that emerged from Arabia in the seventh century\\" ( Deen).Hashem, Deena. ‚ÄúPoems of Muslim Faith and Islamic Culture.‚Äù Poetry Foundation, Poetry Foundation, 2018, www.poetryfoundation.org/collections/144559/poems-of-muslim- faith-and-islamic-culture Islamic poetry in different languages * In Arabic poetry, the qasida (ode) is considered by scholars to be one of its most distinguishing aspects. originating around 500 bc, it is also considered to be fundamental to the development of pre-Islamic poetry. It is composed in monorhyme having between fifteen and eighty lines. The qasida contains three subtopics or recurring themes; the nasib or the story of a destroyed relationship and home, the fakhr which portrays self-praise for a tribe or oneself, and the rahil which is a journey into the desert involving camels. The qasida also involves biographical anecdotes called akhbar, which shows stories of revenge-taking and blood-sacrifice necessary to go through a rite of passage. The major components of the akhbar are the recurring themes of blood-revenge, initiated by the death of a father or loved one, and the \\"arrested development\\" of a person during their youth. :Example of a nasib poem by Labid ibn Rabiah: > Effaced are the abodes, brief encampments and long-settled ones; At Mina the > wilderness has claimed Mount Ghawl and Mount Rijam. The torrent channels of > Mount Rayyan, Their teachings are laid bare, Preserved as surely as > inscriptions are preserved in rock, Dung-darkened patches over which, since > they were peopled, years elapsed, Their profane mouths and sacred ones have > passed away. They were watered by the rain the spring stars bring, And on > them fell the rain of thunderclouds, downpour and drizzle... :The common theme of pre-Islamic Arabic poetry is the description of Bedouin life, the stories of rites of passage and sacrifice, depicted through imagery and the use of metaphors. This was mostly oral in composition until the third century. * Bengali poetry, originating in the 15th century, depicts the themes of internal conflict with the nafs, Islamic cosmology, historical battles, love and existential ideas concerning one‚Äôs relationship with society. This search for meaning that is present in most Bengali poems leads to the frustration depicted by poets through their dark and melancholy tones. Frustration is not pessimism, which according to scholars, some readers can misinterpret from the negative tones throughout Bengali poetry. The recurring theme of ideological values rather than societal ones is also present. The historical works of Shah Muhammad Sagir, Alaol, Abdul Hakim, Syed Sultan and Daulat Qazi mixed Bengali folk poetry with Perso-Arabian stories and themes, and are considered an important part of the Muslim culture of Bengal. Modern Bengali poetry is considered to be not rhetorical and romantic in composition. * Persian poetry originates in the modern-day countries of Afghanistan, Bangladesh, Iran, Tajikistan, and Pakistan, along with some areas in India during the tenth century. Genres present in classical Persian poetry vary and are determined by rhyme, which consists of a vowel followed by a single- rhyming letter. The most common form of Persian poetry comes in the ghazal, a love-themed short poem made of seven to twelve verses and composed in the monorhyme scheme. :The qasida is another genre of Persian poetry that depicts the themes of spiritual or worldly praise, satire, or the description of a patron. In regard to Islamic poetry, the most common form of a qasida is in the form of praise of Muhammad, along with people related to him. These religious qasidas emphasize the power and beauty of Allah from different points of views. Qasidas end in a series of anaphoras. :The use of visual poetry throughout Persian history helps readers visually understand the emotions portrayed by the poets through arranging letters and phrases in various shapes related to the message or central theme of the poem. * In Punjabi poetry, the central theme is the internal conflict caused by worldly problems, along with existential ideas presented by the poet. Another theme present throughout Punjabi poetry is the paradoxical idea of life and how although wealth and knowledge is presented to a person, it is that wealth and knowledge that can distance them from the real meaning and truth of life. :Punjabi poetry is written in a Perso-Urdu style with some Arabic and Persian vocabulary. The topics of Punjabi poetry range from romances to satires, because they are mostly written by villagers and those influenced by the village lifestyle. * Turkish poetry * Urdu poetry * In English, Islamic poetry now tends to be free-form (unrhymed). Current Muslim poets in English include Rafey Habib, Joel Hayward, Dawud Wharnsby, and the late Daniel Moore.

Also known as \\"The Gunrunners\\", the squadron is based at Marine Corps Air Station New River, North Carolina and falls under the command of Marine Aircraft Group 29 (MAG-29) and the 2nd Marine Aircraft Wing (2nd MAW). Mission The mission of HMLA-269 is to support the Marine Air-Ground Task Force commander by providing offensive air support, utility support, armed escort, and airborne supporting arms coordination; day or night; under all weather conditions; during expeditionary, joint, or combined operations. History =Early years= HMA-269 was formed at Marine Corps Air Station New River, North Carolina on February 22, 1971 and activated on July 1, 1971 as the Marine Corps first designated attack helicopter squadron. Equipped with the AH-1J \\"Sea Cobra,\\" HMA-269's mission was to provide close-in fire support during aerial and ground escort operations during ship to shore movement and subsequent operations ashore. In December 1977, HMA-269 took delivery of the first AH-1T (TOW) Cobra. The squadron opened a new era of attack helicopter aviation in early 1979 by being the first Marine Corps squadron to fire the TOW anti-tank missile from an airborne platform. In the early 1980s, with the addition of the UH-1N to the squadron, HMA-269 became HMLA-269 and expanded its primary mission to include utility helicopter support. Though heavily committed, HMLA-269 maintained its impressive list of firsts; first flight- test of biochemical protective suits in the AH-1T (TOW), first flight test of \\"fast rope insertion\\" equipment, first to refine the TOW missile engagement gun and missile radars. Additionally, the squadron participated in the first actual movement of 2nd Marine Aircraft Wing assets in an air contingency drill. In 1986, The Gunrunners achieved yet another first when they fired a Sidewinder air-to-air missile at a target drone over the Island of Vieques, Commonwealth of Puerto Rico. These achievements earned the squadron a Meritorious Unit Commendation and selection as the Marine Corps Helicopter Squadron of the Year for 1986. It was common practice during this period to split the squadron into detachments. At one time during 1988 while commanded by LtCol. Christopher B. Stoops, the squadron deployed for the Persian Gulf while simultaneously operating three other detachments in NC and the Caribbean Sea. =The Gulf War & the 1990s= In 1990, the Gunrunners deployed to Southwest Asia with twelve AH-1Ws, three AH-1Ts, and six UH-1Ns. These assets participated in a major 4th Marine Expeditionary Brigade exercises during Operation Desert Shield. During Operation Desert Storm, the squadron conducted critical on-call close-in fire support, escort for minesweeping aircraft, Surface Combat Air Patrol, and air intercept operations. Meanwhile, Gunrunner Hueys played a vital role in the raid on Faylaka Island, firing in excess of seventy-five 2.75\\" rockets at fortified Iraqi positions under NVG low light level conditions. Following the Gulf War, the Gunrunners continued to support requirements of LF6F deployments, in such areas as Yugoslavia, Somalia, and the Middle East. The squadron also supported numerous 2nd Marine Aircraft Wing and Marine Forces Atlantic exercises, both in the continental United States (CONUS) and abroad, including exercises in Norway and Puerto Rico. In 1994 the Gunrunners were tasked with providing a detachment on short notice to HMM-264 for Special Purpose MAGTF-CARIB in support of Operation Uphold Democracy in Haiti. One year later, on June 6, 1995, two Gunrunner cobras, assigned to HMM-263 and the 24th Marine Expeditionary Unit escorted two CH-53Es from the USS Kearsarge to successfully rescue Air Force Captain Scott O'Grady. During this deployment, HMLA-269 also became the first squadron to deploy the new Night Targeting System on all of its cobras; effectively adding increased combat compatibility to the forward deployed forces. Being named the HMLA Squadron of the Year rewarded the squadron's hard efforts that year. The squadron also supported detachments with LF6F deployments that supported Operation Assured Response in Liberia. In 1997 the HMLA detachment to HMM-365 supported Operation Silver Wake in Albania and Operation Guardian Retrieval in the Democratic Republic of Congo. In recognition of its hard-earned reputation for setting the standard in attack helicopter aviation, the Gunrunners were designated the Marine Light Attack Helicopter Squadron of the Year in 1998 by the Marine Corps Aviation Association. =Global War on Terror= HMLA-269 Cobra escorts a MEDEVAC flight near Al Qaim, Iraq on June 17, 2005 during Operation Spear. The desert version of The Gunrunners' new patch In the wake of the September 11, 2001 attacks, The Gunrunners attached to HMM-365 (Rein) with 26th Marine Expeditionary Unit(SOC) flew combat missions in support of Operation Enduring Freedom from Forward Operating Bases Rhino and Kandahar, in Afghanistan. In 2002 The Gunrunners attached to HMM-263 (REIN) with the 24th Marine Expeditionary Unit (SOC) flew in Kosovo, the Horn of Africa, Operation Enduring Freedom. In January 2003, The Gunrunners deployed as a squadron in support of Operation Iraqi Freedom. HMLA-269 flew nearly 3,000 combat hours in 55 days and maintained 24-hour operations with no personnel losses due to enemy action or mishaps. January 2005 saw The Gunrunners again deploy to Iraq in support of OIF 04-06. During this deployment, The Gunrunners flew more than 5951 hours and 3994 sorties. The squadron celebrated its 35th anniversary on July 1, 2006 with a ceremony at Al Asad airbase in western Iraq. The squadron has completed six deployments to Iraq since 2003 and designated Marine Light Attack Helicopter Squadron of Year in 2010 and 2013.

The book became a best-seller. The predicted catastrophes did not occur. History Astronomers had long been aware that there would be an alignment of the planets on that date, when Mercury, Venus, Earth, Mars, Jupiter, Saturn, Uranus, Neptune and Pluto would be on the same side of the Sun, within an arc 95 degrees wide. But no effect could be expected as the tidal forces of the other planets affecting the Earth's crust are negligible even at the planets' closest approach. In this book, the authors sought to partially sidestep these objections by considering the effect of the alignment on the Sun, and hence on the solar wind, which in turn is known to affect weather on the Earth. Atmospheric conditions on the Earth can alter the speed of its rotation. The effect on the Sun would also be quite small, however, and in fact there had been an even closer alignment in the year 1128 without any incident. In April 1982, Gribbin and Plagemann published a lesser-selling book, The Jupiter Effect Reconsidered. In it they theorized that the effect had actually taken place in 1980, despite the lack of planetary alignment then, and that it had triggered the volcanic eruption of Mount St. Helens. In his book, The Little Book of Science (pub. 1999), Gribbin admitted about his \\"Jupiter Effect\\" theory \\"...I don't like it, and I'm sorry I ever had anything to do with it.\\" References to the Jupiter Effect The novel Syzygy, by Frederik Pohl, published in 1981, uses the Jupiter Effect as a source of panic whipped up by religious fanatics, politicians and land speculators in Los Angeles around the time of the alignment. The narrative makes detailed references to the book's arguments and places them in the context of science, the politics of scientific funding, and social reactions. A film version titled The Jupiter Menace was released in 1984, directed by Lee Auerbach and Peter Matulavich, and hosted by George Kennedy. The documentary features interviews with Stephen Plagemann, Jeffrey Goodman and John White (author of Pole Shift), It also includes Biblical prophecy, planetary alignments and survivalism. These topics are covered by interviews with CSA leader James Ellison, psychics Clarissa Bernhardt and Alex Tanous, and members of the Stelle community. The film‚Äôs soundtrack was composed and produced by Larry Fast, under the name Synergy.

It hosts theater-style auditoriums and has 24-hour anime viewing rooms, karaoke, cosplay events, 24-hour video game room/competitions, role-playing games, board games, and talks by guest speakers. The events usually begin 6 p.m. on the Friday of the first weekend of March and continue until Sunday at 6 p.m. with a closing ceremony and announcement of new \\"Con Chair\\". For Genericon XXI, convention staff partnered with Jazzman's Cafe, located in the middle of the convention itself, to bring food and beverages to the convention.Genericon XXI. This practice has since continued. History Genericon began in 1985 as a general science fiction convention, organized by the Rensselaer Science Fiction Association, a student group at RPI. Early conventions were held in the lecture halls of RPI's Russell Sage Laboratory, and featured standard SF convention activities such as lectures and panels, film rooms, a dealers' room, an art show, and filking. Guests of Honor at Genericon 1 were writer Hal Clement, artist Phil Foglio, and fan Jan \\"Wombat\\" Finder. Other guests included Leik Myrabo, Lynn Abbey, Fred Saberhagen, and Professor Alan Meltzer. Subsequent Genericons have included such notable guests as Samuel R. Delany (Genericon II), Joan Vinge (Genericon III), Jack Dann (Genericon III), Barry Longyear (Genericon VII), Christopher Golden (Genericon IX), Vic Mignogna (Genericon XXIV), and Kyle Hebert (GenericonXXVI), Studio Trigger (Genericon XXX and XXXI). Since its founding, Genericon has been held every year, except 1993-1995, as the entirety of the staff had graduated in the year of Genericon VIII[An Informal History o Genericon by Deb Atwood . In recent years, since Genericon X in 1997, the con has gravitated away from its sci-fi roots towards a focus on webcomics, video gaming, and anime, though cosplay and other standard gaming has remained somewhat popular. This is most evident in the fact that guests invited to more recent Genericons have been more from the webcomic industry, including Pete Abrams (Sluggy Freelance), Jeffrey T. Darlington (General Protection Fault, Genericon XV), R. K. Milholland (Something Positive, Genericon XVII), Jeph Jacques (Questionable Content, Genericon XIX and XX), Mohammad Haque (Applegeeks, Genericon XX), and Ananth Hirsh (then Panagariya; Applegeeks, Genericon XX). In 2010, Genericon XXIV introduced a new \\"Featured Panelist\\" system, wherein the convention staff selected a group of panelists deemed to be \\"experts in their field (i.e. popular journalists, podcasters, or industry professionals).\\" The list featured a number of anime bloggers and journalists, as well as a group of RPI alumni who frequently run panels at the convention. . Two new events, Cosplay Ball and Cosplay Cafe , were introduced in 2018 for Genericon XXXI. Genericon XXIV's official attendee count was 1351. By Genericon XXVI the number has climbed to over 2000. Annual activities Every year the following are usually the highlighted events: * Eye Of Argon: A Story poorly written thus reserved to play at 1 a.m. * \\"Clay-O-Rama\\": A RPG with Play-Doh sculptures * Artists Alley/Auction: A room showing submitted work that is also available for sale. * Video games: Everything from Atari to Xbox 360 open 24 hours a day * Magic: The Gathering tournaments and casual play * Vendors: Selling various imports and local products * 24-hour anime rooms : Anime is run throughout the entirety of the convention in at least 1 of the 3 viewing rooms. * Board gaming: Held in the Great Hall of the DCC, a wide variety of board gaming is offered. * RPGs: Held in various conference rooms of the neighboring Low building, a wide variety of table-top role-playing sessions are offered spanning mainstream and indie games. * Guest panels * Cosplay Contest & Masquerade * Cosplay Chess * Cosplay Death Match * Cosplay Dating Game * Genericon Dance/Rave * Karaoke * Anime music videos Contest (as of Genericon XX)  Problems and issues  Sleeping on the convention space has become a problem in recent years. This is a problem since RPI does not allow loiterers. People have been woken up by staff and told to move, or leave campus to sleep elsewhere. R. K. Milholland has expressed a dislike for the con following his attendance as a guest in 2004.http://www.somethingpositive.net/sp04222005.shtml Other webcomic artists, however, have claimed to have enjoyed the con in their visits, including Jeffrey T.

The program first aired in August 2005 on WXOJ, a radio station located in Northampton, Massachusetts, later being nationally syndicated, and eventually achieving broader international distribution in a number of countries, as well as online. The focus of the show is modern North American politics and society, with frequent discussion of economics, science, religion in public life, culture, reason, gay rights, capital punishment and crime, policing, the Israeli‚ÄìPalestinian conflict, North-American foreign policy, technology, and other topical issues. The show is noted for interviewing many fringe, or \\"extremist\\" personalities in an effort to expose their views, in addition to hundreds of interviews with professors, scientists, lawmakers, and others. History David Pakman was born to an Eastern European Jewish family in Buenos Aires, Argentina in February 1984 and moved to the United States at age five. =As Midweek Politics with David Pakman= Pakman started the radio version of the program at age 21 on Pacifica radio affiliate WXOJ while an undergraduate student at the University of Massachusetts Amherst, during his time as an intern at the Media Education Foundation. Public radio syndication began in 2006 on the Pacifica Radio Network. Initially, a handful of non- commercial talk radio stations broadcast the show in syndication. The show expanded in 2007 to more public radio stations. Pakman was for a time the youngest syndicated radio host in the United States. The same year, Louis Motamedi, a childhood friend of Pakman's, was added as radio producer. In 2009, TDPS added its first commercial radio affiliates, starting with Green 1640 in Atlanta, Georgia and WHMP Northampton, Massachusetts. On September 2, Midweek Politics, a simultaneously-produced television show, was launched, originally offered to public-access television stations across the country as well as published on the show's YouTube Channel. The number of television affiliates grew and Pakman attributed this to expanding from radio to a visual medium. Pakman's brother, Natan Pakman, became the program's television director in September 2009. =As The David Pakman Show= In 2010, TDPS launched a paid membership program maintaining the podcast at no charge, but offering subscribers extra show segments, behind-the-scenes interviews, and access to show archives. In July of that year, the show obtained national television distribution through Free Speech TV. The show's first international affiliate, √ñppna Kanalen Sk√∂vde in Sk√∂vde, Sweden, announced in September 2010 that it would be airing the program. At the same time, the show was moved from WXOJ to its own studio in Northampton, Massachusetts, for both the radio and television versions. The name was then changed to The David Pakman Show (TDPS), expanding from a weekly program to two episodes per week, broadcast live on Mondays and Thursdays at 3pm Eastern Standard Time. In August 2012, TDPS moved from a studio in Northampton, Massachusetts to a studio housed on the campus of Greenfield Community College in Greenfield, Massachusetts. In March 2012, TDPS announced an expansion to four episodes per week, Monday- Thursday, and a move to an earlier live broadcast time, 2pm EST. The same year, the show joined The Young Turks network, although it has since left the network. New content and video versions of existing radio programming were produced, including Liberal Oasis Radio Show hosted by blogger Bill Scher, Take Action News with David Shuster, television journalist, and World View with Denis Campbell, Editor-in-Chief of UK Progressive Magazine. As of October 2013, only Word View with Dennis Campbell was being actively produced by TDPS, and as of January 2014, TDPS stopped all production of ancillary content. By the beginning of 2013, The David Pakman Show had on its YouTube channel over 25,000 subscribers and 20 million views. In August 2013, the show moved from Greenfield, Massachusetts to New York City, where the program's main studio was housed until May 2015. Concurrently, producer Louis Motamedi moved to Austin, Texas, where he launched the Austin bureau of The David Pakman Show. Motamedi's role on the program remained unchanged, including serving as co- host, producer, and host of the members only Bonus Show. In 2014 the show expanded to a full 5 shows/week. By early 2015, the show had 100,000 subscribers on YouTube. In November of that year, TDPS moved to a new location in Boston, Massachusetts, with Motamedi returning to Massachusetts to produce the show in-studio. The new location was also the studio of similar progressive-independent program The Benjamin Dixon Show who's host Benjamin Dixon would regularly later fill in for David while he would travel to various political events, and also co-hosted live coverage of the election night on November 8, 2016. During the general election season of 2016, The David Pakman Show YouTube channel passed a quarter-million subscribers and 200 million views. On August 15, 2016 it was announced that producer Louis Motamedi would be leaving the show, in search of a better living environment in the southern United States. His last day on the program (other than later call-in appearances) was August 26, 2016. Temporary producer Jason Shepherd filled in during September, and Patrick Ford became Louis' successor thereafter, becoming the new producer. David returned to hosting the Bonus Show himself. Segment producer Rachel Gordon was also added to appear on a few episodes per week, adding a female co-host to the show, adding a female co-host to the show for a short while. As of late 2019, producer Patrick Ford hosts the Bonus Show on Fridays, while the main show is hosted by David, with Patrick joining into discussions in the other daily bonus shows. Format TDPS is made up of both live and pre-recorded interviews, clips from television and radio programs related to politics and current events, segments with correspondents on the street and in public, and other specially produced segments. Pakman has said that the show is a \\"cross between Howard Stern, Rush Limbaugh, and Rachel Maddow.\\" Content TDPS is a progressive/left-wing/liberal talk radio program, although according to Pakman it notably does not follow what he characterizes as the typically pro-Palestinian view of progressive media in relation to Israel and Palestine, and the Israeli‚ÄìPalestinian conflict. Pakman and TDPS are strong supporters of same-sex marriage, a topic which has often provoked conflict with guests on the program. Additionally, a strong support for the scientific position on evolution, and rebuking of literal Bible interpretation have created conflict with guests. Pakman has regularly indicated that the more outrageous, extreme guests are not only interesting to interview, but create the most interest and engagement on behalf of the audience, and that he often interviews people who \\"would be classified as 'extremists.'\\" This has led to criticism, for example from Arthur Chu that he is indulging in sensationalistic \\"clickbaiting\\" and giving attention and a platform to people who otherwise would not have one. Pakman has argued that interviewing \\"extremists\\" exposes their opinions to the public, putting them on record, and that he does not simply give them a \\"platform\\" to express their views without balance. =Glenn Miller= Political candidate Glenn Miller appeared on Midweek Politics on April 28, 2010. Miller repeated anti-Semitic statements and espoused a number of anti-Jewish conspiracy theories, including control over media and government. Additionally, he referred to host David Pakman as a \\"Jew liar\\" and \\"Kike-a-Like\\" during the interview. Miller also stated that Adolf Hitler was a \\"great man\\" and similarly expressed disappointment that Hitler had not ultimately succeeded in the Holocaust. Video and podcast versions of the interview spread virally throughout the internet garnering varied reaction, ranging from those who found the interview comical and entertaining, to those who were offended, and even a contingent who believed Pakman was wrong to have Miller on the program and should be removed from the air. On the following program, Pakman commented on the uproar and controversy, disagreeing with the notion that people like Miller 'go away' if they do not get on media outlets, and considered the interview a success. Pakman attributed this success to Miller being \\"ridiculed across the internet and on the radio\\". On April 13, 2014, Miller was arrested as the prime suspect in the Overland Park Jewish Community Center shooting. This arrest led to a frenzy of media interest, with Pakman and the original interview featured on CNN, HLN with both Nancy Grace and Dr. Drew, The Huffington Post, The Boston Herald, The Alan Colmes Show, Mother Jones, Raw Story, Democracy Now, WGGB40, The Randi Rhodes Show, and Minneapolis radio station AM950. Miller was later found guilty of capital murder, and was sentenced to death by lethal injection. =Peter LaBarbera= Peter LaBarbera was a guest on the program on July 28, 2010. During the interview, LaBarbera stated numerous times that Pakman's producer should have told him Pakman's position on the issue of gay rights in advance of his appearance, a suggestion that Pakman refuted. This caused controversy, including being the center of a discussion on Sirius XM's The Michelangelo Signorile Show. In later programs, Pakman has mentioned that LaBarbera personally emailed him later to insist that Pakman was dishonest by not telling him in advance about his position on gay rights. During the interview, LaBarbera also discussed his regular trips to gay fetish events, including leather events, and indicated that his group, Americans for Truth About Homosexuality is a \\"pro-family\\" organization. =Paul Cameron= During an interview with Paul Cameron, the anti-gay psychologist and sex researcher, Cameron made a number of comments, among these were the suggestion that homosexuality was equivalent to drug abuse, that homosexuals were addicted to homosexual activity, and cited a study conducted by his own Family Research Institute which reported that gays and lesbians in the military are far more likely to rape or sexually abuse fellow soldiers. The Huffington Post reported on the interview. =Westboro Baptist Church \\"live hack\\"= Members of the Westboro Baptist Church have been interviewed many times on the show, including one incident in which Jake Davis, then only known as \\"Topiary\\", who represented the Anonymous internet collective, announced a live hacking attack on the church's website during a group interview with WBP Spokesperson Shirley Phelps-Roper. =Chaplain Gordon Klingenschmitt= A recurring guest on The David Pakman Show is former Navy Chaplain Gordon Klingenschmitt, who has expressed anti-gay positions, and who was honorably but involuntarily discharged from the Navy after a court-martial proceeding for refusing an order not to appear in uniform at political events to \\"pray in Jesus' name\\". During a notable appearance, Klingenschmitt debated Jonathan Phelps, of the anti-gay Westboro Baptist Church. The interview drew media coverage due to the fact that both men held anti-gay positions, but disagreed on the reasons why being homosexuality is a bad thing. Klingenschmitt is also known for his efforts to shut down the YouTube channel of one of his most vocal critics, Right Wing Watch, which uses video clips of his statements. =Gamergate= Starting in October 2014, Pakman conducted a series of interviews with people involved in Gamergate, a controversy in video game culture. People interviewed included game commentator John \\"TotalBiscuit\\" Bain, 8chan owner Fredrick Brennan and game developer Brianna Wu, among others. Website hacking Shortly after the April 28, 2010, broadcast, visitors to the show's website began to observe that the site was not functioning properly, and sometimes was inaccessible altogether. Denial of service attacks continued, eventually taking the site offline for two days. On the May 12, 2010, broadcast, Pakman announced that the website had indeed been in the target of unknown deliberate malicious attacks starting immediately after the April 28, 2010, broadcast. Pakman did not indicate the specifics of who was suspected to be involved, but said a more detailed investigation was underway, and alluded to a connection between a guest on the program between April 28 and May 12. Guests appearing on Midweek Politics during that time include former Governor Jesse Ventura, Senate candidate Glenn Miller, Congressman Dennis Kucinich, and terrorism expert Richard A. Clarke. Misidentification On January 24, 2013, Pakman came to realize that he had been identified in the documentary film Minnesota Nice as a gay teenager who had committed suicide. Pakman clarified in a YouTube video that he was neither gay, nor a teenager, nor dead. On the April 15, 2014, edition of HLN's Dr. Drew On Call, Pakman was misidentified as former Neo-Nazi and KKK member Frank Meeink. Pakman was scheduled to be interviewed later on during that program. YouTube demonetization The David Pakman Show YouTube channel featured prominently in the YouTube demonetization crisis, known colloquially as \\"Adpocalypse.\\" Both the New York Times and Wired covered Adpocalypse through the lens of The David Pakman Shows YouTube channel.

Description Species in the genus Leucadendron are small trees or shrubs that are erect or creeping. Most species are shrubs that grow up to 1 m tall, some to 2 or 3 m. A few grow into moderate-sized trees up to 16 m tall. All are evergreen. The leaves are largely elliptical, sometimes needle-like, spirally arranged, simple, entire, and usually green, often covered with a waxy bloom, and in the case of the Silvertree, with a distinct silvery tone produced by dense, straight, silky hairs. This inspired the generic name Leucadendron, which literally means \\"white tree\\". The flowers are produced in dense inflorescences at the branch tips; plants are dioecious, with separate male and female plants. The seed heads, or infructescences, of Leucadendron are woody cone- like structures. This gave rise to their generic common name cone-bush. The cones contain numerous seeds. The seed morphology is varied and reflects subgeneric groupings within the genus. A few such as the Silvertree, Leucadendron argenteum have a silky-haired parachute, enabling the large round nut to be dispersed by wind. A few are rodent dispersed, cached by rats, and a few have elaiosomes and are dispersed by ants. About half the species store the seeds in fire-proof cones and release them only after a fire has killed the plant or at least the branch bearing the cone. Many such species hardly recruit naturally except after fires. Cultivation Leucadendron plants are conventionally propagated through seedlings as well as cuttings. The seeds reach maturity over a duration of a year. This time of germination and emergence depends on the species. When using cuttings as propagating material, the season as well as the type of material used can affect the success rate of the cultivation. Cuttings are preferred as propagating material because it provides uniform offspring, whereas seedlings produce genetic variability in the offspring. The genus Leucadendron is more prone to genetic variation than a genus that tends to self-fertilize, because of its cross-pollinating nature. In the natural habitat, Leucadendron grows exceptionally well, but in the case of cultivation the specific needs of the plant have to be readily available to allow optimal production to produce high quality cut flowers and foliage. Steps for cultivation include soil evaluation, clearing, drainage, chemical correction, and the physical preparation should be critically considered five months prior to planting Leucadendrons. The selection criteria for cultivating Leucadendron species is of great importance and should be based on the agricultural ability of the plant as well as the current market standards.

The genus Leucadendron is popular amongst consumers due to its colourful bracts and long vase life. Leucadendron hybrids are produced through interspecific hybridization.Croxford, Yan, and Sedgley, 2003 Crosses made within the same subsection are generally more viable in the hybridization of Leucadendrons with the quantity of seed set relative to the taxonomic relatedness of the species. Intersectional hybridization produces hybrids that show a unique set of characteristics which are favoured by consumers. One example of a hybrid produced by two Leucadendron genera is the cultivar ‚ÄòRosette‚Äô, a hybrid between L. laureolum and L. elimense. This interspecific hybrid is however completely sterile due to autopolyploidy and thus have no use in further cultivation. The main aim of interspecific hybridization is to produce large quantities of progeny seed from the best interspecific hybrid parents. In the UK the cultivars ‚ÄòSafari Sunset‚Äô and ‚ÄòInca Gold‚Äô have gained the Royal Horticultural Society‚Äôs Award of Garden Merit.

Hockey career Wiemer began his path to the pros in Peterborough, Ontario with the Peterborough Petes of the Ontario Hockey League in 1978. He helped his team to the 1979 Memorial Cup Championship and continued his playing career in Peterborough until the end of the 1980‚Äì81 OHL season. Wiemer had his most productive season in 1980‚Äì81 when he recorded 95 points on 41 goals and 54 assists. During his tenure there, he was selected in the 1980 NHL Entry Draft by the Buffalo Sabres with the 83rd pick in the fourth round. Wiemer began his professional career with the Rochester Americans of the American Hockey League (AHL) under coach Mike Keenan. He was originally drafted as a forward and was later moved back to defence by Keenan. He was an integral part in the 1983 Calder Cup Championship run. Wiemer began his National Hockey League career and began to bounce around a bit to the aforementioned teams. He experienced his first trade in the NHL on December 6, 1984, when the Sabres traded Wiemer and Steve Patrick to the New York Rangers in exchange for Chris Renaud and Dave Maloney. In 1986, he was traded by the Rangers to the Edmonton Oilers. In the 1987‚Äì88 season, Wiemer played 12 regular season games, and two games in the Conference Final playoff for the Oilers, and has a Stanley cup Ring. However, his name was not included on the Stanley Cup. The criteria to get your name on the cup is to play 41 or more games for the winning team during the regular season, and/or one game played in the Stanley Finals. After playing mostly for the Oilers' farm team in the AHL the next season, he was traded to the Los Angeles Kings in March 1989. In July 1989, Wiemer signed as a free agent with the Boston Bruins where he found a solid home. Under coach Mike Milbury, Wiemer was a solid fixture on the blueline with Boston for the better part of four seasons. Wiemer was a member of the Bruins' organization for one more season with their AHL team. In 1994, Wiemer returned to the Rochester Americans for his final season. Wiemer finished his playing career with 325 games played in the NHL (387 including playoffs). He scored 101 (114 including playoffs) points in his NHL career on 29 goals and 72 assists (34 and 80 including playoffs) with 378 penalty minutes and a plus/minus of +17 (437 and +14 including playoffs). Over his full professional career, he scored 999 career points. Awards * 1985‚Äì86 - Eddie Shore Award as the AHL's top defenceman. In 2010, Wiemer was inducted into the Rochester Americans Hall of Fame along with former teammate Randy Cunneyworth and trainer Kent Weisbeck.

Typically, a character's individual strengths and weaknesses are represented by a set of statistics. Games with a largely fictional setting may include traits such as race and class. Games with a more contemporary or narrower setting may limit customization to physical and personality traits. Role-playing games Character creation is typically the first step taken by the players (as opposed to the gamemaster) in preparation for a game. The result of character creation is a direct characterization that is recorded on a character sheet. In its most comprehensive form it includes not only a game-specific representation of the character's physical, mental, psychological and social properties in terms of statistics, but also often less formal descriptions of the character's physical appearance, personality, personal back-story (\\"background\\") and possessions. During play, only a character's appearance is usually described explicitly while other traits are characterized indirectly, with the exact statistics known to the character's player and the game master, but not necessarily to other players. Character advancement refers to the improvement of a character's statistics later in the game. The player will modify existing stats and add new ones, usually by spending experience points or when gaining a new experience level. Character advancement typically uses similar rules as character creation. To avoid unrealistic sudden changes in character concept, though, character advancement is usually more restricted than the initial character creation. For example, attributes are almost always harder (if not impossible) to change during character advancement. The term character development is, in some contexts, used interchangeably with character advancement (in a sense similar to professional development or Human Development), whereas elsewhere character development refers instead to the player's indirect characterization of the character through role-playing (in a sense similar to film developing).  Making decisions  Character creation screen in S.C.O.U.R.G.E.: Heroes of Lesser Renown. A character's initial attribute scores are usually either generated randomly or determined by distributing character points, and some systems use a combination of both possibilities. Some game systems allow attribute scores to be increased later in the game in a way similar to skills (but much less frequently), usually by some sort of point distribution system. Characters can also gain a number of skills. What types of skills the characters can learn and how easily they can be learned usually depends on if the character creation system is \\"class based\\" or \\"skill based\\". The process of creating a character for a given game involves a number of decisions: What advantages and disadvantages will the character have? What particular statistic will a certain value be assigned to? What values are there to assign anyway? For most of them, there will be a rule outlining by whom and how it can be made. Most of these rules can be classified into one of the three groups described below. They differ in several aspects, the most prominent being ease of use as well as game balance and diversity of the generated results. So, most decisions in character creation are made according to the following principles: Prescription: The decision is predetermined by the rules (often by a formula or a table that maps one or more already-established statistics to a specific choice for another), or it is made by the game master prior to character creation. Examples would be the skill bonuses a character gets from his attributes in many games (which are usually determined by a table or a simple formula) or the number of character points a player gets to use for character creation (in GURPS, for example, this is set by the game master). This method facilitates fast and easy decisions that are likely to be balanced according to the judgement of the game's author and the game master, but doesn't allow for variation if not combined with other options. In an extreme case, characters are completely predesigned by the author of a scenario, but even then, players usually may choose their character from the selection provided. This technique is often used to save time for short games run on gaming conventions. Random Choice: Random choices are usually made by rolling dice and either using the result directly or looking it up in a table, depending on the decision that is to be made. For example, in Dungeons & Dragons 3rd edition the player rolls 4d6 and adds the highest three numbers to generate an ability score (attribute value) from 3 to 18. In the first editions of the Stormbringer roleplaying game, the character's race and class both are determined by rolling 1d100 and looking up the result in the appropriate table. Usually, a random generation system allows the full (or at least a rather large) range of values to be generated for each stat, leading to a great diversity among newly generated characters. Thus, it is possible for a character to start the game with all- maximum scores (or nearly so). On the other hand, players have very little control over the scores, and rolling low scores can be very frustrating for some players. This method is generally less concerned with game balance than with ease of use. Player's Choice: Another option is to let the player make decisions, normally within clearly defined restrictions. These restrictions often involve allowing players to distribute a number of character points among various statistics. In such a point distribution system, higher scores often cost more points per level than lower ones, and costs may vary between statistics even within a category. Usually, there is an upper and lower limit for each score. Additional constraints may apply, depending on the game system. How these points are spent will usually determine if the character will refer to himself as a warrior, a thief, or a scholar. If a player wants to be a fighter/mage/thief/cleric he can -- as long as he spends his skill points in the right way. Examples for systems that almost exclusively use point distribution to determine statistics are (in roughly chronological order) the Hero System (including its predecessor Champions), GURPS, the World of Darkness series, and the Amber Diceless Roleplaying Game with its unusual auction system. Dungeons & Dragons 3rd edition also has an optional point buy method for determining ability scores. Point distribution gives the players much control over the character creation process and tends to make characters highly customizable. If the system is designed well, characters are usually more balanced than randomly created ones. On the other hand, this method is almost always more complicated and time-consuming than random generation. Narrative Generation: As used for example in the Traveller and Harnmaster RPGs or some cRPGs such as Mount & Blade and Darklands, this technique models a character's life prior to becoming an active adventurer with the player choosing family origin and then making further decisions at specific life \\"checkpoints\\" - for example early education, young adulthood and one or more \\"tours of duty\\" in various careers. Each stage will apply certain modifiers and give the character the opportunity to develop skills, advantages and possibly possessions - or to suffer setbacks and disadvantages. In some cases a player may run through repeated career cycles to sacrifice character youth for additional skills, experience and material advancement. Levels of randomization and player agency vary dependent on the specific system - in some it is entirely possible for a character to die during the creation process and the player to need to start again from scratch...  Determining numerical values  Determining numerical values comprises several steps that are not always distinct: #(a) Obtain a set of values and (b) select the statistics to assign them to #Assign the values to the statistics #Possibly adjust statistics scores by ‚Äúshifting around‚Äù (stat) levels. Example: In Castle Falkenstein, abilities are the only type of statistic. Each player gets the same pre-defined set of scores (1a) and can freely choose (1b) which abilities he wants them to assign to (2). In addition, higher scores can be bought by balancing them with a number of low scores (3). = Obtaining and assigning values = Games that don't use point distribution to determine all statistics values typically use different methods for different types of statistic: In general, there are comparatively few attributes, and each one explicitly is assigned a value. Conversely, there are generally a rather large number of skills, and each character learns only some of them while the others are left at their respective default values. Here are some examples: * To determine attribute values in Basic Dungeons & Dragons, Marvel Super Heroes, or Stormbringer 3rd edition, for example, the player rolls once (1a) for each attribute (1b) and must use whatever result occurred on the dice for that statistic (2). If for different attributes a different number of dice is used (as is the case for non-humans in Palladium, for instance), this is the most feasible option. * D&D 3.5, on the other hand, allows the player to first randomly generate a number of values (1a) and then assign (2) each attribute one of them (1b). * For determining skill values, Stormbringer 3rd edition combines two methods: Some of them (1b) are predetermined (1a, 2) by the character's randomly chosen profession (and race). The player then selects a randomly determined number of additional skills (1b) and rolls dice (1a) to determine starting values for them (2). = Adjusting scores = Some creation systems use a mix of point-distribution and random generation; most common among these are variant rules that allow, for instance, the alteration of the initially random stats by taking a reduction of one trait in order to increase another. Often, such adjustments are made at a penalty, applying a two-for-one cost, for instance. Another form of adjustment are racial or occupational (\\"class\\") modifiers. In many games, certain statistics are slightly increased or decreased depending on the character's race and sometimes profession. In Dungeons & Dragons, for example, non-human races typically increase one ability score by two (on a scale of 3 to 18) while another is lowered by the same amount. In Stormbringer 3rd edition, nearly all nationalities (subraces) cause adjustments of some or all attribute scores by an amount that is usually randomly determined and has a range of up to two-thirds of an attribute's initial value. In point-distribution systems, these modifiers generally contribute to a race's \\"point cost\\", while in other systems, it is up to the race's designer to balance different races against each other (if this is desired).  Templates and classes  Class selection screen in Falcon's Eye. To speed up and ease the character creation process, many games use character templates of some sort: Sample characters representing genre-typical archetypes that are either completely ready-made or at least define the essential stats necessary for a character to be able to work in a given occupation or fill some dramatic role. For instance, a thief will probably know how to move quietly, pick locks, disarm traps, and climb walls. The use of character templates enables inexperienced players to easily create suitable characters as they won't be overwhelmed with having to select skills and abilities, and it still speeds up character creation for even the most experienced players. In some games, these templates are only an optional character creation aid that has no prescribed effect on the rest of the game: They can be flexibly modified according to the game's character creation rules or can be ignored altogether. This is generally the case in games that try to give the player as much control over the character creation process as possible. (Examples are Shadowrun or GURPS.) Other games use such a mechanism as a mandatory tool to provide direction and limitations to the character creation process as well as character development. This is the character class concept introduced by Dungeons & Dragons that is now used in all d20 System games and has been adopted by many others, such as Palladium Books' Megaversal system. With a character class, most skills and abilities are predetermined, or must be chosen from a comparably narrow subset of all available traits, leaving the player to select only a few extra skills. Some people find this too limiting, while others like the fact that each character necessarily has to be specialized to fill a specific role in the group of player characters. In a class-based system, a fighter is often not allowed any magical abilities, while mages are typically poor fighters. When players are not required do adhere to a specific template, on the other hand, their characters might turn out very similar even if they started from different templates -- a fighter with good spell casting abilities is not much different from a spell caster with good fighting abilities. Thus, the freedom of a class-less system requires extra caution on the side of the players to create a diverse group of characters. There are games that aim to get the best of both worlds by using some kind of hybrid. One approach is to let the templates (called careers in Classic Traveller as well as in Warhammer Fantasy Roleplay) still restrict the choices available for character creation or development, but apply them only for a limited timespan: During character creation in Classic Traveller, each character pursues one of six possible careers (professions) that decides which tables can be used to roll on, thus giving direction to the otherwise largely random process. When the character is ready to be played, he has ended this career, so it doesn't have a direct influence on character development during play. Warhammer Fantasy Roleplay has a much more elaborate career system. Characters advance by entering a series of \\"careers\\" that provide access to a set of new or improved skills, and bonuses to attributes (called \\"advances\\"). The menu of careers available to characters reflects the setting of the game world. Basic careers are those that might be filled by any individual with a modest amount of training or instruction. Advanced careers require greater preparation and training, and are often more appropriate for the lifestyle of an active adventurer. The career system gives both an idea of what a character might have been doing before embarking on a career as an adventurer (working as a baker, night watchman, rat catcher, or farmer), and how they changed and developed through their career (becoming a mercenary, explorer, ship's captain, etc.). As another approach, some games (such as Cyberpunk 2020) use a hybrid skill-class system, in which each of the primary roles (classes) in the game has one skill that is absolutely unique to it and defines that role, but apart from that, characters are created and advance using a skill point system rather than a class-and-level system. Sports games In sports games, creating players involves choosing features like skin color and vital stats. This may also be extended to creating entire teams of players. Common skills such as running and passing may be customized, as well as skills that are more specific to individual sports.

Gwatkin ed., The Cambridge Medieval History Vol. II (Cambridge 1926) p. 641-2 \\\\- the Germanic comitatus eventually evolved into a wholesale exchange between a social superior and inferior. The feudal social inferior or vassal would pledge military service and protection to the superior (Lord). In return, the superior would reward the inferior with land, compensation, or privileges. Nomenclature The Germanic term for the comitatus is reconstructed as *druhtiz, with Old English forms dryht and druht, and Scandinavian dr√≥tt.For the reconstruction and Old English forms, see Pollington, S., \\"Origins of the Warband\\" in TYR, vol. 2 (Ultra Press, 2004), p. 130. For the Scandinavian form, see Thurston, T. L., \\"Social Classes in the Viking Age\\" in Landscapes of Power, Landscapes of Conflict: State Formation in the South Scandinavian Iron Age (Springer, 2001), p. 115. Equivalents highlighting different features of the lord/man bond include the trust-element of the early Frankish antrustio, royal bodyguard;J. M. Wallace- Hadrill, The Barbarian West (London 1964) p. 111 the Danish vederlag or Society, and the Norse hird or household following.H.M. Gwatkin ed., The Cambridge Medieval History Vol. II (Cambridge 1926) p. 642 Women The Wife's Lament in the Exeter Book uses the language of the comitatus to sharpen awareness of the conflict between the wife's claim on her lover, and the brotherhood-claims of the lord and his followers:A. Klinck, Medieval Women's Song (2002) p. 218 In the words of the Wife's Lament, \\"that man's kinsmen began to think in secret that they would separate us.\\" How typical this is of the medieval genre of the frauenlied ‚Äì with the romantic theme of a woman being left by her husband because he needs to be with his liege lord ‚Äì is however debatable.A. Klinck, Medieval Women's Song (2002) p. 218 Even in Anglo-Saxon England, if the Exeter Book contains few pieces featuring women or written from the female perspective, Beowulf by contrast has roles for women precisely in strengthening the cohesion and unity of the comitatus:R. Bjork, A Beowulf Handbook (1997) p. 314 thus the 'peace-weaver' Queen Wealtheow makes the normative claim that ‚ÄúHere each comrade is true to the other/loyal to lord, loving in spirit./The thanes have one purpose, the people are ready:/having drunk and pledged, the ranks do as I bid.‚Äù.Seamus Heaney trans., Beowulf (London 2000) p. 41 See also References *Enright, M.J., Lady with a Mead Cup: Ritual, Prophecy, and Lordship in the European Warband.

Many of the songs are about the nostalgic longing for Naples as it once was. The genre consists of a large body of composed popular music‚Äîsuch songs as \\"‚ÄôO sole mio\\"; \\"Torna a Surriento\\"; \\"Funicul√¨, Funicul√†\\"; \\"Santa Lucia\\" and others. The Neapolitan song became a formal institution in the 1830s due to an annual song-writing competition for the Festival of Piedigrotta, dedicated to the Madonna of Piedigrotta, a well-known church in the Mergellina area of Naples. The winner of the first festival was a song entitled Te voglio bene assaie; it is traditionally attributed to the prominent opera composer Gaetano Donizetti, although an article published in 1984 by Marcello Sorce Keller shows there is no historical evidence in support of the attribution. The festival ran regularly until 1950, when it was abandoned. A subsequent Festival of Neapolitan Song on Italian state radio enjoyed some success in the 1950s but was eventually abandoned as well. The period since 1950 has produced such songs as Malafemmena by Tot√≤, Maruzzella by Renato Carosone, Indifferentemente by Mario Trevi and Carmela by Sergio Bruni. Although separated by some decades from the earlier classics of this genre, they have now become Neapolitan \\"classics\\" in their own right. History Many of the Neapolitan songs are world-famous because they were taken abroad by emigrants from Naples and southern Italy roughly between 1880 and 1920.The music also was popularized abroad by performers such as Enrico Caruso, who took to singing the popular music of his native city as encores at the Metropolitan Opera in New York in the early 1900s. Caruso also recorded many of these songs, which subsequently became part of the standard repertoire for operatic tenors, and which were performed and recorded by such notable singers as Beniamino Gigli, Francesco Albanese, Franco Corelli, Mario Del Monaco, Giuseppe Di Stefano, and Tito Schipa. The Three Tenors also performed popular songs from Naples. Pl√°cido Domingo recorded a full CD Italia ti amo of traditional and some more modern Neapolitan and Italian songs. Luciano Pavarotti recorded three albums of Neapolitan and Italian songs: The Best: Disc 2, (2005), Pavarotti Songbook, (1991), and Romantica, (2002). Mario Lanza recorded an acclaimed selection of 12 Neapolitan songs on his 1959 album, Mario! Lanza At His Best. Opera/pop crossover tenor, Sergio Franchi recorded his very popular Billboard Top 25 RCA debut album, Romantic Italian Songs in 1962,http://www.allrovi.com Sergio Franchi and continued to record Neapolitan songs on most of his albums throughout his career.http.www.discogs.com Sergio Franchi Andrea Bocelli recorded an album in 2009 dedicated to the style, entitled Incanto. The most important native Neapolitan performers of Neapolitan songs in the last few decades include Roberto Murolo, Bruno Venturini, Mario Trevi, Mario Abbate, Mario Merola, Giulietta Sacco, Franco Ricci, Sergio Bruni, Renato Carosone, and Mario Maglione. Murolo is known not only as a singer and guitarist, but also as a composer, scholar and collector of the music; his collection of twelve LPs, released in the 1960s, is an annotated compendium of Neapolitan song dating back to the twelfth century. Representatives of different veins, but nevertheless leading the continuing tradition of song in Neapolitan, are the jazz-rock singer-songwriter Pino Daniele and the folkloric group Nuova Compagnia di Canto Popolare.:it:Nuova Compagnia di Canto Popolare An important factor in defining what makes a Neapolitan song is the matter of language. All these songs are written and performed in the Neapolitan language. Although the music is sung by many non- Neapolitan singers, it is difficult to sing correctly without knowledge of the Neapolitan dialect, which is crucial in obtaining the correct inflection. The matter of dialect has not prevented a few non-Neapolitans from writing dialect versions of Neapolitan songs. The most famous example of this is ‚ÄôA vucchella by Gabriele D'Annunzio.

He is the founder and director of the Stanford Persuasive Technology Lab, later renamed as Behavior Design Lab. Education Brian Jeffrey Fogg was born in 1963 in Dallas. He later grew up in Fresno, California. Raised in a Mormon family with six siblings, Fogg went to Peru for a two-year mission at age 18.http://tinyhabitsacademy.org/about-us/ Fogg has a B.A. and MA. in English from Brigham Young University and a PhD in Communications from Stanford, where he served as a teaching assistant to Philip Zimbardo. Career From 1992 to 1993, Fogg was \\"one of the founders of the Student Review, Brigham Young University's independent student newspaper\\" and \\"taught English and design at BYU.\\" While at BYU, Fogg published eight short stories and poems in Dialogue: A Journal of Mormon Thought; Sunstone, \\"a quarterly journal of Mormon experience, scholarship, issues, and art\\"; and other Mormon-affiliated publications. His Masters thesis, \\"Terms of Address Among Latter-Day Saints\\" and \\"Names Mormons Use for Jesus: Contexts and Trends\\" were both published by the Deseret Language and Linguistics Society Symposium in February 1990 and March 1991, respectively. In 1998, Fogg published a peer-reviewed paper, Persuasive Computers: Perspectives and Research Directions, which included a section that \\"proposes ethical responsibilities for designers of persuasive computers and captology researchers, and discusses the importance of educating about persuasion.\\" In 1999, he was the guest editor for an issue of ACM focusing on persuasive technologies. In 2003, Fogg published the book, Persuasive Technology: Using Computers to Change What We Think and Do. This book provided a foundation for captology, the study of Computers As Persuasive Technologies. In it, he discusses the implications of macrosuasion and microsuasion‚Äîterms he uses to define and describe the persuasive intent of a product, providing examples across the web, in video games, and other software products. In 2006, Fogg and some of his students created a video for consideration by the FTC about persuasive technology. In 2007, Fogg co-taught a Stanford course about Facebook Apps with Dave McClure, where students used persuasive design to create Facebook apps that amassed millions of users during the 10-week course. The New York Times quoted Fogg as referring to it as \\"a period of time when you could walk in and collect gold.\\" In 2009, Fogg published the Fogg Behavior Model (FBM), a model for analyzing and designing human behavior. The FBM describes three conditions needed for a behavior to occur: (1) motivation (2) ability and (3) a prompt. Motivation can be influenced by factors like pleasure/pain, hope/fear, and social acceptance/rejection. Ability can be impacted by time, money, physical effort, brain cycles, social deviance, and non-routine. Prompts are also referred to as triggers. In December 2011, Fogg developed a method to develop habits from baby steps, which he calls \\"Tiny Habits\\". He gave two TEDx talks on this and related topics. He was the founder and director of Stanford's Mobile Health conference (2008‚Äì2012).

After leaving Return to Forever, he recorded three acoustic albums and then three electric albums as a leader/soloist.\\"the complex and highly talented young guitarist, Bill Connors\\" (Nemko, Guitar Player, 1974; \\"Bill Connors has been admired by aficionados and fellow players for his finely developed musical sense since he first broke on the national scene\\" (Santoro, Guitar Player, 1985); \\"Bill Connors has always lived and played ahead of the times\\" (Messer, Guitar Player, 2005); \\"Bill Connors was the 'cry of love' in fusion guitar\\" (Vernon Reid, 100 Years of Jazz Guitar, Columbia Records).  Early years  Connors was born in Los Angeles, California, in 1949 and began to play the guitar at the age of 14. After three years of extensive self-study of the rock and blues influences that were his first inspiration, he began to play gigs around the Los Angeles area with a heavy blues/rock group called Middle Earth. He found his way to jazz, the music that would lead to a lifelong commitment. \\"I'd been playing for about four years\\", he explained at the time of his RTF tenure, \\"and suddenly had an overnight change. I didn't want to be a blues guitarist anymore. I began listening to people like Bill Evans, Jim Hall, Wes Montgomery, [bassist] Scott LaFaro, Miles Davis, [John] Coltrane‚Äîanyone who had a 'jazz' label. Django Reinhardt really got to me. The first time I heard one of his records, I thought that was just what I wanted to be. He had all the fire, creativity, and energy that rock players have today. And the amazing purity of his melodies‚Äîyou just knew they came from a totally instinctive place.\\"Connors, interview with Frankie Nemko, Guitar Player, October 1974. He and Django differed however over the matter of electronics with Bill preferring the sound of the electric instrument. \\"I always wanted to use the electric guitar in a sophisticated context, like with Chick [Corea]. I like to play jazz with that electric-rock sound. For me it's a lot closer to a horn than the traditional guitar, and that's what I love about it; I can sustain notes, get into different kinds of phrasing‚Äîdo things other instruments do naturally, only the guitar does it with the aid of technology.\\" Connors moved to San Francisco in 1972 to join the Mike Nock Group (formerly known as The Fourth Way) with drummer Eddie Marshall and bassist Dennis Parker. He met up with drummer and vibraphonist Glenn Cronkhite, who introduced him to greater knowledge of jazz. Connors also played with bassist Steve Swallow and pianist Art Lande.  Return to Forever  In 1973, after sitting in on a gig, Connors joined Return to Forever, a fusion band led by keyboardist Chick Corea's that included bassist Stanley Clarke and drummer Steve Gadd. \\"A miracle!\\" Bill claims. \\"Chick was my hero. I wanted to be Chick Corea on guitar. I didn't know him, but whenever I really wanted to get off on music I'd play some of his piano solos and Return to Forever songs. I heard that Chick was looking for a guitarist. Steve encouraged me to call Chick, and though I was very nervous, I did, and he invited me to come over to the club where he was working and sit in. I was so scared that I almost turned him down. But after running around and saying to everyone, 'Guess who I'm going to play with tonight,' and everyone telling everyone else, all this energy was formulating ‚Äì and I took to my room and practiced my ass off.\\" That night the fear disappeared. \\"The minute I got up on stage I had this feeling like I'd been preparing for this all my life. I was so relaxed that I felt as though I was in my own living room. Chick and I played musical games ‚Äì he'd play these real simple lines and I'd be giving my interpretations of them, then go off into the Chick Corea 'outness.' I ended up in New York two weeks later.\\" With Corea's band of Stanley Clarke and drummer Lenny White, Connors established himself on the national and international music scenes, touring in Japan and Europe, and recording the album Hymn of the Seventh Galaxy (1973). In April 1974, after the band's tour of Europe and Japan, Bill quit the group. The musical direction seemed to him to be changing from what it was when Connors joined. He explains, \\"Everything started getting less aesthetic, more rock. Just too much like Mahavishnu. I was having trouble expressing myself the way I wanted to in that context.\\" Connor's disenchantment with the group also stemmed from certain objections to Corea's Scientology-inspired leadership style. \\"Chick had a lot of ideas that were part of his involvement with Scientology. He got more demanding, and I wasn't allowed to control my own solos. I had no power in the music at all. Then, we'd receive written forms about what clothes we could wear, and graphic charts where we had to rate ourselves every night ‚Äì not by our standards, but his. Finally, we had to connect dots on a chart every night. I took all of it seriously because I had a lot of respect for Chick, but eventually I just felt screwed around. In the end, my only power was to quit.\\" After Return to Forever  In 1974, Connors left Return to Forever, and began to explore the New York jazz and session scene, performing with guitarist John Abercrombie and keyboardist Jan Hammer, and recording with former Return to Forever bandmate Stanley Clarke. \\"It was great,\\" he stated in a 1985 interview, \\"because it wasn't this contrived thing in order to communicate to the audience. We were *playing* again and *learning* again, and it felt real good.\\"Connors, interview with Gene Santoro, Guitar Player, 1985. During this period, recording with vocalist Gene McDaniels and Stanley Clarke kept the guitarist's creative impulses occupied with a variety of challenges‚Äîbut not for long. \\"Around 1975, I'd decided to become a classical guitar player\\", he muses. \\"I did my first solo album in 1974, and just decided on the spur of the moment to do it all on acoustic. That was just such a contrast from blowing people's ears off with my 200-watt Marshall that it really started to capture me.\\" A further impetus came with Connors' discovery of classical artist Julian Bream. \\"I was sitting with his album 20th Century Guitar‚Äîa real classic‚Äîand it has this piece by [German composer] Henze that I really loved. It was just getting to me, so I sat down for a couple of days and transcribed it‚Äîon my steel-string guitar, with my funny pick-and-finger technique [laughs]. When I got it, it gave me so much pleasure that I said, 'Okay, I'm going to be a classical guitar player.' And that's what happened.\\" Connors recorded his solo album Theme to the Guardian (ECM) in 1974, making the switch from electric to acoustic guitar. Simultaneously he began to study classical guitarists. Two more albums on acoustic guitar followed: Of Mist and Melting (1978, ECM) with saxophonist Jan Garbarek, bassist Gary Peacock, and drummer Jack DeJohnette and Swimming with a Hole in My Body (1980, ECM). During 1976 and 1977, Connors recorded with Lee Konitz, Paul Bley, and Jimmy Giuffre in New York City. He toured Europe, performing with Luciano Berio and Cathy Berberian. He returned to electric guitar, performing and recording with Garbarek on Places (1978) and Photo with Blue Sky, White Cloud, Wires, Windows and a Red Roof (1979) and with Tom van der Geld and Richard Jannotta on Path (ECM) in 1979. In 1985, Connors recorded Step It with Steve Khan on guitar, Tom Kennedy on bass, and Dave Weckl on drums. His next album, Double Up (1986), included bassist Kennedy and drummer Kim Plainfield. The same trio (Connors, Kennedy, Plainfield) recorded Assembler in 1987. Connors has been giving private lessons while continuing his studies. He plays plectrum style on a classical jazz guitar and a Gibson L-5 CES archtop electric. Other guitars are a Gibson Les Paul Custom and an Ovation guitar (electro-acoustic model).

Note: This includes , , and Accompanying three photographs The site was designed by the American architect, Henry Hobson Richardson, in concert with the famed landscape team of Frederick Law Olmsted and Calvert Vaux in the late 1800s, incorporating a system of enlightened treatment for people with mental illness developed by Dr. Thomas Story Kirkbride. Over the years, as mental health treatment changed and resources were diverted, the buildings and grounds began a slow deterioration. In 2006, the Richardson Center Corporation was formed to restore the buildings. Today, the Richardson Olmsted Campus is being converted, beginning with the now open Hotel Henry Urban Resort Conference Center and 100 Acres: The Kitchens at Hotel Henry, both within the Towers Building and two flanking buildings (about one-third of the Campus). The Richardson Olmsted Campus will also house The Lipsey Architecture Center Buffalo. The remaining buildings have been stabilized pending future opportunities.

The campus consists of a central administrative tower and five pavilions or wards progressively set back on each side, for eleven buildings total, all connected by short curved two-story corridors. Patients were segregated by sex, males on the east side, females on the west. The wards housed patients until the mid-1970s. The central administration building was used for offices until 1994. The campus, the largest commission of Richardson's career, marks the advent of his characteristic Romanesque Revival style. When emulated by later architects, this style is referred to as Richardsonian Romanesque. It has been the subject of a long-term preservation campaign. Nevertheless, three pavilions on the east side were demolished in the 1970s to make way for newer psychiatric facilities.Archives: Architecture: A towering masterpiece: H.H.

In 1927, the northern farmlands were transferred back to the State for the development of what is today Buffalo State College. In 1973, the Asylum was added to the National Register of Historic Places and in 1986, it was designated a National Historic Landmark. Patient records from 1881 to 1975 are in the collection of the New York State Archives in Albany, NY. Architectural plans and drawings are in the H.H. Richardson Collection in the Houghton Library at Harvard University. =Preservation efforts= South elevation of the Administration Building in 1965. The Preservation Coalition of Erie County (renamed \\"Preservation Buffalo Niagara\\" in October 2008) filed a lawsuit resulting in New York State establishing the Richardson Center Corporation in 2006 to rehabilitate the site and the State committing $100 million towards rehabilitation. Both former New York State Assembly Member Sam Hoyt, and former Buffalo State College President Muriel A. Howard, were involved in plans for the restoration and reuse of the Richardson.Hoyt proposes civic panel for Richardson site, Buffalo News, Buffalo, NY: Berkshire Hathaway, 22 January 2004, Sommer, M., Retrieved 15 January 2014. Perimeter fencing and lighting were installed and a Peace Officer was hired to conduct regular patrols and prevent and deter further crime at the complex. On March 5, 2008, stabilization began with the most severely damaged buildings, including the roof and down-spouts. Stabilization was completed in 2012. On April 10, 2010, a fire occurred. The cause of the fire was under investigation. Damage was estimated at $200,000. In 2013, the South Lawn landscape on the property was completed. During the planning stages, the Richardson Center Corporation has used an active public process, aimed to help to inform the Master Plan during all phases of redevelopment for the Campus, including several public meetings. A Community Advisory Group includes representatives from the adjacent neighborhoods, business districts, cultural institutions, Buffalo Psychiatric Center, SUNY Buffalo State, and historic preservation groups. =Hotel Henry Urban Resort Conference Center= On January 25, 2013, Phase I plans were announced to redevelop on third of the Campus into Hotel Henry Urban Resort Conference Center, 100 Acres: The Kitchens at Hotel Henry and the Buffalo Architecture Center, both within the Towers Building and two flanking buildings. This first phase of redevelopment was completed in 2016. Hotel Henry and the 100 Acres opened in May 2017, and the architecture center will open thereafter. In popular culture In 1983 a portion of a ground floor hallway and one hospital room were prepared to appear as a maternity ward and used as a location for The Natural, where the character Roy Hobbs, as played by Robert Redford, was shown recovering from internal injuries. Mount Massive Asylum, the main setting for the 2013 horror game Outlast, was modeled after the Richardson Olmsted Complex.

XED builds on X.500 and LDAP directory services technologies. XED was originally designed in 2003 by Steven Legg of eNitiatives (formerly of eB2Bcom and Adacel Technologies) and Daniel Prager (formerly of Deakin University). The XML Enabled Directory (XED) framework leverages existing Lightweight Directory Access Protocol (LDAP) and X.500 directory technology to create a directory service that stores, manages and transmits Extensible Markup Language (XML) format data, while maintaining interoperability with LDAP clients, X.500 Directory User Agents (DUAs), and X.500 Directory System Agents (DSAs). The main features of XED are: * semantically equivalent XML renditions of existing directory protocols, * XML renditions of directory data, * the ability to accept at run time, user defined attribute syntaxes specified in a variety of XML schema languages, * the ability to perform filter matching on the parts of XML format attribute values. * the flexibility for implementors to develop XED clients using only their favoured XML schema language. The XML Enabled Directory allows directory entries to contain XML formatted data as attribute values. Furthermore, the attribute syntax can be specified in any one of a variety of XML schema languages that the directory understands. The directory server is then able to perform data validation and semantically meaningful matching of XML documents, or their parts, on behalf of client applications, making the implementation of XML-based applications easier and faster. XML applications can also exploit the directory's traditional capabilities of cross-application data sharing, data distribution, data replication, user authentication and user access control, further lowering the cost of building new XML applications XED Implementations eNitiatives's ViewDS Discovery Server provides organisations with a fast, scalable and flexible directory system. As it has been developed strictly adhering to open standards and it features support for the X.500, LDAP, XED and ACP133 Standards. Being standards compliant, ViewDS will interface with a variety of applications, both now and into the future.

Known locally as \\"Smedley's Folly\\" because of the difficulty of getting water to the hill summit, it was built by the industrialist John Smedley in 1862 as his private home. His wife lived in it until her death. It is built of gritstone from a local quarry (Derbyshire is well known for its quarrying) which was pulled up the hill by a series of pulleys. After the death of Smedley's wife, the castle became a boys' prep school until this became financially unsustainable in the 1930s. The architectural historian John Summerson attended the school in the early 20th century. While he enjoyed his time at the school, the building's architecture had lesser appeal; he described the castle as \\"an object of indecipherable bastardy ‚Äì a true monster\\". With the coming of World War II the Ministry of Defence used the site for food storage. The MoD left following the war and the castle remained unused until the 1960s. From the 1960s to September 2000 it was home to a wildlife park, containing British and European fauna. Riber Castle Wildlife Park, or Riber Zoo as it was known, was eventually sold by the owner. The original owners sold the wildlife Park as a going concern. The subsequent owners were criticised heavily for the treatment of the animals kept there, and the closure was not without controversy. The original owners bred lynx which were later released in a European mountain range. Plans to turn the shell into apartments received planning consent on 15 March 2006. The castle walls have now been secured, chimneys and floors rebuilt, 119 windows replaced and a roof added. It was expected that two show apartments would be ready some time in 2014. Access to the site before 2006 was securely restricted, until the perimeter fence was unwired to provide unrestricted access to the site, which later became a commonly used footpath. However, recently developers have added a second (more secure) fence, boarded up all entrance points and have manned security onsite. The castle and the town of Matlock are key locations in the Shane Meadows film Dead Man's Shoes.

He was inducted in the National Museum of Racing and Hall of Fame in 1970. Known by his middle name, Wyndham, in 1872 Walden and his wife Caroline moved from New York City to Middleburg in Carroll County, Maryland where they established \\"Bowling Brook Farm\\" to breed and train thoroughbred race horses. Wyndham Walden trained his first Preakness Stakes winner in 1875, Tom Ochiltree, then two years later began a streak of five straight victories, all of which came with horses owned by George L. Lorillard. Walden won the Preakness for a seventh time in 1888 with his own horse, Refund. The win set a record for a trainer which still stands, and is tied with Bob Baffert's seven wins. During a career spanning thirty-one years between 1872 and 1902, he also won the Belmont Stakes four times and trained more than 100 Stakes race winners. His son Robert J. Walden won the 1899 Kentucky Derby with Manuel, owned by the Morris brothers, Alfred and Dave. His daughter married jockey Fred Littlefield who rode Refund to his 1888 Preakness Stakes victory and was aboard Bowling Brook for the win in the 1898 Belmont Stakes.

Many of the controversies have centered on the show's voting process and results, and in later seasons, gender bias against female contestants, as well as contestant comments. Another major source of controversy that has spanned multiple seasons has been the activities of contestants prior to competing on the show such as past recording contracts in contravention of the rules, and undisclosed criminal charges. Voting controversies Voting has been the biggest source of controversy with American Idol becoming embroiled in numerous controversies in various seasons over the voting process and its results. =Season one autodialer power-voting= Around 100 people using auto-dialing software and their home dial-up modems reportedly placed as many as 10,000 votes a night. However, FremantleMedia, which produces the show, contended that this represented a 'statistically insignificant' proportion of the overall voting, and Fox insisted that the system was fair. Nevertheless, concerns were raised about possible unfairness in the situation of a tight vote. One of the show's executive producers Ken Warwick later indicated that equipment was put in place afterwards to address this issue but it has not detected any such problem since its installation. =Season two finale vote= Out of 24 million votes recorded following the season two finale, Ruben Studdard finished just 130,000 votes ahead of Clay Aiken. There was confusion over the winning margin as Ryan Seacrest initially announced it as 13,000, later again 1,335, and then finally corrected by Fox as 130,000. There was much discussion in the communication industry about the phone system being overloaded, and that potentially more than 230 million calls were dropped just by AT&T; and SBC (over 30% of the market), making the results statistically invalid.Siebel, Deborah S., American Idol Outrage: Your Vote Doesn't Count, Broadcastingandcable.com, 2004-05-17, Retrieved on 2007-03-03. The phone lines may have been running at capacity that made a near-tie inevitable, with the winner potentially decided by text-messaging which was unaffected by capacity problem. In an interview prior to the start of the fifth season, executive producer Nigel Lythgoe revealed for the first time that Aiken had led the fan voting from the wild card week onward until the finale.Martin, Logan., \\"It's Going to be a Very Strong Season, I Think\\": An Interview with American Idol Producer Nigel Lythgoe , realitynewsonline.com, 2006-01-17, Retrieved on 2007-03-03. =Season two phone scam= During the second season, a phone scam operation based in Salt Lake City, Utah was discovered, in which people were tricked into believing that viewers could vote for their favorites through an 800 number, rather than the 866 number used on the show. =Season three Jennifer Hudson's ouster= At top seven, the three African American singers Fantasia Barrino, LaToya London, and Jennifer Hudson, dubbed the Three Divas, all unexpectedly landed at the bottom three. Jennifer Hudson was eliminated, prompting much discussion and criticism. Elton John, who was one of the mentors that season, called the results of the votes \\"incredibly racist\\"Elton John Says 'American Idol' Vote Is 'Racist', Reuters via Yahoo.com, 2004-04-28, Retrieved on March 2, 2007. (though Barrino went on to win the competition). Criticisms were also voiced about the voting system that resulted in survival of contestants such as John Stevens over Jennifer Hudson, or Jasmine Trias over LaToya London. It was claimed that Jasmine Trias' fans were able to vote early and often outside of the 2-hour voting window, and a disproportionate number of votes came from Jasmine Trias' home state of Hawaii. =Season four voting numbers mix-up= During the Top 11 performance show, three of the contestants had their numbers mixed up with the wrong numbers appearing on the screen, resulting in millions of votes being voided.Recordings of the performances were therefore reshown on the Wednesday show with new, live commentary from the three judges, and the audience revoted. The elimination night was moved to Thursday. =Season five Chris Daughtry's vote-off= In the week finalist Chris Daughtry was voted off, some voters claimed that phone calls dialed for Daughtry during the first few minutes of voting were misrouted to Katharine McPhee's lines, and they heard her recorded message thanking them for voting.MSNBC staff, Some callers claim ‚ÄòIdol‚Äô votes were misdirected, Today, 2006-05-12, Retrieved on 2007-03-03. Other voters claimed similar problems voting for other contestants, in some cases resulting in votes going to Daughtry that were intended for another contestant, Elliott Yamin.Elliott's votes going to Chris on DI, Dialidol.com forums, 2006-05-09, Retrieved on 2007-03-03. =Season six voting campaign for Sanjaya= This season saw a concerted attempt to influence the outcome of the vote in American Idol, led most notably by Howard Stern and Vote for the Worst. Howard Stern encouraged his listeners to vote for Sanjaya Malakar who had become a phenomenon in Season 6, and to take delight in possibly \\"ruining\\" Idol. =Season six Melinda Doolittle's vote-off= Melinda Doolittle's departure stunned fans and critics alike. Simon Cowell admitted that the sixth season's crown should have rightfully gone to Melinda. Executive producer Nigel Lythgoe responded, noting that \\"[Idol producers] were so engrossed with the mentors and didn't really focus on the Melinda Doolittles of the show.\\" Lythgoe also produces So You Think You Can Dance, and has noted that the dance program gives background information about its contestants, while American Idol focused more on its big-name celebrity mentors, such as Tony Bennett, Gwen Stefani, and Jennifer Lopez. =Season eight phone numbers= In the top thirteen in season 8, the expected phone number for finalist Alexis Grace, IDOLS-13, was not owned by American Idol, but by a company called Intimate Encounters, who used it as a sex line. Although host Ryan Seacrest made ample mention of the replacement phone number, IDOLS-36, some commentators feared that the phone number confusion could have led to Grace being inadvertently voted off the show. However, she was not voted off that week. =Season eight finale vote: \\"Textgate\\"= In May 2009, following allegations in the media of an American Idol texting scandal dubbed \\"Textgate\\", one of American Idol's corporate sponsors, AT&T;, admitted providing free mobile phones and texting services for fans of Kris Allen (who won the competition) at parties organized on the night of the program's final episode. Company representatives also provided Allen's supporters with lessons in how to send \\"power texts\\" which send ten or more votes with the touch of a single button. Bobby Kierna, one of the 2,000 guests who attended just one of the events, told reporters that she had voted for Allen 10,840 times. AT&T; denied attempting to \\"fix\\" the contest and apologized, saying that employees had been \\"caught up in their enthusiasm\\" and promised that they will in future \\"celebrate the competition, not individual contestants\\". While speculations were rife over the reasons for Allen's win over Adam Lambert, in a statement, Fox said that an independent monitor was employed to oversee the voting process to ensure the competition results were \\"fair, accurate and verified.\\" =Season nine Siobhan Magnus' vote-off= Siobhan Magnus's elimination caused a stir among the judges and fans of the show. The controversy grew when it was discovered that a phone number printed on Facebook was not a number to vote for Magnus, but to vote for Aaron Kelly.Siobhan Magnus wrong number led to vote off? Gather.com May 01, 2010 Some commentators speculated that the phone number mix-up may have led to Magnus's exit. An unsuccessful campaign to bring Magnus back into the show was started by her fans. = Gender and ethnic biases = American Idol faced criticism for implications of gender and ethnic bias in its finalists; for five consecutive seasons‚Äîseven through eleven‚Äîthe winner of American Idol was a guitar-playing, Caucasian male. The string of winners led to complaints by critics, who classified them as being a \\"white guy with guitar\\" (WGWG), and felt that the likely winner of the program had become too predictable due to the repeated victories by such performers. The first five contestants eliminated from the finals in the tenth season were all female, which led some critics to believe that it was partly due to the demographic of the voters being skewed towards females who tended to vote for men.With Pia Toscano now gone, can American Idol do anything about its woman problem? Retrieved March 30, 2013Sorry, ladies. 'Idol's' just not that into you Female hopefuls keep getting the boot, while guys who aren't as good stick around Idol producer Ken Warwick said, \\"It's no secret that most reality shows are female driven, either by moms or by young girls. It does mean we're going to get a heftier amount of female votes and it's always bent towards the boys, obviously, we are very much aware that the voting can be skewed towards the boys.\\" In response to the criticism, the producers considered tweaking the voting format for the following season to correct the bias. The last of these five girls to be eliminated was a presumed front-runner, Pia Toscano, and her elimination drew considerable criticisms, with various former Idol alums and celebrities such as Ashton Kutcher and Tom Hanks expressing shock and surprise. Prior to the eleventh-season finale, which saw the victory of the fifth \\"WGWG\\" winner Phillip Phillips, American Idol: The Untold Story author Richard Rushfield explained that the notions of attractiveness and personality of these contestants had influenced their victories, stating that \\"You have this alliance between young girls and grandmas and they see it, not necessarily as a contest to create a pop star competing on the contemporary radio, but as ... who's the nicest guy in a popularity contest,\\" and going on to say that these tactics had \\"led to this dynasty of four, and possibly now five, consecutive, affable, very nice, good-looking white boys.\\" =Season twelve Angie Miller vote-off= Angie Miller's elimination drew considerable criticisms. Miller was considered a fan-favorite, often placing in the voting's top ranks and becoming the season's sole contestant to not land in the bottom group until her elimination in the Top 3. The elimination was described by journalists as \\"shocking\\" and \\"surprising\\". = Season thirteen Malaya Watson vote-off = Malaya Watson's elimination caused stir amongst many fans with some stating that the judges use of the \\"Judges Save\\" on April 3, 2014 should have been used on her. Some said that Malaya deserved to win and others announced that they would no longer watch the show as they were outraged by her elimination. Judge Jennifer Lopez revealed in an interview that she was outraged and disappointed with the result and believed that Malaya did not deserve to be eliminated from the show; then added that she wished she could've done something about it.http://americanidolnet.com/jennifer-lopez-very-sad-over- malaya-watson-elimination-interview/ American Idol Season 11 runner-up Jessica Sanchez stated on Twitter her anger and disappointment with Malaya's elimination. Stating \\"Mad and disappointed about it Malaya should have been safe. #idoldisagree\\" http://americanidolnet.com/jessica-sanchez-mad-about- malaya-watson-elimination/ Dozens of American Idol reviewers also stated their disappointment and outrage with the result saying that Watson did not deserve to go home. Career control American Idol had come under fire for maintaining what some claim to be total control of the careers of the contestants that sign with their company, 19 Entertainment. The contract the contestants are required to sign gives Simon Fuller's company the right to oversee not just the recording deal for American Idol stars, but also control any merchandising, touring, sponsorship and movie deals. It also gives the producer the right to \\"record any and all behavior of the contestant \\"in and in connection with the series\\" and use the contestant's likeness, voice and any or all biographical material, whether true or false, any way they want to\\", and forbade the contestants to reveal anything about the show where any breaches of confidentiality can result in damages assumed to be in excess of $5 million. According to National Geographic Channel investigator and journalist Eric Olsen, 'Branding' is what Fuller is all about. Lucian Grainge, chairman and chief executive of Universal Music U.K. was quoted as saying: In his article, Olsen was critical of Fuller for the contract that his contestants must sign, where the finalists become essentially \\"forever and throughout the universe\\" properties of 19 Management. On July 29, 2009, Lyndsey Parker at Yahoo's \\"Reality Rocks\\" headlined \\"Ex-Idol Contestant Says Show Is Rigged,\\" reported that Ju'Not Joyner charged that, \\"It's a fixed thing if I ever saw one,\\" and that, after initial competitions, when winners reach a serious stage, a bad contract is offered, a \\"slavetract.\\" Joyner claimed that he was cut out of further competition at this late stage, because, \\"I have a son to feed. I HAD to ask questions and know what I was signing. Plus I write my own songs and I needed to know details\\" of what rights he'd be giving up. He charged that he was told, essentially, \\"Just shut up and sign,\\" or else he'd lose the next round. He speculated that perhaps the reason Kris Allen had beaten runner-up Adam Lambert was that the producers weren't satisfied with what Lambert had accepted. Contestants =Season one= * Delano Cagnolatti, a contestant who successfully made it through to the semi-finals, later revealed that he lied about his age to escape the cutoff date set in the rules. He was quickly disqualified and replaced by Ejay Day, thus becoming the first American Idol contestant to be disqualified. *Jim Verraros was the first openly gay contestant on the show. He was told by FOX to remove all gay comments from his online journal. Verraros later explained, \\"It wasn't because I was gay. It was because they thought I was trying to gain more votes and have that little extra edge.\\"Steele, Bruce C., A Teen Idol's dreams, The Advocate via Findarticles.com, 2003-01-21, Retrieved on 2007-03-03. =Season two= *Corey Clark was disqualified just nine hours after it was revealed on The Smoking Gun that he had undisclosed pending criminal charges. Later in 2005, first in Globe magazine, then in an hour-long ABC's Primetime special, as well as a book They Told Me to Tell the Truth, So ... (The Sex, Lies, and Paulatics of One of America's Idols), he claimed to have had an affair with Paula Abdul. He played a voicemail message from someone sounding like Abdul in which she said \\"if the press are trying to talk to you, say absolutely nothing.\\" He also claimed that Abdul helped him with his look and song selection so he could advance further in the competition. He further claimed that he was disqualified not for his criminal past, but rather for \\"making waves\\" by getting other contestants to insist on their own lawyer before they would sign their contract, a move that he asserted he had done following Abdul's advice. An investigation by external counsel later found that claims by Corey Clark \\"have not been substantiated by any corroborating evidence or witnesses, including those provided by Mr. Clark,\\" and cleared Paula Abdul.Fox investigation clears Paula Abdul of Corey Clark's 'Idol' charges, UPI via realitytvworld.com, 2005-08-12, Retrieved on 2007-03-03. Following the investigation, Idol enhanced its non-fraternization policy in their rules in order to prevent further controversies between contestants and those affiliated with the show. *Semi-finalist Jaered Andrews was also disqualified. It was later revealed that he was arrested on an assault charge, a charge he had previously disclosed to Idol, and that he was later acquitted of. *Semi- finalist Frenchie Davis was removed from the competition when topless photos of her surfaced on an adult website purportedly featuring underage content.\\"American Idol\\" Star Bounced, The Smoking Gun archive, Retrieved on 2007-03-03. =Season five= * Terrell and Derrell Brittenum were twins who were featured prominently on the auditions and successfully made it past the Hollywood rounds in Season 5, but were subsequently arrested for identity theft and disqualified.Starr, Michael., 'Idol' Twins Booted for Alleged ID Theft , Foxnews.com, 2006-01-27, Retrieved on 2007-03-03. * Mandisa was voted off following her performance of \\"Any Man of Mine\\" that she prefaced with a statement about being free from certain addiction and lifestyle that some interpreted as anti-gay.

It was reported that MCA spent over 2 million dollars promoting Smithson's previous album Ultimate High, which she made under the name Carly Hennessy. The album was claimed to have sold only 378 copies, but has since been made available on iTunes. Randy Jackson also worked for MCA as the senior vice president of A&R; during the same period of time that Smithson was signed. It has led to suggestions by some that she was placed there by the producers, perhaps to avoid having another Sanjaya Malakar, or to ensure a more professional and marketable artist wins. According to a poll conducted by AOL Television, 63 percent of those polled believed that contestants who have already had record deals should not be contestants on American Idol. *Other contestants, such as Robbie Carrico, also had prior record deals ‚Äì he had a minor hit in 2000 with the single \\"Messed Around\\", as well as opening for Britney Spears in 1999 as a member of Boyz N Girlz United. Others reported to have record deals included finalists Michael Johns and Kristy Lee Cook. *David Hernandez, one of the top 12 in Season 7, was revealed by Vote for the Worst to have worked as a male stripper in Phoenix, Arizona. According to the owner of Dick's Cabaret, Hernandez's job included a routine featuring full nudity and performing lap dances for male clientele. =Season eight= *Season 8 semifinalist Joanna Pacitti raised a lot of parallels to Carly Smithson when it was revealed that Pacitti had a prior record deal with A&M; Records. She had recorded a song used in the film Legally Blonde, \\"Out from Under\\"; a song that was featured on the soundtrack of the film Bratz, which was later re-recorded by Britney Spears; and a 2006 record deal after she changed to Geffen Records and released This Crazy Life. She made the semifinals for season eight; however, after it was alleged by Star Magazine that she may have connection with two executives of 19 Entertainment, Pacitti was disqualified from the show. She was then replaced by Felicia Barton, who did not make the Top 13. =Season nine= *Chris Golightly, who had originally been selected for the top 24, was disqualified on February 15, 2010 for being in a recording contract at the time of his original audition. Golightly later provided documentation indicating that his recording contract was no longer binding at the time of his original audition; however, this was disputed by his management who claimed he signed a new 2-year contract two months before his audition. He was replaced by Tim Urban. *Todrick Hall, a top 16 finalist who used to be a children's play director, came under fire on February 20, 2010 for charging several parents a $50 fee for auditioning for a musical called \\"Oz, the Musical\\". The musical got cancelled, but money charged for the auditions was never refunded. Hall, however, denied that he, being the director rather than the producer, was ever involved in the financial aspect of the production. Hall was ultimately eliminated before the top 12. =Season eleven= *Jermaine Jones, one of the top 12 of season 11, was disqualified on March 13, 2012, for failing to disclose past criminal charges to the Idol producers. Jones was charged with two crimes in 2011, one involving violence, and had 4 outstanding warrants since his arrests. Jones, however, denied that he had concealed his previous arrests, as he had admitted his arrests when he signed up for Idol. A police official in a New Jersey town where he is the target of two arrest warrants said that \\"the case wasn't big enough to merit going after him\\", and that for the show \\"to expose, embarrass and interrogate a young man without an attorney in front of 40 million viewers was an outrage\\". Critics suggested that the show may have staged the disqualification to boost ratings. Overtime broadcast During the season six and season seven finales, the show went over its scheduled 2-hour time limit and ended at 10:09 PM EST. Many DVR users claimed the recording ended before the new winners (Jordin Sparks and David Cook) were announced shortly after 10 PM. FOX executives apologized, and during the season eight Top 2 performance show, host Ryan Seacrest warned viewers that the finale would run overtime. On the April 7, 2009 performance episode of season eight, the show ended nearly eight minutes past its set ending time. This caused viewers who recorded the program to completely miss the show's final performance, Adam Lambert's performance of \\"Mad World\\" by Tears for Fears, which received a standing ovation from judge Simon Cowell. On the April 21, 2010 Idol Gives Back special, the show went over its scheduled 2-hour slot to 10:24 PM EST. Seacrest did warn viewers at the end of the previous night's performance show that the episode would run overtime. Due to this, Tim Urban, the contestant that was eliminated that night, did not get to sing his final song. Other controversies =Kelly Clarkson at 9/11 commemoration= Immediately after winning American Idol on September 4, 2002, Kelly Clarkson was arranged to sing \\"The Star-Spangled Banner\\" by her then management company, 19 Entertainment, at a special commemoration the following week for the first anniversary of September 11 attacks at the Lincoln Memorial. It drew criticisms that the producers of American Idol were turning a somber occasion of national mourning into a \\"giant promotional opportunity\\". Clarkson considered withdrawing from the commemoration, saying that \\"I think it is a bad idea. If anybody thinks I'm trying to market anything, well, that's awful\\" and added, \\"I am not going to do it.\\" However, she was unable to withdraw from the event. =Ruben Studdard's Flava Jersey= During the course of Season 2, Ruben Studdard became known for wearing 205 Flava jerseys representing his area code. Shortly after the end of the contest Studdard sued 205 Flava, Inc for $2 million for using his image for promotional purposes. Flava responded by alleging that Studdard had accepted over $10,000 in return for wearing 205 shirts, and produced eight cashed checks to validate their claim. The allegations, if true, were a clear violation of the American Idol rules.Paulsen, Wade., 205 Flava claims secret payoffs to 'American Idol' winner Ruben Studdard, realitytvword.com, 2003-08-06, Retrieved on 2007-03-02.

Cowell claims he was actually speaking to Paula Abdul and did not hear Richardson mention the tragedy. The next day, executive producer Nigel Lythgoe issued a statement about what really happened on the show,American Idol and on the results show that night, Cowell stated that he would never disrespect any of the victims. A screen clip was then shown depicting Cowell and Abdul talking with an inset of Richardson and Seacrest talking. The clip demonstrated that Cowell and Abdul did have a brief exchange as the contestant began his statement. However, neither Abdul nor Cowell were speaking at the mention of the words Virginia Tech and Cowell looked directly at Richardson as he completed his statement of support for the students. =Ryan Seacrest's results show spoiler= Prior to the March 17, 2010 results episode of the ninth season delayed airing on the west coast, Ryan Seacrest tweeted the outcome of the episode, which angered some fans. That episode of the show then suffered \\"the smallest audience among 18‚Äì49 year-olds for a regularly scheduled in-season episode in Idol history.\\" =Paula Abdul judges song before it's sung= For the season 7 Top 5 episode, originally aired April 29, 2008, the judging was modified in order to fit two songs per contestant into the show. Rather than judging each performance, the judges waited until each contestant had sung once, then were to give a quick critique of each contestants' first song. When the judging came to Paula, she commented on Jason Castro's first song, then proceeded to critique his second song that he had not yet sung. =Judges' critique in season ten= During the tenth season online critics from major news sources like Brian Mansfield of USA Today, Dalton Ross of Entertainment Weekly, Andrea Reiher of Zap2it, and Tom Gliatto of People Magazine criticized the judges for being too nice, not being honest enough, offering hardly any constructive criticism towards the contestants, and for not giving any guidance and direction for the viewers/voters in terms of why they should or should not be voting for someone. Executive producer Ken Warwick responded to these criticisms and said, \\"The truth of the matter is these kids are very good and I wouldn't influence the judges to say anything they don't absolutely believe ... They are trying to keep things on the straight and narrow. What they feel are genuine feelings, that's all I can ask them to do.\\" Nigel Lythgoe, another executive producer, also responded to these criticisms on his Twitter that \\"IT IS NOT ABOUT THE JUDGES OPINION IT'S ABOUT YOURS!! U R NOT SHEEP!\\" =Season ten Lee DeWyze finale involvement= Many fans of season nine winner, Lee DeWyze, were upset that he did not take part in the season ten finale like he was rumored to. Executive producer Nigel Lythgoe responded on his Twitter that he asked DeWyze to take part in the finale, but he declined, \\"I was so upset Lee DeWyze wouldn't present the winners trophy to Scotty,\\" he wrote. \\"Especially as he'd been on the show this Season. I guess he was shy.\\" However, DeWyze said that he was actually not asked to take part in the finale. \\"Just for the record ... I was not asked to be involved in the Finale. It wasn't until about 2 minutes before they announced that Nigel had approached me and asked if he could \\"borrow\\" me for a second. I didn't feel a last second jump on stage was appropriate. It was Scotty's moment. I appreciate American Idol, and the opportunity it has given me. And the people who have made that show possible. I am not angry, or bitter etc. It was an amazing Finale, and I would have loved to be a part of it. I just wasn't asked.\\" DeWyze was seen in the audience towards the end of the show. =Season eleven Jennifer Lopez music video= The music video of Jennifer Lopez's song, \\"Dance Again\\", which aired on the program, was criticized as inappropriate for younger viewers. Dan Gainor of the right-wing Culture and Media Institute wrote, \\"Even the supposedly family-friendly TV shows like American Idol are never safe in the hands of Hollywood,\\" and went as far as saying her \\"skanky new video shows how desperate she is to retain her fame despite her fading relevance. Such sexualized videos aren't appropriate for any children to watch, including Lopez's own twins.\\"Jennifer Lopez's 'Dance Again' Video Slammed By Right Wing Group (VIDEO)Jennifer Lopez's 'Dance Again' Video Stirs Controversy: Her Five Trashiest Videos Jenna Hally Rubenstein from MTV Buzzworthy also commented about the video's content not being appropriate for a family show, \\"we thought \\"Idol\\" was a family show?

The video showed Minaj yelling at Carey saying \\"I'm not going to put up with her fucking highness anymore.\\" According to Barbara Walters of The View, Carey claimed that Minaj had said: \\"If I had a gun, I would shoot the bitch,\\" a claim that Minaj then denied. Former judge Steven Tyler had said that he feels that the feud was a publicity stunt and nothing more. =Season thirteen Caleb Johnson comment = During his interview with AfterBuzz TV following the Top 5 elimination show, Caleb Johnson made offensive remarks about his fans who tweet him song suggestions. \\"[Twitter] gives access to a bunch of retards to talk to me,\\" Caleb said. \\"I don't really enjoy having to see somebody telling me what song I have to sing. I think at this point of the competition, I can pick and choose my own songs and represent me. I don't need 10,000 people saying, 'You should sing this, you should sing that. Listen to me!' Fortunately, guys, I'm going to listen to myself, whether you like it or not.\\" https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X0kaS90CBqA His comment has been described as \\"arrogant\\", with some fans turning against him. After his fans expressed outrage on Twitter, Caleb issued an apology on his Facebook page. \\"For the record that juvenile comment I made in the interview was not directed towards my fans but to the wackos that send hundreds of hate messages a day to me!

On the live airing of the Top 6 show, there were three contestants who had not been saved when Alexander was chosen. After he performed, host Ryan Seacrest noted that he appeared to be upset. When asked Alexander responded \\"This sucks, We've got two of the best vocalists, my best friend [Joey Cook] sitting over there. This whole thing is whack, but I'm going to shut up right now.\\" Seacrest then replied saying that this is a competition, and with the save anything could happen. When Alexander had left the stage, Connick Jr. said, \\"Quentin, if it's that whack, then you can always go home, because Idol is paying a lot of money to give you this experience and for you to say that to this hand that is feeding you right now, I think is highly disrespectful.\\" Alexander was then prompted by the producers to return to the stage where he approached the judges and clarified he meant the two being potentially eliminated was whack, not the show, or the experience. Later, after performing his second song, he explained \\"I understand that these things are going to happen, and I just didn't want my friend to leave\\" and apologized.http://www.ibtimes.com/american-idol-contestant-quentin-alexander- speaks-out-after-awkward-argument-harry-1885068 Judge Jennifer Lopez empathized with Alexander's emotions running high but said that as an artist he had to learn to work through that even when it happens to put on the performance. Joey Cook commented after being eliminated on Alexander's statements: > I pretty much just told him what he did was beautiful, in my opinion, and it > was the perfect representation of him. Quentin is a very emotional person. > He's very 'all cards on the table.' There is no sugar coating. He doesn't > hide his emotions. He's honest. He's a raw human being, and I think what > happened last night was the perfect example of that and how emotional of a > person he is.https://www.billboard.com/articles/news/6538526/american-idol- > joey-cook-quentin-alexander-wack-response American Idol played up the exchange in a promotional spot aired on the same channel and confirmed they will replay the incident at the beginning of the Top 5 show as part of the recap of the previous week. An AI source also stated that for fairness purposes the judges and contestants have a strict wall of silence between them and only interact onstage so Connick Jr. and Alexander have not had contact since last week. Alexander was eliminated the next show the following week with what Music Times questioned as possibly the first time American Idol \\"went into an episode with what seemed to be a very clear agenda.\\" References External links *Federal Trade Commission's American Idol case *American Idol Outrage: Your Vote Doesn't Count *Slaves of Celebrity Controversies Category:2000s controversies in the United States Category:2010s controversies in the United States Category:2000s in American television Category:2010s in American television Category:Mass media-related controversies in the United States Category:Television controversies in the United States Category:Criticism of television series ","title":"American Idol controversies"},{"id":"3886182","text":"Civitella Alfedena is a small town and comune in the province of L'Aquila (Abruzzo, central Italy).

Bailey came to prominence in the early 1980s as the lead vocalist for the new wave band Thompson Twins, which released five singles that entered the top ten charts in the United Kingdom during the 1980s: \\"Love On Your Side\\", \\"We Are Detective\\", \\"Hold Me Now\\", \\"Doctor! Doctor!\\", and \\"You Take Me Up\\". He was the only classic member of the band to have formal musical training. From 1994, Bailey was also a member of its later incarnation, Babble, releasing two commercially unsuccessful studio albums. He currently works in various musical fields including scoring for film. He records and performs dub music under the name International Observer and Indo-fusion music with the Holiwater Project. His latest collaboration is the Bailey-Salgado Project (BSP), an audiovisual ensemble formed with Jos√© Francisco Salgado. Early life and education Tom Bailey performing live on the Retro Futura Tour in 2014 Tom Bailey grew up in a family associated with the medical profession. His father was the Medical Officer of Health for Chesterfield Borough Council, and Bailey was educated at Chesterfield Boys' Grammar School. Despite training as a classical pianist, Bailey initially worked as a music teacher at Brook School, Sheffield. In his late teens and early twenties, he travelled the world. Musical career =1977‚Äì1993: Thompson Twins= Bailey formed the Thompson Twins in 1977 with Pete Dodd (guitar/vocals), John Roog (guitar), and Jon Podgorski (drums). Podgorski did not want to move to London, so Andrew Edge played drums with them for one year before Chris Bell joined. The group eventually ended up as a trio with Bailey on vocals, guitar, bass, and keyboards, his then girlfriend Alannah Currie (percussion, saxophone, and vocals), and Joe Leeway (percussion and vocals). The Thompson Twins became fixtures on MTV during the 1980s as the videos for \\"Hold Me Now\\", \\"Lay Your Hands on Me\\" and \\"King for a Day\\" were played frequently. Subsequent to the marriage of Bailey and Currie, Thompson Twins released their final album, Queer, in 1991. =1993‚Äì1996: Babble= In 1994, Bailey and Currie formed the electronica-orientated duo, Babble. =2000s: International Observer= Between 2001 and 2015, Tom Bailey released several dub/electronica albums under the name International Observer. =2010s: Tom Bailey Solo= Tom Bailey performed Thompson Twins songs live for the first time in 27 years on 17 August 2014 at Temple Island Meadows, Henley-On-Thames, Oxfordshire for the Rewind Festival. Also in 2014, Tom Bailey took part in the Retro Futura Tour in the USA. He was billed under the moniker \\"Thompson Twins' Tom Bailey.\\" The 2014 Retro Futura Tour also featured Howard Jones, Midge Ure, China Crisis, and Katrina Leskanich of Katrina and the Waves. During an interview with the Stuck in the '80s podcast prior to the tour, Tom Bailey said that while preparing for his return to the stage he went to a store and bought a Thompson Twins greatest-hits CD to help him learn the songs again. In 2016, Tom Bailey released a new solo single entitled \\"Come So Far\\", which included a music video. On 25 April 2017 the official Thompson Twins' Tom Bailey website announced that Bailey was recording his debut solo album and that he hoped to release the album in early 2018. The album, entitled Science Fiction, was released in July 2018. To promote the album, Bailey toured the United States and United Kingdom with The B-52s, Culture Club, and Belinda Carlisle as part of The Life Tour. =Musical collaborations= In 1988 Bailey collaborated with Phil Thornalley, who worked frequently with the Thompson Twins, on Thornalley's only solo album, Swamp. Aside from playing instruments, Bailey also produced three tracks, remixed three tracks along with Thornalley and co-wrote the track \\"When I Get to Heaven\\". In 1999 Bailey produced the New Zealand band Stellar, and in 1999 he won Record Producer of the Year in New Zealand for their debut album, Mix. In 2002 Bailey became the figurehead for the dub project International Observer. Recent performances with 'Holiwater', a cinematic fusion of Indian classical music (Sarod- Vikash Maharaj), electronica (keyboards ‚Äì Bailey) and video (film maker ‚Äì Andrei Jewell), blur boundaries between art installation and performance. The band was formed to highlight issues of water pollution on the Ganges. In 2010 Bailey and astronomer and visual artist Jos√© Francisco Salgado formed an audiovisual ensemble called Bailey-Salgado Project (BSP). BSP combines music with photography, video, and motion graphics to create multimedia works that have as subject the physical world. Their first work together, a short film entitled Sidereal Motion, was previewed in Bath, England in October 2010. Personal life Tom was married to fellow band member Alannah Currie from 1991 to 2003. They have two children, Jackson (b. 1987) and Indie (b. 1992). As of 2014, Bailey lived in France with his second wife, artist Lauren Drescher. He has homes in New Zealand, France, and London. Bailey has been vocal about his choice to be a vegan, and he does not drink or use recreational drugs. Discography =Solo albums= *Science Fiction (2018) =with Thompson Twins= *A Product of ...

The Scouts of the Saint-Georges and Caleb groups have helped over 2000 to reach the borders of the Dominican Republic in their personal cars so that the wounded may be treated. Through local committees, the two groups have been able to provide many with food and shelter in their own homes. The Scouts of the Gideon de Carrefour group have pulled out about 300 cadavers from under the debris and saved about 725, have fabricated coffins for the dozen Scouts who died, and they have dug a communal trench to bury 150 of the dead.

Fenton and Tom Svrcek. Its headquarters were first located in Chicago's Near North Side,\\"contact us.\\" Indigo Airlines. November 9, 2000. Retrieved on September 1, 2009. and later at Chicago Midway Airport.\\"Contact Us.\\" Indigo Airlines. February 11, 2003. Retrieved on September 1, 2009. History It was the first airline to allow individual travelers to reserve and purchase a single seat on a traditional corporate or business jet, which then flew a \\"scheduled\\" flight like a traditional airline. Prior to Indigo the only business-jet service available to consumers consisted of jet ownership or charter, both expensive alternatives to regular airline travel. The company was the originator of two new categories of corporate jet air travel service: per seat, high frequency and the public or commercial corporate jet. Indigo priced its service between its first city pair Chicago and New York City close to a so-called unrestricted coach class fare. The venture was backed by the American Express Corporation, which owned approximately 12% of Indigo's capital structure. Former American Express CEO Harvey Golub, now Chairman of Sentient Jet, led the Indigo investment and marketing agreement. Indigo's inventory was marketed and sold through American Express' Travel Related Services group and through its Platinum Card program. Indigo was the first business jet airline to list its seat inventory in the computer reservations systems Sabre and Apollo, using the carrier code \\"I9\\". The Indigo project was also supported by management consultants McKinsey & Company, and was advised by corporate identity firm Interbrand (an Omnicom company), public accountants and business advisors Arthur Anderson, public relations firm The Dilenschneider Group and investment bank and financial advisory firm Merrill Lynch & Company. =Fleet= Indigo's initial fleet consisted of four French- built Dassault Falcon jets, fitted with leather seats, a galley, private bathroom and laptop power outlets. Indigo was headquartered in Chicago, Illinois at Chicago Midway International Airport in the former Ameritech corporate hangar facilities. This was a co-located hangar, office complex, private passenger terminal and maintenance facility. Indigo was a vertically integrated aviation company and owned, employed and controlled its own aircraft fleet, pilots, dispatchers and maintenance services. The company operated as a Federal Aviation Administration FAR Part 135 commercial operator, and was certified by the United States Department of Transportation under Parts 41101 and 380 as a public charter operator. Indigo was the first business jet commercial operator to receive an additional DOT fitness approval and was granted a Certificate of Public Convenience and Necessity. In its initial operations the company distributed a request for proposal to several aerospace manufacturers for a new regional business jet to eventually replace its initial aircraft. The Brazilian Embraer Legacy was a customized business jet version of the Embraer regional airline aircraft. Indigo was the first U.S. certified commercial operator of the Legacy and launched service with the then new stage 4 aircraft in 2003 in a 16-seat all business-class service. Former senior American Airlines executive and American Eagle President Peter Pappas was hired as manager, during the transition to broader regional jet service. Pappas, while at American, was responsible for the introduction of the Embraer regional jet in the American Eagle division. =Opposition to use of Teterboro Airport= Congressman Steven Rothman of New Jersey (D-NJ9) felt that Indigo represented unwelcome expansion at New Jersey's Teterboro Airport. Other parties including Senator Jon Corzine (D-NJ) and Senator Frank Lautenberg (D-NJ) proposed to Department of Transportation Secretary Norman Mineta that Indigo's public charter flights required certain security services of the Teterboro Airport, part of a group of New York City metro airports operated by the Port Authority of New York and New Jersey, which it was not equipped to provide. The issue of multi-airport proprietor rules was also raised by the Congressmen. Following involvement by Admiral James Loy, Transportation Security Administration (TSA) Administrator, legislation was subsequently signed by President Bush as part of an FAA Reauthorization Bill. Indigo and American Express management, as well as FAA administration, argued that Indigo's use of Teterboro was appropriate and preferable to local alternatives such as LaGuardia Airport or Newark Liberty International Airport which were designed and configured for large airline aircraft and to prohibit the company from accessing the airport was an unfair discrimination under federal airport funding criteria. By September 2003, Indigo halted all flights in and out of Teterboro Airport.\\"Indigo Airlines drops Teterboro flights.\\" USA Today. June 4, 2003. Retrieved May 9, 2008. =Competition= By 2004, Indigo had voluntarily idled its operations after difficulties in securing additional capitalization. In 2005 the Netjets company, backed by Warren Buffett's Berkshire Hathaway, announced its intention to begin scheduled business jet service between Chicago, New York and Los Angeles. Other companies entering the market include Geneva, Switzerland based Club Airways, started by World Economic Forum founders the Schwab family. Other notable ventures operating similar \\"per seat\\" inventory, distribution and pricing include the Dayjet company, Linear Air and various jet membership programs offering \\"shared per seat charter\\" services. Several North Atlantic services also directly applied the concept of a commercial corporate jet but in larger traditional airline aircraft and included MAXjet, Fly First Class, Eos and Silverjet. In 2008, a company called Greenjets began non-scheduled per-seat or shared-ride private jet service between major eastern US metropolitan markets. Greenjets, unlike Indigo, does not own or operate aircraft, but utilizes the jet charter fleet in the US.

In 2001 it registered with the Office of the Scottish Charity Regulator. In 2003 the society commissioned a crown for the Lord Lyon King of Arms at the cost of around ¬£10,000, to replace the crown that was last seen in the 17th century. The next year the society assisted United States Secretary of State Colin Powell when he sought to register a coat of arms to mark his Scottish ancestry. The Society also participated, in conjunction with the Scottish Genealogy Society, in the planning of the XXVIIth International Congress of Genealogical and Heraldic Sciences which was convened in St Andrews in August 2006. In 2008, the chairman of the society commented on the coat of arms used by Donald Trump, noting that it broke several conventions. Office holders , the Society's President is John Malden and patron is Malcolm Innes of Edingight. The Heraldic painter Romilly Squire of Rubislaw was chairman for two terms 2002‚Äì2008.

His father, Virgil, was a physician and researcher on the faculty of Vanderbilt University School of Medicine. His mother, Louise, was a painter, art teacher, and writer. The young LeQuire showed an early interest in sculpture. While an undergraduate at Vanderbilt University, he studied independently under professor of sculpture Puryear Mims and Middle Tennessee State University sculptor Jim Gibson. He spent his senior year in France, studied art history, and earned a degree in English. After a year in Rome learning bronze casting as an assistant to New York City artist Milton Hebald, LeQuire entered the University of North Carolina at Greensboro, where he earned a Master of Fine Arts degree. Career LeQuire specializes in work of great scale, usually large public commissions. His most famous work is the replica of Phidias' Athena Parthenos that stands in the naos of the full-scale reconstruction of the Acropolis Parthenon in Nashville's Centennial Park. This statue, cast in a composite of gypsum and fiberglass on a steel and aluminum armature, is currently the largest piece of indoor sculpture in the Western World, standing almost 42 feet (13 m) tall. LeQuire received the commission for the work in 1982, and it was unveiled in 1990 in a stark, white finish. In 2002, LeQuire oversaw a polychroming and gilding process that brought the statue to an appearance close to what ancient Greek visitors may have seen at the original Parthenon. In 1997 LeQuire created a sculptural group of life- size portraits of Tennessee women's suffrage activists Elizabeth Avery Meriwether, Anne Dallas Dudley, and Lizzie Crozier French. The sculpture is on display in Market Square in downtown Knoxville, Tennessee and is known as the Tennessee Woman Suffrage Memorial. LeQuire also created a large bronze relief for the Tennessee State Capitol in Nashville dedicated to the Women's Rights Movement and commemorating passage of the Nineteenth Amendment to the U.S. Constitution in 1920‚ÄîTennessee was the 36th state to ratify the Nineteenth Amendment, thus making it part of the U.S. Constitution. Another large-scale work is Musica, a bronze statue grouping unveiled in 2003 that sits in a grassy knoll at the center of Buddy Killen Circle, a roundabout where Division Street meets 17th Avenue South in the Music Row area of Nashville. Musica is over tall, and consists of nine colossal nude figures, male and female, dancing in a circle. It is the largest bronze figure group in the United States. LeQuire is also a portrait sculptor. Other works by LeQuire include: * Life-size bronze sculptures at Blair School of Music and near Kirkland Hall at Vanderbilt University. * A heroic bronze of Timothy Demonbreun, French fur trapper and an early Nashville inhabitant, was completed in 1996 and now stands on the west bank of the Cumberland River. * Tennessee's Vietnam Veteran's Memorial, a well-composed grouping of three figures in action, is located on War Memorial Plaza, the building the houses the Tennessee General Assembly. * 24 bronze reliefs of Tennessee scenes and wildlife are displayed on the exterior doors of the downtown Nashville Public Library, designed by architect Robert Stern. LeQuire also has two portrait busts in the library's Grand Reading Room. * A life-size statue of Jack Daniel, located at the distillery in Lynchburg, TN. * A monument in Centennial Park in Nashville, featuring depictions of Carrie Chapman Catt, Anne Dallas Dudley, Abby Crawford Milton, Juno Frankie Pierce, and Sue Shelton White. * Statue of Sam Davis LeQuire was a Tennessee Arts Commission Fellow in 1986, and received a Tennessee Governor's Citation in 1987. In 1990 he was awarded an American Institute of Architects Design Award for Athena Parthenos.

The former governor, Pierre Fran√ßois de Rigaud, Marquis de Vaudreuil-Cavagnal, was promoted to the post of Governor of New France. Kerl√©rec was a minor aristocrat from Quimper, Finist√®re. In the late 1750s, during the Seven Years' War, he got into conflict with other officials and had three men recalled to France. They ultimately secured the support of the government, which recalled Kerl√©rec in 1763 and exiled him from Paris for a year. He was exonerated and remained in Paris for his last years. Colonial career Kerl√©rec had to struggle in greater than usual isolation during his administration, as the French government was immersed in conducting the Seven Years' War (1756 to 1763) in Europe. This added to the difficulties of communication by ship, where travel took weeks. In addition, the government was conducting the war in North America, where it was known as the French and Indian War, and struggling to maintain its alliances with certain Indian tribes against the British. Kerl√©rec took precautions to defend the small French colony from a possible British attack by erecting a palisade around New Orleans, rebuilding the battery at English Turn on the Mississippi River, and anchoring an old ship at the mouth of the river at the Gulf Coast. It could be sunk to prevent entry by English ships. However, Kerl√©rec's request for more troops went unanswered. Kerl√©rec tightened his discipline over the troops already stationed in the colony. During his governorship, relations between the Jesuit and the Capuchin orders in the colony were strained, and the local Indian tribes threatened to switch allegiances to the British if they were not provided with more supplies and trade goods. Kerl√©rec tried to hire Swiss mercenaries for defense, but the Commissary-Commissioner, Vincent de Rochemore, refused to pay for them. This was one of several public disagreements which they had. After a few years of not receiving communications or supplies from France, the colony learned that France had ceded Louisiana to the Spanish as a result of the French and Indian War, and to avoid being forced to give up control to Great Britain, which had defeated France. Kerl√©rec and Rochemore had many public quarrels; the latter accused Kerlerec of stealing money from the colony's treasury and acting as a dictator. Kerl√©rec ordered Rochemore and two allies (treasurer and comptroller Jean Baptiste d'Estrehan and Antoine Philippe de Marigny) recalled to France, but they succeeded in turning the government against him. Kerl√©rec was recalled to France and thrown into prison in 1763. He was exiled from Paris in 1769 but was exonerated a year later. Kerl√©rec then returned to Paris where he died in 1770. Legacy *A street in New Orleans' 7th Ward is named for Kerl√©rec. It goes from Chartres Street in the Faubourg Marigny neighborhood, north to Dorgenois Street. Due to developments over the years, the road is \\"broken\\" and does not run straight through its original course. References *Davis, Edwin Adams. Louisiana the Pelican State.

The A6 dual carriageway skirts the east of the district. Historically in Lancashire, Pendleton experienced rapid urbanisation during the Industrial Revolution. Pendleton is a densely populated area which has several high-rise blocks of flats, some of the tallest buildings in Salford. History The township has been variously recorded as Penelton in 1199, Pennelton in 1212, Penilton in 1236, Penhulton in 1331, Penulton in 1356 and Pendleton from about 1600. In the Middle Ages the manor was held by the Hultons of Hulton Park. Until 1780, Pendleton was rural, a group of cottages around a village green with a maypole. The Industrial Revolution brought about rapid expansion in the population and large cotton mills and premises for dyeing, printing, and bleaching were built providing employment. Pendleton Colliery was developed from the early 19th century. Violence and looting occurred in Pendleton during the 2011 riots. In 2012, Salford City Council announced a ¬£430million regeneration scheme for the area. Governance Pendleton emerged as a township and chapelry in the ecclesiastical parish of Eccles in the hundred of Salford in the historic county of Lancashire. After 1837 Pendleton was part of the Salford Poor Law Union which took responsibility for the administration of the Poor Law and provided a workhouse. In 1844 the neighbouring township of Salford was incorporated as a borough. However owing to opposition from Pendleton rate payers who felt that their interests would be over-ruled by Salford, it was not until 1853 that Pendleton and neighbouring Broughton who had also refused to merge with Salford became incorporated into an enlarged Borough of Salford. This was owing to increasing concerns to improve the sanitary conditions of the two townships which would have otherwise resulted in the creation of Local Boards of Health.The Godfrey Edition - Old Ordnance Survey Maps; Salford (West), Lancashire Sheet 104.5 Pendleton together with Broughton thus became part of the County Borough of Salford from its inception in 1889, thus for the purposes of local government being independent from the jurisdictions of the newly formed Lancashire County Council. Pendleton became part of the City and County Borough of Salford in 1926 and in 1974 became part of the much enlarged metropolitan borough of the City of Salford, in the metropolitan county of Greater Manchester. Pendleton is mostly covered by the electoral ward of Langworthy. It is represented in Westminster by Rebecca Long-Bailey MP for Salford and Eccles. The ward is represented on Salford City Council by three Labour councillors: John Warmisham, Gina Reynolds, and Paul Longshaw. Geography Pendleton is 2¬Ω miles north west of Manchester city centre by the River Irwell and at the junction roads to Liverpool, Preston, Bolton and Manchester. The Manchester, Bolton & Bury Canal, the Liverpool and Manchester and Manchester and Bolton railways pass through the area. Pendleton is on the Manchester Coalfield, part of Lancashire Coalfield. In the early days of coal mining seams lying on or close to the surface were exploited, but as time went by deeper shafts were sunk to exploit deeper coal seams, so that by the beginning of the 20th century Pendleton Colliery had the deepest shafts in Great Britain, at . The area gives its name to the geological feature known as the Pendleton Fault, one of four large faults running under the Manchester area. The faults are geologically active, and cause earthquake tremors that have been recorded for centuries, most recently in August 2007, when Manchester experienced six minor earthquakes. Clarendon Park is within the bounds of Pendleton. The largest public park is Buile Hill Park which lies on high ground adjacent to Eccles Old Road. Transport Pendleton railway station closed in 1998 after it was damaged in an arson attack. Salford Crescent railway station links the district and the University of Salford, central Manchester stations (Piccadilly, Oxford Road and Victoria) and towns in North West England and Scotland.

A right-handed relief pitcher who also batted right-handed, Belinda is tall and weighs 187 pounds. He pitched from a three-quarters arm slot (sometimes categorized as a \\"sidearm\\" delivery) and threw both a regular low-90s fastball and a split-fingered fastball. Baseball career =Pittsburgh Pirates= As an amateur, Belinda pitched at State College Area High School and Allegany College of Maryland.Stan Belinda, The Baseball Cube. Accessed November 3, 2007. In , the Pittsburgh Pirates selected him in the 10th round of the June draft, the 238th pick overall. He made his professional debut in the Gulf Coast League and advanced steadily through the minors, making his major league debut with the Pirates on September 8, 1989. From ‚Äì, Belinda was a key reliever for the Pirates, setting up for Bill Landrum in the first two years before being promoted to closer in 1992. He is most well known in Pittsburgh for giving up the hit to Francisco Cabrera that scored Sid Bream and lost the NLCS for Pittsburgh in the bottom of the ninth inning in Game 7 against the Atlanta Braves. 1992 National League Championship Series The Pirates were one of the dominant teams in the National League at that time, winning the East division three consecutive years from 1990-1992, but they ultimately proved unable to advance to the World Series. In Game 7 of the NLCS, Belinda came out of the bullpen in the ninth inning, trying to protect a 2‚Äì0 Pittsburgh lead with three men on base and nobody out. Belinda induced Ron Gant to fly out, scoring one run, then walked Damon Berryhill and retired Brian Hunter on a popup. Then, with reserve Francisco Cabrera at the plate, Belinda surrendered a game-winning single, with slow-footed Sid Bream barely beating the throw from left fielder Barry Bonds to score the winning run from second base. =Kansas City Royals and Boston Red Sox= Belinda was the subject of intense criticism in Pittsburgh after the loss, although his overall performance in the playoffs had been very good, and the loss of Bonds in free agency that offseason ended the team's days as a contender. The Pirates entered a rebuilding mode, and on July 31, 1993, they traded Belinda to the Kansas City Royals for pitchers Jon Lieber and Dan Miceli. While with the Royals, Belinda pulled off an 'immaculate inning', striking out the side on 9 pitches. He is the last Royals pitcher to achieve this feat. Arm problems plagued Belinda during his year and a half with the Royals, and he left the team as a free agent, signing with the Boston Red Sox shortly before the 1995 season. Temporarily healthy once more, Belinda enjoyed a great season in 1995, picking up eight wins and 10 saves as the primary setup man for Rick Aguilera. Boston won the American League's East division that year, but was swept in three games by the Cleveland Indians in the ALDS. Belinda's arm troubles resurfaced in , and he was largely ineffective, walking more batters than he struck out and pitching only 28 innings. =Cincinnati Reds= Belinda signed with the Cincinnati Reds that offseason, and improbably went on to enjoy the best season of his career, delivering 99 innings of quality pitching. His 84 games pitched ranked second in the league, and his 114 strikeouts led all relief pitchers in baseball. He began to suffer from tingling and numbness in his legs the following season, and on September 22, 1998, the Mayo Clinic issued a diagnosis of multiple sclerosis. =Colorado Rockies and Atlanta Braves= Daily injections of the drug Copaxone and changes to his diet and lifestyle enabled Belinda to keep pitching professionally for a time, but his performance suffered. He spent as a mop-up pitcher for the Reds, and on October 30 of that year, he and outfielder Jeffrey Hammonds were traded to the Colorado Rockies for outfielder Dante Bichette. Belinda put up a 7.07 ERA with the Rockies in , before being released in July. He signed with the Atlanta Braves but was released again on September 12, ending his professional career. He retired with 41 wins, 37 losses, and 79 saves, putting up a 4.15 ERA in 685 career innings. =Personal life = Belinda is currently suffering from multiple sclerosis, also known as MS.

Godless tells the story of Jason Bock, a fifteen-year-old boy, who questions his father's Catholic religion. Jason invents his own religion, \\"Chutengodianism\\". Jason and his fellow \\"Chutengodians\\" worship the water tower, dubbed Ten-Legged One. While Jason does not really believe the Ten- Legged One is God, his friend, Shin, does. Jason does not see the consequences of his seemingly obvious jest. Godless sparks religious controversy as many parents question the motivation behind the story. Pete Hautman responds to this controversy on his webpage.http://www.petehautman.com/godless.html  Plot summary Frustrated with his parents' Catholic religion, agnostic-going- on-atheist Jason Bock invents a new god‚Äîthe water tower. He recruits an unlikely group of worshippers, including: his snail farming best friend, Shin; incredibly ordinary Dan Grant; cute-as-a-button Magda Price; and violent, unpredictable Henry Stagg. As the Chutengodian religion grows, it takes on a life of its own. While Jason struggles to keep the faith pure, Shin obsesses over writing their bible as Henry schemes to make the faith even more exciting‚Äîand dangerous. As a result, when the Chutengodians hold their first mass atop the dome of the water tower, things go from dangerous to deadly. Characters =Main= Jason Bock is a large, 15-year-old boy from St. Andrew Valley. Fed up with Catholicism, he invents his own religion, Chutengodianism, worshipping the town water tower. His father forces him to attend weekly Teen Power Outreach meetings, which Jason refers to as brainwashing sessions. He enjoys messing with Just Al, the \\"head brainwasher,\\". His best friend, Shin, is a snail farmer. Jason has uncertain feelings for Magda Price. He does not much care for the infamous Henry Stagg and his \\"three stooges.\\" At first, Chutengodianism seems to be going great. As things progress, Founder and Head Kahuna, Jason, must try to hold his religion together while it decomposes. Shin (real name: Peter Stephen Schinner) is Jason's best friend and First Keeper of the Sacred Text of Chutengodianism. As a hobby, he farms snails. Shin is Jason's first follower. Unlike the other Chutengodians, Shin takes the religion seriously, believing the water tower is speaking to him. His belief is so deep that he sneaks out during a midnight thunderstorm to climb the water tower, seeking some sort of enlightenment. Jason cannot convince Shin to come back down. Shin wants to swim in the godhead, like the others had done at the first mass. Dan Grant is Jason's ordinary friend. He is so average that one has to meet him several times before remembering his name. He is a preacher's son and the second acolyte of the \\"Ten-Legged One\\". After the fiasco at the water tower, Dan holds a grudge against Jason for getting him in trouble and messing up his life. Magda Price is a pretty girl who works at Wigglesworth. The third member of the new religion, she joins after overhearing Jason and Shin talking about their new church. They originally disapprove of her joining, but later agree that Chutengodians should not discriminate based on gender. Magda's relationship with Henry Stagg evolves throughout the book. Magda allegedly helps Henry create his commandments for the \\"Choots\\", an offshoot of Chutengodianism. Henry Stagg is the last to join the Chutengodians. Not caring what happens to him or others, Henry is somewhat of a bully to Jason and Shin. He will not hurt innocent victims, but will pick on any able bodied person. He has a collection of Velociraptors in his garage, which he cherishes. He breaks from the Church of the Ten-Legged One, forming the \\"Choots\\" with his friends, Mitch Cosmo, Marsh Andrews, and Bobby. =Minor= Mr. Bock is Jason's devout Catholic father. Bothered by Jason's disbelief in God, he forces him to attend Teen Power Outreach. For most of the story, he disapproves of Jason's new religion, only to accept it at the end of the novel. After the Chutengodians' ill-fated meeting on top of the water tower, Mr. Bock instructs Jason to write book reports on five Catholic books. Mrs. Bock is Jason's mother. Obsessed with a medical book (which Jason says she reads like the Bible), she loves to diagnose her son with extremely rare conditions. Throughout the story, she worries that Jason has some sort of sleep condition, although he insists that he just likes to sleep. Father Haynes is the priest at the local Catholic church. Jason finds his sermons and church services boring. Just Al is the leader of the TPO meetings. Jason refers to him as a \\"car salesman\\" with the ability to change the subject to whatever he wants. Jason often finds ways of annoying Al or disrupting the meetings in some way. Al usually responds by changing the subject or giving a small speech about faith and God. He is known for his unique prayers, which typically state something about Jesus being \\"one cool dude\\". The Three Goons, Mitch Cosmo, Marsh Andrews, and Bobby, are Henry Stagg's juvenile delinquents who follow him around and do whatever he tells them to do. Themes The teenagers represent the colonization of childhood by adults. Jason and Shin are contrasts in how religion is approached by teens; Jason questions the authority of religion, while Shin accepts it.

Although combined stations and hotels were common in the United Kingdom in the late 19th century, Place Viger was the only such combination in Canada. Place Viger was designed by Bruce Price for the Canadian Pacific Railway, and was built near what was then the central core of Montreal, in proximity to the financial district, the city hall, the port and the court house. The mayor of Montreal, Raymond Pr√©fontaine, strongly encouraged its construction in an area central to the French Canadian √©lites, in contrast to the rival Windsor Hotel to the west, which was perceived to cater to the city's anglophone classes. The rail station served as the terminus of the CP passenger rail lines running into downtown Montreal from the north and east. It replaced the older Dalhousie Station. Its counterpart terminus for CP passenger rail lines running into downtown Montreal from the south and west was Windsor Station. Constructed in the French ch√¢teau-style common to railway hotels built by Canadian Pacific, Place Viger housed the railway station in its lower levels and a luxurious hotel on the upper floors. Place Viger enjoyed an enviable setting adjacent to the gardens of Viger Square, allowing both railway travellers and hotel guests to stroll along the garden paths. The shifting of Montreal's commercial core to the north-west, and the onset of the economic depression of the 1930s, proved disastrous for Place Viger. The hotel closed in 1935. In 1951, the railway station was also closed, and the building was sold to the City of Montreal. The interiors were gutted and transformed into nondescript office space, and the building was renamed √âdifice Jacques- Viger. Place Viger, The Viger Square gardens were destroyed in the 1970s to allow for the construction of the Autoroute Ville-Marie highway. After the highway was completed, although a new Viger Square was created on the concrete deck covering the highway, it was poorly designed, desolate and underused, despite sculptural works by artists including Charles Daudelin. For decades, the old Place Viger station sat isolated and neglected, a striking historic building surrounded by parking lots and concrete.

Born in Speyer, Julian studied at the University of Paris and was the musical director for the royal chapel during the reigns of Philip Augustus and Louis VIII of France. Eventually, he left to become a member of the newly founded Order of St Francis, but exactly when is not known. In 1227, Julian accompanied Brother Simon Angelicus to Germany, when he was made Provincial of Germany by the General Chapter of Assisi. It is probable that he was present at the translation of St. Francis at Assisi in May 1230. Afterwards, he lived in Paris again at the great convent of the Minorites, where he was choir- master as well as corrector mensae (who oversees the reading in the refectory). Although in the Middle Ages, Julian of Speyer was held in high respect as a composer and writer of rhymed offices, he was almost forgotten until the end of the nineteenth century. It is certain that he composed the rhymed Office (historia) of St. Francis of Assisi (written between 23 February 1229 and 4 October 1235), as well as that of St. Anthony of Padua, who was canonized on 30 May 1232 (composed just after 1241). Both these musical, as well as poetical, masterpieces are still used by the Franciscans. These works are distinguished for the harmony, rhythm, and rhyme of the verses, and for their sublime expressiveness as musical compositions. Only a few sentences in the third nocturn (the antiphons) were written by Pope Gregory IX and the cardinals; the rest is entirely Julian's composition. Even outside the Franciscan Order the rhythmic structure has often been copied, with whole verses being frequently taken (especially from the Historia rhythmica of St. Francis) and set to Julian's melodies without any changes. It is not known how much of the poetic narrative of St. Dominic (d. 1221), used on his feast by both Franciscans and Dominicans, belongs to Julian of Speyer. Some portions at least of the mass formula of Sts. Francis and Anthony are undoubtedly his musical and poetical compositions. Only in the turn of the century was Julian recognized as the author of the Legenda S. Francisci and of the Vita ab auctore anonymo of St Anthony of Padua.

He is best known for having hosted the children's programs The BJ and Dirty Dragon Show and Gigglesnort Hotel. Early life and career Jackson was born in Unionville, Missouri. His father worked with a traveling carnival. He said he was very influenced by both comic strips and comic books, with Li'l Abner and Donald Duck being his favorites. Jackson graduated from the University of Missouri's school of journalism with a degree in television production in 1957, but did not get interested in puppetry until later. His first broadcasting job was at KTVO in Ottumwa, Iowa, where he was a weatherman, copywriter and the station's art director. After a year at the station, Jackson joined the army and was assigned to Armed Forces Network in Hollywood. It was here where he created his first puppets. His earliest appearance in children's television was in 1960 when he hosted a program in Fort Wayne, Indiana, called the Popeye and Little Rascals Club; this was broadcast for two years (Bill Jackson). The show was such a success that he moved on to Indianapolis for another three years (Bill Jackson) with the Mickey Mouse Club on WLWI (now WTHR), later renamed The Bill Jackson Show, where he created his most enduring character, Dirty Dragon, based on a friend in Indianapolis. Jackson said \\"Cartoon Town\\" was based on the small town he grew up in and some of his puppet characters were based on some of his Unionville neighbors, and that the character \\"Weird\\" was based on a Chicago friend. His work attracted the attention of WBBM-TV in Chicago, which gave him a program in 1965, known variously as Clown Alley (weekday version) or Here Comes Freckles (Sunday morning version). Unfortunately, in spite of wide critical praise, the show drew poor ratings largely because it was broadcast early in the morning, and was cancelled after two seasons. Jackson played the title character, Freckles the Clown; although many of the puppet characters continued to appear on later series, Jackson usually played himself (or \\"B.J.\\", as his puppet co-stars called him) throughout the remainder of his career. Chicago Jackson's work did not go unnoticed, however, and he was hired by another Chicago station, the then-independent WFLD, which was looking for a show to go opposite WGN-TV's highly popular Garfield Goose and Friends. Jackson, a gifted artist, comedian and puppeteer, responded in 1968 with a program initially called Cartoon Town, but later renamed The BJ and Dirty Dragon Show. It was here that Jackson, playing the mayor of the cartoon town, reached great heights with characters such as Dirty Dragon, \\"Weird\\" and \\"Wally Goodscout\\", \\"Mother Plumtree\\", the \\"Old Professor\\", and a town monument called \\"Blob\\" (no relation to the movie) who was made of clay and could, with Jackson's help, assume any form. Jackson wrote and produced the show, performed all of the puppet characters' voices, built and designed the sets and puppets. The show featured a variety of cartoons, including Underdog, Popeye (the early 1960s made-for-TV King Features version), \\"Out Of The Inkwell\\" (the made-for-TV version produced by Hal Seeger) and George Of The Jungle. The show was broadcast for five years on WFLD, but ended after the station's owner, Field Communications, sold an interest to Kaiser Broadcasting, and Kaiser streamlined local productions on its group of stations. The final WFLD episode (#1311) was broadcast July 27, 1973; one month later, The BJ & Dirty Dragon Show (now set in \\"Carefree Corners\\") began a one-year run on WGN. Meanwhile, Jackson began commuting between Chicago and New York, where he produced and hosted another local show, BJ's Bunch, featuring many of the same characters. By the fall of 1974, WGN cancelled The BJ & Dirty Dragon Show, after which Jackson produced a one-shot holiday special, A Gift For Granny, which aired on WMAQ-TV, Chicago's NBC affiliate. Later career Jackson and his puppets next appeared in the educationally themed program Gigglesnort Hotel in 1975, which brought most of the old Cartoon Town characters back, plus a few new creations. Produced and broadcast by WLS-TV, Chicago's ABC affiliate, the show was very popular with critics, though less so with the public, and ran for three seasons. Jackson said his influence for the show was Fawlty Towers. He made a final program called Firehouse Follies using the characters in 1979-1980, then left television to teach at California Institute of the Arts for the School of Film/Video for 12 years, retiring in 1990. In a 2001 interview, Jackson expressed some frustration at seemingly not being able to fit into the criteria established for children's programming on network television. He said, \\"I am not \\"teachy\\" enough for PBS and am not considered worthy enough for Nickelodeon.\\" By the end of its run, Gigglesnort Hotel was syndicated nationally, and reruns continued to air on WLS in Chicago through 1985. Several episodes were released by Karl-Lorimar Home Video in the 1980s in a series of six volumes, one of which actually consisted of two holiday specials Jackson produced in California after he left Chicago: Billy Joe's Thanksgiving --aka Salute To The Turkey-- and a later remake of A Gift For Granny, which featured a green incarnation of Dirty Dragon and a female voice artist as Mother Plumtree. In recent years, Jackson has started a website to sell DVDs of his old programs online. He lives quietly in California with his wife, Jo. While his shows were on the air, Jackson received two Iris Awards for the best locally produced children's show in the United States, as well as local Emmys for the shows and his role in them.(PDF)(PDF)(PDF) In 2005, he became a member of the Chicago chapter of the National Academy of Television Arts and Sciences Silver Circle. (PDF) Ten years earlier, he donated all his original puppets to Chicago's Museum of Broadcast Communications. In 2008 he published a memoir called The Only Kid on the Carnival. In 2009, he produced a documentary, Remembering Cartoon Town and B.J. & Dirty Dragon. Jackson said in an interview when the DVD was released, that many of the Cartoon Town episodes were not preserved. Jackson also appeared for a presentation for the Museum of Broadcast Communications, \\"Saturday Morning with B.J. and Dirty Dragon: Bill Jackson, Live in Person‚ÄîOne Last Time\\", in December 2009. He indicated this would be his last time appearing as a performer.

Life and career Born in San Francisco, Schmitz was the son of an Irish mother and a German father. He played the violin and conducted the orchestra at the Columbia Theatre on Powell Street in San Francisco. He was president of the Musicians' Union, when city boss Abe Ruef chose him to run for mayor of his hometown on the ticket of the Union Labor Party. Schmitz was elected on November 7, 1901, thereafter giving protection to criminals, including houses of prostitution for protection money, while remaining popular with the working class. Despite opposition from a reform candidate backed by a fusion party, he was reelected in 1903 and 1905, each time by wide majorities. In 1905, Schmitz won by a very large vote, receiving 40,191, whereas only 28,687 were cast for John S. Partridge. He was still mayor when the 1906 San Francisco earthquake and subsequent fire destroyed a prodigious amount of the city. On the day of the earthquake, Wednesday, April 18, 1906, he invited a cross-section of the city's most prominent businessmen, politicians and civic leaders, but none of the members of the Board of Supervisors, to form the Committee of Fifty to help him manage the crisis. On June 13, 1907, Schmitz was found guilty of extortion and bribery. The bribery scandal was one of the many San Francisco graft trials, which included Schmitz, Tirey L. Ford, and attorney Abe Ruef, who were receiving bribes. The office of mayor was declared vacant while he was sent to jail to await sentence. Shortly thereafter, he was sentenced to five years at San Quentin State Prison, the maximum sentence the law allowed. He immediately appealed; while awaiting the outcome, he was kept in a cell in San Francisco County Jail. On January 9, 1908, the District Court of Appeals nullified his conviction. Two months later, the California Supreme Court upheld the Court of Appeals' ruling, and he was released on bail pending the resolution of the outstanding bribery indictments. In 1912, he was brought to trial once more, this time on charges of bribery; however, after Abe Ruef was brought from San Quentin to testify and refused to give evidence, and the other key witness, Chief Supervisor James L. Gallagher, fled to Canada, Schmitz was acquitted. Schmitz ran for mayor again in 1915 and 1919, but was soundly defeated due to his past reputation. Elected to the Board of Supervisors in 1921, he remained until 1925. He married Julia Driscoll on June 10, 1891 in Watsonville, California and had two daughters.

The association was founded in 1971 and became a member of the World Organization of the Scout Movement (WOSM) in 1971. The coeducational association had 2,782 members (as of 2010). History In 1912, 17 year old Samuel Blunt de Burgh Edwards formed the first patrol of Scouts in Mauritius and later became the first leader. He is regarded as the founder of Scouting in Mauritius. A number of Scout troops developed. In 1913, The Boy Scouts Association of the United Kingdom established its Mauritian Local Association which became its Mauritian Branch. This branch consisted of different affiliated associations, separated by faiths. Upon the independence of Mauritius in 1968, two reports were launched to ensure the development of Scouting in Mauritius. In 1971, The Mauritius Scout Association was constituted as an autonomous organisation and single successor to The Scout Association's Mauritian Branch and the different religious Scout associations. The association was admitted to WOSM in the same year. The association was incorporated in 1976. Program The aim of the Mauritius Scout Association is \\"to encourage the physical, mental, social, emotional and spiritual development of young people so that they may take a constructive place in society\\". Self-reliance, service and adventure and Scout craft are major features of the program. Proficiency badges are divided into four categories, interest, pursuit, service and instructor. Most Scout groups are sponsored by religious bodies, schools, colleges, and others institutions. All Scouts help during religious processions, regardless of creed, and carry sick people at the F√™te Annuelle des Malades (Annual Festival of the Ill). Community services including helping to evacuate flooded areas during cyclones, assisting in refugee centers, cleaning roads and repairing houses. Scouts are also involved in a variety of community development projects. =Sections= The association is divided in four sections: * Cub Scouts (ages 8 to 11) * Scouts (ages 12 to 15) * Venture Scouts (ages 15 to 18) * Rover Scouts (ages 19 to 25) =Scout Law, Promise and Motto= As most Mauritians speak French, the French version of Scout Law, Promise and Motto are more frequently used than the English ones. Both versions are part of the association's constitution. The Scout Motto is Toujours Pr√™t or Be Prepared. Scout Promise * Sur mon honneur je promets de faire de mon mieux, pour servir Dieu et mon pays, d'aider les autres, et d'observer la Loi Scoute. * On my honour, I promise that I will do my best, to do my duty to God and to my country, to help other people and to keep the Scout Law.

History The regiment was formed in the aftermath of the Abyssinia Crisis (1935). Fearing an Italian threat to the British colonies in East Africa, the Colonial Office ordered the reform of the military units in Kenya Colony. A section of the Territorial Army was established for white settlers to complement the long- established King's African Rifles (KAR) which comprised black soldiers under white officers. It was originally designated Kenya Regiment (Territorial Force) and subsequently expanded, also recruiting white settlers in Uganda Protectorate. At the outbreak of World War II in 1939, the unit's personnel were re-allocated to the KAR and Northern Rhodesia Regiment. Kenya Regiment soldiers also formed the basis for the creation of the Kenya Armoured Car Regiment. The regiment was recalled in 1950 and participated in the repression of the Mau Mau uprising (1952‚Äì56). It was disbanded with the independence of Kenya in 1963.

A gateway to the complex remains in central Tijuana The Agua Caliente Casino and Hotel opened in 22 June 1928 in the Mexican city of Tijuana, Baja California. It was a lavish resort that included a casino, spa, championship golf and tennis facilities, its own airstrip, and a lot of entertainment. Stylistically, the resort was an amalgam of Mexican colonial, California mission, and neo-Islamic designs that ranged from mosaic minarets, to cozy guest bungalows, to steaming Turkish baths. It was designed by 19-year-old architect Wayne McAllister and built by Baron H. Long, Wirt G. Bowman and James N. Crofton. Some sources note the fourth partner was Abelardo L. Rodr√≠guez, Military Commander and Governor of Baja California, and future Mexican President. The $2.5 million Agua Caliente racetrack opened in December 1929. Drinking, gambling, and horse racing were illegal in neighboring California, so many wealthy Americans and Hollywood celebrities flocked to Agua Caliente. Rita Hayworth was discovered there while performing in a show. The films In Caliente and The Champ were filmed on location there. The highlight of the opulent casino was the Gold Room, where patrons could only bet using gold chips, with a rumored $500 minimum wager. Bugsy Siegel cited Agua Caliente as his inspiration for building the resort on what became the Las Vegas Strip. Mexican President L√°zaro C√°rdenas outlawed gambling in 1935 and closed the resort. It became a state-run school, Escuela Preparatoria Federal L√°zaro C√°rdenas and eventually fell into disrepair. Remnants of the original buildings remain next to the Plaza Minarete strip center at the end of Avenida Sanchez Taboada. Although the casino and hotel were closed, the racetrack continued to operate for many years. The original grandstand structure was destroyed by fire in 1971, but was rebuilt and continues to operate today as the Agua Caliente Racetrack and casino, a branch of the Casino Caliente chain.

(FPI), doing business as UNICOR (stylized as unicor) since 1977, is a wholly owned United States government corporation created in 1934 as a prison labor program for inmates within the Federal Bureau of Prisons, and a component of the Department of Justice. It is headquartered in Washington, D.C. Under US federal law, all physically able inmates who are not a security risk or have a health exception are required to work, either for UNICOR or at some other prison job.Title XXIX, ¬ß2905 of the Crime Control Act of 1990 (P.L. 101-647) required that all offenders in federal prisons must work (the act permitted limitations to this rule on security and health-related grounds). Inmates earn from US$0.23 per hour up to a maximum of US$1.15 per hour.  History  A statute in provided for the employment of prisoners, the creation of a corporation for the purpose was authorized by a statute in , and the Federal Prison Industries was created by executive order in . of This rehabilitation includes payment, ranging from $0.23 to $1.15 per hour, as well as learning new skills provided by the job industry the inmate was given. There are a variety of different aspects under which one could pursue a job, including agribusiness, clothing and textiles, electronics, recycling, office furniture, and services. If an inmate has a debt they must pay off, they are required by law to put at least 50% of their earnings towards paying off this debt. In 1977, FPI gained the trade name UNICOR. The prisons began to overpopulate in the 1980s after stricter laws became present. In hopes to create and sustain a new client base, UNICOR decided to campaign, but this brought about controversy within citizens. Although it did benefit them by bringing them more clients, it also made some individuals fear that it was at an unfair advantage and would negatively affect the private sector by providing low cost goods and not having to pay the workers as much. UNICOR countered this with the fact that they do not actually impact the private sector significantly and it is beneficial for the inmates to take part in by giving them life skills. Since the early 2000s up until the present day, UNICOR has increased in the number of inmates it has employed. In the most recent years, beginning in 2011, UNICOR has been working on an environmental initiative plan to create more eco-friendly ways of working in the industry. Inmates are able to receive certifications in various aspects such as a commercial drivers‚Äô license, SAP technician, and quality improvement associate as of 2016. Purpose While in the program, inmates are given vocational training. By equipping inmates with a skill set in a vocation, UNICOR aims to reduce recidivism and give former inmates the means to support themselves in post-institutional life. There is a large debate over the Federal Prison Industry and its motivations. Some people believe that the FPI is just a business competing with other industries and making a profit off of its workers, while others believe it is what it was originally intended to be- a place for troubled inmates to go through rehabilitation and better themselves and learn skills in order to one day go back into the real world as a ‚Äúnew‚Äù person who has grown from their past. The individuals fighting against the FPI oppose its values because it often requires mandatory purchases from other companies. Opposers claim that this is unfair to be required to purchase these products because it is only profiting incarcerated individuals and a ‚Äúmonopoly‚Äù-like corporation. Activities Under current law, all physically able inmates who are not a security risk or have a health exception are required to work, either for UNICOR or at some other prison job.Title XXIX, ¬ß2905 of the Crime Control Act of 1990 (P.L. 101-647) required that all offenders in federal prisons must work (the act permitted limitations to this rule on security and health-related grounds). Inmates earn from US$0.23 per hour up to a maximum of US$1.15 per hour, and all inmates with court-ordered financial obligations must use at least 50% of this UNICOR income to satisfy those debts. UNICOR operates at no cost to taxpayers, in that it receives no appropriated funds from Congress to run its operations. In fiscal year 2016, UNICOR had net losses of $18 million. In fiscal year 2016, approximately 17,900 inmates participated in the UNICOR program, which equates to approximately 10% of the inmate population eligible to participate in this program in BOP-managed facilities. All federally incarcerated individuals are expected to work in BOP-managed facilities. In general, those who choose to participate in UNICOR's voluntary industrial work program earn between $0.23 and $1.15 per hour. There are exceptions, in particular the Prison Industry Enhancement Certification program, whereby inmates earn up to the prevailing wages paid for comparable work performed in the locality. Deductions are then taken for taxes, victim restitution, program costs and court-imposed legal obligations. In 2016, UNICOR generated $498 million in sales, of which 72% was used to purchase raw materials, equipment and other supplies to produce the products and services it offers for sale; 23% paid staff salaries; and 5% paid inmate workforce wages. In fiscal year 2016, FPI‚Äôs business were organized, managed, and internally reported as six operation segments based upon products and services. These segments are Agribusiness, Clothing and Textiles, Electronics, Office Furniture, Recycling, and Services.Prison labor in a UNICOR program producing uniforms.FPI has manufactured a diverse set of products, and provided a range of services offerings, in accordance with its statutory mandate, for the Federal government for over 80 years. As of August 2016, UNICOR operates 66 factory operations within 52 federal prisons, nationwide, offering more than 100 products and services in 80 Federal Supply Classifications (FSCs), in areas including clothing and textiles, electronics, fleet management and vehicular components, industrial products, office furniture, recycling activities; and services including data entry, computer- aided design (CAD), and distribution. While UNICOR's customer base consists primarily of federal government agencies, it also collaborates with private sector companies to support their subcontracting needs. It offers qualifying U.S. manufacturers domestic facilities and inmate workforce resources to repatriate their operations, with costs comparable to those of offshore production and other benefits. UNICOR currently produces the Interceptor body armor vest, primarily for foreign sales and international customers.Award of Interceptor OTVs federalcompass.com, 29-Sept-2008 Federal Acquisition Regulation (FAR) Subpart 8.6 outlines mandatory source procurement provisions under which federal agencies are to purchase products which are listed on UNICOR's Schedule of Products and deemed comparable in price, quality and delivery to those available from the private sector. While the guidelines differ slightly between Department of Defense and civilian agencies, in all cases decision-making purchasing authority rests with the agency's contracting officials. In 2003, UNICOR's Board of Directors exempted micro-purchase level orders of $2,500 and under from the FAR provision which required agencies to obtain waiver approval from UNICOR as a condition for purchasing like items from the private sector. In 2016, the Board increased the \\"administrative waiver\\" amount to $3,500, in line with updated micro-purchase levels. Federal agencies are authorized to purchase services from FPI, but not required to do so. Criticism One report detailed an FPI operation at a California prison in which inmates de-manufactured computer cathode-type monitors. Industry standard practice for this mandates a mechanical crushing machine to minimize danger from flying glass, with an isolated air system to avoid releasing lead, barium, phosphor compounds to the workplace atmosphere. At the FPI facility prisoners demanufactured CRTs with hammers. FPI initiated corrective action to address this finding, and claims to currently meet or exceed industry standards in its recycling operations. Combat helmets produced by FPI at one factory were at the center of a US Department of Justice lawsuit and $3 million settlement paid by ArmorSource, the prime contractor. The U.S. Attorney's Offices declined to criminally prosecute or file any civil action against FPI staff. The helmets were produced for ArmorSource between 2008 and 2009 and failed to meet standards. The DOJ investigation did not develop any information to indicate military personnel sustained injury or death as a result of the defective ACH helmets. Immediately after FPI leadership became aware of the manufacturing concerns surrounding the ACH helmets, FPI began taking corrective action. FPI recalled its only shipment of Lightweight helmets for re-inspection, and ensured no Lightweight Helmets manufactured at the factory were sent to the military. The recall of both helmets cost FPI $19 million. With Defense Contract Management Agency audit staff, FPI identified opportunities to improve its Quality Management System in areas including improved management staff oversight, proper control of quality procedures, training, and implementation of corrective action. FPI implemented new procedures to address these areas.

The area was originally two separate villages with Dalmuir Shore joining with Clydebank in 1886 and Dalmuir Village in 1906, during a period of rapid industrialization and expansion. Dalmuir is bounded by the village of Old Kilpatrick to the west, the Mountblow and Parkhall housing schemes to the north, and the Clydebank town centre area to the east. To the south is the River Clyde. Geography Dalmuir is situated mostly on the alluvial plains of the River Clyde, south of the former volcanic Kilpatrick Hills. The Kilpatrick Hills are a part of the Clyde Plateau Lavas. Near the west boundary is Duntocher Burn running down to the Clyde from the high ground that forms the north perimeter of the area. Transport The area was initially accessed from the River Clyde via an old quay for loading and landing goods at Dalmuir Shore, the current location of the Golden Jubilee Hospital. Prior to 1790, Bridge Street ran from Dalmuir Shore directly to Dumbarton Road. The main thoroughfare through the village is Dumbarton Road that was originally a toll road from Yoker Bridge to Old Kilpatrick and onto Dumbarton. In 1777, there was a second road from approximately Duntocher Road connected Boquhanran and Kilbowie to the north-east running along the current Second Avenue. On the Auchentoshan Estate lands to the north was the old Roman Road and predecessor route of the Great Western Road A Map of the Shire Dumbarton (Ross 1777). Source: NLS Online An Act of Parliament in 1768 authorized the construction of the Forth and Clyde Canal starting \\"at or near a place called Dalmuir Burnfoot, in the county of Dumbarton\\". With an initial investment by Sir Lawrence Dundas, 1st Baronet, the canal was completed on 28 July 1790.Joseph Priestley, A Historical Account of the Navigable Rivers, Canals, and Railways, of Great Britain, Longman, Rees Orme, Brown and Green, London, 1831 Two narrow timber double-leaved bascule bridges were located at Dumbarton Road and at Dalmuir Farm next to the Duntocher Burn. The bridge at Dumbarton Road was replaced with a swing bridge in 1915 and in 2010 by the only drop lock in Europe, as part of the canal's revival and re-opening. The railway arrived in 1858 with the opening of the Glasgow, Dumbarton and Helensburgh Railway linking Queen Street Station Glasgow with the Caledonian and Dumbartonshire Junction Railway at Bowling. The station was originally located at Park Road until it was relocated in 1897 to its current location creating two more platforms as part of the extension to Dalmuir of the Glasgow, Yoker and Clydebank Railway. A fifth platform was added as part of the Argyle Line expansion in 1979. Dalmuir railway station was briefly renamed Dalmuir Park in 1952 until 1973 and is now part of the North Clyde Line. The area previously had a second station, Dalmuir Riverside, Dalmuir Riverside, built by the Lanarkshire and Dumbartonshire Railway, which operated from 1896 till 1966, primarily serving the William Beardmore Shipyard area. Joshua Heywood Collins of Kelvindale, the son of the last paper mill owner was the Chairman of the Lanarkshire and Dumbartonshire Railway who cut the ceremonial first sod in 6 October 1891 at Maryhill for the railways ground breaking. Dalmuir was also served by Glasgow street trams from 1904 but terminating at the canal until the construction of the swing bridge in 1915 extended the route to a new terminus at Dalmuir West. Starting from the other side of the canal bridge, a service from Dalmuir to Bonhill in Dumbarton ran from 1908 to 1928. Until 1915, passengers traveling by tram from Glasgow to Dumbarton had to change trams and walk across the bascule bridge at Dumbarton Road. Watched by a crowd of 200,000, the last Glasgow tram left Dalmuir West Terminus on 4 September 1962. The journey was featured in the film, 'Nine Dalmuir West' - A Record of the Last Weekend of the Glasgow Trams. The No 9 Dalmuir to Auchenshuggle service was replaced by the number 64 bus.

Male life expectancy is 73.7 years and female life expectancy 75.0 Years. Although life expectancy for males has risen by 6 years in the 14 years since 1997 and female life expectancy risen by 1 year, it has remained below the West Dunbartonshire and Scottish average. The proportion of the population aged 0‚Äì15 is 18%; 16-64 is 65%; 65-74 is 8% and 75 and over is 9% (13% higher than in West Dunbartonshire as a whole).

Due to local resistance, and the support of the Scotch Education Department, the transfer of Dalmuir pupils did not occur. Instead a former Masonic Lodge on what is now Beadmore Street was used until a purpose built school was completed on Auld Street in 1886.https://www.west-dunbarton.gov.uk/leisure-parks-events/museums-and- galleries/collections/buildings/schools-and-colleges/schools-and-colleges- clydebank/dalmuir-public-school/ In 1908 a new school was opened on Duntocher Road on the corner of Singer Road. Later a junior Secondary School was added. In 1962 the school was destroyed by fire and a new primary School built to the east along Singer Street. Dalmuir primary was one of the largest schools in the UK with a pupil roll of 1200.

Originally it only showed silent films and was closed in 1966. =Dalmuir Park= Opened in 1906 and originally named Overtoun Park, it consists of of landscaped and open space with a golfcourse, bowling green, tennis courts and children's play areas. The park has main entrances at Mountblow and Overtoun Road and originally a level crossing at the original Collins Mill access close to the Beardmore tenements and Dalmuir Village. The replacement underpass tunnel was added in 1907, which gave access to the grounds of Dalmuir House, which were incorporated into the Park in 1908. The park went under a renovation in 2013. A municipal golf course is located at the north end of Dalmuir Park on Overtoun Road. The course is a highly rated municipal owned 18 hole course, 5349 in length and a par of 68. Dalmuir Park Bowling Club is located in the Park at Overtoun Road. There is another bowling club, Dalmuir Bowling Club on Stevenson Street that was founded in 1883. =Dalmuir Square= Dalmuir Square is an open space created in the late 1970s after demolition of the Beardmore tenements on Dumbarton Road between Swindon and Dunn Streets. It is the centre of retail and community facilities and also serves as a transport hub. The square is surrounded by the main shopping stores, community cafe and public library. In 2017 revitalisation work commenced to create a town square with the addition of a play area, landscaping, local cultural information, seating, lighting and signage. =Public Houses= The area has five public houses - Mountblow Bar, Mackintosh Bar (Macs), Horse and Barge, Cabin Inn and the Park Bar. All are located along Dumbarton Road. The Mountblow Bar on Scott Street opened in the early 1900s and was recently renovated in 2019. Mackintosh Bar (Macs) was originally located from the early 20th century in a tenement opposite French Road and relocated to Swindon Street in the early 1980s. The Horse and Barge, formerly named O'Kanes and Ace of Spades, is the largest of the pubs in Dalmuir. The Cabin Inn, formerly Learags and the Drop Inn, has also been recently renovated. The original Park Bar opened in the 1920s was destroyed in the Clydebank Blitz, and in a move meant to be temporary, relocated to its current location on Dumbarton Road in 1941. Opened in the early 1980s, Peppermint Park was a nightclub on Dunn Street above the Dalmuir Co-op. The nightclub closed in the mid 1990s and the upper floor has been vacant since. History The area was at the most northerly-west part of the Roman Empire with Antonine Wall forts to the west at Old Kilpatrick and north at Duntocher from AD 142 until it was abandoned in AD 162. There was a brief re-occupation for a few years, starting in AD 208. In 1281 the land was first recorded as owned by Walter Spreul, Steward of Malcolm, Earl of Levenax, in the \\"Charter Records of the land of Dalmuir or Dalmore\\".https://www.surnamedb.com/Surname/Spreull From the 13th to the early 19th century the land was held by the Spreull family. In the 1750s the area was called DamurOS Map James Dorret 1750 or Dalmar OS Roy Lowlands 1752-1755 and in 1768, Dalmuir Burnfoot.Joseph Priestley, A Historical Account of the Navigable Rivers, Canals, and Railways, of Great Britain, 50 Longman, Rees Orme, Brown and Green, London, 1831 In the 18th century the area was mostly arable land, undivided moor capable of grazing 266 sheep, with a small mansion, near the Duntocher Burn, called \\"Dallmuir House\\" Owner of the Duntocher Mill, Faifley Mill, and the Mountblow lands, William Dunn, purchased the Dalmuir lands in 1828. To the west was Dalmuir Farm and the two Buchanran farms to the east.Ordnance Survey 6 Inch (1843-1862) In addition to the original Dallmuir House and estate, to the north were the estates of Auchentoshan and Mountblow. Auchentoshan Estate was owned by James Hamilton, Earl of Abercorn until 1612. Auchintoshan House, built in the 17th century, was destroyed in the Clydebank Blitz in March 1941. One of the last residents was Sir Thomas Bell, Managing Director of John Brown & Co. Originally 24 acres of the Auchentoshan Estate, the Mountblow Estate was created in 1767 and Mountblow House built by Robert Donald, a tobacco merchant. The house was also destroyed in the Clydebank Blitz in March 1941. =Dalmuir Glen= The first industrialization was the paper mill opened in 1747 by Edward Collins. Originally from Shropshire, he moved to Scotland in 1745, initially setting up a paper mill in Kelvindale. He died in January 1784. Powered by the Duntocher Burn at Dalmuir Glen, the water was diverted through the Mill Lade to the High Dam to provide power to the mill's Upper Works. High Dam was later converted to Overtoun Park's duck pond. Thatched whitewashed stone cottages for workers grew around the mills along Dumbarton Road, creating the village of Dalmuir. By the 1790s the statistical account records the paper mill as the fourth or fifth largest in Scotland. Also in 1790 the Forth and Clyde Canal opened. The mill was run by Edward Collin's son, Richard Collins born in Dalmuir in 1752 who died in March 1822, then his son Edward Collins born September 1794, who died in July 1864. Edward Collins set up a steam powered mill in Kelvindale in 1840. In 1845, the Dalmuir paper mill employed 180 persons (63 men, 91 women, 17 boys and 5 girls) and paying 10,000 in tax per year. The Collins mill closed in 1857 and manufacturing and workers were moved to the Kelvindale factory, however a calico print works continued until the early 20th century. In 1882 The Gazetteer of Scotland, by Rev. John Wilson, described the village - \\"DALMUIR, village, 6¬º miles east-south-east of Dumbarton. It has a post office under Glasgow, a railway station, extensive paper-works, and a public school with about 75 scholars. Pop. 936.\\" A proposal to incorporate Dalmuir Village into Clydebank was rejected in 1890, but eventually passed in 1906. Dalmuir Glen was later converted into Overtoun Park in 1906. =Dalmuir House= The original Dallmuir (different spelling) house existed in 1777. A new Dalmuir House, located on the hill close to the end of what is now Regent Street, was built in 1818 by paper mill owner, Richard Collins. It was originally accessed from the Collins' mill area and featured a kitchen garden and views across the River Clyde. The estate was purchased by William Dunn, then in 1908 by Clydebank Burgh Council when the grounds were incorporated into Overtoun Park. The building was demolished in 1929. =Dalmuir Shore= Dalmuir Shore, the second settlement and village in its own right, grew around a soda works established in 1800 on an existing quay by the father of Lord Dundas under the supervision of Earl of Dundonald. The Soda works produced 30 tons of sulphuric acid weekly as well chloride of lime and oil of vitriol, employing nearly 100 people, all male working two 12 hour shifts each day for 11s per week. It had an unsightly appearance with low blackened range of buildings facing the Clyde. The village closed in 1859. The Clyde Navigation Trust became responsible for dredging and maintaining the river as a result of the Clyde Navigation Act of 1858. Around 1860 the Trust enlarged the old quay at Dalmuir Shore and developed the surrounding 8 acres for workshops to maintain their dredging equipment. In 1886 the Dalmuir Shore area, was incorporated into the new Clydebank Police Burgh. Lanarkshire and Dumbartonshire Railway, opened the Dalmuir Riverside railway station in 1896. Dalmuir Shore was located on the north-west of the William Beardmore and Company site and now part of the Golden Jubilee Hospital grounds. =William Beardmore and Company= In 1900, William Beardmore began construction at Dalmuir Shore of what would become The Naval Construction Yard and the largest and most advanced shipyard in the United Kingdom at the time. Notable warships produced included HMS Agammemnom, Dreadnoughts includingHMS Conqueror and aircraft carrier HMS Argus. Beardmore expanded the activities at Dalmuir to include the manufacture of a variety of arms, armaments, aircraft, airships, motor cars, taxis and tanks. The site employed 13,000 people at its peak, resulting in rapid housing expansion along Dumbarton Road. The post war recession hit the firm hard, and the shipyard was forced to close in 1930. Part of the site and some of the existing buildings later became incorporated into ROF Dalmuir in 1939, part was used by the General Post Office for their cable-laying ships. The site was sold to Babcock & Wilcox in 1957 until 1969. During the 1970s the site was converted into the Clydebank Industrial Estate and in recent years has also formed the location of the Golden Jubilee Hospital and the Beardmore Hotel. =Overtoun Park= The old Collins' paper works at Dalmuir Glen was converted into a public park, with the High Dam made into a duck pond and the upper works forming the park's flower gardens. It was opened in 1906 as Overtoun Park, named after local businessman and philanthropist Lord Overtoun,The Late Right Hon Baron Overtoun, Who's Who in Glasgow in 1909 who gifted the ¬£5,000 required to purchase the land from Mr W P Macindoe, a descendant of William Dunn (he also made a similar donation for a park of the same name in his birthplace of Rutherglen around the same time). The land around Dalmuir House was incorporated in 1908 to form the east part of the park. =Dalmuir Farm= Located west of the Duntocher Burn, north of the Forth and Clyde Canal, Dalmuir Farm existed until the 1920s. In 1882, Robert Renwick was the farmer and in 1904, John Filshie. The Dalmuir West tram terminus was constructed in 1915. Clydebank's boundary was extended to include Dalmuir West in 1925 and the first phase of the Council-built Mountblow housing scheme north of Dumbarton Road was completed in 1933. After the war, pre-fab houses were added to the south of Dumbarton Road and were replaced in 1970 by the white house scheme. Locally called the Coosie, the field to the west of the scheme formerly contained a curling pond.OS Six Inch 1843-1882 The tram terminus was demolished in the early 1970s. =Housing expansion= Workers housing was constructed to meet the demands of industrial development. Initially for mill workers in the late 18th century, cottages were located on Dumbarton Road that eventually formed Dalmuir Village around the current Burns Street location and bottom of Mountblow Road. The Post Office and housing clustered further east along Dumbarton Road, either side of the Canal bridge.OS 6 Inch (1843-1862). Source: West Dunbartonshire Council/National Library of Scotland After the demolition of Dalmuir Shore in 1860, Clyde Navigation Trust constructed workers tenements further east along Dumbarton Road at Nairn and Boquhanrans Streets. The Dalmuir Co-operative constructed tenements on the other side of Dumbarton Road around Gladstone Street. The Crescent was a semi circular three storey tenement located at Dalmuir Station built as a speculative development and financed by the City of Glasgow Bank until it collapsed in October 1878. It was not completed and eventually destroyed in the 1941 Clydebank Blitz. Higher end villas were constructed in the late 19th century on the Hill, in the area now called High Dalmuir, around Duntocher Road. Approximately 15 large detached 2 storey villas with large gardens were constructed along with more modest homes. William Beardmore purchased several of the High Dalmuir villas for their management, particularly at Regent Street and Duntocher Road. After 1900, Dalmuir & West of Scotland Estates Co, owned by Beardmore, constructed and managed 110 four-storey tenements, completing the expansion west to Mountblow Road for workers and east to Agamemnon Street, which housed foremen. The Mountblow estate north of Dumbarton Road was completed in 1933. Prefabs were constructed on the south of Dumbarton road at Dalmuir Farm and Dunn Street after the war. High rise residential towers were built starting in 1954 with Mountblow House and eleven residential hi-rises were completed by the end of the 1960s. The whitehouses, built to replace the prefabs at Dalmuir west, were completed in the early 1070s. Infill housing in blitz gaps between tenements were completed along Dumbarton Road in the 1980s. Further infill development between tenements on blitz gaps continued in the 1990s and then private modern terraced houses built in former industrial land to the east at Benbow road and Caledonia Street were built after 2000.

Together with Josef Dobrovsk√Ω, he is considered to be a creator of the modern Czech language. Life Jungmann was the sixth child (out of ten) of a cobbler. His father was of Bohemian German descent and his mother was of Czech descent. The children grew up speaking both languages at home, which contributed heavily to Jungmann's later role as a revivalist of the Czech language. In his youth, he wanted to become a priest. After he completed grammar school in 1788-1792 however, he went on to study Philosophy and Law. Beginning in 1799, he started teaching at the local high school (\\"Gymnasium\\") in Litomƒõ≈ôice (Leitmeritz), which had a German majority at that time. In 1815, he moved to Prague, where he worked until 1845 in the Old Town Academic Grammar School as a Czech professor. He earned a doctorate in Philosophy and Mathematics in 1817; he was the dean of the Faculty of Arts in 1827 and 1838. In 1840, he became the rector of Charles University in Prague. Work Statue of Josef Jungmann in Prague. Jungmann was a rigorous advocate of the rebirth of written Czech language. In contrast to his teacher, Josef Dobrovsk√Ω, he also wrote his works in Czech. In 1805, he published a translation of Chateaubriand's \\"Atala\\". By this, he intended to prove that the Czech language is suitable for complicated artistic texts. Later, he published translations of Johann Wolfgang Goethe, Friedrich Schiller and John Milton. Translation of Paradise Lost by Milton was called by Derek Sayer \\"the cornerstone\\"Derek Sayer, The Coasts of Bohemia: A Czech History. Translations from the Czech by Alena Sayer, Princeton University Press, Princeton 2000, p. 109.9. of modern literary Czech language. Jungmann‚Äôs original poems are few, but include two early Revival sonnets and the short narrative poem Old≈ôich a Bo≈æena. In following years, he published a series of polemic texts, most notably the \\"Talks on Czech Language\\". In 1820, he published \\"Slovesnost\\", which was a kind of a stylistic textbook. In 1825, a \\"History of Czech literature\\" followed. His most important work is the Czech-German dictionary in five volumes (1834‚Äì39). In this dictionary, he laid out the basis for the modern Czech vocabulary. In order to achieve the stylistic range of vocabulary he desired, for poetic effect, and in order to expand the lexical resources of Czech, Jungmann revived archaic words, for which he studied historical documents, or borrowed from other Slavic languages, and created neologisms. Many of his words became a permanent part of the language.

Personal life Yediyurappa was born on 27 February 1943 in a village called Bookanakere in K.R.Pet taluk of Mandya district. His parents were Siddalingappa and Puttathayamma. He was named after the presiding deity of a Shaivite temple built by the great saint Siddalingeshwara at Yediyur in Tumkuru district. His mother died when he was four. He completed his Pre-University College education from Government college, Mandya (Mysore University)- 1960‚Äì61. He belongs to Banajiga sub-sect of Lingayat community. In 1965, he was appointed as a first-division clerk in the social welfare department but he quit the job and moved on to Shikaripura where he joined as a clerk at Veerabhadra Shastri's Shankara rice mill. In 1967, Yediyurappa married Mythradevi, daughter of the rice mill owner. He later set up a hardware shop in Shimoga. Yediyurappa has two sons, Raghavendra, B.Y Vijayendra and three daughters, Arunadevi, Padmavati and Umadevi. In 2004, his wife died after falling into a sump while drawing water. In 2007, he changed the spelling of his name to Yeddyurappa from the earlier Yediyurappa following the advice of his astrologers, to change back again to Yediyurappa before oath taking ceremony on 26 July 2019. He is a proud follower of Basavanna.. In 2020 he was infected by the COVID-19 virus but recovered soon afterwards. Political career Having been associated with the Rashtriya Swayamsevak Sangh from his college days, Yediyurappa's public service began when he was appointed as Karyavaha (Secretary) of the Sangh's Shikaripur unit in 1970. In 1972, he was elected to the Shikaripura Town Municipality and was also appointed as the President of the Taluk unit of the Jana Sangh.Bookanakere ecstatic for its victorious son, Page 6, Times of India, Bangalore Edition, dated 12 November 2007 In 1975, he was elected President of the Town Municipality of Shikaripura. He was imprisoned during the Emergency in India and lodged in the Bellary and Shimoga jails. In 1980, he was appointed President of the Shikaripura taluk unit of the BJP and later went on to become the president of BJP's Shimoga district unit in 1985. In 1988, he became the State President of the BJP in Karnataka. He was first elected to the lower house of the Karnataka Legislature in 1983 and has since represented the Shikaripura constituency six times. He has been a member of the Seventh, Eighth, Ninth, Tenth, Twelfth and Thirteenth Legislative Assemblies (lower house) of Karnataka. Following the 1994 state assembly elections, he became the Leader of Opposition in the Karnataka Legislative Assembly. In 1999, he lost the elections but was nominated by the BJP to become a member of the legislative council (upper house) of Karnataka. Again, he was re-elected in 2004 and became the Leader of Opposition in the Karnataka Legislative Assembly during the chief ministership of Dharam Singh. His first stint in power when he helped Janata Dal (Secular) leader H. D. Kumaraswamy to bring down the coalition government headed by Dharam Singh and form an alternative government with BJP. An agreement was made between the JD(S) and BJP, which specified that H. D. Kumaraswamy would be the Chief Minister for the first 20 months, after which Yediyurappa would become the Chief Minister for the remaining 20 months. Yediyurappa became the Deputy Chief Minister as well as the finance minister in Kumaraswamy's Government. Yediyurappa and Kumaraswamy during the coalition government with JDS in 2006 However, in October 2007, when it was Yediyurappa's turn to become Chief Minister, Kumaraswamy refused to relinquish his post. This forced Yediyurappa and all the ministers from his party to resign and on 5 October, the BJP formally withdrew the support to the Kumaraswamy government. Karnataka came under President's rule which was revoked on 7 November as the JD(S) and the BJP decided to bury their differences and this paved the way for Yediyurappa to become the Chief Minister of Karnataka. Yediyurappa was sworn in as the 25th Chief Minister of Karnataka on 12 November 2007. However, JD(S) refused to support his government over disagreement on sharing of ministries which resulted in his resignation as Chief Minister on 19 November 2007. In Karnataka's 2008 Assembly elections, Yediyurappa contested from Shikaripura against former Chief Minister S. Bangarappa of the Samajwadi Party. The Indian National Congress and JD(S) backed Bangarappa, but despite this, Yediyurappa won the seat by a margin of more than 45,000 votes. He also led the BJP to a historic victory in the state and Karnataka became the gateway for the BJP in south India. He took the oath of office as Chief Minister on 30 May 2008.

Following much pressure from the BJP central leadership, he announced his decision to quit. Finally, he resigned on 31 July 2011. He resigned from his position as Member of Legislative Assembly and primary membership of Bharatiya Janata Party on 30 November 2012, and formally launched the Karnataka Janata Paksha. It is told that his former colleague and senior BJP leader Anna Vinayachandra was the key person who led the movement at national level to demand expulsion from the party which led to his resignation. Although the party and its name were registered in April 2011, Yediyurappa actually launched it in 2012.Yediyurappa joining Karnataka Janata Party for sure, claims founder. He got elected as an MLA from Shikaripura Constituency (Shimoga district) in May 2013. In November 2013, it was announced that he was considering an unconditional return to the BJP. On 2 January 2014 he announced merger with BJP ahead of 2014 Lok Sabha elections. He won from the Shimoga seat of Karnataka in the 2014 Indian general election by a margin of 363,305 votes. In 2016, BJP re-appointed him as the President of Karnataka state BJP unit. He was BJP's CM candidate in 2018 Karnataka Legislative Assembly election. But the party managed to win only 104 seats, 9 short of simple majority. Yediyurappa and Narendra Modi share a laugh in an inaugural function During the aftermath of the 2018 Karnataka Legislative assembly elections, Yediyurappa was invited to form the government and become the Chief Minister by the Governor citing that his party was the single largest in the house with 104 seats (8 short of majority in the assembly). He was sworn in on 17 May 2018 by the Governor Vajubhai Vala, becoming the Chief minister of Karnataka for the third time. He was given 15 days to prove majority by the governor but the Supreme Court intervened and cut it short to just 24 hours and ordered a floor test (trust vote) soon after. The trust vote was to be held on 19 May 2018 at 4pm. Before the trust vote was to begin, however, Chief Minister B. S Yediyurappa gave an emotional speech, following which he resigned citing that he will be unable to prove majority. He thus became one of the shortest-serving chief minister in India with just days in office. Being the chief Minister of Karnataka for the 4th time, Yediyurappa greets Union Home minister Amit Shah at Delhi Due to turmoil in the coalition government of JDS and Congress, 16 MLAS had submitted their resignation to government turning it to minority 2019 Karnataka resignation crisis. But out of 16, MLA Ramalinga Reddy was convinced to join back the fold. After 18 days of up and downs with rebel MLAs not withdrawing their demands and resignations, coalition government had to step down due to defeat of trust vote on 23 July 2019 hereby paving way to BJP and its leader Yediyurappa to stake claim for government formation. He was invited by Karnataka governor Vajubhai Vala on 26 July to form the new government. The by-polls for these 15 out of the 17 constituencies were conducted on 5 December, where all the parties campaigned immensely. B. S. Yediyurappa promised the voters that each candidate would be awarded a ministry if the people vote them. The results were declared on 9 December. BJP and its leader Yediyurappa were victorious by winning 12 out of the 15 contested seats, thereby a gaining a full majority, and a total of 117/224 assembly seats in the 2019 Karnataka Legislative Assembly by-elections.  Controversies  = Court cases and subsequent imprisonment = In five cases issued in 2011, Yediyurappa was alleged to be responsible for illegal de-notification of land. He was jailed during this term and was convicted of corruption. The Karnataka High-court in 2015 set aside this order, thereby quashing the cases against him. After the high court quashed former governor HR Bhardwaj's sanction to prosecute BS Yediyurappa, a special Lokayukta court struck down four other FIRs against him. In a major relief to Yediyurappa and BJP, Karnataka High Court had set aside the sanction given by then-Governor HR Bhardwaj for his prosecution in several cases of alleged illegal de-notification of land, and asked the incumbent Vajubhai Vala to have a fresh look at it. The High Court said\\"Non-consideration of the relevant matters made the order of sanction illegal and resulted in the failure of justice. We are thus of the opinion that the exercise of the power by the Governor was not in accordance with well-settled principles for sanctioning prosecution. We accordingly set aside the order of sanction, dated 21 January 2011, and remit the matter back to his Excellency, the Governor for reconsideration in the light of our discussions above.\\" Yediyurappa was arrested on the evening of 15 October 2011, hours after the Lokayukta court issued an arrest warrant in two cases of corruption for illegally denotifying land in and around Bangalore. Later, he was granted bail on 8 November 2011 after spending 23 days in jail. However, in March 2012, the High Court of Karnataka quashed the FIR registered against him regarding the Mining. A division bench of the high court of Karnataka passed the order stating that \\"Suspicion cannot be a ground to tarnish the image and reputation of a person who is holding a Constitutional post. Even during the course of argument, a specific question was put to Lokayukta counsel to produce any material to connect the petitioner for alleged offences, but he was mum and did not indicate any favours shown by Yediyurappa as the chief minister to any mining company\\". In May 2012, the Supreme Court, temporarily stayed the case on this matter and ordered an official CBI enquiry, to be completed within three months. On 25 July 2012, Karnataka High Court granted anticipatory bail to Yediyurappa in a case relating to alleged irregularities in denotification of government land in 2009. Other cases rejected by the Court were: # Justice K N Keshavanarayana of High Court quashed the complaint alleging encroachment of land in Bhadra Reserve Forest by Yediyurappa and others on 5 February 2013 # Karnataka High Court quashed a case registered against him for irregularities in the Upper Bhadra irrigation project on 10 October 2013 =Operation Kamala= \\"Operation Kamala\\" is a term coined in 2008, when former minister G. Janardhana Reddy used a method to secure support from legislators bypassing the Anti-Defection Law, so as to take BJP past the majority number. In 2018, H. D. Kumaraswamy alleged that BJP is doing \\"Operation Kamala\\" again. In an interview with Deccan Herald in March 2019, Yediyurappa said \\"Operation Kamala was not wrong and I don't regret it.

Allen on January 28, 1936. Background Noe was born in the community of Evans Landing in Harrison County, Indiana, to John M. Noe and the former Belle McRae. He also lived as a child in the area of West Point in Hardin County in Kentucky. His education was limited to county schools. In 1971, he received an honorary LL.D. degree from the University of Louisiana at Monroe, then known as Northeast Louisiana University, to commemorate his lifetime achievements. He served in World War I as a first lieutenant with the 369th Infantry in France. He relocated to Louisiana and garnered a fortune as an independent oilman, both as producer and overriding royalty owner in Texas, Arkansas, and Louisiana. Political career Noe was elected to the state Senate, District 29 (Ouachita and Jackson parishes). He became a legislative floor leader at the request of Governor Huey P. Long Jr. He was chosen president pro tempore of the state Senate and succeeded to the governorship to finish out Allen's term because the sitting lieutenant governor, John B. Fournet, had resigned on his election to the Louisiana Supreme Court. During Noe's brief tenure, he appointed Huey Long's widow, Rose McConnell Long, to finish Long's seat in the U.S. Senate. He also worked toward getting federal money for state highways and establishing a state welfare office. Noe thereafter returned to the state Senate and served until 1940, when he launched his own gubernatorial bid. In the fall of 1936, Noe joined the Reverend Gerald L. K. Smith, a former advisor to Huey Long, in a tour opposing Governor Richard Leche's sales tax on luxury items, revenue that the governor claimed was essential for the state share of the new Social Security program. Noe charged that Leche \\"sold out to Roosevelt to finance Social Security.\\"Smith, Noe to Speak Here Saturday: Pair Will Stop in Minden in Tour of State\\", Minden Signal-Tribune, October 20, 1936, p. 1 In 1940, both he and sitting Governor Earl Kemp Long lost to Sam Houston Jones of Lake Charles in the pivotal Democratic primary. Charles E. McKenzie, who later went on to serve as a Representative in Louisiana's 5th Congressional District was named as the campaign manager for Noe. Noe and Earl Long later buried their differences. A Noe confidant, state Senator Joe T. Cawthorn of Mansfield, switched to the Long faction and undercut the Jones administration through his position as chairman of the Senate Finance Committee. In 1959, Noe and Long ran as an intraparty ticket for governor and lieutenant governor, respectively. Noe finished fourth in the primary and stood with DeLesseps Story Morrison, then the mayor of New Orleans in the pivotal runoff election against former Governor Jimmie Davis. Earl Long, however, supported Davis because of Long's continuing personal dislike of Morrison.\\"Noe Gives Support to Morrison\\", The Shreveport Times, December 10, 1959, p. 1 Three Louisiana State University scholars describe Noe's last campaign, accordingly: > Noe had always been a Huey Long stalwart.

Havard, Rudolf Heberle, and Perry > H. Howard, The Louisiana Elections of 1960, Baton Rouge: Louisiana State > University Studies, 1963, pp. 38-39 The Noe-Long combination was soundly repudiated by the state's Democratic voters, who instead brought back the administration of Jimmie Davis, who first served from 1944 to 1948. Noe finished fourth in the 1959 gubernatorial primary with 97,654 votes (11.6 percent), behind state Senator William M. Rainach, the third-place candidate. Long lost out to conservative former Speaker of the Louisiana House of Representatives Clarence C. \\"Taddy\\" Aycock of Franklin in St. Mary Parish in south Louisiana. Noe was part of the Louisiana delegation to the 1968 Democratic National Convention, which met in Chicago to nominate Vice President Hubert H. Humphrey to carry the banner against Richard M. Nixon and George Wallace. Business success Noe had much more success in his business ventures than he had in politics. Before his governorship, he founded both WNOE in New Orleans and KNOE in Monroe, both named in his honor. After his governorship, he added WNOE-FM in New Orleans and KNOE-TV and KNOE-FM in Monroe. Though an old populist in political inclination, Noe turned conservative in his last years, as demonstrated in editorials through his radio and television stations. He was particularly critical of the nation's \\"left-turn\\" in the 1960s. KNOE broadcast the news report of the legendary Paul Harvey, whom Noe brought to Monroe for a public appearance. Noe also owned and operated farms in his native Indiana, his adopted Ouachita Parish, most notably the Whitehall Plantation, and in rural Tensas Parish adjacent to the Mississippi River. Family and death On May 7, 1922, Noe married the former Anna Gray Sweeney (1901‚Äì1972). Their children were Gay Noe (born 1923), James Albert \\"Jimmy\\" Noe Jr. (1928‚Äì2005), and Linda McRae Noe (born 1938). Jimmy Noe, a prominent New Orleans businessman, inherited the family-owned radio and television stations after his father's death. Noe Jr. turned Republican and supported the GOP gubernatorial nominee David C. Treen in 1972 and was an alternate delegate to the 1972 Republican National Convention that met in Miami Beach to renominate the Nixon-Agnew ticket. Noe exhibit at the Chennault Aviation and Military Museum in Monroe Noe biographical placard at Chennault Museum Noe's daughter-in-law, the former Betty Schlesinger (1926‚Äì2014), a native of Abbeville in Vermilion Parish, was active in the New Orleans Opera Association, the Women's Opera Guild, the New Orleans Ballet Association, the Louisiana Arts Council, and the Louisiana State University Foundation. U.S. President Ronald W. Reagan appointed her to serve on the advisory committee of the Kennedy Center in Washington, D.C. She was a Knight of the Equestrian Order of the Holy Sepulchre of Jerusalem and a recipient of the Order of St. Louis. Jimmy Jr. and Betty Noe, who married in 1955, had five children, Lisa Deane (Tenny), James Noe, III, Erin May (Chet), George Noe (Elizabeth), and Claire Koch (Josh). Noe died in Houston, Texas, from complications from a heart condition. He is entombed alongside his wife in the Emma Lee Short Memorial Chapel Mausoleum of Mulhearn Memorial Park Cemetery in Monroe.

The inscription says, in part \\"They jumped to their death for our freedom.\\" Englandspiel (England Game), or Operation North Pole (), was a successful counter intelligence operation of the (German military intelligence) from 1942 to 1944 during World War II. German forces captured Allied resistance agents operating in the Netherlands and used the agents' codes to dupe the United Kingdom's clandestine organization, the Special Operations Executive (SOE), into continuing to infiltrate agents, weapons, and supplies into the Netherlands. The Germans captured nearly all the agents and weapons sent by the United Kingdom (Britain). Englandspiel was a \\"catastrophe\\" for SOE and the Dutch resistance, \\"a textbook illustration, the world over, in how not to conduct clandestine work.\\" Fifty-four SOE agents sent from England were captured by the Germans and 50 were executed. The Dutch resistance was substantial in numbers but lacked weapons. If armed, as had been the objective of SOE, it might have played an important role helping the allied military forces in their failed attempt to expel the Germans from the Netherlands in 1944. Background The Special Operations Executive (SOE) was created by the United Kingdom on July 22, 1940 in accordance with Prime Minister Winston Churchill's directive to \\"set Europe ablaze.\\" The objective of SOE was to undertake \\"irregular warfare\\" with sabotage and subversion in countries occupied by Nazi Germany and other Axis powers. SOE agents in occupied countries allied themselves with resistance groups and supplied them with weapons and equipment parachuted in from England. Section N was created within SOE to deal with the Netherlands. Section N had four chiefs during the war: R. V. Laming, Charles Blizard (known as Blunt), Seymour Bingham, and R. I. Dobson. In the words of M.R.D. Foot, official historian of the SOE, Section N was \\"not always noted for efficiency.\\" The opposite numbers of the SOE leaders in German-occupied Netherlands were Majors Hermann Giskes of the Abwehr and Joseph Schreider of the Sicherheitsdienst (SD), the intelligent service of the SS. The Netherlands presented geographical challenges to the Dutch resistance and the British intelligence agencies wishing to infiltrate agents and supply arms and supplies to the resistance groups. The country was densely populated and lacked forests and mountains where resistance forces could hide; isolated areas suitable for landing fields of airplanes or parachute drops of arms and supplies for the resistance were hard to find; the coast was flat and the beaches were guarded and often mined by the Germans offering little opportunity to bring in agents and supplies by boat or submarine. Moreover, the Netherlands did not border any neutral, unoccupied country which could be used a staging ground for resistance activities. A bad beginning In late summer 1941 a Dutch agent of the British intelligence agency MI6 was arrested by the Germans in the Netherlands. He had with him a large number of coded messages and a German cryptographer, Sergeant E. G. May, was able to learn the MI6 cipher system. In February 1942, two MI6 agents were captured in the Netherlands which added to the German knowledge of the British codes. At this time SOE depended upon MI6 for its communications and ciphers. Meanwhile, SOE was training Dutch agents to infiltrate into the Netherlands to help a fledgling resistance movement. The agents complained about the deficiencies of their training program. They were given clothing, easily identifiable as British, to be worn in the Netherlands, security was lax, and SOE could not provide the agents in training with names and addresses of contacts and safe houses which they would need in the Netherlands. In response, the British confined the disaffected trainees and only released them in December 1941 after a complaint by the Dutch government-in-exile in England and after the agents signed a agreement to remain silent about their complaints. SOE's first two Dutch agents, wireless operator Huub Lauwers and saboteur Thys Taconis, parachuted into the Netherlands on the night of 6/7 November 1941. Lauwers was captured on 6 March 1942. He was persuaded to send messages to SOE in London, but he omitted from the messages the two security checks (deliberate errors) that were required to be introduced into messages by the sending agent, the scheme for which was known only to the agent and SOE. The presence of security checks in messages indicated that the sender was the legitimate agent and that they were acting under free will. The absence of security checks represented a vitally important duress code, which should have warned SOE that the sender was either an impostor or a legitimate agent who had been captured and coerced into working for the Nazis. Repeatedly ignoring the significance of the absent security checks was a serious violation of the SOE's own transmission protocol. However, SOE London ignored the absence of the security checks and accepted the messages as genuine. Lauwers continued to transmit messages without the security checks and even inserted the letters CAU and GHT (\\"Caught\\") at the beginning and end of messages. SOE London paid no mind. The messages Lauwers transmitted while a prisoner of the Germans included requests that additional agents and supplies be sent to the Netherlands. SOE responded positively. Agents and supplies, including weapons, were usually flown out of Britain at night and dropped by parachute from converted Handley Page Halifax bombers or landed in fields by Westland Lysander STOL aircraft. SOE air operations were based at RAF Tempsford. The agents and supplies were met on arrival and captured by the Germans.  Playing England  Several captured Dutch radio operators continued broadcasting encrypted messages but without security checks, which should have alerted SOE that they had been compromised. SOE's head of codes Leo Marks also claims to have realised that, unlike all other coded messages from agents in other countries, the Dutch messages contained no errors. He reasoned that this was because they were not coded in the field by harried and harassed wireless operators, but by expert German cryptographers. The Dutch messages were too good to be genuine. In the documentary Churchill's Secret Army Marks recounts how a wireless operator ended a telegraphic radio communication with \\"HH\\", which stood for Heil Hitler and was the usual closing for German communications. The other party instantly replied \\"HH\\" which indicated that the transmitter was a German who was used to adding \\"HH\\" to messages automatically and not a British agent who would have been confused by the two letters. Finally, Marks sent a Dutch agent in the Netherlands a deliberately garbled message. Marks reasoned that no ordinary SOE agent could decrypt the message, but that the German cryptographers could and would. The Dutch agent responded to the garbled message, which indicated to Marks that he was transmitting under the control of the Germans. Marks reported these findings to his superior who told him to not discuss the matter with anybody else; no action was taken. Marks claims that the real issue was internal rivalry between the SOE and the SIS; the former did not want to admit error. German wireless operators reported mock resistance groups and sabotage successes to SOE London. When SOE London requested that a agent return to England, he would suddenly meet with a calamity of some sort so could not return. In January 1943, Marks wrote a report to SOE leaders about his suspicions that all or nearly all SOE agents in the Netherlands were in German hands, but it was months before any action was taken. Neither the Dutch section, overseeing operations in the Netherlands, nor other services were notified of his suspicions. The failure of SOE leadership to respond to signs that the Dutch program was controlled by the Germans was probably motivated by both denial of warning signs and inter-departmental competition between SOE and the rival Secret Intelligence Service (\\"C\\") from which SOE had been created. End of Englandspiel In the fall of 1943, two Dutch SOE agents, Pieter Dourlein and John Ubbink, escaped from Haaren concentration camp, made their way to Switzerland. and reported Englandspiel to the Dutch Legation there which passed the information along to the British government. The two agents then utilized one of the escape and evasion lines to get to Spain and hence to London. The Abwehr's Giskes, however, anticipated their arrival by sending a fake message, ostensibly from another SOE agent, that Dourlein and Ubbink were turncoats, having become German agents. The two were imprisoned on their arrival in London and remained in a British prison until after the Normandy Invasion in June 1944. They were later honored by the government of the Netherlands.The Secret War - Englandspiel, broadcast on Yesterday, 21 June 2011. Englandspiel was already on its last legs in fall 1943. The Royal Air Force (RAF) which supplied the planes and pilots for SOE had suspended SOE flights to the Netherlands after May 1943 because of the high casualties to aircraft and airmen. The RAF had noticed that its flights to the Netherlands always arrived without opposition and that landing areas were \\"too bloody perfect,\\" but planes were fired upon during their return trip to England, suffering unusually high losses. In less than a year 12 RAF aircraft were shot down during their return flight from SOE missions in the Netherlands. The denouement of Englandspiel came on 1 April 1944 when Giskes sent a taunting message to SOE complaining about the lack of recent business from England given that he had been servicing them for so long. Giskes' message also promised a warm welcome to any further agents SOE wished to insert into the Netherlands. Aftermath The fifty Dutch SOE agents that had been captured by the Germans were transported to Mauthausen concentration camp in September 1944 as allied military forces were advancing into the Netherlands and were executed. Giskes, the Abwehr mastermind of Englandspiel, was arrested by the British, but after the war was employed by the United States during the occupation of Germany. Some of the officials of the Dutch government-in-exile in London refused to cooperate with SOE when the details of Englandspiel became known to them. They were ordered to do so by the Dutch Prince Bernhard, and a fresh start was made in mid-to-late 1944 under new leadership at SOE. Twenty-five well equipped and trained sabotage teams of two Dutch agents each were parachuted into the Netherlands. However, engendered by Englandspiel the British distrusted the Dutch resistance which prevented it from having an impact in Operation Market Garden, the unsuccessful offensive by allied military forces in the Netherlands in September 1944. The spearhead of the British forces, the First British Airborne Division, was ordered not to cooperate with the resistance.

She is also the sister of Ziad Boutros and the wife of the ex- Minister of defense Elias Bou Saab.\\"Biography of Education Minister Elias Abu Saab\\", (Lebanese) National News Agency, February 15, 2014 Biography Boutros was born in Beirut, Lebanon, on April 1, 1968. Her father is originally from Lebanon, while her mother is from Palestine, with an Armenian background. She was educated at the Rosary Sisters Schools where she sang in the school choir. Growing up, she and her brother were heavily influenced by Ziad Rahbani's works. When she was 12 years old she recorded her first song, entitled \\"A Maman\\", at Elias Al Rahbani studios. This was introduced to her by her music teacher Fouad Fadel. She also recorded two songs, \\"C'est la Vie\\" & \\"Viens dans Ma Vie\\". On October 11, 2006, she announced a new single called \\"Ahibaii\\" (Dearly Beloved). The lyrics are based on a letter sent by Hezbollah secretary general Hassan Nasrallah to the fighters in South Lebanon during the 2006 Summer War between Hezbollah and Israel. The poet Ghassan Matar adapted the original text. The music is composed by Ziad, brother of Julia and arranged by Michel Fadel. The profits from the song's sale went to help the families of Hezbollah fighters and to all Lebanese who died during the Israel- Lebanon conflict. Sales eventually garnered three million dollars for the families of the Lebanese civilians, soldiers, security forces, and Hezbollah fighters who have been killed in the Israel-Lebanon conflict. The sum was triple the original aim, which was only one million dollars. The families of Lebanese soldiers killed during operation Naher el-Bared also received a portion of the money.

It is genetically and physically similar to many other Spanish- style horses, especially those from the Spanish Colonial Horse group. The Florida Cracker is a gaited breed known for its agility and speed. The Spanish first brought horses to Florida with their expeditions in the early 16th century; as colonial settlement progressed, they used the horses for herding cattle. These horses developed into the Florida Cracker type seen today, and continued to be used by Florida cowboys (known as \\"crackers\\") until the 1930s. At this point they were superseded by American Quarter Horses needed to work larger cattle brought to Florida during the Dust Bowl, and population numbers declined precipitously. Through the efforts of several private families and the Florida government, the breed was saved from extinction, but there is still concern about its low numbers. Both The Livestock Conservancy and the Equus Survival Trust consider breed numbers to be at a critical point. Characteristics The Florida Cracker Horse is also known as the Chickasaw Pony, Seminole Pony, Prairie Pony, Florida Horse, Florida Cow Pony and Grass Gut. The modern breed retains the size of its Spanish ancestors, standing high and weighing . They are found mainly in bay, black and gray, although grullo, dun and chestnut are also seen. Roan and pinto colors are occasionally found. They have straight or slightly concave profiles, strong backs and sloping croups. They are known for their speed and agility and excel at trail and endurance riding, and are also used extensively as stock horses. They are sometimes seen in Western riding sports such as working cow horse, team roping and team penning. The Florida Cracker is a gaited horse, with the breed association recognizing two gaits, the running walk and amble, in addition to the regular walk, trot, canter and gallop. The single-footed ambling gait is known as the \\"coon rack\\" by some breed enthusiasts. The foundation genetics of the breed are the same as many others developed from Spanish stock in North and South America, including the Paso Fino, Peruvian Paso and Criollo. The Cracker horse is very similar in type and genetics to the Carolina Marsh Tacky and the Banker horse, both Spanish-style breeds from the eastern United States, but DNA testing has proven that these are separate breeds. History Horses first arrived on the southeast North American mainland in 1521, brought by Ponce de Le√≥n on his second trip to the region, where they were used by officers, scouts and livestock herders. Later expeditions brought more horses and cattle to Spanish Florida. By the late 16th century, horses were used extensively in the local cattle business and by the late 17th century the industry was flourishing, especially in what is now northern Florida and southern Georgia. The horses brought to North America by the Spanish and subsequently bred there included Barbs, Garranos, Spanish Jennets, Sorraias, Andalusians and other Iberian breeds. Overall, they were relatively small and had physical traits distinctive of Spanish breeds, including short backs, sloping shoulders, low set tails and wide foreheads. A Florida Cracker cow The early cattle drivers, nicknamed Florida crackers and Georgia crackers, used these Spanish horses to drive cattle (eventually known as Florida Cracker cattle). The cowboys received their nickname from the distinctive cracking of their whips, and the name was transferred to both the horses they rode and the cattle they herded. Through their primary use as stock horses, the type developed into the Florida Cracker horse, known for its speed, endurance and agility. From the mid-16th century to the 1930s, this type was the predominant horse in the southeastern United States. During the American Civil War (1861‚Äì1865), both belligerents purchased large amounts of beef from Florida, and the Spanish horses bred there were highly desired as riding horses. During this time, there was also a continual introduction of new Spanish blood from Cuba, as horses were traded between the two areas. During the Dust Bowl (1930‚Äì1940), large western cattle were moved into Florida, bringing with them the parasitic screwworm. Cattle with this parasite needed to be treated frequently. The cowboys found that the Florida Cracker horses, bred for working smaller cattle, were not able to hold the western cattle. They replaced the smaller horses with American Quarter Horses. This resulted in the Florida breed almost becoming extinct. =20th century= Florida Cracker Horse in the Paynes Prairie State Preserve The breed's survival during the 20th century is owed to a few families who continued to breed the Cracker horse and kept distinct bloodlines alive. John Law Ayers was one such breeder; in 1984, he donated his herd of pure-bred Cracker horses to the state of Florida. With them, the state started three small herds in Tallahassee, Withlacoochee State Forest and Paynes Prairie State Preserve. By 1989, however, these three herds and around 100 other horses owned by private families were all that remained of the breed. In 1989 the Florida Cracker Horse Association was founded and in 1991 a registry was established. After the registry was created, 75 horses designated as \\"foundation horses\\" and 14 of their offspring were immediately registered. These horses came mainly from four lines of Cracker bloodstock and were designated as purebreds by breed experts ‚Äì partbred horses were denied entry to the registry. As of 2009, around 900 horses had been registered since the foundation of the registry. Effective July 1, 2008, the Florida House of Representatives declared the Florida Cracker Horse the official state horse. As of 2009 there are three main bloodlines of Cracker stock, as well as a few smaller lines. The state of Florida still maintains two groups of Ayers-line horses in Tallahassee and Withlacoochee for breeding purposes and a display group in the Paynes Prairie Preserve. The state annually sells excess horses from all three herds, and individual breeders also send horses to the sale. The Livestock Conservancy considers the breed to be at \\"critical\\" status, as part of the Colonial Spanish Horse family, meaning that the estimated global population of the breed is fewer than 2,000 and there are fewer than 200 registrations annually in the United States. The Equus Survival Trust also considers the population to be \\"critical,\\" meaning that there are between 100 and 300 active adult breeding mares in existence today. However, breed numbers are slowly on the rise. =Chickasaw horse= The original Chickasaw horse, bred by the Chickasaw Indians using horses captured from De Soto's expedition, became extinct after being used to create the Florida Cracker Horse and having some influence on the Quarter Horse. Some sources still use the Chickasaw name to describe the Florida Cracker Horses of today. In the 1970s there was a surge of interest in recreating the Chickasaw using horses bearing strong resemblances to the original breed, but this has since died out and the breed association no longer exists.

When the case finally reached court in July 1986, the Dutch government took Urenco's line, claiming not to have known where the uranium had been mined. =Uranium tails contracts with Russia= According to Greenpeace, Urenco has a standing contract with Russia for the disposal of radioactive waste. In reality, these contracts do not relate to the disposal of waste, but to the sale of depleted uranium tails, which are re-enriched to natural uranium equivalent. As the enricher, Russia would be the owner of any radioactive waste that results from this process. In March 2009, there were protests about the largest-ever load of depleted uranium hexafluoride (') being transported from Germany to the Siberian town Seversk.

It was reprocessed from military surplus, with a typical composition of 60% smokeless powder, 34% sodium nitrate and 6% of 40% nitroglycerin dynamite. Usually used in combination with dynamite, it created an incendiary blast. Since it was very inexpensive, it was often used by farmers to remove tree stumps and clear ditches. The substance was known for being used to commit the Bath School bombing in 1927. Distribution of pyrotol for farm use was discontinued in 1928 due to exhaustion of the supply of surplus explosives. Pyrotol was intended to make a use for a large surplus of smokeless powder after the war. They were manufactured in a contract awarded to the DuPont Company, and was created in three DuPont plants, Gibbstown, N.J., Barksdale, Wisconsin, and DuPont, Washington.

He is now regarded as one of Latvia's finest painters, bringing new ideas in Latvian art at the time, and has several works on display in the Latvian National Museum of Art. Although he spent most of his life abroad his style is a combination of European Modernism and Abstract with a distinctly Latvian influence.  Biography  JƒÅzeps Grosvalds was born on 24 April 1891 in Riga as son of well known Latvian lawyer Frƒ´drihs Grosvalds. His family was quite wealthy and their apartment at the center of Riga was a gathering place for many Latvian intellectuals. JƒÅzeps was raised in typical bourgeois traditions and from an early age was educated in foreign languages, piano play and painting. From 1901 until 1909 he studied in Riga city gymnasium. After graduation his parents financed his trip to Germany where he met his older brother Olƒ£erts a philology student in Berlin. He also had opportunity to meet art historian Kurt Glaser and see original paintings of van Gogh and Manet from his collection. From 1909 until 1910 Grosvalds was a student of Simon Holl√≥sy's school in Munich. In 1911 Grosvalds was drafted into Russian imperial army and spent his one-year service in cavalry regiment which was based in Lithuania. Critical of the opportunities presented by the Munich art establishment, Grosvalds went to Paris in 1910, where he studied at several private academies (for example La Palette). He also has studied under K. van Dongen In addition to this, he immersed himself in the flourishing art scene of the time, inspirited by Parisian artistic and intellectual environment, studying both modern art (C√©zanne, Degas, Renoir) as well as the old masters. In summer of 1914, just before a war was breaking out over Europe, Grosvalds returned to Riga with several other Latvian painters KonrƒÅds UbƒÅns, Voldemars Tone and Aleksandrs Drƒìvi≈Ü≈°. They were determined to create something new - an exciting, challenging and emphatically Latvian art movement. They set up the artists' circle ZaƒºƒÅ puƒ∑e (Green Flower), which transformed over time firstly into the Expressionists' Group and then the Riga Artists Group. In August 1914 he together with his brother Olƒ£erts traveled through Spain. In 1915 Grosvalds was mobilized in Russian army as a cavalry officer and joined the 6th Tukums Latvian Rifleman regiment. He commanded scout unit and actively painted scenes from daily life of soldiers and refugees (cf. The Refugees, 1915-1917 series, and Latvian Riflemen, 1916-1917 series). In 1917 he was commanded to the western front where he soon joined the British army. In 1918 Grosvalds as a British First lieutenant joined the British Expeditionary Group and traveled through Arabia, Persia and Caucasus. His experiences were documented in more than hundred pictures with Persian landscapes (Oriental series, 1918‚Äì1919). For his service he was awarded with the British Military Cross. In summer 1919 Grosvalds was demobilised and replaced his brother Olƒ£erts as a secretary of Latvian delegation in Paris peace conference. In December he started to work in Embassy of Latvia in Paris. He died from Spanish flu on 1 February 1920 in Paris. His cremated remains were stored in P√®re Lachaise Cemetery columbarium until 1925 when they were buried in Riga Great cemetery.

Its producers then launched a daily newspaper named The Evening Mirror, which published from 1844 to 1898. History The Mirror was founded by George Pope Morris and Samuel Woodworth in August 1823. The journal was a weekly publication, and it included coverage of arts and literature in addition to local news. Circulation flagged in the 1840s and at the end of 1842 the paper was closed. In 1843 Morris partnered with popular writer Nathaniel Parker Willis to revamp the business, and together they relaunched the newspaper as The New Mirror, which published weekly for eighteen months. They then established The Evening Mirror in 1844. In all three incarnations, the paper employed many well known literary figures of the day. The Mirror's September 2, 1843 issue saw the publication of \\"Ben Bolt\\" by Thomas Dunn English, which was soon to attain widespread popularity. Edgar Allan Poe worked for the newspaper as a critic until February 1845. In the January 29, 1845 issue, the Mirror was the first to publish Poe's poem \\"The Raven\\" with the author's name. In his introduction to the poem, Willis called it \\"unsurpassed in English poetry for subtle conception, masterly ingenuity of versification, and consistent, sustaining of imaginative lift... It will stick to the memory of everybody who reads it.\\"Silverman, Kenneth. Edgar A. Poe: Mournful and Never-ending Remembrance.

Schindler Jr. (December 13, 1969 ‚Äì October 27, 1992) was an American Radioman Petty Officer Third Class in the United States Navy who was murdered for being gay. He was killed in a public toilet in Sasebo, Nagasaki, Japan, by Terry M. Helvey, who acted with the aid of an accomplice, Charles Vins, in what Esquire called a \\"brutal murder\\". The case became synonymous with the debate concerning LGBT members of the military that had been brewing in the United States culminating in the \\"Don't ask, don't tell\\" bill. The events surrounding Schindler's murder were the subject of ABC's 20/20 episode and were portrayed in the 1997 TV film Any Mother's Son. In 1998, Any Mother's Son won a GLAAD Media Award for Outstanding Made for TV Movie. Background Schindler was from a naval family in Chicago Heights, Illinois, and was serving as a radioman on the amphibious assault ship in Sasebo, Nagasaki. According to several of his friends, Schindler had complained repeatedly of anti-gay harassment to his chain of command in March and April 1992, citing incidents such as the gluing-shut of his locker and frequent comments from shipmates such as \\"There's a faggot on this ship and he should die\\". Schindler had begun the separation process to leave the Navy, but his superiors insisted he remain on his ship until the process was finished. Though he knew his safety was at risk, Schindler obeyed orders. While on transport from San Diego, California, to Sasebo, the USS Belleau Wood made a brief stop in Pearl Harbor, Hawaii. Afterward, en route to Japan, Schindler made a personal prank announcement \\"2-Q-T-2-B-S-T-R-8\\" (too cute to be straight) on secure lines reaching much of the Pacific Fleet. When he appeared at captain's mast for the unauthorized radio message, he requested that the hearing be closed. It was open, with two hundred to three hundred people in attendance. Schindler was put on restrictive leave and was unable to leave the ship until a few weeks after arriving at Sasebo and four days before his death. Murder Airman Apprentice Terry M. Helvey, who was a member of the ship's weather department (OA Division, Operations Department), stomped Schindler to death in a bathroom in a park in Sasebo, Nagasaki. A key witness, Jonathan Witte, saw Helvey repeatedly stomp on Schindler's body while singing. Witte then ran to retrieve Shore Patrolmen nearby, which startled Helvey and Vins into running from the bathroom. Witte returned with Shore Patrolmen in less than 30 seconds and saw Allen Schindler laying on the floor, struggling to breathe through a mouthful of blood. Witte and Shore Patrolmen carried Schindler's body to the nearby Albuquerque Bridge where he died from his injuries. Witte had met Schindler previously two days before his murder, but given the gravity of his injuries, he was unable to recognize Schindler. Schindler had \\"at least four fatal injuries to the head, chest, and abdomen,\\" his head was crushed, ribs broken, and his penis cut (from being cut from his own zipper while fighting and wrestling with Helvey), and he had \\"sneaker-tread marks stamped on his forehead and chest\\", destroying \\"every organ in his body\\", leaving behind a \\"nearly unrecognizable corpse.\\" Witte was asked to explain in detail to the military court what the crime scene looked like, but he refused, as Schindler's mother and sister were present in the courtroom. His family was only able to identify him by the tattoo on his arm. Details revealed The Navy was less than forthcoming about the details of the killing, both to the news media and to the victim's family, especially his mother, Dorothy Hajdys. Navy Officials failed to include his belongings: the log book Allen kept of his time on board, and his record of harassment he was receiving on the advice of friends. In the wake of Schindler's murder, the Navy denied that it had received any complaints of harassment and refused to speak publicly about the case or to release the Japanese police report on the murder. The medical examiner compared Schindler's injuries to those sustained by a victim of a fatal horse trampling saying they were worse \\"than the damage to a person who'd been stomped by a horse; they were similar to what might be sustained in a high-speed car crash or a low-speed aircraft accident.\\" At the wake in the family's home in Chicago, his mother and sister could only identify him by the tattoos on his arm as his face was disfigured. Trial and outcomes During the trial Helvey denied that he killed Schindler because he was gay, stating, \\"I did not attack him because he was homosexual\\", but evidence presented by Navy investigator Kennon F. Privette, from the interrogation of Helvey the day after the murder, showed otherwise. \\"He said he hated homosexuals. He was disgusted by them,\\" Privette said. On killing Schindler, Privette quoted Helvey as saying: \\"I don't regret it. I'd do it again. ... He deserved it.\\" Under a court-approved bargain in exchange for his pleading guilty to \\"inflicting great bodily harm\\", the maximum penalty is lifetime imprisonment. Under the original charge, it was death. After the trial, Helvey was convicted of murder and Douglas J. Bradt, the captain who kept the incident quiet, was transferred to shore duty in Florida. Helvey is serving a life sentence. By statute, Helvey is granted a clemency hearing every year. Initially, he was imprisoned in the United States Disciplinary Barracks. , he is housed at FCI Greenville in Illinois under the inmate number 13867-045.http://www.bop.gov/inmateloc/ Helvey's accomplice, Charles Vins, was allowed to plea bargain as guilty to three lesser offenses, including failure to report a serious crime and to testify truthfully against Helvey, and served a 78-day sentence before receiving a general discharge from the Navy. Legacy The events surrounding Schindler's murder were the subject of a 20/20 episode and were portrayed in the 1997 TV film Any Mother's Son. In 1998, Any Mother's Son won a GLAAD Media Award for Outstanding Made for TV Movie. Schindler‚Äôs mother Dorothy Hajdys became a gay rights activist after his murder. In 1992 she received the National Leather Association International‚Äôs Jan Lyon Award for Regional or Local Work. In 1993 she marched in the March on Washington for Lesbian, Gay and Bi Equal Rights and Liberation.

The only continents never to have hosted a YAPC are Africa and Antarctica. In 2016, YAPC rebranded itself as The Perl Conference, which is the former name of O'Reilly Open Source Convention (OSCON).

It was a non-flying station which was under the control of the United States Air Force from 1981, and one of three RAF stations in Cambridgeshire used by the United States Air Forces in Europe (USAFE). Upwood, along with RAF Molesworth and RAF Alconbury are considered the \\"Tri-Base Area\\" due to their close geographic proximity, and interdependency. History =First World War= The Royal Flying Corps requisitioned of farmland near the village of Upwood in 1917. In September of that year the station opened as Bury (Ramsey). This initial name referred to its location near the village of Bury and the larger market town of Ramsey. Initially there were no permanent flying units assigned to the station. Instead, No. 75 Squadron flying BE.2 aircraft out of nearby Elmswell, Suffolk used the station as a night-landing ground and satellite field. Upon opening, there were no permanent buildings at the airfield. By the summer of 1918 a number of huts and five hangars were in place. It was during this time that the field was renamed Upwood. In July 1918, No. 191 (Night) Training Squadron moved to Upwood. In addition to BE.2s, 191 NTS also flew the DH.6. Whilst at Upwood they converted to the FE.2b. In October 1918, No. 190 (Night) Training Squadron arrived flying the 504K. After the end of the Great War First World War in November 1918, the squadrons were no longer needed and were disbanded in May and June 1919. The airfield itself was returned to the local community and the buildings cleared. This ended the first round of activity at RAF Upwood. =The Inter-War years= In the early 1930s, Britain realised its air defence capabilities were in urgent need of expansion. The major expansion of the Royal Air Force announced in 1934 resulted in many new airfields opening over the remainder of the decade. One of these was RAF Upwood. The old First World War airfield site was selected to be reactivated and expanded. The new station was designed to accommodate two medium bomber squadrons with room for a third. By 1936, construction had begun in earnest with two of five C-type hangars started. On 27 February 1937 the first flying unit arrived at Upwood in the form of No. 52 Squadron RAF flying Hawker Hinds. This unit was joined on 1 March 1937 by No. 63 Squadron and its Hawker Audaxes. During their time at Upwood, No 52 and 63 Squadrons became training units and took on both Fairey Battle and Avro Anson aircraft. In August and September 1939, the two squadrons were reassigned opening the field up to its new tenant, No. 90 Squadron flying Bristol Blenheims. =Second World War= With the invasion of Poland on 1 September 1939, Second World War was underway. However No 90 Squadron spent most of its time in air-to-air firing and bombing practice. They were joined in February 1940 by another medium bomber unit, No. 35 Squadron, flying both Blenheims and Ansons. Both Upwood squadrons were not destined to see front-line combat as, on 8 April 1940, they were merged into the new No. 17 Operational Training Unit RAF and tasked with training aircrews. Although the Upwood units were not taking a direct part in the war, they did see some action. On two occasions in 1940 and once in 1942 the airfield was attacked by Luftwaffe aircraft. However, only one person was killed during these raids. On 1 February 1941 a German spy, Josef Jakobs, was captured by farmers after he had parachuted into the area, breaking a leg in the process.Sellers, Leonard. Shot in the Tower. Leo Cooper, 1997, p. 179. He was discovered to have maps of the RAF Upwood area, a code device and almost ¬£500 cash in his possession.Sellers, p. 179. Jakobs was sent to London where, after a preliminary interrogation by MI5, he spent several months at Dulwich Hospital.MI5 files. KV2/25. National Archives. Jakobs was transferred to Camp 020 in April 1941 where he was interrogated by agents of MI5.Hoare, p.155-156. On August 4 and 5, Jakobs was tried by court-martial at the Duke of York's Headquarters where he was found guilty of treachery.Sellers, p. 179. Jakobs was executed by firing squad at the Tower of London on 15 August 1941.Sellers, p. 179. Since its opening in 1937, Upwood had seen frequent periods where flying operations had to be curtailed or halted altogether due to the grass airfield being unserviceable. This unserviceability was caused by the levels of rain and general dampness of the area. When No 17 OTU was chosen for transition to Vickers Wellington bombers, it was decided to move the unit from Upwood as the field would never take the pounding from these heavier aircraft. When 17 OTU departed for RAF Silverstone in April 1943, Upwood was left with no aircraft. The RAF took this opportunity to begin construction of three concrete runways. These runways were completed by October. The first flying unit to use the new runways at Upwood was No 139 Squadron flying De Havilland Mosquitoes. They arrived in late January 1944 and flew their first mission against on 2 February, a single plane mission to drop target indicators over Berlin. On 5 March 1944 Upwood became home to No 156 Squadron and its Avro Lancasters. They flew their first mission from Upwood on 15 March 1944, attacking Stuttgart with 22 aircraft. At its wartime peak, the station had a working population of over 2,500 people. A total of 210 aircrew from the two squadrons were killed as a result of operations. =Cold War era= With the end of the Second World War came a change in missions for the two squadrons at Upwood. No 156 Squadron was tasked with bringing food to the Netherlands in support of Operation Manna then help repatriate former Prisoners of War as part of Operation Exodus. On 27 June 1945 the squadron was moved from Upwood. In place of the departing No 156 Squadron came No 105 Squadron, also flying Mosquitos. Both 105 and 139 Squadrons continued flying from RAF Upwood until February 1946. On 1 February 1946 No 139 Squadron moved to RAF Hemswell. On 4 February 1946 No. 105 Squadron was disbanded. Flying operations didn't cease for long. On 15 February 1946 Upwood became home to No. 102 Squadron flying Consolidated B-24 Liberator bombers. They spent the next several months bring British troops home from India. On 1 March 1946 the squadron was redesignated No 53. Squadron. The squadron was disbanded on 25 June 1946 soon after its last ferry flight. Two new squadrons of Lancasters called Upwood home starting on 29 July 1946 with arrival of No. 7 Squadron and No. 49 Squadron. On 4 November 1946 No. 148 Squadron and No. 214 Squadron were both reformed at Upwood. These new additions were part of a transition of Upwood from a training to attack mission. Both of the new squadrons also flew Lancasters. The four squadrons continued to fly their Lancasters until 1949 when they were transitioned to Avro Lincolns. Lincolns from 148 Squadron deployed to RAF Shallufa in January 1952 to reinforce British units in the Suez Canal Zone. This was in response to riots in Cairo and a generally unstable political situation in Egypt. During 1954 each of the four squadrons deployed to either RAF Tengah in Singapore in support of anti-communist operations in Malaysia or to Kenya in support of operations against the Mau Mau. Additionally, Lincolns from No 214 Squadron and No 7 Squadron took part in a secret mission in connection with nuclear trials conducted near Woomera, Australia. During this time a film production company produced a war time film play called Appointment in London. The company used three Lancasters in making the film but the background shots are of the four Squadrons of Lincolns and the film uses much of the airfield and buildings in its production showing a good view of Upwood at that time On 31 December 1954 Upwood lost one of its four flying units when No. 214 Squadron disbanded. This unit was replaced on 22 May 1955 when No. 18 Squadron moved to Upwood from RAF Scampton. This squadron brought something completely new to the base in the form of their English Electric Canberra jet bombers. This was followed by more Canberras when No. 61 Squadron moved in from RAF Wittering on 3 July 1955. Two more Lincoln squadrons disbanded on 1 August, 49 and 148. This was followed by the disbanding of the last Lincoln squadron, No. 7, on 1 January 1956. These were replaced throughout 1956 by more Canberra units; No. 50 Squadron on 9 January, No. 35 Squadron on 16 July and No. 40 Squadron on 1 November. However, this last squadron was disbanded on 15 December 1956. Eight Canberras B2 each from Nos. 7, 18,35,50 and 61 Squadron flew to Cyprus on 19 October in support of Operation Musketeer (1956). Over four days in early November, these aircraft took part in raids on various targets in Egypt. This was the first combat operations by Upwood aircraft since the Second World War. The 32 planes returned to Upwood just in time for Christmas, arriving home on 24 December 1956. The next two years saw a series of unit disbandments and arrivals culminating in a slow winding down of flying operations at Upwood. On 1 February 1957, No. 18 Squadron was disbanded. On 31 March 1958 No. 61 Squadron disbanded. No. 542 Squadron arrived on 17 July along with No. 76 Squadron. No 542 Squadron was renamed to No. 21 Squadron on 1 October. The year 1959 saw the disbanding of No. 21 Squadron (15 January) and No. 50 Squadron (1 October). On 31 December 1960 No. 76 Squadron disbanded. The final flying unit No. 35 Squadron was disbanded on 11 September 1961. With the disbanding of No. 35 Squadron Upwood was transferred to RAF Strike Command who quickly set about transforming the airfield into a hub of various support activities. Over the next several months the station became home to No 4 Ground Radio Servicing Section, Radio Technical Publications Squadron, the Aeromedical Training Centre, the Joint School of Photographic Interpretation and three squadrons of HQ No 33 Field Wing, RAF Regiment. The different units had barely settled in when change came again. In early 1963 the RAF Regiment units departed. In 1964 the other units left as well, leaving Upwood with only a token care-taker staff. In March 1964, 22 Group of Technical Training Command arrived and set up their School of Management and Work Study. July saw the arrival of the School of Education and the RAF Central Library, followed in September by the School of Administration. Upwood was again becoming focused on training. Later training units included the Equipment Officers Training Centre and the Air Cadet Training Centre. These various training activities lasted, in one form or another, until the late 1970s. By 1981, the station was again almost dormant. =United States Air Force Use= With the end of RAF use of the station in 1981, the United States Air Force was given control of Upwood by the Ministry of Defence. USAF airmen from RAF Alconbury had been living in the Upwood housing area since the mid-1970s, however when the 10th Tactical Reconnaissance Wing took over as the host unit in December 1981, it started a whole new round of activity. Upwood soon became a satellite station of RAF Alconbury, providing housing and support services for personnel stationed there. In May 1986, all contracting support services moved from RAF Alconbury to the Headquarters building at RAF Upwood. Operating Location 'C', Detachment 4, 7000 Contracting Squadron (OL-C Det 4, 7000 CONS) was an Operating Location out of Detachment 4, 7000 Contracting Squadron at RAF Lakenheath and provided all contracting support services for RAF Alconbury and RAF Upwood. Also in 1986, a multimillion-dollar medical facility was opened to provide out-patient services to American military members and dependents in the area. Upwood was also home to the USAF's 3rd AF Mathies/UK campus for the NCO Academy and NCO Leadership School for USAF enlisted Professional Military Education (PME). The Department of Defense Dependent Schools (DoDDS) operated numerous buildings as classrooms for dependent children on RAF Upwood. In the event of a NEO (Non- combatant Evacuation Order), dependents would be evacuated from the base, and the buildings would be converted into a contingency hospital with supplies and equipment stored in a climate-controlled hangar on the base. =Post-Cold War= With the end of the Cold War in 1991, and the phasedown of RAF Alconbury beginning in 1994, the USAF activities at Upwood were curtailed. RAF Upwood was returned to the British government control in September 1995 and with the number of airmen assigned to the area reduced, the need for housing became less and less. By 2005 the last USAF family moved out of the Upwood housing area and it was returned to the MOD. The medical facilities, however, remain open albeit in a reduced capacity as a medical flight until 16 January 2007, when the 423rd Medical Squadron was formed. The squadron provided some outpatient medical and dental care for the community. The host unit for RAF Upwood was the 423d Air Base Group, headquartered at nearby RAF Alconbury. RAF Upwood was the home of the 423rd Medical Squadron. The squadron operated a medical complex which housed out-patient and dental care facilities for active-duty, dependents of active duty, Department of Defense civilians, and retired military personnel stationed in the Tri-base area. Most standard medical care was available. Complex medical cases could be referred to RAF Croughton (approximately west of RAF Alconbury) for care which is unavailable at RAF Upwood, or to local British civilian National Health Service facilities. On 26 October 2012 RAF Upwood 423rd MDS closed its door to patients for the last time and merged with its sister station and became part of RAF Alconbury. In 1999 the entire NCO married quarter estate including both pre war and post housing and the former NAAFI building were sold to Roger Byron-Collins' the Welbeck Estate Group and were renamed Fairmead Park and underwent a major upgrading. Current status Since 1982, the Nene Valley Gliding Club has conducted its glider operations from a field that occupies the site of the old runways. Initially these operations were under an agreement with the Ministry of Defence. However, in 1995 the club was told they would need to find a new home as the land was going to be sold off. The club was unable to locate a suitable new home and was preparing for the possibility of having to close when the purchaser of the land, Marshal Papworth, agreed to lease the land to the club for 10 years. This has allowed the club to continue flying from Marshals Paddock (so named by the club after their benefactor's death in 2000). Much of the RAF Upwood is unused, closed by the Ministry of Defence in 1994. Most of the station was vacated and the land and buildings sold off to civil ownership. Upwood is also the home of No. 511 (Ramsey) Squadron Air Training Corps who have been on the site since the early 70s. Originally housed in the old fire station the squadron moved to a number of buildings before settling in the old nissen hut church building. When the station was closed by the MOD in 1995, the squadron moved to the Upwood school. The squadron finally settled into the present building inside the fence in 1997. In 2004 Turbine Motor Works purchased a large amount of property on the former base including the four C-type hangars. Their plan is to convert the property into a state-of-the-art jet engine overhaul facility. Together with the Nene Valley Gliding Club and the Air Cadet Squadron, this facility will ensure that the former RAF base will continue its aviation legacy well into the 21st century. Part of the facility is now used by airsoft players. For a number of years, the site was home to the Ramsey 1940s Weekend, an event dedicated to recreating the sights and sounds of the 1940s. The event is held in aid of several local charities and has been rewarded with a tourism award. The weekend features living history re-enactors, period dancing, food, exhibitions and trade stands. This has now moved to the north-west side of Ramsey to \\"The Camp\\", a former searchlight base. The American medical wing was disused as of early 2013, and was demolished over the period of September/October 2015 to make way for private housing.http://www.ramsey1940sweekend.info/ In popular culture RAF Upwood was used as a filming location during the making of the 1953 war film Appointment in London starring Dirk Bogarde, directed by Phillip Leacock.

He became the 39th Governor of Louisiana in 1926, upon the death of his predecessor, Henry L. Fuqua. He was defeatedhe ran third in the critical Democratic primaryin his bid for a full term in 1928 by the legendary Huey Pierce Long Jr., of Winnfield, the seat of Winn Parish. Simpson was born in Washington, a small town in St. Landry Parish in south Louisiana to Samuel F. Simpson and the former Mary Esther Beer. He was educated at Centenary College, then in Jackson in East Feliciana Parish but later relocated to Shreveport, the seat of Caddo Parish. One of Simpson's classmates at Centenary in the 1890 graduating class was later State Senator Thomas Wafer Fuller, who was thereafter the Webster Parish school superintendent. Simpson thereafter attended the Tulane University Law School in New Orleans. He was an attorney in New Orleans from 1893‚Äì1899, when he briefly took the position of warrant clerk at the United States Mint there. In 1899, he married Louise Pichet of New Orleans. They had no children. Thereafter, Simpson was the assistant secretary of the state Senate from 1900 until 1908, when he became secretary of the Senate, a post that he retained until his election as lieutenant governor in 1924. He was also the secretary of the Louisiana constitutional convention of 1921. During his brief term as governor, Simpson opposed a toll bridge across the eastern portion of Lake Pontchartrain which was being built to connect New Orleans and Slidell in St. Tammany Parish. Simpson proposed instead that a free bridge to be built from Chef Menteur, but influential figures in New Orleans worked to authorize the toll bridge despite Simpson's objections. However, Simpson was able to start a free ferry service, which reduced the revenue to the toll bridge. The Speaker of the Louisiana House of Representatives during the Simpson administration was William Clark Hughes of Bossier Parish in northwestern Louisiana. The Ku Klux Klan reemerged during Simpson's term of office. Legislation was passed to outlaw hoods, masks, and robes excepting those worn during Mardi Gras and at masked balls or parties. The great flood in 1927 forced Simpson to order a \\"downriver cut\\" of the levee to protect New Orleans. Afterwards, the affected states of Louisiana, Arkansas, and Mississippi formed a tri-state flood control commission and worked together to secure federal aid for flood prevention. Property owners from the downriver parishes were compensated by the state for losses resulting from the levee cut. Two major candidates, Simpson and U.S. Representative Riley J. Wilson of Louisiana's 8th congressional district (Winn Parish), opposed Huey Long's election as governor. Long won by the largest margin in Louisiana Democratic primary history up until that time, 126,842 votes, compared to 81,747 for Wilson and 80,326 for Simpson. After his governorship, Simpson returned briefly in 1932 to his former position as secretary of the state senate. Simpson died of a heart seizure in New Orleans some two weeks after the election of Franklin D. Roosevelt as president. He was Methodist. He is interred at Greenwood Cemetery in New Orleans.

It is a historical town in the Bundelkhand region. Before 11 Feb 1995 Kulpahar was a Tehsil of Hamirpur District.Hamirpur Dist. website On 11 Feb 1995 Mahoba DistrictMahoba Dist. Website was carved out of Hamirpur, and Kulpahar is now a part of the Mahoba District. Kulpahar is the largest Subdivision of Uttar Pradesh. Kulpahar is known for its closeness to Khajuraho and other historic places like Mahoba, Charkhari, Kalinjar Rath, Orchha, and Jhansi. This town holds relics of temples and man-made water bodies of the Chandela Dynasty Origin of the name Historians have different theories about the origin of its name, primarily there are two opinions about the name. i. Two village theory - According to the Imperial gazetteer of United Province of Agra and Oudh -1909 there were two different villages Kulhua and paharia which later jointly became the town of Kulpahar; even the folklore says the same. It doesn't have any supporting evidence for the theory; it seems that the British writer of the gazetteer went by the folklore. ii. Second theoryWarrior Ascetics and Indian Empires is based on some historical facts dating back early 17th century. There was a cult gossainGazzetteer in the central India and one of the descendant of the followers of this cult Himmat Bahadur GossainBook author W. Pinch who actively took part in Indian freedom struggle was born in Kulpahar and Kulpahar had connection with this cult since the origin of the cult. Gossain cult is believed to be originated/started from Kulpahar. Historians who relate Kulpahar with the gossain cult gave the theory that Kulpahar word is composed of two words Kula and pahar means Clan mountain. Some relates it with a tantrik rite Kaula Tantra. Kulpahar was a site to perform secret tantrik rituals of gossain cult on a hill near Gahra lake; hence the town got its name Kaula pahar which as the time passed became Kulpahar. History Kulpahar was the capital of a princely state of the same name in British India. Kulpahar was founded in 1700 by Raja Jagat RajImperial Gazetteer of India of Jaitpur son of Maharaja Chhatrasal, and was reorganized by Senapati, a Bundela Rajput who was the son of Raja Jagat Raj of Jaitpur grandson of Maharaja Chhatrasal. Kulpahar was captured by the British in 1804, and became a princely state in the Bundelkhand Agency of the Central India Agency. The chief resided at the town of Nowgong in Madhya Pradesh. The fort of Kulpahar, situated on a steep hill, towers more than 800 ft (244 m) above the sea level, and contains the ruins of elaborately carved sculptures. Brief history of Kulpahar is covered under the section of origin. Not much information is available about the medieval and ancient history of Kulpahar but the remains of structures dating back 9th and 10th century confirms the existence and importance of Kulpahar in the ancient and medieval India. After the Mughals' fall and the rise of Chhatrasal Bundela, Kulpahar passed under his sway but failed to acquire and kind of pre-eminence. In the 17th century Chhatrasal declared independence and put a stiff resistance against Aurangzeb. He established a Bundella Principality and Bahadur Shah Moghal had to confirm all his acquisitions in the area called 'Bundelkhand'. There was a revival of hostilities during the region of reign of Farrukhsiyar when his general Mohammed Khan Bangash invaded Bundelkhand in the year 1729 AD and the aged ruler Chatrasal had to seek aid from Peshwa Baji rao. His 'Maratha'army of 70,000 men dashed from Indore (Malwa) and encamped at Mahoba. They surrounded forces of nawab Banghash who had captured Jaitpur, Belatal, Mudhari and Kulpahar etc. The Peshwa inflicted a crushing defeat over the Nawab by annihilating his forces in the dense forests of Jaitpur, Mudhari and Salat near Kulpahar. In return for this help, Chhatrasal bequeathed one third of his dominion to the Maratha Chieftain. That part included Mahoba, Shri Nagar, Jaitpur, Kulpahar etc. Later, under the treaty Bessien in 1803 AD the marathas ceded Bundelkhand area to British rulers. Its administration was, however, carried over by the subedar of Jalaun until 1858 AD when it was finally annexed by the East India Company. Kulpahar was made the headquarters of a Tehsil under the sub-division of Mahoba in the district of Hamirpur.

Granite mining in Kulpahar Chandela period well Kulpahar region comprises areas which are essentially covered by grey, pink, red granitic rock and black dolerite. The rocks are generally medium to coarse to very coarse grained, having variegated colours with varying textural patterns. In geological nomenclature they can be classified on the basis of colour, grain size and texture. Over half of the areas identified so far appear suitable for extracting blocks of two cubic meters in size from the surface outcrops. The granite with red feldspar having presence of white and bluish quartz has become popular in national and international markets during the last 10 years. The remaining outcrops would be suited for blocks of smaller size. Ruby red granite is good in quality and is popular in national and international markets. In granitic terrain the rocks may occur in the form of widespread sheets exposed above the ground level, in the form of hillocks, as high ground or below the ground under soil cover. They may also occur as boulders of different size and shapes spread over the sheet rock. They may be found as dykes, particularly of black and green types, as long narrow ridges often concealed beneath the surface. A major part of granite deposits in these regions are underground and have to be extracted by open cast mining. Underground granite block is more compact and require sophisticated and specialised machinery which adds to the cost of mining.

Life and career Gambart was born in Kortrijk, the son of a printer, binder and bookseller. By the age of 19, he had moved to Paris where he established his own print and papermaking business. He soon became known to the well- established Goupil print publishers, for whom he moved to England in 1840 to establish a branch in London. He soon struck out on his own again in 1842, this time in partnership with one Mr. Junin, to form the company Gambart & Junin which specialised in the import of art prints from Europe. The company was a success, and by early in 1844, the company was established as publishers as well as importers and exporters. =Art publisher= Gambart soon gained a reputation as a leading publisher of fine art prints. He established fair and mutually beneficial agreements with most of the best known British and European artists of the mid-Victorian period, including Edwin Landseer, John Everett Millais, Rosa Bonheur, Lawrence Alma-Tadema, William Holman Hunt, John Linnell, J. M. W. Turner, David Roberts, Frederick Goodall, Dante Gabriel Rossetti, Ford Madox Brown and William Powell Frith. He was a friend to many of these artists, and helped establish the reputation of some. For example, in 1855, he brought Rosa Bonheur to England with her monumental piece, The Horse Fair, which he purchased and which she showed to Queen Victoria at Windsor Castle in a private audience. For the same visit, he arranged a sojourn to Scotland where Bonheur made sketches for later works. He published many of her paintings as steel engraved reproductions. Through his efforts, she became better known in England than her native France. Gambart discovered Sir Lawrence Alma-Tadema who may have been the most successful painter of the Victorian era. The Dutch-born Alma-Tadema benefited in a similar manner ten years later. He met Gambart in 1864 and Gambart was impressed by the young man's work. Gambart arranged an exhibition in London in 1865 and promoted his work while the artist remained in Belgium.Art Renewal Alma-Tadema finally moved to London in 1870. Gambart worked with some of the finest engravers and technicians of his day to create works as close to the artist's intent as possible in a black and white medium. Among the craftsmen he employed were Charles George Lewis. Gambart later also employed colour lithography.George Glazer His attention to quality paid off both in the arrangements he maintained with leading artists (his career lasted 25 years) and also in sales. Among his best selling reproductions were William Holman Hunt's The Light of the World (1858), an inspiring and highly influential image of Christ, and William Powell Frith's The Derby Day (1858). =Original works= Arab Horses by Pierre-Jules M√™ne (1851).Gambart expanded into original works by 1849. By now established with an address in London's Pall Mall, his first exhibition was the bronzes of Pierre-Jules M√®ne, sculptor of animals. In time, his exhibitions, often featuring French artists, became known as the French Gallery and artists coveted an appearance on the gallery walls. Later moving to King Street, St. James, Gambart would alternate British artists with those of Continental European ones. He was among the first to sell art in this way. Prior to his galleries, most fine art was sold by the artist directly to the buyer, who was often a patron. His friendship with artists and buyers, including pen-maker and well-known patron Joseph Gillott, as well as with critics, would become a model for how modern art business would be run. He was among the top three dealers in London at a time when art was in high demand. His competitors were Agnew and Colnaghi.Albion Gallery =Personal life= Gambart's home in Nice, called Les Palmiers. It now houses the municipal archives of the city of Nice.Gambart became a British subject in 1846. He was married three times but he had no children. His third wife, Annie (1835‚Äì1870), was 16 years old when he married her. His London home was called \\"Rosenstead\\" in Avenue Road near Regent's Park. There, he and Annie gave lavish parties that were the talk of the London scene. He eventually sold Rosenstead to his friend and artist Frederick Goodall. Gambart retired a wealthy man in 1870 and passed the business on to his nephew, L√©on Henri Lef√®vre who continued to run it under the name of Pilgeram & Lef√®vre. The Lefevre Gallery at 30 Bruton Street, London, survived until 2002. Gambart and his wife moved to Nice where they had a marble palace, known as \\"Les Palmiers\\", built to his specifications. He was the Spanish Consul-General in Nice. His remaining link to his native Belgium was a summer chateau at Spa. He died in Nice in 1902. Avenue Gambart in Nice (a small cul-de-sac boulevard de Cambrai) was named for him. Honours * Member of the Royal Victorian Order (1898).

He is known as the \\"first citizen\\" of Nashville, Tennessee. Hunter and entrepreneur Demonbreun's great-grandfather, Pierre Boucher, was the first Canadian to be raised to the rank of nobility. His father, Etienne, served in the French army in Canada during the French and Indian War, the North American front of the Seven Years' War. After his country, France, was beaten in the Battle of the Plains of Abraham in Canada in 1759, Jacques- Timothee Boucher at the age of 28 migrated south to the British colonies, what became the United States, and got into the fur trade. Preferring the simple life of a trapper and hunter, he dropped the noble title, adapting it in an anglicization as his new surname, Demonbreun. He had begun traveling to the Middle Tennessee area in the 1760s while in his 30s. In 1766, while hunting near the muddy water at the mouth of a small creek entering the Cumberland River in the region called French Lick, Demonbreun noticed a large number of buffalo and deer using a salt lick. The spring is a natural source of sulfurated water, and eventually became known as Sulphur Dell. He lived in a cave there for several months until he could build a cabin near the river to use as his home base for fur trapping. Demonbreun made frequent trips to the early Nashville settlement to engage in fur trading with local Native Americans. When James Robertson and the Watauga settlers established Fort Nashborough in 1778, they were surprised and relieved to find that Demonbreun, a white man, was thriving there. Military service Demonbreun joined the George Rogers Clark expedition and received an appointment as lieutenant governor in command of the Northwest Territory. He settled at Fort Kaskaskia in the Illinois Country, where he served as lieutenant governor from 1783-1786. In 1786 he resigned from military service and soon thereafter moved permanently to Nashville. Family Demonbreun traveled extensively, and managed two careers and two families. He fulfilled his duties as lieutenant governor of the Illinois Territory and maintained a family in Kaskaskia. Demonbreun had five children by his wife, Therese Archange Gibault, in Illinois. During his time in Nashville, he took a mistress named Elizabeth Bennett and had three children by her: Polly (Cagle); William; and John Baptiste Demonbreun. . In his will, he mentions three of his legal children by name: Agnes Doza, Julia Johnson, and Timothy DeMonbreun. He specifically lists children William, John, and Polly as illegitimate (or natural). He does not mention the mother of either family of children, nor his son Felix,Demonbreun will, Rootsweb US GenWeb, Davidson Co, TN wills though Felix Demonbreun is well documented through census and other records. According to Felix's grandson, Samuel, Felix was removed from Timothy's will because he elected to become a Baptist minister against the wishes of his father who was French Catholic. Later life Eventually, Demonbreun developed a thriving mercantile and fur trading business in the Nashville area with seventeen employees. By 1800 his mercantile business on Nashville's Public Square advertised such items as window glass, paper, cured deer hides, and buffalo tongues. An 1809 newspaper advertisement announced that he was opening a tavern, also on the Public Square. The Revolutionary French hero, Marquis de Lafayette, visited Nashville on May 4, 1825, during his farewell tour of the United States. Andrew Jackson presided over a banquet in his honor at the Nashville Inn. Jacques-Timoth√©e, or Timothy Demonbreun, by then very elderly, conversed with the Marquis in their native French. When he died in 1826, Demonbreun divided his substantial fortune among his children. Historical records and memorials No record of the burial site of Nashville's \\"First Citizen\\" survived. He was most likely buried at Nashville City Cemetery but early records no longer exist. A historical marker at the northwest corner of Third Avenue North and Broadway, in the city, marks the site of his home. In 1996 a monument sculpted by Alan LeQuire to honor Demonbreun was erected near Fort Nashborough, overlooking the Cumberland River in downtown Nashville. Demonbreun Street, named for him, crosses Interstate 40 in downtown Nashville. A monument has been erected in honor of Timothy Demonbreun at Carney Cemetery in Ashland City, Tennessee, but historians do not believe he was buried there. At the time of his death, this was the farm of his past mistress Elizabeth Bennett, and her husband Joseph Duratt. Name Because French orthography was so fluid at the time, and because of widespread variations in English orthography, the spelling and version of Demonbreun's name is of some debate. The preferred use today is Timothy Demonbreun, though the first name is sometimes rendered in the French as Timoth√©, Timoth√©e or Timothe. As for the last name, it derives from the French words, de (of) mont (mount) bruen (brown) for of mount brown, and is also rendered variously as Demontbrun, de Montbrun, Demontbreun, de Montbreun, De Mont-Breun, De Monbrun, and others. Descendants of Demonbreun (it is a very common surname in Middle Tennessee) spell the name with and without the middle \\"T,\\" as one word or two, with a \\"U\\" in place of the \\"O,\\" with and without the \\"E,\\" and with an \\"N\\" or an \\"M\\" at the end. In addition, other variations such as Demumbrine and \\"Demombrum\\" also exist. Demonbreun Street in Nashville shows the preferred spelling.

History Newville was founded by John Frederick Herring, and was platted in December 1823. It is situated upon section three, Worthington Township. Abraham Nye was one of the first settlers there, and was instrumental in inducing Mr. Herring to lay out the town. Newville lies in a small valley at the confluence of Slater's Run with the Clearfork of the Mohican River, nearly surrounded by tree-covered hills. A photo of Newville from 1937 In 1811-12, John Frederick Herring built the second grist mill in Richland County. This mill was situate on the Clearfork, four miles west of Bellville, in what is now Perry township. Peter Weirick was employed to do the carpenter work, and while he was erecting the building, Mr. Herring drove to Baltimore with a six- horse team to procure burrs, wheels and gearings for the mill. The round trip from this part of Ohio to Baltimore and return was then made by team and occupied about two months‚Äô time. Now the same distance can be traveled in fewer hours than the days required then. After operating this mill for several years, Mr. Herring sold the same to Francis Baughman in 1815. In 1833, Mr. Baughman disposed of this property to John Hanawalt, who operated the same for about fifty years, and the mill is known in history as ‚ÄúHanawalt‚Äôs.‚Äù This mill stood where the Lexington and Fredericktown road crosses the Clearfork. The building is now used as a barn. John Hanawalt was the father of J. L. Hanawalt of South Main Street, Mansfield. After selling the mill west of Bellville, Mr. Herring entered another millsite, also on the Clearfork, fifteen miles down the stream, where he erected his second grist mill, and a few years later laid out the town of Newville. The first settlers in Newville and vicinity were John Frederick Herring, Abraham Nye, Michael Hogan, Daniel Carpenter, George Armentrout and Luther Richard. Abraham Nye was the first tavern keeper, Daniel Stoner the first blacksmith and Michael Hogan the first merchant. Newville was named after Newville, Pennsylvania, the native place of the founder of the town. At the time Newville was laid out, the volume of water in the Clearfork of the Mohican was larger than it is now, and the pioneers were wont to found towns along streams of water, for mill-power and other purposes. Great things and a bright future were predicted for the town, but the hopes entertained for its future greatness were never realized in the scramble for new counties back in the ‚Äúforties.‚Äù Newville had hopes of becoming a county-seat town, but did not. To add further to disappointments as to future prosperity, the two railroads that were built through the southern part of the county left Newville about midway between them, the B&O; at Butler, four miles to the southwest, and the Pennsylvania at Perrysville, four miles to the east. This being a railroad age, towns off the paths of the iron horse seldom thrive, and Newville has been no exception to the general rule. The early settlers of the Newville country came, mostly, along the old Wyandot trail, following up the Mohican and its Clearfork to Newville. Some of the later arrivals came along the Portage road - a military road cut through by a portion of General Harrison‚Äôs army in 1812. This road runs diagonally across Worthington township from the northeast to southwest. This was probably the first road in the township, and although it has been changed in certain places to conform to local conditions, it is still a public highway. =Preaching= The decade between 1825 and 1835 was a preaching period at Newville, such as no other town in the county ever passed through. Men preached according to their own views of the scriptures without regard to what any denomination taught or believed, all agreeing, however, upon Anabaptist lines. They were out-comers from various sects, and in time organized new ones. The most prominent among these preachers were the Rigdons - Sydney and Thomas, both gifted men and orators of great power. Sydney Rigdon, it has been claimed, was one of the most charming and convincing speakers of that olden time when there were orators in the land. For several years he was a minister of the Disciples, as was also his brother Thomas. Later Sydney became a Mormon elder, and took a number of converts from the southern part of this county with him to Nauvoo. In time, an estrangement sprang up between Brigham Young and Mr. Rigdon, resulting in the withdrawal of the latter, who returned to the east, where he died in 1875, aged eighty-three years. Notwithstanding the early promulgation of different views, the M. E. church is the only one that has been able to maintain an existence as a religious body in Newville. Worthington Township, in which Newville is situated, was the banner township in the camp-meeting line, in the days of the popularity of such gatherings. Of the several camp- meeting sites, the one called ‚ÄúEasterly‚Äôs‚Äù two miles west of Newville, was the most popular and the best known. The meetings were under the auspices of the United Brethren denomination. Perhaps, also, by the Evangelicals, commonly called the ‚ÄúAlbrights.‚Äù In these camp-meeting gatherings, social cordiality was blended with religious zeal. Fervor along religious lines was more intense and demonstrative a half-century ago than it is today. A man was expected to shout to show his zeal and attest his spirituality. It is different now. The camp-meeting preachers believed, as a rule, that ‚Äúwhere the spirit of God is, there is liberty.‚Äù And aside from the general supervision of the prayer meetings, they did not attempt to control the boisterous element around them. Thus the meetings seldom got far advanced before men and women were praying, groaning and singing together. Some were groaning on account of their sins, some praying for their companions, others singing and shouting because they felt happy, and a few would swoon from physical exhaustion. A horse-back procession of religious enthusiasts, returning from a camp-meeting, was heard approaching by a poorly-clad woman working in a field near to the roadside. It was a sound of music - of men‚Äôs and women‚Äôs voices mingling harmoniously together in sacred song. Abashed, she hid herself behind a tree, but peeped around as the procession passed by. To the unseen observer, the countenance of the leader‚Äôs wife seemed lighted up like the face of a glorified saint. Her bonnet hung by its ribbons down her back, and her auburn hair floated like waves of golden sheen over her shoulders, forming a beautiful, living, moving picture. =People= The Honorable Samuel J. Kirkwood was one of the first school-teachers of the village. Mr. Kirkwood read law, became prosecuting attorney of Richland county, and after the close of his term, removed to Iowa, became governor of that state; was later a senator in the congress of the United States and closed his official career as a member of the Garfield cabinet. Major Hogan was a scholar and a gentleman, more devoted to his books then to his business interests. Dr. J. P. Henderson, who passed nearly all his life in Newville, was a close student and much devoted to archaeological researches. Joseph Musgrave, once a Newville merchant, was a state senator from the Ashland district in 1856-57\\\\. The late Major George F. Carpenter, lawyer and banker, was a son of the Daniel Carpenter, the promoter of the early business interests of Newville. Major Carpenter was one of the charter members of the Richland County Historical society and its first vice president. The Governor John Peter Altgeld was for several years a Newville boy. As a man, in after years, he became a noted jurist, an eloquent orator and a great leader among men. =Business= Daniel Carpenter, father of W. B. Carpenter, of Mansfield, was one of the principal promoters of the business and industrial interests of Newville. He had a store of general merchandise and founded and operated a tannery and an ashery. Baltimore was the market place for this part of the country at that time and the journey to and from - a round-trip distance of a thousand miles - had to be made with wagon teams, part of the journey was over mountain roads. Grain was too bulky, heavy and low-priced to haul so far to market. Ginseng, maple sugar and beeswax were the principal marketable articles and they were not all-year-round products. To further the business interests of the town, Daniel Carpenter founded an ‚Äúashery,‚Äù and manufactured another exportable commodity - pearl ash. His teams traversed the country for miles around, buying ashes of the farmers, thus adding to their meager income. Among the early industries, was pennyroyal distilleries, dotted here and there over the pennyroyal regions of Ohio. Pennyroyal grew in profusion in the southern part of the country in the earliest days. It is a deciduous, herbaceous plant, aromatic, with a pungent taste. As this was a rare and peculiar industry, a brief description of the process of distillation may be of interest to the reader. The pennyroyal after being gathered, was allowed to wilt until it would pack well, and was then tramped down carefully in a steam chest until it was full. The oil is in small globules on the under side of the leaf. When set free by steam, it passed into a condenser, into which a small stream of cold water was conducted. After being condensed, it was poured into an oil vat, nearly filled with water. The oil being lighter than the water, ran into the vessel and passed out into a receiver. Pennyroyal oil is used for its medicinal properties, and was thought by the pioneers to be valuable as a carminative remedy. The last pennyroyal distillery in this part of the county was Fisher‚Äôs at Palmyra, five miles south of Bellville. At the Fisher distillery, essence of peppermint was also distilled. Distilleries are often called ‚Äústill-houses.‚Äù And upon this play of words, Comrade Ricksicker [Ricksecker], of Galion, tells a good anecdote in his indubitable way, at Grand Army reunions. As the story goes, a revenue officer was trying to ferret out illicit distilleries in Kentucky during the later part of the civil war. He had not been successful, and being anxious to show results, approached a tipsy soldier, an Irishman, and inquired after ‚Äúprivate stills,‚Äù as the illicit distilleries are called. But Paddy didn‚Äôt seem to have any information to give out. Then the detective offered him a ten-dollar bill, whereupon Paddy admitted having certain knowledge about several private stills and offered to conduct the officer to one, but the money must be paid in advance. This having been done, Paddy escorted the detective though forests and over hills, and finally coming upon a camp of soldiers, they halted. The officer demanded an explanation. An Irishman never gives away a friend, even though he should be a ‚Äúmoonshiner.‚Äù Paddy called the officer‚Äôs attention to a soldier who was sitting by a tree, and said: ‚ÄúThat man is of a good family, and enlisted with high hopes of being made a general within a short time. But now, after two years‚Äô service, he is a ‚Äúprivate still.‚Äù Abandonment In the 1940s, the U.S. Corps of Engineers built a dam on the Mohican river, that would under some circumstances, cause the town to be flooded, and it was ordered abandoned. Some of the foundations and buildings are still standing in the forest just west of the lake.

Ultimately the album failed to gain much attention outside of their cult following. Several bizarre altercations between the band and their devotees led to the band formally disbanding in 1983.

OPtion, p.13 *Untune the Sky, Las Vegas, Nevada - This album is chock full of scary stuff! These brothers from the desolate and incredibly boring Fallon, Nevada have produced some pretty demented and diverse music using whatever instruments and line-up that sounded best at the time. They seem driven by an environment that includes a dead animal disposal site, haunted cemeteries, child molesters and serial killers. This album has \\"festered\\" on me. I first dismissed it as pseudo intellectual pud-whacking‚ÄìI now embrace it as one of the best albums of the decade. *Artitude Magazine, New York City - Recorded in a haunted house located somewhere in the Nevada desert, these songs are both trashy and serious. Concerned mostly with the topics of death and fear in a somewhat overstated manner, this is saved by its sense of humor and by its relative sincerity. The humor comes in the way that the main themes are repeated in each song - hence the sincerity, in the group's single-mindedness. The music itself is somewhat-trashy, grating rock, sometimes sounding strangely normal and sometimes a bit more unconventional. *Cause and Effect, Indianapolis, Indiana - The newest release by Theatre of Ice further refines their doom-gloom horror-rock sound.

Unsound, p.56 *Wild Planet, Nebraska - B-movie gloom and doom splatter rock! Unlike a lot of groups in this genre, Theatre of Ice don't sound derivative, and their sound is varied, ranging from bleak industrial soundscapes to moody post punk. Sure, there are obvious influences, Siouxsie, Chrome, Suicide, Throbbing Gristle, Velvet Underground and others. But Theatre of Ice takes these influences and distle them into their own distinctive sound. Beyond the Graves of Passion is simultaneously the scarier and the more accessible of their two albums, the sound has been refined and even includes some haunting (sorry) melodies, even some spacey synth pieces. A must for fans of the macabre! *SPAMM, Sacramento, California - This album is much more evolved than The Haunting. It seems as though Theatre of Ice now not only know what they want to do, but they can also transform those ideas into music. Music that hints of industrial throb, maniac hardcore, rough edged pop, and just plain weird shit. Once again, as with their prior release, you have to be kinda warped to truly appreciate such assaults to the mind. Great! *Factsheet Five, Massachusetts - Imagine 4 brothers in Nevada. The Johnson boys are into horror and music. They think fear is God's gift to mankind. So what do they do? They start a band and make some of the scariest music ever. Whether you call this, industrial or horror rock, the point is that these guys do it well, and are more accessible to the average listener than most industrial music.

The mostly Muslim western parts of the old Punjab became Pakistan's West Punjab, later renamed as Punjab Province, while the mostly Hindu and Sikh eastern parts went to India. History =Partition of India= With the partition of the British Indian Empire, the Punjab province was to be divided in two as per the Indian Independence Act passed by the parliament of the United Kingdom. The province as constituted under the Government of India Act 1935 ceased to exist and two new provinces were to be constituted, to be known respectively as West Punjab & East Punjab. The princely states of the Punjab region (which had not been British possessions, so could not be partitioned by the British) all (except Bahawalpur (princely state), which acceded to Dominion of Pakistan) acceded to the new Dominion of India and were combined into the Patiala and East Punjab States Union (PEPSU). The northeast Hill States of the Punjab Province banded together and were declared a union territory in 1950 as Himachal Pradesh. =Renaming of the state= Administrative divisions of India in 1951 The Constitution of India, which came into effect in 1950, renamed the province of \\"East Punjab\\" as the state of \\"Punjab\\". =Reorganisation of Indian States= In 1956, the PEPSU was merged into an expanded Punjab state. =Punjabi Suba Movement= A map of the distribution of native Punjabi speakers in India and Pakistan With effect from 1 November 1966, there was yet another reorganisation, this time on linguistic lines, when the state of Punjab as constituted in 1956 was divided into three: the mostly Hindi-speaking part became the present-day Indian state of Haryana and the mostly Punjabi-speaking part became the present-day Punjab,S. Gajrani, History, Religion and Culture of India (2004), p. 217 while a new union territory (Chandigarh) was also created, to serve as a capital to both states.

As a member of the order, he lived at Baslein in 1328, at Villingen in 1336, and at Lindau from 1343 onwards.

Valuable Knowledge The chronicle is a source of information on the first half of the fourteenth century, and gives an idea of the conflicts which arose between the cities and the nobles of Upper Swabia. They also provide a general view of events in the empire, especially of Louis the Bavarian's conduct toward the papacy and of the Franciscan Order's attitude toward the controversies. John was a man of culture, well-versed in spiritual and in secular literature, but he frequently showed great credulity, and took delight in reporting the observations of others, which has made his work of such great value for medievalists.

The Concert Spirituel took place on the second floor of the central pavilion. The Concert Spirituel was one of the first public concert series in existence. The concerts began in Paris in 1725 and ended in 1790; later, concerts or series of concerts of the same name occurred in Paris, Vienna, London and elsewhere. The series was founded to provide entertainment during the Easter fortnight and on religious holidays when the other spectacles (the Paris Opera, Com√©die-Fran√ßaise, and Com√©die-Italienne) were closed. The programs featured a mixture of sacred choral works and virtuosic instrumental pieces, and for many years took place in a magnificently- decorated Salle des Cent Suisses (Hall of the Hundred Swiss Guards) in the Tuileries Palace. They started at six o‚Äôclock in the evening and were primarily attended by well-to-do bourgeois, the lower aristocracy, and foreign visitors. In 1784 the concerts were moved to the stage area of the Salle des Machines (an enormous former opera house in the Tuileries), and in 1790, when the royal family was confined in the Tuileries, they took place in a Paris theater. Original series (1725‚Äì1790) The first concert took place of 18 March 1725 where two of Delalande's motets and Corelli's Christmas Concerto were performed. The series was managed by a succession of director- entrepreneurs, who paid a license fee in order to obtain a royal privilege which granted them an exception to the monopoly on public performance of music held by the Paris Opera (Acad√©mie Royale de Musique). The first director was Anne Danican Philidor, brother of the composer and chess master Fran√ßois-Andr√© Danican Philidor. Philidor went bankrupt within two years. His successors, Pierre Simart and Jean-Joseph Mouret (1728‚Äì1733), expanded the operation with a series of \\"French Concerts,\\" but met the same unhappy fate. Poster advertising the Concert Spirituel to be held on 15 August 1754 Because no one was willing to take their place, the series was administered by the Acad√©mie Royale de Musique for the next fourteen years (1734‚Äì1748). During this period, the works of French composers (particularly Michel-Richard Delalande, Mouret, and Jean-Joseph de Mondonville) were favoured, although Italian works were never entirely absent. The series was finally profitable because the Acad√©mie did not have to pay the license fee, but in general this was a period of stagnation. Two new entrepreneurs, Joseph-Nicolas-Pancrace Royer, and Gabriel Capperan (1748‚Äì1762), purchased the privilege, redecorated the concert hall, augmented the size of the orchestra and chorus, and set out to make their fortunes. They continued to perform new and existing French works, but also presented the most famous Italian singers. Beginning in 1755, oratorios with French texts were introduced and became popular. The series was soon profitable. In 1762 a well-connected royal functionary, Antoine Dauvergne, forced Royer's widow out of the operation she had run since her husband's death in 1755. Dauvergne and various associates managed the concerts until 1773. The interest of the public was excited by adding a motet competition and by expanding the presentation of instrumental virtuosi beyond violinists to include masters of wind instruments. Although the concerts remained profitable, Dauvergne abandoned the concerts. As a result, the Acad√©mie replaced him with Pierre Gavini√®s, Simon Le Duc and Fran√ßois Joseph Gossec (1773‚Äì1777). Joseph Le Gros ¬´Directeur du Concert Spirituel¬ª Drawing by Charles-Nicolas Cochin From 1777 the Concert Spirituel was directed by Joseph Legros, its last and most brilliant director. Legros, a star singer at the Opera, who managed the concerts until they came to an end in 1790 with the French Revolution. He attracted the most famous performers in Europe and renewed the repertoire, eliminating 17th-century grand motets and replacing them with works by Johann Christian Bach, Wolfgang Amadeus Mozart (the Paris Symphony in 1778), Joseph Haydn, whose symphonies were on nearly every program, and others. Mozart composed his Sinfonia Concertante for Four Winds K297b for performance at the Concert Spirituel but this was dropped from the programme and never performed. The final concert took place on 13 May 1790. The 19th century During the Napoleonic period concerts were occasionally held in Paris under the title \\"concert spirituel\\", particularly after 1805 as religious feeling revived in France. During the Restoration (1814‚Äì1830), the Th√©√¢tre-Italien and Acad√©mie Royale de Musique gave 6 to 9 concerts spirituels per year, but only during Holy Week. They became a regular feature at the Soci√©t√© des Concerts du Conservatoire shortly after it was founded in 1828 and remained so for most of the nineteenth century.

The society became a limited liability company in the 1930s and purchased a number of independent department stores during the 1950s and 1960s. In 1973 the Army and Navy Stores group was acquired by House of Fraser. In 2005 the remaining Army & Navy stores (the flagship store located on Victoria Street in London and stores in Camberley, and Chichester) were refurbished and re-branded under the House of Fraser nameplate. House of Fraser itself was acquired by Icelandic investment company, Baugur Group, in late 2006, and then by Sports Direct on the 10 August 2018. The Victoria Street department store, trading as House of Fraser in 2019, is situated within the City of Westminster, to the south of St. James's Park. It is the only department store to trade in the locality. Each of its four selling- floors holds a broad range of merchandise including clothing, accessories and cosmetics, furnishing, household and electrical goods. 'World of Food', a new food hall concept in House of Fraser stores (introduced at Birmingham in 2003), was opened on the Ground Floor to coincide with the store's relaunch under the 'House of Fraser' name but has since closed. History Army & Navy Co-operative society shareholder's ticket Victoria Store as House of Fraser on the right Victoria store as House of Fraser on the left The Army & Navy Co- operative Society Ltd. was incorporated on 15 September 1871, being formed by a group of army and navy officers. The aim of the co-operative was to supply goods to its members at the lowest remunerative rates, and was based on two earlier models ‚Äì the Civil Service Supply Association and the Civil Service Co-operative Society. The society leased part of a distillery premises in Victoria Street, London which was owned by Vickers & Co, and by February 1872 a store for the sale of groceries was opened on the site. By 1873, the store offered stationery, drapery, fancy goods, tailoring, groceries, a chemist and even a guns department. The store proved too small for the growing business so the founding members rented a house next to their existing warehouse and acquired a further warehouse in Johnson Place. By 1876, the business had again outgrown its premises. They leased more of the distillery from Vickers, closed their warehouse in Johnson Place moving to a new location at Ranelagh Road in Pimlico. The business was now offering a banking department to its members, and had negotiated an option on the site as part of the lease deal at Victoria Street. This option was taken up in 1878, allowing for the purchase of part of the Victoria Street premises. A refreshments room was added to the store for its growing customer base. The store also expanded internationally by opening offices in Paris and Leipzig. The business continued to expand, and in 1881 the society purchased the remaining distillery and associated buildings. In the following months departments were opened covering the entire site. In addition, warehousing was moved to Tooley Street in Westminster, with the Pimlico site now operating as a manufacturing centre for tailoring and printing. Printing had been carried out in-house since 1877. Further workshop space was purchased in Johnson Street, and offices in Howick Place were converted into selling space. By this time the business had added furniture sales and an estate agency to its operations. The society continued to grow, so new locations were added. In 1890 stores were opened in Plymouth, and Bombay, India, while in 1891 a further store was opened in Karachi. This Indian adventure continued with stores opening in Calcutta in 1900, while stores in New Delhi, Shimla and Ranchi were opened in the 1930s. The society still continued to expand in London, erecting a new preserved provisions factory in Coburg Road, and purchasing more property along Victoria Street. The society offered an enormous illustrated price list which could be ordered by phone. However the advent of the First World War saw trade suffer badly, but this was supplanted in part by a contract from the War Office. After the war, the society was hit by strikes by its staff, but it continued to develop its Victoria Street site and by 1922 a new frontage had been added. The last surviving member of the original board, Captain Ernest Lewis, died on 3 April 1926. He was joint managing director and treasurer until he retired in July 1914 after 43 years with the society.The Times, Thursday 29 April 1926; pg. 25 One of his sons was Donald Swain Lewis, senior officer, who died in the Royal Flying Corps in 1916. In 1934, the society was incorporated into a limited company ‚Äì Army & Navy Stores Ltd. The Army and Navy Stores Limited 'General Price list 1935-36' listed showrooms and offices at 105 Victoria Street, Francis Street and Howick Place, Westminster SW1. Depots were listed in Union Street, Plymouth, Devon and in India at Esplanade Road, Bombay and Chowringhee, Calcutta. There was also a furniture depository and strong room at Turnham Green and an auction room at Greencoat Place SW1. The business was hit hard during the Second World War with both its sites at Turnham Green and Portsmouth suffering serious bomb damage, while its Plymouth depot was completely destroyed. Trading difficulties were further accentuated after the war when India gained independence in 1947. The last colonial store closed in Bombay in 1952. With the closure of branches overseas, plans turned to the expansion of the domestic business. The purchase of the first of a number of provincial department stores was made in 1953 with the acquisition of Genge & Co of Dorchester. This was swiftly followed by the purchase of William Harvey of Guildford in the same year. In 1955, the company added J D Morant of Chichester. Further purchases included Thomas Clarkson of Wolverhampton in 1960, Thomas White & Co of Aldershot in 1961, Burgis & Colbourne of Leamington Spa in 1963 and Parsons & Hart of Andover in 1965. The Bromley stores of Harrison Gibson were added to the group in 1968. It was not only acquisitions that money was being spent on ‚Äì a new store was built in Camberley in 1964 and branded under the William Harvey name, while the stores in Guildford, Chichester, Dorchester and Wolverhampton were given new extensions. Work on replacing the old Victoria Street store began in 1973. The new building was completed in 1977, designed by London architects Elsom Pack & Roberts.The Times, Monday 17 April 1972; pg. 24; Issue 58454 In 1973, Army and Navy Stores was purchased by House of Fraser.

Presentation It is characterized by new bone formation on the outside of the diaphyses of long bones of the limbs, without destruction of cortical bone. Symptoms include stiffness and warm, firm swelling of the legs, and signs of lung disease such as coughing and difficulty breathing. Hypertrophic osteopathy in humans differs from a similar condition in dogs, in that in humans it is usually caused by lung tumors or infections such as Mycobacterium fortuitum or Corynebacterium. The most common cause in dogs is primary or metastatic pulmonary neoplasia. Other potential causes in dogs include heartworm disease, heart disease, and pulmonary abscesses. It has also been associated with nonpulmonary diseases such as renal tumors and rhabdomyosarcoma of the bladder. At least once it has been caused by congenital megaesophagus in a six-year-old dog. Hypertrophic osteopathy is rare in cats. Causes One theory is that hypertrophic osteopathy is caused by increased blood flow to the ends of the legs, overgrowth of connective tissue, and then new bone formation surrounding the bones. This is secondary to nerve stimulation by the lung disease. The condition may reverse if the lung mass is removed or if the vagus nerve is cut on the affected side.

He was offered a reward of a car or a house, but requested that his reward be to make a record. The result was a 4-song EP on Electrecord, backed by a band put together by the record label for the purpose. However, the record was not a commercial success. After a brief attempt at being a lƒÉutar in Bucharest (where he lacked family connections), he retreated to Constan»õa, where he was more successful.Barrington; Friedrich In the mid-1970s, Stoican decided to try Bucharest again. In 1977, he managed to make another record on Electrecord, this time an LP with a band of his own choosing. Stoican and trumpeter Costel Vasilescu, taking full advantage of Stoican's prestige as a spy-catcher, if not as a violinist, pulled together an all-star band drawn from the Bucharest music scene of the time.Barrington, Friedrich Among others, the album features cimbalom player Toni Iordache, who was responsible for many of the arrangements, and accordionist Ionica Minune.Sole, Friedrich Other than Stoican and Iordache, the 14-piece band were credited only as a \\"People's Orchestra\\" rather than by name on the original Electrecord release, but a band photo on the album has allowed the line-up to be definitively identified. Deanne Sole describes it as \\"the kind of music he would have used to impress people who might hire him for their festivities\\", featuring hora dances and other music typical for wedding receptions, more restrained than \\"the Romani who were recorded more recently, in the post- Ceau»ôescu era\\", \\"indoor\\" music, \\"country dances urbanised by streets and walls,\\" but still with \\"the taut, sweet quality that makes Romanian folk violinists so compelling.\\" Besides horas, the album includes briu, s√Ærba, and geamparale dance numbers. The album, recorded when Stoican was already in his late forties, proved to be his belated ticket to prominence among Bucharest lƒÉutari. German record producer Henry Ernst of Asphalt Tango Records, who first heard Stoican's 1977 LP in 1986 in a small-town record store in Transylvania, began negotiations with Electrecord in 2002 to re-release it. The tapes proved difficult to find, but the album was finally released in 2005 as a CD entitled Ion Petre Stoican: Sounds from a bygone age, Volume. 1.Barrington, Sole Discography * 4 track EP, originally released on Electrecord, c. 1966, name unknown * album, originally released as an LP on Electrecord, c. 1977, ST-EPE 02166 'Ion Petre Stoican muzicƒÉ lƒÉutƒÉreascƒÉ', re- released 2005 as a CD on Asphalt Tango Records, as Ion Petre Stoican: Sounds from a bygone age, Volume. 1. =Credits for Ion Petre Stoican: Sounds from a bygone age, Volume. 1= ;Musicians :Ion Petre Stoican - violin :Nicu Sapteluni - violin :Marian Grigore - violin :Matei Niculescu - violin :Mihai \\"Rita\\" Gheorghe - double bass :Fane Negrila - doublebass :Ionica Minune - accordion :Viorel Fundament - accordion :Guta \\"Toi\\" Vasile - violin :Toni Iordache - cymbalom :Mieluta Bibescu - clarinet :Grigore Vasile - clarinet :Costel Vasilescu - trumpet :Nicu Manole - violin ;Tracks #Hora lui Sile 03:33 #Hora de la Constan≈£a 02:39 #Mo≈üule, te-a≈ü √Æntreba 04:36 #Hora de la Olteni≈£a 02:37 #Ia-ia-≈£i mireasƒÉ, ziua buna 08:33 #Hora lui Mihalea 02:32 #Chiar dacƒÉ dau de necaz 02:45 #Melodia lui Sile 02:15 #Hora lƒÉutareasca 03:11 #Briu din Olteni≈£a 01:45 #Hora de joc de la Olteni≈£a 01:39 #Hora 02:40 #S√Ærba de joc din Constan≈£a 02:35 #Hora de la Luceni 01:29 #S√Ærba 02:08 Notes References * Helen Barrington Review of Ion Petre Stoican: Sounds from a bygone age, Volume. 1, 23 January 2006, on the site of The World (radio program), a BBC program.

Published in 1999 by Knopf Canada, Summer Gone was a national bestseller in Canada. It was nominated for the Giller Prize, and won the Books in Canada First Novel Award. Plot summary The book deals with the life of Bailey Newling and his three lost summers. It tells the story of a divorced Bailey and his young son Caz, where on one fateful canoe trip, they share a remarkable night of truth and love. Macfarlane set this novel among the cottage country in northern Ontario, the Waubano Reaches. Bailey, nicknamed Bay, tells of the three summers in his life: the summer he was 12 and attended the camp where he met his camp instructor Peter Larkin, the summer where he, his wife Sarah and 6-year-old son rented a cottage near his old campsite and, the summer where he and his 12-year-old son shared their extraordinary night. Macfarlane uses a notable technique in the writing of Summer Gone, where he would start the story of one summer and drift into another. It may start with Bay telling of his tale at camp and then shift onto another thought which may have occurred decades later involving his wife or his son. This technique ties all of Bay's summer stories together into one when he tells it to his son. The narration of this story is told by Caz's half brother, from a one-night stand of Bailey's, as an adult, retelling what Caz had told him.

The city is the seat of Valandovo Municipality. History =Ancient Period= Evidence of life can be found beginning in the 10th-7th centuries B.C. There is a settlement known as Mal Konstantinopol (Small Constantinople) dating from Roman times, and the life in the Middle Ages is marked by Marco‚Äôs Tower. In the vicinity of the town there are also two very important archeological sites ‚Äì The Isar, Marvinci, and the knowledge experts have on the existence of the ancient city Idomenae. Also, very interesting and important discoveries are the ancient mosaics of Valandovo, the necropolis discovered near Dedeli dating from the Iron Age, the monastery and the church dedicated to St. George, etc. On the hill Isar, at the village of Marvinci near the town of Valandovo, there is a community from the early antique period that belonged to the southern Macedonian area called Amphacsitida (ŒëŒºœÜŒ±ŒæŒØœÑŒπœÇ) in Ancient Greek meaning \\"from both sides of Axios (river). The many layers of this community speak of permanence with no significant interruptions, where time managed to save the earliest traces of its existence. The hill is 40 to 45 meters high and is located over the mouth of Anska River, flowing into the Vardar river. The Acropolis of the town was strengthened by defence bulwarks. Most of the architectural findings show the existence of profane living objects, while the last phase shows the possible existence of a ceramic workshop. The construction method in the earlier primitive stages, is very different from the latest stages. According to the archeological findings, the town was first ruined in the 3rd century BC, in time of the Celtic invasion in 279 BC. The excavated construction material shows the cultural and economic development of the town throughout centuries of its survival. In the 5th and 4th century BC, stock was imported from Corinth and Ionia, in Asia Minor. Ceramic from the Iron Age was found in the tombs and Greek amphorae from the classical and late Hellenic period. Apart from the imported ceramics from the big manufacturing centers, there are also local ceramic products with native tradition and often simulating Greek forms. During the Hellenic era, the connections with the neighbouring leading cultural centres in Macedonia: Pela, Beroia, Amphipolis and Thessalonica were strengthened. Ceramic plastic, jewels and coins were made in the pattern of these developed centres. The antique town on the Isar secured its economic development through agriculture, cattle raising and mining. The numerous mines in the region, as well as the pottery craft continued as a tradition in the Roman period. =Modern Period= In the late 19th and early 20th century, Valandovo was part of the Salonica Vilayet of the Ottoman Empire. In 1913, as a result of the Balkan Wars, the town became a part of the Kingdom of Serbia, which in 1918 joined the Kingdom of the Serbs, Croats and Slovenes. From 1929 to 1941 Valandovo was part of the Vardar Banovina of the Kingdom of Yugoslavia. From 1941 to 1944, during the Axis occupation of Yugoslavia, Valandovo, as most of Vardar Macedonia, was annexed by the Kingdom of Bulgaria. Geography and Climate Having an ideal Mediterranean climate, the town and its surroundings give the impression of a large garden abundant with the well-known and tasty Valandovo figs and pomegranates, as well as other early-spring vegetables and fruits. Population and Ethnicities According to the census performed in 2002,2002 census results in English and Macedonian (PDF) the population of the municipality of Valandovo is 11,890 inhabitants. The ethnic structure of the population living in the Valandovo is: *Macedonians: 9,830 (82.67%) *Turks: 1,333 (11.21%) *Romani: 32 (0.27%) *Serbs: 639 (5.37%) *Bosniaks: 1 *Vlachs: 1 *Others: 52 (0.45%) Music Festival Town center of Valandovo Valandovo is known for its annual music festival in which the best folk singers from Macedonia take part. The first festival started as a result of the continuity of the rich and long musical tradition of this region. It was held in 1985 and became a new tradition promoted from its very beginning. For over 20 years now, the festival has presented valuable music and has gained great national significance. The chief organisers of the festival faced some problems and difficulties from the humble beginnings but nevertheless, they never gave up on their idea. The festival was quickly accepted by audiences. In 1989, a summer festival stage with 1,200 seats was built and all performances from 1985 ‚Äì 89 were broadcast on television and so seen by 30,000 people. Valandovo musical production has issued 35 audio-cassettes, records and video-cassettes. In 1993, the festival was held in Sydney, Australia. The FOLK FEST has been admitted to FIDOV ‚Äì the World Federation of Festival Organisations, with its head office in Los Angeles, United States. This membership enables a worldwide presentation of both Macedonia and the festival. The festival has also received several awards, among others one by Deutsche Welle, a German radio station, for special achievements among our immigrants. Sports The local football club is FK Pobeda and they play in the Macedonian Third League.

The disorder is sometimes referred to as metaphyseal osteopathy, and typically first presents between the ages of 2 and 7 months. HOD is characterized by decreased blood flow to the metaphysis (the part of the bone adjacent to the joint) leading to a failure of ossification (bone formation) and necrosis and inflammation of cancellous bone. The disease is usually bilateral in the limb bones, especially the distal radius, ulna, and tibia. The Weimaraner, Irish Setter, Boxer, German Shepherd, and Great Dane breeds are heavily represented in case reports of HOD in the veterinary literature, but the severity of symptoms and possible etiology may be different across the breeds. For example, familial clustering of the disease has been documented in the Weimaraner, but not in other breeds. The disease in the Weimaraner and Irish Setter can be particularly severe, with significant mortality observed in untreated dogs. The classical age of onset is typically 8 to 16 weeks of age, with males and females equally affected. Speculated causes of HOD Causes have been speculated to include decreased Vitamin C uptake, increased vitamin (other than C) and mineral uptake, and infection with canine distemper virus(CDV). Decreased Vitamin C uptake has been dismissed as a cause, but excessive calcium supplementation remains a possibility. There is no evidence over-feeding is a significant cause. In Weimaraners, recent vaccination with a modified live vaccine has been a suspected cause, partly because HOD often presents immediately after a vaccination, and partly because of the autoimmune nature of the disorder. The canine distemper vaccination in particular has been a suspected causal factor due to the significant number of overlapping symptoms observed between systemically affected HOD puppies and dogs suffering from distemper, but to- date, no definitive linkage has been demonstrated. The cause of canine HOD largely remains unknown. However, because of the familial clustering, HOD in the Weimaraner is suspected to have a genetic, or partly genetic, origin. Clinical Features Figure 2: Characteristic roaching in 4-month-old Weimaraner puppy with HOD. A primary characteristics of the condition is lameness. This is generally due to the swelling of the metaphysis of the long bones that is observed. Other bones may be affected, particularly the ribs, the metacarpal bones, the mandible, and the scapula. Lameness may present as mild limping or more severely as a reluctance or inability to stand. In some breeds and/or individuals, the stance of an HOD puppy as observed from behind has sometimes been described as ‚Äúcow-hocked.‚Äù Shaking of limbs and a reluctance to put full body weight on the front legs is often observed. Sometimes the puppy will exhibit a characteristic ‚Äúroaching‚Äù or arching of the spine when standing (see Figure 2). Lameness is accompanied by pain upon palpation of affected bones, warmth in the limb as felt by the inside of the clinician's wrist, depression, and loss of appetite. Limb involvement is usually bilateral, typically involves the distal radius and ulna, and may be episodic. There is evidence to suggest that most dogs recover after one episode, but some relapse. Dogs suffering systemic manifestations of the disorder often have poorer prognoses. Systemic manifestations include fever, multiple body organ inflammation, nasal and ocular discharge, Diarrhea, hyperkeratosis of the foot pads, pneumonia, and tooth enamel hypoplasia (many of these symptoms overlap with symptoms of CDV). Because early diagnosis must be based on clinical signs, to the extent possible, other disorders should be ruled out (e.g., nutritional bone disease, and osteochondrosis). Radiographic Features Figure 3: X-Ray image of HOD presentation in 4-month-old Weimaraner puppy. Note \\"moth-eaten\\" appearance of metaphyses. Diagnosis relies on clinical signs and characteristic changes in radiographic images of the metaphyses. Bone changes can be observed on radiograph, and the disorder may progress to actual angular limb deformity. In the early stage of the illness, the metaphyseal area on X-ray may be observed to have an uneven radiolucent zone parallel to the physis with a thin band of increased radiodensity directly bordering the physis. Early stage radiographic changes have sometimes been described as having a \\"moth-eaten\\" appearance (see Figure 3). As the disease progresses, the radiolucent line may disappear and radiodensity may increase in the affected area as the body attempts to repair damage. Relapses can cause new radiolucent lines. This area is often followed by a dark line at the metaphysis, which may progress to new bone growth on the outside of that area. This area represents microfractures in the metaphysis and bone proliferation to bridge the defect in the periosteum. Treatment Treatment options have been controversial. Mild illness is often successfully treated with pain medication (usually NSAIDs) and supportive care. Dogs presenting with severe, systemic symptoms not responding to NSAID treatment require more intensive treatment. The Weimaraner and Irish Setter American Kennel Club (AKC) parent clubs advocate the use of immunosuppressive doses of corticosteroids, supplemented with antibiotics and antacids (to compensate for the decreased thickness of the stomach's mucosal lining as a result of the corticosteroids and to decrease the possibility of forming stomach ulcers).http://www.weimclubamerica.org/breeders_ed/columns/january2009.pdfhttp://www.irishsetterclub.org/PDF/Final2007HODPaper.pdf More severe cases that are not recognized and treated early often require IV fluids, electrolytes, nutritional support, and significant nursing care to achieve successful results. AKC parent clubs have supported research into the genetic causes of HOD, and have reported fairly good success using this protocol, saving many puppies from unnecessary suffering, deformity, and death. NOTE: Supplementation of Vitamin C is contraindicated due to an increase in calcium levels in the blood, possibly worsening the disease.

The album was released in December 2005 and consists of thirteen songs from their Traces of Sadness and Blue Tattoo albums. The album was released in several countries in Central Europe, failing to make the top 100 in Germany and Austria, and peaking at #70 in Switzerland. The album also ended their run of three straight album chart number ones in Estonia, failing to chart there also. Best Of was a controversial album because the group had left Bros Records when it was released by the label. It was released without consulting the girls, who were unaware that the album existed until it was released. Best Of is generally considered a money-making venture on the part of their former manager David Brandes, who has been widely reported as by then having an unpleasant relationship with the group. In interviews during the weeks around the album's release, Vanilla Ninja member Piret J√§rvis asked fans to not buy the album, as it would be supporting the Bros label. With the high-profile nature of the interviews, especially in Estonia, the album's sales and chart positions were probably lower than expected. The album was, as the name suggests, essentially a greatest hits album of the group's releases since from their 2004 international breakthrough. The album contained no new material, with the tracks recorded between late 2003 and early 2005. Included on the album were most of their singles, including \\"Tough Enough\\", \\"When The Indians Cry\\", \\"I Know\\" and their Eurovision Song Contest 2005 song \\"Cool Vibes\\". No tracks from their first album, Vanilla Ninja, were included, almost certainly because this was released by TopTen and not Bros Records. This meant that their first single, \\"Club Kung Fu\\", was missing. The album was generally criticised by critics, mostly because the girls' career was not long enough to warrant a \\"Best Of\\" album. Notably, the album cover for Best Of showed the original Vanilla Ninja line-up, with Maarja Kivi shown instead of Triinu Kivilaan, despite her leaving the group in mid-2004. This was probably because Kivi was signed to Bros as solo artist, with her inclusion on the cover helping to promote her then-upcoming single \\"Could You\\".

See Nazi punk for information on the latter. The Dentists were an English indie rock band from the Medway towns (as part of the Medway scene) in England, who were active from 1984 to 1995. The band's permanent members were Mick Murphy (lead vocals), Bob Collins (guitar) and Mark Matthews (bass). The band also had three different drummers: Ian Smith (1984‚Äì1986), Alun Jones (1986‚Äì1991) and Rob Grigg (1991‚Äì1995). All members participated in writing songs. Mark ('Jock') Reid was Mick Murphy's predecessor as lead singer for the band in 1983 when they were known as The Ancient Gallery. History The band met at school in the early 1980s and began playing gigs in their local area around Chatham and Rochester. Their first single, Strawberries are Growing in My Garden (and It's Wintertime), was quickly followed by the album Some People Are On The Pitch They Think It's All Over It Is Now (a reference to Kenneth Wolstenholme's famous commentary at the end of the 1966 World Cup). The record was produced by Allan Crockford of fellow Medway band The Prisoners and featured the standout track I Had An Excellent Dream. In December 1986, the band supported Del Amitri at the Marquee Club in London, and the Go-Betweens at the Astoria, London. In the same year, a reissue of Strawberries ... received radio play from John Peel and Andy Kershaw and was named 'runner-up Single of the Week' by Smash Hits magazine; it reached the Top 40 indie charts. The following year, the band recorded a radio session for Janice Long. Shortly afterwards, their Writhing On The Shagpile EP also made the indie charts. In 1987, on their third visit to mainland Europe, the band were signed by the Belgian label Antler Records, who released a compilation album, Beer Bottle and Bannister Symphonies, and 12\\" single, \\"The Fun Has Arrived\\". During the late 1980s the Dentists were the main attraction in the Medway Bands' Cooperative (their closest rivals being The Claim). The cooperative was chiefly run by Andy Webber of The Hyacinth Girls and would organise both small gigs and multi-act showcases (including the 'Blabber Club' at Churchill's in Chatham), featuring up-and-coming bands such as The Drunken Popes, The Strookas and Power in Motion. In June 1987, The Dentists headlined a show at the George Hotel in Chatham which featured all 23 acts. After a relatively quiet period with no new releases for over two years, the band's second album, Heads and How to Read Them, was released on Antler in 1991. Third drummer, Rob Grigg replaced Alun Jones on the eve of the European Tour to promote the album. Over the years, the band had attracted an underground following in the United States, and two American fans arranged for the band to play the 1991 College Music Journal festival. Shortly afterward, the Dentists were signed by the American label Homestead Records, which released the compilation Dressed (1992) and the album Powdered Lobster Fiasco (1993). In 1992, the Dentists released three seven-inch singles - \\"See No Evil\\", \\"Hear No Evil\\", and \\"Speak No Evil\\" - simultaneously on three different record labels. Each single consisted of two songs by the band and an eponymous poem by John Hegley, read by the poet. Powdered Lobster Fiasco finally attracted the attention of a major label, and the band signed to Eastwest Records in 1993. Their first album for Eastwest, Behind the Door I Keep the Universe, reached Number 8 on the CMJ College Radio charts and was followed by a six-week tour of the U.S. supporting Shonen Knife. A second album, Deep Six was recorded in early 1995 and produced by Wharton Tiers, but it failed to sell, and the band parted company with Eastwest. A demo of new songs was recorded in France, produced by Mike Hedges but Collins left the band shortly afterwards, their final appearance coming at the 1995 CMJ Music Marathon in New York City. The other members went on to form a new band, Coax with Chris Flack on guitar. Lida Husik covered \\"Strawberries Are Growing in My Garden (and It's Wintertime)\\" on her 1995 album Joyride. Some People Are on the Pitch They Think It's All Over It Is Now was re-released on CD in 2005 by Rev-Ola Records, a subsidiary of Cherry Red. In 2010, a new Dentists compilation of previously unreleased demos and rarities If All The Flies Were One Fly, was released and the band played two reunion gigs, one with fellow Medway band The Claim on Thursday 25 March 2010 at Dingwalls in Camden Town, London, and the following night, supported by The Love Family, at the Beacon Court, Gillingham. Some People Are on the Pitch They Think It's All Over It Is Now was reissued on vinyl LP in the United Kingdom and United States by Trouble in Mind Records in 2013.

They are graphic novelists who created 'Louis' and The Red Shoes and Other Tales. Photographed at their home. Metaphrog are graphic novelists Sandra Marrs and John Chalmers, best known for making the Louis series of comics. History Marrs is originally from France, where she studied Arts and Letters. Chalmers is from the west of Scotland and has a scientific background with a PhD in Electronic and Electrical Engineering in Micromachining. Together they live in Glasgow. In general, Marrs draws the comics while Chalmers writes the scripts. They started their first comic together, Strange Weather Lately, in 1995. The Sunday Herald in Glasgow described Strange Weather Lately as \\"the existential adventures of Martin Nitram, an unpaid theatre worker engaged in an attempt to mount a cursed play, The Crimes Of Tarquin J Swaffe.\\" (Beadie, Brian (23 May 1999). \\"Comically graphic tales from the Glasgow underground\\". The Sunday Herald, p. 7.) The Strange Weather Lately comics ran for 10 issues until 1999, and were then collected into two graphic novels. They then moved on to the Louis (graphic novel) series, which includes Louis - Red Letter Day, Louis - Lying To Clive, Louis - The Clown's Last Words, Louis - Dreams Never Die and Louis - Night Salad. In 2011, they redrew and repainted Louis - Red Letter Day and this new version was published in hardback. Louis - Red Letter Day and Louis - Lying to Clive were also each published as a webcomic on serializer. Metaphrog were part of a collection of 80 artists from three continents to express their \\"visions and thoughts on the oft forgotten aspects War\\" for the book Warburger published by Stripburger in 2003. Metaphrog teamed up with the UK based record label Fat Cat Records in 2004 to create Louis - Dreams Never Die. For this, musicians hey (from Berlin) and m√∫m (from Iceland) reworked a music track inspired by the Louis books, and Metaphrog made a short animation. The result was a multimedia project with a graphic novel and cd/blue vinyl 7\\". They have been commissioned to work on several projects, including an adaptation of the poem The First Men on Mercury by Edwin Morgan (poet) in comic form. On National Poetry Day 2009, 35000 copies of the pamphlet published by the Association for Scottish Literary Studieswere distributed to all Glasgow Secondary Schools. Other commissioned works include: Skint! for the Scottish Book Trust in 2010 and, in revised form, in 2014; The Photographs for Glasgow Life and Time to Shine: graphic novel for Creative Scotland in 2013. Their work has been exhibited at The British Library, The London Print Studio, The Lakes International Comic Art Festival, The National Library of Scotland, Scotland House in Brussels and Dundee University. The duo travel extensively across the country to promote the medium of comics, visiting schools, libraries, museums, festivals, sharing their experience of making comics. They have given talks at Gordonstoun school, Glasgow School of Art, and visited international school in Europe. In 2015 Papercutz published The Red Shoes and Other Tales a collection of graphic fairy tales adapted from Hans Christian Andersen along with The Glass Case an original short story. This collection was followed by an adaptation of The Little Mermaid in 2017. Metaphrog are Patrons of Reading 2013-2017 at Northfield Academy in Aberdeen and were Writers in Residence at the Edinburgh International Book Festival 2015. They are the winners of The Sunday Herald Scottish Culture Awards Best Visual Artist 2016.

It was released on 6 July 1999 via Hall of Sermon label . Background Elodia is a concept album and a rock opera, divided into three acts. The first act describes a love that is slowly being overwhelmed; the second act describes the act of separation itself, while the third act begins with a requiem, \\"Sanctus\\", before ending on a note of hope. Elodia was an important point in the development of Lacrimosa's music into more classical areas, with the London Symphony Orchestra, the Rosenberg Ensemble and the Hamburg State Opera contributing to the orchestral side. \\"Sanctus\\" is a particular example of this, as it is based on the Christian liturgy of the same name, and dominated by the choral vocals of the Rosenberg Ensemble. It is not entirely an orchestral work, as it includes a section of Tilo Wolff's vocals and a guitar solo; it did, however, pave the way for the track \\"Kyrie\\" on Lacrimosa's eighth album Echos, which was entirely a classical work. The song \\"The Turning Point\\" starts with Anne Nurmi saying a small poem in Finnish. The poem is \\"Poutaiset pilvet haihtuvat. Katoan nopeasti tuulten mukana, kuin t√§m√§ uni, jossa en en√§√§ sinua tavoita\\", and roughly translates to \\"The white clouds are fading. I disappear quickly with the winds, as this dream, in which I no longer reach you\\". Reception The German Terrorverlag magazine wrote a positive review that lauded the sentimental lyrics and Anne Nurmi's expressive vocals. Especially \\"Turning Point\\" is seen as a review of Nurmi's inner self. The author concluded that the album was definitely a great step in the band's evolution and awarded the album ten out of ten points. Elodia stayed in the German album charts for ten weeks, peaking at position 12. Track listing ¬© & ‚Ñó 1999 Hall Of Sermon GmbH.

Except for his years of exile in Mexico, his life was lived in and around Buenos Aires. Costantini was born and died in Buenos Aires, the only child of Italian Jewish immigrants who lived in the barrio of Villa Pueyrredon. From his marriage to Nela Nur Fernandez, he had three children: Violeta, Ana and Daniel. After he finished his university studies, he became a medical veterinarian. He practiced his profession in the fields near the city of Lober√≠a, in the province of Buenos Aires, where he moved with his wife. There his two daughters were born. In 1955 he returned to Buenos Aires, and his son was born shortly thereafter. He worked in various jobs: veterinarian, salesman, potter, medical researcher, etc. Because of a fierce discipline, working \\"nailed to the chair\\", he was able to write and rewrite everyday. Humberto Costantini working \\"nailed to the chair\\" His first book of stories, De por aqu√≠ nom√°s, was published in 1958, and from that time on there developed a long bibliography which touched all literary genres: short story, poetry, theatre, novel. His unfinished work, Rapsod√≠a de Raquel Liberman, relates in biblical tones the exploits of a Jewish prostitute enslaved by the sinister organization Zwi Migdal, until she rebels against this fate and leaves that life behind her. And here a fundamental theme appears, as in many other of Costantini's works, a force that drives his life and work: \\"To do what is right in the eyes of Jehova, meaning to fulfill one's destiny,\\" as he would say. That attitude-of doing what is right-led him in many moments of his life to confront the powerful, as his heroine, Raquel Liberman succeeded in doing. Costantini was the victim of political persecutions and blacklists. That posture of confronting the powerful that \\"Cacho\\" exercised naturally, without fuss, as the only possible road by which to travel through life, created both hatred and profound loyalty among many toward him. With Costantini nothing was ever wishy-washy; one was either honest or one was deceitful. He made it known that he wouldn't forgive any kowtowing. From his youth he was politically active: in his student days he confronted the Fascists of the Alianza Libertadora Nacionalista and was politically active in the Communist Party until serious divergencies of opinion with the bureaucratic and pro-Soviet leadership caused him to break away. His \\"doing what is right in the eyes...\\" moved him to admire profoundly Ernesto Che Guevara. In the 1970s he was politically active on the revolutionary left, together with other writers, such as Harold Conti and Roberto Santoro, who were imprisoned by the criminal dictatorship of Videla, and to this day are still disappeared. His novel De Dioses, hombrecitos y polic√≠as was written between scary moments and escapes, in clandestine houses at unthinkable hours. This novel was awarded the Casa de Las Am√©ricas Prize by an international jury and published in Mexico (later it was translated as The Gods, The Little Guys and the Police, translated by Toby Talbot and published in New York to excellent reviews). About this novel and other work of Costantini, Julio Cort√°zar said, \\"I love what Humberto Costantini does, and am full of confidence in his work. He is, for me, a very important writer.\\" In 1976 Humberto Costantini was forced into exile and went to Mexico. There he continued his writing that was to win important prizes. He suffered in an exile that obliged him \\"to glance through the lists for his loved ones, as if the city had been hit with a typhoon\\". He conducted narrative workshops regularly, made programs for radio and for television and he fell in love. As he said on his return: \\"In short, I lived\\". Another of his passions was the tango. An admirer of Osvaldo Pugliese, Anibal Troilo (\\"Pichuco\\") and Eduardo Arolas, he was a singer and dancer, knowledgeable in the lyrics and the history of the tango. In get-togethers with friends, there was always some guitar to accompany his voice, resonant with passion, as he would sing the milonga Marieta or El adios de Gabino Ezeiza. He composed milongas and tango lyrics, some of which were published and recorded. In 1983, after seven years, seven months and seven days of exile, he returned to Buenos Aires. There he lived the democratic springtime. He walked through the city, conversed with the streets of his barrio and with old friends of his infancy, knocked around, flabbergasted through his Buenos Aires. His work is published in many languages in addition to English, among them: Czech, English, Finnish, German, Hebrew, Polish, Russian and Swedish. His second novel, appeared in English as The Long Night of Francisco Sanctis, translated by Norman Thomas di Giovanni. He died on the morning of 7 June 1987 from an illness that he had contracted much earlier. The night before, taking advantage of the slight well-being between chemotherapy treatments, he worked‚Äîas he had each day‚Äîon his novel La Rhapsod√≠a de Raquel Liberman of which he managed to complete two volumes. This work remains unpublished.

Puggsy is the name of the title character, an orange space hopper-like alien who landed his spaceship on The Planet, intending to return home until his spaceship was stolen by the raccoon natives of the planet. Gameplay The gameplay is mostly a cross between a normal platform game, with the usual style of platformer enemies and a variety of means to kill them, and a puzzle game of sorts where Puggsy is often required to find objects, and either carry them to a specific location or somehow use them in order to complete levels. There are also a variety of objects that have power- up effects, such as allowing Puggsy to be hit once or twice without dying, speeding him up or making him temporarily invincible, and objects that while not necessary, can be temporarily helpful, such as a variety of guns (most of which have limited ammunition which can often not be refilled). Objects react on a clever physics based system, which was an innovative feature at the time. The system allows objects to be thrown, or to topple if stacked without care. Each object also has a different weight. Another effect of this is that Puggsy can carry stacks of objects along a flat surface, but a slope will often cause all items except the bottom one (held by Puggsy) to topple and scatter. Also, any objects carried out of the level exits give different score values, or in the case of the heart object, an extra life. Other objects are extremely varied, including shells, weights, matches, keys, balloons, cups, barrels, clue-giving chests, knives, and candles. Wabbits World level, a reference to Wiz 'n' Liz The game features 57 levels in a variety of settings (16 of those levels being secret) and 6 boss characters (9 boss characters in the Mega-CD version), although not all levels and bosses have to be finished to complete the game, and 5 training levels, accessed from the \\"Junior\\" option on the title screen. Also, while you can just play through the game normally and reach the normal ending, a few secret \\"endings\\" (cinematic sequences that can only be terminated by resetting the console, or that reset the game themselves) are available by achieving certain goals, such as leaving one secret level with blocks that spelt out the word \\"HEROS\\", playing all 51 normal levels (6 of the secret levels are only accessible via a special password, and are not counted towards the normal level total), or playing through the 6 previously mentioned special secret levels. The password to obtain these levels had to be obtained by evaluating three math expressions that appeared during the credits, where they are called \\"a silly maths equation\\". In the \\"HEROS\\" ending, the player is congratulated for finding the ending, and then asked, \\"...but are you good at maths?\\".  Development  The Puggsy character originally appeared in an Amiga demo named Puggs in Space, which was created and designed by Dionysus‚Äîa demogroup formed by Lee Carus, Alan McCarthy and Tim Wright. The management of Psygnosis was impressed by the demo, and asked Dionysus to develop a game based around Puggsy. However, the contract with Psygnosis to produce a game was short lived; Wright said the company \\"didn't really 'get' where we were going with the game\\". The demogroup was pulled out of the game's development, which was then shifted to Traveller's Tales. Psygnosis asked Traveller's Tales if they could develop a game using the character from the demo. Puggsy was designed and programmed by Jon Burton, while Andy Ingram handled the graphic design and artwork for the game. While the character design for Puggsy was retained from the demo, the developers changed his colour from red to orange to prevent the consoles from colour bleeding. Wright recalled that Dionysus's version was going to be similar to LittleBigPlanet, while the Traveler's Tales' version was created as a standard platformer. The object physics in Puggsy was inspired by Super Mario World, a game Burton had enjoyed. Burton decided to create a Super Mario World-type game, but with puzzles being based on physical objects with different properties such as buoyancy, weight, friction and so on. As Puggsy was deemed too complicated for novice players, the training levels were added late in development in response to the publisher's input. Burton noted that the training levels would give the impression of a basic platformer. The music was written by Matt Furniss, an employee of Krisalis Software. Wright created cover versions of Furniss' tunes for the Amiga version and added a Puggsy demo theme into a tail end of one of the pieces. Wright found Furniss' music \\"really well written and fun to convert to the Amiga, so there were no bad bones.\\" A promised sequel, titled as Puggsy II, was teased at the game's ending, but it never materialised. The SNES version was almost completed, but it was cancelled, with developers hoping to find the SNES version and release it in public domain. As the Mega Drive cartridge copiers were defaulted to simulate a battery-backed SRAM for storing save data, Puggsy uses an SRAM as a means of an anti-piracy feature. Since the game employs a password system, genuine cartridges do not contain an internal SRAM. The game performs an SRAM check after its fifth level, and if an SRAM is found, it displays a warning message telling the player to stop playing a \\"silly\\" version of Puggsy. Reception MegaTech gave the game 90% and a Hyper Game Award, saying that it was \\"excellently designed and thought-out\\", but listed the control system as the major weak point.MegaTech rating, EMAP, issue 21 Reviewing the Mega-CD version, GamePro praised the controls, the graphics, the sound effects, the strong challenge, and the attention to detail, concluding that \\"Though veteran gamers will quickly tire of Puggsy, younger players will enjoy his island antics.\\"  References  External links *A webpage that has original \\"Puggs in Space\\" demo in avi-format *Webpage for Tim Wright, the musician & sound effects creator for the original AMIGA Demo Category:1993 video games Category:Amiga games Category:Platform games Category:Psygnosis games Category:Sega Genesis games Category:Sega CD games Category:Traveller's Tales games Category:Video games scored by Tim Wright Category:Video games developed in the United Kingdom Category:Cancelled Super Nintendo Entertainment System games ","title":"Puggsy"},{"id":"3887245","text":"Rinaldo may refer to: *Renaud de Montauban (also spelled Renaut, Renault, Italian: Rinaldo di Montalbano, Dutch: Reinout van Montalbaen), a fictional knight in the medieval Matter of France *Rinaldo (Jerusalem Liberated), a character in a 1580 epic poem by Tasso **Rinaldo (opera), a 1711 Italian opera by George Frideric Handel, based on the above character **Rinaldo (cantata), an 1863 cantata by Johannes Brahms, based on the above character *HMS Rinaldo, one of four ships of the name launched between 1808 and 1943 by the Royal Navy  Books and films  *Rinaldo Rinaldini, the Robber Captain, a 1797 novel by Christian August Vulpius ** Rinaldo Rinaldini (film), a 1927 film based on the book ** Rinaldo Rinaldini (TV series), a 1968 German television series later released in France as La kermesse des brigands People with the name *Rinaldo Conti (1199 or c. 1185‚Äì1261), who later became Pope Alexander IV *Giovanni Rinaldo (1720‚Äì1795), Count of Carli-Rubbi, Italian economist and antiquarian *Rinaldo de Lamare (1910‚Äì2002), Brazilian physician who specialized in pediatrics *Matthew John Rinaldo (1931‚Äì2008), United States Representative from New Jersey *Theodore Rinaldo (1944-2000), an American businessman, charismatic religious leader, and convicted child sex offender *Sandie Rinaldo (born 1950), Canadian television journalist and news anchor *Ant√¥nio Rinaldo Gon√ßalves (born 1966), Brazilian footballer *Zac Rinaldo (born 1990), Canadian professional ice hockey player See also *Monte Rinaldo, municipality in the province of Fermo, Italy * *Rinaldi it:Rinaldo ","title":"Rinaldo"},{"id":"3887262","text":"Eric Leslie Gandar Dower (1894 ‚Äì 4 October 1987) was a Scottish Unionist Party politician and businessman. He was educated at Brighton College, like his elder brother Leonard, and at Jesus College, Cambridge, and trained for the stage at the Royal Academy of Dramatic Art, touring with a number of theatre companies. Gandar Dower established Aberdeen Airport and Aberdeen Airways serving routes between Aberdeen and Edinburgh, Glasgow, Wick, Thurso, Kirkwall, and Stromness. The airline changed its name to Allied Airways (Gandar Dower) Ltd. when it started the first British/Norwegian airline route, between Newcastle and Stavanger in 1937. He served as a Flight Lieutenant in the Royal Air Force Volunteer Reserve from 1940 to 1943. Following the War, he was elected as Conservative Member of Parliament for Caithness and Sutherland at the 1945 general election with a majority of just 6 in the tightest ever three-way marginal: just 61 votes separated him from the third-placed candidate, Liberal Party parliamentary leader Archibald Sinclair. Sinclair had acted as Secretary of State for Air during World War II and could not spend much time in his constituency, Britain's northernmost mainland seat. Gandar Dower had based his 1945 election platform on serving as a wartime MP until the end of the conflict with Japan. His election address stated, \\"If I am returned I shall resign when Japan is beaten and stand again at the by- election which will follow, so that you can decide whether you wish me to continue as your representative in peace\\" and followed this up with an eve-of- poll \\"special message\\" stating, \\"Note - Gandar Dower, if elected, has pledged himself to resign at the end of the Japanese war and to stand again at the resultant by-election.\\"'' In his victory speech at the declaration, he said, \\"Don't regard me as a Unionist. I am a member of the National Party until the end of the Japanese war, when you will then have a chance again to put me in or out.\\"The Times, Tuesday, 19 Nov 1946; pg. 5; Issue 50612; col D After the war ended on 14 August 1945, Gandar Dower did not resign, but pledged to do so \\"later\\".The Times, Monday, 25 Feb 1946; pg. 2; Issue 50385; col C On 14 February 1946, Gandar Dower announced that he would shortly be resigning his seat but later withdrew the resignation.The Times, Friday, 15 Feb 1946; pg. 2; Issue 50377; col C On 28 December 1946, Gandar Dower offered to resign in the New Year, citing the marriage of his Private Secretary as a reason, but he withdrew this resignation on 11 February, citing the \\"rumours and cross- rumours\\" in the press which had been caused by his announcement, and how they \\"have been damaging to the Unionist cause.\\"The Times, Saturday, 28 Dec 1946; pg. 4; Issue 50644; col F ; The Times, Wednesday, 12 Feb 1947; pg. 4; Issue 50683; col E ; The Times, Monday, 17 Feb 1947; pg. 5; Issue 50687; col F On 30 June 1947, The Times reported, \\"With the forthcoming fusion of the Caithness and Sutherland Conservative Associations it is certain that there will be no by-election in this constituency. Backed by the unanimous support of both associations, Mr. E.L. Gandar Dower, the Conservative MP for Caithness and Sutherland, will hold his seat probably until the next General Election.\\"The Times, Monday, 30 Jun 1947; pg. 4; Issue 50800; col D At a 15 September 1948 meeting of his local Conservative Association, he attempted to bring matters to a head by calling on the association to renominate him as the Conservative candidate for a by-election that he now intended to trigger. He was overwhelmingly defeated, with only 8 members voting for him to follow through with this course of action and numerous members expressing their dissatisfaction.The Times, Thursday, 16 Sep 1948; pg. 3; Issue 51178; col C In response to this, he declared that he would be standing at the next general election as an Independent, and from 3 October 1948, he withdrew from the Conservative whip.The Times, Monday, 4 Oct 1948; pg. 5; Issue 51193; col A On 12 December 1948, the Caithness and Sutherland Conservatives selected David Robertson to replace Gandar Dower. In the event, Gandar Dower decided not to seek re-election at all, and he retired at the 1950 general election. Gandar Dower's brother, Alan, also served as a Conservative member of parliament, while another, Kenneth, was a leading explorer and navigator.Malies, J.

Smith) in October 1992; that Thanksgiving, he and wife Sarah Gordon (Jensen Buchanan) are involved in a hit and run accident and Sarah is killed. Over the next several months Nora and Bo work side by side trying to track down the killer. The case is finally closed and the two become best friends; their relationship slowly grows into romance after a kiss on New Year's Eve. The couple's first date is at Serenity Springs and is soon followed by a slew of junk food eating and jitterbug dates. Bo and Nora first have sex in April 1993 and express their love in May 1993. However, Nora's chronic headaches worsen, leading her to believe that she is the one who caused the accident leading to Sarah's death. Bo soon proves this to be false and proposes marriage. Nora is diagnosed with a brain tumor but recovers. Bo and Nora marry on June 1, 1995, at St. James Church. The ceremony is officiated by Reverend Andrew Carpenter (Wortham Krimmer), Rabbi Heller, and rock and roll singer Little Richard. Bo is devastated when his son Drew Buchanan, a police officer, is killed in the line of duty on September 16, 1998.http://www.soapcentral.com/oltl/recaps/1998/980914.php Nora hopes to conceive a child to give her husband a reason to live; out of desperation she turns to former lover Sam Rappaport (Kale Browne). The pregnancy pulls Bo back onto his feet, but he and Nora later divorce in 1999 when it is revealed that Nora's son Matthew had apparently been fathered by Sam. It is not until Sam's death in 2003 that the truth comes out about how Matthew (Eddie Alderson) is Bo's son, Sam had been aware of it, and that he kept the secret. In July 2008, Bo and young Rex Balsom (John-Paul Lavoisier) travel back in time to 1968; Bo finds himself reliving his past as his own father Asa Buchanan, while Rex is Bo. They both ultimately return as history writes itself with one exception: Rex (as Bo) sleeps with Asa's ex-mistress Emma Bradley. This proves significant in February 2009 when a paternity test determines that David Vickers (Tuc Watkins) -- whom a previous DNA test had supposedly established is Asa's son by Emma -- is actually's Bo's son. In 2009, Nora and Clint (Jerry verDorn, onward) begin a relationship. Bo and Nora spend more time together when Matthew is in an accident and becomes paralyzed; soon Clint senses that Bo and Nora still harbor feelings for each other. Nora accepts Clint's proposal, but she kisses Bo the night before her wedding to Clint. Nora loves Clint and goes through with the wedding to Clint, but she becomes further wrapped up with Bo when Matthew sues his parents for the right to have a dangerous surgery that may help him walk again. Bo and Nora finally confess their love for each other and have an affair. When Clint finds out, he furiously throws Nora out and demands a divorce, blackmailing her into signing over the Buchanan mansion, which Asa had left to her in his will. In April 2010, Bo is shot by Schuyler Joplin (Scott Clifton) but survives, soon asking Nora to marry him on April 9, 2010. In June 2010, after a decade apart, Bo and Nora remarry in a ceremony officiated by David. On finale episode, first-run January 13, 2012, Bo became a grandfather to Drew Buchanan II, via Matthew. In October 2012, on General Hospital, T√©a Delgado's baby is stolen by Heather Webber. Anna Devane mentions that Bo is still the Police Commissioner in Llanview and John McBain notes that he is doing everything he can to help apprehend Heather. After Heather is apprehended, T√©a learns that her child is actually the child of Sam McCall, and that Todd Manning switched her child with Sam's. Distraught, T√©a returns to Llanview.

Uses and occurrence Used to describe an aspect, the gnomic is considered neutral by not limiting the flow of time to any particular conception (for example, the conceptions of time as continuous, habitual, perfective, etc.). Used to describe a mood, the gnomic is considered neutral by not limiting the expression of words to the speaker's attitude toward them (e.g. as indicative, subjunctive, potential, etc.). Used to describe a tense, the gnomic is considered neutral by not limiting action, in particular, to the past, present, or future. Examples of the gnomic include such generic statements as: \\"birds fly\\"; \\"sugar is sweet\\"; and \\"a mother can always tell\\".Payne & Payne (2006), Exploring language structureTrask (1993) A dictionary of grammatical terms in linguistics. If, as an aspect, it does take temporality into consideration, it may be called the empiric perfect aspect. Generally, though, it is one example of imperfective aspect, which does not view an event as a single entity viewed only as a whole, but instead specifies something about its internal temporal structure. A grammatical gnomic aspect occurs in literary Swahili, where the -a- form of the verb is gnomic (sometimes called \\"indefinite tense\\") and the -na- form of the verb is episodic (sometimes called 'definite tense' or just 'present'). Spanish, Portuguese and Catalan do not have a gnomic inflection in their verbs like Swahili, but they do have lexical aspect in their be verbs ser (in Catalan, ser or √©sser) (gnomic) and estar (episodic). For instance, estar enfermo (Spanish) estar doente (Portuguese) or estar malalt (Catalan) means to be sick (episodic), whereas ser enfermo (Spanish), ser doente (Portuguese) or √©sser malalt (Catalan) means to be sickly (gnomic). However, most languages use other forms of the verb to express general truths. For instance, English and French use the standard present tense, as in the examples given above. In Classical Greek, Tongan, and Dakota, the future tense is used. Biblical Hebrew uses the perfective aspect. In Japanese, an imperfective clause with the wa (topic) particle is used for generic statements such as taiyou-wa higashi-kara nobo-ru [sun-TOP east-from rise-IPFV] \\"the sun rises in the east\\", whereas the ga (subject) particle would force an episodic reading.Nariyama, Shigeko (2003), Ellipsis and reference tracking in Japanese, pp 366‚Äì367 English English has no means of morphologically distinguishing a gnomic aspect; however, a generic reference is generally understood to convey an equivalent meaning. Use of the definite article \\"the\\" or a demonstrative determiner usually implies specific individuals, as in \\"the car he owns is fast\\", \\"the cars he owns are fast\\", or \\"those rabbits are fast\\", whereas omitting the definite article or other determiner in the plural creates a generic reference: \\"rabbits are fast\\" describes rabbits in general. However, the definite article may also be used in the singular for classes of nouns, as in \\"The giraffe is the tallest land mammal living today\\", which does not refer to any specific giraffe, but to giraffes in general. English generally uses the simple present tense as the equivalent of a gnomic aspect, as in \\"rabbits are fast\\" and \\"water boils at 212 ¬∞F\\". The simple present is used with specific references for the equivalent of a habitual aspect, as in \\"I run every day\\"; likewise, the auxiliary \\"will\\" is used with specific references for the habitual aspect, as in \\"he will make that mistake all the time, won't he?\\". Thus, in English the gnomic aspect takes the same form as the habitual aspect. The English \\"reportive present\\" tense as seen in newspaper headlines like \\"Technical Innovations Increase Efficiency, Lower Costs\\" can be viewed as gnomic. Ancient Greek In Ancient Greek, a general truth may be expressed in the present imperfective, future, or aorist, which are called in these cases the gnomic present,Smyth, Herbert Weir, Greek Grammar, paragraph 1877: :Present of General Truth. ‚Äì The present is used to express an action that is true for all time: ·ºÑŒ≥ŒµŒπ Œ¥·Ω≤ œÄœÅ·Ω∏œÇ œÜ·ø∂œÇ œÑ·Ω¥ŒΩ ·ºÄŒªŒÆŒ∏ŒµŒπŒ±ŒΩ œáœÅœåŒΩŒøœÇ time brings the truth to light Men. Sent. 1. ::a. The present is an absolute tense in such sentences. The future, aorist, and perfect may also express a general truth. the gnomic future,Smyth, paragraph 1914: :Gnomic Future. ‚Äì The future may express a general truth: ·ºÄŒΩ·Ω¥œÅ ·ºêœÄŒπŒµŒπŒ∫·Ω¥œÇ œÖ·º±·Ω∏ŒΩ ·ºÄœÄŒøŒªŒ≠œÉ·æ±œÇ ·ø•·æ∑œÉœÑŒ± Œø·º¥œÉŒµŒπ œÑ·ø∂ŒΩ ·ºÑŒªŒªœâŒΩ a reasonable man, if he loses a son, will (is expected to) bear it more easily than other men P. R. 603 e. and the gnomic aorist.Smyth, paragraph 1931: :Gnomic Aorist (Œ≥ŒΩœéŒºŒ∑ maxim, proverb). ‚Äì The aorist may express a general truth. The aorist simply states a past occurrence and leaves the reader to draw the inference from a concrete case that what has occurred once is typical of what often occurs: œÄŒ±Œ∏·ΩºŒΩ Œ¥Œ≠ œÑŒµ ŒΩŒÆœÄŒπŒøœÇ ·ºîŒ≥ŒΩœâ a fool learns by experience Hesiod, Works and Days, 218, Œ∫Œ¨ŒªŒªŒøœÇ Œº·Ω≤ŒΩ Œ≥·Ω∞œÅ ·º¢ œáœÅœåŒΩŒøœÇ ·ºÄŒΩŒÆŒªœâœÉŒµŒΩ ·º¢ ŒΩœåœÉŒøœÇ ·ºêŒºŒ¨œÅ·æ±ŒΩŒµ for beauty is either wasted by time or withered by disease I. 1. 6. There is also a gnomic perfect.Smyth, paragraph 1948: :Empiric Perfect. ‚Äì The perfect may set forth a general truth expressly based on a fact of experience: ·º° ·ºÄœÑŒ±ŒæŒØ·æ± œÄŒøŒªŒªŒø·Ω∫œÇ ·º§Œ¥Œ∑ ·ºÄœÄŒøŒªœéŒªŒµŒ∫ŒµŒΩ lack of discipline ere now has been the ruin of many X. A. 3. 1. 38. These are not distinct tenses, but simply uses of the tense. A gnomic future, the rarest of the three usages, similarly states that certain events often occur, and does not imply that an event is going to occur. A gnomic aorist (the most common of the three usages) likewise expresses the tendency for certain events to occur under given circumstances and is used to express general maxims. The gnomic aorist is thought to derive (as the English example does) from the summation of a common story (such as the moral of a fable). Perhaps in imitation of Greek conventions, Latin sometimes uses a gnomic perfect. Notes References * Smyth, Herbert Weir, Greek Grammar, 1920.

It was added to the National Register of Historic Places in 1978. History Peery's Egyptian Theater was built after the fiery demise of the Arlington Hotel in 1923. Harman and Louis Peery devised a plan to build a grand theater, \\"The Showplace of the West\\". The architectural firm of Hodgson & McClenahan, notable for many important Wasatch Front landmarks, was hired for the task. They took cues from many of the most famous western theaters, including Grauman's Egyptian Theatre in Hollywood, and settled upon an Egyptian-themed showhouse. Construction began in 1923 on the cleared area left from the Arlington Hotel, and incidentally, the location of the Peerys' first Ogden home. Ten months passed, and on July 3, 1924, the Egyptian opened. The first feature played at the new theater was Zane Grey's Wanderer of the Wasteland. This \\"natural color\\" silent film was accompanied by the Mighty Wurlitzer, the Egyptian's famous pipe organ. The first \\"talking picture\\" was In Old Arizona, shown in 1929. This downgraded the role of the house pipe organ, which was occasionally used during intermissions and other programs. In 1960, the organ was removed and put into storage. Twentieth Century-Fox, the chain to which the Egyptian belonged, incorporated in 1935. Both of the Peery's theaters, the Egyptian and the Ogden, were leased by Fox Inter-Mountain Theaters as a result. A renovation of the theater's entrance increased the marquee size fourfold and added new box office and a new ceiling to the lobby. In 1951, Fox refurbished the Egyptian, adding many new and more splendid details to the theater. 1953 saw the arrival of two new and important events for the theater. The 3-D movie It Came from Outer Space was shown, a first of that type for the house, and then The Robe, a CinemaScope film, debuted. The format of CinemaScope, of more than two-to-one ratio in width versus height, necessitated the removal of two of the inner-proscenium columns. A four-channel high-fidelity system was also installed to accommodate the increasing significance of stereophonic sound in movies. The subsequent remodeling in 1961 was met with mixed reactions. Many of the details of the original theater were painted over or removed. Pink curtains were accompanied by pink auditorium walls. A new, wider and larger screen was installed in front of the proscenium. Seating was also reconfigured, reducing capacity from 1,200 to 850 in an effort to increase the legroom and comfort of patrons. A reconditioning of the seats also occurred, further updating the standards. In the following years, many different iterations of what was known as the Fox Inter-Mountain Corporation would keep the Egyptian at the forefront of the local theater scene. It showed first-run movies well into the early 1980s, when management passed to a smaller local chain. Lacking the presence and funding needed for first-run movies, the theater progressed to a second-run theater shortly before it was closed in 1984, due to a health code violation. Many thought that the glory days of the Egyptian were over, and that there was no future for a classic, single-screen theater in Ogden. The theater was threatened on many occasions with demolition, as it sat, boarded up and unused. Rumors abounded until the theater was finally purchased, in the eleventh hour, for the original 1924 construction price of $250,000. Facilitated by the Weber County Heritage Foundation, the building was handed over to the Egyptian Theater Foundation, which was created as a means to facilitate the refurbishment of the classic showhouse. First Ogden City, then Weber County were given ownership of the building. A complete restoration was accomplished with the partnership of Weber County, Ogden City, Weber State University, the Egyptian Theater Foundation, and the Ogden/Weber Chamber of Commerce. Major donations and contributions from Dr. Louis S. and Jan Peery, the George S. and Delores Dore Eccles Foundation, and the Utah State Legislature were received among hundreds of other smaller gifts. The adjoining David Eccles Conference Center and the Weber County government office, located in a renovated department store, were built and completed during this period. The rescued Egyptian Theater reopened on January 17, 1997. Its role was expanded from a movie house to that of a community theater/performing arts house. A Wurlitzer pipe organ was reinstalled in 2004, completing the historic atmosphere of the theater. In its more recent history the theater has shown classical plays and live musical performances; many Wurlitzer Theatre Pipe Organ performances, classic and documentary films as well as children's films. Annual performances of The Nutcracker Ballet during the Christmas season are very popular. The Sundance Film Festival has screened movies at Peery's Egyptian Theatre since 1998. Significance Peery's Egyptian Theater The 800-seat showhouse used a solid, poured concrete construction. This measure was meant to increase the safety of the occupants, and resist fire, which has been a historically efficient killer of theaters and their patrons. In a test of the building's strength, over 70,000 lbs. of gravel were put onto the top of the auditorium. Such a load barely flexed the strong roof, and is a testament to the construction quality. So proud of the safety of the theater were the owners that they informed the public that the Egyptian was \\"Ogden's Only Fireproof Theater ... A Safe Place for the Kiddies,\\" in large letters on the rear of the building. The Egyptian is one of a few theaters to incorporate an \\"atmospheric\\" ceiling, where a daytime or dusk ambiance can be smoothly changed into one of a star-filled nighttime sky. This effect remains in operation at the present. The terra cotta facade, with its intricate colors and details intact, remains in excellent condition after over 80 years. The seating area comprises one level, steeply raked for a nearly ideal viewing angle without resorting to steps. The seats are split into three parts, with a wide center and two smaller side seating areas to either side. Foot and knee room are comfortable, and the seats are comfortably reclined. The seating area also clings to its roots by using wood-backed seats and no modern-era cupholders. The theater is one of fewer than fifty Egyptian-style theaters that were constructed in the country; only a dozen or so still stand. The \\"atmospheric\\" ceiling is likely one of two that currently exist in use throughout the United States. The Egyptian remains Utah's only bona fide \\"movie palace.\\" See also * National Register of Historic Places listings in Weber County, Utah * Egyptian Theatre (Coos Bay, Oregon) * Grauman's Egyptian Theatre * Mary G.

It is situated on the north-western edge of the Palatinate forest, approx. 10 km west of Kaiserslautern. The earliest traces of human settlement in Landstuhl date from about 500 BCE; the ‚ÄúHeidenfels‚Äù (i.e. \\"heathen rock\\") from the Celtic period was a holy site even until Roman times, and a Roman settlement dates from the 1st Century CE.

In the 15th Century, the noble family of Sickingen assumed responsibility for Landstuhl and the surrounding area. The most famous member of this family was Franz von Sickingen. Franz von Sickingen built his castle in Landstuhl ‚Äì Burg Nanstein (the most visible landmark in Landstuhl and the surrounding area) - into a dominating fortress that was supplemented by Burg Landstuhl. From this base he moved to expand his domains by conquering other parts of southwestern Germany. After several defeats, Sickingen withdrew to his castle and was besieged by Richard Greiffenklau, Archbishop of Trier, and the Counts of the Rhine and Hesse. During the bombardment of Nanstein, Franz von Sickingen was killed. The castle was later expanded by Sickingen‚Äôs descendants, but it was heavily damaged by the French in 1689. Landstuhl is the seat of the Verbandsgemeinde (\\"collective municipality\\") Landstuhl.

Havemeyer was the third generation of his family in the sugar business and oversaw the expansion of the family firm into the American Sugar Refining Company which dominated the sugar industry in the late 19th century. Together with his wife, Louisine Havemeyer, he was an avid and prolific collector of art, one of the earliest collectors to bring Impressionist Art to America, guided by artist Mary Cassatt.Correspondence, 1901-1920, Boxes 1-3, The Havemeyer Family Papers relating to Art Collecting, The Metropolitan Museum of Art. After Louisine Havemeyer's death in 1929, a large part of their collection was bequeathed to the Metropolitan Museum of Art.  Early life  Henry Osborne Havemeyer was born in New York City on October 18, 1847, the eighth of nine children, to Frederick Christian Havemeyer Jr. (1807-1891), and Sarah Louise Henderson Havemeyer (1812-1851). His mother died in 1851 when Harry, as he was known to his family, was three years old. He was raised with the help of his grandmothers, Mary Osborne Henderson and Catharine Billiger Havemeyer, and his oldest sister, Mary Havemeyer. The family lived in a house at 193 West 14th Street, Note: 14th Street was renumbered in 1869. in what was then the northern frontier of New York City. In 1854, Harry Havemeyer, age seven, and his brother Thomas, age nine, were sent to study at the Bellport Academy in Long Island, under the charge of Mr. James Cruikshank. The following year, Harry followed his older brother Theodore to Mr. Betts' School in Stamford, Connecticut. He was a difficult, short-tempered student. After a fight with the principal, he left the school. His formal schooling ended at the age of eight.  Sugar refining  = Havemeyers in the sugar industry (1799‚Äì1842) = In 1799, William Havemeyer (1770-1851) arrived in New York City, followed three years later by his younger brother Frederick Christian Havemeyer (1774-1841). The brothers came from a family of bakers in B√ºckeburg, Germany, and trained in London during the last decades of the 18th century. William Havemeyer was brought to New York under contract to Edmund Seaman to run his sugar bakery on Pine Street. Frederick followed circa 1802, and in 1805 the brothers leased land from Trinity Church on Budd Street (later renamed Vandam Street) to build their own sugar bakery, which opened in 1807. After the Havemeyer brothers retired in 1828, their respective sons, cousins William F. Havemeyer (1804-1874) and Frederick C. Havemeyer Jr. (1807-1891), took over the Havemeyer family business. In 1842 William F. Havemeyer began a political career, serving three terms as Mayor of New York City. In 1856 Frederick C. Havemeyer Jr. moved the business to Williamsburg, Brooklyn leasing a waterfront lot between South 3rd and South 4th Streets on which to establish a steam sugar refinery. In 1861 eldest son George W. Havemeyer, age 22, became partner, but died on November 27, 1861, when his clothes were caught in the crank of one of the refinery's large engines.\\"Sad Death of a Son of ex-Mayor Havemeyer\\" New York Times, November 28, 1861. (Errata: the ex-Mayor, William F. Havemeyer, was not his father. His father was Frederick C. Havemeyer, Jr.) In 1863 Frederick C. Havemeyer Jr. reorganized the business as Havemeyers & Elder, a partnership with son Theodore A. Havemeyer in charge of refinery operations and son-in-law J. Lawrence Elder in charge of the mercantile business. = Havemeyers & Elder (1863‚Äì1882) = When the partnership of Havemeyers & Elder was formed in 1863, Henry Osborne Havemeyer, known in the business as H.O. Havemeyer, was a fifteen-year-old apprentice and, in the family tradition, was learning his way through all aspects of the business from testing sugar at the docks to learning the complex processes of refinery operations, including the carefully guarded secrets of sugar boiling. Subsequently, he became apprentice to J. Lawrence Elder, working on the mercantile aspect of the business‚Äîpurchasing, sales and record keeping. When Elder died suddenly in 1868, H.O. Havemeyer and his brother Thomas took over the mercantile business and became partners in Havemeyers & Elder in 1869. Cousin Charles H. Senff also joined the partnership to manage refinery operations and construction with Theodore A. Havemeyer. By 1868 the Havemeyers & Elder refinery had doubled in size. Known as the Yellow Sugar House,Barta, George L. \\"Old Sugar Days in Brooklyn: Reminiscences\\" The American Sugar Family, Vols. 1-2, 1920, p. 3. it covered the blocks on the East River waterfront from South 2nd Street to South 5th Street. Modern innovations were introduced into refinery operations, such that sugar was refined with great efficiency.Havemeyer, Harry W. Merchants of Williamsburgh. New York: privately printed, 1989, p. 32. By 1876 Thomas Havemeyer was no longer involved in Havemeyers & Elder, and H.O. Havemeyer became the principal partner in charge of the mercantile business. = Refinery fire and rebuilding (1882‚Äì1884) = On Sunday, January 8, 1882, the Havemeyers & Elder refinery was completely destroyed by fire, a loss of $1.5 million.\\"A Great Fire \\" Brooklyn Daily Eagle, January 9, 1882. The partners, Theodore, H. O. and Frederick C. Havemeyer Jr. and cousin Charles H. Senff, agreed to rebuild and constructed a large state-of-the-art refinery, the cost of which required the entire financial resources of the family, including Frederick C. Havemeyer Jr.'s personal fortune. The new refinery was designed by Theodore A. Havemeyer, Charles H. Senff and refinery superintendent Ernest Gerbracht. It was built of completely fireproof materials‚Äîbrick and iron, with cast iron columns and wrought iron beams and girders. Electric lights were installed, a new technology that was less hazardous than gas lights.Landmarks Preservation Commission, Havemeyers & Elder Filter, Pan & Finishing House , September 25, 2007. (Link to pdf.) The refinery reopened for business in January 1884 with a capacity to refine three million pounds of sugar daily. = Formation of the Sugar Trust (1887‚Äì1891) = In 1887 H.O. Havemeyer established the Sugar Refineries Company, known as the Sugar Trust. The late 1870s and 1880s were a time of intense competition in sugar refining, in which the growth of the industry after the Civil War led to overproduction and slim profit margins. Large refineries, such as Havemeyers & Elder, were producing sugar so efficiently and at such great quantity that supply outstripped demand. Refineries were unable to operate at full capacity and many smaller, less efficient refineries failed. In the face of these harsh conditions, the sugar refiners sought to organize in order to control production and pricing. On October 27, 1887, after two years of negotiations, an agreement was reached to combine into a \\"trust,\\" called the Sugar Refineries Company. By year end the Sugar Trust included 17 of the 23 refinery companies operating in the United States. A competition between the company's refineries followed to determine which were most efficient and would remain in operation. By 1890 five refineries remained in operation, with Havemeyers & Elder as the sole New York area refinery. The legality of the Sugar Trust came before the New York State court in a November 1890 suit, People of the State of New York versus the North River Refining Company. This led the Sugar Trust to reorganize as a holding company, the American Sugar Refining Company, which was incorporated in New Jersey on January 10, 1891, by attorneys Elihu Root and John Randolph Dos Passos. Effectively the business practices of the American Sugar Refining Company maintained those of the Sugar Refineries Company and it continued to be known as the Sugar Trust. = Acquisition of refineries (1887‚Äì1895) = In 1887 Havemeyer sought to bring the remaining independent refineries into the Trust. His chief rival on the West Coast was Claus Spreckels, who refused to join the Trust. Using a small California plant that the Sugar Trust had acquired in 1891, Havemeyer began an aggressive price war to put Spreckels out of business. In retaliation Spreckels opened a Philadelphia refinery in 1889, intending to undercut the Trust's business in the East. A fierce price war continued for two years, until the Trust and Spreckels came to an agreement in 1891: Spreckels sold his Philadelphia refinery to the Trust and the two sides agreed to keep out of each other's territory.\\"Sugar Trust War Ended,\\" New York Times, March 31, 1891. Link to pdf. The years 1889-1892 were a severely competitive time for the Trust, where the margin between the cost of raw sugar and the price of refined sugar was at its lowest. Alleviation of conditions came when the McKinley Act of 1890 eliminated import duties on raw sugar. Consequently, prices of refined sugar dropped and there resulted an increase in sugar consumption. In spite of intense competition from Spreckels, the Trust saw profits increase, distributed large dividends, and continued to expand. In 1891 Havemeyer moved to acquire the remaining three Philadelphia refineries. The acquisition of E.C. Knight Company, one of the Philadelphia refineries, was challenged by the U. S. government in the landmark case, United States v. E. C. Knight Co.. In 1895 the Supreme Court ruled in favor of the Sugar Trust, on the grounds that sugar refining was manufacture, not interstate commerce, and was therefore not under the jurisdiction of the federal government, nor covered by the Sherman Antitrust Act. = Arbuckle Sugar and Coffee War 1898-1901 = In 1898 John Arbuckle, a coffee merchant and wholesale grocer from Pittsburgh, head of the Coffee Trust, entered the sugar market. Arbuckle had innovated in the automated packaging of his coffee beans and began to repackage sugar, which he bought from the Sugar Trust, to sell alongside his coffee beans. Arbuckle moved to produce his own sugar and built a refinery in Brooklyn. Thereafter Havemeyer and Arbuckle entered into a fierce competition. Havemeyer bought controlling interest in a coffee business, Woolson Spice Company of Toledo, Ohio, in order to undercut Arbuckle's prices. Arbuckle retaliated by lowering prices on the sugar produced at his new refinery. The price war continued for three years. In 1901 the two men came to an agreement to end their costly war.. = Congressional investigations = On June 12, 1894 H.O. Havemeyer testified before a special committee of senators appointed to investigate the Sugar Trust. He admitted to lobbying on behalf of his interests, which he claimed was within his rights and was common practice. A request was made by a senator to review all the political contributions made by the American Sugar Refining Company in 1892-1893. After seeking counsel, at his next appearance before the committee, Havemeyer declined to submit his company's books for examination or to answer any further questions. In 1897 Havemeyer was brought to trial for contempt of court for refusing to answer the questions put to him by a committee of the United States Senate investigating the amount of donations his company had made to national and state political campaigns in 1892 and 1893. He was found not guilty and the indictment was dismissed. = National Sugar Refining Company of New Jersey (1900) = As a result of the Arbuckle price war, the few independent refineries that were built in the 1890s began to experience financial difficulties. Taking advantage of this, H.O. Havemeyer moved to acquire the remaining independent firms: the Mollenhauers Refinery in Brooklyn, National Sugar Company in Yonkers, New York Refining Company in Long Island City. He did so anonymously, using James H. Post, partner in the independent sugar broker firm B. H. Howell, Son & Company. The three refineries were consolidated into the National Sugar Refining Company of New Jersey, with James H. Post as president and B.H. Howell, Son & Company handling the mercantile side of the business. On May 31, 1900, the National Sugar Refining Company of New Jersey was incorporated in New Jersey. Although independent of the Sugar Trust, the American Sugar Refining Company owned half its stock and the National received preferential treatment from the Sugar Trust. = Expanding west (1902) = After the turn of the century, Havemeyer expanded the Sugar Trust's holdings to the sugar beet industry in the West. In 1902 he consolidated four small Utah factories into the Amalgamated Sugar Company. Also that year, working with The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints (LDS Church), he revitalized the Utah-Idaho Sugar Company. In 1905 he consolidated a group of small sugar factories in Colorado into the Great Western Sugar Company. The Sugar Trust also acquired an interest in the Michigan Sugar Company, the Continental Sugar Company and a half-interest in Spreckels Beet Sugar Company of California. = Expanding south (1906) = In 1892 Havemeyer made his first investment in Cuban raw sugar by investing in the Trinidad Sugar Company along with Charles H. Senff and Edwin Atkins. In 1906 Havemeyer formed the Cuban American Sugar company, centralizing the management of five Cuban raw sugar manufacturers. = Customs fraud 1907 = In November 1907, two weeks before Havemeyer's death, a raid of the docks at the Havemeyer plant in Brooklyn by the U.S. Treasury Department revealed that the scales that were used to weigh incoming raw sugar had been tampered with and the firm had underpaid import duties. Two United States special customs agents, Richard Parr and James O. Brzezinski, tipped off by a disgruntled employee, discovered a concealed spring inserted into the scale which permitted the checker to exert pressure so as to reduce the weight. The criminal case against the American Sugar Refining Company was brought to federal court in New York in 1908 by District Attorney Henry L. Stimson and Felix Frankfurter, and was won by the government in 1909. A civil suit followed to collect custom duties owed to the government. To avoid further litigation and bad publicity, the American Sugar Refining Company agreed to settle the customs fraud case for $2 million in back payment. Individual officers of the American Sugar Refining Company were tried separately for criminal involvement. In 1909 dock foreman Oliver Spitzer was convicted for attempted bribery. Ernest Gerbracht, superintendent, and Charles R. Heike, secretary, and five company checkers were also convicted.  Personal and family life  In March 1870, Havemeyer was married to Mary Louise Elder. Mary Louise, known as Louise, was the sister of his brother-in-law, J. Lawrence Elder. It was a short and unhappy marriage. They were divorced in 1882, with no children. On August 22, 1883, Havemeyer married for the second time to 28-year-old Louisine W. Elder, the daughter of George W. Elder and Matilda Waldron Elder. Together, Henry and Louisine were the parents of three children: * Adaline Havemeyer (1884‚Äì1963), married to banker Peter Hood Ballantine Frelinghuysen I in 1907. * Horace Havemeyer (1886‚Äì1956), married to debutante Doris A. Dick, a daughter of J. Henry Dick. * Electra Havemeyer (1888‚Äì1960), married to polo champion and insurance executive James Watson Webb II, a grandson of William H. Vanderbilt and James Watson Webb, in 1910. Although each of the children collected art in their own right, Electra Havemeyer Webb collected on the grand scale of her parents and went on to found Shelburne Museum to showcase her deep and diverse collections.  Musical interests  H.O. Havemeyer was an amateur violinist. He was a student of noted violinist Frederick Mollenhauer. It was his daily recreation and he would frequently play for three hours a day. H.O. and Louisine Havemeyer held regular Sunday musicales at their home at 1 East 66th Street.Havemeyer, Louisine W. Sixteen to Sixty: Memoirs of a Collector. New York: Ursus Press, 1961, 1993, p. 13-14. Henry Osborne and other members of the family were major collectors of instruments. Some of the most important instruments they collectively owned were two violins: the 1723 Stradivari 'Kiesewette' (played by Maxim Vengerov, Ilya Gringolts, Stefan Jackiw, Philippe Quint and most recently Augustin Hadelich), 1737 Guarneri 'del Ges√π' \\"King Joseph\\", and three cellos: 1711 Stradivari \\"Duport\\" (ex-Rostropovich), 1714 Stradivari \\"Batta\\" (ex-Piatigorsky and most recently on loan to the Metropolitan Museum of Art) and the 1743 Guadagnini \\"Havemeyer\\".  Art collecting and Patronage  Sideboard by Pottier & Stymus owned by Henry Osborne Havemeyer. Circa 1875-1885 H.O. Havemeyer's first art purchases were made during his visit in 1876 to the Centennial Exhibition in Philadelphia with Samuel Colman. He bought carved ivory figures, Japanese lacquered boxes, silk, brocades, and sword guards. Typically his purchases were impulsive, numerous, and deeply personal. Both H.O. and Louisine had distinct tastes for art collecting that largely complemented each other. Both H.O. and Louisine had to be in agreement as to an object's worth for it to enter their now legendary collection. Louisine focused on collecting modern works by European painters, including the then-unappreciated Impressionists. She was most influenced by her close friend Mary Cassatt, who encouraged her to buy works by Edgar Degas and Claude Monet. Louisine would make 33 transatlantic crossings, returning from each major trip with a bounty of great western art. In her will, Louisine identified some 142 works as a bequest to the Metropolitan Museum of Art, and empowered her children to give the museum's curators free rein. By the time they had finished an inventory of the Havemeyer's three-story Fifth Avenue home 1,967 works would be assimilated into the Met's holdings, identified as the H.O. Havemeyer Collection. The Havemeyer collection is represented throughout the galleries, but notably by the sheer volume of works present in the Impressionist collection. Some choice works from the Havemeyer collection are on view at the Shelburne Museum and the University of Michigan Museum of Art.  Homes  = Hilltop, Greenwich, CT = In 1889 H.O. Havemeyer purchased 90 acres on Palmer Hill Road in Greenwich, Connecticut, on which to build a country home. The parcel had been owned by the Palmer and Quintard families for many generations, and was located to the north of Boston Post Road, east of the Mianus River, including 200 virgin acres at Mianus Ridge and Valley. The house was called Hilltop and had a view of Long Island Sound. It was designed by Boston firm Peabody and Stearns, three stories high with numerous facades, high gables, and six large chimneys.. Samuel Colman designed the interiors and furnishings. Walls were covered with Japanese papers. The dining room was modeled after 17th Century Dutch paintings. The library was the principal room adorned with bookshelves, paintings and musical instruments. Superintendent James Troy managed the property, which included barns for horses, cows and pigs. The stables complemented the architecture of the house. There were three long greenhouses and acres of fruit trees and vegetable gardens. Figs were grown, as were orchids and gardenias. A grapery produced Concord grapes, both purple and light green, which won prizes at the Madison Square Garden flower show. The head gardener was George Morrow. = 1 East 66th Street = In 1889 the Havemeyers purchased land at the corner of 66th Street and Fifth Avenue and hired architect Charles Coolidge Haight (1841-1917) to design a building for their residence. Built in the Romanesque Revival style, the residence was four stories high with a round turreted bay at the corner. To design the interiors of the home, the Havemeyers hired the interior design firm of Louis Comfort Tiffany and Samuel Colman. Construction of the building was complete in 1890; the interiors were finished by 1892. A work of art in their own right, the interiors were designed as a harmonious environment in which to display the Havemeyers collections of Asian art, Islamic pottery, Dutch and Impressionist paintings. Tiffany and Colman designed every detail of the interior and its furnishings. They were inspired by the exotic cultures of the Near and Far East. Each room was thematically unique and covered with sumptuous materials, such as embroidered silks and Tiffany-designed glass tiles. Many of the materials used, including in the leaded-glass windows, light fixtures, mosaics and balustrades. were fabricated at the Tiffany Glass and Decorating Co., and the interiors displayed Tiffany's \\"genius as a colorist and a luminist.\\" Islamic-themed mosaics covered the walls of the front hall. Chinese embroidered silk hangings covered the walls of the reception room. Japanese silk brocade panels were assembled by Coleman from the pieces Havemeyer had bought from the Centennial Exhibition in 1876. These fabric panels adorned the ceiling in H.O. Havemeyer's library, which was called the Rembrandt Room as it housed his collection of Dutch paintings. In the music room, where the Sunday musicales were held, walls were hung with Chinese embroideries and lit by a magnificent Tiffany-designed chandelier, inspired by the wildflower Queen Anne's lace and made of clusters of opalescent blown-glass balls. The most spectacular element of the home was the flying staircase, inspired by that of Venice's Doge's Palace. It connected a balcony that circled the upper half of the two-story picture gallery to the room below. Suspended from the ceiling by sparkling chains and fringed with crystal, the stairs floated on a curved piece of cast iron and would tinkle when crossed.Saarinen, Aline B. Proud Possessors. New York: Random House, 1958, p. 157. The house was torn down after Louisine Havemeyer's death in 1929. Some parts of the house are in the collection of the University of Michigan Museum of Art. The carriage house and stables were located at 126 East 66th Street, west of Third Avenue, designed in 1895 by H.O. Havemeyer's cousin William J. Wallace and S.E. Gage and later owned by John Hay Whitney.Willensky, Elliot, and Norval White. AIA Guide to New York City. San Diego: Harcourt, Brace, Jovanovich, 1988, p. 430. = Islip, Long Island = The Havemeyers spent the months of July and August in Islip, Long Island, where H.O. Havemeyer sailed on the Great South Bay. In 1890 they bought property on St. Mark's Lane in Islip, Long Island, next door to Louisine Havemeyer's sister and brother-in-law, Adaline and Samuel T. Peters. In 1900 the Havemeyers moved into the Bayberry Point community that H.O. had developed, occupying the southwesterly house. Havemeyer owned a Herreshoff 30 named Electra which he raced in the Great South Bay. = Merrivale Farm, Commack, Long Island = Havemeyer purchased 500 acres in Commack, Long Island, neighboring the racetrack of Carll S. Burr, who was engaged in breeding and training of trotting horses. Havemeyer was an avid hunter of ducks and other game birds. He owned a large stable of trotting horses and established a pheasant shooting preserve on land nearby.  Philanthropy  Havemeyer was a trustee of the American Museum of Natural History He and his brothers gave Havemeyer Hall for a School of Mines to Columbia University as a memorial for their father Frederick C. Havemeyer Jr. who studied at Columbia College from 1821-1823.. Havemeyer gave a school to the Town of Greenwich, Connecticut.\\"Mr. Havemeyer's Offer to Greenwich\\" New York Times, 9 June 1900. (Link to pdf.)  Death  H.O. Havemeyer died on December 4, 1907, at Merrivale Farm in Commack, Long Island, after a sudden illness.\\"H.O. Havemeyer Dead,\\" The Sun, 5 December 1907. He was at Merrivale Farm with his son Horace for a Thanksgiving visit to shoot pheasant; his wife Louisine remained in New York City to be by her dying mother's bedside. After Thanksgiving lunch, Havemeyer was stricken with acute indigestion. The local doctor was called, but could not help.\\"H.O. Havemeyer Dies at L.I. Home,\\" New York Times, 5 December 1907. (Link to pdf.) His wife and daughter Electra arrived the next morning with three New York City doctors; however, Havemeyer was beyond help. He lived for five days before dying at 3 p.m. on December 4. The cause of death is thought to be peritonitis, as a consequence of undetermined digestive failure, and subsequent kidney failure. Funeral services were held at his home at 1 East 66th Street officiated by Rev. Dr. R. Heber Newton, an Episcopalian minister. Havemeyer was buried at Green-Wood Cemetery.\\"Henry O.

The town is most visited by tourists during the summer and in skiing season. History The first historical references to the village date from 778 AD, though recent archaeological findings suggest that there was already a Carno- celtic settlement here roughly 2,500 years ago. The University of Venice is planning to continue its archaeological studies here over the coming years. Main sights The main summer attraction is some 3,000 species of wild flora that thrive in the commune area. In addition, at one end of the village, the Parco Naturale delle Dolomiti Friulane (a nature reserve) begins. This is the largest European nature reserve which is neither populated, nor crossed by any roads (with the exception of one which is long and mostly used by rangers). Winter attractions are largely snow and ski based, as the village's ski slopes begin at above sea level, on Monte Crusicalas, on the Varm√≤st complex, making this the highest skiing point of the region. There is also a second skiing plane on the southern side of the village, next to its sport complexes (swimming pool, summer tennis courts, and an outdoors ice skating rink). Economy Tourism is the major driving force of the local economy, with many tourists buying second homes in the region. This creates demand for building work and service industry. Less central to the economy, but still noteworthy is the spectacle manufacturing industry. Many employed by this commute to the Veneto region (particularly the Cadore area) where many of the world's major spectacle manufacturers are based.

Ojaharji published his writings in 1966 and his main work was the so-called Vaasa-trilogy - 'Valkoinen kaupunki' (1976), 'Paremmassa maailmassa' (1979) and 'Maa kallis isien' (1982) - which depicts history from the Finnish Civil War to the present day through the eyes of a few sailors.

It is also known as atrophic myositis or eosinophilic myositis. MMM is the most common inflammatory myopathy in dogs. The disease mainly affects large breed dogs. German Shepherd Dogs and Cavalier King Charles Spaniels may be predisposed. There is a similar disease of the eye muscles found in Golden Retrievers. Symptoms of acute MMM include swelling of the jaw muscles, drooling, and pain on opening the mouth. Ophthalmic signs may include third eyelid protrusion, red eyes, and exophthalmos (protruding eyeballs). In chronic MMM there is atrophy of the jaw muscles, and scarring of the masticatory muscles due to fibrosis may result in inability to open the mouth (trismus). The affected muscles include the temporalis, masseter, and pterygoid muscles. The disease is usually bilateral. MMM is caused by the presence of 2M fibers in the muscles of the jaw. 2M fibers are not found elsewhere in the body. The immune system recognizes these proteins as foreign to the body and attacks them, resulting in inflammation. Diagnosis of MMM is through either biopsy of the temporalis or masseter muscles or the 2M antibody assay, in which blood serum of the possible MMM-dog is reacted with temporalis tissue of a normal dog, or both. False negatives by the 2M antibody assay may be obtained if MMM is end-stage with destruction of type 2M fibers and marked fibrosis. Treatment is usually with corticosteroids such as prednisone, often with decreasing doses for up to 4‚Äì6 months, and in the case of trismus, manual opening of the mouth under anesthesia. Feeding very soft or liquid food during this time is usually necessary. The ultimate degree of recovery of jaw function and muscle mass will depend upon the extent of damage to the muscle tissue. Recurrence of MMM may occur. Misdiagnosis of MMM as a retroorbital abscess based on physical examination and finding of trismus leads to inappropriate treatment with antibiotics, which will not impede the progress of MMM.

The District is inhabited by people of different ethnic affiliations, especially the Iraqw people who are some of the earliest agro-pastoralists to migrate to what is now the Republic of Tanzania. Other native tribes are the Wahatzabeti living in Yaeda Chini, living a primitive life, and the Datooga people living in Mbulu Vijijini. People engage mainly in agriculture, keeping livestock and farming activities. There is plantation of onions in Bashay and wheat in many places. The Mbulu District is located in the Mbulu Highlands, with forested mountains like Mount Guwang which are attractive to tourists. There's also a hot spring in Hhaynu. Lake Manyara National Park is partly in Mbulu District where tourists can come and visit. The Sanu Park Inn Lodge in Mbulu town provides accommodations for visitors. Mbulu town has the Nyerere Stadium in Sanu Mbulu, the biggest stadium in whole Manyara Region for football and marathon. One of biggest hospitals in northern Tanzania is found in Mbulu: the Haydom Lutheran Hospital. Administrative subdivisions As of 2012, Mbulu District was administratively divided into 32 wards. =Wards= * Ayamaami * Ayamohe * Bargish * Bashay * Daudi * Dinamu * Dongobesh * Endagikot * Endamilay * Eshkesh * Gehandu * Geterer * Gidihim * Gunyoda * Hayderer * Haydom * Imboru * Kainam * Maghang * Marang * Maretadu * Masieda * Masqaroda * Murray * Nahasey * Nambis * Sanu Baray * Tlawi * Tumati * Uhuru * Yaeda Ampa * Yaeda Chini The district headquarters at Mbulu is said to have started in 1905.

In general, stamp demonetization is a rare event, since any unused stamp is effectively equivalent to its face value, and there is no financial disadvantage if postal customers use old stamps on their mail. Demonetization chiefly occurs in connection with major upheavals in the postal system, such as a transfer from one country to another, or currency changes, such as decimalisation, or a change of government. The process of exchanging millions or billions of stamps in the public's hands, plus that of exchanging post office stock, is usually complicated and difficult, and offers much interest for students of postal history. There are typically two parts to the process; first, the exchange of unused stamps for new ones of equivalent value. This normally occurs at post offices, with patrons bringing in their old stamps. The second part is the handling of mail with stamps already on it. Uncancelled letters, such as those dropped in mailbox, will get a grace period, ending at roughly the same time as the exchange of old stamps. Cancelled letters already in the mailstream may be accepted for a longer period, since remote post offices may not yet have exchanged their stamps, and sometimes there may be delays within the postal system itself.  Eurozone  In the Eurozone, some countries have demonetized stamps denominated in the old currency while others have not. The countries where pre-euro stamps are still valid include Belgium, France, Italy and San Marino. = Austria = Austrian stamps denominated in schillings were demonetized on 1 July 2002. = Finland = Finnish stamps denominated in marks were demonetized at the end of 2011. = Germany = German stamps denominated in Deutsche Marks were demonetized on 1 July 2002. All stamps issued since 9 November 2000 are valid for postage. = Ireland = Irish stamps denominated in pounds were demonetized on 31 December 2002. Stamps issued since 2 August 2000 are valid for postage. = Italy = Italian stamps denominated in Lire are valid, if issued after March 20th, 1967. All Italian stamps issued in Euro and Lire-Euro are valid for postage. = Malta = Malta adopted the euro on 1 January 2008. Stamps issued shortly before and after the changeover (between 22 December 2006 and 28 June 2008) were denominated in both the Maltese lira and euro currencies in accordance with guidelines issued by the National Euro Changeover Committee. Pre-2006 stamps denominated only in lira remained valid for use until 31 January 2008, and they could be exchanged for euro-denominated stamps until March 2008, after which they were demonetized. The dual currency stamps issued since December 2006 remain valid for use today along with euro-denominated stamps. Prior to adopting the euro, Malta had demonetized stamps a number of times, for example all pre-1998 stamps were invalidated in December 2004. = Netherlands = Stamps of the Netherlands denominated in guilders were demonetized on 1 November 2013. It is not possible to exchange guilder stamps for ones denominated in euros. = Portugal = Portuguese stamps denominated in escudos were demonetized in 2002. All stamps issued since 15 March 1999 are valid for postage. = Spain = Spanish stamps denominated in pesetas were demonetized in 2002. All stamps issued since 8 January 2001 are valid for postage. = Vatican City = Stamps of the Vatican City denominated in lire are no longer valid for postage.  Australia  The six self-governing Australian colonies that formed the Commonwealth of Australia on 1 January 1901 operated their own postal service and issued their own stamps. Under section 51(v) of the Commonwealth of Australia Constitution 1900, ‚Äúpostal, telegraphic, telephonic, and other like services‚Äù became a Commonwealth responsibility. The Commonwealth's Postmaster-General's Department became effective on 1 March 1901 (this agency would be disaggregated on 1 July 1975 in part into the Australian Postal Commission trading as Australia Post). All then-current colony stamps which continued on sale became de facto Commonwealth stamps. Some of these stamps continued to be used for some time following the introduction in 1913 of the Commonwealth's uniform postage stamp series. These stamps continued to be valid for postage until 1968.  Hong Kong  In Hong Kong postage stamps have been demonetized only once, which happened because of the 1997 handover. The postage stamps from before 1997 bear the portrait of the King/Queen of the United Kingdom (who at the time of handover was Queen Elizabeth II). Although there was already a series of politically neutral stamps issued (which did not bear the portrait of Queen Elizabeth II nor the words \\"Hong Kong, China\\", which appear on today's Hong Kong stamps) during the period of handover, Hongkong Post decided to let the old stamps bearing the portrait of Queen Elizabeth II be used for a few more years after the handover since there were some old stamps in the hands of Hong Kong people. Hong Kong people can also exchange those old stamps for new ones if they desire. After the transition period, those old stamps bearing the portrait of the King/Queen of the United Kingdom were declared invalid and hence demonetized. The politically neutral stamps were not demonetized however. All stamps issued now bear the word \\"Hong Kong, China\\", as required by Basic Law. As a side note, the Hong Kong dollar coins/notes that bear the portrait of the King/Queen of the United Kingdom were never demonetized, however they will not be recirculated when the banks receive them, primarily because of their old age rather than sovereignty issue.  Poland  The country of Poland has a very recent example of demonetization involving the stamp issues of 1990 to 1994. During this period of time, the face values of stamps due to hyperinflation gradually changed the face values to thousands of z≈Çoty. Commemorative stamp issues from 1995 to 1997 are also demonetized now as are certain selected issues as announced by the Polish Post Office. When a newer stamp issue is demonetized a date is announced; however, if a postal patron in a small town has not been notified of the demonetization or a postal patron does not visit their local Post Office often, then Polish Post Office will accept their obsolete stamps for letter franking well after the demonetization date.  United Kingdom  In the United Kingdom, earlier issues have been demonetized on several occasions. The first when stamps issued during the reigns of Queen Victoria and King Edward VII (issued 1840 to 1911) were declared no longer valid for postage. The second, early in 1970, when the stamps issued during the reigns of King George V, King Edward VIII and King George VI (issued 1911 to 1952) ceased to be valid and the third some months after the introduction in 1971 of decimal currency, when all stamps with pre-decimalization values were demonetized. Queen Elizabeth II ¬£1 value stamps issued prior to 1971 are identifiable by design but remain valid for postage.  United States  United States postage stamps have been demonetized only twice. The first time was in 1851, when the 5-cent and 10-cent stamps of the 1847 issue were declared invalid as of July 1 by the Act of March 3, 1851 reducing the normal letter rate from five to three cents. A few dozen covers are known that carry 1847 stamps after the demonetization date; as stamp usage was then still optional (it would not be made mandatory until 1855), the demonetization seems to have had relatively little impact. The second, more serious, demonetization was prompted by the outbreak of the American Civil War in 1861. Southern post offices held substantial U.S. assets in the form of their stamp stocks, and the Confederates could theoretically have brought in some income by selling those stamps to private individuals in the North. Although in April 1861 John H. Reagan, postmaster of the CSA, ordered the offices in his charge to return their stamps to Washington D.C., few seem to have done so, and by June 1861 U.S. postmaster-general Montgomery Blair ordered the severance of postal ties and the production of new stamps. In August the stamps of the U.S. 1861 issue began to be distributed throughout the Union, along with orders that postmasters should offer to exchange old stamps for new for a period of six days after giving \\"public notice through the newspapers and otherwise\\". After the six-day period was over, that post office was not to recognize the old stamps as paying postage. In addition, postmasters were to accept letters with old stamps from other post offices until set dates, ranging from September 10 in the East, to November 1 from letters arriving from the Far West. (Later the periods were extended for an additional two months.) The process stretched over some months; the large cities in the East were exchanging stamps in the third week of August, while some small remote offices did not start until November. General confusion, combined with exhaustion of the new stamps at some post offices, led to some instances of the old stamps still being accepted on letters after demonetization, although surviving covers are rare. The U.S. stamps of 1861, and all issued since then, continue to be valid on mail.

Produced and distributed by Toho Studios, it is the first film in the Mothra franchise. The film stars Frankie Sakai, Hiroshi Koizumi, Ky≈çko Kagawa, Jerry Ito, and The Peanuts. In 1960, producer Tomoyuki Tanaka hired Shin'ichir≈ç Nakamura to write an original story for a new kaiju film. Co-written with Takehiko Fukunaga, and Yoshie Hotta, The Glowing Fairies and Mothra was serialized in a magazine in January 1961. Screenwriter Shinichi Sekizawa later adapted the story into a screenplay, patterning his version after King Kong (1933) and Godzilla (1954). Mothra was theatrically released in Japan on July 30, 1961. An edited, English dubbed version was released theatrically in the United States on May 10, 1962 by Columbia Pictures. The titular monster, Mothra, would become Toho's second most popular kaiju character after Godzilla, appearing in eleven Godzilla films and her own trilogy in the 1990s. Plot An expedition to an irradiated island brings civilization in contact with a primitive native culture. When one sensationalist entrepreneur tries to exploit the islanders, their ancient deity arises in retaliation. In waters off Infant Island, a presumed uninhabited site for Rolisican atomic tests, the Daini-Gen'you-Maru is caught and run aground in the turbulence of a typhoon. A rescue party following the storm finds four sailors alive and strangely unafflicted with radiation sickness, which they attribute to the juice provided them by island natives. The story is broken by tenacious reporter Zenichiro Fukuda and photographer Michi Hanamura, who infiltrate the hospital examining the survivors. The Rolisican Embassy responds by co-sponsoring a joint Japanese‚ÄìRolisican scientific expediction to Infant Island, led by capitalist Clark Nelson. Also on the expedition are radiation specialist Dr. Harada, linguist/anthropologist Shin'ichi Ch≈´j≈ç, and stowaway reporter Fukuda. Ch≈´j≈ç has studied the cultures of islands in the area and ascertained that one of the key hieroglyphs in their written language, a radiant cross-shaped star, translates as Mothra. There the team discover a vast jungle of mutated flora, a fleeting native tribe, and two young women only twelve inches tall, who save Chujo from being eaten by a vampire plant. The \\"Shobijin\\" (small beauties), as Fukuda dubs them, wish their island to be spared further atomic testing. Acknowledging this message, the team returns and conceals these events from the public. Nelson, however, returns to the island with a crew of henchmen and abducts the girls, gunning down several natives who try to save them. While Nelson profits off a \\"Secret Fairies Show\\" in Tokyo featuring the girls singing, both they and the island natives beseech their god Mothra, a giant egg, for help. Fukuda, Hanamura, and Ch≈´j≈ç communicate with the young women via telepathy; they express conviction that Mothra will come to their aid and warn that \\"good people are sure to be hurt\\". Meanwhile, Fukuda's newspaper has accused Nelson of holding the girls against their will; Nelson denies the charge and files a libel suit against the paper. Meanwhile, the island egg hatches to reveal a gigantic caterpillar, which begins swimming the Pacific Ocean toward Japan. The caterpillar destroys a cruise ship and survives a napalm attack on a beeline path for Tokyo. The Rolisican Embassy, however, defends Nelson's property rights over the girls, ignoring any connection to the monster. Mothra finally arrives on the Japanese mainland, impervious to the barrage of weaponry directed at it, ultimately building a cocoon in the ruins of Tokyo Tower. Public feeling turns against Nelson, and he is ordered to release the girls. He flees incognito to Rolisica, where Mothra, newly hatched in an imago form, immediately resumes her search. Police scour New Kirk City for Nelson as Mothra lays waste to the metropolis. Ultimately, Nelson is killed in a shootout with police, and the girls are assigned to Ch≈´j≈ç's care. Church bells begin to ring, and sunlight illuminates the cross atop the steeple with radiant beams, reminding Ch≈´j≈ç and Hanamura of Mothra's unique symbol and of the girls' voices. Ch≈´j≈ç hits upon a novel way to attract Mothra to an airport runway. The girls are returned amid salutations of \\"say≈çnara\\", and Mothra flies back to Infant Island. Cast Themes Authors Steve Ryfle and Ed Godziszewski note that Honda treats the film's nuclear anxiety and proxy relationship between America and Japan differently. They note that Rolisica (an amalgam of Russia and America) is portrayed as a \\"pushy capitalist superpower\\" that is more concerned with Nelson's money, allowing his crimes in Japan to go unpunished. They also note that Rolisica's atomic ray gun seems to violate Japan's three non-nuclear principles. They iterate that Honda's ideal of understanding and cooperation is achieved through religion, even noting the religious-like iconography of Infant Island. However, they note that the film's political satire \\"never gets too serious.\\" Ryfle notes that some writers compared Rolisica's bombing of Infant Island to America's bombing of Hiroshima and Nagasaki and Nelson's kidnapping of the Shobijin to America's occupation and forced Westernization of Japan. Ryfle expresses that the film paints a bad portrait of Rolisica and by extension, the United States, noting that Rolisica exploits natives for atomic testing and commercial gain (via Nelson), and Nelson's press coverage restriction on the expedition is an attempt of covering up Rolisica's involvement in the bombing of Infant Island. Production During the summer of 1960, producer Tomoyuki Tanaka hired Shin'ichir≈ç Nakamura to write an original story for a kaiju film. Nakamura collaborated with Takehiko Fukunaga and Zenei Hotta (sometimes credited as Yoshie Hotta), with each writer writing one part of the story. The story, The Glowing Fairies and Mothra, was then serialized in Weekly Asahi Extra magazine in January 1961. Tanaka contacted Sho Watanabe about casting The Peanuts in the film. Watanabe gave the twins permission to participate in the film due to being impressed with the \\"uniqueness\\" of the idea. However, Toho had difficulty with scheduling the twins to shoot their scenes due to contractual obligations with Watanabe Productions. For the film, Honda wanted a more Disney-inspired approach, stating, \\"We wanted to do something that was new, for the whole family, like a Disney or Hollywood type of picture.\\" Tanaka created the name \\"Mothra\\" by combining the Japanese word for \\"moth\\" (mosu) and the suffix \\"ra\\", taken from Godzilla's Japanese name \\"Gojira\\". Adding the suffix \\"ra\\" would become a common practice for naming monsters, not just in Toho productions (i.e. King Ghidorah, Ebirah, Hedorah, etc.), but other non-Toho Japanese productions, i.e. Gamera. =Writing= Prior to the original story being written, Toho held story meetings to discuss ideas. One of the ideas included to have Mothra emit a ray beam. While writing the original story The Glowing Fairies and Mothra, Nakamura chose a giant moth because he wanted a creature that underwent a transformation. Producer Tanaka later confirmed that the female perspective for the film was suggested by another producer during the early planning stages. This inspired Tanaka to come up with the idea for the Shobijin and their roles as guardian spirits of a South Seas island. The character Zen'ichir≈ç Fukuda was named after the writers of the original story. In the original story, Fukuda is not on the initial expedition and ventures to Infant Island alone later; the natives reveal to Fukuda the legend of Infant Island; the mythology behind Infant Island include Christian-like overtones which features two Gods (Ajima, the male God of Eternal Night and Ajiko, the Goddess of Daylight) conceiving a giant glowing egg, smaller eggs, and a pair of humans who reproduce and repopulate the island; the smaller eggs hatch caterpillars which turn to moths and fly away, which enrages Ajima to condemn all living things to death and commits suicide by tearing himself apart in four pieces; heart broken, Ajiko also commits suicide by also tearing her body apart in four pieces, which turn into four small immortal fairies dedicated to serving Mothra of the giant glowing egg. Fukuda remains on the island and is later awakened by Nelson's gunfire, witnessing Nelson kidnapping the Shobijin and the natives ritual. Michiko was originally written as Chujo's assistant and the leader of a protest group that unsuccessfully pressures Nelson to release the Shobijin. The original story featured political parallels to a then controversial ratification of a security treaty between Japan and the United States, however, Sekizawa omitted the political backdrop in his version. The original story featured the Rolisican ambassador sending a fleet to protect Nelson and his property from Mothra. While adapting the story for the film, screenwriter Shinichi Sekizawa picked his favorite aspects of the story and ignored everything else. Sekizawa patterned his script after the original King Kong and Godzilla films. Sekizawa felt that too much detail will confuse audiences and that it was more important to keep audiences entertained, stating, \\"My philosophy is to just add enough to tell the story and keep it moving along.\\" Honda later admitted that the fantasy elements were Sekizawa's ideas while Honda was interested in the anti-nuclear themes. Originally, Hotta wanted to include an anti-discrimination message based on a person's size. The original story featured four fairies. Sekizawa felt four was unnecessary and trimmed the members to two, feeling that two fairies was manageable. The original story had the Shobijin stand at 60 centimeters but Sekizawa felt the size was too big and would create difficulties when building the sets. One of the original ideas had one of the Shobijin fall in love with one of the leads, however, Sekizawa dropped this idea because he felt it would have required many twists and turns and would had taken time away from Mothra. Originally, Mothra was to cocoon herself on the National Diet Building but Sekizawa felt it wasn't \\"spectacular enough\\" and changed the setting to Tokyo Tower. It was Sekizawa's decision to refer to the twins as \\"Shobijin\\" (small beauties), feeling that \\"small fairies from Infant Island\\" was too long to write. Sekizawa coined the name \\"Infant Island\\" simply because it \\"sounded good\\". In the United States, several promotional materials referred to the Shobijin as \\"Ailenas\\", despite Japanese publications and materials not using the term. Honda explained that the name originated from the original story that featured a fairy named \\"Ailena\\". The name reached the publicity department for overseas markets. Honda had originally written a scene that showed an area of the island bombed by the atomic bomb but due to budget costs, this scene was not filmed. =Music= The score was composed by Y≈´ji Koseki. Akira Ifukube was originally given the offer to compose the film but declined, feeling he wasn't confident enough to create music for The Peanuts. The lyrics for the Mothra theme were written in Japanese and translated into Indonesian at Tokyo University by an Indonesian exchange student. The track \\"The Girls of Infant Island\\" was released as a single in 1961 while the track \\"Song of Mothra\\" was released as a single in 1978. The track \\"Daughters of Infant Island\\" was co- written by the film's assistant director Koji Kajita. =Special effects= The Peanuts filmed their scenes separately from the main cast. They filmed most of their scenes in front of a blue screen and oversized sets. Their scenes were later composited into the film. The Peanuts never interacted with the cast. Instead, dolls were used for the actors to interact with while a tape recorder with the Peanuts's lines was played back. New Kirk City was designed after Manhattan, Los Angeles, and San Francisco. Honda originally intended to film second unit photography in Los Angeles but due to the budget inflating because of the New Kirk City scenes, Honda had to use library footage of L.A. freeways and beach fronts instead. Honda also intended to show how the inhabitants of Infant Island survived a nuclear blast but budget cost forced him to use a bland cave instead. Honda wanted to create a type of mold for the island and asked the art department to create it but this idea was dropped due to budget costs. The Infant Island natives were portrayed by Japanese actors in dark makeup. The live-action Dam footage was filmed in Kurobe Dam. During a production meeting, effects director Eiji Tsuburaya told the staff he wanted four water tanks to create the raging waters that breaks the dam. Tsuburaya's Chief Assistant Art Director instead built 12 tanks, which held 4,320 gallons of water. The dam was built at a 1/50th scale and four meters high. The miniature mountains around the dam were built with concrete to withstand the pressure of the water, a decision that upset Tsuburaya due to being unable to move the set in order to set up cameras. The dam was also designed to realistically crumble under the weight of the water but due to this, only a small amount of water came out during the first try. Three attempts were made to force the water out and the dam had to be weakened for the effect to succeed. Since Tsuburaya was unable to move the cameras, all three takes were edited together. Several props of various scales were created for the caterpillar and adult Mothra, including one caterpillar prop used specifically for water scenes. A giant suit was produced for the caterpillar Mothra, which allowed larger sets and details to be included. The suit was the largest monster suit that Toho had ever produced. It was built at 1/25th scale, was seven meters long, and required five to six actors inside to move it. Haruo Nakajima and Katsumi Tezuka lead members of the special effects art staff inside the suit. A hand-operated model of the caterpillar was also produced. The hand model had a more narrow, oval shape than the other models and had small legs at the bottom, a feature that other models lacked. The Tokyo Tower model was built by a metal works company. The tower model was built using blue prints by the Toho effects staff who photographed and researched the real tower. However, the blue prints only showed one side of the tower, which forced the metal works company to figure out the angles to build the other sides. The effects staff had initially requested the original blueprints of Tokyo Tower but were unable to obtain them. Toho closely guarded the custom tower model blueprints to keep competing studios from benefitting from Toho's work. Mothra's silk was created from a form of liquid styrofoam called \\"expanded Polystyrene\\". A small model and large model was built for the atomic ray cannon. Three different models were built for the adult Mothra, each with different functions. A mid-sized model with more flexible wings was used for the hatching scene. The mid-size model has a smaller thorax and the wingspan is shorter, compared to the other models. The large model was built in 1/100th scale with a wingspan of 2.5 meters. Due to this, the wing movement was less flexible. The eyes were lit by lightbulbs from inside the head and the eyes were constructed from clear latex. The smaller model was only used for extreme long shots of Mothra advancing on New Kirk City. To make the wings flap, the models were suspended on wires from an overhead motorized brace that would open and close. The wires were attached at the center of the wings rather than the tips, which allowed the wings to feely flap at the edges. =Alternate ending= Toho had deemed Mothra's attack on New Kirk City too expensive and advised Honda and Sekizawa to write a more budget friendly climax. The new ending had Nelson and his crew take Shinji hostage near a volcano, which Nelson falls into after Mothra flaps her wings. Toho's contract with Columbia Pictures stipulated that the climax needed to take place in an American-style city. Toho sent a letter to Columbia Pictures requesting approval to change the climax but rather than wait for a reply, Toho instructed Honda to proceed with principal photography as planned. The new ending was the first scene to be filmed in Kagoshima Prefecture near Mount Kirishima. However, around the same time, Columbia Pictures denied Toho's request for alterations. Surviving images of the alternate ending appeared in official publicity materials, however, the footage was never developed. While filming the alternate ending, the Nelson dummy used to be plunged into the volcano was later found by locals, who believed it to be a suicide. Authorities retrieved the \\"body\\", which led to Honda and his crew to be \\"roundly scolded\\".Memories of Ishiro Honda. Twenty Years After The Passing Of Godzilla's Famed Director by Hajime Ishida. Famous Monsters of Filmland #269. Movieland Classics LLC, 2013. Pg. 20 Release =Marketing= Columbia Pictures' trailer did not reveal Mothra and mainly focused on the Shobijin and their mysterious link to Mothra. The synopsis used for the film's American press book was based on the original story rather than the final film. The summary even refers to the Shobijin as the \\"Ailenas\\". Columbia's press book advised theater owners to add police or armed services and a weapons display in the lobby with the caption \\"These weapons couldn't stop Mothra!\\"; To put signs on construction sites with the caption \\"Mothra was here!\\"; Send two attractive street valley girls in abbreviated space suits through the main business district and school vicinities with signs on their backs reading \\"Mothra, the world's most fantastic love story!\\"; Arrange a display of radioactive materials with a geiger counter in the lobby to emphasize Mothra's power. =Theatrical= Mothra was released in Japan on July 30, 1961 where it was distributed by Toho. The film was ranked 10th place in Kinema Junpo's annual box office tally. The film was released by Columbia Pictures with an English dub produced by Titra Studios on May 10, 1962. Columbia released Mothra on a double-bill with The Three Stooges in Orbit in some markets. The American version runs at 90 minutes. Columbia acquired the North American rights to the film during pre-production. The film has been re-released theatrically in Japan since its release. This includes a shorter version of the film distributed by Toho with a 62-minute running time on December 14, 1974. This version was edited by Ishiro Honda. Mothra was re-released theatrically in Japan on November 21, 1982 as part of Toho's 50th anniversary. Hiroshi Koizumi believes the success of the film was attributed to the Peanuts' involvement, due to the twins being popular at the time of the film's release. =Critical response= Film critic A. H. Weiler in The New York Times gave the film a generally positive review, singling out the color and special effects for praise. \\"There's that color, as pretty as can be, that now and then smites the eye with some genuinely artistic panoramas and d√©cor designs.\\" Hazel Flynn of the Los Angeles Citizen News stated, \\"the sight of the huge flying monster flapping its wings is one of the most impressive special effects I've ever encountered.\\" Boxoffice magazine called the film \\"one of the best of its kind.\\" A reviewer for Variety called the film \\"ludicrous\\" and \\"half hazardly executed\\", stating, \\"the post-dubbed film is too awkward in dramatic construction and crude in histrionic style to score appreciably at the box office.\\" =Home media= In 2009, the Japanese and American versions of Mothra were released on DVD by Sony Pictures Home Entertainment through their Icons of Sci-fi: Toho Collection set. In 2019, Mill Creek Entertainment released the Japanese and American versions on a steelbook Blu-ray, under licence from Sony. Legacy In 1961, Frankie Sakai and a Mothra prop made a cameo appearance in Cheers, Mr. Awamori. Author Steve Ryfle notes that The Song of Mothra has become a pop culture reference, stating, \\"even many people who've never seen this movie seem to have heard the song.\\" Between 1996 and 1998, Toho produced a trilogy of Mothra films for a family friendly audience.

The technique's development is credited, by the International Swimming Hall of Fame, to Al Vande Weghe at the AAU Nationals in 1934. Previously this entry erroneously credited the invention of the flip turn to University of Texas swim coach Tex Robertson while he was training Adolph Kiefer for the 1936 Olympics. Flip turns are only permitted during freestyle and backstroke races. In butterfly and breaststroke races, regulations require swimmers to touch the end of the pool with both hands simultaneously before turning back for another length. This style of turning is called an open turn. If the event is medley swimming turns vary based on the combination order of what stroke the swimmer is changing from and to. According to the USA Swimming Stroke and Turn Regulations, in order of the strokes the turns are to be: # Butterfly to backstroke is a two-hand touch open turn. Once a legal touch has been made, the swimmer may turn in any manner, but the shoulders must be at or past vertical towards the back when the swimmer leaves the wall. # Backstroke to breaststroke the swimmer must first touch on their back. Once a legal touch has been made, the swimmer may turn in any manner. # Breaststroke to freestyle is two hand touch open turn. Once a legal touch has been made, the swimmer may turn in any manner.

The action game takes the player through various city locations, battling an assortment of minor thugs, animals, and a supervillain (Mysterio, Green Goblin, Scorpion, Rhino, Dr. Octopus, Venom) at the end of each level who, through intermission scenes, will taunt Spider-Man as to the whereabouts of his wife.UGO.com Spider-Man Game Guide Gameplay A typical left-to-right panning interlude between levels. Spider-Man is on the left and Scorpion on the right. One of the wallcrawling sections. Spider-Man has three extra lives and three continues. The intermission scenes between each level feature Spider-Man trading catchy barbs with a supervillain on a cell phone or walkie-talkie to find out where he should go next. Spider-Man can jump a normal and a double height. When he double-jumps, he can swing on a web. This can only be done for a short time until the web-meter runs out. Spider-Man's primary standing attack is a punch to the jaw. While crouching, Spider-Man can do a low, side kick. While jumping in the air, Spider-Man can do a side kick. While standing still, Spider-Man can shoot a glob of webbing from his wrists. This slightly depletes his web- meter. In the two vertical levels, Spider-Man climbs up the side of a building, and will \\"buzz\\" with his spider sense, indicating that the player should move Spider-Man out of the way of possible falling objects. Web vials are used to restore Spider-Man's web-meter, since his webbing is in limited supply. They are dropped by henchmen throughout the levels. Hamburgers restore some of Spider-Man's health meter.

UPPCO joined a coalition lead by Wisconsin Public Service Corporation (WPS) in 1961 to create a coordination of electrical service providers in Upper Michigan and Wisconsin. Through this agreement, the Wisconsin-Upper Michigan System (WUMS) was created with the ultimate goal of increasing the electrical grid resiliency by coordinating operational tasks such as equipment maintenance and construction of infrastructure facilities. In 1994, Wisconsin Public Service Corporation (WPS) formed the WPS Resources Corporation which became the holding company most partnered electric utility providers (excluding UPPCO) operated under at the time. UPPCO was eventually acquired by the holding company in 1998. In 2007, UPPCO negotiated a separation from Integrys Energy Group (the new holding company resulting from a merger between WPS Resources Corporation and Peoples Energy Corp.).

The band was formed in 2002 by former Fenix TX members Will Salazar and Chris Lewis, along with F.O.N. members Aaron Rubin and Ilan Rubin. After self-releasing their debut EP Extended Play in 2003, they were temporarily signed to Universal Records, who released their 2004 full-length album Scenic.  History  In 2002, after breaking up their band of seven years due to musical differences, Fenix TX singer/guitarist Will Salazar and the remaining three Fenix TX members went separate ways. While Salazar wanted to keep the band going (but was not legally allowed to), bassist Adam Lewis and drummer Damon DeLaPaz decided to extend their side-project Big Black Boat, which later changed its name to ChChCh HaHaHa and ultimately became the band I Sing the Body Electric. Guitarist Chris Lewis was caught in between, as he was asked to take part in Big Black Boat but also wanted to continue working with Salazar, and finally settled for a position alongside Salazar. Joined by F.O.N. members and brothers Aaron Rubin on bass and Ilan Rubin on drums ‚Äì the latter of which was a prot√©g√© of Blink-182 drummer and reality TV star Travis Barker ‚Äî the duo formed Denver Harbor in December 2002, three months after Fenix TX broke up. The band made its stage debut on March 14, 2003 at The Scene in San Diego, California. They recorded three songs in their home studio (\\"All I Want\\", \\"Move On\\" and a cover version of Avril Lavigne's \\"I'm with You\\"), that were uploaded onto MP3.com to help spread the word. Within weeks, they had a solid fanbase, mainly former Fenix TX fans. Following a stint of intimate club shows, Denver Harbor returned to the recording studio with producer Joe Marlett, to work on the songs that would become their debut EP Extended Play (2003). Fans voted the EP's single \\"Outta My Head\\" to the top of KEDJ 103.9 The Edge's online chart, securing the band a spot in front of a crowd of 20,000 on the radio station's Edgefest, hosted on September 20, 2003. Extended Play was released under the band's own imprint, called Angry Pirate Records, on December 16, 2003. Throughout 2003 and 2004, the release was promoted by tours with Sugarcult, Story of the Year, Me First and the Gimme Gimmes and Flogging Molly, helping the CD's first print run to sell out within half a year. In June 2004, the band was signed by Universal Records. The band released their full-length debut Scenic on October 12, 2004. Musically, the album was much more diverse than Fenix TX's material, with influences ranging from post-grunge to reggae to pop rock, although the band's pop punk roots were also clearly audible. However, due to Universal's lack of promotion, the album did not manage to chart the Billboard 200, which ultimately led to the label dropping the band exactly one year after their signing. After that, things quieted down around the quartet until in September 2005, Fenix TX reunited for a final tour. While Fenix TX and Allister co-headlined the tour, Day at the Fair, Houston Calls and Denver Harbor supported, which meant that Salazar, Chris Lewis and eventually Ilan Rubin ‚Äì who would replace Fenix TX drummer DeLaPaz halfway through the tour ‚Äì had to play two sets every night. Denver Harbor finally went their separate ways in 2006. Drummer Ilan Rubin then went on to play for Welsh alternative metal band Lostprophets before becoming drummer for Nine Inch Nails.

Gordon III (April 10, 1928 ‚Äì July 11, 2002) was an American blues singer, pianist, and songwriter. He is best known for his hit songs \\"Booted,\\" (1952), \\"No More Doggin'\\" (1952), and \\"Just a Little Bit\\" (1960). Gordon was a pioneer of the Memphis blues style. He played piano in a style known as the \\"Rosco rhythm,\\" with the emphasis on the off-beat. This rhythm was an influence on later musical styles. Biography Gordon was born in Memphis, Tennessee on April 10, 1928, the youngest of eight children. He learned to play piano from his sister who took lessons. Gordon became associated with Johnny Ace, Bobby Bland and B.B. King, sometimes referred to as the Beale Streeters. In 1946, Gordon moved to Chicago \\"after getting in trouble in Memphis.\\" He returned to Memphis in 1949, and won first place at an amateur show at the Palace Theatre on Beale Street in 1950. Emcee of the show Rufus Thomas invited Gordon to play on his radio show at WDIA. Soon after, Gordon had his own show as well. In 1951, WDIA manager, David Mattis, introduced Gordon to producer Sam Phillips. Around this time, Gordon was scouted by Ike Turner, talent scout for the Bihari brothers, to record for Modern Records. His first hit single, \\"Saddled the Cow (and Milk the Horse),\\" released on RPM Records (subsidiary of Modern) reached No. 9 on the Billboard R&B; chart. Gordon's next single \\"Booted\\" was recorded at Phillips' Memphis Recording Service. Phillips licensed the record to the Chess brothers at Chess Records, which was released as a single in December 1951. Gordon also recorded a version for the Biharis brothers at RPM, released in January 1952. The RPM release reached number-one on the Billboard R&B; record chart in March 1952. The Chess and the Bihari brothers later settled the conflict, with the Biharis getting exclusive rights to Gordon and Chess signing Howlin' Wolf to an exclusive contract. For years, Gordon did not receive royalties for his songs. \\"Sam Phillips gave me one hundred dollars. One hundred. No royalties. No nothin'. But, I did it for the Biharis, now they gave me six hundred dollars. No royalties. No nothin'. But like I say, I didn't know any better,\\" he said. Gordon also had a successful record with \\"No More Doggin'\\" (No. 2 R&B;) which was also released by RPM in 1952. Between 1952 and 1959, Gordon released numerous singles on Duke, Sun, Flip, and Vee-Jay Records. His last single to reach the charts was \\"Just a Little Bit\\" (#No. R&B;, No. 64 Pop) in 1960. He was paid $250 for the song which became an R&B; standard, covered by the Beatles, Etta James, Elvis Presley, and Jerry Butler. Gordon didn't receive royalties from the millions of copies sold in cover versions, because producer Ralph Bass at King Records stole the song from a demo Rosco sent and had it copyrighted before him. In the late 1950s, Gordon toured internationally, reaching South America and the Caribbean, where his off-beat rhythmic technique influenced the sound of early ska and reggae. In 1962, Gordon quit the music industry and moved to Queens, New York with his new wife, where he purchased a partnership in a laundry business after winning a poker game with a pair of deuces. In 1969, Gordon formed his own label, Bab-Roc, operated from his home, but he did not perform again until 1981. In 1983, he released the album Rosco Rocks Again, recorded live at the 100 Club in London. Following his wife's death in 1984, he returned to touring. In 2000, Gordon teamed up with blues guitarist Duke Robillard to release the album Memphis Tennessee. In 2002, Gordon was invited by the filmmaker Richard Pearce to be included in a documentary film about several blues musicians returning to Memphis for a tribute to Sam Phillips in conjunction with the May 2002 W.C. Handy Awards. The documentary, The Road to Memphis, aired on PBS television. Six weeks after filming finished, Gordon died at the age of 74 from a heart attack at his apartment in Rego Park, Queens on July 11, 2002. He was survived by three daughters, Victoria, Deborah, and Ruby; three sons, Marrc, Rosco III, and Keith; a sister, Ella Gordon Jefferson; and 10 grandchildren. He was interred in the Rosedale Cemetery in Linden, New Jersey. On June 25, 2019, The New York Times Magazine listed Rosco Gordon among hundreds of artists whose material was reportedly destroyed in the 2008 Universal fire.

The reigning champions are La Alianza de Plata y Oro (\\"The Silver and Gold Alliance\\"; Car√≠stico and M√≠stico), having defeated Los Guerreros Laguneros (Euforia and Gran Guerrero), on November 1, 2019 at D√≠a de Muertos. They are the 42nd overall champions in their first reign together. Los Guerreros de la Atlantida (Drag√≥n Rojo Jr. and √öltimo Guerrero) hold the record for the longest reign as a team, at 640 days. √öltimo Guerrero and Rey Bucanero hold the record for the longest combined reigns of any team: 1,185 days divided over three reigns. Individually, √öltimo Guerrero has held the championship six times for a total of 1,923 days, the longest of any individual. The team of √öltimo Guerrero and Dr. Wagner Jr. held the championship for seven days, the shortest reign of any championship team. Casas and √öltimo Guerrero have the most title reigns with six each, while the combinations of Casas and El Hijo del Santo, √öltimo Guerrero and Rey Bucanero and Averno and Mephisto are the only teams to have won the championship three times. The championship has been declared vacant on a number of occasions, either because of an injury to one of the champions or because a wrestler stopped working for CMLL for a period of time. The championship has been held up once, based on the inconclusive outcome of a match, being vacant for a week until the two teams had a rematch. CMLL has also held a couple of tournaments designed to give the winners of the tournament a match against the champions, declaring them the official number one contender for the champions. History Canek, half of the first championship team.alt=A picture of the masked wrestler El Canek giving a young fan an autograph. Starting in 1957 the Mexican Lucha libre, or professional wrestling, promotion Empresa Mexicana de Lucha Libre (\\"Mexican Wrestling Enterprise\\"; EMLL) began promoting the Mexican National Tag Team Championship as the top championship of their tag team division. In 1991 EMLL was rebranded Consejo Mundial de Lucha Libre (\\"World Wrestling Council\\"; CMLL) after the promotion left the National Wrestling Alliance in the late 1980s.{{efnMadigan (2007) p. 32: \\"in the late 1980s EMLL withdrew from the National Wrestling Alliance\\" In 1992 then-CMLL executive Antonio Pe√±a left CMLL along with a number of the promotion's wrestlers to form Asistencia Asesor√≠a y Administraci√≥n (AAA). Among the wrestlers that left CMLL were then-reigning Mexican National Tag Team Champions Misterioso and Volador. The Mexican National Tag Team Championship was not owned by CMLL but rather by the Mexico City Boxing and Wrestling Commission and the commission allowed AAA to take control of the championship. In early 1993 CMLL decided to create their own tag team championship to replace the Mexican National Tag Team Championship and introduced the CMLL World Tag Team Championship. The team of Canek and Dr. Wagner Jr. faced off against Vampiro Canadiense and Pierroth Jr. in the finals of a 16-team tournament to determine the first champions, with Canek and Wagner Jr. winning the match to become the first tag team champions. The duo would hold the title until El Canek left CMLL in November 1994. CMLL held a 32-team tournament from November 11 to December 16, 1994. In the finals \\"Los Cowboys\\" (Silver King and El Texano) defeated El Sat√°nico and Emilio Charles Jr. to become the second ever CMLL World Tag Team Champions. Six months later Los Cowboys would lose the title to their longtime rivals los Headhunters. In September 1996 the champions, the team of Atlantis and Lizmark, were stripped of the championship after an inconclusive match against Los Headhunters. In the subsequent eight- team tournament brothers Silver King and Dr. Wagner Jr. captured the title with a victory over Dos Caras and √öltimo Drag√≥n. The title would be vacated once again only six months later as Silver King left CMLL to work for World Championship Wrestling (WCW). Dr. Wagner Jr. teamed up with Emilio Charles Jr. and the two former champions won an eight-team tournament in August 1997. The title would be vacated once again in 1998 when one half of the tag team champions, Mr. Niebla, was injured. Bestia Salvaje and Emilio Charles Jr. became champions by winning an 8-team tournament and began working a storyline with the team of Negro Casas and El Hijo del Santo, whom they traded the title back and forth with over the next year. In early 1999 El Hijo del Santo left CMLL forcing them to vacate the title once again. Los Guerreros del Infierno (\\"The Warriors from the Inferno\\"; √öltimo Guerrero and Rey Bucanero) defeated Mr. Niebla and Villano IV in a tournament final bringing some stability to the title as they have not been vacated since then. Guerrero and Bucanero have held the title three times since then and Guerrero has teamed with Dr. Wagner Jr. and Atlantis to win the championship twice more. CMLL held a number one contender's tournament in both 2008 and in 2013, using the tournament to build the credibility of the tournament winners. Both the 2008 winners, Averno and Mephisto, and the 2013 winners, Rush and La M√°scara would go on to win the championship. In 2000 CMLL revived the CMLL Arena Coliseo Tag Team Championship after it had been dormant since the 1980s. The title became a secondary tag team championship for CMLL, primarily for younger, lower ranked wrestlers. The Guadalajara branch of CMLL has intermittently promoted the Occidente (western) tag team championship, a local championship that is not defended outside the Mexican state of Jalisco.{{efnFuego en el Ring (February 28, 2015): \\"Emocionante combate por los Campeonatos de parejas de Occidente en el que los hasta entonces campeones Boby Zavala y Ol√≠mpico expusieron sus cetros ante los retadores Esfinge y El Gallo con El Gallito\\" (\\"Exciting match for the Occidente Tag Team Championships in which the until-then-champions Boby Zavala and Ol√≠mpico lost the title to challengers Esfinge and El Gallo with El Gallito.\\") Reigns alt=A photo of wrestler Negro Casas in a wrestling ring during an outdoor wrestling event. The current champions areLa Alianza de Plata y Oro (Car√≠stico and M√≠stico), the team won the championship on November 1, 2019 by defeating Los Guerreros Laguneros (Euforia and Gran Guerrero) at D√≠a de Muertos.Car√≠stico and M√≠stico are the 42nd overall champions in their first reign. Negro Casas and √öltimo Guerrero share the record for individual reigns with six, and three teams are tied for most title reigns as a team with Guerrero and Rey Bucanero, Averno and Mephisto and Negro Casas and Hijo del Santo, who all have three reigns. Los Guerreros de la Atlantida (Drag√≥n Rojo Jr. and √öltimo Guerrero) held the title for 640 days, which is the longest reign of any team while √öltimo Guerrero's six reign combine to 1,923 days. √öltimo Guerrero and Dr. Wagner Jr. held the title for seven days and are thus the team with the shortest reign to date. CMLL has been forced to declare the championship vacant on eight different occasions since its creation in 1993, which meant that there were no champions for a period of time. The title has been declared vacant twice because one of the champions (El Canek and Silver King respectively) left CMLL, and four times due to a major injury to one of the champions. On one occasion CMLL held up the championship, vacating the championship until a rematch between the teams of M√≠stico/H√©ctor Garza and Averno/Mephisto, a match that M√≠stico and H√©ctor Garza won to become two-times champions. On February 5, 1999, El Hijo del Santo and Negro Casas defeated Bestia Salvaje and Scorpio Jr. by disqualification, which in CMLL meant that they also won the championship. Casas and Hijo del Santo refused to win the championship in that matter, vacating the championship until the two teams could have a rematch. Casas and Hijo del Santo won the rematch without controversy to win the championship once more. As the CMLL World Tag Team Championship is a professional wrestling championship, it is not actually won or lost competitively but instead, championship changes are decided by the officials and the bookers of CMLL. The title is awarded after the chosen team \\"wins\\" a match to maintain the illusion that professional wrestling is a competitive sport. Championship matches usually take place under best two-out-of-three falls rules. On occasion single fall title matches have taken place, especially when promoting CMLL title matches in Japan, conforming to the traditions of the local promotion. An example of this was when Bushi won the CMLL World Welterweight Championship in a one-fall match on a New Japan Pro Wrestling show in 2015. Tournaments =1993= The CMLL World Tag Team Championship was the last of the CMLL branded championships to be created in the years immediately following the name change to Consejo Mundial de Lucha Libre. Until early 1993 the Mexican National Tag Team Championship had served as the main tag team title, but the title moved to AAA when the champions left CMLL to jump to AAA leaving CMLL without a tag team championship. CMLL co-promoted the tournament with the Universal Wrestling Association (UWA), holding the tournament spread out over several CMLL and UWA shows, the tournament started on February 26, 1993 featuring wrestlers from both promotions. The finals were spread out over three shows, with one fall of the match on each of the shows. The finals started place on March 19 on a CMLL show, followed by a second match on March 21 at a UWA show, and the third and final match on March 26 on CMLL's Super Viernes show. The tournament was won by Dr. Wagner Jr. a CMLL regular, and El Canek who had been synonymous with the UWA for over a decade at that point in time. ;Tournament bracket =1994= In the summer of 1994 El Canek was planning on leaving CMLL, which meant that CMLL had to make plans for the tag team championship that Canek held at the time alongside Dr. Wagner Jr. The decision was made to hold a 16-team tournament to determine the next champions. The tournament started on July 22, 1994 and ran until August 5. As it turned out El Canek stayed in CMLL longer than expected and was still working for them by the time El Texano and Silver King won the tournament. CMLL named the winning team the \\"number one contenders\\", but before they got a chance to wrestle against Canek and Dr. Wagner Jr., Canek left CMLL. Without a championship team to defend against El Texano and Silver King CMLL organized a second 16-team tournament to determine who would wrestle the previous tournament winners for the vacant championship. The second tournament, which ran from November 18 until December 2 featured several wrestlers that also competed in the first tournament, most with different partners. The second tournament was won by El Sat√°nico and Emilio Charles Jr., who ended up losing to El Texano and Silver King on December 16, 1994. With their victory El Texano and Silver King became the second CMLL Tag Team Champions. ;Number 1 Contenders tournament ;Number 2 Contenders tournament =February 1997= alt=The masked wrestler Dr. Wagner Jr. posing in the ring after a wrestling match. On October 25, 1996 Los Headhunters defeated then reigning CMLL World Tag Team Champions Atlantis and Lizmark to win the titles. After the match was over Los Headhunters continued to attack both of their opponents, which led to the referee disqualifying the team, negating the championship change. Los Headhunters took the championship belts with them, ignoring that they were not actually the champions. The storyline was that the team declared themselves the tag team champions, but CMLL did not have the same opinion, declaring the titles vacant instead. CMLL followed up the decision to vacate the championship by holding an eight-team tournament that spanned their February 21 and February 28, 1997 Super Viernes shows. In the end, the brother team of Dr. Wagner Jr. and Silver King defeated Dos Caras and √öltimo Drag√≥n to become the seventh overall champions. ;Tournament bracket =August 1997= The team of Silver King and Dr. Wagner Jr. had held the championship since winning a tournament on February 2, 1997, but in August, 1997 Silver King left CMLL to work for Promo Azteca and the U.S. based World Championship Wrestling (WCW). CMLL held a two-night, eight-team tournament to fill the void left by Silver King leaving. The finals took place on August 29, where Dr. Wagner Jr. and his new partner Emilio Charles Jr. defeated Los Headhunters to become the eight overall champions. ;Tournament brackets =1998= In the fall of 1998 Mr. Niebla suffered an injury while holding the CMLL World Tag Team Championship with Shocker. Due to the injury Mr. Niebla was unable to compete so CMLL declared the championship vacant and put together an eight-team tournament to crown new champions. The tournament started on October 30 and lasted until November 13 where the team of Bestia Salvaje and Scorpio Jr. defeated El Sat√°nico and Dr. Wagner Jr. to become the tenth over all tag team champions. ;Tournament brackets =2000= On June 16, 2000 the CMLL World Tag Team Championship was announced as vacant. The official explanation was that co- champion Negro Casas voluntarily gave up the championship to \\"give other teams a chance\\", but in reality his partner, El Hijo del Santo, had stopped working for CMLL. CMLL organized a 16-team tournament from June 23 through August 4, 2000, with the finals being at CMLL's Entre Torre Infernal pay-per-view. The finals of the tournament was set to be Los Infernales (\\"The Infernal Ones\\"; Rey Bucanero and √öltimo Guerrero) against the team of Emilio Charles Jr. and Mr. Niebla but Emilio Charles Jr. had suffered an injury before the show began. As a result, Los Infernales were declared the new champions. The team was then ordered to defend the championship against Mr. Niebla and his new partner Villano IV so there was still a championship match on the show. Los Infernales retained the championship. They later successfully defended against Mr. Niebla and Emilio Charles Jr. on August 18, 2000. ;Tournament brackets =Number one contenders tournament 2008= In January 2008 CMLL put together a 16-team tournament to determine which team would get a title match against then-champions Atlantis and √öltimo Guerrero. The tournament took place over three weeks, with two qualifying blocks and then the final match in the third week. The finals saw former CMLL World Tag Team Champions Los Hijos del Averno (\\"The Sons of Hell\\"; Averno and Mephisto) defeating the team of Dos Caras Jr. and La Sombra. On February 1, 2008 Averno and Mephisto defeated Atlantis and √öltimo Guerrero to become the 25th overall champions. ;Tournament brackets =Number one contenders tournament 2013= La M√°scara, who teamed up with Rush to win the tournament.alt=Masked wrestler La M√°scara posing on the ropes before a match. In September, 2013 CMLL arranged a 16-team tournament to determine which duo would be next in line to get a match for the CMLL World Tag Team Championship. In the end, the team of La M√°scara and Rush defeated the team of Atlantis and La Sombra. The duo would be awarded the championship on September 18, 2013 when champions Rey Bucanero and Tama Tonga were unable to defend the title due to Bucanero being injured. Months later La M√°scara, Rush and La Sombra formed Los Ingobernables during La M√°scara and Rush's tag team title reign. ;Tournament brackets =2018= On February 7, 2018 CMLL announced that they had stripped then-champions Negro Casas and Shocker of the championship due to a lack of championship defenses. The team had not defended the championship since October 11, 2016, a total of days without a championship match. CMLL held a 16 team tournament starting on Friday March 2 and is slated to end on March 16 at CMLL's annual Homenaje a Dos Leyendas show.

Biography Born in Paris, the son of Charles Colbert, Louis's minister of foreign affairs and the nephew of le grand Colbert, Louis' chief advisor, for whom the Torcy title was created, Colbert de Torcy was a brilliant and precocious legal student. As a very young man, he assisted his father in sensitive diplomatic missions. Colbert de Torcy proved himself so able that in 1689, Louis XIV granted him the right to succeed to his father's position as minister of foreign affairs, a position he fulfilled from 28 July 1696 to 23 September 1715. He was the guiding spirit of French diplomacy at the series of international conferences that resulted in the Treaty of Utrecht (1713) and the Treaty of Rastatt (1714) and was concerned with professionalizing the conduct of diplomacy. He instituted an acad√©mie politique to train young professionals in the equivalent of a foreign service bureaucracy: it did not survive his retirement, but his establishment at Versailles of a centralized diplomatic archive (1710) has been a service to historians. Louis XIV was his foreign relation. The aged king, recognizing that Colbert de Torcy had been a de facto secretary of state, named him such in his will, but when Louis died in 1715, his will was broken; the Regent, Philippe, Duke of Orl√©ans deprived Colbert de Torcy of any political power, and he settled into a long retirement, during which he was a member of the unofficial political salon called the Entresol, which formed in the early years of Louis XV's maturity when the abb√© Alary, a prot√©g√© of Fleury, convened an occasional political discussion group in the entresol of his apartment in Place Vend√¥me. There in sociable surroundings, sharing the gossip and news Colbert de Torcy debated contemporary events in a sympathetic circle and like others, doubtless read aloud and elicited comment upon the political writings. The architect Germain Boffrand had built a series of h√¥tels particuliers in the new district, the Faubourg Saint-Honor√©, and Colbert de Torcy purchased one as a semi-finished shell, 14 November 1715, which he finished as a suitable Paris residence, the h√¥tel de Torcy (later the h√¥tel de Beauharnais, now the German Embassy 78, rue de Lille). There his magnificent installation among his tapestries, furnishings paintings, Chinese porcelains mounted in gilt-bronze, sculptures and other works of art above all in his cabinet dor√©, giving onto the salon that was lit from both sides, provided him solace and comfort in a long and productive retirement, in which he completed his M√©moirs pour servir √† l'histoire des n√©gotiations depuis le Trait√© de Riswick jusqu'√† la Paix d'Utrecht, published in 1756. Colbert de Torcy died at Paris in 1746. His official portrait was painted by Hyacinthe Rigaud. Colbert de Torcy is commemorated in the rue de Torcy, Paris XVIII√®me .

Arthur Hastings chronicles Hercule Poirot's unravelling of the mystery. \\"How Does Your Garden Grow?\\" is a line from the nursery rhyme \\"Mary, Mary, Quite Contrary\\", which Poirot is reminded of when visiting a country house with a beautifully maintained garden whose mistress has just died ‚Äì after writing a cryptic letter requesting his help. The \\"Problem at Pollensa Bay\\" concerns a mother's dislike for her son's fianc√©e. The problem is solved (non-violently) by fellow vacationer Parker Pyne. In \\"Yellow Iris\\", Poirot follows an anonymous phone call to a restaurant table laden with the favourite flower of a woman who died mysteriously four years before. This story was expanded and made into the full-length mystery \\"Sparkling Cyanide\\", featuring Colonel Race instead of Poirot. \\"Miss Marple Tells a Story\\" is written in the first person by the elderly sleuth, who recalls solving (without leaving her own chair) a seemingly impossible murder.

Early life Sarkis was born in Diyana, Erbil Governorate of Iraqi Kurdistan in 1962. He is an Assyrian with family origins from the Nochiya tribe. He was first elected into the Kurdistan National Assembly in the first Iraqi Kurdistan elections in 1992, beginning his political career. Sarkis Aghajan Mamendo was also the Minister for Finance and the Economy from 1999 to 2006, and Deputy Prime Minister from 2004 to 2006 in the Arbil and Dohuk administration. Aghajan appears to owe his ascendancy within the Kurdistan Democratic Party power structure to his personal relationship with Nechervan Idris Barzani, the Kurdish prime minister. His supporters say that as young men, the two were forced to flee Iraq with their families in 1975 after the United States withdrew its support of the Barzani clan, and so Nechervan grew up with Sarkis on the Aghajan family estate in Iran.  Activities  Sarkis is known, in addition to his political roles, for massive development and aid programs he has begun in which he built or repaired dozens of Churches, roads, schools and Assyrian settlements throughout northern Iraq through the \\"Higher Committee for Christian Affairs\\" that he established. He is also a major funder and owner of the new Assyrian TV channel Ishtar TV, which is broadcast in three languages (Syriac, Arabic, and Kurdish).  Awards and controversies  In August 2006, Sarkis was awarded the \\"Knight Commander of the order of Saint Gregory the Great\\" by Pope Benedict XVI as a way to honour his work helping the Assyrian Christian community in Iraq.ŸÇÿØÿßÿ≥ÿ© ÿßŸÑÿ®ÿßÿ®ÿß ÿ®ŸäŸÜÿØŸÉÿ™ÿ≥ ÿßŸÑÿ≥ÿßÿØÿ≥ ÿπÿ¥ÿ± ŸäŸÖŸÜÿ≠ Ÿàÿ≥ÿßŸÖ ÿßŸÑŸÇÿßÿ¶ÿØ ŸàÿßŸÑŸÅÿßÿ±ÿ≥ ŸÑŸÑÿ≥ŸäÿØ ÿ≥ÿ±ŸÉŸäÿ≥ ÿ£ÿ∫ÿß ÿ¨ÿßŸÜ Aghajan was awarded the title, which is one of the highest and most widely recognized pontifical orders, for his contribution to the Assyrian community and his work for Christians in Iraq. Many Assyrian non-governmental organizations claim that the Kurdistan Regional Government only appointed Aghajan to a high office in the Kurdish government in order to look tolerant towards Assyrians so that they could justify a possible annexation of Assyrian settlements in the Nineveh plains. It has also been speculated that he gets some of his funding from lobbying efforts in the United States by the Assyrian American congresswoman Anna Eshoo for the purpose of rebuilding Assyrian settlements,https://www.congress.gov/amendment/109th-congress/house- amendment/483/actions although he personally claims that the money is raised by Kurdish political parties instead.ÿ≥ÿ±ŸÉŸäÿ≥ ÿßÿ∫ÿßÿ¨ÿßŸÜ ŸÑÿ¨ÿ±ŸäÿØÿ© ŸÜÿßÿ¥ŸäŸàŸÜÿßŸÑ ÿßŸÑÿ•ŸÖÿßÿ±ÿßÿ™Ÿäÿ©ÿõ ÿßŸÑÿßŸÖŸàÿßŸÑ ÿßŸÑÿ™Ÿä ÿ™ÿµÿ±ŸÅ ÿπŸÑŸâ ŸÖÿ≥ÿßÿπÿØÿ© ÿßŸÑŸÖÿ≥Ÿäÿ≠ŸäŸäŸÜ ÿßŸÑÿπÿ±ÿßŸÇŸäŸäŸÜ ŸáŸä ÿßŸÖŸàÿßŸÑ ÿ≠ŸÉŸàŸÖÿ© ÿßŸÇŸÑŸäŸÖ ŸÉÿ±ÿØÿ≥ÿ™ÿßŸÜÿå ÿµŸàÿ™ ÿßŸÑÿπÿ±ÿßŸÇ He also finances his own militia which is accused of assaulting Assyrian candidates during the 2009 Governorates Elections in Nineveh. ÿßÿ≥ÿ™ŸáÿØÿßŸÅ ŸÖÿØŸäÿ± ÿßŸÑÿ≠ŸÖŸÑÿ© ÿßŸÑÿßŸÜÿ™ÿÆÿßÿ®Ÿäÿ© ŸÑŸÇÿßÿ¶ŸÖÿ© ÿßŸÑÿ±ÿßŸÅÿØŸäŸÜ 504], Zahrira Disappearance and reappearance For a period during 2008-2009 the Assyrian Finance minister went missing. Many people believed that he was kidnapped or the victim of assassination. Part of this speculation was due to the fact that around the same period he went missing more than 20,000 Assyrian had been displaced and 13 killed in Mosul as part of a pogrom in 2008, and there were rumors of Corruption in the Kurdistan government, and as finance minister he might have been aware of it, leading to speculation that he might have been killed to cover it up.Mystery Surrounds Disappearance of Assyrian Finance Minister, AINA However, after going missing, a new finance minister was appointed,http://www.krg.org/articles/detail.asp?rnr=136&lngnr;=12&anr;=11177&smap;=04060100 and then shortly after being replaced he was found again in the summer of 2009, when he appeared in his palace in Ankawa in what he claimed to be a medical vacation outside the country. He stopped giving funds to Assyrian Christian Communities, causing the Chaldean Catholic Church to have significant financial issues during the financial crisis of 2007‚Äì2008, and as a result it was forced to sell land it held in the center of Baghdad.

Surfer's ear is not the same as swimmer's ear, although infection can result as a side effect. Irritation from cold wind and water exposure causes the bone surrounding the ear canal to develop lumps of new bony growth which constrict the ear canal. Where the ear canal is actually blocked by this condition, water and wax can become trapped and give rise to infection. The condition is so named due to its prevalence among cold water surfers. Warm water surfers are also at risk for exostosis due to the evaporative cooling caused by wind and the presence of water in the ear canal. Most avid surfers have at least some mild bone growths (exostoses), causing little to no problems. The condition is progressive, making it important to take preventive measures early, preferably whenever surfing. The condition is not limited to surfing and can occur in any activity with cold, wet, windy conditions such as windsurfing, kayaking, sailing, jet skiing, kitesurfing, and diving. Signs and symptoms In general one ear will be somewhat worse than the other due to the prevailing wind direction of the area surfed or the side that most often strikes the wave first. *Decreased hearing or hearing loss, temporary or ongoing *Increased prevalence of ear infections, causing ear pain *Difficulty evacuating debris or water from the ear causing a plugging sensation Image:Normal canal Image001.jpgNormal ear canal Image:Normal canal 2 Image001.jpgNormal ear canal Image:Exostosis Image001.jpgExostosis in ear canal Image:Exostosis Image002.jpgExostosis in ear canal Cause The majority of patients present in their mid-30s to late 40s. This is likely due to a combination of the slow growth of the bone and the decreased participation in activities associated with surfer's ear past the 30s. However surfer's ear is possible at any age and is directly proportional to the amount of time spent in cold, wet, windy weather without adequate protection. The normal ear canal is approximately 7 mm in diameter and has a volume of approximately 0.8 ml (approximately one-sixth of a teaspoon).Ojala K, Sorri M, Sipila P, Vainio-Mattila J. Correlation of postoperative ear canal volumes with obliteration material and with volume of operation cavity.Arch Otorhinolaryngol 1982; 234: 37-43. As the condition progresses the diameter narrows and can even close completely if untreated, although sufferers generally seek help once the passage has constricted to 0.5-2 mm due to the noticeable hearing impairment. While not necessarily harmful in and of itself, constriction of the ear canal from these growths can trap debris, leading to painful and difficult to treat infections. Prevention The widespread use of wetsuits has allowed people to surf in much colder waters, which has increased the incidence and severity of surfer's ear for people who do not properly protect their ears. *Avoid activity during extremely cold or windy conditions. *Keep the ear canal as warm and dry as possible. **Ear plugs **Wetsuit hood **Swim cap **Diving helmet Treatment Surgery to remove the obstructing ear canal bone is usually performed under general anesthesia in an operating room and aided by the use of a binocular microscope. Most ear surgeons use a drill to remove the bone and may approach the area directly via the ear canal or by making an incision behind the ear and dissecting the ear forward. In using a drilling technique it is important to keep the thin inner ear canal skin away from the drill to preserve the skin and allow optimal skin coverage at the conclusion of the surgery. Some doctors now prefer to use 1 millimeter chisels to remove the obstructing bone and enter directly through the ear canal. This technique enhances skin preservation. This technique may, in some cases, be performed under sedation with local anesthesia. During recuperation from surgery it is extremely important not to expose the ear canal to water to minimize the chance of infection or complications. Depending on the condition of the ear canal and the surgical technique used, the ear canal may require several weeks to several months to heal. Unprotected exposure of ear canals to cold water and wind after treatment can lead to regrowth of bone and the need for repeated operations on the same ear.

The group was incorporated on January 31, 1874, by Indiana residents who sought warmer weather after the exceptionally cold winter of 1872‚Äì73. The settlers met in the home of Thomas Elliott, and Daniel Berry was selected to visit Southern California with a direction to find suitable land at a suitable price. Berry visited San Diego, Anaheim, San Fernando, Rancho Santa Anita and Rancho San Pascual. After meeting Judge Benjamin Eaton and Benjamin Davis \\"Don Benito\\" Wilson, he was able to negotiate the purchase of lands in the eastern part of Rancho San Pascual near the Arroyo Seco. The recession of 1873 caused a few initial investors to withdraw from the settlement plans. Berry immediately reincorporated the company into the Southern California Orange Grove Association enlisting any interested party and salvaging the purchasing power of the settlement. The nearly property would become The Indiana Colony, the genesis of present-day Pasadena, California. Reason for moving The midwest of 1873 had been hit by the hardest winter in up-to-date history which had many of those in Indianapolis longing for warmer climate and an environment where they could live among citrus groves and perennial flowers. With the laying of the Transcontinental Railroad in 1869, the idea of moving west became more possible and affordable. It was at the home of Dr. and Mrs. Thomas Elliott that a group of neighbors including Mrs. Elliot's brother, Daniel M. Berry, that the idea of going west was first discussed...adamantly. Berry was a former teacher become journalist who also had a great interest in his brother- in-law's granary. He was also an asthmatic and the midwest weather went hard on him. He contacted Harris Newmark who had recently purchased Rancho Santa Anita and was able to get pertinent information on the southland. Newmark even stopped by Indianapolis and gave a first-hand account of California to the Elliotts et al. From that meeting the Hoosiers formed \\"The California Colony of Indiana\\". It took little time to fill the limited roll of the organizations membership. Next was the task of investigating the California properties. Selection of territory From a committee of four it was Daniel Berry who was left to set off to scout land in Southern California for the group of Indianapolis investors. He visited five regions: San Diego, Anaheim, San Fernando, and Rancho Santa Anita and Rancho San Pascual. He was given a budgetary target of $5 per acre with which to negotiate. San Diego seemed an ideal spot, and the price was right, but a series of windmills would have to be set up to pump water. The Company rejected the idea. Of San Bernardino he said, too hot. Of Anaheim he didn't care for the superabundance of fleas nor the number of \\"musketers\\" (gun toters). Of San Fernando he said, the price at $2 per acre was acceptable, but the area was only good for growing grain. There was too little access to water for citrus growing. The Indianans had their hearts set on orchards. Rancho Santa Anita was the collective lands of today's Arcadia, Monrovia, Duarte, El Monte, and Baldwin Park. The property had absolutely everything required for citrus growing, but at $20 per acre the place was too expensive. On September 12, 1873, Berry met Judge Benjamin Eaton who represented Dr. John S. Griffin of the Fair Oaks Ranch (near east Altadena) on Rancho San Pascual where he had his first good night's sleep in years. He fell in love with Rancho San Pascual, and to keep his find a secret, he attached a cryptic name to the place as \\"Muscat\\" for the grapes that were grown so abundantly over the hillsides.Kyle, Dreams of the Pioneers, published by the Pasadena Museum of History, 1983. Southern California Orange Grove Assoc. The land was being offered for $10 per acre, but there was indecision between Dr. Griffin and Benjamin Wilson on dividing properties. Berry wrote Elliott requesting the money to purchase what he could of Rancho San Pascual. The mail turn around response was two weeks; it was September 19 before the word got to Indiana. The Company decided to step part way to the asking price of Santa Anita with an offer of $15 per acre. This negotiation was never destined to be met, for one, the owner Newmark was not at home; two, the N. Y. Stock Market had been struck by a panic and ruined the financial plans for the Indiana Colony. Elliott retained a few of the original investors and forwarded only $200 as a down payment on $25,000 of Muscat property. Berry turned promoter and selectively enlisted more investors into the company under a new California incorporation, \\"The Southern California Orange Grove Association.\\" He sold 100 shares at $250 per share and salvaged the purchasing power of the company. As Griffin and Wilson settled their land divisions, the association negotiated for a strip of near the Arroyo Seco. Griffin offered an additional which he acquired from Wilson, free of charge and taxes to the Colony as well. It was considered a gesture of good faith, but actually it was the sloughing of what was considered to be worthless highland property that would one day become Altadena. The lower tract of land would become The Indiana Colony.McCloskey. 6 Horses and 10 Head, Boys' Club of Pasadena, 1971. Renaming the colony The name lasted for a while until which point they wanted their own post office. Up to this time, the mail was being brought up from Los Angeles by one resident's son who was going to school there. Mail for the colony came to Los Angeles earmarked for \\"Indiana Colony,\\" but when the community applied for a post office, the Postmaster General rejected the name Indiana Colony. Thus began the search for a new name for the town which would end up being Pasadena.Hiram Reid, Pasadena, out of print, rare book, Pasadena, Cal.: Pasadena History Co., 1895.

They provided two top 40 albums on the related ARIA Albums Chart, Goin' to Pieces (1989) and After the Show (1991). He formed another group, Barker, in 1993, and their single, \\"Time Bomb\\", was listed at No. 20 on Triple J Hottest 100 for 1994. Barker then went solo from 1995. Biography Nicholas Paul Barker left secondary school in the late 1970s and started an apprenticeship in a workshop. He was the bass guitarist for a succession of Melbourne-based bands starting with the Curse during 1980‚Äì1981 and 1982‚Äì1983, during the summer of 1982‚Äì1983 he played and recorded with Beachouse. Also in the Curse's line-up were Adrian Chynoweth on guitar, Nique Needles, John Rowell and Graeme Scott. He moved to Reptile Smile with Chynoweth and Nick Cross, Rick Hawkins and Tony Hawkins during 1983‚Äì1984. Then Freak Power with Chynoweth, Needles and Scott before joining, the Wreckery, a rock and blues group in December 1985. The Wreckery had formed earlier in 1985 with Robin Casinader on drums, piano, Hammond organ, guitar and violin (ex- Plays with Marionettes, Horla), Edward Clayton-Jones on guitar, organ and vocals (ex-Fabulous Marquises, Plays with Marionettes, Horla, Nick Cave and the Bad Seeds), Tadeusz O'Biegly on bass guitar, Hugo Race on vocals and guitar (ex-Plays with Marionettes, Nick Cave and the Bad Seeds) and Charles Todd on saxophone, organ (ex-Wild Dog Rodeo, Cattletruck). Barker performed on their releases, Yeh My People (mini-album, 1986), Here at Pain's Insistence (1987), The Collection (compilation, 1988), and Laying Down Law (1988) but he had left early in 1988, before the latter appeared. Barker moved to lead guitar and lead vocals when he formed, Nick Barker & the Reptiles, a rock, blues and power pop band in March 1988 with former bandmate Chynoweth on guitar; and Drew Basford on bass guitar and David Pinder on drums. They signed to Mushroom Records' White Label imprint. Their debut single, \\"Another Me\\", appeared in December. Chris Harris joined the group on harmonica. Also during 1988 and 1989 Barker was a member of Hugo Race and the True Spirit and Mark Seymour and the Daydreamers on bass guitar. Nick Barker & the Reptiles released their debut album, Goin' to Pieces, in August 1989, which peaked into the Australian Recording Industry Association (ARIA) Albums Chart at No. 35. It was co-produced by Jim Faraci (Femme Fatale), Mark Moffatt (Mental As Anything, Midnight Oil) and Chris Bailey (ex-The Saints). Penelope Layland of The Canberra Times observed, \\"Patchy production mars this debut album from [the group]. Their music really relies on its rough and rude edge, and without it, loses much of its appeal... [it] is hardly a dismal failure, [they] just haven't quite come up with the goods. You can only make so many excuses for a debut album. After that it comes down to the fact that a patchy album costs just as much as a great one.\\" The band's cover version of Cockney Rebel's \\"Make Me Smile (Come Up and See Me)\\" reached the top 30 on the ARIA Singles Chart in November. They undertook a touring schedule with 200 performances a year on the national pub rock circuit. Australian musicologist, Ian McFarlane, described how \\"[their] sassy brand of commercial rock'n'blues found immediate acceptance... [by] becoming one of the archetypal Oz Rock pub bands of the era.\\" In 1990 Matthew Heydon joined on keyboards and Marc Scully (ex-Love Rodeo, Deadly Hume) replaced Basford on bass guitar. Their second album, After the Show (March 1991), was produced by Los Angeles-based, Joe Hardy (Steve Earl, Tom Cochrane), which peaked at No. 33.

[their] sound has not been forcefully smoothed out beyond recognition in the recording studio. Their enthusiastic live sound has been allowed to seep through.\\" None of After the Shows three singles charted into the top 50. \\"Out in the Open\\" appeared in February 1992 and was followed by an extended play, Loose, in April. Its tracks were used as fill music on the TV program, Nine's Wide World of Sports. After a hiatus and overseas travel, Barker returned to Melbourne and disbanded the Reptiles in 1993. He formed Barker with ex-Reptile Heydon, and Venom Brown on drums (ex- Massive Appendage), Tim Henwood on guitar and Anthony Ragg on bass guitar (ex- Kings of the Sun). They released three singles and an album, Happy Man, in 1994 and followed with Son of Happy Man (EP) in 1995. Of their singles, \\"Time Bomb\\", was voted No. 20 on Triple J Hottest 100 list for 1994. Barker's solo career started with the album, Damn Mermaids (1996), and two singles, his backing band were Lincoln Jones on bass guitar and Craig Whitelock on drums. His second solo album, Annie Get Your Guru appeared in 1999. Barker continued to perform solo and acoustic ‚Äî or accompanied by a keyboardist or harmonica player ‚Äî into the 2000s. His 2001 release, Returned Service, had acoustic tracks culled from live performances in Adelaide and Melbourne. Australian music journalist, Ed Nimmervoll, observed, \\"[he] can stand in front of an audience with his acoustic guitar and simply perform song after song, songs from his past or recent songs. No need for all the industry trappings... Songs about real life, things he's done, seen and thought, stripped back versions of songs you'll be familiar with ('Miles to Go', 'Time Bomb', 'Imogen'), and rarer songs.\\" He had signed to Croxton Records, an imprint co-founded by former Weddings Parties Anything front man, Mick Thomas. Barker became popular in Brazil and released, Sanctuary ‚Äì Best of, there in 2002. In 2003, he released Backyard Six which featured a musical response to the Bali bombings, \\"Plait Your Hair\\". In 2005 Barker re-did his earlier songs as part of the Liberation Blue Acoustic Series on C-sides. Since 1997 Barker has branched into acting roles including minor appearances in TV series, Blue Heelers and Pizza, and appearing in a role in Amy, a feature film, alongside Rachel Griffiths, which was produced by David Parker and Nadia Tass. He also penned and performed songs for its soundtrack, which included work by Ed Kuepper, Lamb and Philip Judd, (ex-Split Enz). In addition to his own recording and touring commitments, Barker has produced young Adelaide rock act, Southpaw. Barker has written tracks, recorded and performed with Mark Seymour (Hunters & Collectors), Paul Kelly, and You Am I front man, Tim Rogers. Matt Heydon of the Reptiles went on to Jimmy Barnes' band, Marc Scully later joined Ratcat, and Tim Henwood of Barker later joined the Superjesus and the Androids. Barker toured with Rogers, including to United Kingdom and Europe; he toured in Jimmy Barnes' band for the New Zealand leg of the in the Heat of Night tour, during 2006‚Äì07. In November and December 2010 and the following February, Barker performed in a musical theatre show, The Ultimate Rock 'n' Roll Jam Session, with James Blundell, Dave Larkin, Ezra Lee and Doug Parkinson. In March 2011 Barker played at the Whorouly Hotel Beer Garden to mark the first of its type in the revitalised pub. Barker's band comprised Michael Barclay on drums, Alan Brooker (ex-Paul Kelly and the Dots) on bass guitar and Justin Garner on lead guitar. It was organised by Troy Wood and publicans, Graham Wood and Jennifer Garrett. According to Geelong-based music critic, Rokdog (Chris Nicholls) it was an early contender for 2011 gig of the year. During July of that year he took the lead role of Bon Scott in a musical, Hell Ain't a Bad Place to Be ‚Äì The Story of Bon Scott, premiering at Melbourne's Athenaeum Theatre. Barker fronted the Heartache State, a group formed with Garner and Brown in 2014. They released a self-titled album in March 2015. In September 2017 they issued their second album, Last of the Buffalo. Barker observed, \\"It really feels like a band now, loose but with a lot of spirit.

This expression originated from the characteristic headgear worn by the stereotypical representatives of this circle. The term ‚Äúmohair berets‚Äù alludes to the colloquial name \\"Green berets\\" for military units such as special forces (in Polish, \\"red and green berets\\").  History  The expression ‚Äúmohair berets‚Äù was used for the first time in 2004 and it referred to the people who were regularly attending masses in Gda≈Ñsk celebrated by Henryk Jankowski, the parish priest. When he was dismissed from his post, the same parishioners staged demonstrations in his defence. A beret made of mohair or its imitation, and often a handmade one, is commonly associated with its typical wearers, mostly poor elderly ladies. That is the exact social environment of many of Jankowski‚Äôs followers who were shown on television. Probably the first article which introduced the expression ‚Äúmohair berets‚Äù to the Polish press was the one published in the daily Rzeczpospolita from 23 October 2004 titled ‚ÄúLabyrinths of the parish priest‚Äù. It reads as follows: ‚ÄúOld ladies have their eyes fixed on Father Jankowski and they hang on his every word. Rumour has it that the prelate has his own legion of mohair berets in Gda≈Ñsk.‚Äù The expression has spread over the journalism and discussions on Internet forums and started to be used when referring to broader social groups, mostly active listeners of the Catholic radio station Radio Maryja. The term ‚Äúmohair berets‚Äù became commonly used after Robert G√≥recki, a photojournalist of Gazeta Wyborcza, published the photograph on the Internet which depicted the 14th anniversary of Radio Maryja in December 2005. The picture showed numerous listeners of the radio with berets on their heads. Then the term entered the language of politics and became partly associated with the supporters of those parties which were given plenty of broadcast time on Radio Maryja during the election campaign in 2005, especially the electorate of the League of Polish Families (LPR) and Law and Justice (PiS).  The mohair coalition  A typical mohair beret The phrase ‚Äúmohair berets‚Äù gained a widespread popularity in colloquial language, particularly in some political skirmishes. The example of such a reference is the term ‚Äúmohair coalition‚Äù used by Donald Tusk during the debate in Sejm on the inaugural address of a newly designated Prime Minister Kazimierz Marcinkiewicz on 10 November 2005. ‚ÄúPoland deserves more than what is currently known as a mohair coalition,‚Äù said Donald Tusk. The PO leader used such an expression to describe an unofficial parliamentary coalition of PiS, the LPR and Self-Defence. He also suggested that the coalition existed even though PiS persisted in denying it. Donald Tusk officially apologised to the indignant pensioner Julita Kon for his statement when confronted with her in Olsztyn on 30 November 2005, the day when he was on his way to meet with the members of the housing cooperative Domator in Olsztyn who kept demanding to call the general meeting of the cooperative for almost two weeks. The coalition described by Tusk was observed in many votes in Sejm and it was officially sealed later by so-called ‚Äústabilisation pact‚Äù(an agreement between PiS, the LPR and Self-Defence on their cooperation in the parliament ) followed by forming a coalition by those parties. The term has not appeared in Polish media since 2005.  Parodies  The mohair berets are a leitmotiv of the satirical song Mohair berets recorded by Big Cyc which was released in April 2006 on the album of the same title. The photographs promoting the album showed the band members wearing mohair berets. As soon as in May of the same year Kabaret OT.TO presented the parody of the hip hop song titled Mohair neighbours. The phenomenon of mohair berets is also a key theme of skits (called Mohair programme) performed by cabaret Neo-N√≥wka from Wroc≈Çaw as well as the song Moherowy ninja (Mohair ninja) from the album Gra? recorded by the alternative rock band L-D√≥pa.  Statistics  The social group called ‚Äúmohair berets‚Äù came under close scrutiny conducted by one of the companies dealing with personal data processing. Its analyses showed that mohair berets accounts for 3.1 per cent of the overall Polish population, the typical representatives of the group analysed being mostly married couple over 50 years old, whose children have already left the nest. As much as 80 per cent of them have only elementary or elementary plus vocational education, 36 per cent of the group are blue collar workers. According to the analyses those people avoid modern technologies (over 50 per cent have not opened a bank account and only one out of four people use mobile phones). The analysis proves that due to the low incomes the group members have to make sure that their bills do not exceed 100 PLN per month so they do their shopping in small shops or cheap discount shops. They usually spend their free time on an allotment (gardening plots are widespread in Poland for dwellers of high-rise flats), solve crosswords and puzzles or go fishing. A minority of those surveyed never go on holidays, 73 per cent spend their time off at home.

Based on Michael Crichton's 1969 novel of the same name and adapted by Nelson Gidding, the film stars Arthur Hill, James Olson, Kate Reid, and David Wayne as a team of scientists who investigate a deadly organism of extraterrestrial origin. With a few exceptions, the film follows the book closely. The special effects were designed by Douglas Trumbull. The film is notable for its use of split screen in certain scenes.  Plot  The story is told in flashback by Dr. Jeremy Stone, who is testifying to a congressional committee. After a U.S. government satellite crashes near the small rural town of Piedmont, New Mexico, almost all of the town's residents die. A military recovery team tries to recover the satellite, but is unsuccessful. Suspecting that the satellite has brought back an alien organism, the military activates an elite scientific team. Wearing protective suits, Dr. Stone, the team leader, and Dr. Mark Hall, a surgeon, are dropped in Piedmont by helicopter. They find that the town's doctor had opened the satellite in his office and that all of his blood has crystallized into a powder. They soon discover that almost all of the victims' blood has crystallized, causing rapid death. Two other townspeople have committed suicide after going insane. Stone and Hall retrieve the satellite and find two survivors ‚Äî a 69-year-old alcoholic man named Peter Jackson and a six-month- old infant. In addition to Stone and Hall, the elite team also includes Dr. Charles Dutton and Dr. Ruth Leavitt, who are summoned to a top-secret underground facility with the code name Wildfire, located in Nevada. Upon arrival they undergo extreme decontamination procedures, descending through four disinfection levels to a fifth level, where laboratories are located. If the organism threatens to escape, the Wildfire facility includes an automatic nuclear self-destruct mechanism to incinerate all infectious agents. Under the \\"odd man hypothesis\\", Dr. Hall is entrusted with the only key that can deactivate the device, the theory being that an unmarried male is the most dispassionate person within a group to make critical decisions in a crisis situation. By examining the satellite with powerful cameras, the team discovers the microscopic alien organism responsible for the deaths in New Mexico. The greenish, throbbing life form is assigned the code name \\"Andromeda\\". Andromeda kills animal life almost instantly and appears to be highly virulent. The team studies the organism using animal subjects, an electron microscope, and culturing in various growth media in an attempt to learn how it works. Hall tries to determine why the elderly man and the baby survived. A military jet crashes near Piedmont after the pilot radios that his plastic oxygen mask is dissolving. Meanwhile, Dr. Stone, who created the Wildfire laboratory, is accused by Dutton and Leavitt of designing the lab for biological warfare research. Unknown to other team members, Leavitt's research on the germ is impaired by her undisclosed epilepsy. Hall realizes that the alcoholic Jackson survived because his blood was acidic from drinking Sterno, and that the baby lived due to his blood being too alkaline from constant crying, suggesting that the organism, Andromeda, can survive only within a narrow range of blood pH. Just as he has this insight, the organism mutates into a non-lethal form that degrades synthetic rubber and plastics. Andromeda escapes the containment room into the lab where Dutton is working. Once all the laboratory's seals start decaying due to Andromeda's escape, a five-minute countdown to nuclear destruction is initiated. Hall rescues Leavitt from an epileptic seizure, triggered by the flashing red lights of Wildfire's alarm system. Meanwhile, the team realizes that the alien microbe would thrive on the energy of a nuclear explosion and would consequently be transformed into a supercolony that could destroy all life on Earth. Hall races against the laboratory's automated defenses to reach a station where he can disable the nuclear bomb with his key. He endures an attack by automated lasers as he climbs through the laboratory's central core until he finds a working station, disables the bomb, and then collapses. Hall awakens in a hospital bed. His colleagues reveal that clouds are being seeded over the Pacific Ocean, which will cause rain to sweep Andromeda from the atmosphere and into alkaline seawater, rendering it harmless. The movie ends with Stone testifying to a U.S. senator that, while they were able to defeat the alien pathogen, they may be unable to do so in the future. The film ends by showing Andromeda dissolving in seawater and then forming the number 601, the Wildfire computer signal for information coming in too fast for the computer to analyze.

Background  Film rights were bought by Universal for $250,000. The cast of characters in the novel was modified for the film, including by replacing the male Dr. Peter Leavitt in the novel with the female Dr. Ruth Leavitt. Screenwriter Nelson Gidding suggested the change to Wise, who at first was not enthusiastic, as he initially pictured the female Dr. Leavitt as a largely decorative character reminiscent of Raquel Welch's character in the 1966 film Fantastic Voyage. When Gidding explained his take on Leavitt, Wise resolved the question by asking the opinion of a number of scientists, who were unanimously enthusiastic about the idea. Eventually Wise came to be very happy with the decision to make Leavitt female, feeling that Kate Reid's Dr. Leavitt was \\"the most interesting character\\" in the film.The Making of The Andromeda Strain, DVD documentary. Another minor change was the character of Burton in the novel, who became Charles Dutton in the film; no reason was given for this name change. The Andromeda Strain was one of the first films to use advanced computerized photographic visual effects, with work by Douglas Trumbull, who had pioneered effects for 2001: A Space Odyssey, along with James Shourt and Albert Whitlock who worked on The Birds. Reportedly $250,000 of the film's budget of $6.5 million was used to create the special effects, including Trumbull's simulation of an electron microscope.DOUGLAS TRUMBULL, VES: Advancing New Technologies for the Future of Film VFXVoice.com.

Flanked by the Western Ghats on the east and the Vembanad Lake and paddy fields of Kuttanad on the west, Kottayam is a place that is known for extraordinary qualities. It is the district headquarters of Kottayam district, located in south-west Kerala. Kottayam is located in the basin of the Meenachil River at an average elevation of above sea level, and has a moderate climate. It is located 150 kilometres (93 mi) north of the state capital Thiruvananthapuram. The city is known for its trade in natural rubber, and the national Rubber Board is headquartered in the city, as is the Plantation Corporation of Kerala. Kottayam Port is India's first multi-modal inland container depot. The headquarters of the Malankara Orthodox Syrian Church, called the Catholicate Aramana (Catholicate palace), is situated at nearby Devalokam. Many of the first Malayalam daily newspapers, like Deepika, Malayala Manorama, and Mangalam, were started and are headquartered in Kottayam, as are a number of publishing houses. Etymology The royal house of the Thekkumkur ruler was protected by a fort called Thaliyilkotta. It is believed that the name Kottayam is derived from a combination of the Malayalam words kotta which means \\"fort\\" (Thalitilkotta) and akam which means \\"inside\\". The combined form, Kottaykkakam (‡¥ï‡µã‡¥ü‡µç‡¥ü‡¥Ø‡µç‡¥ï‡µç‡¥ï‡¥ï‡¥Ç), can be translated as \\"inside the fort\\". History = Thekkumkur rule (1100‚Äì1753 AD) = From the beginning of the ninth century AD, the history of Thekkumkur and of Kottayam are virtually indistinguishable. Kottayam was then a part of Vempolinad, an area in the Kulashekara Empire (800‚Äì1102 AD). By about 1100, the Kingdom of Vempolinad had split into the Kingdoms of Thekkumkur and Vadakkumkur, and the latter became a vassal of Cochin. The royal house had originally beeb situated in Vennimala in Kottayam. It was protected by a fort known as Thaliyilkotta and, as a result, the locality came to be known by the same name as the fort. Afterwards, Thekkumkur kings shifted their capital to Nattassery near Kumaranallore at the outskirts of Kottayam town. It is believed that the Thekkumkur dynasty ruled Kottayam from Thazhathangadi. Rulers of Munjanad and Thekkumkur had their headquarters at Thazhathangadi in the present Kottayam town. Marthanda Varma of Travancore attacked Thekkumkur and destroyed the palace and the Thaliyil fort. The remnants of the palaces and forts are still seen here. The Portuguese and the Dutch established trade relations with both of these kingdoms, dealing in black pepper and other spices. After the subjugation of the Dutch East India Company by the Kingdom of Travancore in 1742, military operations of Marthanda Varma progressed against the northern neighbouring kingdoms, including Thekkumkur. Though Thekkumkur allied with Chempakassery and Vadakkumkoor to protect the kingdom, all of them were finally annexed to Travancore. Another source states that the ruler of Thekkumkur had sided first with the Kingdom of Kayamkulam and then with the principality of Ambalapuzha against Travancore. After the fall of Ambalapuzha, and as the ruler of Thekkumkur refused to come to terms with Travancore, his capital city was taken on 11 September 1750 by Ramayyan Dalawa, the general and prime minister of Marthanda Varma, and the state was annexed to Travancore in 1753. During British rule in India, Kottayam remained a part of the Princely State of Travancore. =British rule= There existed no institution in the princely state of Travancore before the 1800s. In 1817, the Church Missionary Society of England established CMS College as the first college in India. It was welcomed by the government to provide administrators for the public bureaucracy left Kottayam has played its role in all the political agitations of modern times. The ‚ÄòMalayali Memorial ‚Äò agitation may be said to have had its origin in Kottayam. The Malayali Memorial sought to secure better representation for educated Travancoreans in the Travancore civil service against persons from outside.

The event marked the beginning of the modern political movement in the State.

In 1932, it merged into what is now the Moore College of Art and Design. History Sarah Worthington King Peter, wife of the British consul in Philadelphia, established an industrial arts school in her home in 1848 to teach women without a means of supporting themselves a trade. The school taught lithography, wood carving, and design, such as for household items like carpets and wallpaper. Peter's husband died soon after she established the school and she returned to her Cincinnati, Ohio home. In 1850, Peter wrote to the Franklin Institute about her drawing class of some 20 young women becoming a \\"co-operative, but separate branch\\" of the Institute. The Franklin Institute established and supervised the Philadelphia School of Design for Women from 1850 to 1853. A group of 17 men were designated the incorporators of the school in 1853. Elliott Cresson was among these 17 directors, and was elected president at the first meeting. Scientific illustrator Helen Elizabeth Lawson was appointed to the position of secretary of the school. It was the country's largest art school for women and its students included Emily Sartain, Jessie Willcox Smith, Alice Barber Stephens, Elizabeth Shippen Green, Annie Traquair Lang and Alice Neel.Hoffmann, Mott, Sharon, Amanda (2008). Moore College of Art & Design. Arcadia Publishing. . Elizabeth Croasdale was the school's principal before Emily Sartain took the position in 1886. Sartain was the school's leader until 1920. She implemented life-drawing classes at the Philadelphia School of Design for Women, using draped male and nude women models, which was revolutionary at the time for women artists. Sartain created a professional program that was built upon technical and lengthy training and high standards. The women were taught to create works of art based upon three- dimensional and human forms, based upon her training in Paris and at the Pennsylvania Academy of the Fine Arts. She was responsible for introducing important faculty members such as Robert Henri, Samuel Murray and Daniel Garber. In 1892, Robert Henri began teaching at the school. William Innes Homer said, \\"A born teacher, Henri enjoyed immediate success at the school.\\" Nina de Angeli Walls wrote, In 1932 it merged into the Moore Institute of Art, Science, and Industry. It is now the Moore College of Art and Design, which offers both a Bachelor of Fine Arts degree and a Master of Arts in Art Education.

The Woodrow Wilson Lodge members originally met and dined in Madison Hall, which is now part of John D. Rockefeller III College. Inspired by the ideas of Woodrow Wilson, president of Princeton from 1902‚Äì1910, the members advocated a more thorough integration of academic, social and residential life on campus. History In the fall of 1961, President Robert Goheen dedicated Wilcox Hall, the bequest of a distinguished alumnus, T. Ferdinand Wilcox '00, and the Lodge moved to the new dining facility and became the Woodrow Wilson Society. Wilcox Hall provided a permanent facility for the Woodrow Wilson Society with a dining room, library, billiards area, lounges for reading and recreation, and rooms for various social activities. The completed dormitory quadrangle consisted of Dodge- Osborn Hall, 1937 Hall, 1938 Hall, 1939 Hall and Christian Gauss Hall, honoring the late Dean of the college. Today, the college also includes Feinberg Hall, which was completed in 1988, Walker Hall, and 1927-Clapp Hall. In 1966, the Woodrow Wilson Society was formally reorganized as Woodrow Wilson College with Julian Jaynes of the Psychology Department as its first Master. He was succeeded by John Fleming of the English Department, Master from 1969‚Äì1972; Henry Drewry of History, Master from 1972‚Äì1975; Norman Itzkowitz of Near Eastern Studies, Master from 1975‚Äì1989; and then again by Fleming, who returned as Master of Wilson College for 1989‚Äì1997. Miguel A. Centeno of the Department of Sociology was Master from 1997 through the spring of 2004, and Professor Marguerite Browning of the Program in Linguistics began her term as Master in the Fall of 2004. Beginning in 2007, then-Woodrow Wilson College became a four-year residential college, with new programs and advising. However, it later reverted to becoming a two-year residential college, only housing freshmen and sophomores, a state in which it remains today. On June 26, 2020, Princeton University Board of Trustees announced that Woodrow Wilson's name will be removed from the Woodrow Wilson College and the Woodrow Wilson School of Public and International Affairs, citing that his \\"racist thinking and policies make him an inappropriate namesake for a school whose scholars, students, and alumni must be firmly committed to combatting the scourge of racism in all its forms.\\" Woodrow Wilson College is to be renamed First College until its scheduled retirement in 2022, when it will be replaced by one of two new residential colleges. Student life The college is home to roughly 500 freshmen and sophomores and a small number of upperclass Residential College Advisors (RCAs). The college staff is led by the master (a faculty member), and also includes a dean, a director of studies, a director of student life, a college administrator, a college assistant, and a college secretary. A council of current students also contributes to college life, organizing trips, study breaks, and other opportunities. The college at present houses no upperclassmen, with the exception of RCAs. A small number of graduate students also live in Wilson as advisers to undergraduate residents. First is a two-year college, paired with nearby Butler College. First College students who wish to live in a residential college past their sophomore year may move into one of the three four-year colleges, Whitman, Mathey, and Butler. Since First is paired with Butler College, priority for housing in Butler is given to students who spent their first two years living in First or Butler. Therefore, although it is possible for a First resident to move into any of the three four-year colleges after sophomore year, it is most advantageous for him or her to move into Butler.

He remarried and opened a surf shop in Indialantic, Florida. Burglary Murphy was involved in the notorious burglary, on October 29, 1964, at New York's American Museum of Natural History, of 24 precious gems, including the Star of India, the Eagle Diamond and the DeLong Star Ruby.David Sears, \\"How Three Amateur Jewel Thieves Made Off With New York‚Äôs Most Precious Gems,\\" Smithsonian, February 25, 2014. This heist was called the \\"Jewel Heist of the Century.\\" It targeted the museum's J.P. Morgan jewel collection. Murphy had cased the museum earlier and discovered that security was lax to non-existent. The burglar alarm system was non-operational, and the hall's 19 exterior windows were left open two inches overnight for ventilation. The thieves climbed in through the window and discovered that the display case alarms were non-functional as well. The stolen jewels were reported as being worth more than $400,000, though museum officials indicated the loss was actually incalculable. Murphy and both his accomplices, Alan Kuhn and Roger Clark, were arrested two days later after being tipped off by staff members at the Cambridge House hotel where the three men had been staying and throwing lavish parties. The men were arrested and charged with first degree burglary and possession of burglary tools. Free on bail, the men returned to Florida. Months later, prosecutors charged Murphy and Kuhn with the unrelated robbery and assault of actress Eva Gabor. In response to the new charges, a judge raised their bail to $150,000 and the men were jailed. Kuhn offered to retrieve the jewels in exchange for a lighter sentence. The uninsured Star of India was recovered in a foot locker at a Miami bus station. Most of the other gems were also recovered, except the Eagle Diamond, which has since been hypothesized to have been cut down into smaller stones. Richard Duncan Pearson was also convicted. In April 1965, Murphy, Kuhn and Clark pleaded guilty to burglary and grand larceny and were sentenced to three years. Writer Nora Ephron, then only 23, covered the story for the New York Post. The heist was the subject of the film Murph the Surf (1975), directed by Marvin Chomsky, and starring Robert Conrad, Burt Young, and Don Stroud (as Murphy). Whiskey Creek Murders and other crimes In 1967, in Broward County, Florida, the weighted-down bodies of Terry Rae Frank and Annelle Marie Mohn were found in Whiskey Creek Canal, near Hollywood, at the site of John U. Lloyd Beach State Park. The two women were former employees of the Los Angeles brokerage firm Rutner, Jackson & Gray. They were suspects in the theft of $488,732 worth of stocks (equivalent to approximately $ in dollars). The loss of the stocks was not discovered until after the two women quit the firm and moved to Florida. Shortly after arriving in Florida, Frank and Mohn moved in with Murphy. In 1968, Murphy was the getaway driver in the robbery of socialite Olive Wofford.\\"Florida won't restore rights of famed jewel thief,\\" Associated Press, December 14, 2012. In 1969, Murphy and an accomplice, Jack Griffith, were tried in Fort Lauderdale for the murder of twenty-four year old Terry Rae Frank, one of two women whose bodies were found in the Whiskey Creek Canal. Murphy's attorney pleaded not guilty of first- degree murder by reason of insanity. Murphy was committed to a mental hospital for several months before the judge ruled that he was fit to stand trial. In March 1969, he was sentenced to life in prison with hard labor. Griffith was convicted of second-degree murder, and received a 45-year sentence with hard labor., Murphy subsequently was convicted in the Wofford robbery. He was sentenced to a second life sentence plus 20 years. Parole Bill Glass, Roger Staubach, and McCoy McLemore, world champion athletes and local businessmen, visited the Florida State prison in 1974. Murphy was impressed by these visitors and decided to change his life. At that time, Murphy's earliest parole date was November 2005. Murphy began participating in the prison chaplaincy program, leading Bible studies, and mentoring other men in prison. His parole date was moved up progressively because of good behavior. The Florida Parole Board voted to release Murphy, effective November 1986. Some conditions of his parole included making a $2500 donation to Meals on Wheels, and a restriction on returning to Dade and Broward counties, where the crimes were committed. Life after prison In 1986, Murphy began visiting prisons and jails all over the U.S. as a part of his prison ministry. He was hired by Bill Glass Champions for Life in 1986. Murphy was also a featured speaker for Kairos Prison Ministry, Coalition of Prison Evangelists, International Network of Prison Ministries, Time for Freedom, and Good News Jail & Prison Ministry. After visiting over 1,200 prisons, and recognizing the change apparent in Murphy's life, the Florida Parole Board terminated his \\"lifetime parole\\" in 2000. Murphy was the keynote speaker in Jerusalem during the 1st World Conference on Crime Prevention and Rehabilitation through Religion. He was a frequent guest on Christian television and radio programs. Murphy also appeared on CNN's Larry King Live. As of August 2011, Murphy had been serving as a Vice-President of International Network of Prison Ministries, visiting prisons, jails, and youth detention facilities all over the world. Murphy wrote a book about his experience and testimony entitled Jewels for the Journey. He carried campaign signs for Bernie Decastro for sheriff in 2012. Jack Roland Murphy lived in Crystal River, Florida, with his wife, Kitten, and grandchildren. In 2012, Murphy's bid for clemency was denied by the state of Florida. Former Florida Department of Corrections Secretary Louie L. Wainwright spoke on Murphy's behalf about the prison ministry work he had done since his 1986 release from prison. According to reports, Governor Rick Scott was personally willing to restore Murphy's rights, but did not have the additional two votes from cabinet members required under Florida law. Murphy has been featured in the following films: *Murph the Surf (1975) *Great Crimes and Trials of the Twentieth Century - Murf the Surf: The Boston Brink's Robbery (1992) *Do's and Don'ts of Prison Ministry (2008) In a 2019 New York Times feature story on the 1964 jewel heist, Murphy, the only survivor among the robbers, was quoted at length from his home in Florida. Murphy died on September 12, 2020 in Crystal River Florida. According to his wife he died of heart and organ failure.

Episodes air at 3 p.m. ET on Monday through Friday. The show focuses on the day's events with interviews, current event updates, and comprehensive reporting. The show is a part of the Fox News program lineup since January 20, 2020, and has been the number one cable news broadcast in its time slot.  Synopsis  The program continues coverage of stories followed during prior hours of Fox News programs. The show often takes a swifter pace compared to the network's other programming, making a larger focus of the program on breaking-news events with live correspondents. The coverage includes correspondents on location, in studio, in addition to analysis from pundits or experts. Trace Gallagher fills in on days when Smith is absent. Prior to the program's relaunch on April 23, 2007, and to a larger extent summer 2007, Studio B was commonly seen as more laid-back, including a short segment of small talk after the bottom-of-the-hour headlines between Smith and Jane Skinner commonly about soft news or irrelevant stories of the day. The segment was known as \\"Skinnerville\\".  History  The program's relaunch included the conclusion of the weekend edition of Studio B, hosted by Trace Gallagher, which was started in February 2006. Studio B replaced the 3-4 p.m. ET hour of Fox News Live (also hosted by Smith) in 2002, and the weekend hour of Fox News Live in 2005. The weekend editions were discontinued in May 2007, when the 3-4 p.m. timeslot was replaced by reruns of War Stories with Oliver North, or other taped programming. Trace Gallagher hosted Studio B as a fill-in anchor whenever Smith was absent. Also in 2007, Smith revealed that the program would soon get a more expansive overhaul, which may include name and format changes. This is partly because FNC's physical Studio B is no longer available for the network's use. On December 14, 2008, Studio B moved to Studio 12H, the set used by the Fox Report due to its move to the high definition Election Night set used by Fox. On January 9, 2009, Studio B moved to a new set in Studio 12H. Despite the actual studio name, Shepard Smith stated that this studio will be the new Studio B, \\"because that is the name of the program\\". While Studio B moved to the aforementioned HD set, it continued to broadcast in 4:3 with the Fox News HD wing at the side, until March 23, 2009, when the show began broadcasting in full 16:9. During the week of September 26 ‚Äì October 2, 2011, the Fox Report moved into its former studios, Studio E, which was used from September 2007 to December 2008 at the same time, Studio B moved into the newsroom and Shepard Smith announced on the September 28 broadcast that the Fox Report and Studio B moved into a new set on October 10, 2011. On that date, Studio B and the Fox Report introduced a new look and graphics featuring the new lower-thirds graphics for the show as seen on other Fox News Channel shows, The Five and Happening Now. Shepard Smith presented the show from a modified Studio 12H featuring more monitors and retaining \\"The Cube\\" but the overhead platform and accompanying staircase, which had been part of the set since 2008 had been removed. On October 7, 2013, Studio B was relaunched as Shepard Smith Reporting with new graphics and a new state of the art studio called \\"The Fox News Deck\\" in Studio D. The program was temporarily rebranded Fox News Reporting on October 14, 2019, upon Shepard Smith's departure from Fox News. On January 20, 2020, Bill Hemmer, who was previously co-anchor of America's Newsroom, took over as the new anchor of this program, which accordingly changed its current title to Bill Hemmer Reports.  Controversy  On September 28, 2012, Studio B inadvertently broadcast the suicide (due to a gunshot to the head) of 33-year-old Jodon F. Romero, who carjacked a vehicle in Phoenix, resulting in an police pursuit that ended near Salome, Arizona. Shepard Smith implored his technical staff to cut off the helicopter feed from Fox-owned station KSAZ-TV after the suicide made it to air during live coverage. Following an abrupt commercial break, Smith issued an on-air apology for a broadcast delay failure made by the channel's master control operators. In a statement, Fox News Channel executive vice president of news editorial Michael Clemente, acknowledged the error in broadcasting the suspect's suicide: ‚ÄúWe took every precaution to avoid any such live incident by putting the helicopter pictures on a five second delay. Unfortunately, this mistake was the result of a severe human error and we apologize for what viewers ultimately saw on the screen.‚Äù Fox News was sued for unspecified damages by Romero's wife due to this incident. She claimed that her children had seen the video of Romero‚Äôs suicide and subsequently became traumatized. In February 2014, the lawsuit was dismissed by Judge John Rea who ruled the coverage was protected by the First Amendment and the plaintiffs were unable to \\"satisfy the essential elements of claiming intentional infliction of emotional distress\\". In August 2015, the verdict was upheld in an Arizona appeals court.  Location  Shepard Smith Reporting was broadcast from Studio D (The Fox News Deck) at 1211 Avenue of the Americas (also known as the News Corp. Building), New York City.

History The origins of Mount Union College's radio station can be traced to four Mount Union students who hatched the idea one afternoon in the Spring of 1965. The four were Andy Bass, Jim Lang, Daun Yeagley, and Dee Grapentine. A concept of operations was developed, presentations were given to the school President, Dr. Carl C. Bracy (who whole-heartedly gave his blessings) and to the Student Senate who allocated $2,000 as seed money for a station. Dr. James Rodman and Dr. Joseph Falk were appointed as faculty advisors. The FCC was contacted to see if there were any low power AM broadcast frequencies available for the school to use. The answer was no. Because of a limited budget FM broadcasting was not explored. Another possibility, not requiring FCC approval, was to superimpose a low power AM radio signal on the AC power lines running in the dormitories. By using any AM radio plugged into a dorm power outlet students could receive the signal. WKSU at Kent State University was known to have used this type of system at one time on their campus. Personnel at WKSU were contacted and most helpful including providing schematics and drawings for the design of the carrier current transmitters they had used. Parts for the transmitters were purchased and Dee Grapentine (a licensed amateur radio operator) built the first operational unit. School electrician Jim Hayes wired it into the King Hall dormitory power system and it worked like a charm. Subsequently more transmitters were built by Jim Corner and Ken Simpson, both amateur radio operators. Many other students and faculty pitched in to make WRMU a reality. The school had a broadcast studio built to professional standards and bore the cost of installing telephone lines to each of the dormitories so the broadcast signal could be fed there. Station management was established with Jim Lang named as Program Manager, Daun Yeagley as Chief Engineer, with Andy Bass as Assistant Engineer, and Dee Grapentine as Station Manager. The first official broadcast of WRMU was done on the evening of 10 January 1966. Dr. Bracy gave the opening remarks. The students who organized the station wanted to use the call letters WMUC‚Äîfor Mt. Union College, but the call letters were already taken. So WRMU‚ÄîRadio Mt. Union, was chosen as it was available. The original station contained one studio in the basement of Miller Hall. The construction of that studio started in the Fall of 1965. WRMU continued as a campus-only station until October 17, 1970 when the Federal Communications Commission (FCC) granted the College a license for WRMU to become a full-fledged FM station with the frequency 91.1. During the 1970s the station featured a mix of jazz, blues, classical and rock music. The station also began to broadcast Mount Union football and basketball games. From the basement of Miller Hall, the radio station moved to new quarters on the second floor of Memorial Hall in 1983. The station grew from two studios to a total of four. A year later in 1984, the station began broadcasting in stereo. In May 1996, the station moved into its new and current home in the Hoover-Price Campus Center, where visitors can watch air talent through windows in the on-air studio. Throughout the station's history Mount Union students have worked to provide the community and campus with the best programming possible. WRMU currently features jazz during the week and \\"oldies\\" during the weekend. R91 In January 2010, student-run radio shows broadcasting from 10pm to 2am on weekdays switched to the collective moniker of \\"R91\\", short for \\"Raider 91.\\" The student shows feature a wide variety of music from rock to hip-hop, pop and alternative. R91 is meant to appeal to the Mount Union student body, in contrast to the daytime variety hits format that reaches out to the local Alliance/Canton, Ohio area.

During the Middle Ages, Borama was ruled by the Adal Sultanate. It later formed a part of the British Somaliland protectorate in the first half of the 20th century. According to the UNDP in 2005 the city had a population of around 215,616, making it one of the largest cities inside Somalia. It has been a leading example in community organizing, having been the first area in Somaliland to adopt a self-help scheme in the wake of the civil war.Borama Local Council, p.10. History Qorgab Valley outside Borama As with several nearby towns such as Amud, numerous archaeological finds have been discovered in the Borama area that point to an eventful past. The latter include ancient remains of tombs, houses and mosques, in addition to sherds of Oriental wares, particularly Chinese porcelain. The artefacts and structures date from various historical periods, ranging from the 12th through to the 18th centuries. Most, however, are from the 15th and 16th centuries, a time of great commercial activity in the region that is associated with the medieval Adal Sultanate.Bernard Samuel Myers, ed., Encyclopedia of World Art, Volume 13, (McGraw-Hill: 1959), p.xcii. Excavations in the late 1800s and early 1900s at over fourteen sites in the vicinity of Borama unearthed, among other things, coins identified as having been derived from Kait Bey, the eighteenth Burji Mamluk Sultan of Egypt. Most of these finds were sent to the British Museum for preservation shortly after their discovery.Royal Geographical Society (Great Britain), The Geographical Journal, Volume 87, (Royal Geographical Society: 1936), p.301. In the first half of the 20th century, Borama formed a part of the British Somaliland protectorate. It was later given district status in 1925. In 1933, Sheikh Abdurahman Sheikh Nuur, a Qur'anic teacher and son of Borama's qadi (judge), devised a new orthography for transcribing the Afro-Asiatic Cushitic Somali language. A quite accurate phonetic writing system, this Borama script was principally used by Nuur and his circle of associates in the city.David D. Laitin, Politics, Language, and Thought: The Somali Experience, (University Of Chicago Press: 1977), pp.86-87.I.M. Lewis (1958), The Gadabuursi Somali Script, Bulletin of the School of Oriental and African Studies, University of London, Vol. 21, pp. 134‚Äì156. The alphabet is also generally known as the Gadabuursi script. During the onset of World War II, the town was captured by the Italians. It was re- captured by the British the following year, in 1940. In the post-independence period, Borama was administered as part of the official Awdal administrative region of Somalia. During the Ogaden War in the late 1970s, Borama was one of several northern cities that was aerially bombarded by Ethiopian forces. Geography =Location and habitat= Borama countryside Borama is situated in a mountainous and hilly area. It has green meadows and fields, and represents a key focal point for wildlife. The town's unusual fertility and greenery in the largely arid countryside has attracted many fauna, such as gazelles, birds and camels. =Climate= The prevailing climate in Borama is known as a local steppe climate. The warmest month of the year is June with an average temperature of 24.1 ¬∞C. In January, the average temperature is 17.1 ¬∞C. It is the lowest average temperature of the whole year and the difference in precipitation between the driest month and the wettest month is 110 mm. The average temperatures vary during the year by 7 ¬∞C. Demographics As of 2005, Borama had a population of around 215,616 inhabitants. The Awdal region in which the city is situated is inhabited by people from the Somali ethnic group, with the Gadabuursi subclan of the Dir especially well represented and considered the predominant clan of the region.Samatar, Abdi I. (2001) \\"Somali Reconstruction and Local Initiative: Amoud University,\\" , p. 132. Federico Battera (2005) states about the Awdal Region: > \\"Awdal is mainly inhabited by the Gadabuursi confederation of clans.\\" A UN Report published by Canada: Immigration and Refugee Board of Canada (1999), states concerning Awdal: > \\"The Gadabuursi clan dominates Awdal region.

Roland Marchal (1997) states that numerically, the Gadabuursi are the predominant inhabitants of the Awdal Region: > \\"The Gadabuursi's numerical predominance in Awdal virtually ensures that > Gadabuursi interests drive the politics of the region.\\" Marleen Renders and Ulf Terlinden (2010) both state that the Gadabuursi almost exclusively inhabit the Awdal Region: > \\"Awdal in western Somaliland is situated between Djibouti, Ethiopia and the > Issaq-populated mainland of Somaliland. It is primarily inhabited by the > three sub-clans of the Gadabursi clan, whose traditional institutions > survived the colonial period, Somali statehood and the war in good shape, > remaining functionally intact and highly relevant to public security.\\" There is also a sizeable minority of the Issa subclan of the Dir who mainly inhabit the Zeila district. Education Amoud University Annalena Deaf School - Borama Currently, there are 52 primary and secondary schools in Borama. These schools can be divided into three main categories: public primary and secondary schools, private primary and secondary schools and Religious schools. Total number of students in Borama is 15,314. Transportation Borama. For air transportation, Borama is served by the Borama International Airport. It is the only airport in the Awdal region.

The hymnal contains a wide-variety of traditional Christian hymns and worship songs, many contemporary hymns and songs, and a substantial selection of \\"world music\\" selections (hymns and worship songs from non-European-American) origin, a full lectionary-based Psalter, service music selections, and a selection of liturgies from the UCC Book of Worship (1986). Generally speaking, the hymnal is theologically within the mainline Protestant tradition, with a slant toward liturgical forms.  History  The hymnal project was initiated by action of the UCC General Synod in 1977, only three years after the denomination released its first-ever hymnal as a unified body (the eventually unpopular Hymnal of the United Church of Christ). Prior to that time, congregations used the hymnals from their predecessor traditions: the Pilgrim Hymnal of the Congregational Christian Churches or The Hymnal of the Evangelical and Reformed Church. Because of financial struggles and other issues of greater concern to the denomination, however, work on the project by the denomination's Board for Homeland Ministires (now known as the Local Church Ministries division) did not begin until 1989. The hymnal committee was chaired by James W. Crawford, then pastor of Boston's prestigious Old South Church, and the book was edited by Arthur Clyde. In addition to the standard UCC edition, the hymnal is available in an \\"ecumenical\\" edition (for independent congregations, or those from other denominations) that lacks the United Church of Christ symbol imprint on the cover and some of the liturgical material in the \\"Orders for Worship\\" section. While it is currently the only \\"official\\" hymnal of the UCC, some local UCC congregations have officially adopted a variety of other hymnals (including the earlier ones) that are used for reasons outlined below, including the local church's own traditions as well as dissatisfaction with language revisions. The UCC does not exert authority over its member churches on matters of worship and congregational life, so congregations are free to use whatever hymnal they choose. No comprehensive figures are available as to the exact percentage of UCC congregations that use the NCH; however, among congregations that responded to the 2004-05 denomination-wide survey of worship practices, \\"A majority (58%) use The New Century Hymnal, with 39% using it all or nearly all of the time.\\" (from Worshipping Into God's Future: Summary and Strategies 2005, available at .) Theological Guidelines According to \\"The Making of The New Century Hymnal\\" by James Crawford and Daniel Johnson, the hymnal committee was guided by the following theological guidelines: *\\"The 1995 hymnal of the United Church of Christ enables praise of the One, Sovereign, Triune God, who in infinite mystery is always more than doctrine can describe and whose being calls forth awe, worship, love, faith, and service (Isa. 6:1-8).\\" *\\"We affirm that people of all ages, tongues, races, abilities, and both genders are created in the image and likeness of God (Gen. 1:26, 5:1-2; United Church of Christ Statement of Faith).\\" *\\"We testify to God's call to stewardship of the earth; we are not entitled to hoard, waste or destroy what God has made, but we are called to glorify God with the earth's resources.\\" *\\"We rejoice in providing a rich variety of metaphors for singing of God and inclusive words for singing of people--words that all people can sing.\\" Inclusive Language and The New Century Hymnal The New Century Hymnal is perhaps most famous both in and outside the United Church of Christ for its approach to using \\"inclusive language\\". Arthur Clyde, hymnal editor, writes \\"The New Century Hymnal is not the first hymnal to deal with the issue of inclusive language. It does, however, represent the most even and consistent approach to language of any hymnal yet published. Rather than choosing to present only new hymns in inclusive language, those responsible for the language of this hymnal took the General Synod request for an inclusive hymnal quite literally. Thus hymns of other ages are presented in ways that seek to maintain the theology and beauty of the original but without some of the biases of the time in which they were written.\\" Clyde identifies a number of approaches and concerns implemented in considering hymn text language, which include: *Translation: Some hymns that were written in languages other than English were retranslated to avoid the linguistic biases of the older translation. *Archaic Language: Avoiding \\"thee\\", \\"thine\\", \\"thou\\", \\"ebenezer\\", \\"betide\\", etc. since such language is no longer commonplace in English and is losing its intelligibility to new generations. *Gender of God: Seeking to reduce the solely-masculine use of language for God, and/or balancing masculine images with feminine and non-gendered images (A few Trinitarian references to God \\"The Father\\" were retained). The United Church of Christ describes the New Century Hymnal as \\"the only hymnal released by a Christian church that honors in equal measure both male and female images of God.\\" http://www.ucc.org/about-us/old-firsts.html *Gender of Christ: Retaining masculine language for Jesus when the context is his historical, earthly life, but attempting to avoid masculine language for in reference to \\"the resurrected Jesus, the Christ, who is our Sovereign.\\" *Sensitivity to the use of the word \\"Lord\\": Recognizing that \\"Lord\\" implies authority/sovereignty, but also a gender (male), the hymnal retains many references to Jesus as \\"Lord\\" (particularly in well-known 'memorized' hymns), removes them from non-English texts where Lord was introduced in translation, and changed language in certain other cases. Furthermore, \\"Lord\\" is not employed as a name for God (only Jesus Christ). \\"The overall result of the entire revision process is that the word 'Lord' appears with less frequency than in many other hymnals\\". *Kings, Kingdoms, and Masters: Noting its gendered status, \\"King\\" as a reference for God was avoided as much as possible. Similarly, \\"Master\\" is not only masculine, but also evokes the oppressive imagery of master-and-slave. In both cases, various alternatives were implemented, including the use of \\"Sovereign\\" as implying the same sovereignty metaphor as king. Similarly, in many places the gendered \\"Kingdom\\" was avoided by using words such as \\"realm\\" or \\"dominion.\\" *Militaristic Language: As Clyde writes, \\"It is certain that some will lament the loss of [the militaristic] metaphors, but others cannot sing language of such strong military tendency in a world where violence abounds.\\" In many cases, the message of struggle, conflict, and fight was retained, but with 'toned-down' militarism. For example, in \\"For All the Saints\\", \\"O may thy soldiers, faithful, true, and bold, fight as the saints who nobly fought of old, and win with them the victor's crown of gold\\" becomes \\"Still may your people, faithful, true and bold, live as the saints who nobly fought of old, and share with them a glorious crown of gold.\\" *Trinitarian Language: \\"The hymnal committee developed a statement concerning the trinitarian formula: 'Where a hymn is clearly trinitarian, Father, Son, and Holy Spirit language may be used, but we will consult poets, theologians, and others in order to search for new ways of expressing the Triune God within the orthodox parameters.'\\" *Gender inclusivity with regard to humanity: Language that does not employ male gender-marked words referring to people has been used throughout. *Use of the Word \\"Dark\\": Recognizing the racial implications of many traditional uses where \\"dark\\" was meant as negative, bad, or evil, the hymnal has sought to find different language to indicate the contrast or show the absence of light (\\"shadows\\" instead of \\"darkness\\", or \\"drive the storms of doubt away\\" instead of \\"drive the dark of doubt away\\", as examples) *Language about people's abilities: \\"If the hymn indicates that one must walk or see in this life to participate in the faith, then a change is warranted. If the hymn indicates that walking or seeing or hearing are things that happen when one is utterly overwhelmed by finding oneself in the presence of God in the hereafter, then a change is not necessary.\\" The language revisions made necessary by these principles became very controversial upon the hymnal's release. Some congregations, mainly from more liberal backgrounds , found the changes liberating, while other ones, typically of moderate-to-conservative theological or social bent , have refused to adopt the new hymnal because they feel the changes were too \\"radical\\". Most often, however, complaints about the changes are not theological, but rather because the updated language is seen as un-poetic or as conflicting against the congregation's stored memory (these complaints are particularly made in relation to Christmas carols and American songs, such as America the Beautiful). Similarly, the printing of this hymnal left stanzas disappearing into the binding (instead of leaving enough margin for a binding), and musical lines of text and notes that are poorly typeset on the page. Finally, the omission of certain bass notes in the melodies seem to place an emphasis on singing only the melody and not the harmony in a particular hymn. The 1995 issues of Prism (the theological journal of the UCC) contain critiques and criticisms of the new hymnal.

On September 7, 1976, a tropical depression formed; two days later it accelerated north towards the Baja California Peninsula. Kathleen brushed the Pacific coast of the peninsula as a hurricane on September 9 and made landfall as a fast-moving tropical storm the next day. With its circulation intact and still a tropical storm, Kathleen headed north into the United States and affected California and Arizona. Kathleen finally dissipated late on September 11. Damage in the United States was considerable. California received record rainfall, with over a foot of rain falling in some areas. Flooding caused catastrophic destruction to Ocotillo, and six people drowned. Flooding extended west; railway tracks were destroyed in Palm Desert and high winds and severe flooding were recorded in Arizona. Overall, the damage total was $160 million (1976 USD) and 12 deaths were attributed to the storm. Background Tropical cyclones do not typically bring high winds to the southwestern United States. Most Pacific hurricanes are embedded in easterly winds south of the subtropical ridge, and thus move westward‚Äîaway from large land masses‚Äîuntil they dissipate over cold waters. However, during early autumn, tropical cyclones generally form closer to the Mexican shoreline than average, making them more likely to recurve, or to curve again, northwards under the influence of an approaching trough. These troughs tend to extend farther to the south during the latter part of the Pacific hurricane season, in the period between late August and early October. They also produce a synoptic-scale flow that is conducive to steering hurricanes towards the southwestern United States. However, many hurricanes that approach the southwestern United States tend to be undergoing extratropical transition as they encounter increased wind shear and markedly cooler sea surface temperatures, and as they interact with the deep troughs that caused them to recurve. Kathleen is one of only six recorded tropical cyclones in the eastern Pacific Ocean known to have brought gale-force or hurricane-force winds to the Continental United States. Meteorological history A large area of thunderstorms, with a diameter of about , formed southwest of Acapulco. Moving rapidly west-northwest, a tropical depression formed on September 7. While briefly moving towards the east, the depression intensified into Tropical Storm Kathleen. Moving above sea surface temperatures, Kathleen quickly strengthened. Before passing east of Socorro Island, Kathleen reached its secondary peak with winds of 65 mph (115 km/h). Kathleen then weakened considerably, and by 0600 UTC September 9, Tropical Storm Kathleen was barely a tropical storm. At this time, the system was located at north of the island. Shortly thereafter, Kathleen turned north-northeast into warmer waters. Subsequently, the tropical storm began to re-strengthen. Despite moving rapidly north, the cyclone strengthened into Hurricane Kathleen. The hurricane passed near several ships, and was intercepted by a Hurricane Hunter aircraft early on September 10. It is estimated that the storm peaked in intensity around that time, with winds of 80 mph (130 km/h) and a barometric pressure of . However, Kathleen never developed an eye. About an hour after the first flight reached Kathleen, a second flight suggested that Kathleen had weakened back into a tropical storm. With precipitation falling in the United States, some north of the cyclone's atmospheric circulation, Kathleen's motion accelerated to speeds of -. After crossing the Point Eugenia peninsula (the cyclone's first landfall) later on the morning of September 10, Kathleen made its second landfall south of Ensenada at 1130 UTC the same day. Unlike most tropical cyclones, Kathleen weakened slowly over California. Tropical Storm Kathleen weakened further into a depression over southern California and shortly thereafter, moved across Death Valley. On September 11, Kathleen entered western Nevada. Finally, the center became difficult to locate, and the depression dissipated later on September 11. After undergoing a Fujiwhara- like interaction, where two circulations interact with each other, with a low- pressure area stalled off the Pacific coast, moisture later spread into the northwestern part of the United States. After the stalled low was pulled inland, Kathleen combined with the low to produce additional rainfall over parts of California. Impact =Mexico= The bulk of the rainfall from the tropical cyclone fell over Baja California and Baja California Sur, to the east of its track. The highest amount reported was in San Antonio. Kathleen's rainfall =Arizona= On September 10‚Äì11, gale-force winds caused considerable damage to the city of Yuma. For a time, the sustained winds exceeded , with gusts up to . The National Weather Service's forecast office in Tucson estimates that tropical storm-force winds extended as far east as Pima County, and as far north as Lake Havasu. Rains caused severe flash- flooding in Mohave County. One man was killed when the wind blew a palm tree onto his mobile home and 13 people across the state were hurt. The Tucson metropolitan area was particularly hard hit with flash flooding, with golf- ball size hail. On Mount Lemmon, the hail reached a depth of . While most of the rainfall from Tropical Storm Kathleen fell in California, fell at the Davis Dam on the Colorado River. Aerial photo of damage in Ocotillo, California =California= The state received record rainfall, with falling on the southern slopes of Mount San Gorgonio, and accumulated on Mount Laguna. Because the village is situated atop an alluvial fan, a wall of water exited a mountain canyon. Ocotillo was flooded with - of water; subsequently, half the town was destroyed. Six people drowned in the mud and waters in the town and two people were initially reported missing, though they were later found by officials. Overall, Ocotllio was 70%‚Äì80% destroyed. Officials evacuated 175 people from the flooded area of Ocotillo and the nearby communities that surround the Salton Sea; the sea rose -. A quarter mile of Interstate 8 and a 60-foot bridge were destroyed by the flood, which also washed away mobile homes, trucks, and cars. In Los Angeles, two people died of injuries suffered from slippery roads. One man drowned in El Centro. and two people drowned when their cars tumbled into the water near the city. Record flood stage was attained at numerous streams near the Coachella Valley. Widespread property damage was recorded on the eastern slopes of the Sierra Nevada as well as the nearby desert. Across the San Joaquin Valley, 2/3 of the $150 million raisin crop was threatened. Crops including cotton, lettuce, and hay were damaged. About half of the lettuce in the Palo Verde Valley were lost. Homeowners in Palm Desert suffered $4 million in damage from the storm; the town received more than a year's worth of rainfall in a matter of days. No serious injuries were reported throughout the desert city, though two agricultural dikes broke. Several miles of railway track, including three trestles that belonged to the San Diego and Arizona Eastern Railway, were destroyed and five others were damaged. At more than 50 other locations, tracks were buried by mudslides or had the ground under them washed away. After assessing the damage from Kathleen, the Southern Pacific Transportation Company decided in 1977 to abandon most of the railroad. The United States Gypsum narrow gauge railroad line from Plaster City and the Santa Fe Railway line from Rice to Blythe also had tracks damaged, and a Santa Fe freight train was stranded and quickly rescued. A section of Interstate 8 from Yuma to San Diego was destroyed. Floodwaters caused by the storm Overall, hundreds of homes were damaged or destroyed; Tropical Storm Kathleen was described as a one-in- 160-year event. Total damage was $160 million, making Kathleen one of the costliest tropical storms in state history. Parts of California were declared a disaster area, and flash flood watches were issued throughout Southern California, including the desert and mountains. Flash flood warnings were also issued for parts of California, as well as nearby states Nevada and Arizona, but were dropped as the rain tampered off on September 11. =Rest of the United States= In Wyoming, the cyclone is credited for the first known sighting of a white ibis in the state's history. In Montana, Kathleen dropped locally heavy rainfall approaching in localized spots, enough to become the wettest known tropical cyclone in state history. The remnants of the storm also affected Oregon and Idaho.

The idea behind the game is to use the computational power of humans to perform a task that computers cannot (originally, image recognition) by packaging the task as a game. It was originally conceived by Luis von Ahn of Carnegie Mellon University. Google bought a licence to create its own version of the game (Google Image Labeler) in 2006 in order to return better search results for its online images. The licence of the data acquired by Ahn's ESP game, or the Google version, is not clear. Google's version was shut down on September 16, 2011 as part of the Google Labs closure in September 2011.  Concept  Image recognition is a task that is difficult for computers to perform independently. Humans are perfectly capable of it, but are not necessarily willing. By making the recognition task a \\"game\\", people are more likely to participate. When questioned about how much they enjoyed playing the game, collected data from users was extremely positive. The applications and uses of having so many labeled images are significant; for example, more accurate image searching and accessibility for visually impaired users, by reading out an image's labels. Partnering two people to label images makes it more likely that entered words will be accurate. Since the only thing the two partners have in common is that they both see the same image, they must enter reasonable labels to have any chance of agreeing on one. The ESP Game as it is currently implemented encourages players to assign ‚Äúobvious‚Äù labels, which are most likely to lead to an agreement with the partner. But these labels can often be deduced from the labels already present using an appropriate language model and such labels therefore add only little information to the system. A Microsoft research project assigns probabilities to the next label to be added. This model is then used in a program, which plays the ESP game without looking at the image.http://research.microsoft.com/apps/pubs/default.aspx?id=70638 ESP-game authors presented evidence that the labels produced using the game were indeed useful descriptions of the images. The results of searching for randomly chosen keywords were presented and show that the proportion of appropriate images when searching using the labels generated by the game is extremely high. Further evaluation was achieved by comparing the labels generated using the game to labels generated by participants that were asked to describe the images.  Rules of the game  Once logged in, a user is automatically matched with a random partner. The partners do not know each other's identity and they cannot communicate. Once matched, they will both be shown the same image. Their task is to agree on a word that would be an appropriate label for the image. They both enter possible words, and once a word is entered by both partners (not necessarily at the same time), that word is agreed upon, and that word becomes a label for the image. Once they agree on a word, they are shown another image. They have two and a half minutes to label 15 images. Both partners have the option to pass; that is, give up on an image. Once one partner passes, the other partner is shown a message that their partner wishes to pass. Both partners must pass for a new image to be shown. Some images have ‚Äútaboo‚Äù words; that is, words that cannot be entered as possible labels. These words are usually related to the image and make the game harder as they prevent common words to be used to label the image. Taboo words are obtained from the game itself. The first time an image is used in the game, it will have no taboo words. If the image is ever used again, it will have one taboo word: the word that resulted from the previous agreement. The next time the image is used, it will have two taboo words, and so on. ‚ÄúTaboo‚Äù words is done automatically by the system: once an image has been labeled enough times with the same word, that word becomes taboo so that the image will get a variety of different words as labels. Occasionally, the game will be played solo, without a human partner, with the ESP Game itself acting as the opponent and delivering a series of pre-determined labels to the single human player (which have been harvested from labels given to the image during the course of earlier games played by real humans). This is necessary if there are an odd number of people playing the game. In late 2008, the game was rebranded as GWAP (\\"game with a purpose\\"), with a new user interface. Some other games that were also created by Luis von Ahn, such as ‚ÄúPeekaboom‚Äù and ‚ÄúPhetch‚Äù, were discontinued at that point. = Cheating = Ahn has described countermeasures which prevent players from \\"cheating\\" the game, and introducing false data into the system. By giving players occasional test images for which common labels are known, it is possible to check that players are answering honestly, and a player's guesses are only stored if they successfully label the test images.Google Tech Talk on human computation by Luis von Ahn Furthermore, a label is only stored after a certain number of players (N) have agreed on it. At this point, all of the taboo lists for the images are deleted and the image is returned to the game pool as if it were a fresh image. If X is the probability of a label being incorrect despite a player having successfully labelled test images, then after N repetitions the probability of corruption is X^N, assuming that end repetitions are independent of each other.  Image selection  The choice of images used by the ESP game makes a difference in the player's experience. The game would be less entertaining if all the images were chosen from a single site and were all extremely similar. The first run of the ESP game used a collection of 350,000 images chosen by the developers. Later versions selected images at random from the web, using a small amount of filtering. Such images are reintroduced into the game several times until they are fully labeled.Luis von Ahn. \\"Human Computation\\". 2005 The random images were chosen using \\"Random Bounce Me\\", a website that selects a page at random from the Google database. ‚ÄúRandom Bounce Me‚Äù was queried repeatedly, each time collecting all JPEG and GIF images in the random page, except for images that did not fit the criteria: blank images, images that consist of a single color, images that are smaller than 20 pixels on either dimension, and images with an aspect ratio greater than 4.5 or smaller than 1/4.5. This process was repeated until 350,000 images were collected. The images were then rescaled to fit the game's display. Fifteen different images from the 350,000 are chosen for each session of the game.

The saint, whose body was kept as a holy relic, quickly became the object of popular veneration, as he came to be known as a worker of miraculous healings. On the site of his supposed life and martyrdom a Monastery of the Annunciation of Our Lady (ŒôŒµœÅŒ¨ ŒúŒøŒΩŒÆ ŒïœÖŒ±Œ≥Œ≥ŒµŒªŒπœÉŒºŒøœç œÑŒ∑œÇ ŒòŒµŒøœÑœåŒ∫ŒøœÖ) was later erected. In 1998, St. Ephraim was officially declared a saint by the Synod of the Orthodox Church in Greece, which was approved by the Patriarch of Constantinople in 2011. Biography According to the dreams revealed to Makaria Desipri, St. Ephraim was born on 14 September 1384 in Trikala, Thessalia. His civil name was Konstantinos Morphes. He became a monk, took the monastic name of Ephraim and moved to Attica to live in what was then the Monastery of the Annunciation of Our Lady on Mount Amomon. In 1424 the monastery was destroyed by marauding Ottoman troops. Ephraim escaped and lived for another year as a hermit among the ruins of the monastery. In September 1425 he was captured in another Turkish raid. He was held captive and tormented for more than eight months, until he was finally tortured to death on 5 May 1426. A mulberry tree, believed to be that on which the saint was hanged, is today shown as an object of veneration inside the re-erected monastery. Veneration St. Ephraim is portrayed in iconography as a slim, ascetic figure with black hair and beard, clad in the black robes of a monk. His feast days are 3 January (the anniversary of the discovery of his body), and 5 May (the anniversary of his martyrdom). The monastery in Nea Makri, the centre of the saint's veneration and his miracle-working, is now a much-frequented place of pilgrimage attracting thousands of visitors, especially people praying for the healing of illnesses. The monastery was the object of a public scandal in 2005, as the nuns of the monastery and the bishop of Attica accused each other of embezzling money from pilgrims' donations.

It is part of the Chevron Renaissance development that also includes the Towers of Chevron Renaissance apartments and hotel. The centre is by area and includes a Coles supermarket, 2 Liquorlands and approximately 60 speciality tenants.  History  The current site once accommodated the Chevron Hotel, which was a Gold Coast landmark. The new development was named Chevron Renaissance, as it is widely considered to be a catalyst in the revitalising of the Surfers Paradise tourist district and was completed in October 2000. The original hotel housed the Skyline Lounge (opened August, 1957), which was a popular landmark bar and nightclub where many local and international acts would perform. The lounge was the launching pad for many great Australian performers such as Johnny O'Keefe, Ricky May and Colleen Hewett. In 2014, the Chevron Renaissance Shopping Centre underwent a $5 million upgrade. This included the creation of 'Chevron Lane'; a Melbourne styled laneway filled with eclectic street food operators such as Viet Baguettes and Harmoni-T. The laneway features exposed brickwork, corrugated roller doors, street art and festoon lighting. An open air piazza was also upgraded to include a shade sail structure, rustic wood features, garden beds and a water fountain was transformed into a food and beverage area. In 2015 the Chevron Renaissance Shopping Centre was purchased by Precision Group for $74 million from Morgan Stanley's Arena Investment Management in a deal backed by the Bank of China.

The human eye is very sensitive, and prolonged exposure to direct sunlight can lead to solar retinopathy, pterygium, cataracts, and often blindness. Studies have shown that even when viewing a solar eclipse the eye can still be exposed to harmful levels of ultraviolet radiation.

It is the eighth novel to feature the mysterious Albert Campion, aided as usual by his butler/valet/bodyguard Magersfontein Lugg.  Plot summary  An old friend of Albert Campion, \\"Uncle\\" William Faraday, has written a successful book that has been turned into a hit musical comedy. Jimmy Sutane, an established actor and dancer, is the star of the musical. But recently someone has it in for Sutane and has started playing harmless practical jokes that have caused the highly emotional Jimmy much trauma. Jimmy asks Campion to look into who the prankster may be. So Campion takes a trip to the Sutane household, where he unexpectedly finds more than he bargained for. Jimmy Sutane's house is a strange mix of the theatrical and the snobbish. And into this mix comes Chloe Pye, an overdone and melodramatic has-been actress that no one seems to like. When she is accidentally run over by Jimmy Sutane in his car, no one seems upset and everyone is eager to call it an accident. But Campion is not so certain, and the more he investigates the less he desires to find out about the world of the Sutanes. Campion must deal with high strung entertainers and his own emotions as he tries to find out if a murder even happened, and who is still playing tricks on the star and his family. It turns out that Squire Mercer, a genius musician who lives with the Sutanes, was once married to Chloe Pye. She wanted to leave him for Jimmy Sutane, and he threatened never to divorce her. She told him that divorce wasn't necessary since she was still married to someone else, thereby committing bigamy with Squire Mercer. Her return to the Sutane household was to get back into the good graces of Squire Mercer so that he would fall back in love with her and support her financially. Instead he gets annoyed and angry at her advances and kills her. Then he throws her body off a bridge in front of Jimmy Sutane's car so that the whole thing will look like an accident. Unfortunately Sutane's understudy, who has been playing the pranks on Sutane because he wants to play the lead role in the hit show, witnessed the whole of Chloe's \\"accident\\". When he and several innocent bystanders are killed by one of Mercer's old-time criminal associates, everything is gradually uncovered by the police. Unfortunately, Campion's love for Sutane's wife clouds his judgement so that he thinks Jimmy has actually murdered both Chloe and his understudy. It is only at the end that he discovers the truth for himself. Film, TV or theatrical adaptations  The story has twice been adapted for television for the BBC; in 1959 for Campion, and again in 1990, starring Peter Davison as Campion and Brian Glover as Lugg.

With Special Economic Zone Authority SEZAD aiming to complete Duqm development by 2040. Creating estimated 250,000 population, and 150,000 employment for the city.  History and economy  Duqm was a small fishing settlement of the Janubah tribe on the coast of southern Oman, when a party of soldiers of the Muscat and Oman Field Force and geologists of Petroleum Development Oman landed in February 1954 to begin the modern oil exploration of central Oman. Today it is an industrial oil town with a notable port. The town has been looking to increase tourism in the area with the Oman Tourism Development Company, and is now central to the state's development goals, with a 25-year plan formulated in 1995 to increase its population to 100,000 by 2020. The port has undergone development and a shipbuilding facility to facilitate the port was built; development has been ongoing by the Jan De Nul Group, improving the breakwaters and quay walls. In March 2005, Oman's Ministry of Transport and Communications awarded the Parsons Corporation a contract to study and design a new Duqm Jaaluni Airport in hopes of increasing tourism. Oman Air has begun services at the airport on July 23, 2014. The planned Oman Railways project will also include a link to Duqm Port. In 2008, Intercontinental Hotels announced they were to build a 213-room hotel, Crowne Plaza Duqm. A coal-fired power plant has also been approved in Duqm with the aim of reducing dependency on natural gas, and Oman has formed a $2 billion deal with South Korea to facilitate it. Duqm's port and industrial zone has also received heavy Chinese investment. According to The Economist in 2013, \\"If Duqm took off, sleepy Oman might‚Äîsay the planners‚Äîchallenge nearby Dubai‚Äôs dominance as the region‚Äôs trading hub\\" with a geographically favourable location that links to Asia, Europe and Arabia, that also avoids the tensions of the nearby Persian Gulf. Since 2018, SEZAD has signed deal with Duqm refinery for leasing of 900Ha land, with capacity of refining 230,000 barrels of crude oil per day.

He was a nephew of Eleuth√®re Ir√©n√©e du Pont, the founder of the E. I. du Pont de Nemours and Company, and a member of the Delaware General Assembly. Early life Du Pont was born March 29, 1797, in Charleston, South Carolina, the eldest son of French immigrants Victor Marie du Pont de Nemours (born 1767 in Paris) and Gabrielle Jos√©phine de la Fite de Pelleport (born 1770 in Stenay). He lived with his parents in New York City until they established themselves in the wool-manufacturing business across from the Brandywine Creek from the Eleutherian Mills near Greenville, Delaware. He was educated at Mount Airy College in Germantown, Philadelphia, from 1809 to 1813, when he left school to work with his father in Delaware. Professional career In 1815, the textile manufacturing company of Du Pont, Bauduy & Co. ended acrimoniously. :fr:Pierre de Bauduy de Bellevue, a Frenchman who had invested in the business in 1803, eventually sued the du Ponts over various disagreements. (The lawsuit was decided in the du Pont's favor in 1924.) After de Bauduy's departure, Charles and his father formed the partnership of Victor & Charles I. du Pont de Nemours & Co. After Victor's death in 1827, the firm continued to operate as Charles I. du Pont & Co., with the U.S. Army as a major client for its cloth. Charlies retired in 1856, at which point E.I. duPont de Nemours & Co. purchased his company. Civic and political career In addition to his business interest, du Pont was very active in civic and political affairs. Du Pont was a member of the Whig Party, who served in the State Senate from New Castle County for four terms in the Delaware General Assembly from 1841-1847. He was elected a director of the Farmers' Bank of Delaware in 1830, and served as president of the bank from 1865-1868. In 1853, he was made director of the Delaware Railroad Company, and was also a director of the Philadelphia, Wilmington & Baltimore Railroad Company and the Columbia Insurance Co. of Philadelphia. He was also of the Brandywine Manufacturers' Sunday School and vice president of the Delaware Improvement Association. Family Anne (Ridgeley) du Pont In 1824, du Pont married Dorcas Montgomery Van Dyke (born 1806), daughter of U.S. Senator and Representative Nicholas Van Dyke III and granddaughter of Delaware Governor Nicholas Van Dyke Jr. Their wedding was attended by the Marquis de Lafayette. They had three children: Victor, Mary Van Dyke and Charles Jr. After Dorcas' death in 1838, he married Ann Ridgely (born 1815). Like his first wife, Ridgely was the daughter of a U.S. Senator and Representative from Delaware, Henry M. Ridgely. They had two children: Am√©lia Elizabeth (who married her cousin Eugene du Pont) and Henry Ridgely. Du Pont died January 31, 1869, at Louviers, his family estate, and is buried at the Du Pont de Nemours Cemetery at Winterthur, near Greenville.

Biography Born in Westmoreland Parish, Jamaica, Johnson started to play music with the Virtues as a bass player before moving into management of the group.Larkin, Colin (1998) The Virgin Encyclopedia of Reggae, Virgin Books, , p. 139 When the band split up he worked as an insurance salesman. He first appeared as a record producer in 1968, when he launched his own record label, \\"Harry J\\", by releasing The Beltones' local hit \\"No More Heartaches\\", one of the earliest reggae songs to be recorded. His agreement with Coxsone Dodd allowed him to use Studio One's facilities, where he produced the hit \\"Cuss Cuss\\" with singer Lloyd Robinson, which became one of the most covered riddims in Jamaica. Johnson also released music under a subsidiary label, Jaywax. In October 1969, he met success in the UK with \\"The Liquidator\\" (number 9 in the UK Singles Chart) recorded with his sessionband, The Harry J All Stars (it was also a hit in 1980, reaching number 42).Harry J All-Stars, Chart Stats, retrieved 23 May 2010Harry J All-Stars And The Pioneers, Chart Stats, retrieved 23 May 2010 This single became one of the anthems of the emerging skinhead youth subculture; together with other instrumental hits released in the UK through his own subdivision \\"Harry J\\" on Trojan Records, on a compilation album of the same name. In the beginning of the 1970s he enjoyed another big success with the vocal duo Bob and Marcia with the song \\"Young, Gifted and Black\\". His productions also included Jamaican hits with DJs like Winston Blake or Scotty among others, and many dub versions. =Harry J Studio= Johnson is mainly known for his Harry J Studio where Bob Marley & The Wailers recorded some of their albums in the 1970s.Thompson, Dave (2002) Reggae & Caribbean Music, Backbeat Books, , p. 311-2 The studio was also a 'must stop' hangout of many British and other musicians including the Rolling Stones, The Who, and Grace Jones. In addition, Chris Blackwell, founder of Island Records, could be found hanging out in the sound room prior to moving to England in the early 1970s. In 1972, Harry Johnson sold his record shop and set up his own recording studio \\"Harry J\\", on 10 Roosevelt Avenue, Uptown Kingston, where he employed Sid Bucknor and later Sylvan Morris as resident recording engineer. Harry J Studio soon became one of the most famous Jamaican studios after having recorded several Bob Marley & The Wailers albums from 1973 to 1976 before the Tuff Gong era; such as Rastaman Vibration and Catch A Fire. Johnson's deal with Island Records led him to record artists such as Burning Spear and The Heptones. Throughout the 1970s and the 1980s, assisted by former Studio One sound engineer Sylvan Morris, he also recorded Ken Boothe, Augustus Pablo, The Cables and the American pop singer, Johnny Nash, and produced albums by Zap Pow and Sheila Hylton. In 2000, after seven years of inactivity, Stephen Stewart who worked in the early years alongside Sylvan Morris, refurbished, re-equipped and reopened Harry J Studio. Since then under the management of Stewart the studio has seen the return of Burning Spear, Toots, Shaggy, Sly & Robbie, and newer projects of Shakira, Papa Sam/Kirk Franklyn, Luciano and Sizzla.

It was formerly an island (ostr√≥w in Old Polish language) between branches of the Oder River. History Archaeological excavations have shown that the western part of Ostr√≥w Tumski, between the Church of St. Martin and the Holy Cross, was the first area to be inhabited. The first, wooden church (St. Martin), dating from the 10th century, was surrounded by defensive walls built on the banks of the river. The island had approximately 1,500 inhabitants at that time. The first constructions on Ostr√≥w Tumski were built in the 10th century by the Piast dynasty, and were made from wood. The first building from solid material was St. Martin's chapel, built probably at the beginning of the eleventh century by Benedictine monks. Not long after the first cathedral was raised, in place of the small church. Religious buildings appeared in Ostr√≥w Tumski because during the Congress of Gniezno in AD 1000, it was decided to create a bishopric in Wroc≈Çaw. In 1163 the settlement was raided by Boleslaw I the Tall who had returned from his banishment. After taking control of the area and waiting for the political situation in Silesia to stabilize, he chose Ostr√≥w Tumski as his new capital. He began replacing the wooden defenses with brick ones and build a Roman-style residence. In 1315 Ostr√≥w Tumski was sold to the church. Since the island ceased to be under secular jurisdiction, it was often used by those who had broken the law in Wroc≈Çaw, as a place of sanctuary. An interesting indication of the special status of the island was a ban on wearing any headdress by men, effective even on Tumski Bridge beyond the border pole of this small \\"ecclesiastical nation\\" (the law also applied to royalty). Ostr√≥w Tumski was sometimes inhabited by Nicolaus Copernicus, who in the years 1503-1538 was in the scholastic Wroc≈Çaw's Church of the Holy Cross. In 1766 at Ostr√≥w Tumski, Giacomo Casanova lived at the house of Father Bastiani.

Make Trade Fair is a campaign organized by Oxfam International to promote trade justice and fair trade among governments, institutions, and multinational corporations. Objectives The campaign has focused on the elimination of several trade practices: * Dumping, which occurs when highly subsidized, surplus commodities from developed countries such as rice, cotton, corn, and sugar are sold at low prices and farmers from poor countries have difficulty competing. It is believed that this creates an uneven playing field where farmers in developing countries are unable to compete in the market with cheaper foreign produce and crops. * Tariffs, where nations enforce high taxes on imported goods, restricting the sales of products from other nations. * Unbalanced labour rights for women, who often perceive that they earn lower wages than their male counterparts. * Stringent patent issues, that prevent the prices of medication, software, and textbooks (e.g. Gene patents, Chemical patents, and Software patents) from being lowered. Thus, such essential goods are often inaccessible to developing nations. Key events =The Big Noise= Launched in April 2002, the Big Noise is a worldwide petition that calls for governments to help end unfair trade practices. By the end of 2005, some 17.8 million signatures have been received. Desmond Tutu was the honorary 1 millionth signee to the petition in 2003. Other celebrities who have lent their names to the petition include the Dalai Lama, United Nations Secretary-General Kofi Annan, and musicians Bono and Coldplay; specifically Chris Martin who would, before performing on stage, draw an equal sign (mistaken by many to be a tattoo) on his hand. However, this could also be a reference to the Human Rights Campaign. The petition was also coupled with a popular photo campaign, where celebrities were \\"dumped\\" with various crops and foodstuffs to highlight the practice of dumping, which some perceive to be unfair. Colin Firth, Thom Yorke, Jamelia, and Haile Gebrselassie were a few of the celebrities to take part in this venture. =Make Trade Fair concerts= In 2002 and 2004, special benefit concerts were held in London to promote the Make Trade Fair campaign. Proceeds from the shows went to aid Oxfam's promotional campaigns. Produced by Emily Eavis, Marianne Troup, and Lily Sobhani, performers from the 2002 \\"Fairplay\\" gig include Chris Martin and Jonny Buckland from Coldplay, Noel Gallagher, and Ms. Dynamite, while the 2004 event included Michael Stipe, Razorlight, and The Thrills. In 2008, the Make Trade Fair support CD The Cake Sale was produced. The 9 songs were performed by Lisa Hannigan, Nina Persson, Gary Lightbody, Gemma Hayes, Glen Hansard, Josh Ritter, Conor Deasy and Neil Hannon, and written by Deasy, Hansard, Emm Gryner, Paul Noonan, Ollie Cole, Damien Rice and others. =WTO Ministerial Conference of 2005= The Make Trade Fair campaign was active at the WTO Ministerial Conference of 2005, held in Hong Kong, People's Republic of China. Various demonstrations and activities were held, including the handover of some 17.8 million signatures on the Big Noise petition to WTO Director General Pascal Lamy.

Early life  Chhatrasal was born in Kachar Kachnai on 4 May 1649, to Champat Rai and Lal Kunwar into the Bundela Rajput clan. He was a descendant of Rudra Pratap Singh of Orchha.Bundela Rajas of Bundelkhand (Panna) His ancestors were vassals of the Mughal emperor.  Power Struggle against the Mughals  Chhatrapati Shivaji sending Chhatrasal to liberate his ancestral lands. Chhatrasal was 12 when his father Champat Rai of Mahoba was killed by the Mughals. Inspired by Chhatrapati Shivaji's ideals he travelled to Maharashtra and sought guidance from him. Chhatrasal raised the banner of revolt against the Mughals in Bundelkhand at the age of 22, with an army of 5 horsemen and 25 swordsmen, in 1671.Advanced Study in the History of Modern India 1707-1813 pg.106 During the first ten years of his revolt he conquered a large tract of land between Chitrakoot, Chhatarpur and Panna on the east and Gwalior on the west. His domains stretched from Kalpi in the north to Sagar, Garhakota, Shahgarh and Damoh in the south. Some of the Mughal generals who were defeated by him were Rohilla Khan, Kaliq, Munawwar Khan, Sadruddin, Sheikh Anwar, Sayyid Latif, Bahlol Khan and Abdus Ahmed. Chhatrasal was able to defeat the Mughals until he was attacked by Muhammad Khan Bangash on December 1728. Chhatrasal was 79 years old when he led his army against Bangash, after a severe battle Chhatrasal was defeated and was forced to retreat to his fort at Jaitpur. The Mughals besieged him and conquered most of his territories. Chhatrasal made several attempts to ask the Peshwa for help however the Peshwa was busy and could not help Chhatrasal until March 1729. In a letter sent to Bajirao, Chhatrasal wrote: \\"Know you Bajirao! That I am in the same plight in which the famous elephant was when caught by the crocodile. My valiant race is on the point of extinction. Come and save my honour\\".Srinivasan, Bajirao I, pg77 Peshwa Bajirao I personally led his army towards Bundelkhand and attacked several Mughal outposts, the Mughal supplies were completely cut off by the swift Cavalry of the Peshwa. Bangash who was surprised by the sudden involvement of the Marathas, sent several letters to the Mughal emperor for aid, however upon being denied any help he started negotiations with Chhatrasal and Bajirao. Bangash was allowed to retreat on the condition that he never returns or shows aggression towards Bundelkhand. Chhatrasal rewarded the peshwa with large tracts of lands and diamond mines in Bundelkhand which helped the Marathas to gain access in Central and North India.Advanced Study in the History of Modern India 1707-1813 pg.106Advance Study in the History of Modern India (Volume-1: 1707-1803) By G.S.Chhabra pg.24  Relations with Bajirao I  Mastani, the wife of the Maratha Peshwa Baji Rao I was Chhatrasal's daughter The Maratha Peshwa Baji Rao I's second wife Mastani was Chhatrasal's daughter. In his book Mastani, the historian D. G. Godse states that the relationship between Chhatrasal and Baji Rao I was like that of father and son. Before his death on 20 December 1731, Chhatrasal bequeathed Mahoba and the surrounding area to Baji Rao I in return for Baji Rao's assistance against the Mughals.  Patron of literature  Chhatrasal was a patron of literature, and his court housed several noted poets. His eulogies written by Kavi Bhushan, Lal Kavi, Bakhshi Hansaraj and other court poets helped him gain lasting fame.  Religious views  Chhatrasal was a disciple of Mahamati Prannathji and accepted him as his guru. Their meeting took place in Mau Sahaniya in 1683, a place near Panna. His nephew Dev Karanji who had met Swami Prannathji, earlier in Ramnagar, was instrumental for this meeting. Chhatrasal was highly impressed of Prannathji and became his disciple. When Maharaja Chhatrasal came to meet him, he was going for a battle against Mughals. Swami Prannathji gave him his own sword and covered his head with a scarf, saying, \\"You will always be victorious. Diamond mines will be discovered in your land and you will become a great emperor.\\" His prophecy came true and even today Panna region is famous for their diamond mines. Swami Prannathji was not only the religious Guru of Chhatrasal; but he guided him too in political, social, and economic matters. It was by being granted the boon of finding diamonds in Panna by Swami Prannathji that Maharaja Chhatrasal became prosperous.Pranami Faith : Saints of Pranami Dharma : TextsThe Pranami Faith: Beyond \`Hindu‚Äô and \`Muslim‚Äô- Dominique-Sila KhanIdentity and religion: foundations of anti-Islamism in India By Amalendu Misra  Successors and descendants  Chhatrasal gave a third of his kingdom to Marathas under Peshwa Baji Rao I for his assistance, the other parts of his kingdom was divided amongst his sons. The eldest son, Harde Sah was given the kingdom of Panna State; second son, Jagat Rai was given Jaitpur State and the youngest son Bharti Chand was given Jaso State. The Jaitpur State was further divided into Ajaigarh State, Bijawar State, Charkhari State and Chhatarpur State by his descendants.

It was founded by Qazi Anwar Hussain. Its books are aimed at young Bangladeshi readers, and includes translations of Western literary classics into the Bengali language. History Sheba Prokashoni was founded in May, 1963 by Qazi Anwar Hussain . Its name may have derived from the first syllables of Shegun Bagan, now renamed as Shegun Bagicha, the neighbourhood of Dhaka city where its offices are located. The literal meaning of the Bengali word \\"Sheba\\" is \\"service.\\" Sheba's focus, from its inception, has been to produce mass-market popular Bengali paperbacks that are both attractively-written and affordably priced. Its first successful product was Kuasha (Kuasha-1, first edition published on June 1964 ), a short-lived modern-Robin Hood style adventure series. This was closely followed by the Masud Rana, a spy-thriller series, one of Sheba's most enduring and popular imprints. Masud Rana These books described the adventures of its eponymous hero Masud Rana, an international spy of Bangladeshi origin, closely resembling James Bond in his expertise with weapons and women. Although the author of the series is Qazi Anwar Hussain, Hossain liberally borrows plot lines from popular Western spy thrillers. Nonetheless, the series was a boon for young people in post-war Bangladesh, who had few entertainment alternatives in an era pre-dating video games, cable TV and the internet. The books caused concern among some middle-class parents because of their occasional racy content, and reading Masud Rana was an activity often frowned upon. The series eventually ran to well over a hundred individual titles. There was even a Bengali action thriller movie based on Masud Rana's character. The title was also Masud Rana. It came out in 1975 with famous actor Sohel Rana (real name:Masud Parvez) in the lead role of Masud Rana. It was the first film for Sohel Rana as a lead actor. During the 1980s, Sheba introduced several more imprints that were as popular as they were profitable. Among these, the most notable were: Kishore Classic series This series introduced the finest works of world literature to a young Bangladeshi audience. The Hossain brothers and their staff were adept at producing translations that were brisk and taut, contemporary and well written. Through their mediation, the kishore or teenagers of Bangladesh made their first (and in most cases, only) acquaintance with the works of Jules Verne, Charles Dickens, Sir Walter Scott, Mark Twain, Sir Arthur Conan Doyle, Alexandre Dumas, p√®re and many others. The translations were usually condensed forms of the original titles and ran to 200-300 pages. While Sheba played a vital role in encouraging reading among young people, making such translations available is arguably its most important contributions. =Translators of Sheba= The books from Kishore Classic series are translated by Neaz Morshed (original name: Neaz Morshed Quaderi), Rakib Hasan, Asaduzzaman, Kazi Shahnoor Hussain, Babul Alam etc.http://archive.thedailystar.net/beta2/news/sheba-and- those-early-reading-years/ Tin Goyenda The Tin Goyenda series was written by Rakib Hasan, and described the adventures of Kishore Pasha, a Bangladeshi- American teen detective, and his two friends Musa Aman and Robin Milford. The cerebral Kishore lives with his aunt and uncle Rashed in California, and is much given to pinching his lower lip while pondering some knotty problem from his latest case. Robin, his white Irish American friend, is the bespectacled geek, and the irrepressible Musa, a black American Muslim boy, provides comic relief. The series is a remake of Robert Arthur, Jr.'s Three Investigators. Rakib Hasan also adopted plot lines from The Famous Five as well as The Hardy Boys and similar teen-detective titles, but his readers, unaware of such issues, consumed the Tin Goyenda books avidly. Adaptations of Western Series These were adaptations of pulp cowboy Westerns by authors such as Louis L'Amour. The series introduced the Wild West to the Bengali language. Aleyar Pichche (Bengali:- Benhind the Light) was the first Western adapted book in Bangla, written by Qazi Mahbub Hossain. The series was also quite successful and ran to several dozen titles. Other popular contributors in this series include Saokot Hossain and Rowshan Jamil. Other Publications Other popular titles by Sheba includes books on self-help such as Atto-Shommohon (Bengali:- ‡¶Ü‡¶§‡ßç‡¶§-‡¶∏‡¶Æ‡¶π‡¶®) or Self-Hypnosis; sports trivia; horror (The Exorcist and The Omen, published in 3 volumes Oshuvo Shongket (The Omen), Abar Oshuvo Songket (Omen Again) and Shesh Oshuvo Songket (The Last Omen) ); and real- world mysteries like UFOs and the Bermuda Triangle. For many years, it also published a monthly magazine called Rohoshsho Potrika or Mystery Magazine, featuring stories and articles of general interest. A juvenile magazine in the name of Kishore Potrika is also published from Sheba Prokashoni. Sheba titles are characterized by their distinctive red-and-yellow butterfly logo.

Student budget protests =April 1, 2010 budget teach-in= On April 1, 2010, about 200 students attending Encinal High School staged a \\"teach-in\\" protest in light of possible further budget cuts from the AUSD and closure of the school. Teachers and students planned a series of classes that were divided into two sessions with a break in between that included free food (from the Barbeque Club) and live music from certain Encinal staff members. Most of the classes were led by teachers, but two were taught by seniors (including a \\"no boundaries\\" music class led by Matt Ortega). The students who attended showcased their Jet Pride by participating in a variety of unique classes including how to make salt water taffy through chemistry, protest poetry and art, a music class with no musical boundaries, and cow eyeball dissection. A small point that the coordinators of this event wanted to get across was the date that was chosen for it: April 1, 2010 was the Thursday before Encinal's spring break began.Encinal students stage learn-in April 2, 2010 =March 2008 student walkouts= On March 5, 2008, about 1,000 students from Encinal High School walked out of class to protest the budget cuts for the 2008‚Äì2009 school year. The budget cuts were a result of the $4 billion budget cut approved by California governor Arnold Schwarzenegger. The cuts would eliminate many school sports and Advanced Placement classes, and lay off about 46 teachers. The walkout began at Encinal High where students marched to the Alameda Unified School District (AUSD) offices located on the Alameda High campus, where the 1,000 Encinal students were joined by many more students from Alameda High. After about a half-hour of chanting protests outside the District offices, AUSD superintendent Ardella Dailey invited the walking out students into the Kofman Auditorium to try to explain why the cuts were required.Student Walkout In Alameda Over Budget Cuts , March 5, 2008 Text messaging technology, as well as social networking sites, such as MySpace, Facebook, and YouTube, helped the students coordinate and announce the walkout. Before they reached the district office, many Encinal students text messaged students at Alameda High. Aware of the walkout only when the Encinal students reached the district office, Alameda High officials were unable to prevent their students from leaving class. They were all marked with cleared absences.

Biography Krasnowolski was born in Marienwerder ( Kwidzyn ), Province of West Prussia. He was the second son of Antoni Krasnowolski (1855-1911), teacher, philologist and translator, and Augusta von Thumen (d. in 1935). Krasnowolski first studied art in Warsaw with Wojciech Gerson (from 1896), then in Krak√≥w at Szko≈Ça Sztuk Piƒôknych with Jacek Malczewski (1898-1900) and with Leon Wycz√≥≈Çkowski (1900/1901). he completed his education by studying in Munich (Germany) (1901‚Äì1902). During an open-air session in the village of Bie≈Ñczyce near Krak√≥w, he met his future wife, Salomea Wiktoria Turbas (1882‚Äì1957), daughter of wealthy peasant family (Grzegorz and Salomea n√©e Biernacik). The family tradition makes the Turbasa family descendants of captive Tatar cavalry. The wedding took place on 5 November 1902 in the Krak√≥w Church of St Nicolas, the wedding reception in the bride's cottage in Bie≈Ñczyce, and gathered the artistic milieu of the city led by Leon Wycz√≥≈Çkowski. Until 1914 the couple lived in a peasant cottage. They had four sons: Franciszek (16 April 1903 ‚Äì 19 April 1944) a talented artist who died of tuberculosis; Kazimierz Krasnowolski (teacher and biologist); Witold - the family's adventurer who emigrated to Brazil where for a time he presided over the Union of Poles (ZwiƒÖzek Polak√≥w), tried his hand in coffee planting and opening bus lines, and raised nine children (own and adopted); and W≈Çodzimierz (29 December 1912 ‚Äì 20 December 1981), a soldier of the Home Army (AK) in the Second World War, when he was made to hide under Stalinist terrorism. Krasnowolski joined well-known artistic organisations in Krak√≥w, Warsaw, and Vienna, and his works were included in an album of Polish art published in Paris in 1912. He also published a series of post-cards in order to provide additional income. World War I greatly impacted the Polish art market; forced to teach drawing in secondary school and to work for the Polish Telegraphic Agency, he was troubled by poor health. Despite glaucoma and partial paralysis in his hands (beginning in 1926), he continued to paint and to receive awards - the last one in 1934 for \\"Cottage in the Sun\\". He became embittered in his last years, when he was forced to draw on the support of his son Kazimierz, who was a young teacher at that time. Despondent by the outbreak of another war, he died within a few weeks of its outbreak (on 29 November 1939). He was buried at the Rakowice Cemetery. Work Krasnowolski's paintings are dominated by peaceful landscapes with blue-and-rusty striped cottages, portraits of young girls in regional costumes (most often it was his wife who did the modelling), and children - especially his own sons. Beginning in 1903 he regularly participated in exhibitions by Krak√≥w's Towarzystwo Przyjaci√≥≈Ç Sztuk Piƒôknych and Warsaw's Zacheta, Pozna≈Ñ, Lvov (Lviv), and abroad: in Prague, Vienna, Munich, Budapest, Kiev, and Dresden. Highly recognized by the critics and magazines (Tygodnik Ilustrowany, ≈öwiat, Sfinks, and ≈ªycie i Sztuka), he was most praised for the choice of subject and mood. Especially famous are his Peasant Madonnas in a highly Polish style. His most valued works originated during and after the artist's stay in Paris (1909). This was his time of greatest recognition; he participated in exhibitions with the leading artists of the M≈Çoda Polska (Young Poland) movement, and in 1911 was awarded the highest prize at the 1st Exhibition of Sacred Art in Krak√≥w for his \\"Heart of Jesus\\" (today in the altar of the Church in Krzes≈Çawice), and a few days later - for the \\"Four Bathing Boys\\" (portrait of his sons) in Vienna.

The wilayah is in the Western Hajar Mountains, in the south of the Batinah. Rustaq was once the capital of Oman, during the era of Imam Nasir bin Murshid al Ya'arubi. Rustaq Fort, built four centuries prior to the 7th century CE, is an imposing structure built on three levels, containing separate houses, an armoury, a mosque and four towers. The tallest tower stands over high, and has a diameter of . The Hazm Fort is an outstanding example of Omani Islamic architecture and was built in 1711 AD. The fort's roof is built on columns, and contains no wooden supports. Its walls can withstand great impact, at no less than thick at any point. Rustaq is an area of healing warm springs, the most notable being 'Ain al-Kasafa. Its waters runs at and are regarded as a cure for rheumatism and skin diseases due to its sulphur content. There are three popular wadis to visit: Wadi Bani Ghafar, Wadi al-Sahtan and Wadi Bani Auf. In addition, the mountains are pitted with caves such as Al Sanaqha Cave with its own subterranean springs. One of the main occupations in Rustaq is beekeeping. Pure Omani honey is a most sought- after commodity and is of the highest quality. Fruits such as pomegranates, apricots, plums and grapes are grown on the foothills of the Akhdar Mountains and brought to Rustaq for sale. Etymology The name of this town is a derived from the Middle Iranian r≈çstƒÅg, meaning \\"district\\"\\"r≈çstƒÅg\\" in D. N. Mackenzie, Concise Pahlavi Dictionary (also in Baluchi, Persian, Kumzari, etc.), New Iranian rusta, meaning a 'large village.' The term is a cognate to other Indo-European tongues such as Latin, where 'rustica', means the same thing (whence the source for the English term, 'rustic'). History Rustaq Fort During the days of the Sasanian Empire, Al-Rustaq had a Persian marzban (military governor), whom Sasanians in the area would report to. Dibba and Tuwwam, which Oman today shares with the UAE, were taxed by Al-Julanda, who were clients of the Sasanians. Economy Entrance to the old souq =Industries= Industries prospered over the years due to the elementary needs of people Al Rustaq and some other states and regions in Sultanate of Oman. Al Rustaq was made by middle Iranians 40,000 years ago. Omani Halwa is also produced in Rustaq. People come from many places in the time of Eid and other occasions to buy Halwa. Rustaqi Khanjar production has also been done in Rustaq for a very long time. Old men spend hours and hours making Omani codes. Rustaq people have long been known for their care of palm trees and their dates. They have made use of the branches and leaves to build shelter and make baskets. Leather tanning is also one of the industries in Rustaq. People use leather to save water and food, and for making shoes. =Traditional crafts= * Beekeeping: Rustaq people like beekeeping and many of them own more than 1000 cells. * Tabseel: it means boiling dates of a specific type \\"Mabseli\\" in a particular session. * Sheep grazing: many people graze animals especially those who live in Wadies and far away from the down town. * Renewal of guns: Some artisans work in renewal and amendments to the traditional rifles. They upgrade them and add more modifications to improve their functionality. =Traditional arts= * Mashia: it is an introduction to Razhaa. * Razhaa: art for the men, which started competing in raising the swords. * Razfa: known locally as Hebiah. * Azi: comes in the form of song. * Al-Tareq: This is usually art at the Bedouin living in the north of the state. * Al-hmpel: This is usually when the Bedouin art and residents east of the state said when moving from one place to another via camels. =Agricultural products= The state is famous for the cultivation of different types of palm including: Khalas, Zabad, Hilali, Al-Mabsli Obo Soih, Almeznaj, Subaa Al-Aroos and Jabri.

Illustration to the Akbarnama, miniature painting by Nar Singh, ca. 1605 The DabestƒÅn-e MazƒÅheb () \\"School of Religions\\" is a Persian language work that examines and compares South Asian religions and sects of the mid-17th century. The work, whose authorship is uncertain, was probably composed in about 1655 CE. The text's title is also transliterated as DabistƒÅn-i MazƒÅhib , Dabistan-e Madahib, or Dabestan-e Madaheb. The text is best known for its chapter on the Dƒ´n-i IlƒÅhƒ´, the syncretic religion propounded by the Mughal emperor JalƒÅl ud- Dƒ´n Mu·∏•ammad Akbar (\\"Akbar the Great\\") after 1581 and is possibly the most reliable account of the IbƒÅdat KhƒÅna discussions that led up to this.  Authorship  The authorship of Dabestan is debated. David Shea & Anthony Troyer, who edited a critical edition of the text in 1843, attributed its authorship to the 17th century Persian historian Mohsin Fani. However, this 1843 edition slightly flawed since the translators were not well-versed in much of the subject matter. The editors, who were not certain of the identity of the author, believed that he was a Sufi, but the 1993 edition of the Encyclopaedia Iranica suggests that the author was most likely a Zoroastrian. More recently, Rahim Rezazadeh Malek, who edited a critical edition in 1983, has attributed the text's authorship to the 18th century Perso-Indian heresiographer Kay-Khosrow Esfandiyar. Esfandiyar was the son and successor of Azar Kayvan, and may have belonged to a Persian tradition (Sip√°s√≠√°n) that can be considered to be heterodox relative to orthodox Zoroastrianism.  Editions  This work was first printed by Nazar Ashraf in a very accurate edition in movable type at Calcutta in 1809 (an offset reprint of this edition was published by Ali Asghar Mustafawi from Teheran in 1982). A lithographed edition was published by Ibrahim bin Nur Muhammad from Bombay in AH 1292 (1875). In 1877, Munshi Nawal Kishore published another Lithographed edition from Lucknow. The distinguished Persian scholar Francis Gladwin translated the chapter on the Persians into English and published it from Calcutta in 1789. A German version by E. Dalburg from Wurzburg was published in 1809. The chapter on the Raushanyas was translated into English by J. Leyden for the Asiatic Researches, xi, Calcutta. The entire work was translated into English by David Shea and Anthony Troyer under the title, The Dabistan or School of Manners (1843) in three volumes from London.Ali, M. Athar (2008). Mughal India, New Delhi: Oxford University Press, , pp.216-28 The author describes that he spent time in Patna, Kashmir, Lahore, Surat and Srikakulam (Andhra Pradesh). He is perceived to have been a person of great scholarship and curiosity, and extremely open-minded for the context of his time. He mentions numerous interviews with scholars of numerous faiths, which suggests that he was well connected, and so qualified to report on the Dƒ´n-i IlƒÅhƒ´. According to The Jew in the Lotus by Rodger Kamenetz, a Dabistan was commissioned by a Mughal mystic prince, Dara Shikoh. The section on Judaism consists of translations by a Persian Jewish Sufi Muslim convert, Sarmad Kashani, and his Hindu disciple from Sindh.Jews and Judaism at the Court of the Moghul Emperors in Medieval India, Walter J. Fischel, Proceedings of the American Academy for Jewish Research, Vol. 18, (1948 - 1949), pp. 137-177 Walter Fischel notes: An English version of the Dabistan by David Shea (1843) is available at the Digital Library of India IISc. Author's perspective Although the author spent most of life in South Asia, he regarded himself as a Persian. However his perspective of the Hindus, and of other religions was unusually liberal. He writes:DABIST√ÅN, OR SCHOOL OF MANNERS. TRANSLATED FROM THE ORIGINAL PERSIAN, BY DAVID SHEA AND ANTHONY TROYER,1843. :As inconstant fortune had torn away the author from the shores of Persia, and made him the associate of the believers in transmigration and those who addressed their prayers to idols and images and worshipped demons, therefore the tenets held by this most subtle class of reasoners come to be considered next after those of the Parsees. :... According to these sectaries, the worship offered to the forms of Mahadeo and Nar√°yan, and to the statues of the other spiritual beings, is highly to be commended. Strangers to their faith suppose them to look upon the idol as God, which is by no means the case, their belief being as follows: \\"The idol is merely a Kiblah, and they adore under that particular form, the Being who has neither accident nor form.\\" ... : Rai Manuhar Kuchw√°hhah has said: ::\\"O Moslem! if the K√¢bah be the object of thy worship, ::Why dost thou reproach the adorers of idols?\\" He personally met many scholars of different faiths. For example, about the Jains he writes: :The author of this book affirms he has seen a great number of Srivaras Sevada implies a Jain monk of the Shvetambara order, from Sanskrit Shvetapata. and their followers. From them he knew Meher chand, a L√∫n√∫,Lunia means someone belonging to the Lonka Gachchha in the year 1056 of the Hejira (1646 A. D.), in Dot√°rah, which is under the dominion of Jodpur M√°raw√°r, he found also S√≠va rama, a Puj√°ri, in Mirta, which place belongs to Marawar, and one named Jagna, a Banian, in R√°wel Pandi: he was adorned with all the good qualities of Jatis. When he saw a bird in the hands of a fowler, he bought it of him and set it free. This sect do whatever they can for the liberation of living beings. :Hafiz Shir√°zi says: ::\\"Avoid hurting any living animal, and do whatever thou likest, ::For in my book of laws there is no crime but this.\\" \\"Parsis of Bombay\\" with traditional Parsi hats, a wood engraving, ca. 1878 He observes that while Hindus dress following their own custom, the non-Muslims of Iran and Turan pass themselves off as Muslims, while practicing their faith in secret: :... there are Samrad√≠√°n, Khodan√≠√°n, Radi√°n, Sh√≠derang√≠√°n, P√¢iker√≠√°n, M√≠l√°n√≠an, Al√°r√≠√°n, Sh√≠d√°b√≠√°n, Akhsh√≠an, and Mazdak√≠an, who are dispersed in Iran and Turan, and all appear in the dress of Musulmans, although in secret they follow each the path of their own chosen faith; in the same manner various sects are also established in Hindostan, but they do not appear in the dress of Musulmans. He describes the disputations in Akbar's Ibadat Khana in detail, as if he had been there: :A learned philosopher came into the hall, where Hindus also were present, and three other learned men; a Musulman, a Nazarene, and a Jew: these were summoned, and ranged in opposition to the learned philosopher. The latter opened the discussion in this manner: \\"The divine mission of your prophets has not been proved, for several reasons: the first is, that whatever the prophet says ought to be conformable to reason; the second is, that he ought to be free from crime, and not hurtful to other beings. But Moses, according to the opinion of the Jews, was brought up by Phar√¢oh, and yet he caused him by a stratagem to be drowned in the waters of the Nile,... Jesus permitted the killing and ill using of animals. And Muhammed himself attacked the forces and caravans of the Koreish; he shed blood, nay, with his own hand put to death animated beings. :... Now the Christian said: \\"The Messiah was born without a father.\\" The doctor replied: \\"You yourselves say that Joseph, the carpenter, had taken Mary to wife; how can it be made out that Jesus was not the son of Joseph?\\" The Nazarene was reduced to silence. He describes and defends the liberal views of Akbar: :His Majesty, Akbar, as he was ordered by God, used to read prayers, containing the praise of the sun, in the Persian, Hindi, Turkish, and Arabic languages, among which all was one prayer, which is proper to the Hindus, and which they sing at midnight and at sun-rise. Besides, the emperor forbade his subjects to kill cows and to eat their flesh; .... The Hindus say also that, as many advantages are derived from the cow, it is not right to kill it. The Yezd√°nian maintained that it is tyranny to kill harmless animals ... Outline The text is divided into twelve ta‚Äòlims (chapters): * Chapter I.

He was the first full-time professor of dramatic literature at an American university and played a significant role in establishing theater as a subject worthy of formal study in the academic world. His interests ranged from Shakespeare, Moli√®re, and Ibsen to French boulevard comedies, folk theater, and the new realism of his own day. Biography Matthews born to a wealthy family in New Orleans, grew up in New York City, and graduated from Columbia College in 1871, where he was a member of the Philolexian Society and the fraternity of Delta Psi, and from Columbia Law School in 1873. He had no real interest in the law, never needed to work for a living (given his family fortune),Matthews' father went bankrupt and the family fortune was lost, but his mother's money provided him with a comfortable living and eventually his own books sold quite well. Biographical information from this entry is taken from Matthews' autobiography. and turned to a literary career, publishing in the 1880s and 1890s short stories, novels, plays, books about drama, biographies of actors, and three books of sketches of city life. One of these, Vignettes of Manhattan (1894), was dedicated to his friend Theodore Roosevelt. From 1892 to 1900, he was a professor of literature at Columbia and thereafter held the Chair of Dramatic Literature until his retirement in 1924. He was known as an engaging lecturer and a charismatic if demanding teacher. His influence was such that a popular pun claimed that an entire generation had been \\"brandered by the same Matthews.\\" During his long tenure at Columbia, Matthews created and curated a \\"dramatic museum\\" of costumes, scripts, props, and other stage memorabilia. Originally housed in a four-room complex in Philosophy Hall, the collection was broken up and sold after his death. However, its books were incorporated into the university library and its dioramas of the Globe Theatre and other historic dramatic venues have been dispersed for public display around campus, mainly in Dodge Hall. Matthews was the inspiration for the now-destroyed Brander Matthews Theater on 117th Street, between Amsterdam Avenue and Morningside Drive. An English professorship in his name still exists at Columbia. Teaching Matthews' students knew him as a man well-versed in the history of drama and as knowledgeable about continental dramatists as he was about American and British playwrights. Long before they were fashionable, he championed playwrights who were regarded as too bold for American tastes, such as Hermann Sudermann, Arthur Pinero, and preeminently Henrik Ibsen, about whom he wrote frequently and eloquently. His students also knew him as an opinionated man with a somewhat conservative political bent. Playwright S.N. Behrman, who studied with him in 1917, recalled in his memoirs, \\"One day I made the mistake of bringing into class a copy of [the liberal magazine] The New Republic. I had, actually, a contribution in it. Matthews looked at The New Republic and said, 'I am sorry to see you wasting your time on that stuff.' As a staunch Republican and intimate of Theodore Roosevelt's, he had his duty to do.\\" He could also be \\"easy and anecdotal,\\" Behrman acknowledged, and he was respected on campus as a man-of-the-world.S.N. Behrman, People in a Diary (Boston: Little, Brown, 1972). p. 8. He lived for the theater and made clear his belief that theater was a performance art, first and foremost, and that plays as literary texts should never be viewed in the same light. Yet in the classroom he was an exacting guide to stage craftsmanship. Brander Matthews. Other students recalled him as a teacher who elicited \\"mingled affection and impatience\\"Green, p. 84. and who conducted himself in a manner that never attempted to hide his privileged background, connections, and connoisseurship. His relations with Columbia colleagues were sometimes adversarial. His conservatism became more pronounced in his later years: he was adamant about not admitting women to his graduate coursesGreen, p. 49. and publicly expressed the opinion that women did not have the natural ability to be great playwrights.Brander Matthews, A Book About the Theater (New York: Scribner, 1916), pp. 113-125. According to Mark Van Doren, he taught an \\"ancient\\" American literature elective that he refused to revise over the decades. Not surprisingly, he was a natural target for the World War I-era generation of writers and activists. Reviewing Matthews' autobiography in 1917, the radical critic and fellow Columbia graduate Randolph Bourne complained that for Matthews, \\"literature was a gesture of gentility and not a comprehension of life.\\"Thomas Bender, New York Intellect (New York: Knopf, 1987), p. 232. In On Native Grounds, Alfred Kazin characterized him as a \\"literary gentleman.\\"Alfred Kazin, On Native Grounds (New York: Harcourt, 1942), p. 61. Matthews taught a number of students who went on to have major careers in the theater, including playwright Behrman and drama critics Stark Young, Ludwig Lewisohn, and . Writing Brander Matthews was a prolific, varied, and uneven writer, author of over thirty books. His own novels and plays are undistinguished and long-forgotten (the claim to fame of one of his plays is its footnote status in Theodore Dreiser's novel Sister Carrie: it is the melodrama, A Gold Mine, Carrie attends which leads her to consider a career on the stage). Some of his surveys of American literature and drama sold very well as high-school and college texts. Yet one of his earliest books, French Dramatists of the Nineteenth Century (1881), is an excellent scholarly study of the subject and was revised and reprinted twice over two decades, while his 1919 autobiography, These Many Years, is a deftly-told story of an education in the arts by a man who lived a rich and productive life. It also offers an interesting evocation of life in Manhattan c. 1860-1900. Matthews published a biography of Moli√®re in 1910 and a biography of Shakespeare in 1913. Other activities Matthews had an active professional life off-campus. He was one of the founders of the Authors' Club and the Players' Club and was one of the organizers of the American Copyright League. He was a member of the American Academy of Arts and Letters and president of the National Institute of Arts and Letters in 1913. In 1906, he was named the first chairman of the Simplified Spelling Board and served as president of the Modern Language Association of America in 1910. In 1907, the French government decorated him with the Legion of Honor for his services in promoting the cause of French drama. Professional and personal friendships Brander Matthews was not a typical academic for his time. He was friends with many notable men, e.g. Robert Louis Stevenson, Rudyard Kipling, Bret Harte, Mark Twain, William Dean Howells, and Theodore Roosevelt.Green, p. 83. His relationship with TwainMatthews wrote the Introduction to the New York edition of Twain's Collected Works. had a bantering quality (Twain, in his famous essay \\"Fenimore Cooper's Literary Offenses,\\" lambastes Matthews' statements concerning Cooper's literary merits), while his friendship with Howells was earnest and supportive. Matthews' correspondence with Roosevelt, which extended from the 1880s through the White House years, was posthumously published. They shared a temperamental affinity as well as an interest in the cause of simplified spelling.Nathan Miller, Theodore Roosevelt: A Life (New York: William Morrow, 1992), PP. 422-423. Despite his complacent persona in later years, wearing mutton-chop whiskers long after that style has passed, Matthews was always an intensely social man. He regularly invited students to his West End apartment for evenings of conversation. In the 1890s he was a charter member of an informal group called \\"the Friendly Sons of Saint Bacchus,\\" which met in a bohemian cafe in Greenwich Village for entertainment and readings. Other members of the group included the erudite and cosmopolitan critic James Gibbons Huneker and the rowdy Ash can painter George Luks, two New Yorkers notorious for their hard drinking, whose presence would suggest that the \\"sons\\" were not devoted to purely intellectual pastimes.Arnold Schwab, James Gibbons Huneker: Critic of the Seven Arts (Berkeley: Stanford University Press, 1963), p. 113. Huneker shared Matthews' desire to see drama accepted as a subject for serious criticism and, like his academic friend, lobbied for more attention to be paid by American audiences to the advanced European dramatists.Schwab, p. 151. The two had crossed paths in Europe when Matthews was doing research for his first book, The Theatres of Paris (1880). Matthews was also a member of the long-running Gin Mill Club, a more exclusive informal organization whose members included the university's president, Nicholas Murray Butler, and numerous public officials equally devoted to fraternal evenings of conversation, good wine, and good food.Michael Rosenthal, Nicholas Miraculous: The Amazing Career of the Redoubtable Dr. Nicholas Murray Butler (New York: Farrar, Straus, Giroux, 2006), p. 262, . Brander Matthews retired from Columbia University at the age of seventy-two. He was predeceased by both his wife, Ada Harland, an actress who had given up her career when they married, and their only child, a daughter. He died in New York City five years after his retirement, in 1929.

History  Theodor August Heintzman, founder of Heintzman & Co. The firm was incorporated in 1866 in Toronto, Ontario by Theodor August Heintzman, who was born in Berlin, May 19, 1817, and who emigrated to Canada in 1860, following a brief residence in New York City. The story that Heintzman worked in the same Berlin piano factory as (and emigrated from Germany with) Henry E. Steinway, who went on to found Steinway & Sons, is unconfirmed, but is typical of comparisons that were often later made between the instruments that their two firms produced. Following his arrival in Toronto, Heintzman began to produce pianos from his residence (he is said to have worked initially from his kitchen) and then went on to open his first factory at 23 Duke Street. By May 1868 Heintzman had relocated operations to 105 King St W and was soon turning out more than 60 pianos a year. By 1873 the company had moved to 115-17 King St W where there was space for a factory, offices, and sales rooms. The company was operated by Theodore Heintzman until his death in 1899, when his sons took over operation of the company. The organisation continued to grow throughout the 1870s, and by 1879 had turned out its thousandth instrument. By 1884 the number of pianos completed reached nearly 2000, and a new factory was built in the West Toronto suburb of Toronto. (Heintzman Street marks the location of the factory today.) All production was moved to the new factory in 1888 and output began to climb steeply. Theodore Heintzman's nephew, Gerhard Heintzman, was also a piano maker, and when Gerhard died in 1926, Heintzman & Co. continued to operate Gerhard company for several years. In later years they also produced pianos under the Gerhard Heintzman brand. In the 1920s, when many Canadian piano manufacturers were struggling, Heintzman & Co. also took over the Nordheimer Piano Company, and in later years produced pianos under the Nordheimer name. Heintzman & Co. also produced foot-pumped player pianos although a number of electric pianos have been found to use the Welte reproducing system as well as two surviving examples of an ArtEcho reproducing system. Over the years, Heintzman produced pianos were sold under several brands names, and Heintzman also sold pianos produced for them by other piano manufacturers. Heintzman's top pianos were produced under the \\"Heintzman & Company\\" brand, with the \\"Gerhard Heintzman\\" brand being next, then the \\"Nordheimer\\" brand (acquired from Albert Nordheimer, a nephew of Samuel Nordheimer in 1927).Nordheimer at \\"Synagogue Memmelsdorf\\" Brands that were produced for them, and sold with a \\"From Heintzman & Company\\" decal were Gerhard, Weber, Stevenson. Unlike some piano manufacturers of the time, Heintzman always aimed to produce high- quality, rather than affordable instruments, and it was on the basis of this reputation that the firm carried its success into the twentieth century. Heintzman suffered considerably during the Great Depression of the 1930s, but continued to manufacture pianos in the decades that followed, reaching production of 5000 instruments in 1967. Heintzman had opened an additional factory in Hanover, Ontario in 1962, and following a merger in 1978 with the Sherlock-Manning Piano Co, relocated their head offices there as Heintzman Ltd. The new company continued to produce pianos under both names, with the Heintzman grand piano the top line. In January 1981, Heintzman Ltd was sold by the family to Sklar-Peppler Inc. of Hanover, Ontario, and was operated by Sklar-Peppler as a subsidiary under the Heintzman Ltd. name. It redesigned, rescaled and re-engineered both upright and grand pianos, and by 1985, 750 uprights and 40-50 grands were produced annually. People say that pianos of this era are popularly considered to be of substantially lower quality than earlier instruments, though still good compared to pianos manufactured around the world today, even in Germany. They made good furniture pieces and were hand made out of Canadian wood by the same people in Heintzman. In 1986 The Music Stand, an Oakville-based franchise music retail chain, purchased the Heintzman Ltd. patents and trademarks from Sklar-Peppler, as well as the remaining inventory, which it marketed. In 1990, a Federal Court judge ruled that The Music Stand could not place the Heintzman nameplate on pianos built in South Korea and the US, which it imported for sale in Canada.  Today  The current \\"Heintzman Piano Company\\" was established in August 1989 as a joint venture between the Beijing HsingHai Piano Group and Canadian shareholders. This company bought the manufacturing equipment and scale designs from the Canadian factory, which are still used in current-production pianos. James Moffat, the Canadian plant manager, was retained as a consultant and continues to visit the Chinese factory several times each year. In 1995, when the Chinese government began allowing foreign control of manufacturing companies, the Canadian shareholders bought out controlling shares in the company. Heintzman grands use soundboards from Canadian manufacturer Andre Bolduc.  Characteristics  1914 Heintzman upright piano According to one piano technician, Heintzman & Co. \\"produced uncompromised quality grand and upright pianos through the early decades of the twentieth century. Unfortunately, the market for large uprights declined through the 1930s. Heintzman followed the trend toward smaller cheaper uprights and although they produced better than average uprights, they couldn't match the sound and quality of the earlier full sized upright pianos that they had once produced.\\" See also * Heintzman House  References   External links  * Heintzman & Co. at the Canadian Encyclopedia * Heintzman Distributors Limited * 1967 Article on Heintzman & Company in \\"Industrial Canada\\" * Heintzman & Company - PianoTech article * Canadian Piano Manufacturers G-M * Heintzman Pianos Limited Category:Canadian companies established in 1866 Category:Defunct manufacturing companies of Canada Category:Manufacturing companies based in Toronto Category:Piano manufacturing companies Category:1866 establishments in Ontario Category:Musical instrument manufacturing companies of Canada ","title":"Heintzman &amp; Co."},{"id":"3888130","text":"Saint-Marc () is a commune in western Haiti in Artibonite. Its geographic coordinates are . At the 2003 Census the commune had 160,181 inhabitants. It is one of the biggest cities, second to Gona√Øve, between Port-au-Prince and Cap-Ha√Øtien. The port of Saint-Marc is currently the preferred port of entry for consumer goods coming into Haiti. Reasons for this may include its location away from volatile and congested Port-au-Prince as well as its central location relative to a large group of Haitian cities including Cap- Ha√Øtien, Carrefour, Delmas, Fort-Libert√©, Gona√Øves, Hinche, Limbe, P√©tion- Ville, Port-de-Paix, and Verrettes. These cities, together with their surrounding areas, contain nearly eight million of Haiti's ten million people (2009). In 1905 the Compagnie Nationale or National Railroad built a 100 km railroad north to Saint-Marc from the national capital of Port-au-Prince. The track was later extended another 30 km east to Verrettes.  Overview  St. Marc is a large port town surrounded by mountains. At all times, there are many boats in the port, typically sail boats. The town was first settled in 1716, then located in the French colony of Saint-Domingue. The town is located on flat land close to the sea but its edges extend into the foothills. From these vantage points, the ocean is sometimes viewable. The city has a few park spaces, including Place Cite Nissage Saget. These parks are often surrounded by vendors with carts full of goods. Local residents enjoy the rich culture of St. Marc and it is considered a safe place to live. About 60% of the population lives in the communal section, meaning outside of town. As a result, they are beyond its infrastructure and lack drainage systems, electricity and potable water. Recent development projects have been underway in St. Marc, with assistance and funding from USAID and IOM. They include: grading and paving roads, implementing a sewage/drainage system and providing access to potable water at various points throughout the larger town. In addition, a USAID project trained youth to map the town on OpenStreetMap, a free, editable online map.  Transportation  The way to get from the capital of Port-au-Prince through St. Marc is by means of Route Nationale # 1 (Haiti Highway 1), which extends all the way up to the coastal towns of Montrouis and Gona√Øves, before reaching its terminus at the northern port of Cap-Ha√Øtien. The most prevalent mode of transportation is the motorcycle (mobylette), due to the inexpensive maintenance and low gas consumption. Generally, people fit as many as four on a bike even though the mobylettes are designed for a maximum of two people. Bikes are another common source of transport. Cars are considered a luxury mode of transportation. St. Marc is known for being a blend of city and rural lifestyles. For many living in Port- au-Prince, it is considered the start of the ‚Äúcountry‚Äù. Goats are rampant and can be seen roaming about the city streets. Many people in St. Marc also own cows or chickens.  Culture  = People = Haitians are a very hospitable and welcoming population, including those in St. Marc. It is said here that ‚ÄúBonjou is the passport‚Äù, meaning that saying hello opens doors. Every time you see someone you know or have just met, you must say either ‚Äúbonjou or bonswa‚Äù, literally meaning ‚Äògood morning‚Äô or ‚Äògood evening‚Äô. Typically the person who enters a room makes the greeting. Although St. Marc is known as the ‚Äúpleasure city‚Äù as many young people reside here; the majority of people live in abject poverty and work extremely hard to make ends meet. Haitians tend to have a style of talking with powerful projection. Visitors sometimes perceive them to be angry when they are having ordinary exchanges. People in St. Marc enjoy exchanging jokes with each other. Comedy is a favorite pastime. = Music = There are three main types of music listened to in St. Marc: *Troubadou or twoubadou is very similar to Salsa music and includes drums, trumpets, and guitar. *Haitian folk music is strongly associated with Vodou. It is often played as processional music in the streets between Ash Wednesday and Easter Sunday. In St. Marc, many people also listen to popular American music. Popular Haitian groups have developed over the years, such as Les Formidables. This group is no longer together as most members live overseas, but the group‚Äôs music lingers in the culture. Virtuose is a very popular group in St. Marc. BC and Gwoup 703 are other popular Haitian groups. RapCreole is an emerging popular style among the youth. Typically this kind of rap uses rhythms typical of Haitian folk or popular music. Popular ‚ÄòRapKreyol‚Äô artists include BC (Barikad Crew), Skwardy, Izolan, Fantom. Sebastien Pierre is a popular R&B; artist. Zom√≤ is one of the most popular singer at Saint-Marc. In 2014, he featured in a music called Lifes goes on which was one of the best in Haiti.http://lenouvelliste.com/lenouvelliste/article/140329/AZ-les-voix-de- Life-goes-on = Food = Dous Makos (Haitian Fudge) Food plays a large role in the life of people in St. Marc. Meals are an important part of normal daily social interaction. For the most part, cooking is done outside to avoid overheating and moisture collection inside. Plantains, rice or pasta are staples of almost every meal. Seafood is also consumed regularly. For instance, crab, dried cod and fresh fish are available. Goat is perhaps the most common meat, but chicken and beef are also consumed regularly. Haitians have an affinity for either very spicy food (even peanut butter is spicy) or very sweet food (sugar is added to sugary cereals). Spices and spicy peppers are used abundantly in Haitian cuisine. A significant amount of produce is grown locally, specifically bananas, plantains, mangoes, cherries, corn, manioc, rice, and tomatoes. The typical St. Marc resident consumes a lot of fruit. A dish very specific to St. Marc consists of rice with sauce ‚Äúpois‚Äù (beans), crab/goat meat mixed in, or both. Other dishes include bananne pesse (fried plaintains) which are accompanied with piklese, a spicy ‚Äúgardiniera‚Äù mixture that consists of carrots, cabbage, and peppers. Soup is typically prepared on Sunday to make use of all the week's leftovers. It usually consists of several types of meat, potatoes, and carrots. Fresh fish, typically sole, is also consumed regularly. This fish is cooked over an open fire with a mayonnaise-based marinade mixed with various spices. Riz du let is a common dessert, essentially a rice pudding made with cinnamon, milk, sugar, and butter. Other Creole-named desserts include dous makos (Haitian fudge), dous kokoye (homemade coconut candy), pen patat (sweet potato bread), pen diri (rice bread), etc. = Religion = Religious believers follow mostly Catholicism and Haitian Vodou. Both are prevalent throughout the country. Catholicism/Christianity is the most widespread and generally accepted religion in St. Marc. Most Haitians attend church on Sundays. Roman Catholicism was brought by the French colonists who settled Saint-Domingue; missionary priests and others worked to convert enslaved Africans. Some 60% of Haitians are practicing Catholics, sometimes combining it with elements of Vodou. Evangelical Protestants and Baptist churches are also very common in St. Marc. The majority of residents are very involved in their church as centers of community and cultural identity. On any given day, groups of people singing hymns can also be heard throughout the streets. Vodou developed from combining of the different West African religions brought by slaves; the word Vodou is derived from an African word meaning spirit. It is the most widely practiced and considered the official religion of Haiti. Although a few devout Catholics denounce it, the majority of Haitians practice both religions simultaneously. Catholicism is syncretic and has absorbed elements of Vodou. The latter is often referred to for explaining and treating illness. Vodou is more strongly rooted in the rural areas, and this population is more reluctant to accept Western medicine. = Sports = Saint Marc currently has two soccer teams playing in the Haitian professional football league Ligue Ha√Øtienne. Baltimore Sportif Club and Temp√™te Football Club  Economy  Commerce is the largest trade in St. Marc. Many find work as a merchant, either with their own stand in the market or at a boutique ‚Äúconvenient store‚Äù stand. There are also a multitude of street sellers who carry baskets of goods or candy on their heads, as well as selling canned milk to passers-by. Not many of these products are manufactured in St. Marc. Nearly all products sold are received in the country as donations or surpluses from second-hand stores in the US. St. Marc markets are open daily, featuring almost any type of fruit or vegetable grown locally. St. Marc hosts a charcoal market for cooking material. As charcoal is used for much of the cooking in St. Marc and throughout Haiti in general, it is manufactured locally and supports a large work force. The island has become deforested from so much wood being taken from the forests. Aside from the charcoal market, St. Marc‚Äôs economics revolve a great deal around agricultural products produced in the area. In Deye Legliz, an area near St. Marc harbor, food markets are open daily. Most residents shop on Saturday to stock up on food supplies for the week. The Boulevard area houses a large flea market, with a variety of mostly second- hand items sold, including clothing, electronic equipment, shoes, toys, bicycles, etc. Many people from Port-au-Prince come to the markets in St. Marc because of the inexpensive costs. = Shopping = Retail bricks and mortar (or wooden) stores also exist in St. Marc. These include: pharmacies that sell medicinal products, open-air markets (march√©) that sell food and many other types of goods, bakeries with wheat and cassava bread and various sweet baked goods, convenience stores, and magazins or specialty shops for such items as fabric, hardware, beauty salons and car parts.  Demographics  According to ARCHIVE Research: In general, people from St. Marc are classified as a Middle class and a Lower Class (the poverty class). The former is generally literate in French, while the latter use Creole and may not be literate. Many of the better schools teach both French and English as formal languages, resulting in children gaining fluency in those and Creole, their first language. Residents aspire to having a concrete masonry house (CMU), associated with security and wealth. Middle-class families may also wish to save enough money to emigrate with their children from the struggling country. Some observers think the struggle for survival for most families works against joint goals for the city and nation. Attractions  Going to the beach is a popular activity for families and friends on the weekend. The most popular time to go is on Sunday after church. The most important beaches in St. Marc are Grosse Roche and Amani-y. Grosse Roche Beach in Saint-Marc, Haiti Amani-y beach is a white sandy beach. It was abandoned for more than 25 years before being acquired by the current developer. It is the site of a noted \\"Zombie hole\\", a 200-meters- deep reef that features large \\"Elephant Ears\\" fan coral, sponge tubes, black coral, blue tang, sea urchins, and many more. Near the beach are some of the region's noted historical sites, such as: the Palace with 365 doors and 52 windows in Petite Rivi√®re de l'Artibonite; the forts in Marchand Dessalines; the pilgrimage site of Saut d‚ÄôEau; and the port of Saint-Marc.

Having shorter runways than the city's bigger Keflav√≠k International Airport, which is sited out of town, it only serves internal flights within Iceland and to Greenland, small international charters, transatlantic ferry flights and private flights. It can also serve as alternate airport for flights inbound towards Keflav√≠k, in case of adverse weather conditions there. To distinguish from the larger Keflav√≠k International Airport outside Reykjav√≠k, it is sometimes unofficially in English called Reykjavik City Airport (also by the airport administration),Reykjavik City Airport and also Reykjavik Domestic Airport,Car Rental in Reykjavik Domestic Airport but also Reykjav√≠k international AirportReykjavik International Airport Live Arrivals because it has some international flights but mostly domestic ones. Reykjav√≠k Airport is the main hub of Air Iceland Connect and Eagle Air. Of the airport's three runways, two are currently active all-year round. The shortest runway, 06/24, is usually used only in winter, and takeoffs from 06 (northeast direction) are forbidden because of safety and noise. Reykjav√≠k Airport is owned and operated by the state enterprise Isavia. History Hawker Hurricane aircraft at RAF Reykjavik during World War II The first flight from the airport area was 3 September 1919, with the takeoff of an Avro 504, the first aeroplane in Iceland. Until 1937, there were experiments with airline operations in Vatnsm√Ωri, but with the foundation of Iceland's oldest airline, Flugf√©lag Akureyrar (now Icelandair) in Akureyri in 1938, operations began in the area and in March 1940 scheduled flights started when Flugf√©lag Akureyrar moved its hub from Akureyri to Reykjav√≠k (and changed its name to Flugf√©lag √çslands). The current airport was built by the British Army during World War II on the south coast of the Reykjav√≠k peninsula. Construction began in October 1940, when the airport had only a grass surface. The Black Watch regiment built the first runway, constructing it over sunken oil barrels. The British Royal Air Force operated from the airport, then named RAF Reykjavik, from March 1941. On 6 July 1946, the British handed the airport operation over to the Icelandic government and since then it has been operated by the Icelandic Civil Aviation Authority (now Flugsto√∞ir). Renovation of the airport started in 2000 and lasted two years. This was followed by a referendum in 2001, with 49.3% of the votes for moving the airport out of the city centre, and 48.1% votes for it remaining in place until 2016, when the current urban plan expires. The outcome of these elections on the other hand was not binding because election participation was under 40% and the left wing majority made the decision to have such a clause for it to be binding and beyond that because these elections were not held properly in respect to certain legal technicalities that also resulted in no option for non-election day voting (for vacationers for example). After renovation, the width of runways 01/19 and 13/31 are 45 m and 06/24 is 30m, with visual approach for runways 01 and 31, while runway 19 has ILS CAT I/NBD-DME approach and runway 13 has LLZ- DME/NDB-DME approach. The lights for the runways were updated with LIH Wedge for all runways. 06/24 is currently closed and being used as a taxiway, as of 2020. Future The city has grown around the airport and it is now located in the western part of the city. This location is considered inconvenient by many, for noise and safety reasons and because it takes up a lot of otherwise useful area near downtown areas. There is an ongoing debate about the future of the airport, with the three options being: Leaving the airport as is, demolishing the airport and building a new airport elsewhere in the Reykjav√≠k area or demolishing the airport and moving all flight services to Keflav√≠k. Facilities There are two terminals located on different sides of the runway area: the main terminal () handles both international and domestic traffic for Air Iceland, and a smaller terminal () which serves domestic and international business flights for Eagle Air.  Airlines and destinations  Other facilities Icelandair Group and Icelandair have a head office at the airport.\\"Location .\\" Icelandair Group. Retrieved on 28 December 2009.

It first appeared in New Gods #1 (February 1971). History The Source may be considered the consciousness of the DC Universe, in which it is the non-religious equivalent to Buddha-nature or Purusha or the Presence. It is the source of all that exists. Mostly associated with the New Gods, the Source was the supposed origin of the Godwave that is believed to have been responsible for creating and empowering the \\"Gods\\" of the DC Universe with their divine abilities. It also seems to be partially responsible for the ability of DC residents to develop superpowers, especially those which defy physics. Lying at the edge of the known universe in the Promethean Galaxy is the Source Wall, which protects the Source, and traps all those who attempt to pass beyond it. DC Comics has kept the Source out of the main continuum of its storytelling; therefore, not much is known concretely about its many aspects.New Gods #1 (Feb. 1971) In the Superman- Batman graphic novel Torment (2008), Superman is sent into the Source by Desaad using Highfather's staff to create a boom tube there. Batman later uses the staff to break through the Source Wall. =Death of the New Gods= While investigating the death of the New Gods, Metron encountered the Source. The Source revealed it was behind the deaths to build a new \\"Fifth World.\\" It revealed that the most powerful gods of three pantheons of the Second World‚Äîthe \\"Old Gods\\"‚Äîattacked it and caused it to split into separate beings. The other being evolved into the Anti-Life entity. In retribution, the Source destroyed the Old Gods and created the New Gods. However, its diminished state caused the New Gods to be flawed. The Source sought to reunite with its other half and start anew. It took advantage of the actions of Alexander Luthor and Rip Hunter to create the 52 worlds of the multiverse to ease the reunion. Using its agent, the Infinity Man, to kill the New Gods and store their souls in a second Source Wall and Mister Miracle as the user of the Anti-Life Equation, the Source was able to breach the primary Source Wall and reunited with its Anti-Life other half. With all the New Gods dead but one, the Source traveled to Apokolips to confront the final god, Darkseid, and complete his task. However, Darkseid had devised a method to tap into the power of the souls of the New Gods which were being stored in the second Source Wall, giving him equal footing with the Source, until Superman intervened, allowing the Source to deploy his trump card, Orion, who shared Darkseid's access to this power. While Darkseid and Orion fought, with Orion eventually defeating him, the Source slammed New Genesis and Apokolips together creating a single planet, with one half similar to Apokolips and the other to New Genesis. When this was over, the Source told Superman that his work was done, and that he would be leaving this plane of existence.Death of the New Gods #1-8 (2008) =DC Rebirth= Twenty billion years ago, the Source sent Perpetua to create new systems of life within the greater omniverse. However, while Perpetua complied, she also did it to bring down her masters by creating something meant to live forever. Thus, she created the first Multiverse by using the Seven Hidden Forces of the Universe to be a self-sustaining weapon against her masters and also created her children from the Overvoid, to monitor each realms of matter within her Multiverse. Five billion years later, Perpetua merged the Humans and the Martians with their worlds to create an army of Apex Predator meant to live and fight for eternity in order to prepare herself to go to war against the Judges of the Source. However, her sons alerted the Judges of the Source on her actions and they sent a cosmic raptor to seal her and the Totality of her powers in the Source Wall which the raptor created. In other media *Many have speculated that Star War's \\"force\\" was inspired by the source In Chris Taylor's book How Star Wars Conquered the Universe: The Past, Present, and Future of a Multibillion Dollar Franchise, he notes the similarity between the Source and the Force in George Lucas's Star Wars and suggests Lucas may have been influenced by the comic series. * In the episode \\"Twilight\\", when discussing possible military action against Apokolips, the Highfather says he \\"must commune with the Source\\" before making a decision of such importance. Later, he is shown kneeling in front of a stone wall with flames upon it. In Justice League Unlimited, passage beyond the Source wall could only be survived by a \\"12th level intellect\\". Lex Luthor was able to enter and exit the Source, stating to Metron that he was \\"overqualified\\". Behind the Source wall resided all the secrets to the universe including the Anti-Life Equation sought by Darkseid. * Brother Eye satellite is revealed to be equipped with the latest Source energy scanners to detect fluctuations in the Multiverse allowing it to detect potential crisis on various alternate Earth's in the introductory cutscene for Multiverse mode.

Common egg-eating snake, Dasypeltis scabra, with an egg in its throat. Etymology The specific name, gansi, is in honor of American herpetologist Carl Gans (1923‚Äì2009).Beolens, Bo; Watkins, Michael; Grayson, Michael (2011). The Eponym Dictionary of Reptiles. Baltimore: Johns Hopkins University Press. xiii + 296 pp. . (Dasypeltis gansi, p. 97). Description The species of the genus Dasypeltis exhibit a wide variation in patterning and color, from mixtures of browns and greens, to solid black. Individuals in a specific locality tend to share similar color and pattern. They vary in size greatly, from in total length (including tail). Behavior Dasypeltis species tend to have a nervous disposition, and when threatened will perform what is called saw- scaling, where it will rub its scales together quickly to make a rasping noise that sounds vaguely like hissing. They are agile climbers, and have a keen sense of smell to tell whether an egg is rotten or too far developed to be comfortable to eat. They have extremely flexible jaws and necks for eating eggs much larger than their head, and have no teeth, but they do have bony protrusions on the inside edge of their spine which are used to aid in breaking the shells of eggs. The process of consuming an egg involves wrapping their mouth around it and drawing it into the throat and then flexing their muscles pushing the egg into the bony protrusions on their spine, which causes the egg to collapse in on itself. Then the snake carefully squeezes every last bit of liquid out of the inside of the egg, ending with regurgitation of the completely crushed egg shell. They are remarkably efficient, and waste very little of the contents of an egg. Gallery A sequence of a montane egg- eating snake, Dasypeltis atra, consuming a quail egg: grasping egg, swallowing egg, breaking egg and ingesting contents, regurgitating shell. Image:Dasypeltis_atra2.jpg Image:Dasypeltis_atra3.jpg Image:Dasypeltis_atra4.jpg Image:Dasypeltis_atra5.jpg In captivity Dasypeltis species are readily available in the exotic pet trade, but due to their unique dietary needs they can be a challenge to keep in captivity. Most egg-eating snakes never get large enough to consume typical chicken eggs, so smaller ones must be provided, such as finch or quail eggs. Once a reliable source(s) of food is obtained, Dasypeltis make easy and hardy vivarium species. Captive breeding is virtually unknown, so almost all specimens available are wild caught. Many owners have resorted to force-feeding their Dasypeltis because the animal seems not to be eating. However, evidence has shown that, like large constrictors, these snakes may go for very long periods (months) without eating after a large meal. As long as the snake is behaving normally and does not appear to be in physical distress, force-feeding is not advised. When a specimen seems to be \\"off\\" its food, offering it eggs approximately monthly is appropriate. If the snake does not eat but continues to drink, is active, and sheds, then it does not need to be force-fed.

It is the first station on the Abbey Line, a single-track branch line which runs from to and is located approximately north east of Watford Junction. It is adjacent to a level crossing where the Abbey Line crosses Bushey Mill Lane. Watford North is one of three railway stations in the central Watford area and is operated as an unstaffed railway halt. The Abbey Line service is known locally as the \\"Abbey Flyer\\". History The branch line to St Albans was opened in 1858 by the London and North Western Railway (LNWR). Watford North station opened 52 years later, in October 1910. Originally named Callowland, the station was built to serve a developing residential and industrial area which still thrives today. It was renamed Watford North in 1927. After the nationalisation of Britain's railways in 1948, the line was run by British Rail (from 1986 under its Network SouthEast brand). As passenger and goods usage dwindled in the 1950s and 60s, the stations on the line were downgraded to unmanned halts. In 1963, Watford North and the Abbey line were threatened with closure as part of the Beeching cuts, but the line was kept in service. In 1995, a proposal was made to run a reduced service on the Abbey line with diesel trains instead of electric trains. An advocacy group, known as Abfly, was formed to campaign for the line to be maintained and continues to lobby for improvements to the service today. After the Privatisation of British Rail the franchise for the Abbey Line was taken over by National Express who ran the line under its Silverlink Metro name until November 2007, when Govia, operating as London Midland, took over the franchise. The Community Rail Partnership for the Abbey Line, established in 2005, works to improve the Abbey Line and inspects stations such as Watford North at least once a week.

The railway is the quickest way to get between Watford and St Albans, taking only 16 minutes. Future A number of possible changes to the line have been proposed, including new means of buying tickets, and the restoration of a passing loop at Bricket Wood, which would facilitate a 30-minute service. Plans were announced in October 2009 for the line to be converted to light rail. The line and stations were to be leased to Hertfordshire County Council who would run a tram-train service from Watford Junction to . Longer-term proposals envisaged extension into St Albans city centre, possibly to St Albans City railway station. It was estimated that the tram line would be in operation by 2012, but the project was cancelled due to the complications and expense of transferring the line from National Rail to the county council. For the foreseeable future, Watford North will continue to be served by heavy rail trains.

It is the seventh novel to feature the mysterious Albert Campion, aided by his grouchy manservant Magersfontein Lugg. Plot introduction The story starts in 1911 with the mysterious disappearance of one of the members of the Barnabas family, owners of a leading publishing house in London. After the initial investigation, the mystery soon disappears from the public's mind, and the remaining cousins continue the family business. Twenty years later, another member of the same family has also gone missing, and Albert Campion, a friend of the family, is brought in to find the wayward cousin. This time, the missing cousin shows up dead. The obvious suspect is the youngest of the Barnabas cousins, who also happens to love the dead man's wife. Campion must delve deep into the Barnabas family history to find the real murderer, but finds much more than he expected. Plot summary The Barnabas family is no stranger to mystery, one of the founder's nephews, Tom Barnabas, having disappeared from the street in broad daylight never to be seen again. When it is remarked, at a Sunday evening gathering held by Gina Brande in her flat next door to the offices, that Paul Brande, her inattentive husband, has not been home for three days, no-one finds it too remarkable. Shortly after the arrival of his old friend Albert Campion to look into the vanishing, Paul's younger cousin Mike, in love with Gina, goes to the vault to fetch some papers for the eldest cousin, the Barnabas Managing Director John Widdowson, and returns looking shaken, but saying nothing. Next morning, Paul's body is found sprawled in plain view in front of the vault. The doctor who is called immediately recognizes that Paul has been dead for several days, and a decision is made to move the body from where it was found, destroying clues. Mike is sent to inform Mrs Brande and seen comforting her tenderly. Campion investigates the scene of the crime and finds a recently broken ventilator to the rear of the vault, which leads to a next-door garage. Questioning staff, he discovers that the position of the body made it impossible for Mike to have missed him the night before. The police find a length of rubber pipe stained with soot. At the inquest, the doctors and police reveal that Paul was killed by carbon monoxide inhalation, the pipe having been used to connect the exhaust of Mike's car to the vault ventilator. A neighbor testifies she heard the car running in the garage from six to nine on the night Paul disappeared. Mike says he was out walking the streets until eight, and that around nine had started the car to warm it up by running the engine for a few minutes before going for a drive. Gina's housekeeper speculates too freely about her mistress's relationship with Mike, and at the end of the inquest Mike is arrested for the murder. Campion befriends Ritchie, an odd and rather awkward cousin - the brother of the vanished Tom, and with his help questions Miss Netley, Paul's suspicious secretary. He tracks down Paul's mistress, but finds she knows nothing, except that he missed an appointment with her on the night he died. He learns of a valuable unpublished manuscript of a play by William Congreve owned by the firm and regarded as a financial asset, which Paul had hoped to display, and of a visit Paul paid to a London district on business concerning a key. From his manservant Lugg, he learns that a renowned underground key copier lives in the area mentioned, and together they investigate, Lugg's criminal past helping to persuade the man to help by providing a copy of the key he made for Paul. Campion visits the Barnabas offices with Ritchie's help and finds someone in the vault. They fight, and Campion subdues the man, who turns out to be the accountant, Rigget. Rigget confesses to having made a copy of the vault key and sneaking in at night to look for any valuable information. On the night after Paul's death, he had also entered the room and found Paul curled up and dead in a corner, and the vault unlocked; he locked it using Paul's key. He also took the vault key from inside the door, locked it on the outside when he left, returning the key to its normal place. The trial begins the next day, and Campion, exhausted from his long night, attends. Things look bleak for Mike, but Campion has found out from an uncle working at the British Museum that the document in the vault is not the original manuscript. He visits John Widdowson's flat with Ritchie, looks around, questions the maid, and leaves a note for Widdowson enclosing a page from the facsimile manuscript. Widdowson calls him later, agrees that the manuscript he found was a facsimile, but that the original is safe in one of the firm's other offices, telling him to confirm the fact by opening a certain locked cupboard. Campion goes there, still weary from a lack of sleep, and almost hurls himself at the jammed door to force it open. Becoming suspicious, he kicks it instead, and discovers it leads outside to a terrible drop. He realizes that he too was to be killed by Widdowson for the same reason he killed Brande, to prevent exposure that the play, which is the company's financial asset, is not an original. During the court proceedings against Mike on the next day, the case is suddenly called off. Widdowson has been found in his bath, an apparent suicide caused by carbon monoxide fumes from a gas water-heater. Campion learns that the windows had been were wedged shut from the outside, that the heater had been manipulated, and that Ritchie has vanished. Later, holidaying in France with Mike, Campion finds the long lost Tom Barnabas, alias Pierre Robert, who tells him that instead of his legacy he had taken the original manuscript to buy a circus, in which Campion sees Ritchie performing, now finally in his element as a clown. Campion realizes that Ritchie's quietly avenging the murder of Paul by killing Widdowson gave him the role of \\"the king's executioner.\\" Characters in Flowers for the Judge * John Widdowson, head of the Barnabas publishing company, and nephew of the founder * Paul Brande, another Barnabas nephew, also employed by the company * Gina Brande, Paul's attractive but neglected American wife * Mrs Austin, their maid, a kindly but tactless woman * Mike Wedgwood, the youngest of the nephews, a junior partner in the firm * Albert Campion, an old friend of Mike, an adventurer, detective and universal uncle * Magersfontein Lugg, Campion's manservant, a temperamental ex-burglar * Ritchie Barnabas, an apparently simple nephew employed in minor duties, a long-armed man * Tom Barnabas, the long-missing brother of Ritchie, thought to have vanished into thin air * Miss Florence Curley, an efficient lady, long employed by the Barnabases * Peter Rigget, an accountant with the firm, a stocky and sneaky man * Mr Scruby, the family's lawyer * Alexander Barnabas, a famously dramatic barrister, son of the founder of the company Film, TV or theatrical adaptations The story was adapted for television by the BBC, the seventh of eight Campion stories starring Peter Davison as Campion and Brian Glover as Lugg.

The cars are approximately one-quarter (1/4) the size of a full-size midget car. The adult-size midget being raced during the start of quarter midget racing used an oval track of one-fifth of a mile in length. The child's quarter midget track is one quarter that length, or 1/20th mile (264 feet). An adult-size midget in the 1940s and 1980s could reach 120 miles per hour, while the single-cylinder 7-cubic-inch quarter midget engine could make available a speed of 30 miles per hour in a rookie class (called novices), or one-quarter the speed of the adult car. Most of the competitive classes run speeds near 45 miles per hour. Current upper-class quarter midgets can exceed 45 miles per hour, but remain safe due to the limited size of the track.Introduction to Quarter Midget Racing, Retrieved January 3, 2007 Todd Golden, \\"Sunday special: Terre Haute Quarter Midget Association is a Terre Haute fixture\\", September 17, 2006, Tribune-Star, Terre Haute, Ind.

Jessica Raynor, \\"Quarter-midget racers rev up\\", December 29, 2006, Florida Today, Retrieved January 4, 2007 Many of today's most recognizable names in racing got their start in quarter midgets, including A. J. Foyt, Jeff Gordon, Sarah Fisher, Jimmy Vasser, Joey Logano, Brad Keselowski, Terry Labonte, and Bobby Labonte to name a few. The oldest continually run dirt quarter midget track east of the Mississippi is the Hulman Mini Speedway, operated since 1958 by the Terre Haute Quarter Midget Association (THQMA) located in Terre Haute, Indiana. On the west coast, Capitol Quarter Midget Association has operated a dirt track for quarter midgets since 1954. Jeff Gordon raced at Capitol Quarter Midget Association Quarter midget cars can be reasonably affordable or can cost nearly as much as some full-sized racing cars. Engines can cost from $400 to $8,000. Car chassis can cost from $1,500 (used) up to $6,000 (new). Tires start at $50 each. There are many brands of cars as well as custom cars made by individuals. Some of the common brands are Stanley Racing, N/C chassis (Nervo/Coggin), Talon Chassis, Bullrider Racecars, Tad Fiser Race Cars, Rice Cars, Ashley Chassis, Cobra Race Cars, Storm Chassis, GT American, And Afco race cars. Cars are covered by body panels which are made of fiberglass, aluminum, or occasionally carbon fiber. Engine costs have driven a number of changes over the years. As the cost of the Deco engine platform continued to rise, Honda engines were adopted. The move from Deco to Honda was first highlighted by an exhibition race at the 1988 Western Grands in Pueblo, Colorado. Attempts to put the Deco/Continental engines back into production failed. Later problems with Honda engine revisions and parts tolerances led to the adoption of Briggs & Stratton engines as a cost-effective engine platform. This adoption has come in the form of both the World Formula and Briggs Animal engines. USAC started using Animal engines in 2010. QMA planned to introduce the Animal engine platform beginning in 2012 and begin phasing out the Honda platform altogether in 2013 but has not moved away from the Honda engine platform. USAC includes the Animal and Honda platforms. USAC has recently discarded all of the Deco platform and introduced the Light and Heavy modified World Formula for 2017.

It is the sequel to Splatterhouse 2 and was one of the first games to be given a rating by Sega's own Videogame Rating Council. In North America the game was given an MA-13 rating by the council for its graphic violence and gore. Unlike its predecessors, it was not originally released in Europe. The game was included as an unlockable extra in the 2010 remake, with new artwork replacing the digitized photographs due to legal reasons.New Splatterhouse to Include Original Splatterhouse Trilogy , 1-up Plot The game takes place about five years after the events of Splatterhouse 2. Rick and Jennifer have since married and have a son named David. Rick has also become successful on Wall Street and has bought a mansion in Connecticut, putting the memories of the Terror Mask behind him. Meanwhile, the Mask feels the ancient energy that it recalls from ages past and begins to speak to Rick. Rick must don the mask for the third time and fight the monsters that have invaded his mansion. Rick first fights to save Jennifer, who has been kidnapped by an entity known as the Evil One, but it is revealed this was only a distraction while the Evil One took David. Rick eventually defeats the Evil One, who had planned to use David's latent psychic abilities to unlock the power of an object known as the Dark Stone. Upon defeating the Evil One, the Mask reveals its true, evil intentions. Rick must then destroy the Terror Mask permanently. There are four possible endings, depending on if the player saves Jennifer and David, saves one or the other, or fails to save them both. All but the best ending start out with the Mask saying it will continue to exist as long as there's human suffering, and as it shatters, it says that the sky has cleared, and evil has once again been banished. The endings are as follows. Bad Ending: If Rick fails to save both his wife and child, the ending goes as usual, but it states that Rick \\"stands alone, the weight of failure hanging heavily on him\\". It then shows a picture of him and his family, with the words \\"Alone. All alone...\\" Jennifer Dies: If Rick fails to save Jennifer, but rescues David, it shows the ending as normal, but that Jennifer \\"exists only as a memory\\". It then shows David asking his dad where his mother is, and fades after that. David Dies: If Jennifer is rescued, but David dies, the ending goes on as usual, but with David \\"being only a memory\\". Jennifer then asks Rick where David is, and after being told (though the dialog isn't shown), she cries out \\"no\\". Good Ending: Should both survive, the ending is different. Apart from a more pleasant tune, the mask's dialog changes. Instead of saying that he'll survive, he cries out \\"Can't see... can't hear... I'm dying...!!\\" before shattering. It continues as normal, saying Rick returns to his family, finally free of the Terror Mask. Gameplay The game features six levels, many taking place in the mansion. Instead of the side-scrolling action of the previous games, Splatterhouse 3 features non-linear exploration throughout several different rooms, forcing Rick to often backtrack as he tries to find the exit. Players are given a map of each level. Each level must be cleared in a certain amount of time. Although this does not affect gameplay, running out of time results in changes in the plot, creating four possible endings. By running out of time, for example, Jennifer will be killed in the second level. New to Splatterhouse is the Power Meter, which can be filled by collecting Eldritch Orbs found throughout levels and occasionally are dropped by defeated enemies. Once the bar is filled by at least one orb, the player can transform Rick into a hulking and more monstrous version of himself with the Terror Mask being seemingly fused to his head. In this state, Rick is significantly stronger and can execute a special attack that involves pieces of his flesh extending from his chest area and acting as a weapon, injuring any monster in the vicinity of their reach. Also, instead of actually wielding the weapons he finds, the mutated version of Rick simply flings them at enemies, dealing a fair bit more damage than swinging the weapons as normal Rick would have. Extra lives and health items are also scattered throughout the levels. Passwords are also given to players to return to levels. Occasionally, Rick is able to pick up weapons (e.g. a baseball bat or a cleaver, among others) to use against the monsters. Once you defeat all the monsters in the room an in- game map appears to give you some choice in how you get to the end of each level. The game's storyline alters significantly if you fail to finish levels before the allotted time runs out. For example; in the second level you are tasked with saving Rick's wife Jennifer from being devoured by a boreworm. In order to save her, you must reach the end of the level to confront and defeat the boreworm within the time limit. Failing to do so before the time runs out will result in Jennifer being devoured internally by the boreworm planted inside of her body. Reception Allgame editor Geoffrey Douglas Smith praised Splatterhouse 3, stating that the game \\"stands at the top of the beat-'em-up heap on Genesis\\" and \\"a fun and gory ride with plenty of enemies to pummel and a solid game engine (making the game) a blast to play\\".

It was released in 1977 on Red Star Records and produced by Craig Leon and Marty Thau. The album was recorded in four days at Ultima Sound Studios in New York and featured Martin Rev's minimalist electronics and harsh, repetitive rhythms paired with Alan Vega's rock and roll-inspired vocals and depictions of urban life. Upon its initial release, Suicide was greeted with positive reception from the UK press, but received mixed reviews in the United States, where it failed to chart. However, the album would soon be regarded as a milestone in electronic and rock music. In 2013, Pitchfork named Suicide one of the greatest albums of the 1970s, while in 2012 and 2020, Rolling Stone ranked it as one of the 500 greatest albums of all time. The album also influenced artists in various genres, including Bruce Springsteen, the Fleshtones, Spacemen 3, and Peaches. Production Craig Leon (pictured) was one of the producers on the album. Suicide was the first group to sign to Marty Thau's Red Star record label. Thau had previously worked at Paramount Records and Buddah Records and had sold his assets to Richard Gottehrer to create Red Star Records. After hearing a demo tape from Suicide, he asked if he could see Suicide perform live which led to them being signed to Red Star. Red Star hired Craig Leon to co-produce the record. Suicide entered the studio with much of their songs already written and rehearsed from having spent the previous five years playing shows. The recording of the album was done in four days. Leon had previously worked with reggae musicians Bob Marley and Lee \\"Scratch\\" Perry and seen them create dub-like effects with their music and used an Eventide digital delay unit to create these echo effects on the album's vocal tracks. Leon returned to California after four days of work which led to Marty Thau to work on the rest of the production. Alan Vega changed the lyrics of \\"Frankie Teardrop\\" during the mixing sessions of the album. Thau remixed the tracks \\"Ghost Rider\\", \\"Rocket U.S.A.\\" and \\"Cheree\\". Leon returned to New York where the two remixed \\"Frankie Teardrop\\". The album was mastered at Frankford/Wayne in New York. Style Musically, Suicide has been described as synth-punk, electronic rock, and synth-pop, while also being labeled electronic and minimalist. All the songs on the album have a \\"stripped down\\" sound with Martin Rev providing a backing combining \\"harshly hypnotic organs\\" and \\"dense, unnerving electronics\\". The vocals on the album provided by Alan Vega have been described as similar to Gene Vincent. In 2012, Vega stated that \\"originally I was a rock'n'roll kid; I was born into the rock'n'roll era of 45s in the late fifties\\" and that \\"Elvis Presley to me is like God, and Roy Orbison and Jerry Lee Lewis, they're my triumvirate.\\" \\"Johnny\\" was described by the online music database AllMusic as a showcase for the band's \\"affinity for '50s melodies and images, as well as their pop leanings.\\" Martin Rev described the songs \\"Frankie Teardrop\\", \\"Johnny\\" and \\"Cheree\\" as being about street people. \\"Frankie Teardrop\\" was influenced by a story Alan Vega read in a newspaper about a factory worker who lost his job and resorted to murdering his wife and child before committing suicide. The lyrics of the song were improvised by Vega, who attempted to get into the mindset of both the factory worker and his family. \\"Cheree\\" was about a girlfriend of Martin Rev. Release Suicide was first released in December 1977. Howard Thompson of Bronze Records in the United Kingdom received a copy of the album from the United States. After listening to it he went to New York to see the group perform live and negotiate a deal to license their music for Bronze. The album failed to chart in both the United States and the United Kingdom. A single for the song \\"Cheree\\" was released in May 1978 on both 7-inch and 12-inch vinyl formats. The single featured a remixed version of \\"Cheree\\" with the B-side \\"I Remember\\". John Lydon reviewed the single for the NME, referring to it as \\"Je t'aime with tape hiss\\". The album was re-issued by Red Star Records in 1980. The album has been re-released on other labels including Mute Records in 1998 and Blast First Records on compact disc and digital download formats with varying bonus tracks. Reception Music journalist Tony Fletcher stated that the album \\"struggled for immediate attention\\" due to it being an independent release. The album received positive contemporary reviews from the NME, Time Out and Melody Maker in the United Kingdom. Writing in Sounds, Jon Savage was more circumspect, saying \\"Granted that the monotony is intentional, much of the cut is chilling ‚Äì the screams and drift of the instrument into landscapes of blankness ‚Äì and reaches the sought level of terror. Yeah, and then the mood is broken by dumb lyrics\\". Music critic Robert Christgau gave the album a C+ rating, stating \\"there are little problems like lyrics that reduce serious politics to rhetoric, singing that makes rhetoric sound lurid, and the way the manic eccentricity of this duo's live performance turns to silliness on record\\" Rolling Stone also gave Suicide a negative review, referring to the album as \\"absolutely puerile\\" and Alan Vega's vocals as \\"nothing but arrogance and wholesale insensibility\\". Rolling Stone placed Suicide at number 441 on its 2012 list of the best 500 albums of all time, and at number 498 on a 2020 list. Online music magazine Pitchfork placed the album at number 39 on its list of best albums of the 1970s. The album is listed in the reference book 1001 Albums You Must Hear Before You Die. In her review of Suicide for AllMusic, critic Heather Phares wrote, \\"Proof that punk was more about attitude than a raw, guitar-driven sound, Suicide's self-titled debut set the duo apart from the rest of the style's self-proclaimed outsiders.\\" Spins Joe Gross described the album as \\"beyond classic\\" and found that \\"no one has ever come close to replicating its monolithic vibe.\\" Aftermath, influence and legacy The album was influential in the development of many musical genres, including post-punk, synth-pop and industrial rock. Tony Fletcher wrote in All Hopped Up and Ready to Go: Music from the Streets of New York 1927‚Äì77 that it would \\"in its own way\\", become as influential as other acclaimed punk albums such as Horses, Ramones and Marquee Moon. In 2017, Henry Rollins, singer for Black Flag and Rollins Band, described \\"Frankie Teardrop\\" as \\"the single most intense song I've ever heard in my life\\". Songs from the album have been featured in various forms of media since the album's initial release. Director Rainer Werner Fassbinder contacted Red Star to get the rights for \\"Frankie Teardrop\\" for his film In a Year of 13 Moons. The song is featured during a party scene. \\"Cheree\\" was used by director Edo Bertoglio for his film Downtown 81, a film shot in the early 1980s but not completed until 1999. Several music artists and groups have covered songs from Suicide. The American group the Fleshtones recorded a cover of \\"Rocket U.S.A.\\" for their debut album Blast Off!. The album was produced by Marty Thau and when Alan Vega visited him when he was recording the album at Blank Studios, he was invited to sing while the group performed the song. Bruce Springsteen stated that his song \\"State Trooper\\" from the album Nebraska was heavily influenced by \\"Frankie Teardrop\\". In 2008, a series of EPs were released in tribute to Suicide by various recording artists to celebrate Alan Vega's 70th birthday. Songs from the album that were part of the series included \\"Johnny\\" covered by Peaches, \\"Frankie Teardrop\\" covered by Lydia Lunch, \\"Che\\" by Sunn O))) and Pan Sonic, and \\"Rocket U.S.A.\\" covered by Nik Void Track listing All songs written by Alan Vega and Martin Rev. ;Side one #\\"Ghost Rider\\" ‚Äì 2:34 #\\"Rocket U.S.A.\\" ‚Äì 4:16 #\\"Cheree\\" ‚Äì 3:42 #\\"Johnny\\" ‚Äì 2:11 #\\"Girl\\" ‚Äì 4:05 ;Side two # * \\"Frankie Teardrop\\" ‚Äì 10:26 #\\"Che\\" ‚Äì 4:53 ;Reissue bonus tracks # * \\"Cheree\\" (Remix) #\\"I Remember\\" #\\"Keep Your Dreams\\" ;Bonus disc # \\"Mr Ray\\" (Live at CBGB's) # \\"Las Vegas Man\\" (Live at CBGB's) # \\"96 Tears\\" (Live at CBGB's) # \\"Keep Your Dreams\\" (Live at CBGB's) # \\"I Remember\\" (Live at CBGB's) # \\"Harlem\\" (Live at CBGB's) # \\"23 Minutes Over Brussels\\" Personnel Credits adapted from liner notes. * Suicide ‚Äì arrangement * Timothy Jackson ‚Äì artwork * Larry Alexander ‚Äì engineering * Mitchell Ames ‚Äì assistant audio engineer * Martin Rev ‚Äì keyboards * Craig Leon ‚Äì production * Marty Thau ‚Äì production * Alan Vega ‚Äì vocals See also * 1977 in music * Music of New York City References =Works cited=    External links * Category:1977 debut albums Category:Suicide (band) albums Category:Blast First albums Category:Bronze Records albums Category:Celluloid Records albums Category:Albums produced by Craig Leon ","title":"Suicide (1977 album)"},{"id":"3888254","text":"The Cadillac Gage Commando, frequently denoted as the M706 in U.S. military service, is an American armored car designed to be amphibious. It was engineered by Cadillac Gage specifically for the United States Military Police Corps during the Vietnam War as an armed convoy escort vehicle. The Commando was one of the first vehicles to combine the traditionally separate roles of an armored personnel carrier and a conventional armored car, much like the Soviet BTR-40. Its notable height, amphibious capability, and waterproofed engine allowed American crews to fight effectively in the jungles of Vietnam by observing their opponents over thick vegetation and fording the country's deep rivers. The Commando was eventually produced in three distinct marks: the V-100, V-150, and V-200, all of which were modified for a number of diverse battlefield roles. An unlicensed copy of the Commando series, the Bravia Chaimite, was also manufactured in Portugal. After the American military disengagement from Vietnam, the Commando series was gradually retired from active U.S. service. It was superseded in the Military Police Corps by the derivative M1117 Armored Security Vehicle during the 1990s. Design and development The V-100 series of vehicles was developed in the early 1960s by the Terra-Space division of the Cadillac Gage company of Warren, Michigan. By 1962 a patent was filed and received by Terra-Space for a vehicle then only known as the Commando.Lathrop and McDonald, 2002. pp. 4‚Äì5 The first prototype emerged in 1963, and the production variants entered service in 1964. V-100 (XM706) Armored Car advertisement showing a turret featuring a minigun The vehicle is equipped with four-wheel drive and uses axles similar to the ones used in the M34 series of trucks. The engine is a gasoline-powered 360-cubic- inch Chrysler V8, same as in the early gas models of the M113 armored personnel carriers. Its 5-speed manual transmission allows it to traverse relatively rough terrain. The M706 has a road speed of , and can travel across water at . A Commando's armor consists of high hardness alloy steel called Cadaloy, which protects against projectiles up to 7.62√ó51mm. Partly because of its armor, the M706 has an unloaded mass of over 7 tons. As a result, a common problem with the vehicle is rear axle failure caused by the extreme weight. However, because the armor also provides the monocoque structural framework, it can be lighter than a soft vehicle to which armor has been added, and the angle of the armor also helps protect against hits and mine blasts. The V-100 was available in turret and open-top models. Factory prototype turret options included the T-60, T-70, and T-90. The T-60 featured a combination of either two .50 caliber machine guns, two .30 caliber machine guns, or one of each, and had manual traverse. The specific .30 caliber machine gun options were extremely varied, with from factory configurations including the M1919A4E1, M37, M73, M219, and MG42. Later the M60 and FN MAG were also added to the list of options.Lathrop and McDonald, 2002. p. 10 The Cadillac Gage company also intended to use the solenoid trigger equipped fixed machine gun version of the Stoner 63 weapon system, but this was dropped after tests showed the smaller caliber cartridge to be unsuited to this role.Mongo's Stoner 63A Page. 2005. Stoner 63A Fixed MG . Access Date: 14 February 2008 The T-90 featured a single 20 mm cannon with power traverse. The T-70, developed for police use, featured 4 tear gas launchers, vision blocks all around the turret for 360-degree vision, and no other weapons. The T-70 and T-90 were not put into mass production with a modified T-60, with the guns mounted together in the center, instead of on the outer edges, becoming the standard. A variant of this turret featuring the 7.62 mm General Electric Minigun was also developed.Lathrop and McDonald, 2002. pp. 9‚Äì10 In addition an open-topped variant with a central parapet was developed. The intended usage of this variant was to be a mortar portee, but a total of five machine gun mounts could also be fitted. There were 2 in front, one in the rear all three M2 Browning or Mk 19 capable and one folding pintle point on each side capable of mounting any .30 caliber machine gun such as the M1919 Browning machine gun, M60 or any other machine gun of that class. An enclosed raised superstructure \\"pod\\" was also developed for converting the V-100 into either a command vehicle or for police use. The variants for police work featured special elongated firing ports for better angles of fire for tear gas grenade launchers.Lathrop and McDonald, 2002. p. 10, 42 Relatively large-gunned variants of the V-100 began appearing in 1964, when Cadillac Gage marketed the Commando against the Alvis Saladin and Panhard AML-90 for a Royal Saudi Army requirement specifying a wheeled armoured vehicle equipped with a large semi-automatic cannon.Records of Saudi Arabia, 1961-1965: 1965. Burdett, Anita (editor). British Foreign Office, 1997, Volume 6 p. 57. . A number of V-150s were later successfully tested and offered with a Mecar low-pressure 90mm smoothbore gun. With the new turret and gun, the V-150 was manned by a crew of three, although it retained enough space for eight additional passengers if no additional shell racks were added. At maximum capacity its hull could store up to thirty-nine rounds of 90mm ammunition and still seat four additional passengers. Subsequent V-150 models incorporated a slightly larger turret armed with a much more powerful Cockerill Mk.III 90mm gun, the same as that carried by the EE-9 Cascavel. A third fire support option involved the retrofitting of the Commando chassis with the complete turret and 76mm L23A1 gun of the FV101 Scorpion light tank. Marketing for the V-150 family was halted in 2000.https://www.globalsecurity.org/military/systems/ground/lav-150.htm In 2010, Federal Defense Industries announced that they entered into an agreement with Textron Marine & Land Systems in order to provide authorized aftermarket parts, support and other types of assistance for the V-100/150/200 since FDI maintains a technical library for spare parts.https://web.archive.org/web/20190615075157/https://www.fdi.us.com/cadillac- gage In 2011, Napco entered into an agreement with Textron to provide authorized aftermarket parts, support and other types of assistance for the V-100/150.http://www.napcointl.com/Napco%20General%20Presentation.pdf Operational use Fort Leonard Wood. US Air Force Security Policemen aboard a V-100 (XM-706E2) during exercise Team Spirit '81. The Commando was originally deployed to South Vietnam in September 1963Doyle, p. 2 for use by the U.S. Army Military Police, United States Air Force, United States Marine Corps and allied forces including the Army of the Republic of Vietnam (ARVN). It was introduced in Vietnam as the XM706 Commando first to the ARVN who loaned the first examples to the U.S. Army in June 1967. By the end of 1968, the U.S. Army had purchased its own version of the armored car, the XM706E1, later standardized as the M706. Within the U.S. Army it was affectionately known as the Duck, or the V. The main differences between the XM706 and XM706E1/M706 were in the design of the gas tank fill port covers, side windows, front vision blocks, and most importantly in the weaponry. The XM706 featured two .30-06 caliber M37 machine guns, while the XM706E1/M706 for the U.S. Army featured two 7.62mm NATO M73 machine guns for better ammunition commonality with existing weapons. The ARVN, on the other hand, were still using a variety of weapons in the .30-06 caliber and had relevant ammunition in their supply train. In practice, the ARVN found the standard two-gun armament to be lacking and often mounted an additional M1919A4 machine gun on a standard tripod mount at the rear radio operator's hatch.Lathrop and McDonald, 2002. p. 17 A number of their V-100s were also refitted with the combination turret armament of one M37 and one .50 BMG-caliber M2HB machine gun.Lathrop and McDonald, 2002. p. 15 The V-100 in with the ARVN mainly saw service in armored car elements of armored cavalry units, but also as part of the mechanized platoons of the South Vietnamese Regional Forces.United States, 1971. p. I-8 Compared to the American counterparts ARVN V-100 units had larger crews, including a commander riding shotgun, and a radio operator outside the rear hatch. Two V-100 (XM-706E2) of the USAF Security Police on patrol, circa 1968. Another model, the XM706E2, was supplied to the U.S. Air Force for base protection purposes, post-attack reconnaissance against munitions and EOD use. The XM706E2 featured no turret and an open-topped center parapet. In practice a variety of weapons were mounted on USAF XM706E2s, but the most common configuration was one M2HB machine gun and one M60 machine gun. Other equipment included the XM174 40 mm grenade launcher and searchlights. The 3rd Security Police Group of the United States Air Force at Clark Air Base Republic of the Philippines was still operating the \\"Duck\\" as a Fire-Team vehicle until it received M1026 HMMWVs in the fall of 1988. The vehicles were then semi-retired, and occasionally used as \\"steel\\" bunkers at the gates, because of the difficulty in keeping the 20-year-old vehicles running. The V-100 carries a maximum crew of two with up to 10 passengers. In road patrol, convoy duty and base defense use by the U.S. Army's Military Police, it usually had a crew of two: driver and gunner. Additional armament often included two or three top-mounted M2 or M60 machine guns. Other weapons such as M134 Miniguns were also sometimes used. Passengers could also use their personal weapons to fire through the vehicle's various gun ports. In spite of its effectiveness during the Vietnam War, the U.S. military made limited use of the V-100s after the war, deploying only small units of the armored cars with U.S. Army Military Police platoons at the Herlong Army Depot in California during the 1970s, or other related sites across the country. The remaining V-100s were expended as \\"hard targets\\" for tank and machinegun ranges throughout various military installations. However, survivors remain in service with various smaller forces, such as the People's Army of Vietnam, Royal Thai Army, Republic of China Military Police, the Philippine Army, Marine Corps, and Special Action Force of the Philippine National Police, the Lebanese Armed Forces, the Army of Venezuela and the Jamaican Defence Force. It was used by the Malaysian Army in Second Malayan Emergency (now retired) and Royal Malaysian Police (GOF- Pasukan Gerakan Am) until now. The vehicle is also used by many SWAT units in the U.S. and gendarmerie forces overseas. The V-100 is the predecessor of the M1117 Armored Security Vehicle which is being used by the U.S. Army for convoy protection and other duties in Iraq and Afghanistan. For many years the Los Angeles Police Department (LAPD) had used 2 V-100s and used them for high risk warrant arrests. They pioneered the first SWAT teams and were the first to use the V-100 as a law enforcement vehicle. Typically a court issued warrant was required to use them, however the LAPD had deployed them outside of that requirement. On a moment's notice the LAPD Metropolitan Division could have a V-100 (nicknamed the \\"tank\\") in the field for shooting scenarios as well as officer assistance calls. Instead of outfitting these vehicles with guns the LAPD would attach a battering ram. The battering rams flat end was decorated with a smiley face and captioned \\"Have a nice day.\\" The LAPD has retired the V-100 vehicles. Today some SWAT teams around the nation have similar V-100s. On the A&E; TV show \\"Detroit SWAT\\" a V-100 with a battering ram is often seen being used by the Detroit SWAT team. Most SWAT operations now are more updated with better equipped APCs and armored vans. However, when needed, the V-100 continues to be a valuable tool for making a tactical entrance on a building, residence, etc. Variants Royal Malaysia Police General Operations Forces personnel on V-150 fighting vehicle in jungle operation, 1985 Singapore Army V-200 Commando with 20mm cannon Cadillac Gage's basic V-100 vehicle spawned an entire series of vehicles. This development was continued even after the production and further development of the system was passed to Marine and Land Division of the Textron company. These included updated 4√ó4 vehicles, but also expanded 6√ó6 vehicles utilizing a similar design and some basic components. =V-150= The V-150 was a hybrid variant which actually came after the V-200 and was based on the V-200 but had some V-100 features. It could be equipped with diesel or gasoline engines and most were produced for the Saudi Arabian National Guard as the V-150S. The V-150 was initially fitted with the same Chrysler V6 gasoline engine and three-speed transmission as the V-100, but these were later superseded by a Cummins eight-cylinder engine and a four-speed automatic transmission.Hunnicutt, 2002. pp. 200‚Äì205 Unlike the V-200, all V-150s retained the same size and dimensions of the earlier V-100s; however, they were manufactured with heavier axles and modified suspension units. The V-150's hull was also designed specifically to carry heavier weapons systems, such as large smoothbore guns for fire support and anti-tank purposes. In the 1980s Portugal updated its Chaimites (originally built between 1967 and 1974) with a 90 mm turret (V-400), but the Portuguese Army also bought 15 examples of the U.S.-made V-150 Commando.Areamilitar. Chaimite V-400 - BRAVIA . Access Date: 12 January 2008Areamilitar. LAV-150 - Textron Marine & Land/Portugal . Access Date: 12 January 2008 The Philippine Army continue to use their V-150s in 2017, when several photos appeared on social media of a vehicle with heavy wooden planks and flattened ammunition crates were applied as improvised armour against ISIS insurgents in the southern islands. The effectiveness of the improvised vehicle armour against proper rocket propelled grenades is doubtful, but it's judged to reduce some of the RPG's damage. =V-200= The V-200 was essentially an enlarged version of the V-100 and utilized many components of the U.S. Army's 5-ton trucks. This version was designed to the specifications of the Singapore Armed Forces (SAF) and entered service in 1968. It was fitted with a custom diesel engine and was notably heavier than the V-100. ST Kinetics upgraded the Singaporean fleet of V-200 vehicles in 2002 with electric turret drives and made some detail improvements to both the engine and transmission. The Singapore Army continued to hold two hundred V-200s in reserve until 2015, when they were formally retired and replaced by the Peacekeeper Protected Response Vehicle (PRV). Fifty V-200s were operated by the Republic of Singapore Air Force for on-base security and equipped with Swedish-manufactured RBS 70 surface to air missiles in a turret mount. It is unclear whether these were retired in 2015 as well. =LAV-300= Originally named as the V-300, the LAV-300 is a 6√ó6 variant originally designed for a heavy weapons support role. =LAV-600= The V-600 is a much heavier version of the V-300 and was intended to fulfill heavier weapons support.

Dedicated to Eliphalet Nott, president of Union for a remarkable sixty-two years (1804‚Äì1866), the high by wide structure is a National Historic Landmark, noted for its distinctive and colorful Victorian architecture. Design Nott Memorial in 1962 Officially designated Nott Memorial Hall but referred to by generations of students and faculty simply as \\"The Nott\\", the building's centrality and initial design trace back to Josef Ramee's 1813 conception of the school grounds, the first planned college campus in the United States. The Memorial was designed by Edward Tuckerman Potter, architect of area churches and homes, alumnus of the college, and grandson of President Nott. Construction began in 1858 and was completed in 1879. The result is one of very few 16-sided buildings in the world. For nearly a century the Nott was mostly open inside. In 1961 the college moved its bookstore into the basement and configured the first two floors into theater in the round. The upper floors were eventually closed off and fell into disrepair. Restoration Interior of the Nott Memorial In 1993 the college began a complete renovation of the Nott, restoring it to its original design. The award-winning project was undertaken by noted Boston based architecture firm Finegold Alexander + Associates Inc and carried out by A.J. Martini, Inc., contractors. The bookstore and theater were moved to other locations on the campus, and in 1995 the Nott reopened on the celebration of Union's 200th anniversary. Once again, the center of the Nott is completely open to the top of its dome overhead. The main floor is a meeting room with seating for up to 400; the second and third levels ring the space and include galleries and informal meeting places for students. Two-hundred eighty-eight restored stained glass windows bathe the interior in colored light. Atop the dome a quotation in colored slate from Rabbi Tarfon, found in the Talmud's Pirkei Avot, proclaims in Hebrew: \\"The day is short, the work is great, the reward is much, the Master is urgent.\\" The Memorial was listed on the National Register of Historic Places in 1972 and was further declared a National Historic Landmark in 1986. and =Mandeville Gallery= The Interior of the Nott Memorial. The Mandeville Gallery is the second floor. The Mandeville Gallery opened in 1995 following the major restoration of the Nott Memorial and is located on the second floor. The Mandeville Gallery presents changing exhibitions featuring nationally recognized, contemporary artists exploring modern issues. The Wikoff Student Gallery is located on the third floor of the Nott Memorial and presents changing exhibitions featuring the work of current, full-time Union College students. Due to the unusual architecture of the Nott Memorial, the Mandeville Gallery provides a unique environment for viewing exhibitions. The Gallery is a mezzanine, open to the floors above and below, and is composed of two semi-circular areas of viewing, creating an atypical but creative gallery venue. All gallery exhibitions and events are free and open to the public.

It did not share the same success with American audiences, running for only 16 performances on Broadway in early 1973. Plot The farce surrounds an assistant bank manager, Peter Hunter, who lives in a flat above his bank with his new bride Frances. When Frances innocently sends a mail order off for some Scandinavian glassware, what comes back is Scandinavian pornography. The two, along with the bank's frantic chief cashier Brian Runnicles, must decide what to do with the veritable floods of pornography, photographs, books, films and eventually girls that threaten to engulf this happy couple. The matter is considerably complicated by the presence of Eleanor (Peter's mother), Mr. Bromhead (his boss), Mr. Needham (a visiting bank inspector) and Vernon Paul (a police superintendent). Stage play The part of Brian Runnicles was first played on the London stage by Michael Crawford. He later adopted a similar persona as Frank Spencer in Some Mothers Do 'Ave 'Em. David Jason later took over the role of Brian Runnicles. Frances Hunter was played initially by Belinda Carroll. The play has also been produced internationally, such as in Singapore and Kuala Lumpur in May 2015 by the British Theatre Playhouse. Film version A film version starring Ronnie Corbett as Brian was made in 1973. There were many alterations to the script, including significant changes in dialogue, plot elements and, most notably, to names: \\"Eleanor\\" was changed to \\"Bertha\\", \\"Mr. Bromhead\\" was changed to \\"Mr. Bromley\\" and \\"Peter\\" and \\"Frances\\" became \\"David\\" and \\"Penny\\", respectively.

So as to meet the tight deadline, the editorial staff and art director had to make severe cuts. Despite of these cuts to meet the deadline, the issue was delayed for a month by the printing house commissioned for the job. When it arrived on February 28, the paper copies were a disaster. The colours were washed out and seemed printed by a home office printer, and the edges of the pages were not equally cut.

The registry is coordinated by the United States Department of Justice and operates a web site search tool allowing a user to submit a single query to obtain information about sex offenders throughout the United States. Purpose State sex-offender registration and notification programs are designed, in general, to include information about offenders who have been convicted of a \\"criminal offense against a victim who is a minor\\" or a \\"sexually violent offense,\\" as specified in the Jacob Wetterling Crimes Against Children and Sexually Violent Offender Registration Act (\\"the Wetterling Act\\")law.cornell.edu ‚Äì more specifically, information about persons convicted of offenses involving sexual molestation or sexual exploitation of children, and persons convicted of rape and rape-like offenses (regardless of the age of the victim), respectively.

For example, one state may limit public disclosure over its web site of information concerning offenders who have been determined to be high-risk, while another state may provide for wider disclosure of offender information but make no representation as to risk level of specific offenders. Members of the public may be able to obtain certain types of information about specific offenders who reside, work, or attend school in the state and have been convicted of one or more of the types of offenses specified below, depending on the specific parameters of a given State's public notification program.

Constitutionality =U.S. Supreme Court rulings= In two cases docketed for argument on November 13, 2003, the sex offender registries of two states, Alaska and Connecticut, would face legal challenge. This was the first instance that the Supreme Court had to examine the implementation of sex offender registries in throughout the U.S. The ruling would let the states know how far they could go in informing citizens of perpetrators of sex crimes. The constitutionality of the registries was challenged in two ways: Ex post facto challenge In Smith v. Doe, 538 U.S. 84 (2003), the Supreme Court upheld Alaska's sex-offender registration statute. Reasoning that sex offender registration deals with civil laws, not punishment, the Court ruled 6-3 that it is not an unconstitutional ex post facto law. Justices John Paul Stevens, Ruth Bader Ginsburg, and Stephen Breyer dissented. However, On July 25, 2008, Doe number two prevailed and the Alaska Supreme Court ruled that the Alaska Sex Offender Registration Act's registration violated the ex post facto clause of the state's constitution and ruled that the requirement does not apply to persons who committed their crimes before the act became effective on August 10, 1994. Due process challenge In Connecticut Dept. of Public Safety v. Doe, 538 U.S. 1 (2003),Connecticut Dept. of Public Safety v. Doe (01-1231) 538 U.S. 1(2003). the Court ruled that Connecticut's sex-offender registration statute did not violate the procedural due process of those to whom it applied, although the Court \\"expresses no opinion as to whether the State's law violates substantive due process principles.\\" Update: Reynolds V. United States Certiorari to the United States Court of Appeals for the Third Circuit No. 10‚Äì6549. Argued October 3, 2011‚ÄîDecided January 23, 2012 \\"The Act does not require pre-Act offenders to register before the Attorney General validly specifies that the Act's registration provisions apply to them.\\" =State Court rulings= Hawaii In State v. Bani, 36 P.3d 1255 (Haw. 2001), the Hawaii State Supreme Court held that Hawaii's sex offender registration statute violated the due process clause of the Constitution of Hawaii, ruling that it deprived potential registrants \\"of a protected liberty interest without due process of law.\\" The Court reasoned that the sex offender law authorized \\"public notification of (the potential registrant's) status as a convicted sex offender without notice, an opportunity to be heard, or any preliminary determination of whether and to what extent (he) actually represents a danger to society.\\"State v. Bani, 36 P.3d 1255 (Haw. 2001) Alaska After losing the constitutional challenge in the US Supreme Court in 2002 one of the two Doe's in the case committed suicide. The other Doe began a new challenge in the state courts. Per the ALASKA DEPARTMENT OF PUBLIC SAFETY website: On July 25, 2008, Doe number two prevailed and the Alaska Supreme Court ruled that the Alaska Sex Offender Registration Act's registration violated the ex post facto clause of the state's constitution and ruled that the requirement does not apply to persons who committed their crimes before the act became effective on August 10, 1994. Maryland In March 2013 Maryland Court of Appeals (Highest court of Maryland) decision Doe v. DPSCS declared that Maryland's existing registry laws are punitive in effect, and therefore could not constitutionally be applied retroactively to persons whose crimes pre-dated registration. RSOL's Maryland chapter, FAIR (Families Advocating Intelligent Registries was part of the Amicus Curiae, testifying for the de facto punitive effects of Maryland sex offender law cited in the decision. This decision was further solidified in 2014 with the \\"Doe 2\\" decision. The full impact of these decisions in Maryland is still being effected. Missouri Many successful challenges to sex offender registration laws in the United States have been in Missouri because of a unique provision in the Missouri Constitution (Article I, Section 13) prohibiting laws \\"retrospective in [their] operation.\\"Missouri Constitution In Doe v. Phillips, 194 S.W.3d 837 (Mo. banc 2006), the Supreme Court of Missouri held that the Missouri Constitution did not allow the state to place anyone on the registry who had been convicted or pleaded guilty to a registrable offense before the sex offender registration law went into effect on January 1, 1995.Doe v. Phillips, 194 S.W.3d 837 (Mo. banc 2006) and remanded the case for further consideration in light of that holding. On remand, the Jackson County Circuit Court entered an injunction ordering that the applicable individuals be removed from the published sex offender list.Doe v. Keathley, Case No. WD68066 (Mo. App. slip op. Apr. 1, 2008) Defendant Colonel James Keathley appealed that order to the Missouri Court of Appeals in Kansas City, which affirmed the injunction on April 1, 2008. Keathley filed an appeal with the Supreme Court of Missouri. In response to these rulings, in 2007, several Missouri state Senators proposed an amendment to the Missouri Constitution that would exempt sex offender registration laws from bar on retrospective civil laws.St. Louis Post-Dispatch: \\"Legislators focus on sex offenders,\\" April 11, 2007. The proposed amendment passed the State Senate unanimously but was not passed by the Missouri House of Representatives before the end of the 2007 legislative session.\\"Bill backup clogs waning session\\", The Kansas City Star, April 9, 2007 The same constitutional amendment was proposed in and passed by the Missouri Senate again in 2008, but also was not passed by the House of Representatives by the end of that year's legislative session.Missouri General Assembly Actions on SJR 34 As a result, the decisions of the Missouri courts prohibiting the retrospective application of sex offender laws remained intact. The Missouri Supreme Court ruled on Keathley's appeal (Doe v. Phillips now styled Doe v. Keathley) on June 16, 2009. The Court held that the Missouri Constitution's provision prohibiting laws retrospective in operation no longer exempts individuals from registration if they are subject to the independent Federal obligation created under the Sexual Offenders Registration and Notification Act (SORNA), 42 U.S.C. ¬ß 16913.Doe et. al. v. Keathley et. al., No. SC89727 As a result, many offenders who were previously exempt under the Court's 2006 holding in Doe v. Phillips were once again required to register. On January 12, 2010, Cole County Circuit Judge Richard Callahan ruled that individuals who plead guilty to a sex offense are not required to register under Federal Law and thus are not required to register in Missouri if the date of their plea was prior to the passage of the Missouri registration law. Missouri also has a number of laws that restrict the activities of persons required to register as sex offenders, several of which have also been challenged as being retrospective in their operation. On February 19, 2008, the Supreme Court of Missouri held that a law prohibiting registered sex offenders from residing within one thousand feet of a school was retrospective in operation as applied to registered sex offenders who had resided at a location within such a distance prior to the enactment of the law.R.L. v. Missouri Department of Corrections, Case No. SC88644 (Mo. banc slip op. Feb. 19, 2008) Another exception to the school-residence proximity requirement was handed down by the Court on January 12, 2010 in F.R. v. St. Charles County Sheriff's Department. In this case, F.R. was convicted prior to the enactment of the law and the Court held that, as such, he was not required to abide by the restriction.F.R. v. St. Charles County Sheriff's Department, No. SC89834 Consolidated with F.R. was State of Missouri v. Raynor, in which the Court found that Charles A. Raynor was not required to comply with R.S.Mo. ¬ß 589.426, a law restricting the activities of registered sex offenders on Halloween.State of Missouri v. Charles A. Raynor, No. SC90164 In both F.R. and Raynor, the ruling applies only to the named party.

The establishment of this second Greek state had its origins in the debate over Greece's entry into the war on behalf of the Entente, as advocated by Venizelos, or a Germanophile neutrality as preferred by King Constantine I. This dissension soon began to divide Greek society around the two leaders, beginning the so-called \\"National Schism\\". In August 1916, as parts of eastern Macedonia were not defended by the royal government against a Bulgarian invasion, Venizelist officers of the Hellenic Army launched an Entente-supported coup in Thessaloniki. After a brief hesitation, Venizelos and his principal supporters joined the uprising and began the establishment of a second Greek government in the north of the country, which entered the war on the side of the Entente. The National Defence government endured until June 1917, when the Entente powers forced Constantine I to abdicate, and allowed Venizelos to return to Athens as Prime Minister of a unified country. Nevertheless, the establishment of the National Defence government deepened the rift of the National Schism, which would plague Greek political life for over a generation, and contribute to the Asia Minor Catastrophe. Background: Greece 1914-1916 Greece had emerged victorious from the 1912-1913 Balkan Wars, with her territory almost doubled, but found itself in a difficult international situation. The status of the Greek- occupied eastern Aegean islands was left undetermined, and the Ottoman Empire continued to claim them, leading to a naval arms race and mass expulsions of ethnic Greeks from Anatolia. In the north, Bulgaria, defeated in the Second Balkan War, harbored revanchist plans against Greece and Serbia. The two countries were bound by a treaty of alliance which promised military assistance in case of a Bulgarian attack, but in August 1914, the danger would emerge from a different quarter altogether: the Assassination of Archduke Franz Ferdinand led to the declaration of war by Austria-Hungary on Serbia and the outbreak of the First World War. Arrival of Venizelos in Mytilini, June 1916 Proclamation of the Venizelist government in Thessaloniki, September 1916 Demonstration The National Defence government: the Triumvirate with collaborators on 29 September 1916 (O.S.) Greece, like Bulgaria, initially maintained neutrality, but as the war continued, both warring camps began wooing the two countries. At this point the first rifts appeared among the Greek leadership: Prime Minister Eleftherios Venizelos, at the helm since 1910 of a modernising government looking towards the British and French models, supported entry in the war on the side of the Entente, while King Constantine I, who had been educated in Germany, married to Kaiser Wilhelm II's sister and a deep admirer of Prussian militarism, anticipated a German victory. Aware that Greece was vulnerable to the British Fleet, he advocated a course of neutrality. In early 1915 the British offered Greece \\"territorial concessions in Asia Minor\\" if it would participate in the upcoming Gallipoli Campaign. Venizelos supported this idea, but run into the opposition from the King and his military advisors. As a result, Venizelos submitted his resignation on , and was replaced by a led by Dimitrios Gounaris. The Liberal Party won the subsequent May 1915 elections and Venizelos again formed a on . When Bulgaria mobilized against Serbia in September 1915, Venizelos ordered a Greek counter- mobilization and called upon the Anglo-French to establish themselves in Thessaloniki (then widely known as Salonica) as to aid Serbia. Indeed, the Allies began landing on 22 September 1915 and started entrenching themselves at the . The King unconstitutionally dismissed Venizelos and the parliament, making the breach between the two men and their followers irreparable. The Liberals boycotted the December 1915 elections. In the same month, the French, with the permission of Venizelos, occupied Corfu, where the remains of the Serbian Army were gathered before being sent to Thessaloniki. In view of these events, a clandestine \\"Revolutionary Committee of National Defence\\" was formed in Thessaloniki by a group of prominent Liberals and representatives of all over Macedonia, including Konstantinos Angelakis (mayor of Thessaloniki), and (representatives of Thessaloniki), and (representatives of Serres), Nikolaos Manos (representative of Kozani), Panayiotis Grekos (representative of Florina), (representative of Drama), Major General Emmanouil Zymvrakakis and others. The group acknowledged Venizelos as its leader, and began approaching officers of the Army and the Cretan Gendarmerie. During the following year, Greece's official governments were hard-pressed to maintain the country's neutrality. The final straw came when, on , the Athens government, succumbing to German pressure, ordered the surrender of the vital Rupel Fortress to the Germans and their Bulgarian Allies. In response, on , the pro-Entente Venizelists imposed martial law, effectively abolishing royal sovereignty in all of northern Greece. On , the Bulgarian invasion of eastern Macedonia commenced, facing little resistance, since the Athens government refused to condone any firm action. As a result, more than 6000 men of IV Corps surrendered to the Germans on and were deported to G√∂rlitz in Germany. This surrender of hard-won territories with only token resistance, outraged most Greeks. At the same time, the establishment of the exiled Serbian King and his government in Thessaloniki in April, the presence of 120,000 Serbian troops in the Macedonian Front, accompanied by threats from the Entente that he would install a Serbian prefect in the city, raised fears that the city would be handed over to the Serbians. Uprising in Thessaloniki Incensed by the successive humiliations and the Bulgarian advance in Macedonia, several Greek officers had flocked to Thessaloniki and volunteered to raise troops and join the Allies. The local Allied commander-in-chief, Maurice Sarrail, welcomed their initiatives, but little headway was made due to the opposition of the Greek government. On 16/29 August, the Lt. Colonel Konstantinos Mazarakis- Ainian tried to seize control of the 11th Infantry Division's mountain artillery battalion, and lead it to the front. This was opposed by Colonel Nikolaos Trikoupis, the chief of staff and acting commander of III Army Corps, who sent two companies to the artillery barracks at Mikro Karabournou that forced Mazarakis to abandon his attempt and withdraw from the barracks. Restaurant \\"Verdun\\" in Thessaloniki, decorated in support of Venizelos and the National Defence regime, 1916. This incident sparked the flame of a wider uprising on the next day, , by the city's pro-Venizelist officers. Under the command of Lt. Colonel , about 600 men of the Cretan Gendarmerie with three volunteer companies under Major Neokosmos Grigoriadis and thirty other officers blockaded the headquarters of III Corps. When a company under Colonel Vagias tried to break through the blockade, shots were fired that killed two gendarmes and wounded three others. In response, the Cretans fired back, killing or wounding three or four soldiers. The firefight was stopped by the intervention of French officers. Sarrail arrived on the scene soon after, and commanded all Greek officers who would not join the newly formed \\"National Defence Committee\\" uprising to be shipped to southern Greece. The loyalist troops were disarmed and interned in the hopes that they would join the uprising, but in the event most of them refused and had to be sent to southern Greece as well. Individual officers from across northern Greece began to flock to Thessaloniki, and on , the \\"National Defence\\" received its first substantial reinforcement, as Colonel Nikolaos Christodoulou arrived in the city with the remnants of IV Corps that had refused to surrender and instead withdrawn via Kavala and Samothrace. Already on , the volunteers under Major Grigoriadis formed the 1st Battalion of the \\"Army of National Defence\\", and departed for the front lines along the Strymon river.

Venizelos himself with his closest aides left Athens on 12/25 September, initially for his home island of Crete, and from there via Chios and Lesbos to Thessaloniki, where he arrived on 24 September/7 October. Four days later, on 28 September/11 October, he formed a provisional government under the supreme leadership of a triumvirate comprising himself, General Panagiotis Danglis and Admiral Pavlos Koundouriotis (the \\"Triumvirate of National Defence\\", Œ§œÅŒπŒ±ŒΩŒ¥œÅŒØŒ± œÑŒ∑œÇ ŒïŒ∏ŒΩŒπŒ∫ŒÆœÇ ŒëŒºœçŒΩŒ∑œÇ). On 29 September/12 October, Maj Gen Emmanouil Zymvrakakis was appointed Army Minister (replaced on December 6 by Maj Gen Konstantinos Miliotis-Komninos) and on October 3 Nikolaos Politis was appointed Foreign Minister. On 6 October other ministries, euphemistically called \\"General Directorates\\" were established: * Themistoklis Sophoulis, Interior Minister * , Finance Minister * Thalis Koutoupis, Minister of National Economy * , Justice Minister * Georgios Averof, Education Minister * , Transport Minister * , Minister for Supply and Food Distribution * , Minister for the Refugees * Andreas Michalakopoulos, Minister for Public Estates and Resettlement The first tasks of the new government were the establishment of an \\"Army of National Defence\\" to fight alongside the Allies, and the consolidation of its rule in as much of Greece as possible. The Provisional Government declared war on the Central Powers on 24 November 1916, and set out to recruit divisions for the Macedonian Front, something which was achieved with speed and often ruthlessness. Despite calls by some officers to abolish the monarchy and declare a Republic, Venizelos chose a more moderate path. He had declared: \\"we are not against the King, but against the Bulgarians\\". The State of National Defence established control in Greek Macedonia, Crete and the northern Aegean islands; lands that were just recently liberated during the Balkan Wars. The reluctant and uneasy coexistence of the two Greek states was not destined to last, as the Noemvriana riots against Venizelists in Athens clearly illustrated that a rapprochement was now impossible. Early in 1917, the Venizelist state took also control of Thessaly, after clashes against the royal army of Constantine. The division of the country lasted for 9 months. On 15 June 1917 an Allied ultimatum forced King Constantine to abdicate in favour of his second-born son, Alexander, and, with the rest of his family, leave the country for Switzerland. Venizelos returned to Athens, as head of a superficially reunified Greece, and led it to victory alongside the Allies in World War I, but also in its entanglement in the subsequent Asia Minor Campaign. As such, the immediate aims of the \\"National Defence\\" were met. But the revolution was also an expression of the wide rift between the quasi- Republican, progressive Venizelists and the conservative Royalists/Anti- Venizelists, and its outbreak marks also the beginning of the Greek National Schism which would leave a troublesome legacy to the country, as it continued in various forms up to the 1970s. In popular culture A popular song of the era celebrating the movement was performed by the musical Estudiantina of Smyrna named Tis aminis ta pedi√† (the lads of the Defence) or the Macedon. The song was performed also in the film Rebetiko of Costas Ferris in orchestration of Stavros Xarchakos.

As a popular part of traditional Japanese cuisine, takuan is often served uncooked alongside other types of tsukemono ('pickled things'). It is also enjoyed at the end of meals as it is thought to aid digestion. History In Japan, Takuan S≈çh≈ç is credited with concocting this yellow pickle, which now bears his name.Nagamura, Kit. \\"All at sea in Shinagawa\\". The Japan Times Online. October 5, 2007.

It is eaten as a side dish during meals, and eaten as a snack at teatime. Strip-cut takuan is often used for Japanese bento. Traditional takuan‚Äîusing daikon radish that has been sun-dried and then pickled in a rice bran bed‚Äîis sometimes stir-fried or braised when getting older and sour. Some sushi rolls use strip-cut takuan for ingredients, e.g. shinkomaki (takuan only) and torotaku-maki (maguro [fatty tuna] and takuan). =In Korea= Takuan is called danmuji () in Korea. Danmuji is a common banchan (side dish) served with bunsik (light meal or snack), as well as with Korean Chinese dishes. Production Drying radish on a farm in Japan In the traditional process of making takuan, the first step is to hang a daikon radish in the sun for a few weeks by the leaves until it becomes dehydrated and flexible. Next, the daikon is placed in a pickling crock and covered with a mixture of salt, rice bran, optionally sugar, daikon greens, kombu, and perhaps chilli pepper and/or dried persimmon peels. A weight is then placed on top of the crock, and the daikon is allowed to pickle for several months. The finished takuan is usually yellow in color and quite pungent. Most mass- produced takuan uses salt or syrup to reduce the dehydration time and artificial color to enhance the appearance. Iburi-gakko (lit. 'smoked takuan') is eaten in Akita Prefecture in the North. It is smoked rather than sun-dried before pickling.

The railroad made its last run in February 1949. Background From 1887 to 1918, Colorado Midland Railroad operated rail service along a 222-mile line from Colorado City (now Old Colorado City), through Ute Pass and across the Continental Divide, to New Castle a coal mining town that was west of Glenwood Springs. It was the first standard gauge railroad through the Rocky Mountains. Travelers heading for Cripple Creek would get off the train at Divide and take the Hundley Stage along the toll road to the town. In 1892, passengers could also travel to Cripple Creek from Canon City via the Florence and Cripple Creek Railroad, a narrow gauge line. History When gold was discovered in Cripple Creek and Victor in 1890, some of the Colorado Midland owners formed the Midland Terminal Railroad, a standard gauge spur line from Divide to Cripple Creek. This allowed for passenger travel to and from Cripple Creek, shipment of equipment into the area, and the transport of ore to processing mills in Colorado City beginning in 1895. It was the only standard gauge railroad into Cripple Creek and Victor, which made for easy transfer of material at the Divide junction with the Colorado Midland Railway. The Colorado Springs and Cripple Creek District Railway was built by 1911 to transport ore from the Cripple Creek mining district through the mountains‚Äîon what is now Gold Camp Road or Teller County 8‚Äîdirectly to the processing facilities in Old Colorado City. Eleven miles shorter distance than the Colorado Midland Railway, it was nicknamed the \\"Short Line\\" and offered freight and passenger service. Transportation across the Short Line reduced the cost of shipment as compared to what had been paid to the Colorado Midland Railway. Colorado Midland Railway went into foreclosure in 1917 and Albert E. Carlton bought the company and ore began to be shipped through the Midland Terminal Railway to Old Colorado City. Expenses mounted after the United States Railroad Administration began shipping materials to supply World War I troops through the Colorado Midland Railway lines, across railroad tracks and beds not able to accommodate the additional trains and tonnage. By August 1918 the railway ceased operations. In 1919, the terminal facilities at Old Colorado City and the abandoned tracks between Old Colorado City and Divide were sold to the Midland Terminal Railway, owned by Carlton and Spencer Penrose. The following year the line through Victor was extended to La Bella Junction. Passengers, mail, and ore was transported along the now Midland Terminal Railway tracks from Cripple Creek to Old Colorado City, but scheduled passenger service ended in 1931. After 1934, 90% of the railroad's business was transporting ore to the Golden Cycle Mining and Reduction Company, which was the only remaining ore processing facility in Old Colorado City. There was some freight and ore shipped across the rails during World War II, but business dropped off thereafter. The railway had abandoned the Taylor Switchback to the Independence Mine in 1930 and in 1948 a total of of track from Old Colorado Springs to Cripple Creek, within the Cripple Creek mining district, and the spur in Old Colorado City to the Golden Cycle Mining and Reduction Company. Legacy Some of the old buildings at the Midland Terminal headquarters in Colorado Springs are in use today, notably the old roundhouse, which was purchased by Van Briggle Pottery in 1955,Van Briggle Pottery - History and the machine shop, which is now the Ghost Town Museum. U.S. Route 24 follows the former railroad's route over Ute Pass. Two miles of the former railroad's right of way is currently used by the Cripple Creek and Victor Narrow Gauge Railroad. Another segment is being converted to a multi- use trail connecting the Pikes Peak Greenway to Manitou Springs. Portions of the roadbed and right of way from Divide, Colorado, to Cripple Creek, Colorado, are in use as Highway 67. A former wood-shored Midland Terminal tunnel was used as a one-lane highway tunnel on CO 67 until the 1990s; after a partial collapse the tunnel was bypassed with a new cut and the tunnel remains as a landmark, its ends are closed with a grille so the interior and shoring can be seen today.

Route description Alpharetta SR 120 begins at an intersection with SR 100 (Bowdon Street) in Tallapoosa, in Haralson County. It heads northeast into Buchanan. Here, it first intersects US 27 Business/SR 1 Business. Then, it meets US 27/SR 1\\\\. Just before leaving the county, it enters Draketown, where it intersects SR 113 (Buchanan Highway). The two routes run concurrent to the northeast. In Paulding County, it enters Union. There, they intersect SR 101\\\\. At this intersection, SR 113 departs to the north. About later, it intersects SR 120 Connector (Scoggins Road). Nearly later, SR 120 enters Dallas. Almost immediately, it meets US 278/SR 6 (Jimmy Campbell Parkway). At this intersection, SR 6 Business (Buchanan Street) east begins and heads northeastward. US 278/SR 6/SR 120 head concurrently to the southeast. At the east end of town is SR 61 (Nathan Dean Boulevard). Farther to the east, in Hiram, the concurrency intersects SR 360 and Bill Carruth Parkway. At this intersection, SR 120/SR 360 head northward on Charles Hardy Parkway. Just over later, they meet SR 6 Business (Atlanta Highway). At Macland Road, SR 360 splits off to the southeast, while SR 120 continues to the northeast. A short distance later, it intersects SR 92 (Hiram Acworth Highway). Approximately later, the road enters Cobb County. Just before entering Marietta, the highway passes through Kennesaw Mountain National Battlefield Park. In the central part of the city, it intersects SR 5 and the western terminus of SR 120 Alternate (North Marietta Parkway NW). At this intersection, SR 5/SR 120 head to the southeast. About later, they intersect SR 360 (Powder Springs Street). Only a short distance later, the two routes split. To the southeast is Southern Polytechnic State University and then US 41/SR 3 (Cobb Parkway SE). A short distance later is an interchange with Interstate 75 (I-75). To the northeast, the highway meets the eastern terminus of both SR 3 Connector (Roswell Road) and SR 120 Alternate (North Marietta Parkway NE). It crosses over the Willeo Creek into Fulton County. In Roswell, it intersects SR 9 (South Atlanta Street), where they begin a concurrency to the northeast. In the central part of the city, they intersect the eastern terminus of SR 92 (East Crossville Road) and SR 140 (Holcomb Bridge Road). For about a block, SR 140 joins the concurrency, until it departs to the northwest on Houze Road. SR 9/SR 120 pass the North Fulton Hospital, just before entering Alpharetta. In the central part of the city, SR 9 departs to the north on South Main Street, while SR 120 heads eastward on Old Milton Parkway. Farther to the east is an interchange with US 19/SR 400 (Turner McDonald Parkway). In Johns Creek, it meets SR 141 (Medlock Bridge Road). The road crosses over the Chattahoochee River over the Abbotts Bridge and enters Gwinnett County and the Chattahoochee River National Recreation Area. In Duluth is an intersection with US 23/SR 13 (Buford Highway). The route continues to the southeast, until just before it meets I-85. Just before entering Lawrenceville, it meets the southern terminus of SR 317 (Lawrenceville Suwannee Road). Slightly to the southeast, is an interchange SR 316 (University Parkway). The city limits pass within the interchange. SR 120 continues to the southeast until it meets its eastern terminus, an intersection with US 29/SR 8, in the central part of the city. SR 120 has two sections that are included as part of the National Highway System, a system of roadways important to the nation's economy, defense, and mobility. They are: * From the western end of the concurrency with US 278/SR 6 in Dallas, then northeast into Marietta, to the eastern end of the concurrency with SR 5 * From the intersection with Sewell Mill Road NE, just northeast of Marietta, to its eastern terminus History From 1969 to 2007, SR 120 Loop looped around Marietta. In October 2007, SR 120 Loop was decommissioned, and mainline SR 120 was rerouted to the southern part of the loop. Prior to October 2007, mainline SR 120 ran through downtown Marietta and formed the southern part of Marietta Square. The portion of SR 120 from U.S. 41/SR 3 to SR 120 Alternate was renumbered SR 3 Connector. This was done at the same time changes were made to SR 5. Major intersections Special routes =Dallas‚ÄìHiram connector route= State Route 120 Connector (SR 120 Connector) exists within the south-central and southeastern parts of Paulding County. The route begins at an intersection with the SR 120 mainline (Buchanan Highway) southwest of Dallas, Georgia. It heads east as Scoggins Road to an intersection with SR 61 (Villa Rica Highway) At this intersection, the highway takes the name Hiram Sudie Road. It continues to the east and meets the Bill Carruth Parkway, before it reaches its eastern terminus, an intersection with SR 92 (Hiram Douglasville Highway) on the southwestern edge of Hiram. SR 120 Connector is not part of the National Highway System, a system of roadways important to the nation's economy, defense, and mobility. =Lost Mountain‚ÄìNew Hope connector route= State Route 120 Connector (SR 120 Conn.) was a connector route of SR 120 in Paulding County. The highway that would eventually become SR 120 Conn. was established at the end of 1940 as SR 176 from SR 6 in Hiram to SR 92 in New Hope. A portion of SR 176 just west of Lost Mountain had a \\"sand clay, top soil, or stabilized earth\\" surface. By the middle of 1950, a portion just west of Lost Mountain was hard surfaced. In 1953, a portion west of Lost Mountain had completed grading, but was not surfaced. By the middle of 1955, this entire segment of SR 176 had a sand clay, topsoil, or stabilized earth surface. About two years later, it was indicated to have a \\"topsoil or gravel, unpaved\\" surface. Between 1957 and 1960, it was paved. About a decade later, the segment of SR 176 between Lost Mountain and New Hope was shifted to the northeast. Its former alignment was redesignated as SR 92 Conn. In 1979, SR 92 Conn. was redesignated as SR 120 Conn. In 1983, SR 120 Conn. was decommissioned. =Marietta alternate route= State Route 120 Alternate (SR 120 Alt.) exists within the central and eastern parts of Marietta. It serves as the northern section of the Marietta Parkway. It begins at an intersection with the SR 120 mainline (Whitlock Avenue SW) in the central part of the city. At this intersection, SR 120 Alt. is concurrent with SR 5 north of the intersection. The two highways head north and curve to the east and meet US 41/SR 3 (Cobb Parkway SE). Here, SR 5 turns north onto Cobb Parkway, while SR 120 Alt. continues to the east on Marietta Parkway. The road meets an interchange with Interstate 75 (I-75) before curving to the southeast to meet its eastern terminus, an interchange with the eastern terminus of SR 3 Conn. (Roswell Road) and the SR 120 mainline. SR 120 Alt. is not part of the National Highway System, a system of roadways important to the nation's economy, defense, and mobility. The road that is now SR 120 used to be the northern half of SR 120 Loop, before that designation was decommissioned. =Marietta loop route= State Route 120 Loop (SR 120 Loop) was the former designation of the entire length of the Marietta Parkway, completely within the city limits of Marietta. As its name implies, it was a loop around the center of the city. These intersections start from the western meeting with the SR 120 mainline and proceed counterclockwise. As a loop, it did not have actual beginning or ending terminii.

Saba, M.G.S. Hodgson, The Encyclopaedia of Islam, Vol. I, ed. H. A. R. Gibb, J. H. Kramers, E. Levi-Provencal, J. Schacht, (Brill, 1986), 51. According to Sunni and Shia tradition, Abdullah bin Saba' was a Yemenite Jew from the Arab Himyar tribe who converted to Islam during Uthman's reign. Because of his exaggerated reverence for Ali, he is traditionally considered as the first of the ghulƒÅt. In accounts collected by Sayf ibn Umar, Ibn Saba' and his followers (the Saba'iyya) are said to be the ones who enticed the Egyptians against Uthman and were responsible for breaking the near-settlement at the Battle of the Camel. Modern historians differed on the historicity of Ibn Saba'. Some believe that Abdullah Ibn Saba and ibn al-SawdƒÅ æ should be considered as two separate individuals (Hodgson). Some have described him as semi-legendary or legendary (Taha Hussein, Bernard Lewis, Wilferd Madelung, Leone Caetani, and Shia historians) Others such as Israel Friedlander, Sabatino Moscati, and Sunni historians affirm his existence. His Jewish origin has also been contested. Some modern historians assert that Sayf ibn Umar fabricated the episode about the killing of Uthman to \\"exonerate the people of Medina from participation in the caliph's murder\\" and the movement to support Ali as a successor to Muhammad did not exist in the time of Uthman. With the exception of Taha Hussein, most modern Sunni writers affirm the existence of Ibn Saba'.  Historicity  According to traditional Sunni and Shia sources, Abdullah bin Saba' was a Yemenite Jewish convert to Islam. But modern historians differed on the historicity of Ibn Saba. M.G.S. Hodgson doubts that Ibn Saba' was a Jew, and suggests that Ibn Saba' and Ibn al-Sawada' should be considered as two separate individuals.Robert L. Canfield, Turko-Persia in Historical Perspective, Cambridge University Press, 2002, Page 159, According to Leone Caetani, Ibn Saba in origin was a purely political supporter of Ali, \\"around whom later generations imagined a religious conspiracy like that of the Abbasids\\". Taha Hussein and Ali al-Wardi maintain that Ibn Saba' was the creation of Umayyad propaganda. However, some historians affirm the existence of Ibn Saba' or his followers. Israel Friedlander concludes that Ibn Saba' and the Saba'iyya did, in fact, exist. His work has also been attested to by Sabatino Moscati. Linda D. Lau and A. R. Armush also accept Sayf ibn Umar's accounts and the role of the Saba'iyya at the Battle of the Camel. Concerning Ibn Saba' religious beliefs, particularly that of the Saba'iyya, W. F. Tucker noted that they are more complete and better recorded in sources devoted to heresiography. Matti Musa points out that the Saba'iyya as a ghulat sect did in fact exist, noting that their views have been seriously considered by both Sunni and Shia heresiographers. Hodgson states that there are contradictions in what religious views is ascribed to him and his followers, but we can assume that he was a founder or a hero of one or more sects called Saba æiyya, which exalted the position of Ali. Ancestry M. G. S. Hodgson concludes he was most likely not a Jew. W. F. Tucker suggests the possibility that the attribution of Jewish ancestry to Ibn Saba' on his paternal side and imputation of black descent on his mother's side, were fabricated to discredit his credentials as a Muslim Arab and \\"thus stigmatize all ideas associated with him\\". Bernard Lewis states that modern critical scholarship cast doubt on his Jewishness. Bernard Lewis, citing the example of Ibn Saba', states that there is tendency in Islamic sources to attribute subversive and extremist doctrines to Jewish origins, conspiracy or instigation. G. Levi Della Vida also rejects his Jewish origin and maintains that Ibn Saba' was an Arab. However, according to Hartwig Hirschfeld, Abdullah bin Saba' was a Jew from Yemen who embraced Islam.Jewish Encyclopedia; Abdallah ibn Saba. retrieved April 19, 2014 Israel Friedlander suggested that he may have been a son of an Ethiopian Falasha woman, which explains why he was called \\"ibn al-SawdƒÅ æ\\". W. F. Tucker, after examining the different arguments, concludes that \\"Whatever is the case regarding his ethnic identity, it is quite probable that Ibn Saba' was a Yemenite, and that he came from a Jewish milieu\\".  Ghulat  Traditionally, Abd Allah ibn Saba æ is considered as the first of the ghulƒÅt. He may have been the first to deny that Ali had died and predicted his return (raj øa), which was considered one form of ghul≈´. Also, the notion of the absence (ghayba) of an imam seem to have appeared first among the ghulƒÅt. Heinz Halm records him as a representative of a Ghulat group from the city of Seleucia-Ctesiphon (al-MadƒÅ'in) who came to see ‚ÄòAlƒ´ in K≈´fah. When Ibn Saba' proclaimed divinity, then ‚ÄòAlƒ´ denied this angrily and exiled him back to Seleucia-Ctesiphon.Heinz Halm, Shi'ism 2nd Edition p 155, (1987) 2004 Columbia University Press Heinz Halm adds that Islamic writers such as A≈° øari in MaqƒÅlƒÅt, Ba·∏°dƒÅdi in Feraq have said that Ibn Saba' was the first person who idolized Ali ibn Abi Talib. He preached that  øAli was God (al-elƒÅh). After  øAli‚Äôs death, he is said to maintain this idea that \\"a devil in  øAli‚Äôs appearance had been murdered\\" and  øAli had ascended to heaven and that his occultation (raj øa) was imminent.  Examining his roles in Uthman‚Äôs killing  According to M. G. S. Hodgson, \\"surer sources\\" than Tabari and Sayf ibn Umar seem to exclude Ibn Saba æ from playing any major role in the political events that led to Uthman's killing. Wilferd Madelung after reviewing the accounts of Sayf ibn Umar on the alleged role of Abdullah ibn Saba' in the rebellion against Uthman and emergence of Shi'a asserts \\"few if any modern historians would accept Sayf's legend of Ibn Saba‚Äô\\".The Succession to Muhammad p. 2 Taha Hussein asserts that the \\"fabrication\\" of ibn Saba' was done by the enemies of the Shias; that the insertion of a \\"Jewish element\\" would discredit the Shias. He noted that the absence of any record of ibn Saba' being present at the Battle of Siffin suggests that ibn Saba' is a fictitious person.al- Fitnat al-Kubra, Vol. II, p.90 Israel Friedlander, Julius Wellhausen, and most particularly, Leone Caetani, assert that Sayf fabricated the episode about killing of Uthman to \\"exonerate the people of Medina from participation in the caliph's murder\\" and as Friedlander adds finding a \\"scapegoat for the troubles surrounding Uthman\\" and any complicity in the strife resulting in the death of third caliph. Tucker asserts that although it may have been the case, there is no concrete evidence supporting this theory. They note that sources older than al-Tabari are silent on Ibn Saba' and his role in the agitation against Uthman. \\"They aver that the movement for supporting Ali as heir and testamentary trustee of the prophet did not exist in the time of Uthman as Ibn Saba' had alleged. Therefore they refuse to accept the authenticity of Ibn Saba's claim that Ali was the heir of prophet\\". Caetani noted that a religious conspiracy may have been created around the person of Ibn Saba æ even though he may have been just a political supporter of Ali. However, W. F. Tucker notes that the suggestion that Sayf is not reliable is no longer sustainable. Tucker and Landau-Tasseron point out that although Sayf may have been an unscrupulous hadith collector, this should not detract from his general reliability as a transmitter of historical information (akhbƒÅrƒ´). Tucker also states that even if Sayf's accounts of Ibn Saba' was a fabrication, he appears to be only the transmitter of the story and not the ultimate source. He adds that accusations of bias could equally be leveled at other akhbƒÅrƒ´s contemporary to Sayf, including the Shi'a historian Abu Mikhnaf. Moreover, Fuat Sezgin, Albrecht Noth, and Martin Hinds have also challenged Wellhausen's views and placed Sayf on an equal footing with other traditionalists. Linda D. Lau and A. R. Armush accept Sayf's accounts and the role of the Saba'iyya at the Battle of the Camel. They point out that traditionalists other than Sayf did not give an explanation to why the hostilities broke out after the near-settlement. Not only Sayf's account is the sole exiting account with an explanation of what happened, it is also logically consistent. Sunni views According to Tabari, based on traditions collected by Sayf ibn Umar, Ibn Saba' was a Yemenite Jew who embraced Islam. During the time of Ali ibn Abi Taleb, he introduced a number of concepts that later were ascribed to more extreme factions of Shia Islam, or ghulat. According to these traditions, the exaltation of Ali, his divine appointment by the Islamic prophet Muhammad as a successor, the concept of ghayba and return (raj øa) were first formulated and expressed by Ibn Saba æ and his followers (the Saba æiyya).Bibliography: Shatrastani al-Milal, pp. 132 et seq. (in Haarbr√ºcken's translation, i. 200-201); Weil, Gesch. der Chalifen, i. 173-174, 209, 259. He and his followers are sometimes said to be the ones who enticed the Egyptians against Uthman on the ground of Ali's special right of succession, and participated in further instigation at later conflicts. Historically, Sunni theologians have not only upheld Ibn Saba's existence, but used evidence from the historical works of the Shi'a in order to support their claims.Zubair Ali Zai, Who was Abdullah Ibn Saba? Birmingham: Maktabah Imaam Badee ud Deen, 2011. In Sunni polemics, Ibn Saba' plays the same role of seeking to destroy the message of Islam from within (by introducing proto-Shi'ite beliefs) as Paul would play in seeking to deliberately corrupt the early teachings of Jesus. Shia views In traditional Shia sources, Abdullah Ibn Saba' is viewed as an extremist (Ghali) that was cursed and killed by Ali bin Abi Talib (1st Shia Imam), and cursed by Ali ibn Husayn (4th Shia Imam), Muhammad al-Baqir (5th Shia Imam) and Ja'far al-Sadiq (6th Shia Imam).Rijal-e-Kashshi, Volume 1, Page 323 Nevertheless, Ibn Saba æ became the subject of a tradition used by different Shia factions to both attack and defend extreme Shia groups. According to these traditions, Ali first exiled him for declaring Ali as God and himself as prophet. But when he did not stop from his incorrect belief, Ali killed him and then burned his corpse.Al-Tamhid by Ibn 'Abd Al-Barr, V.5, P.317/ Also see page 305 Earliest Shia scholars also described Abdullah ibn Saba' as a real cursed person who only believed that Ali is God and himself is prophet. Shia scholars such as Abu Muhammad al-Hasan bin Musa al-Nawbakhti,Book Firaq al- Shi'a: Nubakhti, pp.43,44 Abu Amr bin Abdul Aziz al-Kash-shi,Rijaal al-Kash- shi: Abu 'Amr bin Abdul Aziz al-Kash-shi, p.101 al-Mamaqaani, author of \\"Tanqeeh al-Maqaal\\", who is an authoritative Shi'i biogrophist quoted the like in his said book, p.184 Al-Hasan bin Ali al-Hilly,Kitaab al-Rijaal: al-Hilly, p.469, printed in Tehran, Iran 1383 h. From Ash-Shi'a wat-Tashayyu', p.56 al- Astra Abadi,Manhaj al-Maqaal: al-Astar Abadi, p.203, from: Ash-Ashia wat- Tashayyu', p.56Al-Sadooq,Man la yahduruhu al-Faqih1/229 and Al-Nawbakhty. page 19-20. talked about the stories and narrations of Ibn Saba. Al-Maamiqaaniy was asserted the existence of Abdullah ibn Saba'Tanqiihul-Maqaal fii ‚ÄòIlmir- Rijaal, 2/183-184 It is narrated different traditions from Shia Imams in the book Rijal al-Kashshi about the belief of Abdullah bin Saba' (i.e. divinity of Ali and prophethood of himself), and also cursing of him by different Shia Imams. One such example includes: After narrating the traditions of Shia Imams which say that Abdullah ibn Saba was a cursed person who believed that Ali is God, about him, Rijal al-Kashshi says: Shia scholars have said that \\"Some knowledgeable people\\" in the saying of Kashshi refers to those Sunni scholars that wrongly attributed the founding of Shia beliefs to Abdullah ibn Saba', based on the invented tales of Sayf bin Umar about whom Sunni eminent scholars like Al-Dhahabi, Haakim, Ibn Habban, etc. have said that was a hadith fabricator, liar and also a Zindeeq (Atheist).Naqd Kitab Usool Al-Madhahib Al- Shi'ah, by Seyyed Muhammad Al-Husaini Al-Qazwini, Volume 1 Al-Maamqaani from his work Tanqih al-Maqaal Fi Ilm al-Rijaal (2/183-184): From Sa'd bin Abdullah al-Ash'ari al-Qummi who was speaking of the Sab'iyyah (in al-Maqaalaat wal- Firaq p. 20): Regarding to this saying of Sa'd bin Abdullah al-Ash'ari al- Qummi, Shia scholars say that he did not mention any chain of authorities nor did he mention from whom (or which book) he got the story and what his source was. Moreover, al-Ash‚Äôari al-Qummi has narrated many traditions from Sunni authorities. al-Najjashi (d. 450) in his \\"al-Rijal‚Äùsaid that al-Ash‚Äôari al- Qummi traveled to many places and was well known for his relation with Sunni historians and heard many stories from them.Reijal Al-Najjashi, Page 177 So, he surely wrote this report from what he heard from Sunnis, which was indeed based on the stories of Sayf bin Umar. Ni'matullah al-Jazaa'iree, another of Shi'ite famous scholars from his book al-Anwaar al-Nu'maaniyyah (2/234): The first part of the saying of Ni'matullah al-Jazaa'iree is the Shia belief about Abdullah ibn Saba which is based on the authentic traditions. But the second part of his saying ( i.e., And it is said that he was a Jew who accepted Islam ... ) is about the story which was made by Sayf ibn Umar. Usually, in Islamic books, using from the term 'ŸÇŸäŸÑ' ( Ghila, i.e., It is said ... ) before mentioning a matter by the author, implies the belief of the author about the weakness of the saying which is mentioned after it. So, using the term 'Ghila' by Ni'matullah al-Jazaa'iree shows that he believed that the saying is weak.Lillahi wa Lil-Haqiqah, by Ali Aal Mohsin, Volume 1, Page 45 Famous Shia scholar Nau Bakhti writes, Muhammad Ali al-Mual'lim, a present-day Shi'ite, also affirmed the existence of Abdullah bin Saba' in his book Abdullah bin Saba: The Unknown Reality. This book was a refutation of those who denied the existence of Abdullah bin Saba' giving the excuse of \\"false narrations\\". Modern Shia historians often cite a number of Sunni scholars who considered Sayf ibn Umar as unreliable on matters of prophetic hadith. For example, al- Dhahabi (d. 748 AH) has quoted from the book of Sayf in his History, but wrote in \\"al-Mughni fi al-Dhu'afa'\\" that: \\"Sayf has two books which have been unanimously abandoned by the scholars.\\"al-Mughni fi al-Dhu'afa', by al- Dhahabi, p292 They point out to a number of prominent Sunni scholars concur regarding his narration of hadith. *Yahya Ibn Mueen (d. 233 AH) wrote: \\"Sayf's narrations are weak and useless.\\" *Abu Hatam (d. 277 AH) wrote: \\"Sayf's Hadith is rejected.\\" * Ibn Abi Hatam (d. 327 AH) wrote: \\"Scholars have abandoned Sayf's narrations.\\" * Ibn Habban (d. 354 AH) wrote: \\"Sayf attributed fabricated traditions to the good reporters. He was accused of being a heretic and a liar.\\" * Ibn al-Sakan (d. 353 AH) wrote: \\"Sayf is weak.\\" * Ibn Udei (d. 365 AH) wrote about Sayf: \\"He is weak. Some of his narrations are famous yet the majority of his narrations are disgraceful and not followed.\\" *al- Darqutini (d. 385 AH) wrote: \\"Sayf is weak\\". *Ibn Abd al-Barr (d. 462 AH) mentioned in his writing about al-Qa'qa: \\"Sayf reported that al-Qa'qa Said: I attended the death of the Prophet Muhammad.\\" Ibn Adb al-Barr continued: \\"Ibn Abu Hatam said: Sayf is weak. Thus, what was conveyed of the presence of al- Qa'qa at the death of the Prophet is rejected. We mentioned the Sayf's traditions for knowledge only.\\" *Firuzabadi (d. 817 AH) in \\"Towalif\\" mentioned Sayf and some others by saying: \\"They are weak.\\" *Ibn Hajar al-Asqalani (d. 852 AH) wrote after mentioning a tradition: \\"Many reporters of this tradition are weak, and the weakest among them is Sayf.\\" *Safi al-Din (d. 923 AH) wrote: \\"Sayf is considered weak.\\" including al-Hakim,al-Hakim (d. 405 AH) wrote: \\"Sayf is accused of being a heretic. His narrations are abandoned.\\" Abu Dawud,Abu Dawud (d. 316 AH) wrote: \\"Sayf is nothing. He was a liar. Some of his Hadiths were conveyed and the majority of them are denied.\\" al-Suyutial- Suyuti (d. 900 AH) wrote: \\"Sayf's Hadith is weak.\\" and al-Nisa'i.al-Nisa'i (d. 303 AH) wrote: \\"Sayf's narrations are weak and they should be disregarded because he was unreliable and untrustworthy.\\" However, some modern historians have pointed out that this view of Sayf should be limited to his hadith scholarship, and thus it does not detract from his general reliablitiy as a transmitter of historical information. But this is not acceptable. Because when he used to make many fake traditions, so that logically he used to make fake tales and then narrate them as historical stories. Other sources Tabari narration on Ibn Saba' goes back to Sayf ibn Umar. There are two other historians that mentioned Ibn Saba' accounts which is said to have independent sources. However, it can be shown that their chains of isnad go back to Sayf Ibn Umar. There is a favorable Isma'ili legend that formed around the figure of Abdullah ibn Saba.

It is named for Jacob Wetterling, a Minnesota eleven-year-old who was abducted by a stranger in 1989, and was missing for almost 27 years until his death was confirmed when his remains were found on September 1, 2016. The law, enacted as part of the Federal Violent Crime Control and Law Enforcement Act of 1994, requires states to form registries of offenders convicted of sexually violent offenses or offenses against children, and to form more rigorous registration requirements for sex offenders. States must also verify the addresses of sex offenders annually for at least ten years, and those offenders classified as sexually violent predators must verify their addresses quarterly for the rest of their lives. The Wetterling Act required state compliance by September 1997, with a two-year extension for good faith efforts to achieve compliance; non-compliance would result in a 10% reduction of federal block grant funds for criminal justice. Under this law, states had discretion to disseminate registration information to the public, but dissemination was not required. Congress amended the Wetterling Act in 1996 with Megan‚Äôs Law, requiring law enforcement agencies to release information about registered sex offenders that law enforcement deems relevant to protecting the public. Also passed by Congress in 1996 was the Pam Lychner Sexual Offender Tracking and Identification Act. This act requires the Federal Bureau of Investigation (FBI) to establish a national database of sex offenders to assist local enforcement agencies in tracking sex offenders across state lines. The Wetterling Act was amended for the final time in 1998 with Section 115 of the General Provisions of Title I of the Departments of Commerce, Justice and State, the Judiciary, and Related Agencies Appropriations Act (CJSA). The CJSA amendment provided for greater discretion among states for procedures used for contacting registered offenders to keep their addresses updated. Also, the CJSA required offenders to register in a state other than their own if they were there for school, and required federal and military employees to register in their state of residence.

Membership is an honour extended to Freemasons by invitation. The Grand Lodge of the Royal Order of Scotland is headquartered in Edinburgh, with a total of 88 subordinate Provincial Grand Lodges; of these, the greatest concentration (more than a third) is in the British Isles, with the rest located in countries around the world. Organization Breast Star of a member of the Royal Order of Scotland. The order claims the King of Scots as hereditary Grand Master. The Deputy Grand Master and Governor of the order is currently Sir Archibald Donald Orr-Ewing, 6th Baronet (b. 20 December 1938). Orr-Ewing is the eldest son of Sir Ronald Archibald Orr-Ewing, 5th Baronet and was educated at Gordonstoun and Trinity College, Dublin. He was the Grand Master Mason of the Grand Lodge of Antient, Free and Accepted Masons of Scotland, until 27 November 2008, a post he held since 2005. He previously held the post between 1999 and 2004, being the only person to hold that office twice. He was installed as Deputy Grand Master & Governor (the administrator) of the Royal Order of Scotland at Edinburgh on 3 July 2009. In times in which there is no King of Scots, the Deputy Grand Master and Governor is the worldwide leader of the Order. Each Provincial Grand Lodge has a Provincial Grand Master, who usually governs for a number of years consecutively. The Provincial Grand Master will appoint Provincial officers annually. Uniquely within Freemasonry, the Royal Order of Scotland has no local (or 'private') Lodges, and the Provincial Grand Lodge is the lowest tier of organisation and activity. New members are admitted in a Provincial Grand Lodge, or even in the Grand Lodge in Edinburgh. In London (but not elsewhere in England) the Order is administered at the Provincial level from Mark Masons' Hall, and the officers of the Provincial Grand Lodge of London and Metropolitan Counties are selected largely from amongst the senior members of the various other Orders administered from that building. Ceremonies The regalia of the Royal Order of Scotland, as worn by a Chaplain of the Order. The Royal Order of Scotland's Grand Lodge and the Provincial Grand Lodges confer two degrees: *Heredom of Kilwinning *Knight of the Rosy Cross The ceremonies are usually learnt and rehearsed without scripts, and they include a considerable amount of rhyming verse. Elements of many other Masonic degrees and orders are incorporated into, or referenced within, the Royal Order of Scotland ceremonies. History The order has existed since at least 1741, based on records in the archive of the Grand Lodge demonstrating activity in London, with a further charter being granted in 1750 to work the degree at The Hague. The holder of that warrant, William Mitchell, moved to Edinburgh around 1752/3, using the charter to establish a Provincial Grand Lodge there. In 1767 this body became the Grand Lodge of the Royal Order of Scotland. Activity appears to have dwindled, with the Order nearing extinction in the early 19th century, but a resurgence culminated in the establishment of further Provincial Grand Lodges by 1843. The legends of the order date its origination to the reign of King David I in the 12th century in the Heredom degree, with the Rosy Cross degree originating in 1314 following the Battle of Bannockburn. Membership The position of the Royal Order of Scotland among the Masonic appendant bodies in England and Wales The essential and universal qualifications for applicants are membership of the three degrees of Craft Freemasonry, five years or more continuous subscription to a St John's Lodge as a Master Mason, and profession of the Trinitarian Christian faith. These requirements cannot be altered by any Province. In addition to these fundamental requirements, Provinces are free to impose additional conditions, and many do so, the most common being the requirement of membership of the Holy Royal Arch. Further qualifications for membership vary by provincial jurisdiction but may include a requirement of active membership of the 18th degree of the Ancient and Accepted Scottish Rite or one of the other Christian Masonic Orders (such as Red Cross of Constantine, or Knights Templar). In the United States candidates should hold the 32nd degree of the Ancient and Accepted Scottish Rite, or be a Knight Templar within the York Rite system.

The 2011 Census recorded the parish's population as 1,648. History The village is one of three named after the ancient forest of Wychwood. The others are Shipton-under-Wychwood immediately to the east of the village and Ascott- under-Wychwood about away. In the 18th century Milton had its own clockmaker, William Green (1722‚Äì70). The Church of England parish church of St. Simon and St. Jude was designed by the Gothic Revival architect G.E. Street and built in 1853‚Äì54. Street also designed the village school (now closed) and teacher's house, which were built at the same time. Amenities and economy The Quart Pot public house in 2006 The village has one public house, The Hare, which is a gastropub.The Hare For many years it was the Quart Pot pub, latterly controlled by Greene King Brewery, which closed it in 2010. The brewery sold the pub, and Acres Developments of Bournemouth, Dorset, applied for planning permission to turn the pub into a house. Villagers opposed the conversion and in 2012 West Oxfordshire District Council refused to grant planning permission. Eventually two local entrepreneurs bought the pub in 2015, renovated the building and in March 2016 reopened it as The Hare. Wychwood public library is in a converted shop in the village. The village has a Co- Operative shop. Shipton railway station on the Cotswold Line is away. Milton Stone is a type of Cotswold stone that has been quarried in the area since the early 14th century. It was used at St George's Chapel, Windsor (1478-83) and Christ Church, Oxford (1525), but was not thereafter used at Oxford until 1850.

It was aimed at seven- to 14-year-olds and was promoted heavily with trailers shown on Children's BBC. Circulation started at 210,000 copies per week, reached a peak of 340,000 in March 1990, but fell to 150,000 by Spring 1991. Fast Forward generally sold around 40% to 50% more copies than Look-in on a weekly basis. Format The centre pages of Fast Forward magazine usually included a pull out poster. This would often be of television celebrities of the time, although on one occasion an edition was sold with 3-D glasses and a 3-D anaglyphic poster of New York. The magazine usually contained a number of cartoon scripts of celebrities and presenters who appeared on Children's BBC, such as Jimmy Savile and Andi Peters. It also regularly contained material relating to Edd the Duck and Gordon the Gopher, as well as an EastEnders-based comic strip. In September 1990, the BBC also relaunched the Number One pop music magazine aimed mainly at girls. In early 1992, the Number One magazine was incorporated into Fast Forward. At the start, the magazine only covered BBC programmes, but from March 1991 it also covered ITV and C4 ‚Äì it was able to do so due to the deregulation of the TV listings market.

Biography Reuben Ship was born in 1915 to Sam and Bella Davis Ship in Plateau Mt. Royal, a neighborhood of Montreal with a high immigrant population. Despite an early illness that left him sickly throughout his life, he was able to complete his secondary education and attend McGill University in Montreal to study English literature. Upon his graduation in 1939, he began directing an amateur theater company affiliated with the local YMHA and YWHA. Many of these plays were anti-fascist and were intended to raise money for the war effort. It was at this theater group that Ship met his first wife, Ada Span. Ship soon took control of another amateur theater group known as the New Theater Group, with Ada assisting him. Because this troupe typically put on leftist plays, they often found themselves under the surveillance of the \\"Red Squad\\" of the Qu√©bec Provincial Police. Ship's most successful effort during that time was We Beg To Differ, a musical revue with lyrics by Ship and music by Mel Tolkin which poked fun at numerous Canadian political figures of the time. By this time Ship had begun touring the northeastern United States, and he eventually settled in New York City. In 1944 he was hired by NBC as a scriptwriter for a new radio sitcom, The Life of Riley. When the show was adapted for television in 1949-50, however, Ship's contract had expired and he was not rehired. HUAC Investigation On July 31, 1951, Ship was informed by the U.S. Immigration and Naturalization Service that his immigration status was under review, likely because two fellow members of the Radio Writers' Guild had named him as a Communist. Called before the House Un-American Activities Committee on September 24 of that year, he claimed that the government had no right to question him about his beliefs, at which he was labeled an uncooperative witness and subsequently dismissed. Eighteen months later, on January 12, 1953, he was deported to his native Canada, where he settled in Toronto and got jobs at an advertising agency and writing radio programming for the CBC, including The Night Before Christmas and The Man Who Liked Christmas. both in 1953. The Investigator On May 30, 1954, Ship's most important work, The Investigator, premiered. With the Army-McCarthy Hearings having been on television in America for two months, Joseph McCarthy's methods of investigating Communist infiltration in the U.S. Army fascinated the public, and were a topic for heated debate. No doubt bitter about his own deportation and blacklisting, Ship crafted a satire of this process, along with its ringleader. The Investigator concerns a senator who shares many of McCarthy's mannerisms dying in a plane crash and arriving at the gates of heaven, where a tribunal must decide whether he is bound for heaven or hell. The cunning senator commandeers the tribunal and promptly begins rooting out subversives from \\"up here\\" and sending them \\"down there,\\" creating chaos among the residents of hell. Ultimately, in his hubris, he accuses God Himself of being a subversive, at which the Senator is banished to hell, where not even Satan himself will have him. The Investigator proved to be tremendously popular, and bootleg copies began circulating throughout the United States and Canada. The BBC aired it in 1955, and the Australian Broadcasting Commission requested permission to air it as well. Despite this success, however, Ship decided to pursue his advertising career. In 1956 he moved to England. Career in England Ship did not find great success in advertising, so he soon returned to scriptwriting. He contributed to episodes of the British show My Wife's Sister, and it is speculated that he provided scripts to American networks under a pseudonym as well. He scripted two films, There Was a Crooked Man and The Girl on the Boat. By this point, his marriage to Ada Span had failed, and in 1960 he married another Canadian television personality, Elaine Grand. He wrote many more radio programs throughout his career, and oversaw a stage production of his play The Taxman Cometh for the CBC in 1969. He lived in England until his death in 1975.

It is used in organic production of foodstuff, as well as in other situations in which the introduction of toxins is undesirable. Instead of the use of synthetic toxins, pest control is achieved by biological means. Some examples of Non-Pesticidal Management techniques include: * Introduction of natural predators. * Use of naturally occurring insecticides, such as Neem tree products,http://www.ecotippingpoints.org/our-stories/indepth/india-pest- management-nonpesticide-neem.html Margosa, Tulsi / Basil Leaf, Citrus Oil, Eucalyptus Oil, Onion, Garlic spray, Essential Oils. These also refer to as Organic Pesticides. * Use of trap crops which attract the insects away from the fields. The trap crops are regularly checked and pests are manually removed. * Pest larvae which were killed by viruses can be crushed and sprayed over fields, thus killing the remaining larvae. * Field sanitation. * Timely sowing. * Nutrient management. * Maintain proper plant population. * Go for soil solarisation. * Deep summer ploughing. Over years insects have withstood natural calamities and survived successfully. They are able to develop resistance to chemical pesticides insecticides used by farmers. To be successful, farmers should be knowledgeable and able to identify various crop pests, and their natural enemies (farmer‚Äôs friendly insects). Farmers should recognize different stages of insects and their behavior. The efforts to minimize pests should aim at restoring the natural balance of insects in crop ecosystem but not elimination of the pest. Principles of NPM ;Encouraging natural process in environment:Crop ecosystem should be diverse by growing inter crops, trap crops, border crops in place of mono cropping. Once the insecticide sprays stopped, natural enemies of crop pests gradually establish and exercise control of crop pests, which can be enhanced with botanical extracts like NSKE, chilli garlic extract, cattle dung urine decoction etc. ;Herbal repellents Soberbio Veto contributing lot towards natural process of repelling pest and helping environment ;Management skill:Selecting crop based on soil, water resources, climate and local pest problems that occur regularly, crop rotation, adjustment of sowing dates to avoid endemic pests, setting up light and pheromone traps, keeping sticky traps and bird perches. ;Local resources:Using locally available organic amendments for soil improvement and pest control. The extracts are prepared and used as prophylactic or curative measures aimed to restore the disturbed natural balance. ;Labor:Shunning chemical inputs and out of shelf products farmer should invest his labor as main investment like regular monitoring of the crop and following methods like deep summer ploughing and shaking plants to dislodge pod borers in pigeonpea. ;Community approach:Pest problem of a farmer not only depends on the crop and management practices of one farmer in isolation. To a large extent it depends on crops cultivated by neighboring farmers and measures taken by them. Hence, identification of activities that necessitate group action and implementing them would be most important aspect in NPM /sustainable agriculture. References *G.V.

Family background Turki‚Äôs father was Abdullah bin Muhammad, who was himself the son of Muhammad bin Saud (founder of the First Saudi State) and the younger brother of Abdulaziz.Winder 1965, p. 60. This made Turki the first cousin once removed of Abdullah bin Saud, the latter being both Abdulaziz's grandson and the last ruling Imam of the First State.Winder 1965, p. 279 Ascent Turki fought in the defense of Diriyah against the Egyptians and escaped when this city was seized by Ibrahim Pasha in 1818, marking the end of the First Saudi State Winder 1965, p. 52. He spent the next two years in hiding due to the ensuing persecution of the Al Saud with Abdullah bin Saud being sent to Cairo and then, to ƒ∞stanbul to be executed by the Ottomans. Turki briefly collaborated with Mohammad bin Mishari bin Muammar, an Arab client of Muhammad Ali, who aspired to rule Najd himself. However, when Mishari bin Saud, the last Imam‚Äôs brother, escaped from Egyptian captivity to reassert Saudi rule, Turki joined him and was appointed governor of Riyadh.Winder 1965, p. 64. Ibn Muammar quickly crushed the revolt, however, and imprisoned Mishari. Turki retaliated by capturing Ibn Muammar and his son (also named Mushari). An attempt to exchange both men for Mishari bin Saud before the latter was returned to Egyptian custody failed, resulting in the execution of Ibn Muammar and his son. Turki was then forced back into hiding. By this time, many senior members of the House of Saud had been killed, exiled, or imprisoned, leaving Turki as one of the few within the family willing and able to assume leadership.Winder 1965, pp. 54-55 Reign In 1823, Turki reemerged to form an alliance with Sawaid, the ruler of Jalajil in Sudair, and had soon established himself in Irqah. He made further incursions into Najd, in which he seized major settlements such as Durma and Manfuhah in order to isolate Riyadh and its Egyptian garrison.Winder 1965, pp. 60-63 By August 1824, Riyadh itself came under siege and fell a few months later; Turki designated Riyadh as the new Saudi capital as Diriyah had been devastated and largely depopulated by the Egyptians during their occupation.Winder 1965, p. 64 Though he had succeeded in reestablishing a viable Saudi polity, Turki chose to remain a nominal vassal of the Ottomans due to what had happened to Abdullah bin Saud. This in no way inhibited his attempts over the next several years to consolidate his hold in Najd, with Kharj, Qasim, and Jabal Shammar all having submitted to Saudi rule by 1828 despite clashes with the local Bedouin.Winder 1965, pp. 64-65Winder 1965, pp. 68-69 With Hejaz and the Red Sea remaining in Egyptian hands, further expansion was directed eastwards. The conquest of the Eastern Province was achieved in 1830, in response to a Bedouin invasion from this region led by the Banu Khalid.Winder 1965, pp. 75-78 Efforts to extend Saudi influence along the Persian Gulf littoral, however, met with mixed success. The mere threat of invasion was enough to subdue Oman in 1833 yet Bahrain revolted in the same year (having agreed to pay tribute three years prior), a situation that remained unresolved at the time of Turki‚Äôs death. Assassination In spite of his success in returning the House of Saud to power, Turki could not avoid falling victim to familial intrigue. On 9 May 1834, as the imam was leaving the mosque, he was ambushed and slain by three assassins working for his cousin (and fellow member of the House of Saud) Mishari bin Abdul Rahman.Winder, 1965, p. 94 It was Mishari who then emerged ‚Äúwith an unsheathed sword‚Äù, insisting that he, and not Faisal (who was away on campaign against Bahrain), was the new imam. Faisal, however, quickly learned of his father's assassination and hurried back to Riyadh. He reached this city by the end of May, defeating and executing Mishari within a matter of weeks. Yet this was only a partial victory as it would take almost a decade of fighting against other would-be usurpers before Faisal succeeded in establishing his authority as Turki‚Äôs successor. Legacy The Second Saudi State would endure until 1891. In addition, Turki was the progenitor of four branches of the House of Saud: *The Al Faisal- through his son and successor Faisal; this is the branch to which the present line of Saudi monarchs belongs. According to the Library of Congress, it contained several thousand male descendants of Turki by the late twentieth century. *The Al TurkiKechichian 2001, pp. 33‚Äì34.\\\\- through his youngest son Abdullah bin Turki. *The Al Jiluwi- through his son Jiluwi who was born while Turki was in exile.

Founded in 1967, it has headquarters in the Toronto area, and operations in New York City and Los Angeles. As of December 2019, there were 1,624 IMAX theatres located in 81 countries, of which 1,529 were in commercial multiplexes. These include IMAX variations such as IMAX 3D, IMAX Dome, and Digital IMAX. The CEO is Richard Gelfond. History IMAX is a Canadian corporation that is based in Mississauga, Ontario. The company was founded in 1967 when three filmmakers, Graeme Ferguson, Roman Kroitor and Robert Kerr incorporated IMAX Corporation. The idea and the new technology, which resulted in the birth of the company, came from the work that Ferguson, Kroitor and Kerr had done producing the multi-screen National Film Board of Canada production In the Labyrinth and Ferguson's Man and the Polar Regions for Expo 67. From their experience, Graeme Ferguson, Roman Kroitor and Robert Kerr realized that new technology would be necessary to develop a larger and more complex project than previously seen. As a result, they sought an engineer named William Shaw in 1968 (he had gone to Galt Collegiate Institute in Galt, Ontario, now Cambridge, with Ferguson and Kerr) to help develop this technology. Shaw created this new projector that allowed for films to have exceptionable quality and to be ten times larger than conventional 35mm picture frames. The first movie IMAX Corporation produced using this new technology was Tiger Child which was featured at Expo '70 in Osaka, Japan. It was because of the multi-screen viewing that Graeme Ferguson, Roman Kroitor and Robert Kerr wanted to create a theatre with giant screens, surround sound and stadium seating. William Shaw was instrumental in helping IMAX Corporation fulfill its ambitions in creating larger and more realistic experiences for audience which included oversized screens, surround sound and steep seating for better viewing. Shaw remained at IMAX (although officially retired) as a designer and inventor until his passing on August 31, 2002 at the age of 73. Before retiring Shaw created a 3D camera which was sent to the International Space Station for IMAX films. In 1994, investment bankers Gelfond and Bradley Wechsler, acquired IMAX Corporation through a leveraged buyout and publicly listed the company on the NASDAQ stock exchange. IMAX then began to focus their abilities on attracting Hollywood production houses. Another engineer at IMAX Corporation Brian Bonnick, Chief Technology Officer at IMAX Corporation, developed technologies that made it possible for the worldwide IMAX to produce major Hollywood films. More flexible technology required by that industry led to the development of the IMAX DMR (Digital Re-Mastering), which was able to adapt quickly in various locations. Newer technology followed, including the IMAX Experience and the IMAX MPX theatre system. Revamped IMAX 2D footage has been transferred into IMAX 3D. =Recent milestones= * In April 2009, Gelfond became the sole IMAX CEO and Wechsler moved into the role of chairman of the board of directors. * Later in 2009, IMAX participated in the movie Avatar, to which the company credits its mainstream Hollywood success. * In March 2011 IMAX noted that China's Wanda Cinema Line announced a 75-theatre deal with IMAX Corporation. * In 2012, IMAX opened its first location in Tianjin, China. * On October 8, 2015, IMAX China, a subsidiary of the company, was listed on the Hong Kong Stock Exchange. According to The Hollywood Reporter and The Wall Street Journal, \\"IMAX China raised $248 Million in its initial public offering,\\" which was the \\"bottom of [the] indicative price range.\\" * , there were 1,624 theatres in 81 countries and territories.  Co- productions  In November 2016, Marvel Television and IMAX announced the live action television series, Marvel's Inhumans, based on the superhero race of the same name. The series, co-produced with ABC Studios, saw IMAX serve as a financing partner, a first for IMAX, which allowed Marvel to spend more on the series than it had on its other television series, especially for visual effects. The entire series was filmed with IMAX digital cameras. Inhumans debuted an edited specific for theatrical-release version of the first two episodes. The episodes debuted on IMAX screens in theaters worldwide in September 2017, with the series airing weekly on ABC afterwards. After the poor reception to the IMAX version of the first two episodes and a box office gross of $3.5 million, Richard Gelfond said, \\"Going forward, we intend to take a more conservative approach consistent with the Game of Thrones approach to capital investments and content. We will be more conservative when considering whether to invest our own capital; and if so, to what extent.\\"  See also  * 3net References External links * IMAX Corporation Category:3D imaging Category:Technology companies established in 1967 Category:Companies formerly listed on the Toronto Stock Exchange Category:Companies listed on the New York Stock Exchange Category:Photography companies of Canada Category:Movie theatre chains in the United States Category:Entertainment companies established in 1967 Category:1967 establishments in Quebec Category:Companies based in Mississauga Category:Recipients of the Scientific and Technical Academy Award of Merit ","title":"IMAX Corporation"},{"id":"3888448","text":"Soraya Raquel Lamilla Cuevas (March 11, 1969 ‚Äì May 10, 2006) was a Colombian- American singer/songwriter, guitarist, arranger and record producer. A successful Colombian music star, she had two number-one songs on Billboard's Latin Pop Airplay charts. She won a 2004 Latin Grammy Award for \\"Best Album by Songwriter\\" for the self-titled album Soraya , which she produced, and received a 2005 Latin Grammy Award nomination for \\"Female Pop Vocal Album\\" for her album El Otro Lado de Mi (literally \\"The Other Side of Me\\"). She was the opening act for the 2005 Billboard Latin Music Awards. Her career spanned ten years, and she recorded five albums. Soraya died on May 10, 2006 following a long struggle against breast cancer. Biography =Early life= Soraya Raquel Lamilla Cuevas was born in Point Pleasant, New Jersey, a year after her father, mother, and brother moved to the United States from their native Colombia. The family moved back to Colombia when she was a baby, but when Soraya was eight years old, they returned to New Jersey.\\"Singer of the Week: Soraya\\" , AskMen.com, 2005 \\"Soraya\\" is a common name in the Middle East, and its meaning can be translated as \\"Pleiades\\". Soraya's maternal relatives were Lebanese Christians who emigrated from Lebanon to Colombia. Achy Obejas,\\"Soraya survivor\\" , Cuerpo Magazine, 2005 Soraya's mother, Yamila Cuevas Gharib, had been a housewife in Colombia. Soraya's father, Gregorio Lamilla, worked for an exporting company in Colombia. In the U.S., life was hard for the family, so to make ends meet, he worked three or four jobs. Soraya first became interested in music at age 5 when she heard her uncle playing music in Colombia. He played \\"Pueblito Viejo\\", a Colombian traditional folk song using an instrument called the tiple, which is a kind of guitar with triple strings. Her parents bought her a guitar, which she taught herself how to play. She became proficient in classical violin, and her first public performance was at Carnegie Hall in New York City as a member of the N.Y.C. Youth Philharmonic. She was valedictorian of her class at Point Pleasant Boro High School, where she began writing her own music.Zedalis, Joe. \\"Soraya stood out at Point Borough and around world\\", Asbury Park Press, May 14, 2006. Accessed February 27, 2011. \\"The Point Pleasant Borough High School graduate and Latin Grammy Award winner whose fight against breast cancer raised awareness about the disease in the Latino community died Wednesday in Miami said a spokeswoman for her record label EMI Latin said...\\" Soraya was 12 years old when her mother was first diagnosed with breast cancer, 18 when her mother had a recurrence, and 22 when her mother died in 1992. Soraya said that her sense of responsibility increased because she needed to take care of her mother and do all the household chores. She would also accompany her mother to the doctor's office; together they did breast-cancer research and participated in the Race for the Cure. Soraya attended Rutgers University in New Jersey, where she studied English literature, French philosophy, and women's studies. Initially, she worried that she might be too shy to play before big crowds, but she eventually triumphed over her fear and realized her tremendous talent as a live performer when she played to rapt audiences at coffee houses and rallies around the sprawling Rutgers campus. She worked as a flight attendant before starting her music career. =Musical career= Soraya obtained a record contract with Polygram Records/Island Records in 1994. Her first album, released two years later simultaneously in both English and Spanish, was titled On nights like this / En esta noche. Both versions received positive critical acclaim and enabled her to tour in the U.S., Latin America and Europe, as a guest performer in concerts for musicians such as Natalie Merchant, Zucchero, Sting, Michael Bolton and Alanis Morissette. Her songs climbed to the top of the charts in the Latin American, European, and U.S. Hispanic markets. Her first single, \\"Suddenly/De Repente\\", reached #1 in Billboard Latin Pop listings, with the English version receiving some mainstream Adult Contemporary airplay. Her second album, Torre de marfil / Wall of smiles, titled after a song co-written with her idol Carole King, was released in late 1997, and helped her attain worldwide recognition. In 2000, Soraya was diagnosed with Stage III breast cancer, shortly after the release of her third album Cuerpo y alma / I'm yours ‚Äî just days before she was about to tour and promote it. She took time off to fight the illness. Feeling healthy and in remission, Soraya returned to the music scene in 2003 with the release of her fourth and self-titled album, Soraya. The songs reflected her struggles, beliefs and love for life. She composed, produced, and arranged the album, which won the Latin Grammy for \\"Best Album by a Singer-Songwriter\\". She created one more successful album, El otro lado de m√≠, before dying from cancer in 2006. =Death= Soraya died of breast cancer in Miami, Florida on May 10, 2006, aged 37. She was first diagnosed in 2000, at the age of 31, after finding a lump while conducting a routine self-examination. She was diagnosed at Stage III and had a double mastectomy and breast reconstruction as well as radiation therapy and chemotherapy. Soraya had also lost her mother, a grandmother, and a maternal aunt to breast cancer. =Breast cancer advocate= Soraya was an advocate of breast cancer support and education, especially for Hispanic women. She became the first Latin spokesperson for the Susan G. Komen Breast Cancer Foundation, touring the Americas to raise awareness. During September and October, she took a break from her music career to focus on breast cancer awareness. In order to encourage other women, Soraya wrote and recorded \\"No one else/Por ser quien soy\\", a song that reflects her experience in fighting breast cancer.

Biography She was born in Waterford, Ireland, a granddaughter of Lucien Bonaparte (making her Emperor Napoleon I's great-niece) by his second wife, through the marriage of his daughter Letizia to Sir Thomas Wyse, an Irishman, British plenipotentiary at Athens, and Member of Parliament. However, she was born after her mother had been separated from Wyse for three years, and her biological father was British Army officer Captain Studholme John Hodgson.D. G. Paz, ‚ÄòWyse, Sir Thomas (1791‚Äì1862)‚Äô, Oxford Dictionary of National Biography, Oxford University Press, 2004; online edn, Jan 2008 accessed 7 Nov 2011 She was educated in Paris. In December 1848, aged seventeen, Marie (secretly called Marie-Studholmine) married Fr√©d√©ric Joseph de Solms (1815‚Äì63), a rich gentleman from Strasbourg who soon left her to go to America. Marie, known as the \\"Princess de Solms\\", remained with her mother, who kept a brilliant salon in Paris frequented by Victor Hugo, Eug√®ne Sue, the younger Alexandre Dumas, and other writers. In the early 1850s Marie had an affair with Count Alexis de Pommereu that produced a son in 1852. In February 1853, French authorities ordered her expulsion from the Empire, after accusations that she had illegally bore the name Bonaparte and had stirred up \\"scandalous disorders\\". There were however reports that Emperor Napoleon III had secretly paid his beautiful young cousin a number of visits, that the jealous Empress Eugenie had learned of the visits and told her husband that Marie maintained a salon of subversives, and that he had thereafter ordered her expulsion. In August 1853 Marie settled at Aix-les-Bains in Savoy, then part of the Kingdom of Sardinia, where her lover (Pommereu) built her a chalet that soon became the center of a new literary salon. She went often to Turin, the kingdom's capital, where she established yet another salon at the H√¥tel Feder. She maintained friendships with Hugo, Sue, Dumas and others, including Lajos Kossuth, Alphonse de Lamartine, F√©licit√© Robert de Lamennais, Henri Rochefort, Tony Revillon, and the United States minister to Sardinia, John Moncure Daniel. In 1859 Napoleon III's profligate cousin, Prince Napoleon, was betrothed to Clotilde, the fifteen-year-old daughter of King Vittorio Emanuele II of Sardinia. This was done as part of an agreement concluded by the king's prime minister, Count Cavour, to guarantee French support for Sardinia in the oncoming war to free northern Italy from Austrian occupation. (The king, openly unhappy with the betrothal, was secretly pleased.) Turin society was scandalized when the Princess de Solms flouted the emperor by appearing at the betrothal ball on the arm of U.S. Minister Daniel. She was an early woman journalist, and through Sainte-Beuve, Marie contributed to Le Constitutionnel under the pen name \\"Baron de Stock\\". She also wrote for the Pays and the Turf. After Savoy was annexed to France (1860) as another part of the agreement between Napoleon III and Cavour, Marie went back to Paris where she played a prominent part in the literary and social events of the time. She gathered in her salon men of all shades of opinion. In 1863, her husband having died, she remarried the Piedmontese statesman Urbano Rattazzi, and lived with him in Italy where she was known as \\"Divina Fanciulla\\". After his death in June 1873, Madame Rattazzi returned to Paris, and a few months later married her Spanish friend, under-secretary Don Luis de Rute y Ginez (1844‚Äì89), whom she also outlived. Marie died a widow in 1902 in Paris. She had one son, Alexis de Solms (1852‚Äì1927), fathered by her lover, Count Alexis de Pommereu; one daughter, Romana Rattazzi (1871‚Äì1943), by her second husband; and two adopted daughters, Teresa de Rute (1883‚Äì89) and Dolores de Rute (1885‚Äì88), with her third husband. She was buried in Aix-les-Bains (France). Writings Her writings consist of miscellaneous sketches, verses, plays, and novels, such as Si j'etais reine (1868) and Les marriages de la cr√©ole (1866), reprinted under the title La chanteuse (1870). Her 1867 novel Bicheville, a thinly disguised attack on the society of Florence, capital of the new Kingdom of Italy, caused serious embarrassment to Rattazzi, who was serving as prime minister of the recently established kingdom. She also wrote L'Aventurier des Colonies (1885), a drama; and the volume of tales Enigme sans Clef (1894). In 1881 she edited Rattazzi et son Temps, and in the last two or three years of her life published two volumes of her own memoirs, and edited the Nouvelle Revue Internationale, to which she also contributed a significant amount.

It is located northeast of Bras√≠lia, 24 km from the state boundary with Bahia, on interstate highway BR-020 (Bras√≠lia-Salvador). History The town of Posse arose with the arrival of Northeastern migrants fleeing the drought in search of fertile lands in the mid-19th century. Among the pioneers there were many descendants of Argentinians and Portuguese and many of the steams and rivers had names remembering those far away lands‚ÄîRio Corrente, Rio Prata, and Porto Buenos Aires. The settlement was first called Buenos Aires, located below the joining of the Rio Corrente with the Rio Paran√£. The town did not progress because it was hit by malaria and the first settlers went to the higher lands at the foot of Serra Geral, where they formed another settlement. Naz√°rio da Silva Ribeiro, the founder had a chapel built in honor of Nossa Senora Santana. The new town received the name \\"Posse\\" (possession) because the inhabitants had seized the land along the Passagem do Gerais stream, in 1830. The town became a district in the municipality of S√£o Domingos. In 1872 it got its autonomy and the name was changed from Nossa Senora Santa de Posse to just \\"Posse\\". In 1970 the BR-70 (Bras√≠lia-Salvador) was built and Posse began to grow.Sepin Hist√≥rico dos Munic√≠pios Geography Posse has a privileged location at the foot of the Serra das Araras, with an average temperature of 25 ¬∞C and a supply of mineral water taken from the slopes of the mountains. The eastern part of the municipality is crossed by the Rio Paran√£ and its tributaries. This corresponds to the so-called gap (v√£o), an area that stretches from the high valley of the river to the plateaus that surround it. Its lands are fertile, with natural pasture and forests rich in hardwoods. The lands have a natural fertilizer‚Äîphosphate‚Äîwhich helps to renew the soil. There are many waterfalls in the region, the most important being those of Rio √Ågua Quente, on Fazenda Quebradas; Rio Prata, on Fazenda Campo Bonito; Rio Piracanjuba, on Fazenda Santo Ant√¥nio; and Rio Buriti, on the ranch of the same name. =Boundaries= Municipal boundaries are with Alvorada do Norte, Buritin√≥polis, Iaciara, Guarani de Goi√°s, Mamba√≠, Simol√¢ndia and the state of Bahia.

Sepin Dist√¢ncias a Goi√¢nia Economy The main economic activity of the town is commerce. The preponderance of commerce is due to the strategic location of being on the border between Goi√°s and Bahia. Besides the inhabitants of the town, the population of the west of Bahia also shops in Posse. The town serves a population of 50,000 people. With the distance to the state capital being so great Posse has always had stronger ties with the state of Bahia and the Federal District. Agriculture stimulates the commerce of the town, with farmers coming from the vast agricultural region of the west of Bahia. Machines, seeds, fertilizers, and other products are acquired in Posse. Although they have farms in Bahia, most of the large farmers, who are mainly from the south of the country, live in Posse. After commerce, cattle raising is the second most important economic activity of the region. There were 109,500 head of cattle in 2006. Other animals raised were poultry and swine. The main agricultural products were rice, bananas, sugarcane, beans, manioc, and corn.

A beachcomber is a person who participates in the activity of beachcombing. Despite these general definitions, beachcombing and beachcomber are words with multiple, but related, meanings that have evolved over time. Historical usage The first appearance of the word \\"beachcombers\\" in print was in Richard Henry Dana Jr.'s Two Years Before the Mast (1840) and later referenced in Herman Melville's Omoo (1847).H.E. Maude, Of Islands and Men (1968), 135. It described a population of Europeans who lived in South Pacific islands, \\"combing\\" the beach and nearby water for flotsam, jetsam, or anything else they could use or trade. When a beachcomber became totally dependent upon coastal fishing for his sustenance, or abandoned his original culture and set of values (\\"went native\\"), then the term \\"beachcomber\\" was synonymous with a criminal, a drifter, or a bum. While the vast majority of beachcombers were simply unemployed sailors, many may have chosen to live in Pacific island communities; as described by Herman Melville in Typee, or Harry Franck in the book Vagabonding Around the World. After enduring a voyage of danger and hardship, it was not uncommon for a few sailors to desert a whaling ship when it arrived in Tahiti or the Marquesas and reside, at least for a while, in the South Sea islands of Polynesia. If another beachcomber was ready to take his place in order to get home, the captain might let the disgruntled crewman go; otherwise, the captain would offer the natives a reward to find and return the deserter, and deduct the reward, plus interest, from the deserter's pay. In other words, the deserter, if caught, would end up working the entire voyage for no pay at all, or even return home in debt to his employers.ABC Whipple, Yankee Whalers in the South Seas, Doubleday, New York, p 150 In Typee, Melville deserted, not once but twice, before signing on as a crewman on a Navy frigate, without fear of repercussions. Some beachcombers traded between local tribes, and between tribes and visiting ships. Some lived on the rewards for deserters, or found replacement crewmen either through persuasion or through shanghaiing. Many, such as David Whippy, also served as mediators between hostile native tribes as well as between natives and visiting ships.Ruth Blair (1996), Typee, (Oxford World's Classics). Introduction xv. Whippy deserted his ship in 1820 and lived among the cannibal Fijis for the rest of his life.David Whippy's long journey home (retrieved 19 June 2015) The Fijis would sometimes capture the crew of a stranded ship for ransom, and eat them if they resisted. Whippy would try to rescue them but sometimes found only roasted bones. Ultimately he became American Consul to Fiji, and left many descendants among the islands.ABC Whipple, Yankee Whalers in the South Pacific, Doubleday, New York, p 151 There had always been a small number of castaways in the South Pacific since the earliest Spanish explorers, but the numbers increased dramatically in the early 19th century with the beginning of the whaling era circa 1819. It is estimated that 75% of beachcombers were sailors, particularly whalemen, who had jumped ship. They were predominantly British but with an increasing number of Americans, particularly in Hawaii and the Carolines. Perhaps 20% were English convicts who had been transported to Australia and escaped from the penal colonies there.H. E. Maude, Beachcombers and castaways, The Journal of the Polynesian Society 73: 3 (1964) 254‚Äì293 It is estimated that in 1850 there were over 2,000 beachcombers throughout Polynesia and Micronesia.K.R.Howe, Where the Waves Fall: A New South Sea Islands History from First Settlement to Colonial Ruler (1984), 103. The Polynesia and Melanesia communities were usually receptive to beachcombers and castaways who were absorbed into the local community, usually by formal adoption or by marriage, with the beachcombers and castaways often being considered a status symbol of the local chief. Beachcombers who returned to Europe conveyed tattoo styles of the Pacific islands. The social and commercial role of beachcombers ended when missionaries arrived, and with the growth of a commercial community with European (palagi) traders, resident on each island, who were the representatives of trading companies. Many beachcombers made the transition to becoming island traders. Other languages In Uruguay, the term has been naturalized into the Spanish form Bichicome, and refers to poor or lower-class people. The Spanish form also draws on the similarities to the Spanish bicho (small animal/insect) and comer (eat), Similarly, the term has entered the Greek slang through sailors, the word \\"pitsik√≥mis\\" (œÄŒπœÑœÉŒπŒ∫œåŒºŒ∑œÇ). That's also the case of the Galician term bichicoma. The Russian word –±–∏—á (and a rarer form –±–∏—á–∫–æ–º–±–µ—Ä, –±–∏—á–∫–æ–º–µ—Ä) appeared not later than 1930s, in the sense of temporarily unemployed sailor, hanging about in the port and living from hand to mouth; nowadays it means a vagabond or a hobo. Archaeology In archaeology the beachcombing lifestyle is associated with coastal shell- middens that sometimes accumulate over many hundreds if not thousands of years. Evidence at Klasies River Caves in South Africa, and Gulf of Zula in Eritrea, show that a beachcombing option is one of the earliest activities separating anatomically modern human Homo sapiens from the ancestral subspecies of Homo erectus. Modern usage Many modern beachcombers follow the \\"drift lines\\" or \\"tide lines\\" on the beach and are interested in the (mostly natural) objects that the sea casts up. For these people, \\"beachcombing\\" is the recreational activity of looking for and finding various curiosities that have washed in with the tide: seashells of every kind, fossils, pottery shards, historical artifacts, sea beans (drift seeds), sea glass (beach glass), driftwood, and messages in bottles. Items such as lumber, plastics, and all manner of things that have been lost or discarded by seagoing vessels will be collected by some beachcombers, as long as the items are either decorative or useful in some way to the collector. (However, this usually does not include the great bulk of marine debris, most of which is neither useful nor decorative.) Edmund James Banfield is an example of the modern beachcomber in his residence on Dunk Island in the early twentieth century where he studied and wrote about the vegetation, bird and sea life of the island. Sophisticated recreational beachcombers use knowledge of how storms, geography, ocean currents, and seasonal events determine the arrival and exposure of rare finds.Richard LaMotte, Pure Sea Glass, Sea Glass Publishing (2004), 20Chuck and Debbie Robinson, The Art of Shelling Old Squan Village Publishing (1995) 22‚Äì23 They also practice eco-conservation and do not kill mollusks for their shells, dig holes in the sand, or gouge cliff faces for fossils or reefs for coral specimens.S. Deacon Ritterbush, A Beachcomber's Odyssey, Vol. I: Treasures from a Collected Past, Ritz Dotter Publishers (2008), 115 Many beachcombers serve as excellent stewards of the seashore, working with government agencies to monitor shore erosion, dumping and pollution, and reef and cliff damage, etc. Recognized beachcomb experts today include oceanographer Curtis Ebbesmeyer (Flotsametrics and the Floating World); eco-educator Dr. Deacon Ritterbush (A Beachcomber‚Äôs Odyssey); sea glass experts Richard LaMotte (Pure Sea Glass) and C.S. Lambert (Sea Glass Chronicles); geologist Margaret Carruthers (Beach Stones); shell specialists Chuck and Debbie Robinson (The Art of Shelling), and zoologist Dr. Blair Witherington and Dawn Witherington, (Florida's Living Beaches: A Guide for the Curious Beachcomber). = In popular culture= Both the recreational and utilitarian aspects of beachcombing or ‚Äúwrecking‚Äù were celebrated in the film The Wrecking Season, an award-winning film that portrays playwright Nick Darke‚Äôs passion for beachcombing on the coast of Cornwall, UK. A popular Canadian family television drama, The Beachcombers, focused on the work of beachcombers in late-twentieth-century British Columbia. In the James Bond film On Her Majesty's Secret Service, Bond gets two weeks leave, and when Moneypenny asks him where he is off to, he replies: \\"just some place to laze about. Beachcombing\\".

It was the most produced type of the so-called Kriegslokomotiven or Kriegsloks (war locomotives). The Class 52 was a wartime development of the pre-war DRG Class 50, using fewer parts and less expensive materials to speed production. They were designed by Richard Wagner who was Chief Engineer of the Central Design Office at the Locomotive Standards Bureau of the DRG. About a dozen classes of locomotive were referred to as Kriegslokomotiven; however, the three main classes were the Class 52, 50 and 42. They were numbered 52 1-52 7794 Many locomotives passed into Russian ownership after the Second World War. In the U.S.S.R. the class were designated TE (T–≠). Other operators of the type included Poland and Romania, Bulgaria, Norway and Turkey. In Yugoslavia locomotives of the type were classified J≈Ω 33.  Overview  Over 7794 locomotives of DRB Class 52 type were built across Europe for use on the Eastern Front during the Second World War. Thus it was one of the most numerous steam locomotives in the world. To achieve such numbers, the German locomotive manufacturers were merged into the Gemeinschaft Grossdeutscher Lokomotivhersteller (GGL), which was a subdivision of the Hauptausschuss Schienenfahrzeuge (HAS) founded in 1942. Key HAS figures were the Reichsminister for munition and armament, Albert Speer and the Reich transport minister, Julius Dorpm√ºller. The GGL included the following locomotive manufacturers (including an approximate number of Class 52s produced): # LOFAG, Vienna: 1,053 units # Henschel, Kassel (Henschel Flugzeugwerke AG): 1,050 units (forced labor) # Schwartzkopff, Berlin: 647 units # Krauss-Maffei, Munich: 613 units # Borsig, Berlin; branches: Borsig-Rheinmetall AG D√ºsseldorf (in Siemianowice, Poland), Borsig Lokomotivwerke Hennigsdorf, Borsig Werke Breslau-Hundsfeld (now Wroc≈Çaw-Psie Pole, Poland): 542 units (forced labor, incl. KL Auschwitz) # Schichau-Werke Elbing (now ElblƒÖg, Poland): 505 units (forced labor, incl. KZ Stutthof, and its subcamps). # Maschinenbau und Bahnbedarfs AG (MBA) formerly Orenstein & Koppel, Babelsberg: 400 units # DWM Posen, Pozna≈Ñ (occupied Poland), German takeover of Polish manufacturer H. Cegielski ‚Äì Pozna≈Ñ: 314 units (forced labor) # Oberschlesische Lokfabrik Krenau, Chrzan√≥w (occupied Poland), German takeover of Polish manufacturer Fablok: 264 units (forced labor) # Maschinenfabrik Esslingen: 250 units # Jung, Jungenthal, Kirchen: 231 units # ≈†koda Works, Pilsen: 153 units # Grafenstaden, Strasbourg: 139 units Engine design The class 52 was a simplified version of the prewar Reichsbahn class 50 locomotive (produced 1938-1942). The simplified design of the class 52 was intended to reduce the man-hours and skills needed to manufacture it and to adapt to wartime shortages of strategic materials. Additional design changes gave the locomotives and their crew better protection against the cold. Between 1942 and the end of the war in May 1945 over 6,300 class 52 locomotives were built. Additional locomotives were built post-war, giving a class total of probably 6719 units, delivered by seventeen manufacturers. The Class 42 was a larger version of the Class 52, but was produced in small numbers. In the early postwar years class 52s were used by many European countries, the largest user being the Soviet Union, which had more than 2,100 of them, designated class TE (, from Trophy, equivalent to E-class). Poland had more than a thousand and East Germany had about 800. The type was also widespread among other eastern European nations. Western European countries replaced them with more modern locomotives as soon as possible, with the exception of Austria where they were used until 1976. The simplicity and effectiveness, plus the large production total, meant that many eastern European countries were slow to withdraw these Kriegslokomotiven. Poland used them into the early 1990s; Turkey and Bosnia were also late users of the type. Wagner had wanted locomotives which were long-lasting and easy to maintain, and unlike British engineers did not consider a high power-to-weight ratio a priority. The resulting Kriegslokomotive had a low axleload of and could haul 40 percent more freight than the old Prussian locomotives they replaced. The class 52 could haul at without significant strain.  Countries using the engine  Following the invasion of Poland in September 1939 Nazi Germany disbanded the Polish State Railways (PKP). Polish rail officials were either executed in mass shootings or imprisoned, and some 8,000 managerial positions were staffed with German officials. Former Polish companies began producing German engines BR44, BR50 and BR86 as early as 1940, some using forced labor. By 1944, the factories in Pozna≈Ñ and Chrzan√≥w were producing the redesigned Kriegslok BR52 locomotives for the Eastern Front. These locomotives were made almost entirely of steel; the use of more expensive, non-ferrous metals was dropped in view of the engines' expected lifespan. After the war, some 1,200 class 52s remained in reconstituted Poland. Another 200 were acquired from the Soviet Union in 1962-64. The class 52, designated Ty2, began to be phased out in the 1980s; its last regular use was in 1999. Some 100 were built for Romanian State Railways, becoming class 150.1000 engines. Over 150 were in use by the Bulgarian State Railways as class 15. Turkish Republic Railways built 10 for forming the TCDD 56501 Class. Turkish Railways acquired 43 additional loc's at the end of the war, these had previously been on hire. The Deutsche Reichsbahn (DR) in East Germany had 200 machines reconstructed to the new DR Class 52.80. 74 locomotives were sent to occupied Norway during World War II and were confiscated following the war. The Norwegian classification was class 63, and was nicknamed Stortysker (\\"big German\\"). One engine, restored by the Norwegian Railway Club, is preserved at the Norwegian Railway Museum in Hamar. The ƒåSD Czechoslovak state railways used hundreds of 52s post-war, some left behind by the Germans after 1945, some being rebuilt by the ≈†koda Works in Plze≈à. They bore designation class ƒåSD 555; several dozen were subsequently adapted, as the 555.3, to burn mazut fuel oil, a large surplus of which was generated in synthetic fuel plants in occupied Czechoslovakia from brown coal. The 555.3 differed visibly by having a lid on the smokestack to slow down cooling of the lining of the flue passage, to prevent cracking. The Hungarian State Railways (M√ÅV) acquired 100 type 52s from the Soviet Union in 1963. They were designated class 520 and used into the 1980s. Others were used by Yugoslavia before that country's dissolution in the 1990s. A few were still in industrial service in Bosnia in late 2017. http://www.internationalsteam.co.uk/trains/bosnia40.htm  Gallery  Several Class 52s have been preserved in operating condition. One is at the Nene Valley Railway in Peterborough, England. Another one is in service with the Franconian Museum Railway in Bavaria, Germany.

All of the other estimated 781 Jewish refugees and 10 crew were killed. Early life Stoliar was born the son of Jacob Stoliar in Chi»ôinƒÉu, Bessarabia, which at the time was part of Romania. The Stoliars lived in Chi»ôinƒÉu until 1927, when David and his parents moved to France to join one of Jacob's brothers, a hotelier in Vence in Provence. In 1932 the Stoliars returned to Romania, where Jacob took a job with another of David's uncles, who ran a textile factory. In 1932 David's parents divorced and his mother returned to France, settling with her brother in Paris. She took David with her to Paris but Jacob remained in Bucharest. David was at school at a boarding coll√®ge in Fontainebleau until 1936, when Jacob had him return to Bucharest. David's mother remained in France, where she remarried. David went to school at a Liceu in Bucharest, spending his summer holidays with his mother in Paris. In 1940 the Liceu expelled David for being Jewish, after which he briefly attended a Liceu set up by Bucharest Jewish community. By the end of 1940 the Romanian authorities deported David to a forced labour camp at Poligon near Bucharest. Struma voyage and disaster In 1941 Jacob bought David a ticket to travel on the Struma, an elderly motor schooner that was bound for Palestine. Jacob got him released from the labour camp and bribed Romanian officials to issue Stoliar a passport. On 12 December 1941 David sailed from Constan»õa aboard the Struma, but her engine repeatedly failed and three days later a Turkish tug towed her into Istanbul. At the UK's behest, Turkey held Struma at anchor in Istanbul without allowing her passengers to disembark. Negotiations between Turkey and Britain over the fate of the refugees seemed to reach an impasse, and on 23 February 1942 Turkish authorities boarded Struma, towed her back into the Black Sea with her engine still inoperable and cast her adrift.Stoliar described the harsh behavior of the Turkish police on Strumas arrival. See Druks, 2000, pages 74‚Äì76 & note 26 on page 116. The note quotes from Herman P Eberhalter to President Harry S. Truman, 23 May 1946, President's Official File 204. The next morning, Soviet submarine Shch-213 commanded by D.M. Denezhko sank Struma with a single torpedo. Stoliar survived the blast and clung to a floating piece of deck, and later was joined by the ship's First Officer, who was Bulgarian. Stoliar later claimed the officer told him that he saw the torpedo before it sank the Struma. The officer died overnight. After his rescue Stoliar was detained in Turkey for six weeks. After an outcry and strike in Palestine, Turkish authorities released him to Simon Brod. Afterwards British authorities acquiesced and issued him travel papers and a visa to Palestine; Brod put him on the train to Palestine. British authorities in Palestine interviewed Stoliar about the Struma sinking. He later joined the British Army, in which he served in the 8th Army in North Africa. After the war Stoliar's father Jacob survived the Second World War. They learned that in 1942 the authorities in German-occupied France had deported David's mother, along with her stepson by her second marriage, to their deaths in the Auschwitz -Birkenanu death and slave labour concentration-death camp complex. David married his first wife Adria in 1945, by whom he had a son, and served in the Israeli army in the 1948 Arab‚ÄìIsraeli War. After the war Stoliar worked in the oil industry and in shoe manufacturing. Adria died in 1961 and he married his second wife Marda in 1968. David lived and worked in Japan and then moved to the United States. He and Marda settled in Bend, Oregon. He died on 1 May 2014 at the age of 91.Ofer Aderet, Lone survivor of 'Struma' disaster dies in U.S., Haaretz (4.5.14) ; A Life Well Lived: Only SS Struma Survivor Passes Away (4.5.14) References  Further reading  McFadden, Robert (2016). \\"David Stoliar, Survivor of World War II Disaster, Dies at 91\\", New York Times, 23 January 2016 (delayed obituary).

In 1915 Turkish troops \\"with Kurdish detachments\\" committed mass slaughters of Assyrians in Iran. In the Assyrian village of Haftvan almost 1000 people were beheaded and 5000 Assyrian women were taken to Kurdish harems.The Armenian Genocide: Cultural and Ethical Legacies Richard G.

For the second time, in 1846, the Assyrians residing at the Thuma region have been massacred....\\" British writer William Eagleton said that \\"in 1843 and 1846, Bedirhan started a massacre and booting campaign against the Christian Assyrians (Nestorians) he was anxious about whose getting stronger and independent through becoming able to rule themselves. It was intolerable for Bedirhan to see the Assyrians living on his own territories getting stronger. Thus he killed ten thousand Assyrians. Even though Bedirhan was a feudal tribal leader, he was expressing the aspirations of Kurdish nationalism.\\" Kurdish and Arab attacks on Assyrians continued, culminating in the August 1933 Simele Massacres. About 3000 Assyrians were killed in that single month alone.http://www.atour.com/education/20000825a.html Beginning in August 1933 Iraqi soldiers and Kurdish militia killed thousands of Assyrias in Simele (Iraq). The massacre had a big influence on Raphael Lemkin, the jurist who coined the word \\"genocide. The Simmele Massacre is also commemorated yearly with the official Assyrian Martyrs Day on 7 August. The massacre was carried out by the Iraqi Army, led by Kurdish General Bakir Sidqi, and Kurdish and Arab irregulars. There were about 3,000 victims of the massacre.http://www.aina.org/releases/20040805022140.htm Turks, with the cooperation of Kurdish groups, conducted systematic murder against the Christian population. Beginning in the first half of the 19th century, the Turks allied with Kurdish tribes. After the Kurds weregranted an emirate in Syriac Cizre in 1842, the Kurds launched brutal assaults against Christians under the command of Kurdish emir Bedr Khan, who murdered thousands of Assyrians in the region of Tur Abdin and Hakkari. Christian areas were subjected to the migration of Kurdish tribes. Many massacres were carried out against Christians in 1895 in Diyarbakir, Urfa, Mardin, Nusaybin, Meyafarkin, Tur Abdin and Viranshahr. Assyrians were eradicated from Tur Abdin, Mardin, Diyarbakir and Hakkari in Turkey and Urmia in Iran. The Syriac city of Mardin was captured by Turks and given over to Kurds who expelled its original population.http://araborthodoxy.blogspot.com/2013/12/as-safir-on-history-of- persecution-of.html Only a few of the Christians of the Nineveh Plain remain after the repeated attacks by Arab and Kurdish fighters. Historically Christian cities like Erbil, Zakho, Dohuk, Kirkuk, and Mosul have been Kurdicized and Islamized. Suryanis emigrated from Syria after the Amuda massacre of August 1937. The massacre was carried out by Kurdish general Saeed Agha and emptied the city of its Suryani population. Malikiya, Darbasiya and Amuda have since become completely Kurdish. Also the historically Christian city of Nusaybin has become Kurdish. Christians fled to Qamishly which became a Christian city until the immigration of Kurds beginning in 1926. Kurdish- Christian Armenian relations were bitter at the turn of the 19th century and land conflicts were a major problem. Many Christians and Europeans regarded the Kurds as barbarians and a major threat, the French consul at Erzurum describing them as a blood-thirsty savage population which is used to plundering and a nomadic life. Kurds also played a major part in the Ottoman army, also through the Hamidiye.The Margins of Empire: Kurdish Militias in the Ottoman Tribal Zone, Janet Klein Stanford University Press, 2011 The Kurdish chieftain Bedr Khan during his rise to power massacred about 10,000 Assyrians in 1842. Nestorian tribes were massacred by Kurds in 1843. In 1915 Kurds massacred more than 27,000 Assyrians in Urmia region alone and destroyed more than 100 villages Assyrian villages in March 1915 alone.Reforging a Forgotten History: Iraq and the Assyrians in the Twentieth Century, Sargon Donabed Edinburgh University Press, 2015 In 1916 Kurds and Turks massacred Assyrians in Bohtan region. Both Kurdish and Turkish nationalists deny the fact that Assyrians were the original inhabitants of south-eastern Turkey and northern Iraq.Forgotten Genocides: Oblivion, Denial, and Memory herausgegeben, Rene Lemarchand. University of Pennsylvania Press, 2011 Chapter 7. The Assyrian population was so small in the aftermath of the genocide that the region called Assyria in ancient times came to be known as \\"Kurdistan\\". The Kurds and Turks cynically resisted Assyrian and Armenian efforts to attain statehood after World War II. While the Kurdish population doubled from two million in 1970 to four million in 2002, the Christian population decreased. =Modern history= From 1914, Assyrians suffered genocide at the hands of the Ottoman Empire and certain Kurdish tribes in what is known as the Assyrian genocide. This led to an exodus of Assyrians from the mountains of Hakkari and the plains of Urmia to a British-led refugee camp in Baqubah. British Mandate Independent Kingdom of Iraq =Simele Massacre= During July 1933, about 800 armed Assyrians headed for the Syrian border, where they were turned back by the French. While King Faisal had briefly left the country for medical reasons, the Minister of Interior, Hikmat Sulayman, adopted a policy aimed at a final solution of the \\"Assyrian problem\\". This policy was implemented by an Iraqi-Kurd, General Bakr Sidqi. After engaging in several unsuccessful clashes with armed Assyrian tribesmen, on 11 August 1933, Sidqi permitted his men to attack and kill about 3,000 unarmed Assyrian civilian villagers, including women, children and the elderly, at the Assyrian villages of Sumail (Simele) district, and later at Suryia. Having scapegoated the Assyrians as dangerous national traitors, this massacre of unarmed civilians became a symbol of national pride, and enhanced Sidqi's prestige. The British, though represented by a powerful military presence as provided by the Anglo-Iraqi Treaty of 1930, failed to intervene or allow the well-disciplined Assyrian Levies under their command to do so, and indeed helped whitewash the event at the League of Nations. The Assyrian repression marked the entrance of the military into Iraqi politics, a pattern that has periodically re-emerged since 1958, and offered an excuse for enlarging conscription. Republic of Iraq =Recognition of the Syriac language by the Ba'thist regime= In the early 1970s, the secularist Ba'ath regime initially tried to change the suppression of Assyrians in Iraq through different laws that were passed. On 20 February 1972, the government passed the law to recognize the cultural rights of Assyrians by allowing Aramaic be taught schools in which the majority of pupils spoke that language in addition to Arabic. Aramaic was also to be taught at intermediate and secondary schools in which the majority of students spoke that language in addition to Arabic, but it never happened. Special Assyrian programs were to be broadcast on public radio and television and three Syriac-language magazines were planned to be published in the capital. An Association of Syriac-Speaking Authors and Writers had also been established. The bill turned out to be a failure. The radio stations created as the result of this decree were closed after a few months. While the two magazines were allowed to be published, only 10 percent of their material was in Aramaic. No school was allowed to teach in Aramaic either. =Pre-invasion Iraq= Reports from various sources \\"indicate a better human rights situation overall in the Kurdish-controlled areas of Northern Iraq than exists elsewhere in the country\\" (AI 2000, 135; U.K. Immigration & Nationality Directorate Sept. 1999; USDOS 25 Feb. 2000) Also, according to the reports, \\"while freedom of speech, religion, movement, and press are strongly restricted throughout Iraq, these freedoms do exist to a certain extent in parts of the Kurd- controlled area \\"(USDOS 25 Feb. 2000). However, reports regarding isolated human rights abuses continued in 1999. The US State government reported that in 1999 Assyrian Christian Helena Aloun Sawa was murdered, and according to AINA, \\"the murder resembles a well-established pattern of complicity by Kurdish authorities in attacks against Assyrian Christians in the north\\". The murder was investigated by a commission appointed by the KDP but no results of the investigation were reported by year's end. There were also incidents of mob violence by Muslims against Christians in northern Iraq. Christian Assyrians were also targeted in a series of bombings in Erbil in 1998 to 1999, and Assyrian groups have criticized the KRG for the lack of investigation. According to the AINA, the KDP blockaded Assyrian villages in 1999 and \\"later entered the villages and beat villagers\\". However, after invervention by the International Committee of the Red Cross the KDP left the villages again. According to the UK Immigration & Nationality Directorate \\"despite Tariq Aziz's lofty position in the Baghdad regime, Christians have little political influence in the Ba'ath government\\" (Sept. 1999) Education in any language other than Arabic and Kurdish was prohibited by the government in Baghdad. Therefore, Assyrians were not permitted to attend classes in Syriac. In the Kurdish-controlled northern areas, classes in Syriac have been permitted since 1991. However, according to some Assyrian sources \\"regional Kurdish authorities refused to allow the classes to begin.\\" However, details of this practice were not available, and Kurdish authorities denied the accusations. In 1999, the Kurdistan Observer claimed that \\"the Central Government had warned the administration in the Kurdish region against allowing Turkoman, Assyrian, or Yazidi minority schools.\\" According to the UK Immigration & Nationality Directorate, \\"the Central Government has engaged various abuses against the Assyrian Christians, and has often suspected them of 'collaborating' with Kurds\\" (Sept. 1999). According to a report by The World Directory of Minorities \\"Assyrians were unable to avoid the Kurdish conflict. As with the Kurds, some supported the government, others allied themselves with the Kurdish nationalist movement\\" (Minority Rights Group International 1997, 346). =Post-invasion Iraq= Iraqi Christians have been victims of executions, forced displacement campaigns, torture, violence and the target of Islamist groups like al-Qaeda and ISIS. Since the 2003 Iraq War, Iraqi Christians have fled from the country and their population has collapsed under the Government of Iraq. The Majority of Christians have either fled to the Iraqi Kurdistan or abroad. In 2003, Iraqi Christians were the primary target of extremist Sunni Islamists. Many kidnapped Christians were forced to leave Christianity or be tortured. On 1 August 2004 a series of car bomb attacks took place during the Sunday evening Mass in churches in Baghdad and Mosul, killing and wounding a large number of Christians. The Jordanian jihadist and 1st emir of Al-Qaeda in Iraq Abu Musab al-Zarqawi was blamed for the attacks. In 2006, an Orthodox priest, Boulos Iskander, was snatched off the streets of Mosul by a Sunni Arab group that demanded a ransom. His body was later found, with his arms and legs having been cut off. In 2007, there were reports of a push to drive Christians out of the historically Christian suburb of Dora in southern Baghdad, with some Sunni extremists accusing the Christians of being allies of the Americans. A total number of 239 similar cases were registered by police between 2007 and 2009. In 2008, a priest called Ragheed Ganni, was shot dead in his church along with three of his companions. In the same year, there were reports that Christian students were being harassed. In 2008, the charity Barnabas conducted research into 250 Iraqi Christian IDPs who had fled to the north of the country (Iraqi Kurdistan) to seek refugee status and found nearly half had witnessed attacks on churches or Christians, or been personally targeted by violence. In 2009, the Kurdistan Regional Government reported that more than 40,000 Christians had moved from Baghdad, Basra and Mosul to the Iraqi Kurdistan cities. The reports also stated that the number of Christian families moving to Iraqi Kurdistan is growing and they were providing support and financial assistance for 11,000 of those families, and some are employed by the KRG. In 2010, Sunni Islamist groups attacked a Syrian Catholic church in Baghdad during Sunday evening Mass on 31 October, killing more than 60 and wounding 78 Iraqi Christians. In 2011, Islamist extremists assassinated Christians randomly using sniper rifles. Two months before the incident, two Christians had been shot for unknown reasons in Baghdad and two other Christians had been shot by Jihadis in Mosul. Human rights organizations have recorded 66 assault cases on churches and monasteries until 2012, as well as about 200 kidnappings. On 30 May 2011, a Christian man was beheaded by a Salafi extremist in Mosul. On 2 August 2011 a Catholic church was bombed by Sunni extremists in the Turkmen area of Kirkuk, wounding more than 23 Christians. On 15 August 2011 a church was bombed by al-Qaeda in the center of Kirkuk. In 2014, during the 2014 Northern Iraq offensive, the Islamic State of Iraq (ISIS) ordered all Christians in the area of its control, where the Iraqi Army had collapsed, to pay a special tax of approximately $470 per family, convert to Islam, or be killed. Many of them took refuge in nearby Kurdish- controlled regions of Iraq. After Saddam Hussein's fall in 2003, the Assyrian Democratic Movement was one of the smaller political parties that emerged in the social chaos of the occupation. Its officials say that while armed members of the Assyrian Democratic Movement also took part in the liberation of the key oil cities of Kirkuk and Mosul in the north, the Assyrians were not invited to join the steering committee that was charged with defining Iraq's future. The ethnic make-up of the Iraq Interim Governing Council briefly (September 2003 ‚Äì June 2004) guiding Iraq after the invasion included a single Assyrian Christian, Younadem Kana, a leader of the Assyrian Democratic Movement and an opponent of Saddam Hussein since 1979. Assyrians in post- Saddam Iraq have faced a high rate of persecution by fundamentalist Islamists since the beginning of the Iraq War. By early August 2004 this persecution included church bombings, and fundamentalist groups' enforcement of Muslim codes of behavior upon Christians, e.g., banning alcohol, forcing women to wear hijab. The violence against the community has led to the exodus of perhaps as much as half of the community. While Assyrians made up only just over 5% of the total Iraqi population before the war, according to the United Nations, Assyrians are over-represented among the Iraqi refugees (as much as 13%) who are stranded in Syria, Jordan, Lebanon, and Turkey. A large number of Assyrians have found refuge in ancient Assyrian Christian villages in Nineveh plains and Kurdistan Region. This led some Assyrians and Iraqi and foreign politicians to call for an Assyrian Christian autonomous region in those areas. In 2008 the Assyrians formed their own militia, the Qaraqosh Protection Committee to protect Assyrian towns, villages and regions in the north. In 2008 the Assyrian Archbishop Paulos Faraj Rahho of the Chaldean Catholic Church in Mosul was assassinated by some Kurds while some have claimed assassins were hired by local Arab tribes. Rahho was a defender of Assyrian self-administration. Some observers have claimed that Kurdish KDP forces often used to practice their shooting on important Assyrian cultural heritage sites.HUMAN RIGHTS REPORT ON ASSYRIANS IN IRAQ 2013, by Assyria Council of Europe and the Assyria Foundation Kurdish KDP security forces have been criticized for human rights abuses, abuses \\"ranged from threats and intimidation to detention in undisclosed locations without due process.\\" In 2015, the local KDP security forces arrested and detained political activist Kamal Said Kadir, for having written articles on the Internet critical of the KDP. He was sentenced to 30 years in prison. Some activists have claimed that membership in Kurdish parties is necessary to obtain \\"employment and educational opportunities\\" in Iraqi Kurdistan. The US State department report said that \\"Kurdish authorities abused and discriminated against minorities in the North, including Turcomen, Arabs, Christians, and Shabak\\", and that Kurdish authorities \\"denied services to some villages, arrested minorities without due process and took them to undisclosed locations for detention, and pressured minority schools to teach in the Kurdish language\\". Christian minorities in Kirkuk also \\"charged that Kurdish security forces targeted Arabs and Turcomen\\".Iraq report, Bureau of Democracy, Human Rights, and Labor 2005. March 8, 2006. \\"The Kurdish parties also control \\"the pursuit of formal education and the granting of academic positions\\". In 2015 Kurdish security forces in Bartalah reportedly broke up a peaceful demonstration by Shabak people, thereby assaulting several demonstrators. The US State department reported on allegations that the KRG discriminated against Christian minorities. Christians living in areas north of Mosul said that the KRG seized their property without compensation and that the KRG began building Kurdish settlements on their land. Assyrian Christians also said that the \\"KDP- dominated judiciary routinely discriminated against non-Muslims and legal judgments in their favor were not enforced\\". The Kurdish political parties \\"encouraged and supported resettlement of Kurds in Kirkuk outside the framework of the IPCC\\". However Arabs remained \\"in antagonistic and extremely poor conditions, facing pressure from Kurdish authorities to leave the province\\". In 2015 elections, many of the mostly Christian residents in the Nineveh Plain were unable to vote, \\"polling places did not open, ballot boxes were not delivered, and incidents of voter fraud and intimidation occurred\\". Kurdish militia refused to \\"allow ballot boxes to pass to predominantly Christian villages\\". The KRG also reportedly \\"pressured NGOs into hiring only Kurds and dismissing non-Kurds on security grounds\\".\\" Assyrians have criticized the kurdification of the school curricula, and have complained about the confiscation and occupation of Assyrian lands, and \\"that the Kurds invent new and impossible laws when the legitimate owners ask for their lands\\".http://www.aina.org/releases/20111010102607.htm Assyrians have criticized that while Kurds are very well funded, the Assyrian Christians receive almost no funding for their schools. Assyrians have also said that Kurds have modified and falsified school textbooks (kurdification) and changed traditional Christian names to Kurdish names. In textbooks it was even claimed that some biblical figures were Kurdish.https://www.welt.de/politik/ausland/article155513600/Ein-Krieg-um- Schulbuecher-bestimmt-Syriens-Zukunft.html It was reported that the man accused of killing the Christian politician Francis Yousif Shabo in 1993 is \\"allowed to walk around freely\\" in Kurdistan. The impunity for those who attacked or killed Assyrians in the Kurdistan region was criticized.http://ekurd.net/mismas/articles/misc2010/6/state3940.htm Assyrian Christian David Jindo was one of many murdered Christian politicians. Other prominent Assyrian leaders who were killed by Kurdish nationalists include Patriarch Mar Shimun, Franso Hariri, Margaret George (one of the first female Peshmerga) and Francis Shabo. Many of these figures were killed \\"in spite of their attempts to engage with, or work under, Kurds\\".http://www.joshualandis.com/blog/the-assyrians-of-syria-history-and- prospets-by-mardean-isaac/http://www.syriacsnews.com/press-release-general- public-syriac-assyrian-chaldean-people/ In April 2015 David Jendo was killed, he was leader of the Assyrian Khabour guards.

A report \\"‚ÄòWe had nowhere else to go‚Äô: Forced displacement and demolitions in northern Syria\\" by Amnesty International documented many cases of forced displacement and home demolitions amounting to war crimes carried out by the Autonomous Administration led by the Syrian Kurdish PYD party. The report also documented cases of \\"deliberate displacement of thousands of civilians and the razing of entire villages in areas under the control of the PYD.https://www.amnesty.org/en/press-releases/2015/10/syria-us-allys-razing- of-villages-amounts-to-war-crimes/ The Aramean politician Johny Messo stated that the last attack by the YPG \\"on an Aramean Christian self-defense unit in Qamishli had killed one Aramean. Messo also criticized that Syria‚Äôs minorities \\"were not allowed to participate as an independent voice in the Geneva peace talks\\". He said that \\"there are thousands of Aramean Christians living in northern Syria, and the PYD is trying to intimidate and threaten them\\".http://aa.com.tr/en/politics/syrias-christians-pressured-by-forced-pyd- assimilation/541614 Assyrians lack many democratic rights compared to Kurds, with all important decisions being taken by Kurdish politicians of the PYD. The US State government also reported that in Kurdish controlled areas Assyrian schools and classes Syriac were not permitted or prevented in some cases.http://www.state.gov/j/drl/rls/hrrpt/2000/nea/787.htm There were also incidents of mob violence by Kurdistan Workers party (KWP) against Christians in northern Iraq. Christian Assyrians were also targeted in a series of bombings in Erbil in 1998 to 1999, and Assyrian groups have criticized the KRG for the lack of investigation. According to the US Department of State the KDP blockaded Assyrian villages in 1999 and \\"later entered the villages and beat villagers\\". However, after invervention by the International Committee of the Red Cross the KDP left the villages again. An example of Kurdification is the attack on the Assyrian town Rabatki in 2013 by General Aref al-Zebari and his brother Habib al-Hares Zabari, reportedly by Kurdish peshmerga soldiers. It has been reported that many Assyrian girls are forced into prostitution by Kurdish criminal organizations, and the families of these girls have also been threatened. Jyllands-Posten Muhammad cartoons The publication of satirical cartoons of the Islamic prophet Muhammad in the Danish newspaper Jyllands-Posten on 30 September 2005 led to an increase in violence against the Assyrian community. At first, the cartoons did not get much attention, but when the Egyptian media picked up on the publication in late December 2005, violence and protests erupted around the world. On 29 January, six churches in the Iraqi cities of Baghdad and Kirkuk were targeted by car bombs, killing 13-year-old worshipper Fadi Raad Elias. No militants claimed to be retaliating for the pictures, nor was this the first time Iraqi churches have been bombed; but the bishop of the church stated \\"The church blasts were a reaction to the cartoons published in European papers. But Christians are not responsible for what is published in Europe.\\" Many Assyrians in Iraq now feel like \\"Westerners should not give wild statements [as] everyone can attack us [in response]\\" and \\"Today I'm afraid to walk the streets, because I'm Christian.\\" Also on 29 January, a Muslim Cleric in the Iraqi city of Mosul issued a fatwa stating, \\"Expel the (Assyrian) Crusaders and infidels from the streets, schools, and institutions because they have offended the person of the prophet.\\" It has been reported that Muslim students beat up a Christian student at Mosul University in response to the fatwa on the same day. On 6 February, leaflets were distributed in Ramadi, Iraq, by the militant group \\"The Military Wing for the Army of Justice\\" demanding that Christians \\"halt their religious rituals in churches and other worship places because they insulted Islam and Muslims.\\"Sotaliraq.com - ÿµŸàÿ™ ÿßŸÑÿπÿ±ÿßŸÇ Pope Benedict XVI Islam controversy The Pope Benedict XVI Islam controversy arose from a lecture delivered on 12 September 2006 by Pope Benedict XVI at the University of Regensburg in Germany. Many Islamic politicians and religious leaders registered protest against what they said was an insulting mischaracterization of Islam, contained in the quotation by the Pope of the following passage: After the Pope's comments were known throughout the Arab world, several churches were bombed by insurgent groups. A previously unknown Baghdad-based group, Kataab Ashbal Al-Islam Al-Salafi (Islamic Salafist Boy Scout Battalions)AshbƒÅl has been mistranslated in the media as Boy Scout. The Dictionary of Modern Written Arabic defines shibl (plural ashbƒÅl ÿßÿ¥ÿ®ÿßŸÑ) as meaning \\"lion cub; a capable young man, brave youth, young athlete.\\" Compare with Ashbal Saddam (Saddam's Lion Cubs). threatened to kill all Christians in Iraq if the Pope does not apologize to Muhammad within three days. Christian Leaders in Iraq have asked their parishioners not to leave their homes, after two Assyrians were stabbed and killed in Baghdad. There have been reports of writing on Assyrian church doors stating \\"If the Pope does not apologise, we will bomb all churches, kill more Christians and steal their property and money.\\" The Iraqi militia Jaish al-Mujahedin (Holy Warriors' Army) announced its intention to \\"destroy their cross in the heart of Rome‚Ä¶ and to hit the Vatican.\\"\\"Vatikan versch√§rft Sicherheitsvorkehrungen\\", Der Spiegel, 16 September 2006 Despite the Pope's comments dying down in the media, attacks on Assyrian Christians continued and on 9 October Islamic extremist group kidnapped priest Paulos Iskander in Mosul. Iskander's church as well as several other churches placed 30 large posters around the city to distance themselves from the Pope's words. The relatives of the Christian priest who was beheaded three days later in Mosul, have said that his Muslim captors had demanded his church condemn the pope's recent comments about Islam and pay a $350,000 ransom. Ancient Assyrian objects and buildings have been labeled by Kurdish authorities as Kurdish. Also many names of places and towns have been changed to Kurdish names. Observers have also reported that Kurdish forces often used to practice their shooting on important Assyrian cultural heritage sites. Massacres and harassment since 2003 Massacres, ethnic cleansing, and harassment has increased since 2003, according to a 73-page report by the Assyrian International News Agency, released in summer 2007. On 6 January 2008 (the Feast of Epiphany) five Assyrian churches, one Armenian church, and a monastery in Mosul and Baghdad were coordinately attacked with multiple car bombs.ÿπÿßÿ¨ŸÑ ÿ≥ŸÑÿ≥ŸÑÿ© ÿ™ŸÅÿ¨Ÿäÿ±ÿßÿ™ ÿ™ÿ∑ÿßŸÑ ŸÉŸÜÿßÿ¶ÿ≥ ŸÅŸä ÿ®ÿ∫ÿØÿßÿØ ŸàÿßŸÑŸÖŸàÿµŸÑ Iraqi vice- president Tariq al-Hashimi expressed his \\"closeness to Christians\\", whom he called \\"brothers\\" in the face of this \\"attack that changed their joy to sadness and anxiety\\". Two days later, on 8 January, two more churches were bombed in the city of Kirkuk; the Chaldean Cathedral of Kirkuk and the ACOE Maar Afram Church, wounding three bystanders. Since the start of the Iraq War, there have been at least 46 churches and monasteries bombed. Threats on population Leaders of Iraq's Christian community estimate that over two- thirds of the country's Christian population may have fled the country or been internally displaced since the US-led invasion in 2003. While exact numbers are unknown, reports suggest that whole neighborhoods of Christians have left the cities of Baghdad and Al-Basrah, and that both Sunni and Shiite insurgent groups and militias have threatened Christians. Religious official targets Including those mentioned already, many other Assyrian religious officials have been targeted since 2003. Chaldean Catholic priest Ragheed Aziz Ganni was murdered together with subdeacons Basman Yousef Dawid, Wahid Hanna Isho, and Gassan Isam Bidawed after the Sunday evening Eucharist at Mosul's Holy Spirit Chaldean Church. Paulos Faraj Rahho, Chaldean Catholic archbishop of Mosul, was found in a shallow grave in the northern city two weeks after he was kidnapped. Youssef Adel, a Syriac Orthodox priest with Saint Peter's Church in Baghdad's Karada neighbourhood, was killed by gunmen while travelling in a car on 5 April 2008.Christian priest shot dead in Baghdad, AFP On 11 April, President Bush was interviewed by Cliff Kincaid of the EWTN Global Catholic Network; after being informed about the deteriorating situation of the Assyrians; President Bush was quoted as saying \\"This is a Muslim government that has failed to protect the Christians. In fact, it discriminates against them....It‚Äôs time to order U.S. troops to protect Christian churches and believers.\\" Growth of Assyrian security forces In October 2008, National Public Radio reported that a new phenomenon was spreading through the Assyrian Christian towns and villages of northern Iraq: Christian security forces, organized through their local churches, began manning checkpoints and working with the Iraqi police. Father Daoud Suleiman from the Assyrian town of Bartella testified that without the Christian militias, Bartella and other villages would be in much worse shape than they are now. A mysterious, media-shy, and wealthy Assyrian Sarkis Aghajan Mamendo was a key player in this apparently straightforward story of a small beleaguered minority learning to stand up for itself once more. He is the finance minister for the Kurdish regional government, and he is a member of the Kurdish Democratic Party believed to be close to Kurdish Prime Minister Nechirvan Barzani. New churches are going up across the north, paid for, everyone says, by Sarkis. New schools, more than 300 new apartments for displaced Christian families from the south, an Assyrian cultural center in Bartella‚Äîthe list goes on.NPR Reports on Iraqi Christians forming Security Forces Population The majority of the ancestral villages of the Assyrian population in Iraq lie in the Kurdistan Region of Iraq, where the bulk of the current Assyrian population is. In modern times, Assyrians, for whom no reliable census figures exist in Iraq (as they do not for Kurds, Turkmen, Armenians, Yazidi, Shabaks or Mandeans), have been doubly mistreated; first by their Kurdish neighbours who outnumber them greatly, then by Saddam Hussein's Ba'athist regime. Assyrians were deprived of their ethnic, cultural and national rights while at the same time the Ba'athist regime tried to co-opt their history. In northern Iraq today, a similar pattern was claimed to have emerging as Kurdistan Regional Government attempt to allegedly rewrite the history of the region to give it a Kurdish flavor and diminish its historic and far older Assyrian heritage. Statistics A 1950 CIA numbers report on Iraq estimated 98,000 Chaldeans, 30,000 Nestorians, 25,000 Syriac Catholics and 12,000 Jacobites. The report used the name Assyrians, in the ethnic sense, for Nestorians, and also noted that Assyrians may be members of the Chaldean and Protestant Churches. According to statistics gathered by the Roman Catholic Church when doing censuses of Chaldean Catholic diocese in Iraq in 2012 and 2013, Chaldo-Assyrians in Iraq numbered 230,071 people.http://www.catholic-hierarchy.org/rite/dch2.html A population project run by Shlama Foundation has determined the Assyrian population of Iraq to be at a total of 151,047 (as of March 2020).

Tejel, J., Writing the Modern History of Iraq: Historiographical and Political Challenges, World Scientific, 2012, p. 476 He relocated to Rome (1939-1940), but again his studies were interrupted by war, forcing him to return to Baghdad. At war's end, he enrolled at the Slade School, London (1946-1948), Jabra, J.I., Art in Iraq Today, London, Embassy of the Republic of Iraq, 1966, p. 1 Online: where he was heavily influenced by Western artists such as Pablo Picasso and Henry Moore. In England, he met an artist, Lorna, a native of Sheffield, and the pair were married in 1950.Ibrahimi Collection, Online: During the hiatus in his studies, Saleem was employed at the Directorate of Antiquities in Baghdad between 1940‚Äì1945 and was appointed head of the Sculpture Department at the Institute of Fine Arts in Baghdad, a position he retained until his death in 1961.Shabout, N., \\"Jewad Selim: On Abstraction and Symbolism,\\" in Mathaf Encyclopedia of Modern Art and the Arab World, Online: His work exposed him to Iraq's ancient art traditions, and he consciously sought to discover the possibilities of combining ancient motifs with within the modern abstract art he had observed in Europe.Ali, W., Modern Islamic Art: Development and Continuity, University of Florida Press, 1997, p.45 His wife, Lorna Saleem, noted that he was fascinated with ancient Egyptian and Mesopotamian sculptures. She explained:Cited in: Bashkin, O., The Other Iraq: Pluralism and Culture in Hashemite Iraq, Stanford University Press, 2008, p. 131 He is generally credited with being the first Iraqi artist to draw on his heritage and guide local artists towards a distinctly Iraqi style.Zuhur, S. (ed.), Colors of Enchantment: Theater, Dance, Music, and the Visual Arts of the Middle East, I.B.Tauris, 2001, p. 390 Iraq in the 1930s had few art museums or galleries. Accordingly, Saleem's first solo exhibition was held in the private home of prominent Iraqi architect, Mohamed Makiya.Sabrah,S.A. and Ali, M.,\\" Iraqi Artwork Red List: A Partial List of the Artworks Missing from the National Museum of Modern Art, Baghdad, Iraq, 2010, p. 10 In 1944, he was invited to work with historical masterpieces and to assist archaeologists in any restoration work that was necessary. These encounters with ancient heritage fostered a strong sense of pride in Iraq's ancient art heritage and questions about the nexus between 'heritage' and 'contemporary' art which would preoccupy the artist and philosopher for the rest of his working life.Stone, P.G. and Bajjaly, J.G., The Destruction of Cultural Heritage in Iraq, Boydell & Brewer Ltd, 2008, p. 293 In 1951, he gave a public lecture in which he spoke critically and bitterly about public taste in Iraq. For this, Saleem became known as an 'enemy of the people.' Yet within two decades, Saleem was praised by the Iraqi elite and his reputation was mythologised by poets and writers.Al-Khalil, S. and Makiya, K., The Monument: Art, Vulgarity, and Responsibility in Iraq, University of California Press, 1991, p. 80 He was one of the founders of the Jama'et Baghdad lil Fen al-Hadith (The Baghdad Modern Art Group, founded in 1951) with fellow artist Shakir Hassan Al Said and Mohammed Ghani Hikmat (1929-2011); a group which attempted to combine ancient Iraqi art traditions with modern European techniques. The group's mantra, was istilham al-turath ‚Äì seeking inspiration from tradition.Shabout, N., \\"Jewad Selim: On Abstraction and Symbolism,\\" in Mathaf Encyclopedia of Modern Art and the Arab World, Online: http://www.encyclopedia.mathaf.org.qa/en/essays/Pages/Jewad-Selim,-On- Abstraction-and-Symbolism.aspx Saleem, along with al-Said and other members of the Modern Baghdad group were inspired by the 13th-century Baghdad School and the work of ancient calligraphers and illustrators such as Yahya Al-Wasiti who was active in Baghdad in the 1230s. They believed that the Mongol invasion of 1258 represented a \\"break in the chain of pictorial Iraqi art\\"Shabout, N., \\"Jewad Selim: On Abstraction and Symbolism,\\" in Mathaf Encyclopedia of Modern Art and the Arab World, Online and wanted to recover lost traditions.Ulrike al-Khamis, ‚ÄúAn Historical Overview 1900s-1990s,‚Äù in: Maysaloun, F.

This group accomplished a great deal in terms of popularising modern art by giving Iraqis a sense of national pride in their ancient art heritage.Al-Khalil, S. and Makiya, K., The Monument: Art, Vulgarity, and Responsibility in Iraq, University of California Press, 1991, p. 80 Saleem first came to the attention of international audiences in 1952 when his competition entry, The Unknown Political Prisoner was one of 80 selected out of 3,500 entries for exhibition at the Tate Gallery in London and was the only Arab artist to be included in the exhibition. The following year he toured the United States and his work was well received.Al-Khalil, S. and Makiya, K., The Monument: Art, Vulgarity, and Responsibility in Iraq, University of California Press, 1991, p. 95 Although he worked both as a painter and sculptor, he always had misgivings about practising both simultaneously. Towards the end of the 1950s, he made the decision to focus exclusively on sculpture.Ali, W., Modern Islamic Art: Development and Continuity, University of Florida Press, 1997, p. 45; Shabout, N.M., Modern Arab Art: Formation of Arab Aesthetics, University of Florida Press, 2007, p. 29 In 1959, shortly after Iraq gained independence, Saleem was commissioned by the new leader of the republic, Brigadier General 'Abd al-Karim Qasim to create a monument for the city centre that would be a celebration to Iraq's declaration of independence. It was to be situated in the heart of Baghdad's central business district, overlooking Liberation Square and Jamhouriyya Bridge. The sculptor understood that the monument would need to be a symbol of a new world, and designed a work that was a narrative of the 1958 revolution, but that also paid homage to Iraq's deep art history by including Abassid and Babylonian wall-reliefs, producing a sculpture that was both \\"strikingly modern\\" yet also referenced tradition.Al-Khalil, S. and Makiya, K., The Monument: Art, Vulgarity, and Responsibility in Iraq, University of California Press, 1991, p. 83 Nasb al-Hurriyah (Monument of Freedom), Baghdad, a sculpture by Jawad Saleem, 1959-1961 Saleem laboured on the project under difficult conditions, resisting all attempts by Qasim to have his image incorporated.Al-Khalil, S. and Makiya, K., The Monument: Art, Vulgarity, and Responsibility in Iraq, University of California Press, 1991, p. 82 Initially, Saleem had wanted the sculpture to be at ground level, but the architect, Rifa'at Chadirchi insisted that it be elevated so that it would look more 'monumental'. As a result, the completed work faces the busy traffic rather than people walking in the adjacent gardens. Although the monument was Saleem's design, he did not see it through to completion; following his premature death, the project was completed in 1961 by Saleem's friend, Mohammed Ghani Hikmat, who had previously been assisting on the project by casting the bronze figures.Greenberg, N., \\"Political Modernism, JabrƒÅ, and the Baghdad Modern Art Group,\\" CLCWeb: Comparative Literature and Culture, Vol. 12, No. 2, 2010, Online: https://docs.lib.purdue.edu/cgi/viewcontent.cgi?article=1603&context;=clcweb, DOI: 10.7771/1481-4374.160; Floyd, T., \\"Mohammed Ghani Hikmat,\\" [Biographical Notes] in: Mathaf Encyclopedia of Modern Art and the Islamic World, Online: http://www.encyclopedia.mathaf.org.qa/en/bios/Pages/Mohammed-Ghani-Hikmat.aspx The completed monument, known as Nasb al-Hurriyah (Monument of Freedom), has survived various attempts to have it pulled down and is one of Baghdad's most iconic public works.Dabrowska, K. and Hann, G., Iraq Then and Now: A Guide to the Country and Its People, Bradt Travel Guides, 2008, p. 215 Saleem is credited as being the most influential artist in Iraq's modern art movement and is said to have brought a 'modern vision' to Iraq.Stone, P.G. and Bajjaly, J.G., The Destruction of Cultural Heritage in Iraq, Boydell & Brewer Ltd, 2008, p. 293 The Iraqi intellectual, Jabra Ibrahim Jabra wrote of him: Saleem suffered a heart attack and died in the Republican Hospital on 23 January, 1961 aged 42 years. His wife, Lorna was with him, and he was surrounded by his friends from the arts community; Hafidh al-Droubi, Ismail al-Sheikhli, Said Shaker, Mohammed Abdel Wahab, Bahir Faeq, Salem Damluji and Khalid Al-Qasab as well as his former student and colleague, Khaled al-Rahal who was reduced to tears and made a death mask of his mentor, the man to whom he had been utterly devoted during his lifetime. Aal-Qasab, \\"Jawad Salim is Running Behind the Horizon,\\" Al Iraq, Online: Scholars have suggested that his premature death can be attributed, at least in part, to the stresses of completing the Nasb al-Hurriyah sculpture.

The highway connects the Alabama state line southwest of Franklin with the Peachtree City area, via Franklin and Newnan. Route description SR 34 begins at the Alabama state line, southwest of Waresville, in Heard County, where the roadway continues to the southwest as Alabama State Route 22 (SR 22). In a curving fashion, it heads northeast to an intersection with the northern terminus of SR 219\\\\. It continues to the northeast and enters Franklin. Just inside the city limits, it begins a concurrency with SR 100\\\\. Just before the concurrency ends, the two highways cross over the Chattahoochee River on the Pleasant Theodore McCutchen Sr. Bridge. On the eastern side of the river, they diverge, with SR 34 continuing to the northeast and has an interchange with US 27/SR 1\\\\. The highway travels through a portion of Bush Head Shoals State Park. Then, it passes Turners Lake and Heard Wesley Cemetery, before entering Coweta County. The highway passes Josephs Lake and Dent Chapel Cemetery, before reaching the Rock Cabin Lake area. Right by the lake, it passes Emory Chapel Cemetery. Farther along, it curves to the east-northeast. Then, it passes Mountain Lake. Less than later, it meets the western terminus of SR 34 Byp. (Newnan By-Pass Road). The highway enters Newnan, where it intersects US 27 Alt./SR 16 (Temple Avenue). The three highways head concurrent toward the main part of town. They pass Temple Avenue Recreation Complex. In downtown, they intersect US 29/SR 14 (Jackson Street). All five highways head south. At Posey Place, SR 34 departs the concurrency and intersects the northbound lanes, where it rejoins the concurrency to the north. At Clark Street, SR 34 splits off to the northeast. A few miles farther, it meets the eastern terminus of SR 34 Byp. (this time known as Millard Farmer Industrial Boulevard. Then, it has an interchange with Interstate 85 (I-85). After that, it leaves Newnan and travels in a fairly eastern routing. In Thomas Crossroads is an intersection with SR 154 (Sharpsburg‚ÄìMcCollum Road). SR 34 curves to the east-southeast and reaches its eastern terminus, an intersection with SR 54 just west of Peachtree City. The only portion of SR 34 that is part of the National Highway System, a system of routes determined to be the most important for the nation's economy, mobility, and defense, is from the central part of Newnan to its eastern terminus. History SR 34 was established between October 1929 and June 1930, from the Alabama state line west-southwest of Franklin, east-northeast to Newnan. Between November 1946 and February 1948, it was extended east-northeast to SR 54, at its current eastern terminus. Between August 1950 and January 1952, the entire path of SR 34 was hard surfaced. Major intersections Special routes =Franklin bypass route= State Route 34 Bypass (SR 34 Byp.) was a bypass of SR 34 that existed completely within the city limits of Franklin. In 1949, it was established from US 27/SR 1/SR 100 in the southeastern part of the city to SR 34 in the northeastern part. In 1983, it was decommissioned. =Newnan bypass route= State Route 34 Bypass (SR 34 Byp.) is a bypass route of SR 34 that exists entirely within the central part of Coweta County. Approximately half of the highway is located in the city limits of Newnan. Most of the bypass functions as a truck route for US 27 Alt./US 29/SR 14/SR 16/SR 34 It begins at an intersection with the SR 34 mainline (Franklin Road) west of Newnan. It heads north, has an interchange with Welcome Road, and curves to the east-northeast and intersects US 27 Alt./SR 16 (Temple Avenue) northwest of the city. Then, it continues to an intersection with the southern terminus of SR 70 (Roscoe Road), on the northern edge of the city. SR 34 Byp. curves to the southeast and intersects US 29/SR 14 (Jackson Street). It curves its way through the city, until it meets its eastern terminus, a second intersection with the SR 34 mainline (Bullsboro Drive), in the eastern part of the city. The entire length of SR 34 is included as part of the National Highway System, a system of routes determined to be the most important for the nation's economy, mobility, and defense. In 1984, a northern bypass of Newnan was established from US 29/SR 14 just north of the city to SR 34 just northeast of it. However, it was unnumbered. The next year, a western extension of this bypass, designated as SR 747, was proposed to have a western terminus at SR 34 west of the city. In 1986, this bypass was then proposed as SR 34 Byp. The next year, it was re-proposed as SR 747. In 1988, it was completed as SR 747 from US 27 Alt./SR 16 to US 29/SR 14. The next year, this bypass was entirely redesignated as SR 34 Byp.

Overview Written and composed by Wonder's mentors, Clarence Paul and Henry Cosby, \\"Fingertips\\" was originally a jazz instrumental recorded for Wonder's first studio album, The Jazz Soul of Little Stevie. The live version of the song was recorded in 1963 during a Motortown Revue performance at the Regal Theater in Chicago, Illinois. Containing only a few stanzas of improvised lyrics, \\"Fingertips\\" is essentially an instrumental piece, meant to showcase Wonder's talents on the bongos and the harmonica. =\\"Part 2\\"= The edit point that begins \\"Part 2\\" of \\"Fingertips\\" is when Wonder shouts \\"Everybody say 'yeah!'\\", initiating a call-and-response exchange with the audience. After a couple of sung verses, each followed by Wonder's brief harmonica playing (solos accompanied only by the audience's rhythmic clapping), Wonder appears to bring things to a conclusion. On the night of the recording, Wonder, as usual started to leave the stage and the band went into the exit music, as comedian Bill Murray (known professionally as Winehead Willie) exhorted the crowd to \\"give him a hand\\"; however, Stevie unexpectedly changed his mind, returning to sing the \\"goodbye\\" encore. The other musicians were caught out, and the bass players had changed over to prepare for the next act on the bill, usually slated as The Marvelettes (though some sources say Mary Wells was next). As Wonder moves into his impromptu encore, the new bass player, Joe Swift, having replaced Larry Moses, can be heard on the recording, yelling out: \\"What key? What key?\\" =Release= The live version of \\"Fingertips\\" was released on May 21, 1963 as a two-part single, with Part 2 (with the encore) as the B-side. The 707 mono features \\"Sunset\\" and \\"Contract on Love\\". By August, the single B-side had reached the top of both the Billboard Pop Singles and R&B; Singles charts. \\"Fingertips\\" was Motown's second number-one pop hit (following The Marvelettes' \\"Please Mr. Postman\\"), and launched the then 13-year-old Wonder to prominence. The single's success helped Wonder's live album, Recorded Live: The 12 Year Old Genius, reach number-one on the Billboard Pop Albums chart, making him the youngest artist to accomplish that feat. Because of Part 2's success, it would later feature on various compilation albums just as the full recording. Both the studio and live versions of the song featured drumming by Marvin Gaye, who had been playing drums for Wonder and other Motown artists and would become a big Motown star in his own right.

Located in Brackley, the school is on two sites (see history section): the former Secondary Modern site accommodates secondary schooling to Year Eleven, after which students transfer to the St John's site (the old MCS) for most of their lessons during the Sixth Form. Today the school has approximately 1,500 students, and averages 59% A*‚ÄìC at GCSE. Previously a boys' grammar school, then a voluntary controlled comprehensive school, it converted to academy status in January 2013. The St John's site is still owned by Magdalen College, Oxford, and they are represented on the governing body. History The site now occupied by the school was originally the Hospital of St. James and St. John, founded around 1150 by Robert le Bossu, Earl of Leicester. In 1484 it was given to Magdalen College, Oxford. By 1548 there was a school at the site, its initial purpose being to allow pupils of the college in Oxford to escape the plague affecting the city at the time. In September 1973 MCS merged with the Girls Grammar School (Brackley High) and Brackley Secondary Modern School to form a new comprehensive school on two sites, while the girls' school was converted into the new Southfield Primary school. This school has approximately 1500 students Chapel Formerly a chapel for the hospital of St. James and St. John, the earliest datable parts are late-12th century, although many parts are 13th century. The chapel underwent a major restoration between 1869‚Äì1870 by Buckeridge. It is constructed of stone rubble and is one of the largest school chapels, and the oldest school chapel still in use in England. It remains in regular use by the school, Church of England and local community.

The first was the original West Orange High School, built in 1898. It burned down in 1913, was rebuilt, and linked by a shared auditorium to Fairmount Avenue Elementary School. In 1912, the elementary school had been built behind the high school with its entrance on Fairmount Avenue. (At that time, Fairmount Avenue ran parallel to Gaston Street but it no longer exists.) In 1922, when a new high school was constructed on Northfield Avenue (now Seton Hall Prep), the old high school was transformed into Gaston Street Junior High School. Fairmount Avenue Elementary School remained the same. In the 1950s, Gaston Street Junior High School closed, and the building was transformed once again and became part of Fairmount Elementary School, and then later into the Board of Education offices. In 1972, Fairmount Elementary School dropped the \\"Avenue\\" from its name and it was moved to a new building on the corner of Northfield and Gregory Avenues (now the Golda Och Academy Lower School Campus). The Board of Education offices remained on Gaston Street and took over both old school buildings. In the late 1970s, both buildings were demolished and the Board of Education offices were relocated to Eagle Rock Avenue School. The Gaston Street/Fairmount Avenue land parcel became the site of the Fairmount House (now the John P. Renna Jr.) Senior Citizens Housing Complex. A small portion of the land became an extension of the parking lot for the adjacent Town Hall. *Eagle Rock Avenue Elementary School - Converted into new Board of Education offices. *Fairmount Elementary School - Sold and became Solomon Schechter Day School Lower Campus (Jewish). *West Orange High School (Northfield Avenue) - Sold and became Seton Hall Preparatory School (Catholic). *West Orange Mountain High School - Built in 1960 as a second high school, located behind Abraham Lincoln Junior High School with its entrance on Conforti Avenue. It became the \\"new\\" West Orange High School when the two high schools merged in 1984. *Abraham Lincoln Junior High School - On Pleasant Valley Way, it was adjacent and connected to West Orange Mountain High School through a pair of corridor/bridges. The two schools shared an auditorium. Later, when West Orange Mountain High School became the \\"new\\" West Orange High, Lincoln was closed and the building absorbed by the \\"new\\" high school in order to enlarge it.

While small amounts of fat commonly occur in the blood after a bone fracture, fat embolism syndrome is rare. The condition was first diagnosed in 1862 by Zenker. Signs and symptoms Symptoms of fat embolism syndrome (FES) can start from 12 hours to 3 days after diagnosis of the underlying clinical disease. The three most characteristic features are: respiratory distress, neurological features, and skin petechiae. Respiratory distress (present in 75% of the cases) can vary from mild distress which requires supplemental oxygen to severe distress which requires mechanical ventilation. For neurologic features, those who have FES may become lethargic, restless, with a drop in glasgow coma scale (GCS) due to cerebral oedema rather than cerebral ischaemia. Therefore, neurological signs are not lateralised to one side of the body. In the severe form of cerebral odema, a person may become unresponsive. Petechiae rash usually happens in 50% of the patients. Such skin manifestation is temporary and can disappear within one day. The fat embolism syndrome can be divided into three types: * Subclinical FES - It manifests as reduced partial pressure of oxygen (PaO2) on arterial blood gas (ABG) with deranged blood parameters (reduced haemoglobin or thrombocytopenia) associated with fever, pain, discomfort, tachypnoea, tachycardia. However, there is no respiratory distress. However, it is often confused with post-operative symptoms of fever, pain, and discomfort. * Subacute FES (non-fulminant FES) - The three characteristic features of fat embolism are present: respiratory distress, neurological signs, and skin petechiae. Petechiae are seen on the chest, axilla, shoulder, and mouth. Occulsion of dermal capillaries by the fat emboli resulted in petechial rash. Petechiae rash occurs in 50 to 60% of the cases. Neurologic signs such as confusion, stupor, and coma maybe present. These are usually temporary and does not happen on one side of the body. Respiratory distress can be mild and tend to improve on the third day. Retinal changes similar to Purtscher's retinopathy may also be present. Retinal changes happens in 50% of the patients with FES. These are the cotton wool exudates and small haemorrhages along the retinal vessels and macula. * Fulminant FES - This type of FES is much rarer than the above two types. It usually happens within the first few hours of the injury. The three characteristics of FES existed in the most severe form. Cause of death is usually due to acute right heart failure. Causes Orthopaedic injuries especially fractures of the long bones are the most common cause of fat embolism syndrome (FES). The rates of fat embolism in long bone fractures varies from 1% to 30%. The mortality rate of fat-embolism syndrome is approximately 10‚Äì20%. However, fat globules have been detected in 67% of those with orthopaedic trauma and can reach as high as 95% if the blood is sampled near the fracture site. As the early operative fixation of long bone fractures become a common practice, the incidence of FES has been reduced to between 0.9% and 11%. Osteomyelitis Other rare causes of fat embolism syndrome are: * Severe burns * Liver injury * Closed chest cardiac massage (during cardiopulmonary resuscitation) * Bone marrow transplantation * Liposuction * Parenteral lipid infusion * Decompression sickness * Extracorporeal circulation * Acute haemorrhagic pancreatitis * Alcoholic liver disease * Prolonged corticosteriod therapy * Sickle cell disease * Carbon tetrachloride poisoning * Osteomyelitis Pathophysiology Once fat particles enter the blood circulation, it can lodge at various sites of the body, most commonly in the lungs (up to 75% of the cases). However, it can also enter the brain, skin, eyes, kidneys, liver, and heart circulation, causing capillary damage, and subsequently organ damage in these areas. There are two theories that describe the formation of a fat embolus: * Mechanical theory - Following trauma, fat is released directly from the bone marrow into the circulation. This is because after trauma, an elevated pressure in the medullary cavity (central cavity of the bone where the bone marrow are stored) of the bone causes the release of fat globules into venous system supplying the bone. This explains the obstruction of the fat emboli in the lung capillaries. However, it does not explain the fat embolism in other parts of the body (brain, skin, heart, and eyes) because the small diameters of lung capillaries does not allow the fat emboli to pass through lung circulation back into the left ventricle of the heart to be pumped throughout the body. For those without a patent foramen ovale (a hole communicating the right atrium directly to the left atrium of the heart), fat emboli still can be found in other parts of the body apart from the lungs. If fat globules obstructs 80% of the lung capillary network, it will cause acute right heart failure which resulted in death. Obstruction of fat globules in the lung capillaries can cause an increase in lung capillary pressures. This increase in pressure causes lung to be more stiff, and increases the workload of the right heart. The back pressure on the right heart causes right heart dilatation through cor pulmonale which causes acute right heart failure. * Biochemical theory - Following trauma, an inflammation causes bone marrow to liberate fatty acids into the venous circulation. This is achieved through the increased activity of lipoprotein lipase which break down triglycerides into free fatty acids. Both the release of fatty acids and the inflammation causes damage to the capillary beds of the lungs and other organs, causing interstitial lung disease, chemical pneumonitis, and acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS). This theory can help to explain non-traumatic causes of fat embolism. Diagnosis Separator for hematocrit Fat embolism is presence of fat particles in the micro- circulation of the body. Meanwhile, fat embolism syndrome is the clinical manifestation as the result of fat particles lodging in the body micro- circulation. There are three major diagnostic criteria proposed for fat embolism syndrome, however, none of them are validated and accepted universally. However, Gurd and Wilson's criteria for fat embolism become more commonly used when compared to the other two diagnostic criteria. =Gurd and Wilson's criteria= Major criteria * Axillary or subconjunctival petechiae * Hypoxaemia PaO2 <60 mm Hg, FIO2 = 0.4 * Central nervous system depression disproportionate to hypoxaemia * Pulmonary oedema Minor criteria * Tachycardia more than 110 beats per minute * Pyrexia more than 38.5 ¬∞C * Fat globules present in urine * Changes in renal function (reduced urine output) * Drop in haemoglobin values (more than 20% of the value upon admission) * Drop in haematocrit values * Drop in platelet values (more than 50% of the value upon admission) * Increasing erythrocyte sedimentation rate (ESR) (greater than 71 mm per hour) * Fat globules present in the sputum * Emboli present in the retina on fundoscopy A least two positive major criteria plus one minor criteria or four positive minor criteria are suggestive of fat embolism syndrome. Fat embolism syndrome is a clinical diagnosis. There are no laboratory tests sensitive or specific enough to diagnose FES. Such laboratory tests are only used to support the clinical diagnosis only. Chest X-ray may show diffuse interstitial infiltrates while chest CT scan will show diffuse vascular congestion and pulmonary oedema. Bronchoalveolar lavage has been proposed to look for fat droplets in alveolar macrophages however it is time consuming and is not specific to fat embolism syndrome. Looking for fat globules in sputum and urine is also not specific enough to diagnose FES. Prevention For those treated conservatively with immobilisation of long bone fractures, the incidence of FES is 22%. Early operative fixation of long bone fractures can reduce the incidence of FES especially with the usage of internal fixation devices. Patients undergoing urgent fixation of long bone fractures has a rate of 7% of acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS) when compared to those undergoing fixation after 24 hours (39% with ARDS). However, movement of the fracture ends of the long bones during the operative fixation can cause transient increase of fat emboli in the blood circulation. Cytokines are persistently elevated if the long bone fractures is treated conservatively using immobilisation. The cytokine levels would return to normal after operative fixation. Although ream nailing increases pressure in the medullary cavity of the long bones, it does not increase the rates of FES. Other methods such as drilling of holes in the bony cortex, lavaging bone marrow prior to fixation, and the use of tourniquets to prevent embolisation have not been shown to reduce the rates of FES. Corticosteroid therapy such as methylprednisolone (6 to 90 mg/kg) has been proposed for the treatment of FES, however, it is controversial. Corticosteroid can be used to limit free fatty acid levels, stabilising membranes, and inhibit leukocyte aggregation. A meta- analysis conducted in 2009 reported prophylactic corticosteroids can reduce the risk of FES by 77%. However, there is no difference in mortality, infection, and avascular necrosis when compared to the control group. However, a randomised trial conducted in 2004 reported no differences in FES incidence when comparing treatment with the control group. Administration of corticosteroids for 2 to 3 days is not associated with increased rates of infection. However, there is insufficient data to support the use of methyprednisolone once FES is established. Heparin has been used in the prevention of venous thrombosis in post-operative patients; however its regular use in those with FES has been contraindicated due to increase risk of bleeding in those suffering from polytrauma. Placement of inferior vena cava filters has been proposed to reduce the amount of emboli going into the lung vascular system, however, this method has not been studied in detail. Treatment Serum albumin Once FES develops, the person should be admitted into intensive care unit (ICU), preferably with central venous pressure (CVP) monitoring. CVP monitoring would be helpful to guide the volume resuscitation. Supportive treatment is the only proven treatment method. Supplemental oxygen can be given if a person has mild respiratory distress. However, if a person has severe respiratory distress, either continuous positive pressure ventilation (CPAP), or mechanical ventilation using positive end-expiratory pressure (PEEP) may be indicated. Fluid replacement is required to prevent shock. Volume resuscitation with human albumin is recommended because it can restore blood volume in the circulatory system while also binds to free fatty acids in order to reduce lung injuries. In severe cases, dobutamine should be used to support the right ventricular failure. Frequent Glasgow coma scale (GCS) charting is required to assess the neurological progression of a person with FES. A placement of intracranial pressure monitor may be helpful to direct the treatment of cerebral odema. History In 1861, Zenker first reported on the autopsy findings of fat droplets found in the lungs of a railway worker who died due to severe thoraco-abdominal crush injury. In 1873, Bergmann diagnosed fat embolism clinically in a patient with fractured femur. In 1970, Gurd defined the characteristics of this phenomenon. Gurd later modified the fat embolism criteria together with Wilson, thus producing Gurd and Wilson's criteria for fat embolism syndrome in 1974. In 1983, Schonfeld suggested a scoring system for the diagnosis of fat embolism syndrome. In 1987, Lindeque proposed another scoring system that diagnose fat embolism syndrome by using respiratory changes alone. However, none of them become universally accepted in the medical community.

PAX is held annually in Seattle, Boston, Philadelphia, and San Antonio in the United States; and Melbourne in Australia. PAX was originally created in 2004 by Jerry Holkins and Mike Krahulik, the authors of the Penny Arcade webcomic, because they wanted to attend a show exclusively for gaming. Defining characteristics of the shows include an opening keynote speech from an industry insider, game- culture inspired concerts, panels on game topics, exhibitor booths from both independent and major game developers and publishers, a LAN party multiplayer, tabletop gaming tournaments, and video game freeplay areas.  History  The first PAX, known at the time as the Penny Arcade Expo, was held on August 28‚Äì29, 2004, in Bellevue, Washington, at the Meydenbauer Center, and was attended by approximately 3,300 people. The event was then held annually in August, at the same venue, for the next two years. Attendance grew rapidly, with over 9,000 attendees in 2005, and over 19,000 in 2006. By 2007, the event had outgrown its previous venue, and moved to the Washington State Convention and Trade Center, with a total attendance of 39,000. Attendance continued to grow to 58,500 in 2008, and 60,750 in 2009, and 70,000 in 2011. The show stopped reporting attendance numbers in 2011, citing difficulties in tracking attendance in a multi-day event. PAX Prime 2013 was the first four-day PAX and took place from August 30 to September 2, 2013. Passes for PAX Prime 2013 sold out within six hours. =Expansion to additional cities= In 2010, Penny Arcade hosted its first event outside of Seattle. PAX East was held in Boston, from March 26‚Äì28, 2010, at the Hynes Convention Center. With an attendance of 52,290, PAX East rivaled the newly-dubbed \\"PAX Prime\\" in Washington, which saw 67,600 attendees in 2010. This venue was moved to Boston Convention and Exhibition Center in 2011. An agreement reached in early 2012 committed Boston as the home of PAX East until 2023. 2013 marked the first international expansion for PAX. PAX Australia 2013 was held July 19‚Äì21, 2013 at the Melbourne Showgrounds. The following year it moved to the Melbourne Convention and Exhibition Centre, where it has been confirmed to remain until at least 2019. The first PAX South was held in San Antonio, Texas at the Henry B. Gonzalez Convention Center on January 23‚Äì25, 2015. It set a PAX record for highest attendance for an inaugural year.PAX South Attendance Breaks Records. IGN. January 25, 2015. = New verticals = In 2011, Penny Arcade launched PAX Dev, a new event exclusive to the game developer community to \\"speak freely and focus entirely on their trade\\". Differentiating itself from other game developer events like GDC, PAX Dev does not allow press. 750 people attended in 2011. At PAX South 2017, Penny Arcade and ReedPOP announced that a new event type, PAX Unplugged, would be held on November 17‚Äì19, 2017 at the Pennsylvania Convention Center, in Philadelphia. The event was designed as a tabletop-exclusive convention, a gaming segment which was only incidental in other PAXes. = Name of PAX in Seattle = PAX was originally known as the \\"Penny Arcade Expo,\\" a Seattle-only event, but quickly became known by its acronym \\"PAX\\". As part of an expansion into new cities, Seattle's PAX was renamed \\"PAX Prime\\" in 2010. On November 18, 2015, it was silently confirmed that PAX Prime was being renamed to PAX West.  Activities  PAX consists of the following activities: * Freeplay, further broken into: Console, Classic Console, Handheld, PC, VR, and Tabletop. * Tournaments, further broken into: Console and Tabletop. Some PAXes feature additional tournaments hosted by vendors. * \\"Bring Your Own Computer\\" or BYOC, a LAN Party. * Panels, talks, signings, and similar events. * Concerts. * PAX Arena, an eSports tournament. * The Omegathon. * An Exhibition Hall, which includes game studios, merchandise, and the Indie Megabooth. = The Omegathon = Each PAX features an event called the \\"Omegathon,\\" a festival-long tournament consisting of a group of randomly selected attendees competing in a game bracket for a grand prize (which has varied from a large game bundle, to a trip to Japan, to a trip to any PAX in the world). The final round of the Omegathon makes up part of the closing ceremonies of PAX. Past games for the final round of the Omegathon have included Tetris, Pong, Halo 3, and skee-ball. = Enforcers = Early PAXes were largely run by a large group of volunteers, which the show calls \\"Enforcers\\". Now a paid role, most Enforcers are still not professional conference organizers or temps, but rather selected from an application available to attendees on the PAX website. Past shows =PAX 2004= Attendance at the Penny Arcade Expo On April 12, 2004, the authors of Penny Arcade announced PAX, the Penny Arcade Expo. PAX 2004 was a two-day event held at the Meydenbauer Center in Bellevue, Washington from August 28‚Äì29, which they hoped would turn into an annual event. Several exhibitors, including Warner Bros., Microsoft, Rooster Teeth and Ubisoft, showcased videos and playable demos of their upcoming games at PAX 2004. Microsoft allowed attendees to experience a multiplayer level of Halo 2 months before it hit stores in addition to a number of other Xbox games, while Ubisoft showed Tom Clancy's Splinter Cell: Chaos Theory and Ghost Recon 2. Warner Bros. brought all of its E3 assets for The Matrix Online to the show as well as several hands-on stations for the game. Included amongst the events of the first PAX were live musical performances by bands including The Minibosses, panels featuring Penny Arcade creators Mike Krahulik and Jerry Holkins as well as others in the video game industry, and the Omegathon, a contest where twenty contestants played a series of games for a chance at winning an excessively large video game collection worth in excess of $25,000. The contestants competed in a tabletop dice game called Diceland, Halo, Mario Kart: Double Dash!!, Dance Dance Revolution, Doom and the original home version of Pong. Sean Celaya defeated Kevin Potter in the final round to take home the grand prize becoming the PAX 2004 Omegathon champion. Penny Arcade claimed that precisely 1337 (or \\"leet\\") people pre-registered, to which Holkins mused, \\"though I ordinarily shun leet-speak that number clearly implies the blessing of gaming deities.\\" Roughly 3,300 people attended the event. =PAX 2005= PAX 2005 took place from August 26‚Äì28 at the Meydenbauer Center in Bellevue, Washington, where the first PAX was held. PAX 2005, unlike its predecessor, occupied the entire center, effectively doubling the usable floor space. Sponsors included Nintendo, Sony, Microsoft, Ubisoft and NCsoft, among others. Musical guests included the rock groups Minibosses and The NESkimos, self- professed \\"professional hardcore gangster rapper\\" mc chris, pianists Martin Leung and Connie Lin, nerdcore hiphopper MC Frontalot, and rap/funk group Optimus Rhyme, who performed live in two separate concerts in a massive theater. Events from PAX 2004 such as Pitch Your Game Idea, Red vs. Blue, a screening of the 1989 film The Wizard, and Penny Arcade Q&A; made encore appearances. New events included Beat The Pros and industry panels on online gaming, the video game marketing process, and controversy in the industry. Omegathon II was an even more elaborate affair than its predecessor. Krahulik said that, \\"[At PAX 2005] we will deliver an even bigger prize to the winner of the Omegathon.\\" It was revealed that prize would be the complete NES video game library, with a claimed value of at least $10,099.99. The prize was locked in a large cage in the exhibition room and also included two Star Wars- themed Alienware gaming PCs, one of which would go to the winner and the other to the runner-up. Contestants competed in the tabletop game Diceland, Mario Kart: Double Dash!!, Katamari Damacy, Karaoke Revolution, Quake, and the Atari 2600 game Combat. In a four-round match, Luke \\"Coreside\\" Armstrong defeated Will \\"LeRoy\\" Garroutte by a single point to win the best-of-three series 2-1-1 and take home the grand prize. In total, more than 9,000 gamers attended PAX 2005, almost triple the previous year's attendance. In response to Hurricane Katrina, Penny Arcade auctioned off the original pencil sketch of the PAX 2005 program cover on eBay with the profit to be given to the American Red Cross. It was sold to Christian Boggs for the final price of $8,700. Mr. Boggs also placed the winning bid of $20,000 on an auction to appear in a Penny Arcade comic strip at the 2005 Child's Play Charity Dinner. =PAX 2006= PAX 2006 expo area PAX 2006 was held from August 25‚Äì27. The Meydenbauer Center in Bellevue was again used as the venue, although the Tabletop Gaming area was moved offsite to the ballrooms at the nearby Red Lion hotel. Exhibit space at PAX 06 completely sold out in less than three months, with exhibitors including Nintendo, Microsoft, Ubisoft, Turbine Inc, Technomancer Press, NCSoft, Rooster Teeth, Creative Labs, Wizards of the Coast, and nVidia. According to Krahulik, there were 19,323 attendees. In the Omegathon, returning Omeganaut Will \\"LeRoy\\" Garroutte defeated David \\"Davertron\\" Davis in the final round of the Omegathon: head to head Tetris. LeRoy took away a brand new Scion car fully loaded with custom wheels, custom sound, LCD TV, Xbox 360 Premium, wireless controllers, and more. Davertron left with an Xbox 360 Premium and $500 Best Buy gift card, and returned as an Omeganaut in 2007. Holkins and PA business manager Robert Khoo led the way into Omegathon Round 5, Guitar Hero II. After playing through \\"Trippin on a Hole In a Paper Heart\\" on expert, Holkins smashed the guitar on stage. Krahulik and Holkins announced the first ever Penny Arcade video game titled On The Rain-Slick Precipice of Darkness: Episode One (which has since been released) and that the game would feature PA characters in episodic adventures. Details were few; when asked what the game was about, Holkins replied \\"Gabe. Tycho. And Cthulhu.\\" Krahulik and Holkins also announced a Penny Arcade annual scholarship, wherein one applicant with an intention to work in the game industry will be awarded $10,000 toward tuition expenses. Several game companies ran large prize tournaments and giveaways, including ArenaNet ($10,000 prize tourney), TableStar ($2,500 prize tourney), and Nvidia (several thousand dollars' worth of video cards). =PAX 2007= The fourth annual Penny Arcade Expo took place August 24‚Äì27 and experienced its first year within the confines of the of the Washington State Convention and Trade Center, more than doubling the space used to house PAX 2006. The massive Electronic Entertainment Expo (E3) was heavily downsized in 2006, which allowed the growing Penny Arcade Expo to become the biggest gamer festival in North America. Headliners for 2007's PAX included Nintendo, Microsoft and Sony, as well as others such as Ubisoft, NCSoft, THQ, Wizards of the Coast, Namco-Bandai, Vivendi, Konami and 45 other game publishers and developers. The 2007 keynote speech was delivered by Wil Wheaton. Attendance was reported at 39,000. For the final round of the Omegathon, Ryan \\"Accalon\\" Zack and Ben \\"MNC Dover\\" Gray competed on never before seen levels of Halo 3. Accalon won the grand prize, $5000 and a trip to the Tokyo Game Show. While the convention was housed on three of the floors of the Washington State Convention and Trade Center, the exhibition hall was certainly a busy place, featuring educational, video game and tabletop exhibitors, as well as retailers. The layout of the exhibition hall allowed visitors to peruse through a variety of displays, offering places where they could win their weight in Ramen noodles or enter the World's Smallest Dungeon, as hosted by Technomancer Press. =PAX 2008= PAX 2008 was held from August 29‚Äì31 at the Washington State Convention and Trade Center in Seattle, Washington, United States. The pre-show attendance estimate was 45,000, but this was soon thought to be a low guess. The final count of tickets sold was reported as 58,500, including 45,000 pre-registered tickets. The 2008 keynote was delivered by Ken Levine. The exhibition hall space was doubled from that of 2007, and tabletop gaming and an additional panel room was located in the Pike Street Annex of the convention center, the first time this space has been used for PAX. Despite the large increase in convention space, overflow still occurred at some events. New for 2008 was the PAX 10, a judged selection of self-submitted independent games on which attendees voted for a favorite. PAX 10 selections include Chronotron, the Maw, and Schizoid. To account for crowds, one empty exhibition room was explicitly reserved for the purpose of holding queues for the popular events in the main theater and other queues as needed. PAX 2008 came to a close with Fallout and Geko playing Vs. Excitebike, again for $5000 and a trip to the Tokyo Game Show; Geko was victorious. =PAX 2009= PAX 2009 was held from September 4‚Äì6 at the Washington State Convention and Trade Center in Seattle, Washington, United States. The total attendance of the convention was 60,750. The keynote speaker was Ron Gilbert. Musical guests included previous performers Anamanaguchi, Freezepop, Jonathan Coulton, Molly Lewis and MC Frontalot, along with first-time PAX appearances by Metroid Metal and Paul & Storm. For the first time, PAX occupied the entire convention center to accommodate an increase in attendees. Despite the increase in capacity, two days before the start of the show, PAX passes were sold out for the first time. Penny Arcade then announced that no passes would be sold on-site, however circumstances allowed on-site sales of 1,000 extra one-day passes each for Saturday and Sunday. After many attendees reported feeling sick, an H1N1 outbreak was later confirmed. At least 100 cases of H1N1 virus infections were confirmed in attendees after the convention. =PAX East 2010= The first PAX East was held from March 26‚Äì28 at the John B. Hynes Veterans Memorial Convention Center in Boston, Massachusetts, United States. A partnership was arranged with Reed Exhibitions to handle the logistics of the expo. This event, first announced in August 2008, was the first Penny Arcade Expo outside Washington state. On December 23, 2009, Mike Krahulik announced that the number of pre-registrants indicate PAX East Coast may exceed the number of attendees of any previous PAX. It was later announced in January 2010 that tickets for PAX East were close to selling out, and that attendance would most likely be capped as the previous PAX 2009, leaving little-to-no tickets being available at the door for the event. On February 3, 2010 Penny Arcade Expo's business head Robert Khoo updated his Twitter page with word that 3-day badges had sold out for the event. Later in February 2010 the lineup of exhibitors and panel discussions were announced for the full weekend, along with the announcement of the musical guests planned to perform at the event, such as Anamanaguchi, Metroid Metal, MC Frontalot, The Protomen, the Video Game Orchestra and Jonathan Coulton. The keynote speaker was Wil Wheaton, who had previously given the keynote at PAX Prime 2007. The final attendance count was revealed to be 52,290 attendees for the full weekend of PAX East. Plans have been confirmed to use the Boston Convention and Exhibition Center (BCEC) for future PAX East conventions, likely due to complaints of overcrowding and cramped event halls at the much smaller Hynes Convention Center. Penny Arcade has signed an agreement to keep the show in Boston through 2013. =PAX Prime 2010= PAX Prime 2010 was held from September 3‚Äì5 at the Washington State Convention and Trade Center in Seattle, Washington, United States. Attendance was reported at 67,600, compared to that of PAX Prime 2009's 60,750. The keynote was given by Warren Spector. Musical guests included Anamanaguchi, Jonathan Coulton, MC Frontalot, Metroid Metal, Minibosses, Paul and Storm, Martin O'Donnell, and The Protomen. For the first time since occupying the Washington State Convention and Trade Center, PAX Prime 2010 included events at offsite locations. Instead of occupying just the exposition hall at the Center, the keynote speech, large panels, and concerts were held at Benaroya Hall. The Pike St. Annex (since renamed to The Conference Center) was used (as it was in 2007), as well as the registration and one panel room located at the nearby Sheraton. These changes allowed PAX Prime 2010's expo hall to double in size vs. 2009. Notable games included Star Wars: The Old Republic, Duke Nukem Forever, Portal 2, League of Legends, Guild Wars 2, Marvel vs. Capcom 3: Fate of Two Worlds, Mortal Kombat, Sonic Colors, Epic Mickey, and Halo: Reach. =PAX East 2011= PAX East 2011 was held from March 11‚Äì13 at the Boston Convention and Exhibition Center in Boston, Massachusetts, United States. The BCEC boasts a total area of , over the Hynes' [ including the theater and meeting rooms]. The year's musical guests included Jonathan Coulton, MC Frontalot, Metroid Metal, Paul and Storm, The Protomen, and the Video Game Orchestra. The keynote speaker was Jane McGonigal. =PAX Dev 2011= Being held for the first time in 2011, PAX Dev is an event exclusive to the game development community. It took place on the two days prior to PAX Prime 2011, August 24 and 25, at the Sheraton Seattle Hotel. There were 750 attendees, all of whom are involved in game development. Press were not allowed to attend the event. =PAX Prime 2011= PAX Prime 2011 was held from August 26‚Äì28 at the Washington State Convention and Trade Center in Seattle, Washington, United States. The event brought in over 70,000 attendees, breaking the attendance record set at PAX East 2011 and making it the largest PAX to date. The keynote was delivered by David Jaffe. Musical guests included the familiar performances of The MiniBosses, Metroid Metal, MC Frontalot, Paul & Storm, Jonathan Coulton. In addition, Supercommuter and the Video Game Orchestra made debut performances. Notable events included Halo Fest - a celebration of the first 10 years of Halo history. =PAX East 2012= PAX East 2012 expo area PAX East 2012 was held from April 6‚Äì8 at the Boston Convention and Exhibition Center in Boston, Massachusetts, United States. All of the passes sold out except for single-day Sunday passes (due to the event being held on Easter Weekend). The Exhibition Hall held over 160 booths, including game design companies such as Riot Games and Electronic Arts, hardware companies such as Alienware/Dell and Xbox (Microsoft), and other various companies. PAX East also held a console freeplay area, where attendees could play games such as Deus Ex: Human Revolution, Dance Central 2, Tony Hawk Ride, and Rock Band Blitz, and various console tournaments for games such as Super Smash Bros Brawl, Tetris Splash, and Halo Reach. There was a PC freeplay area, where games such as Battlefield 3, League of Legends, and Minecraft could be played, and PC tournaments for Magic Online, League of Legends, and Starcraft 2.

In August 2015, the school moved to its new purpose built campus to the south of the town. History Founded as Ellon Public School, the building was opened on 22 May 1876. It was responsible for the education of both primary and secondary students; in 1962 the two were split into separate sites.History of Ellon Academy Ellon Public School was overseen by headmaster William Cooper. It had 6 classrooms, male and female. During the early years, the overcrowding problem, that has haunted the school for years, started to become clear, and it was decided that a second storey would be built. During the 24-year wait for the construction to begin, Ellon Public School became Ellon Secondary School. The second floor was completed in 1911. It turned out to be only a temporary cure for the growing problem of congestion. With more pupils coming in every year, the school was facing a crisis. In the late 1930s, the famous bell tower, and headmaster's office, were destroyed to make room for a second extension. In 1979, a second building was constructed. In 2005, the Education and Recreation department of Aberdeenshire Council began investigating the consolidation of the school at a single site. In September 2009, the Scottish Government announced that the academy would be one of fourteen secondary schools in Scotland to be rebuilt as part of a ¬£1.25 billion programme. In 2015, the school was relocated to the new purpose built Ellon Academy Community Campus on Kelly Pearl Way to the south of the town. The old building was demolished. Today The school has an estimated 1,068 pupils and a teaching staff of 89 FTE. The school is headed by Rector Pauline Buchan, who succeeded Tim McKay in 2016. Ellon Academy won the Scottish Executive Education Award in 2002 in the category \\"Schools for All\\". Ellon Academy was made a case point during a First Minister's Questions, where it was criticized for its split campus layout and general disrepair. This prompted a visitation from Labour MSPs, and later from STV and BBC television crews. In November 2008, Ellon Academy was awarded the Eco-Schools Green Flag, the organisation's highest award, which accredits schools for their actions helping the environment. In January 2011, Ellon Academy was awarded a second Green Flag. In June 2010, Ellon Academy was shortlisted in the Global Citizenship Award category of the 2010 Scottish Education Awards. On 14 September 2012, Ellon Academy broke the world record for the largest \\"Superman\\" dance. This was part of the recent 80's themed \\"Party In the Park\\" school fundraiser. Ellon academy also holds the world record for the longest sandcastle by Peter Stewart On 10 June 2013, Head Librarian, Jan Murdoch, was named Educational Supporter of the Year 2013 at the Scottish Education Awards in Glasgow.
