(Washington DC.: The Council for Research in Values and Philosophy: 2017, LCCN 2017007504 (print) LCCN 2016053235 (ebook) LC record available at https://lccn.loc.gov/2017007504) It addresses the issue of the relation of the sacred to the secular: Indeed, the questions often asked are whether Huntington s, Clash of Civilizations is today s reality? Is clash and conflict inevitable? This volume collects papers from scholars from all around the globe and digs into that question. Do the sacred and the secular necessarily end in conflict? Building on scholars such as Charles Taylor, Hans-Georg Gadamer, Jurgen Habermaus, and John Rawls, as well as the world s great religious traditions, the authors assembled here respond with a nuanced, but resounding, NO. A deeper read demands the possibility, indeed, necessity, of complementarity. It has become ever more urgent to discover the proper and complementary relation between the two so that both can be promoted through mutual collaboration. The deeper implications of the discussion can be perceived in many current global problems: cultural identity, multiculturalism, pluralism, nationalism, economic inequality, race, terrorism, migration, public education, and climate change. The volume unfolds in seven sections: Foundations; Sacred and Secular; Complement or Conflict; Hermeneutics; African traditions; South Asian Traditions; Chinese Traditions; and Islamic Traditions. It is fascinating to observe how the various authors grapple with unfolding the relation of sacred/secular, faith/reason, church-mosque/state, transcendence/imminence. The section on Islam illustrates this. These chapters deal with the thorny, usually misunderstood debate between the scholars and those, westerners refer to as fundamentalists or radicals. In the latter, there is no space left to reason, interpretation, or historical criticism. This ugly divide usually emerges in the hot-button issues like the treatment of women and religion- related terrorism. However, these oversimplifications betray the intellectual roots of Islamic tradition. Here the argument is advanced that there are common and multiple meanings of rationality in the Islamic primary sources and that doctrine, the Quran, and the Sunnah, open considerable space for the rational and the secular in Islamic teachings. Unknown to most in the West, the grappling within Islam goes on. Moreover, the grappling seems to be heating up in all traditions. We are all called to the discussion. Our globe needs it! Here is the introduction . *From Rumi to Nietzsche (Qom: Sulok-e Javan: 1386/2007 Solar Hejri, ): A collection of comparative articles seeking to dialogue between among tradition, modernity and postmodernity by selecting human subjects such as life, human rights, intuition, religion, rationality and freedom. Mawlana and Suhravardi are selected from traditional world and Kant from modern world and Nietzsche and Heidegger from postmodern world. These articles presented before in international conferences, and because of the new reading from the above-said philosophers, they were very welcomed (pleasant). LC record available at Az MawlƒÅnƒÅ tƒÅ Nƒ´chah *The Philosophical discourse between Islam and the West (Qom: Al-Mustafa International University, 1387/2008, ): This book has a comparative approach in the subjects of being, time, causality, the arguments for the existence of God, the meaning of religious language between transcendental wisdom and some of western well- known philosophers such as Heidegger, Bergson, Hume, Kant and linguistic analysis philosophers. LC record available at LC Catalog - Item Information (Full Record) *The Tradition of Enlightenment in the West and Islam (Tehran: Amir Kabir, 1389/2009, ): This book make a comparison between the Islamic peripatetic philosophy and the enlightenment philosophy of the eighteenth century, in detail. That means it is seeking to present a philosophical reading from the western modernity and enlightened intellectual reading from the Islamic philosophy. In the fact, this book criticizes two dominated thinking on the Islamic world: this fact that the outrace of Islamic philosophy is transcendent wisdom and the matter that Islamic philosophy is not but Islamic theology and accordingly philosophy. Also, it has a positivistic look at the enlightenment philosophy and its latent redeemer matters.

First article is about differences and similarities among literature, philosophy and criticism. The second one compare and study three important thinking personality (Abu Zaid Balkhi, Abu Al-Qasim Balkhi, Abu Al- Mansor Maturidi ) who has been effective in Afghanistan and discuss them from the point of view of their utility for this country. Its two last Article study the notions of Al-Afghani and criticize him while they are mentioning important and helpful points of his ideas. Other articles take a comparative look at the opinions of Al-Farabi, Avicenna, Averroes, Abu Hamid Al-Ghazzali, Mawlana with Machiavelli, intellectuals and Jean-Jacques Rousseau. This book discusses very new ideas such as earthen look at Al-Farabi's policy, or Ibn Roshd's idea of progress which is really controversial by itself among scholars. Above-said books try to institutionalize dialogue among cultures, modern and pre-modern world, Islam and west and also open a way to a kind of inward looking and domestic development.

The original was damaged in a flood whilst on loan to the Tate Gallery in 1928, and was returned to public view for the first time in 50 years after it was restored in 2009. Background The dog in the painting is meant to be \\"Bob\\", a dog that was found in a shipwreck off the coast of England. The dog found his way to the London waterfront where he became known for saving people from drowning, a total of twenty‚Äìthree times over the course of fourteen years. For this, he was made a distinguished member of the Royal Humane Society, granting him a medal and access to food. The painting was bequeathed to the Tate Collection by Newman Smith in 1887. The painting was damaged in a flood at the London Tate Gallery in 1928,http://www2.tate.org.uk/archivejourneys/historyhtml/flood.htm which required extensive restoration work. Following the restoration work which was coordinated by Ron Pemberton, the painting went on display at the Philadelphia Museum of Art from 2002 to 2005. The painting went on loan to The Kennel Club in 2009 in order to form part of the Pets & Prizewinners exhibition at the Kennel Club Art Gallery in London. Prior to this display, it had been unseen in the UK for over fifty years. The coloration of the breed as featured in the painting has become known as a \\"Landseer\\". A 19th century copy of the painting by George Cole was sold by auctioneers Bonhams for ¬£7,200 in March 2007. Aesthetics The dog is painted against a threatening dull sky, in order to highlight the dog himself with the darkened markings on his head standing out. The dog reclines on a quayside, while water ripples against the sea-wall. The shadow of the dog is cast on his own flank. The painting was described by The Art Journal as being \\"one of the best and most interesting publications of the year\\", and \\"Mr Thomas Landseer's first great effort in this department of the art\\".

Jan Dukes De Grey - Mice and Rats in the Loft. Pitchfork. 23 March 2005. History The origins of Jan Dukes de Grey can be traced to the 11-man early-to-mid-60s soul group, \\"Buster Summers Express\\". While performing as a member of Buster Summers, multi-instrumentalist and vocalist Derek Noy began to write his own music and to incorporate his material into Buster Summers' pieces. Receiving positive support for these innovations, and anxious to perform his own material exclusively, Noy split from the group in 1968 to pursue his own musical direction based more extensively on the emerging underground sound of the day (characterized by bands like Cream, Pink Floyd, and Jethro Tull). Noy, penning 50 to 60 titles within the next 6 months, was approached by guitarist/fipple-flautist Michael Bairstow who wished to join Buster Summers Express. Noy explained that he was interested in starting a new band instead, and Bairstow soon agreed. Formed in Leeds in December 1968, the original incarnation of the band consisted of the duo Derek Noy and Michael Bairstow. The name \\"Jan Dukes de Grey\\" was developed by Noy as an exotic-sounding title with no further significance. Gigging and refining Noy's original compositions for the next several months at local venues, Jan Dukes de Grey was signed in 1969 by Decca Records. By October 1969, the 18-track Sorcerers was recorded. The album consisted entirely of original pieces by Noy that have been described by reviewers as naive and instinctive with good musicality but lacking in technique especially in the flute accompaniment.Flautist Bairstow had only learned to play the traditional flute a few months earlier.Rizzi, Cesare. Progressive. Giunti Editore. 1999. p.90. Rizzi, Cesare. Progressive & Underground. Giunti Editore. 2003. p.132. In October 1969, just after Sorcerers had been recorded, former Buster Summers drummer Denis Conlan joined the band and a new brace of gigging began. Though all pieces performed were written by Noy, the band's sound changed considerably during this period to become more strongly progressive and improvisational. This new sound resonated favorably with the university circuit and soon they had achieved a small measure of success, opening for big-name bands like Pink Floyd in November 1969Povey, Glenn & Russell, Ian. In the Flesh: The Complete Performance History. Macmillan, 1998. p.77. Povey, Glenn. Echoes: The Complete History of Pink Floyd. Mind Head Publishing. 2007. p.115. and The Who in May 1970.Neill, Andrew, et al. Anyway, Anyhow, Anywhere: The Complete Chronicle of the Who 1958-1978. Sterling Publishing Company. 2009. p.182. Despite this encouragement, sales of Sorcerers (released in January 1970) were mediocre and the band was forced to sign with the better-distributed Transatlantic Records for their next album, the epic 3-track Mice and Rats in the Loft (released in June 1971). Markedly different from their debut album, the second Jan Dukes de Grey album has been described as less-fragmented and more extreme than Sorcerers. The much longer track-lengths provided the band the opportunity to expand their more improvisational sound and to develop complex progressive themes in a wild and manic manner often favorably compared to Comus' First Utterance Sales of Mice and Rats in the Loft were again tepid and the recording costs advanced by Transatlantic meant that savings had to be made in advertising and the album received little press. Jan Dukes de Grey carried on performing local shows for the next several years, briefly adding former Buster Summers keyboard- and saxophone-player Eddy Spence in late 1970. Bairstow left the band in early 1973 to be replaced by guitarist Patrick Dean, a fan who had written glowing reviews of the band for the Yorkshire Evening Post. By the end of 1973, Conlon also left the band and was replaced by Noy's wife Fiona Dellar. Two other musicians, bassist Danny Lagger and drummer Maurice McElroy joined immediately after Dellar. By April 1974, the band changed its name to \\"Noy's Band\\" and added bass guitarist Alan Ronds to be signed to the Dawn label. As Noy's Band the group released only one single, a reinterpretation of \\"Love Potion Number 9\\" paired with Noy's original piece \\"Eldorado\\". When this release flopped the band began to unravel, finally disbanding in August 1975. Noy, Dellar, and McElroy then joined with musician Nick Griffiths to perform briefly as punk band, Rip Snorter, through 1976 and the start of 1977. In the meanwhile, starting in late 1975, Noy had renewed acquaintance with Pink Floyd and had begun discussing the possibility of a solo-project on the side. This new incarnation of Jan Dukes de Grey would consist primarily of Noy, with Dellar, McElroy, and the newly added keyboardist Peter Lemer providing backup. Additional guests including former Jan Dukes de Grey members as well as a slew of other musicians and personalities would also contribute to songs in an ad hoc manner. At the time, Pink Floyd drummer Nick Mason was heavily involved with Britannia Row Studios and Noy was offered a production deal in 1976 for a new Jan Dukes de Grey album to be recorded at Britannia Row. The third Jan Dukes de Grey album, Strange Terrain took just over a year to complete and cost nearly ¬£100,000 to make. Guest performers on various tracks included Ray Cooper, actor Michael Gothard (playing saxophone), and actress Lydia Lisle, among others. The album was never released and the band dissolved for good shortly afterward. The third and final album at last saw a release in 2010 under the Cherrytree label. Influences The most apparent early influence on Jan Dukes de Grey was the British soul group, \\"Buster Summers Express\\" of which 3 one-time members of the band were members and that founding member Bairstow had originally intended to join. The Jan Dukes de Grey sound diverged from Buster Summers considerably, however, beginning with the influences of Cream, Pink Floyd, and Jethro Tull. Bairstow's use of the flute drew directly from Noy's interest in Donovan, and in creating their debut album Sorcerers the band drew inspiration from such bands as T. Rex and The Incredible String Band. Later in the lifespan of Jan Dukes de Grey, a heavier and more progressive sound was adopted such that Strange Terrain was described as demonstrating influence from Arthur Brown, David Bowie, and mid-70s Pink Floyd.

It is a left tributary of the Kocher. Its source is near Kaisersbach. It passes through Welzheim, T√§ferrot, Leinzell and Heuchlingen, and flows into the Kocher in Abtsgm√ºnd.  Geography  = History = From its source at Kaisersbach‚ÄìEulenhof, the river Lein flows quite steadily to the south and in the east past Welzheim. At Alfdorf‚ÄìHaghof its course bends off to the east and maintains this direction with slight fluctuations until Heuchlingen, from where it reaches Abtsgm√ºnd and the Kocher in northeastern direction. Its catchment area is mainly on its left side, because in its southern upper valley it has a strong competitor on the right side in the nearby Wieslauf and its tributaries with a clearly deeper erosion base, in the eastern middle course to Heuchlingen the Rems tributaries dig the water out of it so much that the watershed follows the Lein itself closely in the south, often only a few hundred meters away from the river itself. Only in the northeast-oriented lower course from Heuchlingen it has any noteworthy right tributaries at all, here it shares the ridge around Dewangen with the Kocher in about equal parts. Its tributary system has roughly the shape of a ridge: In the south and west the Lein itself is situated, from the north the larger tributaries are parallel to it. = Tributaries = From the source to the estuary: * Spatzenbach (right), 1.6 km and 1.8 km¬≤ * Seewiesengraben (right), 0.8 km * Hofwiesengraben (right), 0,6 km * R√∂telbach (right), 1,1 km * Pfaffenader (right), 0,5 km * G√∂ckelesbad (right), 0,6 km * Ropbach (right), 1,3 km and 1,3 km * Haschbach (left), 1.3 km and 1.3 km¬≤ * Eisenbach (left), 5,4 km and 7,6 km¬≤ * Mettelbach (left), 1.8 km * Renisbach (right), 1,1 km * Gellbach (left), 2.7 km * Rot (left), 11.1 km and 34.9 km¬≤ * Upper Gellbach (left), 3.8 km * Spitzerbach (right), 1,8 km * Schmiedbach (left), 1,1 km * Krummbach (left), 2.7 km * Reichenbach (left), 7.0 km and 9.6 km¬≤ * Aitelbach (right), 1.9 km and 1.4 km¬≤ * Spraitbach (left), 3.4 km and 3.3 km¬≤ * Zimmerbach ('left'), 1.3 km * Mountain stream (left), 0,9 km * Durlang stream (left), 1,3 km and 2,3 km¬≤ * Source of energy (right), 0,5 km * Rot , also Gwenty red (left), 17,8 km and 49,0 km¬≤ * Sulzbach ('left'), 3.3 km * Hellenbach (right), 0,5 km * (Leinzeller) Laubach (left), 3.0 km * G√∂tzenbach (left), 8.2 km and 18.1 km¬≤ * G√∂gginger Bach (left), 1,0 km * Brainkofener Bach (right), 1,2 km * Ziegelbach (right), 0,7 km * Krebsbach (left), 1,2 km * Lohbach (right), 1,9 km * Haftenbach (left), 0,7 km * Federbach (left), 5,8 km and 10,2 km¬≤ * Sch√∂nhardter Bach (right) 0,7 km * Hackbankbach (right), 2,0 km and 1,8 km¬≤ * Auchtbach (left), 0.5 km * Aspesbach (right), 0,6 km * Tiefenbach (right), 2.4 km * K√ºferbach (right), 2.7 km and 2.4 km¬≤ * Siechenbach, in the upper course 'M√ºhlbach (left), 2,9 km and 2,9 km¬≤ * Schafwaldbach ('right'), 0,5 km * Burgwiesbach (left), 1,0 km *(\\"Reichenbacher\\") Laubach (right), 5,5 km and 6,7 km¬≤ * Blumenwaldbach (left), 0.9 km * Kauwiesenbach (right), 0,4 km * Spatzenbach (left), 4.8 km and 8.1 km¬≤ * Stapfelbach (right), 3.9 km and 3.0 km¬≤ * Kotholzbach (left), 1.6 km * Weiherbach (left), 1,0 km * (Dewanger) Haldenbach (right), 3.8 km and 3.5 km¬≤ * Attleswasenbach (right), 1,4 km * Laubbach (right), 4,8 km and 2,9 km¬≤  Hydrology  = Hydrological main line = Hydrologically, the Lein can be considered the main source of the Kocher system, as it is more than twice as long at the mouth of the river as this one (57 km vs. 25 km), whose name overflow also exceeds in the catchment area (250 km¬≤ vs. 152 km¬≤) and also carries slightly more water than this one - despite its strong karst springs, which additionally feed from areas beyond its superficial watersheds. = direction of flow = The direction of flow of the Lein is striking; it consistently moves away from the Neckar, into which its water finally reaches via the Kocher, and its valley meets the Kocher in Abtsgm√ºnd, almost in the opposite direction to that of the Kocher, which flows there in a west- northwest direction towards the Neckar. The reason for this is that the course of the river Lein was laid out at a time when the area was still draining to the southeast towards the Danube and the Black Sea . The same is true for the neighbouring rivers \\"Spiegelberger\\" Lauter, Bibers, \\"Fichtenberger\\" Rot and the Blinde Rot, which flows into the Kocher from the other side just below Abtsgm√ºnd in almost opposite directions. Today's outflow over the Kocher, the Neckar and the Rhine towards the North Sea was only created when the Upper Rhine Plain began to sink from the Eocene onwards and as a result the depth erosion in the surrounding river system of the Rhine increased. Through numerous stream captures of Danube tributaries the European main watershed shifted gradually to the southeast in favour of the Rhine. = Flood protection and retention basin = Nowadays the Lein and its northern tributaries feed numerous smaller reservoirs, many of which were built for flood protection and which also serve as bathing lakes (e.g. the Aichstrut reservoir) for local recreation. Others are old mill lakes, because at Lein as well as at the bigger tributaries many water mills were running in former times. After recurring floods along the Lein, one of them in March 1956 finally gave the impetus for the founding of the \\"Wasserverband Kocher-Lein\\" (Kocher-Lein Water Association) by the neighbouring communities in 1957. For flood protection, the new association built eleven storage and retention basins between 1957 and 1982, which it still operates today. Five of these are located in the Rems-Murr district, six in the Ostalbkreis. They are constantly dammed to form small lakes. Most of them are developed for local recreation, some are designated as bathing lakes. The eleven artificial lakes together can hold back up to 14 million m¬≥, they lie between 390 m above sea level and 500 m above sea level and their total catchment area covers about 250 km¬≤. Between 1990 and 2000, 28.5 million euros were spent on a rehabilitation programme, partly on remote data transmission and remote control equipment, so that since 1997 all eleven basins have been centrally controlled and monitored. , accessed on 16 March 2009.Ostalbkreis.de - press release: 386 of 20 December 2004; Flood protection in the Ostalbkreis reorganised - district administrator and association head sign contracts for technical support, accessed on 16 March 2009.

He was born in the Aisin Gioro clan, the imperial clan of the Qing dynasty, as the third son of Abatai. Life Bolo was conferred the title of a beizi (fourth-rank prince) in 1636 and took part in the campaigns against the Mongols, Chinese, and Koreans. In 1644, Bolo followed Dorgon to Beijing. He accompanied Dodo in pursuit of Li Zicheng, and was promoted to the status of a beile (third-rank prince) for his achievement. In 1645, he followed Dodo to Nanjing where he was given command of half the army to pacify nearby cities. He succeeded in taking Changzhou, Suzhou, and Hangzhou, but returned to Beijing late the same year. In 1646, he was again sent to Zhejiang, this time as commander-in-chief of the Qing troops with the title \\"Great General Who Pacifies the South\\" (Âπ≥ÂçóÂ§ßÂ∞áËªç). His aim was to conquer Zhejiang and Fujian and this he accomplished in 1646. From Fujian he sent a detachment south, which took Guangzhou from remaining Southern Ming forces early in 1647. On his triumphal return to Beijing, Bolo was promoted to a junwang (second-rank prince) and given the title \\"Prince Duanzhong of the Second Rank\\". In 1648, he and Ajige were commissioned to inquire into the situation in Mongolia, however a rebellion broke out simultaneously in Datong, Shanxi, and both laid siege to the city to quell the rebellion. When Dorgon personally conducted the siege of Datong in 1649 he promoted Bolo to the status of a qinwang (first-rank prince), and placed him in command of an expedition to suppress another uprising in Shanxi. After those who were rebelling were subdued late in 1649, Bolo returned to Beijing. The following year he was entrusted with the supervision of the Six Boards of the central government but was soon demoted to the status of a junwang for failing to inform against the president of a Board, who had disobeyed orders. Early in 1651, he was reinstated as a qinwang. He and the princes Nikan and Mandahai were trusted by Dorgon and were left in power after the latter died. Before long, however, Bolo aligned himself with the princes who had opposed Dorgon. Later he was once more demoted to junwang, this time for failure to report that Ajige, then in prison, was in possession of weapons. Eventually, his rank of a qinwang was restored to him. After Dorgon's death in 1650, Bolo married one of his consorts, the Korean princess Yi Ae-suk.Veritable Records of Hyeongjong, volume 5, day 18, month 5, year 3 of Hyeongjong's reign. After his death in 1652, he was granted the posthumous name Ding (ÂÆö), and his title was passed on to one of his sons. But when it was disclosed that Bolo while living had appropriated for his own use property which had belonged to Dorgon, he was posthumously deprived of all honours, and his descendants were also deprived of their ranks in 1659. A small work written in 1673, entitled Guoxu Zhi (ÈÅéÂ¢üÂøó), tells the story of a Manchu prince who engaged in the conquest of south China, and married a Chinese widow surnamed Liu (Âäâ). This work did not disclosed the name of the prince in question, but according to internal evidence, some historians believe Bolo is the prince described in the work.

The station was opened in 1846 by the North British Railway. It replaced an earlier Portobello station nearby on the Edinburgh and Dalkeith Railway. History A 1905 Railway Clearing House diagram of Edinburgh railways, with the SSJR (in blue along the bottom) The station was rebuilt in 1887. During its lifetime, as rail services evolved, Portobello was served by most passenger trains running out of the east end of Waverley including stopping trains on the Berwick and Carlisle main lines and through trains to the various branches, e.g. Musselburgh, North Berwick, Gifford, Glencorse, Penicuik, Polton, Dalkeith, but excepting express and semi-fast long distance trains and a few limited stop residential trains (as they were then known), for example some North Berwick and Dunbar trains. There was a service to South Leith from a separate platform. Following the opening of in 1903, to which Edinburgh south suburban circle trains via Portobello ran, the South Leith service was rapidly run down and then withdrawn in 1905. Although the station was accessible from residential areas in several directions, and not much more than 300 metres away from more densely populated High Street area, tram and bus services from the High Street to a range of destinations across the city centre abstracted traffic from the rail service. Until the end of operation some of those commuters for whom the service was convenient continued to travel home for lunch, a benefit from their season ticket purchase but of no financial benefit to the railway. Closure Portobello was not included in the list of stations proposed for closure in the \\"Reshaping of British Railways\\" report of March 1963 but was added later (as some other services and stations were), closing 7 September 1964. In the final two years of its existence services were provided mainly by trains to , Musselburgh and . Portobello Station closed on and from Monday 7 September 1964 (when the Edinburgh-Musselburgh rail service was withdrawn with the closure also of , , and stations). Future A local campaigning group, the Capital Rail Action Group (CRAG), is running a campaign for Portobello Station to be re-opened to passenger services, as the station lies on the line served by Edinburgh Crossrail between Edinburgh Waverley and Brunstane. Journey times to Waverley have been estimated at 5 minutes, in contrast to the half-hour journey by bus. CRAG is also campaigning for the ESSJR south suburban railway which loops around Edinburgh's Southside back to Haymarket. The group proposes that it should be operated either as a commuter rail service or as a light rail system to form an extension of the Edinburgh Tram Network. Following a petition submitted to the Scottish Parliament in 2007, the proposal was rejected in 2009 by transport planners due to anticipated cost.

The siege was part of the Seventh Ottoman‚ÄìVenetian War, and, coming in the aftermath of the lightning conquest of the Morea by the Ottoman forces in the previous year, was a major success for Venice, representing its last major military success and allowing it to preserve its rule over the Ionian Islands.  Background  Following the Ottoman Empire's defeat in the Second Siege of Vienna in 1683, the Holy League of Linz gathered most European states (except for France, England and the Netherlands) in a common front against the Ottomans. In the resulting Great Turkish War (1684‚Äì1699) the Ottoman Empire suffered a number of defeats such as the battles of Moh√°cs and Zenta, and in the Treaty of Karlowitz (1699), was forced to cede the bulk of Hungary to the Habsburg Monarchy, Podolia to Poland- Lithuania, while Azov was taken by the Russian Empire. Further south, the Republic of Venice had launched its own attack on the Ottoman Empire, seeking revenge for successive conquests of its overseas empire by the Turks, most recently (1669) the loss of Crete. During the conflict, Venetian troops seized the island of Cephalonia (Santa Maura) and the Morea peninsula, although they failed to retake Crete and expand their possessions in the Aegean Sea. The Ottomans were from the outset determined to reverse these losses, beginning a reform of their navy, while Venice found itself increasingly isolated diplomatically from the other European powers: the Holy League had fractured after its victory, and the War of the Spanish Succession (1701‚Äì1714) and the Great Northern War (1700‚Äì1721) preoccupied the attention of most European states. The Ottomans took advantage of the favourable international situation and secured their northern flank by defeating Russia. After the end of the Russo-Turkish war, the emboldened Ottoman leadership turned its focus on Venice, declaring war on 9 December 1714. The opening move of the conflict was the invasion of the Venetian province in the Morea by the Ottoman Grand Vizier, Silahdar Damat Ali Pasha. Aided by Venetian military unpreparedness, the reluctance of its fleet to confront the more powerful Ottoman navy, and the reluctance of the local Greek population to assist the Venetians, the Ottomans quickly captured the entire peninsula in July‚ÄìSeptember 1715. At the same time, the Ottoman fleet, under the Kapudan Pasha Canƒ±m Hoca Mehmed Pasha, seized the Venetian-held islands of Tinos and Aigina: their Venetian governors surrendered without offering any resistance. The Ottomans immediately shifted their attention towards the western coasts of the Greek mainland, threatening the Venetian Ionian Islands and the Republic's possessions in Dalmatia. The approach of the Ottoman fleet under the Kapudan Pasha forced the Venetian Captain General of the Sea, , to stay at Lefkada (Santa Maura) to protect the vulnerable island, located close to the mainland. However, this meant the loss of the southernmost of the Ionian Islands, Kythira (Cerigo): left without hopes of relief, it surrendered to the Kapudan Pasha in September. Shortly after, the Ottomans forced the capitulation of the last remaining Venetian island strongholds off Crete, Souda and Spinalonga. Dolfin tried to react by leading a foray into the Aegean, but unable to encounter the Ottoman fleet, he returned into the Ionian Sea. Disheartened, he abandoned Lefkada after destroying its fortifications and withdrew to Corfu. Lefkada was almost immediately captured by the Ottomans. Venetian preparations and initial Ottoman moves View of Corfu and its fortifications, with the Venetian fleet, The Venetians were well aware of Ottoman ambitions to capture the Ionian Islands, which dated to the before the Great Turkish War. By 1716, it was clear that Corfu would be the next target. Preparing for the inevitable confrontation, the Venetian Senate replaced Dolfin, seen as too timid and ineffective, with Andrea Pisani, already in Corfu as Provveditore Generale da Mar. In early 1716, Pisani disposed of 18 galleys, two galleasses and 12 galleots, 26 ships of the line, and two fireships. In February, the Saxon field marshal, Count Johann Matthias von der Schulenburg arrived on the island as commander-in-chief of the Venetian forces. The fortifications of Corfu city, situated on a promontory in the middle of the islands eastern shore, had been neglected during the previous decades, as the extraordinary effort during the Morean War had left the Venetian treasury empty. Schulenburg set about strengthening the fortifications with palisades, trenches, and field works. The threat of an imminent Ottoman invasion led many of the inhabitants of the Ionian Islands to flee, some to Dalmatia, and others to Italy and Sicily. At the same time, the Republic of Venice struggled to provide the funds and men required. On the outbreak of the conflict, the Venetians had called for aid from the other European states, but apart from the Crusading orders of the Knights Hospitaller and the Knights of St. Stephen, the major European powers responded only after the loss of the Morea. Some help began to arrive in spring 1716, as Portugal and Spain responded to Papal calls for a crusade by offering parts of their fleets for operations against the Ottomans. More importantly, the Austrians decided to enter the war against the Ottomans. In April, Prince Eugene of Savoy sent an ultimatum to cease hostilities and restore to Venice the territories accorded to her by the Treaty of Karlowitz, but the Ottomans rejected it and declared war in June. In May, the Austrians warned Schulenburg that strong Ottoman forces under the serasker Merzifonlu Kara Mustafa Pasha‚Äîgovernor of Diyarbekir Eyalet and nephew of the namesake Grand Vizier who led the Siege of Vienna in 1683‚Äîwere assembling on the mainland coast across the island. At the same time, the Ottoman fleet under Canƒ±m Hoca Mehmed Pasha exited the Dardanelles into the Aegean. While keeping his rowed warships in Corfu, Pisani sent his more manoeuverable ships of the line ahead, under the Capitano Straordinario delle Navi Andrea Corner, to observe the straits between the Morea and Crete for the Ottomans' approach. Corner slowly retreated in face of the much larger Ottoman fleet until Zakynthos (Zante). On 22 June, Pisani sent Corner to intercept the Ottoman fleet, but the Ottomans chose to bypass the straits between the Ionian Islands and the mainland and sail out into the open sea, rounding on Corfu from the northwest. Corner was left trying to catch up with the Ottomans, following them at a few days' distance. Passing by Zakynthos, the Ottoman admiral sent a letter demanding the island's submission, but did not otherwise divert his course. Likewise, only small detachments were landed at Cephalonia for small- scale raids, before the fleet moved on to Corfu, where it arrived on 5 July. The Ottomans anchored in the Corfu Channel, between the northeastern promontory of the island and the mainland, and began preparing for the siege. In the meantime, an Ottoman army of 30,000 infantry and 3,000 cavalry had gathered on the mainland shore at Butrint, ready to be ferried across the Corfu Channel by the fleet. Along with the fleet, the Ottomans were said to field no less than 2,000 cannon for the siege. The news spread panic on the island: the villagers fled into the fortifications of Corfu city, while others tried to flee, on whatever vessel they could find, to Otranto. Soon the panic spread to the suburbs of the city itself, with their inhabitants also abandoning their homes to find refuge inside the fortifications. The situation became worse when Pisani, having to confront the far superior Ottoman fleet of 62 ships of the line with only his rowed vessels, decided not to risk a battle. After considering disembarking his crews to reinforce the garrison, he resolved to abandon his station in the Corfu Channel for the open sea, hoping to find Corner's squadron, which he had not heard from for 20 days. Rumours spread that the fleet had abandoned the island to its fate, leading to the outbreak of looting of the empty houses, as well as cases of arson, and even killings as the looters clashed. Schulenburg, with the assistance of the Provveditore Generale da Mar, Antonio Loredan, tried to impose order while mustering his forces for the defence of the city: on 6 July, the Venetian commander disposed of about 1,000 German mercenaries, 400 Italian and Dalmatian soldiers, 500 Corfiots, and 300 Greeks from other regions. The arrival of some 500 soldiers, under the Zakynthian captains Frangiskos Romas and the brothers Nikolaos and Frangiskos Kapsokefalos, represented a significant boost to Schulenburg's forces, but the situation remained problematic due to the low morale of the civilian population. Ottoman landings and siege of Corfu The Ottoman siege of the city began on 8 July, with landings of some 4,000 Janissaries and 6,000 other troops at Ypsos. On the evening of the same day, however, Corner's squadron arrived unexpectedly and attacked the Ottoman fleet, despite having only 27 ships to the Ottomans' 62. The ensuing naval battle was indecisive, but the sudden Venetian attack forced the Ottoman ships to cut their anchors and temporarily abandon their anchorage and interrupt their ferrying of the Ottoman troops. This bold action demonstrated the Venetians' determination to defend Corfu, and also raised hopes about the island's ability to resist the Ottomans; for a time, it seemed even possible that the Venetian fleet might hinder the passage of fresh Ottoman troops, and allow those already present on the island to be cut off. As a result, the mood of the population swung into enthusiastic support for the defence, and many hundreds volunteered to assist in building fortifications, man artillery pieces, or enlisted in militias. On 10 July, the Ottoman ships recommenced landing troops, a process which continued without the Venetians making any attempt to interrupt it. Clashes with the Canƒ±m Hoca Mehmed's men on the island continued over the next few days, as reinforcements started arriving for the defenders and the Ottomans alike: on 18 July Pisani returned to the island with a new, eighty-gun warship, two transports with 1,500 men, and a ship with food, while shortly after the troops of the serasker also began landing on the island. The Ottoman forces were able to expand their occupation in the interior, pressing the inhabitants of the villages they captured into erecting field works. On 21 July, the Ottomans reached the suburbs of Mantouki and Gastrades. Sketch of the confrontation of the Ottoman (left) and Venetian (right) fleets in the Corfu Channel during the siege On the next day, the first ships of Venice's Christian allies appeared of Cape Lefkimmi in the south: nine ships of the Knights of Malta, the vanguard of a much larger Christian fleet composed of ships from the Papal States, the Republic of Genoa, Spain, and the Grand Duchy of Tuscany. On 31 July, four Papal, two Genoese, three Tuscan and five Spanish galleys arrived, along with four ships of the line hired by the Pope. Their arrival helped to prevent the Ottoman fleet from attacking the fortress from the northeast, and kept the sea open for supplies to reach Corfu city. At the same time, the Ottoman forces on the island were making progress, capturing the fort of the Saviour (San Salvatore) and the hill of Abramios (Monte Abramo) to the west of the city. On 5 August, the serasker issued a demand for the Venetians' surrender, threatening to massacre the garrison and flatten the city otherwise. Schulenburg rejected the demand, but the defenders were in dire straits, as they had suffered heavy losses and much of their artillery had been destroyed. On the same day, the Venetian fleet moved to engage the Ottomans, but at the last moment, the wind shifted, giving the Ottomans the advantage, forcing the Venetians to break off. Schulemburg proposed a sortie of the garrison for 6 July, but Pisani refused to co-operate and the project was shelved. On 8 August, the situation began to change in favour of the defenders, as 1,500 troops with ample supplies and ammunition arrived to bolster the garrison, bringing with them news of the Austrian victory at the Battle of Petrovaradin on 5 August. As a result, on the night of 18/19 August, the Venetians sortied against the Ottoman lines supported by fire from the galleys on both sides of the city. As the German contingent failed in its objectives, and the sortie was pushed back. In turn, on the morning of 19 August, the Janissaries launched a mass assault on the fortifications, overrunning the bastion of St. Athanasios and part of the outer fortified belt and reaching the Skarpon Gate, where they hosted their banners. Schulenburg led a counterattack in person, and managed to push the Ottomans back. On the next day, a storm broke out that wrought havoc with both fleets; some of the Christian ships unmoored by the winds and thrown towards the shore, while the Ottoman fleet suffered somewhat heavier losses. Undeterred, the Ottomans reorganized their forces on 20 August to resume their assault on the fortification, but on the next day, a Spanish squadron of six ships of the line appeared on the horizon. During the night, the defenders could see much activity in the Ottoman lines, and fully expected to face another general assault on the next day; instead, come morning they found the Ottoman lines deserted. The Ottomans had abandoned the siege and began boarding their ships, in such haste that they left behind many supplies and equipment, including some of the heaviest siege guns. This presented an ideal opportunity for a Venetian attack, but Pisani refused to do so, contenting himself withdrawing his ships up in a line to block the southern exit of the Channel. When he did try to attack on the 23rd, contrary wind prevented him from coming close to the Ottoman fleet, and on the 24th he returned to passively keeping watch over the southern exit of the Channel. Pisani's reluctance to engage may be explained by past experience, which had shown that the management of the Venetians' Christian allies in battle was a difficult matter. This allowed Canƒ±m Hoca Mehmed Pasha to move his fleet north to Butrint, and thence exit the Channel from the north and then sail south along the western coast of Greece and return to the safety of the Dardanelles. Pisani's fleet followed the Ottomans at a distance, while most of the other Christian ships, apart from the Knights of Malta, left in early September, once it became clear that the Ottomans were gone. The reason for the Ottoman withdrawal is still debated: some consider the arrival of the Spanish squadron, and news of the imminent arrival of a Portuguese squadron of nine ships, to have been decisive; other accounts tell of a mutiny in the besieging army; but the most likely reason is that, in the aftermath of the losses suffered at Petrovaradin, the serasker received urgent orders to wrap up operations so that his men could replenish the Ottoman forces in the northern Balkans. The Ottomans lost some 15,000 dead in Corfu, along with 56 cannons and 8 siege mortars, and large quantities of materiel, which they abandoned. The total losses, civilian and military, on the defenders' side, were 30,000. Aftermath Statue erected to Schulenburg in front of the Old Fortress, Corfu The Corfiots attributed the Ottoman withdrawal to the intervention of their patron saint, Saint Spyridon, and the \\"miraculous\\" storm, while Venice celebrated the last major battlefield success in its history, heaping honours on Schulenburg similar to those enjoyed by Francesco Morosini after his conquest of the Morea a generation earlier. He received a lifelong stipend of 5,000 ducats and a sword of honour, as well as a monument erected in his honour in front of the gateway to the Old Fortress in Corfu. The defence of Corfu was also commemorated in Venice with the erection of a fourth stone lion at the entrance of the Venetian Arsenal, with the inscription \\"anno Corcyrae liberatae\\". As the Ottoman troops withdrew into the Balkan hinterland, Schulenburg and Loredan led 2,000 men to the mainland coast, and on 2 September recaptured the town of Butrint, one of the mainland exclaves of the Ionian Islands. Two months later, the Venetian fleet recaptured Lefkada. The arrival of naval reinforcements allowed the Venetian navy to engage the Ottoman fleet with more confidence. Christian victories in the Battle of Imbros (16 June 1717) and the Battle of Matapan (19 July 1717) removed the danger of a new Ottoman expedition in the Ionian Sea, and allowed the recovery of the two last mainland exclaves, Preveza and Vonitsa, on 19 October 1717 and 4 November 1717 respectively. Despite the successes, Venice was exhausted. The Austrians, buoyed by their victories, were unwilling to discuss terms, until the Spanish launched an attack on the Habsburg possessions in Italy by sending the very fleet ostensibly being prepared to aid Venice to capture Sardinia in July 1717, and another to invade Sicily a year later. Faced with this stab in the back, the Austrians agreed to negotiations with the Ottomans, leading to the Treaty of Passarowitz (21 July 1718), in which Austria made considerable gains. Venice had to acknowledge the loss of the Morea, Tinos, and Aigina, but managed to retain the Ionian Islands and their mainland exclaves.

All of these knots are rectangular and lie in a plane. They are named after plait-woven baskets, which have a similar appearance. Construction A diagram of a long basket weave knot on a 2√ó5 grid A basket weave knot is made up of two sets of parallel lines drawn inside a rectangle such that the lines meet at the edges of the rectangle. For a true basket weave knot that can be tied with two strands, the number of intersections in each direction cannot have a common divisor. Within this constraint, there is no theoretical upper limit to the size of a basket weave knot. Thus, a knot that has two intersections in one direction can be lengthened with any odd number in the perpendicular direction. If the dimension n in the smaller direction is odd, it is always possible to construct a knot with n + 2 intersections in the other dimension. However, large basket weave knots have a tendency to twist and curl because they are completely flat. A basket weave knot can be tied from a single strand by first forming a bight in the middle of the line. The ends near the bight become the standing ends. This method will keep the knot in one plane only for knots in which the standing ends enter the same side; these knots are called bosun's knots because they can be tied in a lanyard. For knots in which the standing ends enter from different sides of the rectangle, the bight will wrap across one side of the knot after it is set. Any basket weave knot that can be tied from two strands can be drawn as an endless knot by connecting the standing ends together and the working ends together. An example of this can be seen in the carrick mat. A decorative use on the Gosforth Cross, from the 10th century AD If a basket weave knot is tied with a flat line such as ribbon instead of a round line such as rope or cord, the method of turning the line at the edges affects the final appearance. Deflecting the line will form a series of bights or scallops along the edge, while folding it over will leave the edge flat.Ashley, pp. 148-149 Examples A carrick bend knot with a 2√ó3 rectangular grid superimposed upon it The simplest basket weave knots consist of a two‚Äìby‚Äìthree rectangle of intersections and include the following: *Carrick bend *Double coin knot *Sheet bend *Reef knot *Granny knot In the reef knot and granny knot, the standing ends enter the short side, while in the double coin knot and the sheet bend, the standing ends enter the long side. Therefore, any of these knots could be used for a lanyard. In the carrick bend, which is otherwise similar to the double coin knot, the standing ends enter opposite long sides. The next smallest possible basket weave knot is made up of a three‚Äìby‚Äìfour rectangle, and may be called a boatswain's lanyard, whistle lanyard, Napoleon knot, or Chinese knot, although the art of Chinese knotting includes many more knots besides this one.

Rating of Military Units in the Russian Federation  In the autumn of 2004 the Mother's Right Foundation issued a rating of the most dangerous military units in Russia in the past 10 years (1994-2004). The rating was based on the analysis of 5,433 questionnaires filled out by parents of dead soldiers, who contacted the Foundation during the period of 1994‚Äì2004. The Article ‚ÄòEyes Toward Death‚Äô (Artyom Davydov. Moskovsky Komsomolets) caused a public outcry.  Actions  In 2010‚Äì2011, the Mother's Right Foundation started a project in the social net Odnoklassniki.ru that was dedicated to the memory of servicemen who died in the army during peacetime. The Foundation's activists set up dead servicemen's accounts to present their profiles in the first person - as if written by the victims. They also displayed the dead servicemen's pictures with mourning ribbons. Thus, their abandoned profiles and data revived on the pages of their friends who learnt about their lives and deaths. The project was performed by a group of volunteers. They asked the servicemen's parents‚Äô permission to use their sons‚Äô personal data. ‚ÄúThe idea of the Odnoklassniki project is simple: the Ministry of Defense was interested in the boys only when they were called up to military service. And now, after their tragic deaths, they are forgotten, as if they never existed. We consider it unfair. They have been and will always be alive to their parents and close relatives. We would like other people to hear their voices. These boys joined the army and fulfilled their military duty and thus, they deserve to be heard by society,‚Äù reported Veronica Marchenko, Board Chair of the Mother's Right Foundation, to Interfax. ‚ÄúThe project is meant to prevent the Ministry of Defense from consigning to oblivion the servicemen‚Äôs names and faces, and turn them into indifferent numbers of the official statistics. Many people will now read the soldiers‚Äô stories. It has nothing to do with the spiritualistic s√©ance. As a rule, parents of dead soldiers were grieving the loss of their sons in isolation,‚Äù tells the head of the foundation. ‚ÄúNobody cared about them. Now, they receive comments from hundreds of people. They receive words of encouragement. For the first time, they feel the sympathy of society.‚Äù ‚ÄúWe really like the foundation‚Äôs idea,‚Äù says Ivan Sergeyevich Dolin, citizen of Tchaikovsky Town, Perm Region, and the father of Anton Dolin who was bullied to death in the Vityaz Special Forces Detachment, Dzerzhinsky Division, Moscow Region. ‚ÄúLet people remember them.‚Äù  Charity  At the end of December 2000, a charitable auction organized by the deputies of the State Duma of the Russian Federation, V. E. Koptev-Dvornikov, V. O. Semyonov and A. Y. Vulf, was held at the Metelitsa Club in Moscow. Altogether, 58 lots belonging to 51 celebrities were sold. The most expensive lot was Alsou's concert dress. Other lots - from most to less expensive - were as follows: Lev Leschenko's hat, Iosif Kobzon's concert costume, Anatoly Karpov's first chess set, Kristina Orbakaite's concert dress, Tatyana Ovsienko's wedding dress, Valery Leontiev's tail-coat, Larisa Dolina's concert dress, and Irina Khakamada's home kimono. The raised funds were transferred into the account of the Mother's Right Foundation (totaling over 500,000 rubles). The funds were evenly distributed among the parents of the soldiers who perished in Chechnya. In 2006, the foundation raised 127,249 rubles in donations to help the mother of Andrey Sychyov who was bullied to death during his military service.,.  Awards  In 2004, Kariera made the first rating of Russian charitable organizations and foundations. The Mother's Right Foundation was awarded the 4th place among 400 nominees. In accordance with the results of the contest organized by the SuperJob.Ru Portal in 2008, the foundation was recognized as the Employer of Choice.  Location  The office of the foundation is located in the Central Administrative District of Moscow in Luchnikov Lane. It has been there since August 1992. Like many public organizations, the foundation had to fight to have their office in a convenient and accessible location.

He set up his practice in Boston, Massachusetts, where he was the first African American to become a member of the Massachusetts Medical Society (or any medical society in the US). Born in New York City, he was of multiracial ancestry: his father was born in Calcutta of Indian-French parentage and educated by his father in France, and his mother's family was African American with more distant Dutch, German and Moroccan ancestors. Grasse supported abolitionism and efforts to resist the Fugitive Slave Act of 1850.

They were descendants through their mother's family of Jan Janszoon of Haarlem, Netherlands, and Margarita, a Moorish woman. That couple had four sons, who were mixed-race: two, Abraham Janszoon van Salee, and his brother Anthony, the better known, emigrated independently to New Netherlands from Amsterdam in the 1630s, settling in what became New York. Each had married European women. Their later generations of descendants, who continued to \\"marry white\\", are said to include \\"the Vanderbilts, the Whitneys, Jacqueline Kennedy Onassis and Humphrey Bogart.\\" Abraham was said to have also had a son in New York by a black mistress, establishing a line that became predominately identified as African American, while also having considerable European ancestry. Maria van Salee had married George de Grasse, who was born in Calcutta as Azar Le Guen; he was of mixed-race, Indian-French ancestry. It is likely that he was the natural son of Fran√ßois Joseph Paul de Grasse, a French naval officer, who was stationed on and off in India from 1762 to 1781. Based on census records, Azar was born about 1780 to an Indian woman. The senior de Grasse is known to have taken Azar as a child with him to Paris for his education and adopted him, naming him George de Grasse. The senior Grasse was long married to a French woman and had a total of five children from his marriage who survived to adulthood. His eldest son, known as Alexandre Auguste de Grasse, his title as Comte de Grasse after the father's death. Francois de Grasse, also known as Comte de Grasse, became an admiral in 1781. He was a naval hero during the American Revolutionary War, where he commanded the French fleet in the Battle of the Chesapeake, defeating the British and contributing to their surrender at Yorktown. He also fought in the Caribbean. After the war, he returned to France, where he died in 1788.

Through his father's connections, Grasse worked for a period for Aaron Burr, who gave him two lots in the Five Points area of Lower Manhattan, making him a landowner as a free man of color. De Grasse became a naturalized citizen of the United States in 1804. With his French-South Asian ancestry, he escaped some of the restrictions against African Americans. He and his wife Maria stressed education for their children, and all three became educated. Theodosia DeGrasse studied at the Canterbury Female Boarding School. John de Grasse received a fine education, studying at the Oneida Institute in upstate New York from the age of 15. Then he went to Paris, where he studied medicine at Aubuk College. He returned to the United States, continuing his studies at the Bowdoin College's Medical School of Maine in Brunswick, where he earned a medical degree with honors in May 1849. He was the first person of color to earn a medical degree at a United States college. He returned to France to study under the noted French surgeon Alfred-Armand-Louis-Marie Velpeau, who published several books on obstetrics, surgery, and various medical techniques. Marriage and family In 1851 Grasse returned to the United States, settling in Boston. The next year on August 5, 1852, he married Cordelia Lucretia Howard of that city. Her parents were Peter and Margaret (Gardner) Howard. His sister Serena married George T. Downing. He became a highly successful restaurateur both in New York City and in Newport, Rhode Island, as well as an activist and abolitionist. Downing used his connections with powerful white families to support abolitionism and try to achieve social change for his people. Career and Civil War DeGrasse set up his practice in Boston in 1854. He joined the Massachusetts Medical Society, the first African American to join any medical society in the United States. When the United States Colored Troops were authorized for the Union Army in 1863, Grasse served as a surgeon with the 54th Massachusetts Regiment, the first unit formed.

He published the work through W. W. Norton & Company in April 2003. Berman asserts that modern Islamist groups such as al Qaeda share fundamental ideological elements with fascism and other 20th-century Western totalitarian movements, and he defends an assertive approach to root out this extremist thinking across the world. He details the appeal of violent terror, going back to Albert Camus' work The Rebel, first published in 1951. Berman hypothesizes that the spread of democracy in the Arab world, while highly difficult and involving a long struggle, is a fundamentally just cause, and he writes in support of the George W. Bush administration's foreign policies while also faulting President Bush for credibility problems and incompetence. The book received a wide variety of reviews. Salon.com ran a review that described the work as \\"an important entry in the debate over the meaning of 9/11 and after\\". Author Sam Harris praised the work in Harris' own book The End of Faith, which also discussed jihadist terrorism. Washington Monthly journalist Joshua Micah Marshall particularly remarked that \\"Berman's book is by turns penetrating, insightful, honest, sloppy, erudite, superficial, hot-blooded, serious, and florid.\\" Contents Berman begins the book with a discussion of the September 11 attacks of 2001. He then details the ideology of Sayyid Qutb, an influential figure behind the development of Islamism, before moving on to a general overview of suicidal Islamic extremist violence that preceded the World Trade Center attacks. Berman argues against the two popular views that the success of groups such as al Qaeda are either, first, the lashing out of the socially oppressed or, second, an alien, distant product of a Muslim people with fundamentally anti-Western religious beliefs and values. Berman discusses the socio-cultural origins of fascism in modern Europe as well as the culmination of its ideals in the Holocaust and the Second World War. He also details the growth of Islamic extremist thinking, comparing and contrasting it with early 20th century revolutionary movements, and he states that the Islamic extremist struggle with liberal, pluralistic democracies is an outgrowth of that past trend. He uses the term \\"Muslim totalitarianism\\" as a shorthand summary of his thinking. In terms of individual Islamic terrorists and their cells, Berman draws upon the writings of Albert Camus and concurs with Camus' musing that \\"the sinister excites\\" and the \\"transgressions of suicide or murder arouse a thrill that sometimes takes an overtly sexual form.\\" He discusses militant attacks as a kind of emotional anti-rationalism that is both primal and very difficult for normal, modern people to comprehend. He additionally stresses the importance of staying strong against authoritarian extremists, arguing in support of assertive, preemptive war as well as active police efforts to root out the radicals within Muslim states themselves as well as in Western countries. He praises the decisions to launch the invasion of Afghanistan and invasion of Iraq. Berman, describing his overall view of the present danger, writes, As mentioned before, Berman hypothesizes that the spread of democracy in the Arab world, while highly difficult and involving a long struggle, is a fundamentally just cause. He writes in support of the George W. Bush administration's foreign policies, but he also condemns the President for credibility problems and incompetence, particularly how Berman thinks the Christian religious fundamentalism of Bush's domestic agenda undermines Bush's claims to support liberal democracy against militant Islamic fundamentalism. Berman argues in broad terms, though, \\"Freedom for others means safety for ourselves\\". Reviews and responses American atheist author Sam Harris cited Berman's book in his own work The End of Faith, which explored the same themes regarding jihadist terrorism and the nature of modern liberal democracy. Harris praised Berman's writing as providing a \\"beautiful primer on totalitarianism\\". Journalist and author Michael J. Totten has approvingly quoted from Berman's arguments and praised the work as a \\"brilliant book\\".http://www.worldaffairsjournal.org/blog/michael-j-totten/isis-wages- cultural-genocide-palmyra The Observer ran a mixed review by journalist Martin Bright. Bright supported some of the points made while also stating that, at times, \\"Berman trips over the ingenuity of his own argument\\". Bright also remarked, \\"Berman's description of a paranoid 'people of God' convinced of its own righteousness, prepared to kill its enemies and sacrifice its own in pursuit of a realm of pure truth might just as easily apply to the United States\\". Ellen Willis wrote for Salon.com that while Berman was correct in criticizing the repressive and inhumane policies of secular dictators such as Saddam Hussein and Islamic fundamentalist groups, Berman was deeply wrong in his praise for the Bush administration's foreign policies. More broadly, she stated that she saw the book as \\"an important entry in the debate over the meaning of 9/11 and after\\". Washington Monthly ran a mixed review by journalist Joshua Micah Marshall, who commented that \\"Berman's book is by turns penetrating, insightful, honest, sloppy, erudite, superficial, hot- blooded, serious, and florid.\\" Marshall also wrote, \\"Though this is a serious book, it is shot through with an equally serious flaw: the desire to inflate the threat of Islamist violence‚Äîand particularly its intellectual stakes‚Äîto levels beyond what they merit and to force them into a template of an earlier era, for which Berman has an evident and understandable nostalgia. Over the course of the book, the disjointedness between what the radical Islamist menace is and what Berman wants to make it ranges from merely apparent to downright painful, and ends up obscuring as much as it clarifies. And, unfortunately, the obscuring elements may be the more important ones. Given the role intellectuals are playing in this war, these are mistakes that could have dire real-world costs.

With his elder brother Charles Taylor, after some education at Brentford grammar school, he was brought up as an engraver in the studio of his father, and worked both in landscape and portraiture. During his apprenticeship the plates for Abraham Rees's edition of Chambers's Cyclopaedia were executed under his superintendence at his father's establishment, and he met Rees. In 1781 he commissioned Richard Smirke to paint four small circular subjects representing morning, noon, evening, and night, which he engraved and published; and two years later he painted and engraved a set of views on the Thames near London. In 1783 he moved from Islington to Red Lion Street, Holborn, and in June 1786 he left London for Lavenham in Suffolk, where he rented a house and a large garden.

In 1791 he engraved the assassination of Rizzio after John Opie (for which the Society of Arts awarded him their gold palette and twenty-five guineas), and in 1796 he completed a book of forty plates illustrating the architectural details of the fifteenth-century church at Lavenham, entitled Specimens of Gothic Ornaments selected from the parish church of Lavenham in Suffolk. He also sketched in watercolours and engraved a series of Suffolk mansions. Pastor From beginning of the Napoleonic Wars the export of English engravings, which had increased rapidly since 1775, as rapidly diminished. Taylor, who had acquired some fame locally as a preacher, moved to Colchester in 1796 on receiving a call to act as pastor to the independent congregation in Bucklersbury Lane. While there he continued working on plates for Boydell's Shakespeare which he had commenced at Lavenham. That of Henry VIII's first sight of Anne Boleyn, after Charles Alfred Stothard, was completed in 1802 and brought him ¬£500. In 1812 he engraved a set of designs for James Thomson's The Seasons. In December 1810 Taylor was called as nonconformist pastor to Ongar in Essex, and there he lived during the remaining eighteen years of his life. Taylor died on Saturday, 12 December 1829, and was buried on 19 December at Ongar. A portrait engraved by Blood from a drawing by himself was published in the Evangelical Magazine for 1818. Works The long series of books from Ongar by members of the family had them talked of as \\"Taylors of Ongar\\", to distinguish them from the contemporary literary family, the \\"Taylors of Norwich\\". The literary productiveness of the extended family of Isaac Taylor of Ongar, led Francis Galton Hereditary Genius (1869), to illustrate from the history of the family his theory of the distribution through heredity of intellectual capacity. Of a family of eleven, six survived childhood, and from the time of his residence at Lavenham Taylor dedicated his spare time to the education of his children; he himself was self-taught. Years of teaching led him to evolve a series of educational manuals. His own books were: *The Biography of a Brown Loaf (London, n.d.); *Self-cultivation recommended, or hints to a youth on leaving school (1817; 4th ed. 1820); *Advice to the Teens (1818, two editions); *Character essential to Success in Life (London, 1820); *Picturesque Piety, or Scripture Truths illustrated by forty-eight engravings, designed and engraved by the author (London, 1821); *Beginnings of British Biography: Lives of one hundred persons eminent in British Story (London, 2 vols., 1824, two editions); *Beginnings of European Biography (London, 2 vols. 1824‚Äì5; 3 vols. 1828‚Äì9); *Bunyan explained to a Child (London, 1824, 2 vols., and 1825); *The Balance of Criminality, or Mental Error, compared with Immoral Conduct (London, 1828). Taylor also issued, with engravings from designs mostly by himself (a few were by his son Isaac), a series of topographies: Scenes in Europe and Scenes in England (1819), extended to Scenes in Asia, Scenes in Africa, Scenes in America, Scenes in Foreign Lands, Scenes of British Wealth, and (posthumously in 1830) Scenes of Commerce by Land and Sea. Family On 18 April 1781 Taylor married at Islington Ann Martin, and had issue: The Taylor family, painted by their father. *Ann born at Islington on 30 January 1782, who married Joseph Gilbert; *Jane Taylor; *two Isaacs who died in infancy; *Isaac (1787‚Äì1865); * Martin Taylor (1788‚Äì1867), the father of Helen Taylor (see below); *Harriet, Eliza, and Decimus, who died in infancy; *Jefferys; *and Jemima (1798‚Äì1886), who married, on 14 August 1832, Thomas Herbert. Born on 20 June 1757, from the time of the move to Lavenham in 1786 Mrs. Ann Taylor (1757‚Äì1830) shared the educational ideals of her husband. She corresponded with her children during their absences from home, and this correspondence was the nucleus of a series of short manuals of conduct: * 'Advice to Mothers' (London, n.d.); * 'Maternal Solicitude for a Daughter's best Interests' (London, 1813; 12th ed. 1830); * 'Practical Hints to Young Females, or the duties of a wife, a mother, and a mistress of a family' (London, 1815; 11th ed. 1822); * 'The Present of a Mistress to a Young Servant' (London, 1816; several editions); * 'Reciprocal Duties of Parents and Children' (London, 1818; 3rd ed. 1819); * 'The Family Mansion' (London, 1819; a French version appeared in the same year; 2nd ed. 1820); * 'Retrospection, a Tale' (London, 1821); * 'The Itinerary of a Traveller in the Wilderness' (London, 1825,); and also * 'Correspondence between a Mother and her Daughter [Jane] at School' (London, 1817; 6th ed. 1821). Ann Taylor died at Ongar on 4 June 1830; she was buried beside her husband under the vestry floor of Ongar chapel. Helen Taylor (1818‚Äì1885), the daughter of Martin Taylor of Ongar (1788‚Äì1867), by his first wife, Elizabeth Venn, made contributions to 'Missionary Hymns' and the 'Teacher's Treasury,' and, besides a short devotional work, 'Sabbath Bells' was author of 'The Child's Books of Homilies' (London, 1850). She died in 1885, and was buried at Parkstone, Dorset.

It is usually found living on the surface of a sea snail shell in which a hermit crab is living. Description C. polypus can grow up to 8 cm (3 in) long. Several anemones can grow on one shell. The base is wide with wavy edges and pink striations and flares out over the shell surface. The column is wider at the base than further up and has pale brown and white patches and longitudinal striations. The oral disc has several whorls of long brownish translucent tentacles with paler bases surrounding the mouth.Hermit crab anemone Retrieved 2011-09-10. Distribution C. polypus is found in the Indo-Pacific area and the Red Sea. It lives in the neritic zone at depths down to about 25 metres (80 ft). Ecology C. polypus lives as a commensal with several species of hermit crab including Dardanus gemmatus. The anemone shows no inclination to attach itself to a gastropod shell with or without a hermit crab. However the crab shows great interest in the anemone and taps and massages the base of the column with its legs until the anemone relaxes and the pedal disc becomes detached. The crab then picks up the anemone and holds it against the shell in which it is living. Both the pedal disc and the tentacles are very sticky and either can quickly form a firm attachment to the shell.The commensal association of Calliactis polypus and the hermit crab Dardanus gemmatus in Hawaii Retrieved 2011-09-10.

Zartenbach  The headstreams of the upper reaches of the Rotbach, known as the Zartenbach, begin on the territory of Hinterzarten (Southern Black Forest Nature Park) southwest of the village of Oberzarten on the eastern mountainside of the Ramseleh√∂he (1,111,9 m) at about 1,085 metres above sea level. They gather on the bottom of a valley basin with a stepped longitudinal profile that was formed by an ice age glacier. On one of the levels the stream is impounded to form the pond of Mathisleweiher (). Thereafter it flows in a broad left-hand arc around the Windeck (1,209 m) and passes through Oberzarten and Hinterzarten northwards in the broad hollow of the level Hinterzarten Moor (nature reserve).  L√∂ffeltalbach  After picking up the outflow of the western part of the moor, the stream deepens as it enters a V-shaped valley and descends steeply. The valley is named after the old workshops here that used to make wooden spoons (Holzl√∂ffeln). Through this valley used to run the L√∂ffeltalsteige, the ascent from the H√∂llental valley to the heights of Hinterzarten.  H√∂llenbach  In the H√∂llental the L√∂ffeltalbach merges with the Ravennabach coming from Ravenna Gorge to the northeast. The stream, now called the H√∂llenbach, flows northwest initially through the straight trough valley of the upper H√∂llental which was formed by ice age glaciers. It then comes to a gorge-like section of the valley which is known as the Hirschsprung or H√∂llenpass. The stream is accompanied by the B 31 and H√∂llentalbahn as it continues through the H√∂llental.  Rotbach  In the lower section of the valley, the stream continues as the Rotbach through Falkensteig and Himmelreich (villages in the municipality of Buchenbach), where it flows out into the plain of the Zarten Basin.

He has also played in MLB for the Milwaukee Brewers, Houston Astros, and Detroit Tigers. Fiers has pitched two no-hitters (one in 2015 and the other in 2019), the latter being the 300th no-hitter in MLB history. Fiers is also known for being the whistleblower in the Houston Astros sign stealing scandal. College career After graduating from Deerfield Beach High School in Deerfield Beach, Florida in 2003, Fiers enrolled at Broward College and played college baseball for the Broward Seahawks in 2004. He transferred to the University of the Cumberlands for one year, in 2007, and had a 7‚Äì2 win‚Äìloss record and 3.68 earned run average (ERA) in 10 games for the Cumberland Patriots. In January 2008, Fiers fell asleep while driving on the Florida Turnpike, crashed into a guard rail, and was ejected through the windshield of the car. He broke four vertebrae. After recovering, Fiers then transferred to Nova Southeastern University. Pitching for the Nova Southeastern Sharks in 2009, Fiers recorded a 10‚Äì3 record, a 2.65 ERA, and 145 strikeouts in innings pitched, leading all of college baseball in strikeouts and breaking the Sharks' school record. Professional career =Milwaukee Brewers= The Milwaukee Brewers selected Fiers in the 22nd round of the 2009 Major League Baseball draft. He began his career playing for the Rookie league Helena Brewers, Class A Wisconsin Timber Rattlers, and Class A-Advanced Brevard County Manatees in 2009. Fiers played the 2010 season at Brevard and with the Double-A Huntsville Stars. He began the 2011 season with Huntsville, but was promoted to the Triple-A Nashville Sounds in late May 2011. Fiers was called up to the majors for the first time on September 10, 2011. He appeared in two games in the major leagues in 2011. On August 7, 2012, Fiers carried a perfect game into the 7th inning in a game against the Cincinnati Reds. He pitched eight innings allowing one run on three hits, earning the victory. For the season, he started 22 games for the Brewers, going 9‚Äì10 with a 3.74 ERA in innings. The following year, he was ineffective all season, only starting 3 times while making 8 relief appearances. In 2014, Fiers split time between the majors and the AAA level. On September 11, pitching against the Miami Marlins, Fiers hit Giancarlo Stanton in the face with an fastball, causing Stanton to be hospitalized. With his next pitch, Fiers proceeded to hit Reed Johnson (pinch hitter who was completing Stanton's plate appearance) on one of his hands when he attempted to paint the inside corner. Both pitches were called strikes, because the batters were in the act of swinging. Miami third-baseman Casey McGehee, the on-deck batter, started yelling at the umpire, but Fiers thought that McGehee was yelling at him, so he tried to say that he did not do it on purpose; this then caused a bench-clearing shouting match. Fiers apologized to Stanton, and on September 12, Fiers was fined an undisclosed amount for causing the benches to clear. He finished the season 6‚Äì5 despite posting an ERA of 2.13. In 14 games, 10 starts, he struck out 76 in . On May 7, 2015, Fiers became the 73rd pitcher in MLB history to record an Immaculate inning when he struck out Enrique Hernandez, Carlos Frias, and Joc Pederson on 9 consecutive pitches in the fourth inning. In 21 starts, Fiers was 5‚Äì9 with an ERA of 3.89. In 118 innings, he struck out 121. =Houston Astros= On July 30, 2015, the Brewers traded Fiers and Carlos G√≥mez to the Houston Astros for Brett Phillips, Domingo Santana, Josh Hader, and Adrian Houser. On August 21, in his third start for the Astros, Fiers pitched a no-hitter against the Los Angeles Dodgers at Minute Maid Park, the 11th no-hitter in Astros history and the first for any team at Minute Maid Park. It was his first complete game as a major league pitcher. He finished the game with a career-high 134 pitches thrown, striking out 10 batters and walking three. He finished 2‚Äì1 for Houston the rest of the 2015 season. The following season, in 2016, he established a career high with 11 wins. He led the major leagues in wild pitches, with 17. On September 14, 2017, Fiers was suspended five games for throwing a pitch aimed at the head of Luis Valbuena. Fiers made 29 appearances (28 starts), finishing the year with an 8‚Äì10 record and a 5.22 ERA. The Astros finished the 2017 season with a 101‚Äì61 record, clinching an AL West pennant. Fiers did not participate in the playoffs, but was still on the 40-man roster at the time. The Astros won the 2017 World Series, giving Fiers his first career championship ring. =Detroit Tigers= On December 8, 2017, Fiers signed a one-year, $6 million contract with the Detroit Tigers. Fiers went through extended spring training due to a back injury, and was not on the Tigers 2018 opening day roster. He joined the team on April 8 and won his Tiger debut with six scoreless innings against the Chicago White Sox. On April 21, Fiers became just the second Tigers player since 1908 to give up 10 or more hits in fewer than six innings, strike out nobody and earn a victory, and the first Tigers player to do since Dan Petry in 1984. Fiers compiled a 7‚Äì6 record and a 3.48 ERA in 21 starts for the 2018 Tigers before being traded. =Oakland Athletics= On August 6, 2018, Fiers was traded to the Oakland Athletics for two players to be named later or cash considerations. Minor league pitcher Nolan Blackwood was later identified as one of the players. On August 14, Fiers earned his first win with the A's, surrendering two runs and striking out five over six innings against the Seattle Mariners. On September 19, minor league pitcher Logan Shore was traded to the Tigers to complete the trade for Fiers. For the season, between the two teams he was 12‚Äì8 with a 3.56 ERA. He had the lowest line drive percentage allowed (17.3%) of all major league pitchers. On November 30, 2018, the Athletics non-tendered Fiers and he became a free agent. He signed a two-year contract with the Athletics on December 24. On May 7, 2019, Fiers threw a no-hitter at Oakland-Alameda County Coliseum against the Cincinnati Reds, striking out six and walking two. It was the second no-hitter of his career, and the 300th in MLB history. Fiers finished 2019 with a record of 15‚Äì4 with an ERA of 3.90 in 33 starts. In innings, he struck out 126. Role in Houston Astros sign stealing scandal In November 2019, Fiers revealed to journalists Ken Rosenthal and Evan Drelich of The Athletic that in 2017 the Astros used a video camera in center field to steal signs from opposing teams. This was the catalyst for an MLB investigation into the Houston Astros sign stealing scandal. Some baseball commentators, including analyst Jessica Mendoza and former pro Pedro Martinez, have criticized Fiers for coming forward publicly, but many in the baseball community defended his move as necessary to restore the integrity of the game. Scouting report Fiers throws four pitches. He leads with a four-seam fastball at . He also has a slider (), curveball (), and changeup (). He also experiments with a cutter in the mid 80's for some extra movement to induce ground balls or surprise hitters. His primary off-speed pitch to lefties is the changeup and to righties is the curveball. His changeup is considered by many to be his best pitch, and he has excellent command of the strikezone with all of his pitches. Despite having relatively low velocity, his command, the movement of his pitches (particularly his slow, looping curveball) all make him quite capable of racking up strikeouts. He had a K/9 of 9.6 during his four years in the minors, and has a respectable K/9 of 8.4 in the majors.

This pathway is not found in animals (including humans), who must instead obtain these essential amino acids from their diet. This can be through either the direct consumption of plants or microorganisms, or their indirect consumption via the consumption of other animals. The seven enzymes involved in the shikimate pathway are DAHP synthase, 3-dehydroquinate synthase, 3-dehydroquinate dehydratase, shikimate dehydrogenase, shikimate kinase, EPSP synthase, and chorismate synthase. The pathway starts with two substrates, phosphoenol pyruvate and erythrose-4-phosphate, and ends with chorismate, a substrate for the three aromatic amino acids. The fifth enzyme involved is the shikimate kinase, an enzyme that catalyzes the ATP-dependent phosphorylation of shikimate to form shikimate 3-phosphate (shown in the figure below). Shikimate 3-phosphate is then coupled with phosphoenol pyruvate to give 5-enolpyruvylshikimate-3-phosphate via the enzyme 5-enolpyruvylshikimate-3-phosphate (EPSP) synthase. :450px Then 5-enolpyruvylshikimate-3-phosphate is transformed into chorismate by a chorismate synthase. :450px Prephenic acid is then synthesized by a Claisen rearrangement of chorismate by chorismate mutase. :350px Prephenate is oxidatively decarboxylated with retention of the hydroxyl group to give p-hydroxyphenylpyruvate, which is transaminated using glutamate as the nitrogen source to give tyrosine and Œ±-ketoglutarate. :450px  References   Bibliography   * Category:Metabolic pathways ","title":"Shikimate pathway"},{"id":"33044501","text":"The Schwarza is a river in the districts of Waldshut and Breisgau- Hochschwarzwald in Baden-W√ºrttemberg, Germany.

The sites are located south of Wallace, Idaho in the Idaho Panhandle National Forests. Pulaski's tunnel and escape route are listed on the National Register of Historic Places in 1984.  Fire of 1910  The summer of 1910 was hot and dry, with an extremely high fire danger throughout the western United States. By August, there were approximately 1,400 wildfires burning out of control in northern Idaho, northeastern Washington, and northwestern Montana. On 20 August, some of these wildfires blew-up into huge firestorms, threatening a number of rural communities and trapping firefighting crews.

Pulaski and his crew were fighting the fire in an area around the west fork of Placer Creek, approximately southwest of Wallace. When the fire became too dangerous, Pulaski ordered his forty-five men to evacuate toward Wallace. As they retreated, a second fire blocked their way, leaving them surrounded by fire. Pulaski knew the area so he was able to lead his men through the burning forest to an abandoned mine. The crew (along with two horses) entered the mine opening near the bank of Placer Creek just as the fire engulfed the area.Pulaski, E. C., \\"Surrounded by Forest Fires‚ÄîMy Most Exciting Experience as a Forest Ranger\\" , American Forestry (Volume 29), American Forests, Washington, District of Columbia, August 1923, pp. 485-486.

As the fire raged outside the mine, the heat caused the cold air in the tunnel to rush out, replacing it with hot air and smoke. Pulaski ordered the men to lie down on the floor of the mine where there was still some breathable air. As the fire closed in around the tunnel entrance, timber beams at the mouth of the tunnel began to burn. Pulaski carried water in his hat from pools on the mine floor to the entrance, trying to douse the flames. In the process, he was badly burned. Eventually, Pulaski fell unconscious, as did all his men. The next morning, Pulaski counted 39 living men. One of his crew had been killed by a falling snag on the way to the mine; five others had died from smoke inhalation during the night (the two horses also died). After the fire in the surrounding forest died down, Pulaski and his crew followed Placer Creek to safety in Wallace.\\"Pulaski Tunnel Trail\\", Idaho Panhandle National Forests, United states Forest Service, United States Department of Agriculture, Coeur d'Alene, Idaho, accessed 20 December 2014.

It was built to cater for the then growing population of the village. Ian Nairn, in the Sussex volume of The Buildings of England, approves of the simplicity of this \\"flint village church\\" and comments that most \\"other counties would have had it much fussier\\". History Houses were built in the village in the eighteenth century, and expansion increased after the Partridge Green railway station was opened in 1861. The settlement was served from 1884 by an iron mission room in nearby Jolesfield. The new church was built in 1890 on a site given by the Rev. John Goring, with the memorial stone laid by Lady Burrell on 30 May 1890. The church was designed in thirteenth century style by the architectural firm of W.G. Habershon and J.F. Fawkner. The church was served by curates until 1946, since when it has been served by the rector of West Grinstead. Description The nave of St Michael and All Angels Church The church consists of a chancel, nave and west tower. Entry is by a south porch. The exterior is constructed of flint with stone dressings. Inside the walls are of exposed brick. The rere-arches of the lancet windows and the tower and chancel arches are of stone. The timber framed roof is described by John Allen as the best feature. The tower has a tiled pyramidal cap. Fittings and windows The font may have been cut from an earlier medieval original. The east window is by C.E.

Mirat, also known as Grupo Mirat (Mirat Group), or just as Mirat, is a Spanish company founded in 1812 in Salamanca, dedicated mainly to production of manures and fertilizers. Nowadays it is one of the 100 biggest companies in Castile and Le√≥n and the biggest one in the agricultural sector in the province of Salamanca. Its commercial activity is focused on Spain and Portugal. Its trademark Vitaterra is the largest Spanish manufacturer of garden manures and fertilizers. The factories and structures of Mirat is the only well conserved prototype of the industry of Salamanca from the 19th century. The interior of the factory contains the remains of the Convent of Nuestra Se√±ora de la Victoria (Our Lady of the Victory) of the 15th century, which belonged to the Order of Hieronymites. History Wood pillaring of the beginning of the 20th century, in the old workshops of Mirat in Salamanca. The origins of the company began in 1812, the year in which Gregorio Mirat installed a starch factory in Salamanca (Spain). Afterwards, different lines of the business were developed. In 1841 his son Juan Casimiro was born, he would be very important in the development of Mirat. In 1853 Gregorio introduced his son into the business, and later the factory was called \\"Mirat e Hijo\\" (Mirat and Son). Juan Casimiro applied knowledge acquired on his trip to France and in 1876 the company started to export abroad. The same year, in 1876, the factory was moved near to the river Tormes to the Convent of Saint Jerome. In 1881, rice starch, which was important for ironing clothes started to be produced. During this time it turned into the one of the first factories of Salamanca that began to use steam as a motive power. Also at their disposal was one storehouse near to the old main square that in 1902 Casimiro decided to use for reconstruction and build some small hotels. That is why even now that place is known as \\"Avenida de Mirat\\" (Avenue of Mirat). In 1933 the company began to work as a cooperative association and in 1963 they begin to produce compound manures. The building of the factory of Mirat is the only well-conserved industrial architecture of the 19th century in Salamanca. Convent of Nuestra Se√±ora de la Victoria Inside the workshops of the factory there is the Convent of Nuestra Se√±ora de la Victoria (Our Lady of the Victory) which belonged to the Order of Saint Jerome, which was founded in 1490 and after 3rd centuries of prosperity was destroyed by French troops during the Peninsular war. After unsuccessful industrial experiences that demolished the main part of the building the area finally fell into Mirat family hands. They then organized the production of manures using a religious part of the building that was, still is, in good condition. The factory still has remains of the walls, cellars and some parts of the old convent. Between the remains stands a huge vaulted arch of 3 meters by Juan de √Ålava (designer of the Casa de las Muertes (House of Death), of the College Fonseca and of the \\"Seven Emblems of the University of Salamanca\\") and some others stone emblems. The flues, the workshops of the 16th century, high arcades of bricks and arches complete the testimony of the industrialization period.

After oil field development began during the Second Sudanese Civil War, Block 5A was the scene of extensive fighting as rival militias struggled for control. Out of an original population of 240,000, an estimated 12,000 were killed or died of starvation and 160,000 were displaced by force. Production started in 2006. There is evidence that the environmentally sensitive marshlands beside the Nile are becoming polluted. European companies have been accused of complicity in clearance of the population from the oil field. Location The Block 5A concession covers the central part of Unity State on the west of the White Nile, extending west into Warrap State and East into Jonglei State to the east of the Nile. Block 5A is part of a huge, fertile floodplain fed by rivers from the Congo, Uganda, Kenya and Ethiopia. In the dry season the land becomes parched. Pastoralists move their herds from one area to another in search of grazing, usually staying close to a river or permanent wetland. In the wet season, the low-lying lands are covered in flood water, and the herders move to higher ground. Block 5A is populated by Nuer people of the Bul, Leek, Jagei, Western Jikany and Dok sections. The town of Leer, in Dok Nuer territory, is in a key position in the block. On the east of the Nile the southern part of Zeraf island lies in Block 5a, populated mostly by Thiang Nuer. Geologically, Block 5A is located in the Muglad Basin, which extends from South Sudan north into Sudan and is rich in oil deposits. The Tharjiath field in Block 5A has an area of . Reserves at the Tharjiath field are said to be 250 million barrels. Mala field was expected to start production with 10,000 bpd in 2007 which would go up to 20,000 bpd by 2008. Mala was thought to have 44 million barrels of reserves. Oil has also been found in Jarayan field. Struggle for control Sudan was in a state of civil war for most of the years following independence in 1956, apart from a temporary respite between 1972 and 1983. After hostilities resumed, the Sudan People's Liberation Movement/Army (SPLM/A) captured Leer from the government in March 1986, and the town became a stronghold of the rebel commander Riek Machar, who had been born there. In August 1991 Riek Machar broke away from John Garang's mainstream branch of the SPLM/A. Machar's breakaway faction was called the SPLM/A-Nasir faction from 1991 to 1993, and then the South Sudan Independence Army (SSIA) from 1994 to 1997. In 1996 Riek signed a Political Charter and in 1997 the Khartoum Peace Agreement with the government. Riek was made commander in chief of the South Sudan Defense Force (SSDF), which included most of the ex-rebels who had signed the Khartoum agreement. His forces controlled Block 5A. The swampy and inaccessible region had no strategic value to the Khartoum government before the approach of the pipeline that was built from Port Sudan on the Red Sea to Heglig, not far to the north. The underground pipeline opened in 1999. In 1998, oil exploration began to ramp up in the Block 5A concession area, and Paulino Matiep's South Sudan Unity Movement (SSUM) militia began pushing civilians out. There was growing tension between Riek Machar's SSDF and Paulino Matip's SSUM. Both groups wanted the rewards from providing security to the oil companies. In 1998‚Äì1999, Paulino's fighters and government troops clashed several times with Riek's forces in a struggle for control of the Unity state oilfields. Peter Gadet led Paulino Matiep's militia as they marauded through Block 5A in early 1999. His fighters forced Tito Biel, a high-ranking SSDF commander, to evacuate Leer. By April 1999 Tito Biel's SSDF forces in Western Upper Nile were cooperating with the Sudan People's Liberation Army (SPLA) forces in Bahr el Ghazal, who were supplying arms. On arrival in Yirol early in May 1999 Tito formally declared that he had switched to the SPLA, along with his officers and men. In September 1999 Peter Gadet also mutinied, going over to the SPLA. On 29 September 1999 Gadet shelled Paulino's base of Mayom, causing flight of civilians to Block 5A in the east of the state. For several months after September 1999 Tito coordinated with Gadet in attacking various oil-related targets in Unity State. With the end of the civil war in January 2005 the fighting died down. However, security problems continue. After the April 2010 elections, Colonel Gatluak Gai of Koch County in Block 5A was dissatisfied with the results and rebelled. He eventually made peace with the SPLA in July 2011, but was killed three days later. On 11 April 2011 Gatluak Gai's son-in-law, Major General Peter Gadet, now of the \\"South Sudan Liberation Army\\", published the \\"Mayom Declaration\\". He denounced government by the \\"current corrupt gangs in Juba\\" and called for the government of Southern Sudan to be replaced by a national broad-base transitional government. Gadet began an assault on the SPLA in Unity state, leaving at least 45 people dead. According to the military, 20 of the victims were southern army soldiers. Oil field development and production The Chevron Corporation prospected for oil in Block 5A, and in 1982 reportedly found oil about fours hours walk northwest of Koch. However, Chevron stopped oil exploration after three of their expatriate oil workers were killed by rebels in February 1984. After the resumption of exploration and development, on 6 February 1997 the Sudanese Government granted the block 5A concession to a consortium of Lundin Oil of Sweden, OMV of Austria, Petronas of Malaysia and Sudapet of Sudan. Lundin's 40.375% stake was held by their Canadian subsidiary International Petroleum Corporation (IPC). OMV agreed to purchase their 27.5% interest in the Block 5A project on 3 June 1997. Petronas already had a pending assignment of a 30% interest. In 2002, Lundin and Talisman Energy swapped some of their assets, but the Lundin family kept control of their block 5A assets. Block 5A was the main asset of Lundin Oil's successor Lundin Petroleum between 2001 and 2003. In 1998 the consortium established a drilling site at Ryer, in Jagei Nuer territory, near the port of Thar Jath on the Nile. In 1998 they built an unpaved road from Bentiu to the north via Duar and Guk to Ryer and Thar Jath. They gave little work to the local people, but brought in hundreds of Arab and Chinese laborers. The consortium undertook seismic tests, and by October 2000 had acquired over of data. The first exploration well at the Thar Jath field was spudded on 7 April 1999, expected to reach the Cretaceous Bentiu and Darfur sandstones at a depth of around in four to six weeks. In May 2000, Lundin suspended operations after rebels attacked the Thar Jath rig and killed three government employees. They resumed in March 2001 after the local population had been forcibly removed, but halted once more in January 2002. According to a Lundin report: \\"... in view of increasing instability in the area, to ensure maximum security for its personnel and operations, the Consortium decided to suspend seismic and drilling activities on Block 5A as a precautionary measure\\". In March 2003, Lundin said there had been \\"positive developments in the peace process and the improved conditions in its concession area\\" and said that it was planning to undertake infrastructure work \\"as a first step towards an eventual recommencement of activities\\". In June 2003 Lundin Petroleum completed sale its working interest in Block 5A to Petronas Carigali for USD 142.5 million. In August 2003 ONGC Videsh (OVL) of India was given approval to acquire the 26.125% stake owned by OMV in Block 5A. On 2 September 2003 OVL bought OMV's stake in Blocks 5a and 5B for $135 million. In 2006 White Nile (5B) Petroleum Operating Co started production at the Thar Jath field in Block 5A on behalf of the Contractors (Petronas, ONGC and Sudapet). The company was jointly owned by Petronas of Malaysia (50%) and Sudapet of Sudan (50%). The initial rate of production was 40,000 bbl/day, expected to rise to 54,000 bbl/day by 2009 and then to decline to 39,000 bbl/day in 2011. Crude oil from the field is treated at a new central processing facility, then transported via a new 172-kilometer pipeline to a pump station in Heglig owned and operated by Greater Nile Petroleum Operating Company (GNPOC). From there it is carried by GNPOC's pipeline to Port Sudan on the Red Sea. A 2005 estimate of total development effort for Thar Jath field was US$311 million. Assuming a Brent price of US$25 per barrel, that would give an Internal Rate of Return of just over 22%. Human impact Unlike other oilfields in Sudan, there was no forcible displacement of the civilian population until about 1998, when the consortium led by Lundin Oil started exploration. At that time a government-supported Nuer militia under Major General Paulino Matiep began attacking communities in Block 5A, including Leer. Residents fled to the marshes, where many died of malaria. The Khartoum government wanted to clear all civilians away from the oil facilities, roads and pipeline. Riek Machar's less violent approach was rejected. In the region around the Ryer/Tharjiath headquarters, the population was forced to leave with little notice in 1998, taking only their cattle. Their houses were destroyed. Between June 1997 and November 1998 fighting between factions in the Nhialdiu area caused about 70% of the population to flee to Bentiu and Mankien. In early 1998 villages around Nhialdiu were looted and destroyed. The health center in Nhialdiu was destroyed. In May 1998 Oxfam began an emergency program to assist 25,000 people in Unity State displaced through insecurity. In June 1998 Duar town was attacked. The M√©decins Sans Fronti√®res compound was burned and destroyed, as were the school and the community offices. Paulino's forces raided cattle camps, killing the animals for food. Many of the population fled, some to islands in the Nile where they felt they would be safe. Paulino's forces raided the area around Koch three times in 1998, destroying chapels, clinics, schools and government buildings. Again, those who could escape did so. Sudanese government troop arrived near Leer in April 1998, but SSDF forces kept them from entering the town. In June, July and August Paulino Matiep's forces attacked Leer, looting and destroying houses and buildings such as the hospital, NGO compounds and churches. After the attacks, the WFP said that Leer had become a ghost town. According to a WFP representative: \\"Over the past months thousands of people have fled without food or belongings. They've been forced to hide for days in the surrounding swamps and outlying villages, living in constant fear and surviving on just water lilies [a wild food] and fish. Their own villages have been burned down and their grain stores have been looted\\". The United Nations Office for the Coordination of Humanitarian Affairs defined Unity State as being an area of acute emergency, the worst possible classification. A major government operation began in block 5A in early 2002 after a Lundin helicopter had been shot down. Civilians along the oil road were the main target, and again there were many casualties and many were forced to flee. Despite a cease-fire agreement, in April 2003 the government opened another offensive in Block 5A. Soon after, Lundin sold its interest in the concession. A study of Landsat data between 1999 and 2004 showed major shifts in land use that closely corresponded to reports of fighting in the block. Between 1999 and 2002 most farming activity stopped in the bands that extended on each side of the newly built oil roads. Traditional farming areas were abandoned and there was a gradual drift of farming activity towards the south and west. By 2002 there was no sign of any farming activity around Nhialdiu, where a series of village attacks had been reported for the last three years. Reports of attacks by government forces in the period from January to April 2002 in Western Upper Nile (Unity State) said Antonov bombers, helicopter gunships, horsemen and Government of Sudan ground forces and militia were involved. Many civilians were killed. A report published by the International Crisis Group on 10 February 2003 described a renewed push to clear the road south from Bentiu to the port of Adok on the Nile. It said \\"The offensive from late December until the beginning of February was an extension of the government‚Äôs long-time strategy of depopulating oilrich areas through indiscriminate attacks on civilians in order to clear the way for further development of infrastructure. Eyewitness accounts confirm that the tactics included the abduction of women and children, gang rapes, ground assaults supported by helicopter gunships, destruction of humanitarian relief sites, and burning of villages. Environmental impact Examination of Landsat images in 2006 showed that the all-weather roads built to access the oil fields have disrupted the drainage patterns of the marshes. A blockage more than was first seen in 2003 to the north of the Thar Jath oil field. Given that the field is just from the Nile and that there is a risk of oil contamination, this is a serious concern. On 8 November 2004 a thick black cloud with a 13 km black fane was visible in the Thar Jath oil field, possibly indicating a blowout and resultant oil spill. In March 2008 there were reports that children in Koch had died from drinking contaminated water. Local officials said that over 1,000 people were suffering from unknown illnesses. Large amounts of saline water are injected into the sub-surface around the oil reservoirs to maintain oil pressure, and this can cause health problems if people drink the water. Witnesses also said that toxic waste was being dumped into pits in the dried swamp, which would flood into the marshes in the rainy season. In November 2009 the German NGO Sign of Hope reported that in the village of Rier, close to the Thar Jath Central Processing Facility, there were critical levels of salts and contaminants such as cyanides, lead, nickel, cadmium and arsenic. This water can cause serious health problems. The pollution was also affecting the Sudd wetlands, deemed to be of international importance under the Ramsar convention. Controversy A report by Human Rights Watch published in 2003 claimed that Lundin and other oil companies had deliberately ignored the violent methods the Sudanese government had used to clear land for the companies' activities. The report said \\"Human Rights Watch believes that the companies in the two oil consortiums during the 1998-2002 period covered in this report, Talisman (Blocks 1, 2 and 4) and Lundin Petroleum (Block 5A), and their partners CNPC, Petronas and OMV, have benefitted from the government's continued abuses of human rights\\". There was an outcry in Sweden, and Lundin sold its stake to Petronas. In their 2006 Annual Report, Lundin emphasises that they paid strict attention to international norms related to human rights, and that they implemented a Community Development and Humanitarian Assistance Program to assist local communities in obtaining water supply, health care and education. Talisman Energy, a Canadian company, had already been subject to a critical report prepared for the Canadian government in 2000, although it denied knowing of any human rights abuses. In October 2002, Talisman announced that it was selling its interests in Sudan to ONGC Videsh. The Talisman President said \\"Shareholders have told me they were tired of continually having to monitor and analyse events relating to Sudan\\". OMV eventually closed the deal to sell its stake to ONGC in May 2004, backdated to 1 January 2003. In June 2010, a Swedish public prosecutor said an inquiry was being opened into whether any of Lundin's Swedish employees broke the law. The investigation was triggered by an 8 June 2010 report published by the European Coalition on Oil in the Sudan, an NGO based in the Netherlands. The report claims that Lundin's decision to explore and then extract oil from Block 5A started the war for control of the area. The report asserts that Lundin contributed material used in the war and cooperated with the forces responsible for many of the crimes. Lundin denied the allegations. The investigation is sensitive because Carl Bildt, Swedish Foreign Minister, was a board member during the years when the alleged abuse occurred. OMV, which is 31% owned by the Austrian government, was also implicated by the report. Impact of secession of South Sudan Petronas Carigali Nile, ONGC Videsh Ltd and Nile Petroleum Corporation (also known as Nilepet, the national oil company of South Sudan) signed a Transition Agreement on January 13, 2012 with the Government of Republic of South Sudan for the continuation of its right for petroleum exploration and exploitation in Block 5A. The partners of Block 5A have incorporated a new operating company Sudd Petroleum Operating Company (SPOC) registered in Mauritius on March 7, 2012. The block is now jointly operated by all partners.

(a district of Burladingen), a few dozen meters north of the hamlet Neuweiler, which belongs to Albstadt. For historical reasons, the valley created by the Starzel, about 14 kilometres long on the northern edge of the Swabian Alb from its source to Hechingen is called Killer Valley. It is named after the village Killer, whose parish was responsible for the whole valley. The name Killer is historically composed of church and hamlet. Near Hechingen the Starzel is fed on the left side by the Reichenbach. It now flows more to the west and is then at Stauffenburger Hof again strengthened from the left side by its longest tributary, the Zimmerbach.

Geology and geomorphology  The valley of the Starzel, called \\"Killertal\\" in its upper course (view up the valley). From the front the villages Killer, Starzeln and Hausen im Killertal, all districts of Burladingen. Cut bank near Hechingen-Stein with border outcrop between Jura and Keuper] From the White Jurassic to the Muschelkalk the Starzel passes through all layers of the Jurassic and about two thirds of the Triassic. Its valley was formed by retrograde Erosion, in that the stream from the northwest cut deeper and deeper into the strata of the Swabian Alb and its foreland. The valley of the Starzel river intervenes eleven kilometres into the plateau of the Swabian Alb and is bordered in the west by the 957 high Raichberg and in the east by the up to 840 meter high hayfield. It begins with the source area of the Starzel and its tributaries at the watershed between the river system of the Rhine and that of the Danube. A special feature are the so-called waterfall layers, a hard sandstone, which is bedded over leafy shale clays. Between Jungingen and Schlatt the Starzel has formed an eight meter high waterfall, the Junginger Gie√ü. For long stretches it moves in a near-natural stream bed. Between Jungingen and Hechingen it has deepened like a canyon.  Starzel flood 2008  In the evening of 2 June 2008, a thunderstorm caused heavy rainfall and flooding, as a result of which three women drowned, two in Jungingen and one in Hechingen.

Geography The river near Enzweihingen. The source of the river is in the grounds of Weissach in B√∂blingen and flows in a narrow, northeasterly direction. It can reach a depth of 100m into the landscape Strudelbachtal. Between Weissach and Eberdingen, it crosses the border to the district of Ludwigsburg. After 15 km, it flows into the River Enz in Enzweihingen. In its course, it passes through the villages of Strudelbachhalle, Weissach, Eberdingen, Riet and Enzweihingen. It forms a natural border between Strohg√§u and Heckeng√§u. History The documented history of Strudelback extends into the 4th Millennium BC and before. It was used as a transport stream and the water was used in mills and as an energy source. At least 10 mills have existed on the river, and at least two companies have continued to use its hydropower. The drainage basin is 55 square miles and in local situations it is relatively narrow and few serious flooding events are known, similar to other rivers in the area. The last flood of the river was on 6 July 2006, measured in Enzweihingen an outflow of 13 m / s (normal level is about 2 m / s), there was little damage to the local villages. The largest flood in the Strudelbach was in February 1940, when intense heat made snow melt rapidly. However, only the creek to the right of the river had any serious damage. Agriculture The river flows through an agriculturally and industrially used valley. The side slopes of the river are steep, especially at the junctions of small valleys, which have been used for a long time for wine cultivation. Today, wine is cultivated mainly as a hobby, but some former vineyards are used for recreation.

First of all, flowing eastward, the stream creates a nearly one and a half kilometer long northern arc, and then it flows south. After continuing for almost the same distance again, mostly on the edge of the forests Kohlhau and Hartwald, it reaches the mouth of Kaibach, the first major inlet, which joins the stream from the right as the Talbach enters the forest. Immediately afterwards the stream becomes a swampy brook . The stream sporadically emerges and disappears again, flowing through the valley section of the forest, and through the natural monument stone gutter (\\"Felsent√§le\\") in the Hartwald. The stream then continues in a westerly direction and picks up the almost equally long Annenbach from the right, at the edge of the forest. In the corridor, the shorter Krebsbach flows out of the Hartwald into the Talbach, which is already near the northern outskirts of Menningen. The Weiherbach inlet then joins the stream from the northeast, at which point, the Talbach pivots.

His mantra, ‚ÄúJo Kherray so Khaey‚Äù (), means, \\"The one who plows has the foremost right on the yield.\\" His popularity forced the feudal landlords to contact Farrukhsiyar, who ordered the ruler of northern Sindh Mian Yar Muhammad Kalhoro to uproot Inayat and his companions. A prolonged siege of Jhok resulted in an offer of negotiations from the Kalhora commander. Sufi Inayat accepted the offer to avoid further bloodshed, but was instead arrested and later executed in Thatto. Early life  Shah Inayat was born in 1655/56 A.D in Miranpur. His father Makhdum Fazlullah provided his early education. He travelled the subcontinent to find a spiritual guide (murshid). He arrived in Burhanpur and became initiated into the Qadiriyya order. He travelled to Bijapur and from there to Delhi. In Burhanpur, he was a disciple of Shah Abdul Malik ibn Shah Ubaidullah Jilani Qadiri. When his learning was complete, he took leave from his murshid. Before his departure, Shah Abdul Malik placed four things before his disciple: a tasbeeh, a prayer mat, a karaa, and a sword. Shah Inayat chose the sword, to which his murshid asked: 'O fakir what price will you pay for this gift?' He replied: \\"The price is my head.\\" Influence Once back in Miranpur, Shah Inayat spent his days in meditation and prayer. His message was one of love, tolerance, and equality. Peasants left their respective lands to work for Shah Inayat as he had organized collective farming on his lands. He established a monastery (khangah) at Miranpur and distributed his land among the landless tillers (harees). He expressed opposition to the landlords (zamindar) as well as orthodox theologians. He attracted many followers among the peasantry, and organized them against the rulers, landlords and religious scholars, urging them not to pay agriculture tax to the rulers or give a share of their produce to the landlords. The landlords and orthodox mullahs then aligned against him and complained to Azam Khan, governor of Thatta Sarkar that Shah Inayat was trying to overthrow the government. Battle of Jhok Sufi Shah Inayat's rising influence among his followers in the area of lower Sindh (Thatta Sarkar) caused much discontent in Mian Yar Muhammad Kalhoro. The latter enjoyed political sway over Bakhar Sarkar (Northern Sindh) and Sehwan Sarkar (Central Sindh) and thus wanted to control over Thatta Sarkar which was still under the rule of Mughal Nawabs. Kalhoro, the first ruler of Kalhora dynasty, strove to consolidate his power across Sindh, but found the social movement of Sufi Shah Inayat a hurdle in realizing his ambition. Thus he, along with other influential landlords, and Pirs of Dargah succeeded in persuading the Delhi government to act against Shah Inayat and his followers for their rebellion against the Mughal Empire. A battle was launched on Farrukhsiyar's order with the combined forces of Kalhora Chief and the Mughal army of governor of Thatta. The Battle of Jhok was a clash between the Mughal forces along with their local rulers and a band of Sufis who chose to revolt against the feudal and imperial order of the day. A siege was laid to the town of Jhok for about four months, but Shah Inayat's followers gave a stiff resistance. Shah Inayat was preparing to attack the invaders on 1 January 1718 AD when the Kalhora chief sent Shahdad Khan Talpur with the Quran to invite Shah Inayat for peace talks. However, when Shah Inayat met Mian Yar Muhammad Kalhoro for talks, he was arrested, brought to Thatta and presented to the Mughal governor. Death Shah Inayat was questioned and beheaded a few days later on 7 January 1718. During his trial, Shah Inayat appeared to long for death and therefore is known as Hallaj of Sindh and is venerated as crowned head of Sufis. His last words to his executioner were in the following verses: \\"You have released me from the chains of existence, May Allah blesses you now and hereafter.\\" His head was taken to Delhi. On the betrayal of Mian Yaar Muhammad Kalhoro, Shah said following verse: \\"⁄èŸàŸÜ⁄Øÿ±Ÿä ⁄èŸÜŸä ⁄èÿß⁄ô⁄æŸäÿå ⁄™ŸàŸá ⁄™ÿ™Ÿä ÿ¨Ÿà Ÿæ⁄á.\\" (The oppressor had promised (by touching his beard), it [the beard] was just like the tale of a dog.) Two devotees of Shah Inayat Shaheed were present in Farrukhsiyar's court. When they saw what had happened, they blinded Farrukhsiyar with red hot irons. Chaos ensued and one of the disciples was killed while the other escaped with the head of his Shaheed Master and made it to Jhok. A Sayyid from Thatta built a shrine, where Shah Shaheed was buried. Thousands of his followers were buried in seven mass graves each known as 'Ganj-e-Shaheed'. A total of 24,000 followers were killed during this battle, which is comparable only to the Battle of Karbala.

Life The son of William Taylor (b. 1693), a versatile artisan, and the writer Ann Taylor (n√©e Cooke), he was born on 13 December 1730 in the parish of St. Michael in Bedwardine, in the city of Worcester. In the early part of his career he worked successively as a brassfounder, a silversmith, and a surveyor. About 1752 he made his way to London, and found employment first at a silversmith‚Äôs, and then with Thomas Jefferys the cartographer, at the corner of St Martin's Lane. Under his guidance he executed a number of plates for the Gentleman‚Äôs Magazine. Taylor moved on to book illustration, working on William Owen Pughe's Dictionary and Andrew Tooke's Pantheon. Soon after its incorporation, in January 1765, Taylor was admitted a fellow of the Society of Artists, and in 1774 he was appointed secretary as successor to John Hamilton, being the third to hold that post. At the time he joined the society Taylor was living at Holles Street, Clare Market. Taylor seems to have moved to the Bible and Crown, Holborn, about 1770, to Chancery Lane in 1773, and back to Holborn by 1776. When Thomas Bewick visited London in that year he received kind treatment from Taylor; when, however, after a short experience, Bewick decided that he would ‚Äòrather herd sheep at five shillings a week than be tied to live in London . . . my kind friend left me in a pet and I never saw him more‚Äô (Memoir, 1887, p. 105). Among Taylor's other personal friends were David Garrick, Oliver Goldsmith, Francesco Bartolozzi, Richard Smirke, and Henry Fuseli. Soon after 1780 Taylor retired to Edmonton, and painted a few subjects in oil. He died at Edmonton on 17 October 1807, aged 77, and was buried in Edmonton churchyard, where there was a monument to him. Works Taylor engraved for John Boydell A Flemish Collation, after Van Harp, which was shown at the first exhibition at Spring Gardens, and prefixed a vignette to John Langhorne's Poetical Works (1766), vignettes being then regarded as a virtual monopoly of the \\"library engravers\\" of France. Taylor designed and engraved the vignette to Oliver Goldsmith's The Deserted Village in 1770. He also designed and engraved plates for The Fool of Quality, a frontispiece to William Robertson's Charles V (1772), cuts for Sparrman‚Äôs ‚Äò Cape of Good Hope, Clavigero's Mexico, Chambers‚Äôs Cyclop√¶dia, and numerous other publications. Among his best-regarded engravings were those for his friend Samuel Richardson's novel Sir Charles Grandison, the plates for which he exhibited with the Society of Artists in 1778. \\"Not many plates\\", said Bewick, \\"have been superior to these\\", though \\"as designer\\", he adds, \\"he has in these attended too much to fashion and the change of mode\\". Portraits by Taylor include a pencil drawing of Cornelius Cayley (1773), Mrs. Abingdon as Lady Betty Modish (drawn and engraved), David Garrick in the character of a drunken sailor speaking the prologue to Britannia (1778), Garrick as Tancred (1776). Family Taylor married at Shenfield, Essex, on 9 May 1754, Sarah Hackshaw Jefferys (1733‚Äì1809), daughter of Josiah and niece of Thomas Jefferys, and had issue Charles Taylor (1756‚Äì1823); Isaac Taylor (1759‚Äì1829); Josiah (1761‚Äì1834), a publisher in Hatton Garden; Sarah (1763‚Äì1845), who married Daniel Hooper; and Ann (1765‚Äì1832), who married James Hinton, a clergyman, and was mother of John Howard Hinton. He brought up his two eldest sons as engravers. James Taylor (1745‚Äì1797), younger brother of Isaac, practised for many years as a china painter in the porcelain works at Worcester, but about 1771 came to London to work under his brother. He exhibited at the Incorporated Society between 1771 and 1775, and worked upon illustrations for magazines. Among his pupils was Anker Smith. James Taylor died in London on 21 December 1797. A son of James, who was for some time a singer at Vauxhall Gardens, was also an engraver.

Partly hidden behind ancient buildings on the village High Street, the simple brick chapel was erected in 1842 on the initiative of James Weller, a \\"somewhat remarkable man\\" whose preaching had attracted large audiences across Kent and East Sussex in the previous decade. The Strict Baptist cause was historically strong in East Sussex, and Protestant Nonconformism thrived in Robertsbridge, which was distant from the nearest Anglican parish church. The chapel closed in about 1999 and permission was granted for its conversion into a house. English Heritage has designated it a Grade II Listed building. History The ancient village of Salehurst, mentioned in the Domesday survey of 1086, had an extensive parish spanning the River Rother. There was no settlement at Robertsbridge, southwest of Salehurst village, until after 1210, when a Cistercian abbey founded in 1176 moved there from its site further up the valley. By the 14th century, Robertsbridge was by far the larger village. There was no place of worship serving the Established Church, though: a chapel associated with the abbey was last recorded in 1567 and was probably demolished soon afterwards, and the parish church remained in Salehurst. In 1676, when a religious census was taken, Salehurst parish was found to have the second highest number of Nonconformists (28) of any parish in the area: it was behind only Rye, whose Nonconformist population was increased by refugees from continental Europe. (In England, people and ministers who worshipped outside the Church of England but were not part of the Roman Catholic Church were historically known as Nonconformists or Dissenters. Nonconformism became officially recognised after the Act of Uniformity 1662.) Many Nonconformist denominations thrived in Sussex from the 17th century, some of which overlapped, merged and changed their ecclesiology over time. Calvinistic causes were particularly popular, especially in East Sussex. Belief in predestination and the salvation of a chosen group (the doctrine of limited atonement) were shared across all Calvinistic groups, but Strict Baptists also hold the view that communion is only to be taken by those who have become members of the Church through baptism. In 1809, Jacob Martell‚Äîa member of the Independent Calvinistic Cade Street Chapel near Heathfield‚Äîadopted these views and was ejected from that church. He moved to Burwash and founded a Strict Baptist chapel in 1810. Six years later, Shover's Green Baptist Chapel was established by former members of the Burwash congregation. Bethel Chapel's founder James Weller preached across Kent and Sussex, and converted the wife of the Mayor of Rye‚Äîwho founded this Strict Baptist chapel there. The chapel stands behind a shop on Robertsbridge High Street. James Weller came to Burwash in 1838 as a 31-year-old preacher who had been a prominent figure in the Strict Baptist cause in Kent throughout the 1830s. Born in Headcorn, he became a poor farmer and was baptised into the Church of England. In about 1828, during a serious illness, he experienced a spiritual conversion and adopted Calvinistic Baptist beliefs. He was re-baptised at King Street Chapel in Maidstone in 1831. Over the next few years, he preached regularly at chapels in Frittenden, Smarden, Headcorn and (from 1837) at the Shover's Green chapel. The following year, he went to its parent church at Burwash; his growing reputation meant he continued to visit chapels across East Sussex and Kent, where he drew large crowds. In his \\"curious little autobiography\\" called The Wonders of Free Grace, as Manifested in the Life of James Weller, Minister of the Gospel, Bethel Chapel, Robertsbridge (1844), Weller described his concerns at the running of the Burwash chapel, and in 1842 he had the opportunity to establish his own chapel when a friend, James Caffyn, offered him a house on the High Street in Robertsbridge which he could turn into a place of worship. This included a lease for 50 years and an annual maintenance fund of ¬£10. The first stone of the chapel, \\"half hidden behind a shop and a cottage\\", was laid on 1 November 1842. Weller officially left the chapel at Burwash in January 1843, and Bethel Strict Baptist Chapel opened on 17 January 1843. Weller noted that he preached to a very large congregation, but that he \\"was sorely tried the whole of the day with [his] own debts and those of the chapel\\". It was common in Sussex for chapels to be built for the benefit of particular preachers rather than because the local populace demanded one, and in the chapel's early years many members of the congregation were drawn from the chapel at Burwash rather than from Robertsbridge village. Bethel Chapel was constituted (officially formed into a church) in August 1844. Weller's ill health and debt problems continued, and he died in 1847. In his History of Salehurst, Leonard Hodson notes that while he was a \\"somewhat remarkable man\\", he was more of a \\"dreamer\\" than a practical man and his philosophy was that of a \\"mystical Micawber\\". Nevertheless, his preaching was influential: its effect on the wife of the Mayor of Rye caused a spiritual conversion which led to her becoming a Baptist and founding the Bethel Strict Baptist Chapel at Rye, which is still in use. George Stedman became the pastor at the Robertsbridge chapel in 1848 and continued until 1881; in 1864, during his pastorate, the chapel became aligned to the Gospel Standard Baptist movement. No other full-time pastor led the chapel after Stedman's death, and it declined in the early 20th century. There was a revival from 1940, when it was reconstituted and regular worship recommenced, and the congregation still met as late as 1996, but in October 1999 planning permission was granted to convert the chapel into a house. Bethel Chapel was listed at Grade II by English Heritage on 13 May 1987. Architecture and description High on the front elevation is a carved date stone. Bethel Chapel is \\"an excellent example of the unobtrusive good taste of the Strict Baptists' chapel style\\", and its \\"quaint\\" appearance contrasts with the \\"very Victorian\\", \\"rich and fruity\\" neighbouring Congregational Church of 1881. Weller's chapel was built in 1842, as indicated on the carved stone tablet placed high on the west-facing gable. This elevation is of red brick and has two wooden-framed windows with pointed arches containing -tracery. The sides of the building are hung with red tiles, and the roof has slate tiles. The entrance is set below a gabled hood mould. Inside, a memorial tablet set into one of the walls commemorated James Weller, who died on 12 September 1847. A Biblical quote, \\"Blessed are the dead who die in the Lord\\", concluded the epitaph. George Stedman, the second preacher (d. 2 January 1881), and Christopher Sharp (d. 25 January 1890), another man associated with the chapel's early history, were commemorated together on another stone. James Caffyn (d. 23 October 1894), who gave the site for the chapel, and his two daughters also had a monumental inscription; the children, who died in infancy, were buried in a grave nearby.

The University Centre is in the top 10 highest HE student numbers in FE in England. Blackpool and The Fylde College has the highest number of HE in FE student numbers. University Centre offers degrees, HNC/HNDs and postgraduate courses, each validated by the University of South Wales, the University of Central Lancashire or Lancaster University. History Formerly known as the East Lancashire Institute of Higher Education (ELIHE), the institution was formed in 1993 with the purchase of the old seven-floor former British Telecom building for ¬£2.5 million and formally named as the ELIHE in 2003. Each floor was given over to one of the various schools of education within the university structure but the condition of the building meant that a new location for the institute would have to be found by the late 2000s. Construction began on the new University Centre building near the main College campus in 2008 with a total investment cost of ¬£13 million, the work was completed for the start of the 2009 academic year in 2009 when the building was opened by local MP Jack Straw and the then manager of Blackburn Rovers Football Club, Sam Allardyce. In 2010, a further investment of ¬£500,000 saw the canteen area, known as the Curve, expanded to improve student study and social space after an increase in student numbers during the buildings second year of existence. In 2011, further expansion plans were revealed as University Centre looked to create places for a further 600 students. The planned extension will house facilities to focus on degree courses in sciences, technology, engineering and mathematics and would bring the total number of degree level students to almost 3,000. Also in 2011, the institute has begun the process of applying for the rights to validate its own degree programmes, The college applied to the Privy Council of the United Kingdom in 2011 for Foundation Degree Awarding Powers (FDAP), the decision of this application is expected in July 2016. The outcome of the FDAP application has been communicated to the governing body on 8 July, the FDAP application has been unsuccessful. The College are currently running degree courses that are validated externally by the University of Central Lancashire and Lancaster University University structure The University contains the following schools: * University Centre Business School * School of Arts, Humanities and Social Science * School of Law, Justice and Community Studies * School of Education and Professional Studies * School of Science and Technology Student life =Students' Union= The UCBC Students' Union has been active at the College since 2009 and during the final years of the ELIHE.

One third of the council was up for election and the Conservative party stayed in overall control of the council. After the election, the composition of the council was *Conservative 38 *Labour 17 *Liberal Democrat 4 Background Before the election the Conservatives controlled the council with 40 seats, compared to 15 for Labour and 4 for the Liberal Democrats. 20 of the 59 seats were being contested, with the winners only serving for one year as the 2012 election would see every seat being contested after boundary changes. Since the 2010 election Labour had gained Moredon in a by-election and had the independent, former Conservative, councillor Steve Wakefield of Toothill and Westlea ward join the party, both in November 2010. During the campaign both the national Labour leader Ed Miliband and the Labour Shadow Works and Pensions Secretary Liam Byrne visited Swindon to support the local party. Election result The results saw the Conservatives stay in control of the council with 38 seats, but lose 2 seats to Labour, who moved to 17 seats. Labour gained the seats of St Philip and Walcot from the Conservatives, while coming close in Eastcott against the Liberal Democrats and in Covingham and Nythe, Dorcan and Freshbrook and Grange Park, which were held by the Conservatives. The Labour victory in Walcot defeated the Conservative cabinet member Peter Mallinson, with the winning candidate Ellen Osa becoming the first female black councillor in Swindon. Overall turnout at the election was 38.26%, ranging from a high of 46.08% in Highworth to a low of 29.62% in Parks. The outgoing leader of the Labour group, Derique Montaut, said the results meant that \\"For Labour it builds us up to a situation where we are moving up to 2012 and taking control of the council\\". However the Conservative leader of the council, Ron Bluh, said that while \\"It obviously wasn't one of the better nights\\", the seats lost had been the \\"two most marginal seats\\" and \\"so there's no great surprise\\".

In 1925, the South African Railways placed a single experimental Class FC Modified Fairlie articulated steam locomotive with a 2-6-2+2-6-2 Double Prairie type wheel arrangement in service.Espitalier, T.J.; Day, W.A.J. (1945). The Locomotive in South Africa - A Brief History of Railway Development. Chapter VII - South African Railways (Continued). South African Railways and Harbours Magazine, December 1945. pp. 967-968. Manufacturer To obtain experience with another type of articulated locomotive similar to the Garratt design, Colonel F.R. Collins DSO, Chief Mechanical Engineer of the South African Railways (SAR), was authorised to experiment with a modified type of Fairlie locomotive. The sole experimental Class FC Double Prairie type Modified Fairlie locomotive was designed and built for the SAR by the North British Locomotive Company in 1924. It was numbered 2310 upon delivery during February 1925, but it was later renumbered to 670.North British Locomotive Company works list, compiled by Austrian locomotive historian Bernhard Schmeiser The Fairlie locomotive The Fairlie locomotive was invented and patented in 1864 by the Scottish engineer Robert Francis Fairlie. =Double Fairlie= Cape Government Railways Double Fairlie, c. 1888 The first Fairlie locomotives later became known as Double Fairlies. In general appearance, most of them were reminiscent of the German-built Zwillinge which saw service on the narrow gauge lines in German South West Africa and other German territories. However, while the Zwillinge were pairs of individual locomotives which were semi-permanently coupled back-to-back, the Double Fairlie was a single locomotive with either a double-ended boiler or two separate boilers with smokeboxes at each end, a central firebox and a central cab, all mounted on one rigid frame. It ran on two swiveling engine units or powered bogies similar to those of a Garratt locomotive, with the cylinders on each engine unit at the respective locomotive ends. Couplers, buffers and, where they were in use, cowcatchers were mounted on the engine units so that they could more accurately follow the curvature of the track. =Single Fairlie= A variation of the Fairlie concept was the Single Fairlie, also known as the Mason Fairlie. The Single Fairlie design was essentially half a Double Fairlie. It retained the ability to negotiate sharp curves and while it abandoned the bidirectional nature of the Double Fairlie, it regained the ability of conventional locomotives to have a large water and coal bunker behind the cab and to use a trailing tender if necessary. Swindon Marlborough & Andover Railway Single Fairlie, c. 1878 Early Single Fairlies were similar in appearance to regular tank loco¬≠mo¬≠tives. The whole engine and bunker or tender combination was mounted on a single rigid frame as on the conven¬≠tional tank engine, but it differed by virtue of the fact that a pivoting engine unit was mounted under the boiler and an unpowered bogie under the bunker or tender. Mason Bogie Single Fairlie, c. 1874 Later models were similar in appearance to conven¬≠tional tender locomotives. It was developed by William Mason in the United States of America, where the type became known as the Mason Bogie. It had one boiler, a cab and bunker at one end, a single engine unit or powered bogie under the boiler and an unpowered bogie under the cab and bunker. The illustration shows a Mason Bogie with an 0-6-6 wheel arrangement. =Modified Fairlie= The first Modified Fairlie was introduced in South Africa and was viewed as a competitor and alternative to the Garratt type. Colonel Collins displayed a distinct preference for articulated locomotives and the Modified Fairlie was acquired as an experimental locomotive in 1925 to compare its concept to that of the Garratt locomotive in terms of actual performance and maintenance requirements. The Class FC Modified Fairlie was, in essence, an adaptation of the Kitson-Meyer concept. It was similar in appearance to a Garratt, but with the boiler, cab, coal and water bunkers all mounted on a single rigid frame which extended almost over the full length of the locomotive. This superstructure was supported on two engine units by means of pivots. The pivot centres were located approximately at the centre of the coupled wheelbase of each engine unit. In the Garratt design, by comparison, the coal and water bunkers are mounted directly on the engine units and pivot with them, while the boiler, firebox and cab are mounted on a rigid cradle frame which is suspended between the two engine units. On the Modified Fairlie, as compared to the Double Fairlie, the distance between the engine units had been increased to a figure similar to that of the Garratt type, thereby allowing space between them for a liberal firebox and ashpan. This resulted in a more efficient boiler and also distributed the weight of the engine over a greater length than was obtainable with an orthodox Double Fairlie design. It was claimed that the Modified Fairlie arrangement reduced the wear between wheel flanges and rails and that the distribution of the loads on the axles as fuel and water was expended was less variable than could be obtained with the Garratt design. Characteristics The superheated Class FC had diameter piston valves actuated by Walschaerts valve gear, and a thick plate frame. The aim with the experimental locomotive was to compare the performance and maintenance requirements of the Modified Fairlie to that of a Garratt, in particular to the Class GC Double Prairie type Garratt which was similar in both size and mechanical respects. Hence, also, the experimental Modified Fairlie's Class FC designation, skipping the FA and FB classifications which were never used by the SAR. Service The locomotive was placed in service on the Cape Midlands System. While it gave good service, it was not outstanding and proved to be not as successful as the Garratt. The frame resulted in severe overhang on sharp curves. The heavily laden overhangs beyond the pivots also led to metal fatigue due to its tendency to oscillate up-and-down. The pivot bearings were also subject to quite rapid wear, since they carried a considerable additional load compared to those on the Garratt as a result of the water and coal bunkers which were mounted on the long main frame instead of on the engine units. These factors resulted in increased frequency of maintenance and, as a consequence, increased operating cost. No more of the Class FC locomotive was ordered. The sole locomotive was scrapped in 1939, after a comparatively short service life of only fourteen years.

Touring extensively they have supported several bands such as Frank Turner, Dropkick Murphys, Streetlight Manifesto, Strung Out, The Reverend Peyton's Big Damn Band and Trampled By Turtles as well as embarking on full Canadian and American tours by themselves. Since shifting to acoustic instruments busking has also been a part of their tours stating in an interview, \\"We play a lot of street corners if we are low on gas money.\\" They have played at various festivals; the largest to date being the 2011 Vans Warped Tour, with Alternative Press putting them on their 10 Must See Under- The-Radar Warped Tour Acts list. History Brothers Jamin and Jesse Marshall formed the group in 2003 beginning as a 3-piece punk rock band with Greg Johnson. The name Larry and His Flask comes from a fictional character created by Jamin Marshall around the time of the formation of the band. With Jesse Marshall playing electric bass at the time and Jamin Marshall on drums Greg Johnson played electric guitar and were soon joined by Ian Cook who played lead guitar. The next addition was another long-time friend Beau Batts replacing Jamin on drums bringing him to the front as lead vocalist. According to the band they, \\"spent its first half-decade stuck in a primordial, punk- rock goop\\" where the goal was always \\"party over perfection.\\" During this time a number of albums were self-released with different line ups. The most consistent at that point being Jamin Marshall (vocals), Jesse Marshall (bass), Ian Cook (lead guitar), Beau Batts (drums) and Brian Martin (rhythm guitar) from 2005‚Äì2007. In this time The Lost Seamen and We're Going Dancin' Tonight were released and short tours around the surrounding states with another local band, Zombie Co-Pilot, were commonplace. Brian Martin then left, leaving Ian as the sole guitarist. Continuing as a quartet, they continued to tour, also playing a date at the 2007 Vans Warped Tour. The next full-length release was Never Long Gone! in mid-2008, with their first full Canadian tour. However, not long after arriving back home, Beau Batts also left the band. In late 2008, the band radically changed its sound. They switched to acoustic instruments and guitarist Ian Cook took over lead vocals, moving original vocalist Jamin Marshall back to drums. While changing the dynamic within the remaining members, guitarist Dallin Bulkley as well as mandolinist Kirk Skatvold and banjoist Andrew Carew from the now defunct Zombie Co-Pilot were recruited, as well as others from more local bands, adding multi-part harmonies to its punk rock roots to round out the new sound. It was at this point that LAHF (Larry and His Flask) grew to 11 members for a short time with the addition of an accordion, fiddle, and cello among other instruments before coming to the 6 that are now the current members. The band's first full-length since this stylistic change, '[All That We Know, was released by Silver Sprocket Bicycle Club in July 2011. Larry and His Flask performed on the entire 2011 Vans Warped Tour and toured in support of Streetlight Manifesto in 2011. \\"The Flask\\" is set to tour with Pentimento recording artist Lionize from September through November 2011. After appearing on the final leg of the 2012 Warped Tour, Larry and his Flask toured with international recording artist Frank Turner on his 2012 US tour and his 2013 UK tour. In June 2014, while on tour, they had their van and equipment totaling $24,000 stolen in Cayce, SC.

It is about long and flows through the district Bogenhausen in Munich. It is a right tributary of the Isar. Course The present-day Brunnbach has its source in the bank of the Isar in the former Montgelas Garden in today's Herzogpark area of Bogenhausen. At its beginning, the river crosses several private grounds and partly flows in pipes. A public lawn follows at the Brunnbachleite. After the inn \\"Wirtshaus im Gr√ºntal\\" that was closed 2001, the stream runs through private grounds, then follows the (a canal) in straight line, flows through the aera of the district of the Bogenhausen district and flows after about through a sewer pipe under the Mittlere-Isar-Kanal. On the isle of the Isar in Oberf√∂hring, it supplies a pond by means of a pumping station in the landmarked \\"Pumpenw√§rterh√§uschen\\" (house of pumping engineer). The majority of its water reaches the surface at the north of the St. Emmeram bridge from a stone mouth designed as foutain, and then flows into the Isar in two arms. History Until the end of the 19th century, the Brunnbach's source was near Bad Brunnthal in the lower Bogenhausen and, like today, reaches the Isar river at St. Emmeram. From the 10th to the 19th century, in Gr√ºntal and St. Emmeram the Brunnbach powered four mills. At the time the Herzogpark was covered with buildings the Brunnbach was filled up north of the street Montgela√üstra√üe. The former upper course in the park is now a river of its own called Brunnthaler Quellbach. Because of its purity, the water was regarded as curative water. In the 17th century, Brunnthal became a well-known spa, and its operation was continued until 1914. Even today, the springs of Brunnbach have drinking water quality. In the course of the uncoverage of the Munich rivers, a renaturation of the Brunnbach was also discussed in the 1990s. Not earlier than 10 years later, the section between the Abacostra√üe and the Opitzstra√üe was relocated into a new bed within the municipal green area. The Brunnbach served Thomas Mann as a model for the river in his novella A Man and His Dog (Herr und Hund).

The work on the dragon design had been started on the head before the project was abandoned The Yangshan Quarry () is an ancient stone quarry near Nanjing, China. Used during many centuries as a source of stone for buildings and monuments of Nanjing, it is preserved as a historic site. The quarry is famous for the gigantic unfinished stele that was abandoned there during the reign of the Yongle Emperor in the early 15th century. In scope and ambition, the stele project is compared to other public works projects of Yongle era, which included the launching of the treasure fleet for Zheng He's maritime expeditions and the construction of the Forbidden City in Beijing.Louise Levathes, When China Ruled the Seas: Treasure Fleets of the Dragon Throne. Caption to the picture between pp. 128-129. Location The stele base, partly separated from the body of the mountain The Yangshan Quarry is situated on the Yangshan Mountain (elevation 140 m), also known as Yanmen Shan (), northwest of Tangshan Town (). The Yangshan is the main peak of the Kongshan Mountain Range (). The site is located 15‚Äì20 km to the east from the eastern part of Nanjing City Wall and the Ming Xiaoling Mausoleum.As per Google Maps. Administratively, the area is in the Jiangning District of Nanjing City, Jiangsu Province. History Under the stele body, mostly separated from the rock under it The stele base, with a hiker next to it for scale The Yangshan Quarry has been worked from the time of the Six Dynasties, the local limestone being used for construction of buildings, walls, and statues in and around Nanjing. After Zhu Yuanzhang (the Hongwu Emperor) founded the Ming dynasty in 1368, the city of Nanjing became the capital city of his empire. The Yangshan quarry became the main source of stone for the major construction projects that changed the face of Nanjing. In 1405, Hongwu's son, the Yongle Emperor, ordered the cutting of a giant stele in this quarry, for use in the Ming Xiaoling Mausoleum of his deceased father. In accordance with the usual design of a Chinese memorial stele, three separate pieces were being cut: the rectangular stele base (pedestal), the stele body, and the stele head (crown, to be decorated with a dragon design). After most of the stone-cutting work had been done, the architects realized that moving stones that big from Yangshan to Ming Xiaoling, let alone installing them there in a proper way, would not be physically possible. As a result, the project was abandoned. In place of the stele, a much smaller tablet (still, the largest in the Nanjing area), known as the Shengong Shengde (\\"Divine Merits and Godly Virtues\\") Stele was installed in Ming Xiaoling's \\"Square Pavilion\\" (Sifangcheng) in 1413. The three unfinished stele components remain in Yangshan Quarry to this day, only partially separated from the solid rock of the mountain. The present dimensions and the usual weight estimates of the steles are as follows: * The Stele Base (), 30.35 m long, 13 m thick, 16 m tall, 16,250 metric tons.See e.g. YANGSHAN TABLET - THE FIRST TABLET IN THE WORLD / Èò≥Â±±Á¢ëÊùêÂ§©‰∏ãÁ¨¨‰∏ÄÁ¢ë for the commonly given weight estimates. Their sizes are slightly different from those in Yang and Lu, which is not surprising, since the stone monoliths, after all, are not completely separated from the solid rock below. * The Stele Body (), 49.4 m long (this would be the height, if the stele were to be properly installed), 10.7 m wide, 4.4 m thick, 8,799 tons. * The Stele Head (), 10.7 m tall, 20.3 m wide, 8.4 m thick, 6,118 tons. According to experts, if the stele had been finished and put together, by installing the stele body vertically on the base, and topping with the stele head, then it would have stood 73 meters tall. For comparison, the Shengong Shengde Stele actually installed in Ming Xiaoling is 8.78 m tall (6.7 m body + crown, on top of a 2.8 m tall tortoise pedestal). The Song-dynasty (early 12th century) Wan Ren Chou (\\"Ten Thousand Men's Sorrow\\") Stele in Qufu, which is thought to be one of the tallest in China, is 16.95 m tall, 3.75 m wide, 1.14 m thick.Â±±‰∏ú‰πãÊúÄ (Shandong's \\"Firsts\\")Pauline D Loh, \\" Sons of the Yellow Emperor\\". 2011-07-31, China Daily.

In memory of the workers who died on the construction site‚Äîincluding those who died from overwork and disease‚Äîa nearby village became known as Fentou (), or \\"Grave Mound\\". Ann Paludan translates the place name as \\"Death's Head Valley\\". In the centuries since the giant stele project was abandoned, a number of Ming, Qing, and modern authors visited the site and left accounts of it. The poet Yuan Mei (1716 ‚Äì 1797) expressed his feelings in \\"The Song of Hongwu's Great Stone Tablet\\" (), which concludes with \\"one hundred thousand camels could not move it!\\" (\\"\\"). The poem is published in his collection Xiao Cangshan Fang Wenji (). Present day Performance at the Ming Culture Village In 1956, the Yangshan Quarry was entered on the Jiangsu provincial register of protected cultural monuments. It is maintained as a tourist site, although, according to journalists who visited it at the turn of the 21st century, the site was little known even in Nanjing itself, and had few visitors. A small theme park called the Ming Culture Village (, M√≠ng W√©nhu√† C≈´n) was constructed at the entrance to the site; as of 2011, it has a stage, children's rides, and various history-themed amusements. A single admission ticket allows one to visit the \\"village\\" and then to walk some 300‚Äì400 m to the quarry proper on one of several forest trails. The site is open year- round, but still is mostly deserted in winter. Transportation from Nanjing to the Yangshan Quarry (either directly to the Ming Culture Village's entrance plaza, or to the \\"Yangshan Quarry\\" stop on the Jiangsu Provincial Highway 122 (S122)) is provided by several bus routes, including the Nanjing-Tangshan Line (, N√°n-TƒÅng Xi√†n) from the Nanjing Railway Station.ÂçïËΩ¶Ê∏∏Âçó‰∫¨‰πãÈò≥Â±±Á¢ëÊùê (By bike to Nanjing's Yangshan Quarry), 2011-04-16A 2011 Nanjing Public Transport Map Notes Literature Category:Quarries Category:Surface mines in China Category:Ming dynasty Category:History of Nanjing Category:Buildings and structures in Nanjing Category:Monoliths Category:Tourist attractions in Nanjing ","title":"Yangshan Quarry"},{"id":"33045452","text":"Bubesheimer Bach is a small river of Bavaria, Germany.

The first ensued when Conigliaro swung at a dropped third strike. The slugger ran to first base, but Anthony called him out per baseball rules, as there was already a runner occupying first base. In the 19th inning, Conigliaro was called out on strikes while attempting to bunt. Conigliaro tossed his helmet in the air and hit it with his bat.

In 2020, Meeco is going to release his fifth album WE OUT HERE which will feature boom bap sound.  Biography  As a young child, Meeco was heavily influenced by his father who played classical piano, making it natural to follow in his progenitor‚Äôs footsteps. Meeco began lessons at six years old, and after several years of studying classical music, he sought other musical outlets. After a friend introduced vintage Ella Fitzgerald, Horace Silver and McCoy Tyner recordings, Meeco became enamored with jazz music. Highly inspired and motivated, he attempted to imitate the sounds he heard on the records, but found he needed more experience with jazz music. He sought piano and theoretical study with the first of his mentors, pianist and producer Marco Meister (producer of German electro group Terranova (band)). With Meister, Meeco gained musical skills and invaluable studio experience in producing his own music. Meeco met his second mentor, New York pianist/singer Bob Lenox quite by accident. Lenox, who at the time was working in Berlin, Germany as a staff writer for Warner Bros. Records and performing with artists such as Esther Phillips, Pee Wee Ellis, Garland Jefferies and others, became a teacher and close friend. It was through Bob Lenox that Meeco came to the conclusion that the only important thing in music, whether composition or pianistic skill, was creating the right ‚Äúfeeling‚Äù. It was with the knowledge gained by these two mentors, that Meeco quickly gained a reputation as producer for some of Berlin‚Äôs finest working musicians. Meeco's music has been described as \\"impressionistic\\", \\"romantic\\" as well as \\"fragile and introspective\\".

This would give Fairbanks a chance to show his physical prowess cinematically and loosen the play from what would be stage bound constraints. Griffith also altered characters; Fairbanks' character's name is changed to Gerald, with his parent being his mother (Kate Toncray), whereas in the play his character was named Nick with his parent being his father played by Crane.

It can be found in water bodies such as the Yangtze Basin, Pearl River, Amur River, and various other drainages. There are several known invasive populations in places such as Barcelona, the San Joaquin River in California, and the majority of Japan. The large-scale loach is typically brown, grey, or golden in color with mottled or speckled black dots, which leads to it sometimes called a \\"peppered loach\\" when sold at pet stores (though it is more often misidentified as the pond loach instead). It is a small loach, growing between 7.3 to 15.4 cm (2.9 to 6.1 in) TL. The diet and behaviors of the large-scaled loach are just about the same as other true loaches. This loach is an omnivorous scavenging bottom feeder, and is equipped with three pairs of barbels used to detect edible items. They are able to breathe atmospheric oxygen, which allows it to survive in poor quality water or even on land for extended periods of time. Females develop eggs over the winter and reproduction occurs during the spring. The male wraps around the female in order to fertilize the eggs, which are laid in cover such as aquatic vegetation with no further parental care provided. The pond loach (Misgurnus anguillicaudatus) is a closely related species that the large-scale loach is often misidentified as. Note the black spot on the base of the tail fin, which is a feature the large-scale loach lacks. The large-scale loach looks very similar to another species of true loach, the pond loach (Misgurnus anguillicaudatus), so it is possible that invasive populations of the pond loach might actually consist either partially or entirely of large-scale loaches. The large-scale loach can be told apart from the pond loach by the presence of higher adipose crests on the caudal peduncle, a thinner lamina circularis (enlarged bony scale at the base of the first and second pectoral fin ray), and the lack of a dark spot near the caudal base in the upper corner on the tail fin. The large-scale loach also grows to a smaller size than the pond loach, which reaches 30 cm (12 in) TL. Both species are able to hybridize together, so identification may be difficult in mixed populations.

They have four studio albums, two of which were released on Facedown Records and Strike First (the imprint label of Facedown Records). Throughout their career, A Hope for Home has controlled many of the aspects of their music including recording, production, mixing, art direction, and art design. These commitments have allowed them to achieve the precise sound and imagery of their intentions, and have become part of the band's dynamic. History Founded in 2006 by friends Kyle Cooke and Matthew Ellis, \\"A Hope for Home\\" was a project devised by Cooke after discovering that his cancer had returned and was terminal. After a long struggle with cancer, founding member Kyle Cooke died on August 5, 2006. After his death, friends and family members of Cooke created the \\"Kyle Cooke Foundation\\", a \\"non-profit fundraising corporation that raises money for The Friends of Doernbecher Foundation and the people of the Camas and Washougal community on a need by need basis\\". Kyle Cooke playing at the Noisebox in 2006 On their website is a post stating the following: A Hope for Home has since continued with new members, while still bearing the name created by Kyle Cooke as a remembrance of their formation. In 2007, A Hope for Home entered the home studio of bassist Dan McCall (Robots Ate My Studio) and recorded their first album Here, the End. The track \\"Kyle\\" off of the album was written for Kyle Cooke by Matthew Ellis, and in the linear notes of the album there are words stating that the entire album is dedicated to the memory of Kyle Cooke. After releasing Here, the End in 2007, A Hope for Home gained local praise and began building their fan base by playing routinely at local venues such as The Noisebox in Camas, Wa and the Satyricon nightclub in Portland, OR. After several months of touring for Here, the End, A Hope for Home re-entered the studio to begin recording their next album. On December 4, 2008 the band announced via their Purevolume page that they had signed to Strike First Records (the imprint label for Facedown Records). \\"After 2 years of being a 100% DIY group we have finally been given an awesome chance to take the next step in the industry, and we can't be more excited\\". The Everlasting Man was released on January 20, 2009 on Strike First Records. The title of the album is taken from the G. K. Chesterton nonfiction work of the same name. The Everlasting Man added more atmospheric textures to their sound, using many different guitar effects and tones woven together with electronic backgrounds while still holding a strong drum and bass foundation. In an interview with Indie Vision Music, Keyboardist Eric Gerrard explained that \\"We wanted to sing about and affirm value in things that aren't often talked about in the current scene today\\" and that \\"a lot of our ideas lined up with what Chesterton talks about in the book (The Everlasting Man)\\". In September 2009 after several months of touring A Hope for Home announced that drummer Ian Vidovic would be leaving the band to pursue his other musical projects \\"Roads\\" and international touring with \\"The New Divide\\". After the departure of Vidovic, A Hope for Home entered a practice space in Beaverton, Oregon (recruiting the help of fellow drummer Lance Taylor) and began writing Realis, their third album to date. Throughout January 2010 A Hope for Home recorded at the \\"Red Room Studios\\" in Seattle, Washington and \\"Robots Ate My Studio\\" in Camas, WA. The album was produced by bassist Dan McCall, mastered by Troy Glessner at \\"Spectre Mastering\\", and featured art direction and design by guitarist Tanner Morita. Realis, a concept album about the search for meaning in a seemingly meaningless world, was a drastic change in the band's musical style. Far from the \\"breakdowns\\", \\"dance parts\\", and \\"double bass\\" of their previous records, Realis brought song structures and instrumentation that clearly indicated their Post and Sludge metal influences (Envy, Cult Of Luna, Isis). The album was well received by many music review sites (Absolute Punk, The New Review, Indie Vision Music). On September 10, 2011 the band announced via their Facebook page that they had finished their fourth official album titled \\"In Abstraction\\", and that it is set to be released on December 6, 2011 on Facedown Records. On November 25, 2011 the band played a cd release show for In Abstraction at the local Portland, OR Rotture-Branx venue complex along with local artists Tribes, Tiny Dads, Amos Val, My Mantle, and Kye Kye.  Genre and influences  Often described as Post-hardcore, A Hope for Home covers many other genres including Sludge metal, Post-rock, Post-metal, Alternative, and Experimental rock. With their debut album Here, The End, some of the band's more Metalcore and Melodic hardcore influences can be heard. After the release of The Everlasting Man, the band developed a far more atmospheric and electric sound. The band's third album, Realis, defined a significant change in the bands direction towards their Sludge metal and Post- metal influences. Perhaps one of the best examples of this is the guitar riff heard at 3:06 on the song \\"The Machine Stops\\", which gives a direct indication of Panopticon era Isis. A Hope for Home has a wide variety of influences, the following are some that have been mentioned by the band. Cult of Luna, Isis, Envy, Thrice, This Will Destroy You, Sigur R√≥s, Mono, Thursday, Underoath, Death Cab for Cutie. On the subject of the band's influences, Keyboardist Eric Gerrard stated \\"bands like those that aren't limited to one genre and continue to grow throughout their careers\\".

New Zealand is given a period of time to review the recommendations and can choose to either accept and implement them accordingly or explain why it does not accept them. The main goal of the UPR is to maintain and improve the domestic human rights situation in United Nations countries. The UPR process provides the opportunity for UN countries as well as NGO‚Äôs, other relevant UN bodies and individuals to raise concerns regarding the human rights situations in the country under review. The process allows the sharing of ideas and practices on how to best ensure that human rights obligations are complied with. It also allows governments to reflect on their own human rights situations and the public to offer their own views and feedback. Anyone who is interested in the UPR process can participate. This can include: *Iwi and other Maori groups. *NGO‚Äôs. *Human rights defenders. *Trade unions. *Community groups, churches and charities. *Local government. *Academic institutions. *National human rights institutions, such as the NZHRC. New Zealand‚Äôs Review In September 2008, the HRC selected Italy, Mauritius and the Philippines to form the troika. A list of questions was prepared by Argentina, Denmark, Hungary, Germany, the Netherlands, Sweden, the Czech Republic and the United Kingdom of Great Britain and Northern Ireland; and presented to NZ for consideration. The majority of questions focused on the social inequities (health, housing, employment, education, social services and criminal justice) faced by the indigenous people of New Zealand (NZ) (MƒÅori); the high level of domestic violence against women and children; and why the Treaty of Waitangi is not given greater constitutional recognition and protection. In January 2014, the HRC selected Cote d‚ÄôIvoire, Japan and the Russian Federation to form the troika. A list of questions was prepared by the Czech Republic, Germany, Liechtenstein, Mexico, the Netherlands, Slovenia, Spain and the United Kingdom of Great Britain and Northern Ireland. As in 2008, the focus of the questions remained on the reduction of the high level of domestic violence against women and children; the rights of the indigenous people and the social inequities faced by them as outlined above. In addition, the questions focused on the measures taken by the New Zealand Government to eliminate child poverty. The three reports of the 1st and 2nd cycle of the UPR comment on the following areas: scope of international obligations, NZ‚Äôs constitutional and legislative framework, NZ‚Äôs institutional and human rights infrastructure, and the promotion and protection of human rights. This last category examines specifically: *Areas of equality and non-discrimination regarding MƒÅori, women, persons with disabilities, senior citizens and sexual orientation; *Right to life, liberty and security of the person; *Right to freedom of expression; *Freedom of religion or belief; *Administration of justice and the rule of law; *Right to participate in political and public life; *Right to work and to just and favourable working conditions; *Right to social security & to an adequate standard of living; *Right to health; *Right to education and to participate in the cultural life of the community; *Rights of indigenous peoples; *Migrants, refugees and asylum seekers; and *Human Rights and counter-terrorism. National Report In 2008 the NZ Ministry of Foreign Affairs and Trade (MFAT) engaged in a consultation process with relevant stakeholders. In August 2008, MFAT held meetings with over 70 civil society organisations and NGOs. Following ministerial and departmental consultation, a draft report was released to the public in February 2009 for comment, after which the report was finalised. The 20-page report noted that NZ is party to seven of the nine ‚Äòcore‚Äô human right treaties. NZ has two primary human rights enactments: the New Zealand Bill of Rights Act 1990 (NZBORA) which affirms, protects and promotes fundamental rights and freedoms in NZ; and the New Zealand Human Rights Act 1993 which prohibits discrimination. NZ also has a varied human rights infrastructure; including the Office of the Ombudsman, the Health and Disability Commissioner and New Zealand Human Rights Commission (NZHRC); a National human rights institutions(sic) (NHRI) with an ‚ÄòA‚Äô status accreditation. The report concluded with seven key priorities for future action of the NZ Government. #Improving the economic, social and cultural wellbeing of people in New Zealand; #Reducing violence within families and its impact on women and children; #Improving the opportunities and responsibilities of young people in New Zealand through the education and youth justice systems; #Strengthening the rights of victims of crime; #Improving the consultation process with civil society for future human rights reporting and follow-up recommendations; #Strengthening the partnership between the Government and MƒÅori by continuing to support MƒÅori to realise their potential and continuing the momentum on achieving fair, just and practical settlements of historical claims under the Treaty of Waitangi; and #The implementation of the Convention on the Rights of Persons with Disabilities (CRPD) and the New Zealand Disability Strategy. The report also addressed the human rights situation of Tokelau. New Zealand is responsible for the fulfillment of obligations contained in treaties that are extended to Tokelau. Constitutional relationships are also maintained with the governments of the Cook Islands and Niue. The governments are consulted during the UPR process and are given the opportunity to comment on the draft report. The consultation process for New Zealand‚Äôs 2nd national UPR report was managed by MFAT in collaboration with other government agencies including the Ministry of Justice, Te Puni Kokiri and the NZHRC. In April 2013, public consultation meetings were held in six centres across New Zealand. The meetings were attended by a broad range of civil society organisations and NGO‚Äôs, iwi (Maori tribe/s) and individuals who raised specific human rights issues. The draft report acknowledged the issues raised and was released for public comment in August 2013. Relevant stakeholders including the governments of the Cook Islands, Niue and Tokelau were invited to comment on the draft report. The 20-page report was finalized in October 2013 and submitted to the UN in November 2013. The report addressed the improvements made following the acceptance of the 56 recommendations in 2009 by way of sub-headings. Six key priorities for future action were listed. #Strengthening the partnership between Government and Maori by continuing to support Maori to realise their potential and continuing the momentum on achieving fair, just and durable settlements of historical claims under the Treaty of Waitangi; #Improving the protection of children against abuse and neglect; #Reducing violence within families and its impact on women and children; #The ongoing implementation of CRPD (including accession to the Optional Protocol and the New Zealand Disability Strategy); #Advancing the Constitutional Review process; and #Ensuring any human rights impacts of the Canterbury earthquakes are accounted for in the ongoing decisions around the rebuild. Stakeholder and Compilation Reports In 2008, stakeholder submissions were made by the NZHRC, and the remaining 14 submissions were from NGOs and civil society organisations. The compilation report contains information gathered from the reports of other UN treaty bodies, special procedures, and any other relevant official UN documents. Both reports echoed the concerns found in the delegate questions to NZ and those acknowledged in the national report. In addition it was suggested that the Waitangi Tribunal recommendations should be made binding; concern was expressed at NZ‚Äôs vote against the Declaration on the Rights of Indigenous Peoples (DRIP); and repeal of the Foreshore and Seabed Act 2004, which extinguished any MƒÅori customary territorial title to the foreshore or seabed in NZ, was urged. The repeal of section 59 of the Crimes Act 1961 (which had provided a defence of reasonable force for parents who physically discipline their children) was welcomed, but unease was expressed about plans for a referendum on the issue. There was concern regarding the systemic gender pay gap; the alarmingly high child poverty rates; and the proposed amendments to the Terrorism Suppression Act 2002, which may result in unwarranted intrusion into the rights to freedom of association and expression. Also the 2007 New Zealand anti-terror raids and the treatment MƒÅori received during them. In addition to making submissions, stakeholders may also participate in other ways, including: *Commenting on New Zealand‚Äôs draft report when it is released. *Lobbying the Working Group of countries reviewing New Zealand‚Äôs report. *Making presentations to the UNHRC when the report is being adopted. *Monitoring and participating in New Zealand‚Äôs implementation of UPR recommendations. In 2013, 54 stakeholder submissions were made. These included a submission from the NZHRC, and the remaining 53 submissions were from NGO‚Äôs and civil society organisations. As in 2008, both reports addressed those issues referred to in the delegate questions to NZ and acknowledged in the national report. Concern was expressed regarding the rights of the indigenous people of NZ; it was suggested that NZ should adopt the Special Rapporteur‚Äôs recommendation of 2011 that the principles enshrined in the Treaty of Waitangi should be safeguarded within the domestic legal system; entrenchment of the Treaty as a constitutional norm was emphasised. As in 2008, concern was raised about Operation 8 (anti-terrorism raids carried out on 15 October 2007), which allegedly used excessive use of force against Maori Communities; it was recommended that NZ ensure that the Terrorism Suppression Amendment Act 2007 is not applied in a discriminatory manner. In addition, gender equality and domestic violence against women and children remained prominent issues. The impact of the Canterbury earthquakes was also addressed; regarding the political rights of the Christchurch community to engage in decision making; the right to an adequate standard of living; and the rights of the disabled to access buildings. Working Group Review The Working Group review of the 1st cycle of the UPR was held on the 7th of May 2009. The NZ delegation comprised 11 members and was led by Justice Minister Simon Powel. It included representatives of the Ministry of Justice, the Crown Law Office, the Department of Labour, the Department of Corrections, the Ministry of Foreign Affairs and Trade and the Permanent Mission of New Zealand to the United Nations Office at Geneva. Following the presentation by NZ of its report, the 36 delegates (from other State Members) entered into an interactive dialogue with NZ. Individual member states could ask questions and make recommendations, though NZ was under no obligation to accept any of the recommendations. Statements were made referring to positive achievements by NZ: accession to most international human rights instruments; efforts to protect and uphold the rights of the MƒÅori population and economic and social improvements for MƒÅori and Pacific peoples to combat discrimination, to enhance the rights of the child; advancements in the area of women‚Äôs rights and gender parity; the State‚Äôs Domestic Violence immigration policy, Taskforce for Action on Sexual Violence and the establishment of Family Courts; the active role of New Zealand in promoting the rights of persons with disabilities; the standing invitation extended to UN Special Procedures; the comprehensive scheme of social security and social safety nets; the New Zealand Bill of Rights Act and the Human Rights Act; policies to reduce poverty and to improve access to primary health; and the establishment of the NZHRC. Statements of concern were expressed relating to the issues identified in the reports mentioned above. NZ was given an opportunity to respond to these statements, and mention strategies being introduced to combat these issues. The working Group Review of the 2nd UPR was held on the 27th of January 2014. The NZ delegation comprised 9 members and was led by Hon Judith Collins, Minister of Justice, Minister for Accident Compensation Corporation (ACC) and Minister for Ethnic Affairs. Following the presentation of the national report, the 76 delegates (from other State Members) entered into an interactive dialogue with NZ. Discussion referring to the improvements made by NZ following the 1st cycle of the UPR in 2009 was made; in 2010 NZ had moved to support the DRIP and in 2011 had ratified the Optional Protocol on the Rights of the Child on the sale of Children, Child Prostitution, and Child Pornography; the Ministry of Social Development launched a White Paper for Vulnerable Children and the Children‚Äôs Action Plan focusing on children who are at risk of being abused or neglected; in May 2013 the Parliament had eliminated an area of discrimination with the Marriage Amendment Act 2013, which allowed for marriage between any two people regardless of gender identity, sex, or sexual orientation. As in 2009, statements of concern were expressed relating to the issues identified in the three reports. NZ was given an opportunity to respond. Recommendations to New Zealand In 2009, delegates gave a list of 64 recommendations. 14 were directed at either the ratification of international instruments or the removal of existing reservations, including supporting the UNDRIP. 7 called for further incorporation of international human rights obligations into domestic law. 3 related to the implementation of treaty body recommendations for the protection of human rights and a further 2 urged cooperation with human rights mechanisms. The vast majority of recommendations related to the area of equality and non-discrimination ‚Äì 22 in total. Among the suggestions were calls to continue to adopt policies to achieve full gender parity and to address the socio-economic inequalities affecting MƒÅori and other minorities, as well as incorporating the fight against xenophobia and racism in the education curriculum. A further 11 were directed at the area of right to life, liberty and security of the person: in particular to increase efforts to combat domestic violence; greater attention to the monitoring of human trafficking; and separate juvenile detention facilities for juvenile offenders. Four were directed specifically at issues concerning MƒÅori: generally to settle land claims comprehensively and provide adequate compensation; and to continue dialogue between the State and MƒÅori regarding the Foreshore and Seabed Act 2004. Two addressed the proposed amendments to the Terrorism Suppression Act and recommended they be dropped. The final recommendation asked NZ to ensure that it consulted with civil society in the follow-up to the UPR recommendations. In 2014, delegates gave a list of 155 recommendations. As in 2009, many recommendations were made regarding the ratification of international human rights instruments and the removal of reservations. 16 recommendations focused on constitutional amendment regarding indigenous rights. Among the suggestions were calls to incorporate the Treaty of Waitangi; take concrete measures to ensure the implementation and promotion of the UN DRIP; and to continue to address all forms of political, economic and social discrimination against the Maori and Pacific population by meeting their various demands for constitutional and legal reforms and recognition. A further 18 recommendations were directed at the socio-economic disparities and discrimination faced by Maori and Pacific peoples; one such recommendation suggested that NZ take further steps to understand the causes of inequality faced by indigenous people and to minimize their effects. 4 recommendations related to structural discrimination; 4 to the inclusion of economic and social rights into the New Zealand Bill of Rights 1990; 5 to the rights of migrants, refugees, asylum-seekers and their families; 1 to surveillance; 1 to counter-terrorism measures; and 7 to child poverty. 25 recommendations were directed at women‚Äôs rights; among these was the call for a national plan to address specific issues such as violence and pay inequality. A further 3 recommendations were made regarding the Canterbury earthquakes; including to consider policies in relation to gender mainstreaming, adequacy of housing and access to buildings for persons with disabilities; and to facilitate the realization of economic, social and cultural rights through the reconstruction of the areas affected. New Zealand response to recommendations In 2009, the Government accepted 33 of the 64 recommendations unreservedly, with an additional 12 agreed to after further discussion. A qualified response was given to 11: for example NZ agreed with the ‚Äúunderlying premise‚Äù of recommendation 21 ‚Äúto continue the public discussion on the status of the Treaty of Waitangi‚Äù, though NZ did ‚Äúnot assume that the current mechanisms in place were inadequate or that entrenchment of the Treaty is the only possible outcome‚Äù. Eight were rejected. Three of these related to International Labour Organization conventions, which NZ believes are inconsistent with NZ‚Äôs ‚Äúunique legal, constitutional and Treaty of Waitangi arrangements.‚Äù The HRC formally adopted the outcomes of NZ‚Äôs UPR on 24 September 2009. The NZ government response to the 2nd cycle of the UPR process was released on 26 May 2014. New Zealand received 155 recommendations as part of the UPR Working Group process. The government response was to accept 121 recommendations and reject 34. Unless accepted outright (fully supported and implemented) reasoning was given for each recommendation, for example, a decision split over distinct areas may be made to accept the ‚Äúspirit‚Äù behind the recommendation but not accept the ‚Äúmethod of implementation‚Äù. The report was adopted by the Human Rights Council on the 19 June 2014. NGOs/Civil Society In the addendum to the 2014 review, after meeting with individuals, NGOs and civil society, NZ received 11 civil society submissions, bringing the total to 54. NGOs and civil society, while able to make submissions, are not part of the Working Group and can sometimes appear to be side-lined. Academics and jurists see UPR as a mechanism to ‚Äúempower‚Äù both civil society and the human rights movement as it affects New Zealanders in everyday life.Conte, A. (2011) ‚ÄúReflections and Challenges: Entering into the Second Cycle of the Universal Periodic Review Mechanism‚Äù New Zealand Yearbook of International Law Vol 9: p 191. McGregor et al states that ‚Äúthe UPR process clearly has raised covenant consciousness generally with civil society in New Zealand.‚ÄùMcGregor, J., Bell, S. and Wilson, M. (2011) Faultlines: Human Rights in New Zealand. New Zealand Law Foundation, p152 Alex Conte discussed the UPR process in between the first and second cycle and stated that many see the key benefit to come out of the process as the greater consultation with civil society as well as to ‚Äúimprove the situation of human rights on the ground‚Äù.Conte, A. (2011) ‚ÄúReflections and Challenges: Entering into the Second Cycle of the Universal Periodic Review Mechanism‚Äù New Zealand Yearbook of International Law Vol 9: p 191. In response to the second cycle of the UPR, NZ acknowledged that some issues, rights relating to sexual orientation. gender identity, intersex people and legal abortion, were not reflected in the recommendations of the Working Group or the interactive dialogue of the UPR. As these issues were raised by the Human Rights Commission and NGOs in the submissions, NZ proposed to follow up separately as part of the ongoing civil society interactions with the UPR. Human Rights Commission National Plan of Action The New Zealand Human Rights Commission has a National Plan of Action for the Protection and Promotion of Human Rights (National Plan of Action). The National Plan of Action bridges the UPR and the work being done on the recommendations looking towards the next review cycle and the people it purports to protect. It was formed by the Human Rights Commission together with local government, iwi, civil society and non-government organisations to respond to and address recommendations made by the second cycle of the UPR.NZ National Plan of Action: https://www.hrc.co.nz/your-rights/human-rights/our-work/npa/ The plan is available publicly on the Human Rights Commission website and there is an interactive webtool which ‚Äúmonitors human rights in New Zealand‚Äù. The Human Rights Commission coordinates and develops the National Plan of Action but it is mandated by the Human Rights Act 1993. It is a collaborative effort. Government agencies identify actions which will ‚Äúprogress the UPR recommendations accepted by government.‚Äù The Human Rights Commission identify ‚Äúcivil society stakeholders who should be involved in creating and monitoring‚Äù the actions. The plan then sets out ‚Äúa small number of concrete, achievable actions with timeframes‚Äù and holds identifiable agencies accountable. These are reported as per the plan. There are four main focus areas for the National Plan of Action: * How human rights issues are managed within the policy and law making processes * New Zealand‚Äôs growing diversity and its impacts on our society and race relations * Issues raised in respect of inequalities and discrimination in New Zealand * Tackling violence and abuse in New Zealand =Criticism= There was a plan for a National Plan after the first cycle of UPR, however the government did not adopt it. McGregor et al discusses the consequence of that failure to adopt the first plan as various civil society and NGOs required more clarity from the plan for the second National Plan of Action and had concerns about the outcome of the plan.McGregor, J., Bell, S. and Wilson, M. (2011) Faultlines: Human Rights in New Zealand. New Zealand Law Foundation, p156. Academic assessment =Responses to recommendations= The first cycle of UPR had problems with responses to recommendations and concerns about the implementation of recommendations. Conte discussed the problems which evolved from having three answers available to states: accept, reject and partially accept. This led to convoluted answers from some states which slowed the process. For the second cycle the answers were more defined being only accept or reject, however as an official report written by Judy McGregor, Sylvia Bell and Margaret Wilson (McGregor et al) shows answers were still convoluted. New Zealand rejected 34 recommendations but used language such as ‚ÄúNew Zealand accepts the spirit of these recommendations, but is unable to accept them in full‚Äù when rejecting a recommendation. McGregor et al see this as ‚Äúdifferentiating‚Äù between ‚Äúacceptance through spirit and acceptance through action.‚Äù McGregor, J., Bell, S. and Wilson, M. (2011) Faultlines: Human Rights in New Zealand. New Zealand Law Foundation., p148 Language used is an ongoing and complex concern with responses as they impact on the level of action taken by states.McGregor, J., Bell, S. and Wilson, M. (2011) Faultlines: Human Rights in New Zealand. New Zealand Law Foundation, p148 =Ratification and compliance= Conte said that UPR would need to ‚Äúlive up to expectations‚Äù and really change ‚Äúhuman rights on the ground translating the recommendations and commitments made under the first cycle into measurable improvements‚Äù.Conte, A. (2011) ‚ÄúReflections and Challenges: Entering into the Second Cycle of the Universal Periodic Review Mechanism‚Äù New Zealand Yearbook of International Law Vol 9: 201. McGregor et al outlines the progression of New Zealand‚Äôs human rights instruments with the ongoing UPR process. There has been little progress since the first UPR cycle in 2009 in terms of ratification of human rights treaties in New Zealand. This is largely because compliance was already high as New Zealand is an early adopter of many significant treaties. In 2010 New Zealand accepted the United Nations Declaration on the Rights of Indigenous Peoples. McGregor et al found that there has been a ‚Äúmaturing of process‚Äù from the first cycle of UPR to the second and that this can be seen in the wider involvement in civil society, the increased prominence of the Human Rights Commission and the increase in the number of recommendations from cycle one to cycle two.McGregor, J., Bell, S. and Wilson, M. (2011) Faultlines: Human Rights in New Zealand. New Zealand Law Foundation, p151. Media Coverage of UPR The UPR process is not closely covered by New Zealand media. Media coverage of human rights issues is centred on specific issues relevant to current events which were covered in UPR recommendations to NZ. This is similar to global trends in reporting of UPR in mainstream media.Charlesworth, H and Larking, E. (eds) (2015). Human Rights and the Universal Periodic Review. Cambridge University Press, p 148. The lack of publicity given to the UPR process in NZ was described by McGregor et al as an ‚Äúexisting indifference of the mainstream news media to human rights treaty body reporting in terms of publicity and promotion.‚ÄùMcGregor, J., Bell, S. and Wilson, M. (2011) Faultlines: Human Rights in New Zealand. New Zealand Law Foundation, p159 This was not the position of the government. Media attention was described by the Minister of Justice as being of a ‚Äúmoderate amount‚Äù, however academics such as McGregor at al see this as an inflated assessment which precludes open reporting and creates a barrier to awareness of human rights and treaty body reporting being reported in a clear and systematic way.McGregor, J., Bell, S. and Wilson, M. (2011) Faultlines: Human Rights in New Zealand. New Zealand Law Foundation, p159 In McGregor et al‚Äôs report a practical recommendation was given to improve reporting of human rights and the international treaty body system. It was suggested that Journalists Educators‚Äô Association of New Zealand (JEANZ) and the Human Rights Commission (HRC) work together to develop a ‚Äúpractical toolkit for journalists‚Äù to encourage and facilitate reporting.McGregor, J., Bell, S. and Wilson, M.

They could own property and were, at court, legally equal to men. However, Ancient Egypt was a society dominated by men and was patriarchal in nature. Women could not have important positions in administration, though there were women rulers and even women pharaohs. Women at the royal court gained their positions by relationship to male kings.F. G.

Bread- and beer-making (made of fermented bread) were usually women's tasks. Twelfth dynasty of Egypt, 2050-1800 BCE. Egyptian Museum of Berlin. Most women belonged to the peasantry, and worked alongside their husbands doing agricultural work. Women were known to manage farms or businesses in the absence of their husbands or sons. Among the upper classes of society, a woman usually did not work outside the home, and instead supervised the servants of the household and her children's education. An exception is the textile industry. Here women are well attested as weavers. A letter found at Lahun and dating around 1800 BC names six female weavers.Marc Collier, Stephen Quirke: The UCL Lahun Papyri: Accounts, Oxford 2006, , 144-145 In the Old Kingdom wealthy women often owned an own household. There were working men and women side by side, and it is not uncommon to find in the stuff of a women's household other women with administrative titles. Especially in tomb scenes of the periods, men are often served by men, while women are served by women. Here, a separation of sexes is visible.Henry George Fischer: Egyptian Woman of the Old Kingdom And of the Heracleopolitan Period, Second Edition, revised and augmented, New York 2000 iISBN 0-87099-967-2, pp. 19-10 online Women belonging to families wealthy enough to hire nannies to help with childcare frequently worked as perfume-makers, and also were employed in courts and temples, as acrobats, dancers, singers, and musicians, which were all considered respectable pursuits for upper-class women. Women belonging to any class could work as professional mourners or musicians, and these were common jobs. Noblewomen could be members of the priesthood connected to either a god or goddess. Women could even be at the head of a business as, for example, the lady Nenofer of the New Kingdom, and could also be a doctor, like the lady Peseshet during the Fourth dynasty of Egypt.  Family and marriage  = Marriage = The purpose of marriage was to have more children and descendants of the family. In the New Kingdom there was a saying that: \\"Take a wife while you are young That she make a son for you She should bear for you while you are youthful It is proper to make people Happy is the man whose people are many He is saluted on account of his progeny. \\" It is true that some egalitarian relationship between husband and wife was implied in Egypt depiction. For example, in love songs, brother and sister carried the same significance as husband and wife. \\"Sn\\", the Egyptian word for \\"brother\\", also meant \\"peer\\", \\"mate\\", or \\"second\\". Thus, the love songs may be referring to the egalitarian relationship between husband and wife.Marriage and Family Life in Ancient Egypt by Ray Erwin Baber, Social Forces, Vol. 13, No. 3 (Mar., 1935), pp. 409-414 The example for interbreeding among royalty was set by the gods since Osiris married his sister, Isis. However, depictions usually show a husband and wife in an affectionate attitude with their children, so we assume most families were generally happy, but marriage was more realistic. The wife shared responsibilities and worked with her husband. Marriages in ancient Egypt were usually monogamous, but it also was not uncommon for a man of high economic status to have more than one wife. This was especially true if the man's first wife was unable to have children of her own. Although it was possible to divorce, it was very difficult. Marriages were usually arranged by parents, who chose appropriate partners for their children. Despite what the laws stated, it was suggested that women made more family decisions and controlled more of the home than usual. Women had control over most of their property, could serve as legal persons who brought cases to the court, and even worked in public. Husbands did not take total control over their wives property because women had a degree of independence in ancient Egypt. For example, from ca. 365 B.C, a new marriage contract was emerged which mainly protected women from divorce, placing more financial burdens on men. The influence of queens and queen mothers was considered as a big reason for women's special rights in ancient Egypt compared to other societies at that time. Queens and queen mothers always had a great power since many pharaohs were very young when they succeeded the throne. For example, the great pharaoh Ahmose I in New Kingdom, always took advice from his mother, Ahhotep I, and his principal wife, Nefertari. Although the women of ancient Egypt were viewed as one of the most independent groups of women, widowhood could result in suspicion due to the lack of male control. Widows also gained more legal freedom, being able to buy and sell land, making donations, and even making loans. = Pregnancy = Wall relief showing childbirth, Treasure Hall, Temple of Edfu (Egypt) There is much evidence of complex beliefs and practices in ancient Egypt related to the important role fertility played in society. If a woman was not fertile, her husband could potentially divorce her for not producing heirs. Religious beliefs included rules concerning purification, similar to other religions in the region. Women in Egypt were believed to be eliminating impure elements during menstruation, and were excused from work and could not enter the restricted rooms of temples while menstruating. Fertility rituals were used by couples desiring children. Contraception was permitted as well, and medical texts survive that refer to many contraceptive formulas (although the ingredients are often now difficult to identify). Some formulas, such as drinks made of celery base and beer, are dubious, but others show a basic knowledge of somewhat effective methods, such as a spermicide made of fermented acacia gum, which produces a sperm-killing lactic acid. Once pregnant, the uterus was placed under the protection of a specific goddess, Tenenet. Ritual medical care was given by anointing the woman's body with beneficial oils, using a small bottle in the form of a woman posed with her hands placed on a round belly. There was a way in the Egyptian society for families who wanted to know the sex of their baby, which spread to Greece, Byzantium, and then to Europe, where it was practiced for centuries without anyone realizing its origins in ancient Egypt. It involves placing grains of barley and wheat in a cloth sachet and soaking them in the pregnant woman's urine; if barley sprouted first, the baby was said to be a boy, and if the wheat sprouted first, the baby was said to be a girl. In ancient Egypt, the word for barley was the synonym of \\"father\\". = Childbirth = When it was time for childbirth, the pregnant woman was assisted by midwives. She would be shaved, including her head. The midwives would support the woman during labor while she remained in a squatting position on a mat. On the corners of the mat were placed four bricks, believed to be the incarnation of four goddesses: Nut, the great goddess of the sky; Tefnut, the elder, the feminine polarity of the first couple; Aset the beautiful; and Nebet-Het, the excellent.  Women playing an official role at the highest levels  Old Kingdom Egyptian princess Nefertiabet (dated 2590-2565 BCE) from her tomb at Giza, painting on limestone, now in the Louvre Few ancient civilizations enabled women to achieve important social positions. The same is true for ancient Egypt. There are only very few examples of women as high officials. Only very few women made it into the highest office, that of Pharaoh. One example of a woman in a high state position is Nebet who became vizier in the Sixth Dynasty. The vizier was the highest state official, second only to the king.Henry George Fischer: Egyptian Woman of the Old Kingdom And of the Heracleopolitan Period, Second Edition, revised and augmented, New York 2000 iISBN 0-87099-967-2, pp. 36-37 online Egyptian society of antiquity, like many other civilizations of the time, used religion as a foundation for society. This was how the throne of the power of the Pharaohs was justified, as anointed by the gods, and the holder of the throne had a divine right. Typically, in ancient societies power was transferred from one male to the next. Women gave birth to the heirs, signaling importance towards marriage, as well. The son inherited the power, and in cases where the king did not have a son, the throne was then inherited by the male members of the family further removed from the king, such as cousins or uncles. But even if the monarch had daughters, they could not gain power. In Egyptian civilization, this obligation of passing power to a male successor was not without exceptions. Royal blood, a factor determined by divine legitimacy, was the unique criteria for access to the throne. However, the divine essence was transmitted to the royal spouse, as was the case with Nefertiti, wife of Akhenaton. Egyptians preferred to be governed by a woman with royal blood (being divine according to mythology) rather than by a man who did not have royal blood. Also, during crises of succession, there were women who took power. When this happened, the female Pharaoh adopted all of the masculine symbols of the throne. There even exist doubts, in some instances, about the sex of certain Pharaohs who could have been women. During the Eighteenth dynasty of Egypt, when Amenhotep I died, his successor Thutmose I appears to have not been his son, at least he was not the child of a secondary wife of the late Pharaoh; if his wife Ahmes was related to Amenhotep I, this union permitted divine legitimacy. For the following successor, princess Hatshepsut, daughter of Thutmose I and the Great Royal Wife, enabled Thutmose II, son of his second wife and therefore half- brother of the princess, to gain the throne by marrying him. A bronze statue of a Divine Adoratrice of Amun, from the Twenty-second dynasty of Egypt, in the Egyptian Museum of Berlin. It became more common for women to gain the throne in ancient Egypt. For example, as with Hatshepsut, who took the place of her nephew Thutmose III. When Hatshepsut inherited the throne from her late husband and became Pharaoh, her daughter Neferure took on a role that exceeded the normal duties of a royal princess, acquiring a more queenly role. There were also the Cleopatras, of whom the best known is Cleopatra VII (69 BCE to 30 BCE), famous for her beauty and her relationships with Julius Caesar and then Marc Antony, the leaders who depended upon her throne. The women Pharaohs who are best known, and of whom historians are most certain, are: * Nitocris (Sixth dynasty of Egypt) * Sobekneferu (Twelfth dynasty of Egypt), * Hatshepsut (Eighteenth dynasty of Egypt), * Neferneferuaten (Eighteenth dynasty of Egypt), * Twosret (Nineteenth dynasty of Egypt). Many of the Great Royal Wives also played significant diplomatic and political roles: * Tiyi wife of (Amenhotep III) * Nefertiti wife of (Amenhotep IV) * Nefertari wife of (Ramses II) Elsewhere in the New Kingdom, the Great Wife was often invested with a divine role: \\"Wife of god\\", \\"Hand of god\\". Hatshepsut was the first Great wife (of Thutmose II) to receive this latter title. For women holding office in the highest levels of the bureaucracy, one can cite Nebet, a Vizir in ancient Egypt during the Sixth dynasty of Egypt. It is necessary to recognize that a woman at such a high level of authority remained extremely rare and it was not until the Twenty-sixth dynasty of Egypt that a similar situation can be found. Women did, however, occupy numerous offices such as scribe in the bureaucracy, except during the New Kingdom, where all public bureaucracy posts were filled by men. There was also the Divine Adoratrice of Amun, granted major spiritual power, but also a power restricted to Thebes.  Women in ancient Egyptian literature  Fayum mummy portrait, circa 100-200 CE, Louvre Museum, Paris. Certainly, the literature of ancient Egypt did not hesitate to present women as frivolous, capricious, and rarely trustworthy. But despite this, women benefitted from a status that was rare in the civilizations of the time. While the painters and sculptors gave to women a serene image as part of a happy family, the writers were not tender, and they portrayed women as being the origin of misfortune and guilty of many sins (where one can see a form of the myth of Eve and the apple, or Pandora). As Gaston Maspero describes in Contes populaires (Popular Tales), there was the fatal misadventure of Bytaou, the humble farmhand at the home of his brother Anoupou. Seduced by the wife of his brother, he succumbs to the charm of her beauty. She does not hesitate to denounce him to Anoupou, lying and never ceasing until she obtains the ultimate punishment for Bytaou at the hands of Anoupou. But she is punished in turn; Anoupou discovers much later that he has been played for a fool by his wife, who he kills, and throws her body to the dogs. It is important not to interpret this incorrectly: the rarely flattering portrayal of women in Egyptian literature does not reveal for nothing that women were despised. The Pharaoh was often given the same treatment by storytellers who presented the Pharaoh as a stubborn and whimsical character. Men were invited to cherish their wives. Ptahhotep (Third dynasty of Egypt) expressed this in the following maxim (written in the Papyrus Prisse): \\"You must love your wife with all your heart, [...], make her heart happy as long as you live\\". Romance was present in Egyptian literature, for example, in a papyrus at the Leyden Museum:  Women in ancient Egyptian art  Upper torso of a woman's figurine. Slit eyes and mouth. She wears an elaborate headdress. Pottery fragment. Ramesside period. From Egypt. The Petrie Museum of Egyptian Archaeology, London Nefertiti with body similar to Akhenaten's Egyptian women were seldom depicted as ageing and wrinkled; there were standards to be met. The women were shown as slender and beautiful, partly so that they could take on that frame in the afterlife. Egyptian art was far from realistic. It shows how much the ancient Egyptians cared about how they were perceived. There were hardly any images of pregnant women or women's bodies after giving birth. The man, however, could be shown as athletic and engaging or old and experienced. These idealistic depictions would reflect the targeted image, such as the physically able king, or the tired king who works day and night for his people. People were depicted at the peak of their beauty and youth, in an attempt to remain so forever. However, in the Third Intermediate Period, scholars see a shifting in the artistic style representing women. A more rounded body type appeared, with larger, more drooping breasts and a thickened body.Forever Young? The Representation of Older and Ageing Women in Ancient Egyptian Art by Deborah Sweeney, Journal of the American Research Center in Egypt, Vol. 41, (2004), pp. 67-84 This depiction was no longer necessarily associated with the ageing of women. There was also a certain \\"type\\" to be followed. Women, and children, were represented with an artistic style that would link them to their husband or father. The most obvious example would be the Amarna Period. Akhenaten's Amarna Period hosted great changes in artistic style. However, the most distinctive part was how Nefertiti, his wife, and his kids were shown with the same body type as his, which was quite unique for that matter. There are depictions showing Nefertiti with a body so similar to Akhenaten's, that you couldn't tell which one of them it was; long chins, round waists, full buttocks, sunken cheekbones and full lips. But there are also other depictions showing Nefertiti completely different, with a feminine face and a slender shape. After the Amarna Period, elite women were occasionally shown with fuller breasts.  Divine image  Osiris and Isis, statuettes at the Hermitage Museum, St. Petersburg, Russia. In the abundance of divinities in Egyptian mythology, there existed a large number of goddesses, as was also the case in Greece. By studying their symbolism one can learn the image that women had in the eyes of the ancient Egyptians. As with Greek divinities, many were related to one another, by blood or marriage, such as Isis and her sister Nephthys, both the respective wives of Osiris (the god of the dead) and of Seth, themselves brothers. Women and their image were most often associated with life and fertility. In the case of the goddess Isis, who was associated with many principles: as the wife of Osiris who was killed by his brother, she was connected to funeral rites. As a mother, she became the feminine protector, but above all the mother-creator, she who gives life. Through this goddess, the principles of life and death were closely linked. In effect, while she was associated with funeral rites, these rites were to prevent the deceased from submitting to a second death in the succeeding dimension, which explains among other things, the food found in abundance by archeologists in the tombs. On the other hand, life in its physical aspect meaningful only by death, because these principles are part of a movement of eternal new beginning that is then in a sense more spiritual, the movement of life, or eternal life. A symbol of the goddess is also the palm tree, the symbol of eternal life. She breathed the breath of eternal life to her dead husband. The goddess represented the era's regard for women, because it was crucial to maintain the spirit in her image, it was this idea of eternal life and of maturity that Isis reflected, venerated as the Celestial Mother. It was in this role that Isis was arguably made the most important deity of Egyptian mythology. Her influence even extended to religions of different civilizations, where she would become identified under different names and where her cult grew, particularly in the Roman Empire. The most influential goddesses were: * Isis: goddess of magic and mysticism, * Hathor: goddess of nourishment and love, * Bastet: goddess protector of the home, * Sekhmet: goddess of wrath = God's Wives = \\"God's Wife of Amun\\" was the highest- ranking priestess of the Amun cult. At the beginning of the New Kingdom, the title was associated with royalty, usually kings' wives or kings' mothers. The first royal wife to hold this title was Ahmose-Nefertari, wife of Ahmose I, who then passed it on to her daughter, Meritamen who then passed it on to Hatshepsut. Both Ahmose-Nefertari and Hatshepsut used this title as an alternative to King's Principal Wife which reflects the significance that lay behind the title. The title God's Wife was another title given to royal women in sacral roles. In the Nubian and Saite Periods, they built their own chapels and mortuary temples. In addition to God's Wife, these women had other titles such as Divine Adorer or God's Hand. As religious figures, some would expect that they would remain pure. However, the sexual endeavors of the Gods' Wives were left to question; the concept of chastity in a religious sense wasn't relevant to the ancient Egyptians' religious practice.God's Wife, God's Servant: The God's Wife of Amun (c. 740‚Äì525 BC) by Mariam F. Ayad  Influence of the image  = Rediscovery of ancient Egypt during the era of Napoleon = In 1798, Napoleon Bonaparte led a campaign in Egypt that would be a military fiasco, but which enabled him to return to France with drawings and observations by artists and scientists that he had brought on the expedition. But it was in 1822 that Egypt became more open to researchers, the wider world developed a passion for ancient Egypt, and wanted to know more about its history and its culture. The fascination with Egypt that followed, and with everything that concerned Antiquity, carried a powerful influence. In this era, in Paris, almost all fields of creativity were heavily inspired by the rediscoveries from Antiquity. The arts became redirected along this path, following the fashion for ancient Egypt down every esthetic route. In this way, clothing styles changed, and women during the Napoleonic Empire adopted styles associated with ancient Egyptian women, combined with the influence of Ancient Greece and Rome: corsets were abandoned (only temporarily), as well as petticoats, and the raised Empire waist was the popular dress silhouette. Dresses were lighter, and were decorated with motifs from Antiquity, for example palm trees, one of the symbols of the goddess Isis. = Modern images of women in ancient Egypt = Theda Bara poses in a still image from Cleopatra. Exotic sets and costumes, depicting a fantasy version of ancient Egypt, were a good fit for Theda Bara's popular \\"vamp\\" image. Elizabeth Taylor and Richard Burton starred in Cleopatra. When women in ancient Egypt are evoked, the first image that comes to mind for most is that of Cleopatra, or more precisely, Cleopatra VII. Although having a Greek origin, it is she who would be associated with the image of women in ancient Egypt, for several generations. This has been in large part due to modern cinema, especially the films of the Golden Age of Hollywood. During the 1950s and 1960s, a number of costume dramas were produced, putting on screen Egyptian women imagined during this era where filmmakers want to show glamour. In 1963, the glamorous image of Cleopatra was cemented for the public in the film Cleopatra directed by Joseph L. Mankiewicz, and portrayed by Liz Taylor. This passion for the queen is explained by the tumultuous life that she lived, full of intrigues, romances (her two most famous lovers being Julius Caesar and Marc Antony), her power, and her tragic death (she died by suicide). In short, she fascinates, by her life and by what she did. Through her connection to ancient Egypt, she has an aura of mystery for spectators, the same aura that surrounds ancient Egypt and its esoteric aspects, the same mysteriousness linked in the popular imagination with ancient curses of mummies, or other secrets of the tombs. Presented this way, Egyptian women become a sort of seductress, fascinating because of a romanticized view of her. As a sign of celebrity, this imagined Egypt has not only been the object of fantasies but has also been caricatured. The best-known of these caricatures today are those appearing in such media of popular culture as the Ast√©rix comic books of Ren√© Goscinny and Albert Uderzo. Playing on the glamorous image created by cinema, the authors satirize the fascination that Cleopatra exercises on those around her, focusing especially on her nose and exaggerating her queenly status by depicting her as capricious and temperamental, far-removed from the ideal of the seductive woman so often imagined. In a more general manner, this image of Egyptian women, forceful, behind a mysterious and magical veil, and exercising a seductive power, continues to this day, for example in the American series Stargate SG-1, or again in Luc Besson's film The Fifth Element (1997). Fashion designers are also regularly inspired by the iconography of Egyptian women, who have become an esthetic point of reference.  Social and political position of women  Couple harvesting cropsFemale musiciansAmenhotep III and Queen Tiye In many of ancient Egypt's artistic approaches, we see women supporting or clasping their husband, maybe even protecting them. So in some sense, the woman could be the protector, probably associated with the concept of protective goddesses. Women mingled in society, we see evidence of that where peasant women were depicted helping with the harvest;Women's Monumental Mark on Ancient Egypt by Barbara S. Lesko, The Biblical Archaeologist, Vol. 54, No. 1 (Mar., 1991), pp. 4-15 townswomen are shown as professional musicians, dancers,Women's Monumental Mark on Ancient Egypt by Barbara S. Lesko, The Biblical Archaeologist, Vol. 54, No. 1 (Mar., 1991), pp. 4-15 members of temple staff and party guests. So women weren't just traditional stay at home wives, but they contributed to society and sometimes even in untraditional ways. There are scenes of women in weaving workshops, and tomb inscriptions of women's professional involvement. Such titles could range from political to religious to funerary. Some titles inscribed on tombs were mainly honorific; to honor the women after they die. Some examples of titles are: Overseer of Female Physicians, Judge and Vizier, Director of the Dining Hall, and Overseer of Funerary Priests.Women's Monumental Mark on Ancient Egypt by Barbara S. Lesko, The Biblical Archaeologist, Vol. 54, No. 1 (Mar., 1991), pp. 4-15 Religious positions weren't limited to noblewomen as some would think, in fact, we see evidence of priestesses of major goddesses bearing humble titles like tenant farmer. As history moves from the Old Kingdom to the Middle Kingdom, we see less and less of women in authority which may suggest changes in political and social norms. In the New Kingdom, however, texts show that women had their own legal identity and could even purchase and inherit land without the need for male consent. During this period, women were portrayed in all shapes and sizes, where their status and wealth were reflected in the size of their statue. Idealistic portrayals were an important part of Egyptian art, mainly because they believed that these representations would follow them into eternity. Egyptian mothers were a significant part of ancient Egypt. Egyptian men, even those of the highest social class, often placed only their mother's names on their monuments. Egyptian mothers were more prominently displayed than the fathers, also in literature. The ancient Egyptians paid attention to size and quantity; large tombs indicated a significance of the deceased. Some queens of the early dynasties even commemorated tombs as large as their husbands'. The pair statue of Amenhotep III and his common-born wife, Queen Tiye, dominates a room at the Cairo Museum, showing the queen as of equal size as the king. Hatshepsut, unsatisfied with her status as second best to her father, took it to clarifying her divine conception, so as to legitimize her ruling as pharaoh by recording the miracle of her birth on the walls of the second terrace.

His performances for the Gipsies produced an invitation to represent England in the first ever international in 1871 at Raeburn Place in Scotland. England were to lose this encounter, but Bentley was also involved in the return match the following year at The Oval where England were the victors. Arthur Guillemard of the Chislehurst-based West Kent Football Club, who also played in those first two international games, said of Bentley that he was very fast and much helped by his weight and strength, \\"which on one occasion at Chislehurst enabled him to run-in carrying two of his opponents on his back as if they were rag dolls\\", Bentley continued to watch international rugby right up to his last years. His obituary in his old school's magazine, The Taylorian of 1914, recalled that \\"he appeared at the South Africa v.

She was married to Prime Minister of Norway Otto Blehr, and was therefore addressed as \\"Madam Prime Minister\\" () during her lifetime. She was one of the preeminent leaders of the Norwegian women's rights movement from the 1880s and co-counded the Norwegian Association for Women's Rights, serving as its President from 1895 to 1899 and from 1903 to 1922. She also initiated the establishment of the Norwegian Women's Public Health Association that grew to become a humanitarian organisation with 250,000 members. She was a leading advocate of Norwegian independence from Sweden and took on representative duties for Norway during her husband's tenure as Prime Minister. Background Blehr was born Randi Nilsen in 1851 in Bergen to ship broker, Andreas Rasmussen Nilsen 1822‚Äì98) and Margrethe Andrea Torn√∏e (1827‚Äì1909); she was the oldest of eleven children. She received no formal education but pursued the arts from a young age, including drawing, theatre and music. When she was 17 years old, she joined Vestmannalaget, Norway's oldest language association. She was involved in the establishment of Den Nationale Scene, Bergen's oldest and largest theatre, in 1876, and in the same year she married Otto Blehr, a lawyer and a politician for the left-wing Liberal Party who would later become the Prime Minister of Norway; their son was Eivind Blehr. Career Blehr became involved in the Norwegian feminist movement in the 1880s. She joined Skuld, a discussion group for female students, in 1883, and was one of the co-founders of the Norwegian Association for Women's Rights (Kvindesagsforening) in 1884. She later became the chairperson of the organisation for over two periods: 1895 to 1899, and from 1903 to 1922. As chair of the Association for Women's Rights, Blehr fought for improvement of the social and economic conditions for housewives, working class and lower-middle class women. She petitioned the parliament to formalise vocational education for women by creating training courses for maids, seamstresses, cooks and housewives. Under Blehr's leadership, the association also advocated for equal pay and for children born out of wedlock to have their paternity recognised legally. In 1885, since the Association for Women's Rights decided not to include women's suffrage on its agenda, Blehr co-founded the Women's Suffrage Association (Kvinnestemmerettsforeningen) under Gina Krog's leadership. A year later, she also helped to establish the Norwegian Women's Public Health Association (Norske Kvinners Sanitetsforening). In 1903 she was elected the chair of the Norwegian Women's Peace Association (Norske Kvinners Fredsforbund). During periods where her husband's political career required them to leave their home in Oslo and live in Sweden, she took on representative duties as the spouse of the Prime Minister and hostess at the Norwegian government's residence in Stockholm. Blehr was awarded the King's Medal of Merit in Gold (Kongens fortjenstmedalje) on her 70th birthday in 1921. She died during 1928 and was buried at the Cemetery of Our Saviour in Oslo.

Taos Pueblo is a book by Ansel Adams and Mary Hunter Austin. Originally published in 1930, it is the first book of Adams' photographs. A seminal work in his career, it marks the beginning of a transition from his earlier pictorialist style to his signature sharp-focused images of the Western landscape. Because of the quality of the images and its place in the development of Adams' style, it has been described as \\"an astonishingly poignant‚Ä¶masterpiece\\" and \\"the greatest pictorial representation of the American West.\\" Santa Fe In the spring of 1929 Adams and his wife traveled to New Mexico to photograph the landscape there and to visit with friends. In Santa Fe, New Mexico they spent almost two months with writer Mary Hunter Austin, and within a short time Adams and Austin agreed that they should collaborate on a book about the area around Santa Fe. Austin introduced Adams to her friend and Santa Fe arts patron Mabel Dodge Luhan, whose husband Tony Lujan [she spelled her last name differently from her husband] was a member of the Taos tribal council. Through Lujan's influence, Adams was given permission by the Taos Indians to photograph in and around the then relatively unknown Taos Pueblo. After taking some initial photographs, Adams contacted his friend and patron Albert M. Bender, who had previously produced Adams' first portfolio of prints Parmelian Prints of the High Sierras. Bender enthusiastically agreed to sponsor a book based on this new work, and he contacted his friends at the Grabhorn Press to produce it. Adams and Austin continued to work independently on their respective parts of the book; they did not see each other's work until the book was ready to print. Adams said he picked the final selection of images to match Austin's prose, and in part because of this her text is said to have \\"mirrored the sturdy repetitions of the pueblo architecture\\" as seen in many of the photographs. San Francisco de Asis Mission Church In spite of the book's title one of Adams' signature images from the book was taken at San Francisco de Asis Mission Church, which is not part of the pueblo itself but is located several miles away. He was captivated by the massive walls and buttresses of the church, saying they \\"seem an outcropping of the earth rather than merely an object constructed upon it.\\" At the same time, the church was an embodiment of the ongoing cultural conflicts in the area between the Indian and Hispanic cultures; it was a Catholic church built in Indian style and represented how the Taos Indians' survival was achieved in part through cultural adaptation by necessity. Special paper Although it was published in book form, Taos Pueblo was illustrated with true photographic prints hand-produced by Adams. Adams insisted that the book have a consistent appearance throughout, and to meet his high standards a special paper was created that was used for both the text and the photographs. To do this he enlisted the help of Will Dassonville, a friend and producer of photographic papers in the Bay Area. Dassonville ordered a warm-colored, rag-base paper from a New England mill, then divided the order into two batches. The first went to the Grabhorn Press for the text pages, and the second was custom-coated by Dassonville with a silver-bromide emulsion. Adams was able to print directly on the latter paper, which had an exceptional tonal range and a matte surface, and develop it in his darkroom. Over a period of several months during the fall of 1929, Adams personally made nearly 1,300 prints for the book edition. Editions The book was published in a limited edition of 100 signed and numbered copies, plus eight artist's copies, each containing twelve original prints. Bender set the price of the book at $75 per copy, which was a very high figure during the Great Depression when the average annual income for an American family was about $1,300. Bender, however, reached out to his wealthy friends, and within two years the edition was sold out. Bender quipped: \\"I note the Stock Market reports only Ansel Adams photographs as the sole commodity that is on the rise.\\" With the cooperation of Adams, in 1977 the New York Graphic Society published a facsimile edition of the original, using gravure prints rather than original photographs. It was produced in a limited edition of 950 copies, each signed by Adams. In the afterword to that edition, photographic historian Weston Naef wrote: In September, 2011, a copy of the original 1930 edition was offered for sale for $85,000. In 2014, rare book dealers were offering available original copies for $65,000 and $75,000 and between $1,500 and $3,000 for the 1977 facsimile edition.Abebooks query Notes External links Category:Books of photographs Category:Black-and-white photographs Category:Taos County, New Mexico Category:Taos, New Mexico Category:Photographs of the United States * Category:1930 in art Category:1930 non-fiction books ","title":"Taos Pueblo (book)"},{"id":"33046220","title":"Then He Touched Me"},{"id":"33046222","text":"The Georgia Razors are an expansion franchise of the American Basketball Association which began play in the 2011‚Äì2012 season.

It has rough bark on the trunk and branches, broadly lance-shaped adult leaves, flower buds in groups of seven, creamy yellow, pink or red flowers, and barrel-shaped, ribbed fruit. Description Corymbia ptychocarpa is a tree that typically grows to a height of and has thick, rough, tessellated, brownish bark on the trunk and branches. It has the form of a crooked tree that tends to flop when young and often has drooping branches. Young plants and coppice regrowth have oblong to round or elliptical, later egg-shaped leaves that are long, wide and petiolate. Adult leaves are leathery, paler on the lower surface, broadly lance-shaped, long and wide, tapering to a petiole long. The midrib is pale yellow in contrast to the green lamina and the lateral veins are parallel to each other. The flowers are borne on the ends of branchlets on a branched peduncle long, each branch of the peduncle with seven buds on pedicels long. Mature buds are oval to pear-shaped, long and wide with a rounded to blunt-conical operculum. Flowering occurs from February to May and the flowers are creamy yellow, pink or red. The fruit is a woody, barrel-shaped capsule long and wide with about eight sharp ribs on the sides and the valves enclosed in the fruit. Taxonomy and naming Swamp bloodwood was first formally described in 1859 by Ferdinand von Mueller who gave it the name Eucalyptus ptychocarpa and published the description in the Journal of the Proceedings of the Linnean Society, Botany. In 1995 Ken Hill and Lawrence Alexander Sidney Johnson changed the name to Corymbia ptychocarpa. In the same paper, Hill and Johnson described two subspecies and the names are accepted by the Australian Plant Census: * Corymbia ptychocarpa subsp. aptycha K.D.Hill & L.A.S.Johnson that differs from the autonym in having the flower buds and fruit not, or only indistinctly ribbed. * Corymbia ptychocarpa (F.Muell.) K.D.Hill & L.A.S.Johnson subsp. ptychocarpa. Distribution and habitat Corymbia ptychocarpa is found from the Kimberley region of Western Australia and through the Top End of the Northern Territory to near Doomadgee in far north-western Queensland. It grows in sandy soils and alluvium along watercourses and near springs. In the Northern Territory it occurs on the Arnhem Plateau, Daly Basin, Ord Victoria Plain, Pine Creek and the Victoria Bonaparte biogeographic regions. Subspecies aptycha is restricted to the Top End between the Cobourg Peninsula, Yirrkala amd El Sharana in Arnhem Land. It is also grown as a street tree in parts of Queensland such as Cairns and Townsville.

The Catacombs Nightclub was a gay after hours nightclub in Philadelphia that played underground dance music which became the precursor to house music. Additionally, Catacombs was responsible for the creation of the dance music genre \\"Philly Classics,\\" and as a cultural center the club was a haven for music industry professionals and artists of diverse backgrounds in the early 80's.  History - The Evolution of a Nightclub and the Creation of a New Genre of Music  Second Story, Philadelphia's premier nightclub, was located at 12th and Walnut Streets in Center City Philadelphia. \\"The Story\\"‚Äîas it was lovingly called by the weekly regulars‚Äîwas the vision of brothers Barry Geftman and Wayne Geftman. Disco-disco.com, Other legendary US clubs The Geftman brothers‚Äô original concept was to create a private, gay club with an environment that featured unique interiors, superior music, excellent sound, and innovative lighting. Under the banner of Disco Design, LTD., Wayne oversaw most of the creative and technical aspects of the club, while Barry deftly performed the administrative duties, including staffing and promotions. As brothers, they were able to harness a natural synergy, which was the primary key to their success. Before Second Story was realized, Wayne and Barry had created their first nightclub, the Music Box. The club was known as the place to be at the Jersey Shore during summers in the 1970s. New York's ‚ÄúDiscoteckin Magazine‚Äù called it ‚Äúa club worth leaving New York for.‚Äù The sound system was designed by Rosner Custom Sound and was installed by Rosner's lead engineer‚ÄîDonald Carucci, known as an expert in the field of nightclub sound. The Music Box's sound system was unparalleled, and Wayne and DJ Frankie ‚ÄúWho‚Äù Sestito frequently turned the music UP, which further cemented the club's popularity. With the success of the Music Box at the Jersey Shore, the Geftman brothers realized that it was time to bring their concepts to Philadelphia; hence, the Second Story was born. Second Story opened its doors on December 6, 1976, after three years of intense design. The facility was in a former church, and key elements from the original building were utilized in its interior design. Rosner designed a state-of-the-art sound system, featuring components that, at the time, were rarely used in the nightclub environment. Billboard Magazine, January 22, 1977 The light show was also designed with meticulous care, under Barry's close scrutiny. The club opened as a private, gay nightclub. It changed to a more mainstream format after 13 months, which led to unprecedented success and to its reputation as ‚ÄúPhiladelphia‚Äôs Studio 54.‚Äù Beasley Law Firm, Building History Although Second Story was a commercial success, Wayne's love of music compelled him to build another club‚Äîone that featured ‚Äúhardcore‚Äù dance music, then popular in after-hours gay juice bars. Later, this style of music was recognized as the precursor to house music, and Wayne's musical vision helped shape the dance genre Philly Classics. The Geftman brothers opened Catacombs in the fall of 1978 in the basement of the 12th Street structure. The club typically opened on Saturdays at midnight, and it would not close until Sunday around noon sometimes. The first record played at Catacombs was \\"The Impossible Dream\\". Although there has always been some confusion over who installed and designed the sound system in Catacombs, the truth is that it was the original sound system from the Music Box. Wayne updated the system by doubling the number of loudspeakers and amplifiers. Designed and installed by Donald Carucci, the modified system created a 360¬∞ field of sound, further enhanced by the club's low ceiling. The result was a sound system with crystal-clear music, in a room without dead spots. Catacombs earned a reputation as a nationally recognized after-hours club, and it became known for being frequented by music-industry professionals from both Philadelphia and New York. Catacombs' most significant contribution to the music industry was its creation of the dance genre Philly Classics. Catacombs closed its doors in December 1986.

The event was the fifteenth Guerra de Titanes end of the year show promoted by AAA since 1997. The event included appearances by Total Nonstop Action Wrestling (TNA) wrestlers A.J. Styles, D'Angelo Dinero, Gunner and Rob Terry as part of the ongoing storyline invasion of wrestlers from the American promotion. The pay-per-view was headlined by a match for the AAA Latin American Championship, between champion Dr. Wagner Jr. and challenger L.A. Park. The conclusion of the match led to the AAA debuts of M√°scara A√±o 2000 Jr., El Texano Jr. and Toscano, starting a new storyline, where the three posed as invaders from rival promotion Consejo Mundial de Lucha Libre (CMLL). Production =Background= Starting in 1997 the Mexican professional wrestling, company AAA has held a major wrestling show late in the year, either November or December, called Guerra de Titanes (\\"War of the Titans\\"). The show often features championship matches or Lucha de Apuestas or bet matches where the competitors risked their wrestling mask or hair on the outcome of the match. In Lucha Libre the Lucha de Apuetas match is considered more prestigious than a championship match and a lot of the major shows feature one or more Apuesta matches. The Guerra de Titanes show is hosted by a new location each year, emanating from cities such as Madero, Chihuahua, Chihuahua, Mexico City, Guadalajara, Jalisco and more. The 2011 Guerra de Titanes show was the fourteenth show in the series. =Storylines= The Guerra de Titanes show featured nine professional wrestling matches with different wrestlers involved in pre-existing, scripted feuds, plots, and storylines. Wrestlers were portrayed as either heels (referred to as rudos in Mexico, those that portray the \\"bad guys\\") or faces (t√©cnicos in Mexico, the \\"good guy\\" characters) as they followed a series of tension-building events, which culminated in a wrestling match or series of matches. Dr. Wagner Jr., the defending AAA Latin American Champion The long-running storyline rivalry between Dr. Wagner Jr. and L.A. Park, which had previously included teases for a Mask vs. Mask match at Tripleman√≠a XX, heated up again on November 5, when the two were involved in two brawls with each other. On November 26, Wagner Jr., who was accompanied to the match by his son El Hijo de Dr. Wagner Jr., Psycho Clown and El Zorro defeated Park, Nicho el Millonario and Octag√≥n in a six man tag team match via disqualification. After the match, Park attacked El Hijo de Dr. Wagner Jr., unmasking him and placing his mask over his own head. The attack led to Wagner Jr. accepting to defend the AAA Latin American Championship against Park at Guerra de Titanes, with his son in his corner. A.J. Styles After losing the AAA World Tag Team Championship to La Sociedad members Abyss and Chessman on October 9 at H√©roes Inmortales, AAA Cruiserweight Champion Jack Evans came back on November 14, picking up one of his biggest wins in AAA by cleanly pinning Los Perros del Mal leader El Hijo del Perro Aguayo in a tag team match, where he teamed with El Mes√≠as and Aguayo teamed up with Chessman. After the match, the two victors were attacked by H√©ctor Garza, who made his first AAA appearance in seven years, having recently left rival promotion Consejo Mundial de Lucha Libre (CMLL). On November 26, Evans pinned Aguayo in another tag team match, this time teaming with F√©nix, while Aguayo teamed with Halloween. Afterwards, both Evans and F√©nix were bloodied by Los Perros del Mal with F√©nix also having his mask torn to shreds. The attack led to F√©nix challenging Los Perros del Mal to a match at Guerra de Titanes. On December 1, Evans and F√©nix defeated Dark Dragon and H√©ctor Garza in Garza's AAA return match, after which Aguayo attacked Evans with a steel chair, bloodying him yet again, before being chased away by Drago, who made his return from an injury. On December 5 it was announced that at Guerra de Titanes, Drago, F√©nix and Evans would face Aguayo, Garza and Halloween in a six man tag team match. After H√©roes Inmortales, where AAA Mega Champion Jeff Jarrett's plan of using fellow Total Nonstop Action Wrestling (TNA) worker Sting to get rid of title contender El Mes√≠as had failed, Jarrett placed a $50,000 bounty on El Mes√≠as' head. This led to TNA wrestler Gunner making his AAA debut on November 26, attacking El Mes√≠as backstage. The attack was then used in storyline to explain El Mes√≠as inability to compete against Gunner. On December 5, it was announced that TNA wrestler A.J. Styles would be making his first appearance for AAA in five years at Guerra de Titanes, where he would face El Mes√≠as with the added stipulation that should El Mes√≠as be victorious, he would be named the number one contender to Jarrett's AAA Mega Championship. After turning on AAA and joining La Sociedad at H√©roes Inmortales, La Parka and Octag√≥n spent their first weeks as rudos explaining their turns. Parka blamed his turn on AAA for bringing back L.A. Park after his 15 years of loyal service, and the promotion's fans for choosing to root for both Park and Cibern√©tico over him during his past two rivalries, while Octag√≥n claimed that he was tired of AAA chief executive officer Joaqu√≠n Rold√°n's mismanagement of AAA and that his son, La Sociedad leader and AAA vice president Dorian Rold√°n's vision of AAA was closer to company founder Antonio Pe√±a's original vision of the promotion. La Parka then continued his rivalry with Cibern√©tico, while Octag√≥n was named the new leader of La Sociedad sub-group La Milicia, kicking out former leader Super Fly as his first act. On December 1, Dorian Rold√°n surprisingly announced that he had recruited Cibern√©tico into La Sociedad, however, Cibern√©tico ended up turning on the rudo group, finalizing his t√©cnico turn in the process. Following a run-in from Los Perros del Mal, Cibern√©tico was bloodied and eventually stretchered out of the arena. On December 5, AAA announced a six man tag team match between AAA loyalists Cibern√©tico, Electroshock and El Zorro and La Sociedad representatives La Parka, Octag√≥n and Silver King. Gunner At H√©roes Inmortales, Los Psycho Circus ended their year-long rivalry with Los Perros del Mal, defeating the rudo group in a steel cage Masks vs. Hair match, after Joe L√≠der attacked his former La Hermandad 187 partner Nicho el Millonario, who had turned on him the previous July. On November 26, L√≠der and Extreme Tiger challenged Abyss and Chessman for the AAA World Tag Team Championship, but were defeated when Nicho interfered, hitting L√≠der with a steel chair and throwing a fireball to Tiger's face. On December 1, Nicho defeated L√≠der in a street fight, following interference from Halloween, and burned his La Hermandad 187 gear afterwards. On December 5 it was announced that at Guerra de Titanes, Nicho and his Perros del Mal stablemate X-Fly would team up to take on L√≠der and Extreme Tiger in a flaming tables match. While Nicho and L√≠der were continuing their rivalry, Los Psycho Circus had moved on from Los Perros del Mal, now becoming more involved with AAA's battle with the rest of La Sociedad, especially invaders from the TNA promotion. On November 26, Monster Clown replaced an injured El Mes√≠as and took on TNA wrestler Gunner, losing the match following interference from La Sociedad members Konnan, Dark Dragon and Tito Santana. On December 5, AAA announced a six man tag team match for Guerra de Titanes between Los Psycho Circus and the team of Chessman and TNA wrestlers D'Angelo Dinero and Gunner, representing both La Sociedad and its sub-group La Legi√≥n Extranjera. At H√©roes Inmortales, exotico Cassandro returned to AAA after a three and a half year absence, saving AAA Reina de Reinas Champion Pimpinela Escarlata, who had for the past months suffered several beatdowns at the hands of fellow exoticos Nygma, Pasi√≥n Cristal, Polvo de Estrellas and Yuriko, who had grouped together through their jealousy of Escarlata's success. On November 5, Cassandro and Escarlata were joined by El Brazo, who debuted his exotico persona \\"La Braza\\", leveling the playing field in the battle between the t√©cnico and rudo groups. On December 5 it was announced that at Guerra de Titanes, Pimpinela Escarlata would defend the Reina de Reinas Championship against La Sociedad member Sexy Star in a lumberjack match. The November 14 event in Irapuato, Guanajuato, saw not only the AAA return of H√©ctor Garza, but also another former CMLL worker, Mini- Estrella (midget wrestler) Mascarita Dorada, who made his first appearance for the promotion in four years. On November 30, it was announced that Dorada would wrestle his return match at Guerra de Titanes, teaming with Mascarita Divina and Octag√≥ncito against AAA World Mini-Estrella Champion Mini Psicosis, Mini Chessman and Mini Histeria in a six man tag team match. Event =Preliminary matches= D'Angelo Dinero The opening match of Guerra de Titanes featured the AAA Mini-Estrellas, with Mascarita Divina, Mascarita Dorada and Octag√≥ncito taking on Mini Chessman, Mini Histeria and Mini Psicosis. The t√©cnico team won the match, after Mascarita Divina and Octag√≥ncito took out Mini Histeria and Mini Chessman with suicide dives, after which Mascarita Dorada pinned AAA World Mini-Estrella Champion Mini Psicosis with a double springboard moonsault. After the match, Octag√≥ncito took the house microphone and announced how ashamed he was Octag√≥n recent behaviour. This led to Octag√≥n coming out, confronting and eventually attacking his mini version. The second match featured Pimpinela Escarlata defending the AAA Reina de Reinas Championship against Sexy Star in a lumberjack match. As opposed to what was being advertised prior to the event, Escarlata was accompanied to the ring by La Braza, not Cassandro, while Sexy Star was accompanied by La Legi√≥n Extranjera leader Konnan. The lumberjacks for the match included El Apache, Mascarita Divina, Mascarita Dorada, Mini Chessman, Mini Histeria, Mini Psicosis, Nygma, Pasi√≥n Cristal and Polvo de Estrellas. Towards the end of the match, Cristal illegally entered the ring, but was taken out by Escarlata. As referee Copetes Salazar was trying to get Cristal out of the ring, Escarlata leapt off his back to dropkick Sexy Star. When Salazar confronted Escarlata on the move, Escarlata answered by kissing him. As Salazar was trying to recover, Konnan entered the ring with a baseball bat covered in barbed wire, but dropped the bat after being kissed by La Braza. Sexy Star took advantage of the distraction, hit Escarlata in the back with the bat and then pinned him with a schoolboy to become the new Reina de Reinas Champion, starting her second reign as the champion. In the third match, Extreme Tiger and Joe L√≠der took on Los Perros del Mal representatives Nicho el Millonario and X-Fly in a Flaming Tables match. To win the match, a wrestler had to be put through a flaming table. In the end, L√≠der lit a table on fire, but when he went to put X-Fly through it with a Spanish Fly, he caught only the edge of the table and did not break it, managing only to kill the flame. Tiger then lit another table on fire and put Nicho through it with a super hurricanrana for the win. The fourth match saw Chessman teaming with TNA wrestlers D'Angelo Dinero and Gunner against Los Psycho Circus. After Los Psycho Circus managed to isolate Dinero from his partners, Monster Clown lifted him up to Murder Clown sitting on the top rope, who then dropped him down to the mat with a superbomb for the win. After the match, the Gunner attacked the clowns and was setting Monster Clown for a move, before being chased out of the ring by Murder and Psycho Clown. Cibern√©tico In the fifth match of the pay-per-view, Ej√©rcito AAA members Cibern√©tico, Electroshock and El Zorro took on La Sociedad members La Parka, Octag√≥n and Silver King. Electroshock and Silver King were accompanied to the match by their midget companions, Lokillo and Maniaquito, respectively. The rudos took control of the match with steel chairs and a run-in from Tigre Cota and Tito Santana, members of Octag√≥n's La Milicia. Eventually Cibern√©tico mounted a comeback and performed a stunner on his longtime rival, La Parka. Electroshock then entered the ring and hit a cutter on Octag√≥n, after which El Zorro hit Parka, Santana, Cota and Silver King with his kendo stick. Finally, Cibern√©tico re-entered the ring and pinned Silver King for the win with a Garra Cibernetica. After the match, the rudos attacked the victors, with La Parka beating Cibern√©tico with a steel chair, before being chased out of the ring by members of his Los Bizarros group. =Main event matches= In the sixth match El Mes√≠as took on TNA wrestler A.J. Styles in an attempt to earn a shot at the AAA Mega Championship. Towards the end of the match, Styles set up for his finishing maneuver, Styles Clash, but El Mes√≠as got out of it and hit a spear. Styles then came back with a Pel√©, but when he went for the Superman, El Mes√≠as blocked it with his knees. After a double knee backbreaker and a Mes√≠as Splash, El Mes√≠as scored the three count to become the number one contender to the title held by Jeff Jarrett. After the match, Dorian Rold√°n and Konnan appeared and informed the exhausted El Mes√≠as that he had been booked in another match, which led to TNA wrestler Rob Terry making his entrance to start the match. With help from a steel chair, Terry dominated the match early on, but eventually El Mes√≠as managed to turn the tables and sent Terry onto a steel chair placed in the corner. This was followed by El Mes√≠as pinning Terry with a schoolboy for his second victory of the night. After the match, Terry attacked El Mes√≠as, but was quickly taken down by Dark Cuervo and Dark Ozz, who made their return from a tour of All Japan Pro Wrestling (AJPW). However, Cuervo and Ozz were then themselves overpowered by D'Angelo Dinero and Gunner, which led to El Vampiro Canadiense making his first AAA appearance in a year and chasing them out of the ring. Vampiro took the house microphone and proclaimed his hate for Konnan and his loyalty to AAA, while also apologizing to Joaqu√≠n Rold√°n for his past behaviour. Roldan made an appearance to accept the apology and welcome Vampiro back to the promotion. The segment ended with El Mes√≠as announcing that he whether Jarrett liked it or not, he was going to bring the AAA Mega Championship back to Mexico sooner or later. The eighth match of the evening featured Drago, F√©nix and Jack Evans continuing their rivalry with Los Perros del Mal, represented by Halloween, H√©ctor Garza and El Hijo del Perro Aguayo. The match was built around the rivalry between Aguayo and Evans with both men bleeding early on, after busting each other open. Towards the end of the match, Aguayo performed a Lanza on Evans, while F√©nix pounced on Garza with a standing moonsault. As F√©nix was setting for a moonsault from the top rope, Aguayo hit him in the back with a steel chair, after which Garza dropped him to the mat with an inverted superplex. Garza then hit F√©nix with a package facebuster, which was enough for a three count and a win. During Los Perros del Mal's post-match celebration, Halloween unmasked F√©nix. L.A. Park, the new AAA Latin American Champion The final match of the evening saw Dr. Wagner Jr. defending the AAA Latin American Championship against L.A. Park. Wagner Jr. was accompanied to the ring by his son, while Park was accompanied by Octag√≥n. Before the start of the match, Toscano, another former CMLL, who had recently left the promotion, made an appearance and declared that \\"they\\" were better than AAA, raising the ire of Wagner Jr. After being punched down by Wagner, Toscano was carried out of the arena by members of the AAA security crew. During the early part of the brawl, the competitors tore each other's masks apart. While Park distracted the referee Copetes Salazar, Octag√≥n entered the ring to attack Wagner Jr. This led to Octag√≥ncito making an appearance and attacking Octag√≥n. When Wagner Jr. his Park with a sitout powerbomb, the rudo Salazar refused to perform a three count, faking an arm injury. Salazar then attempted to pull Wagner off Park, but was accidentally hit by a dive from Park. Wagner performed a La Casita on Park, but there was no referee to make the count. As Wagner was trying to wake Salazar up, Park hit him with a low blow. When a replaced referee, Piero, ran to the ring, Park performed a double knee gutbuster, but after it resulted in only a two count, Park took out his frustration on Piero, throwing him out of the ring. Wagner then hit Park with a DDT and a top rope double knee facebreaker, but again there was no referee to make the count. Octag√≥n then threw brass knuckles to Park, which led to El Hijo de Dr. Wagner Jr. entering to ring to clothesline him. Octag√≥n then entered the ring and attacked El Hijo de Dr. Wagner Jr., but was quickly taken out himself by Wagner Jr.'s Wagner Driver. In the commotion, Park got his hands on the brass knuckles, hit Wagner Jr. with them and pinned him to become the new AAA Latin American Championship, after Copetes Salazar performed a fast count. After the match, Toscano re-entered the arena and attacked the Wagners along with M√°scara A√±o 2000 Jr. and El Texano Jr., two more former CMLL wrestlers, all wearing shirts that read \\"El Consejo\\". Meanwhile, L.A. Park received his title belt and left the ring unharmed by the invaders. El Texano Jr. then took the house microphone and challenged both AAA and La Sociedad, before the trio was chased out of the ring by Los Psycho Circus. Aftermath On December 20, at AAA's final television tapings of 2011, El Consejo established themselves as the third major group, outside of both AAA and La Sociedad, by doing several run-in attacks on not only AAA loyalists Argenis, Atomic Boy, F√©nix and Los Psycho Circus, but also La Sociedad members Halloween and Octag√≥n, while once again leaving L.A. Park unharmed. With Park, Konnan, Dorian Rold√°n and Joaqu√≠n Rold√°n all claiming that they had nothing to do with El Consejo arriving to the promotion, Konnan came to the conclusion that one of them was lying. On January 21, 2012, Mortiz and Semental, both former CMLL wrestlers who had jumped to AAA in June 2011, joined El Consejo, becoming the group's fourth and fifth member.

French career Pha√©ton was stationed at Hellevoetsluis under the command of lieutenant de vaisseau Saulces de Freycinet. Between 7 September and 16 October 1805, she conducted a patrol in the North Sea. Shortly thereafter the French Navy dispatched her to the Antilles on a mission.Fonds Marine, p.322, & 356.

Capture The next day, on 26 March, , under the command of Captain Charles B.H. Ross, was sailing from Santo Domingo to Curacoa when she encountered two French navy brigs. At 1pm, Pique began firing at long range, and by 2pm had caught up with them. After an intensive cannonade that lasted some 20 minutes, Pique was able to send a boarding aboard one of the two French vessels. A terrible struggle ensued before the French vessel struck. The French crew had concealed themselves under sails and in the wreckage, emerging once the boarding party arrived and subjecting it to a devastating fusillade that killed or wounded most of the boarding party. Ross then sent over more men, before returning to the chase of the second brig.James (1837), Vol. 4, pp. 226-7. After the exchange of several more broadsides, the second French vessel struck. The two vessels turned out to be Pha√©ton and Voltigeur, having crews of 120 men and 115 men. Voltigeur was under the command of lieutenant de vaisseau M. St. Craig. Pique had one man wounded during the chase, and nine men killed and 13 wounded during the boarding of Pha√©ton. Ross estimated that the French vessels had lost half their crews dead and wounded. Later reports suggested that although French casualties on Phaeton had been heavy, those on Voltigeur were slight. The British took Pha√©ton into service as Mignonne, and Voltigeur as Pelican. British service The British commissioned Mignonne under Commander Robert Nicholson. In August Commander George Gustavus Lennox replaced Nicholas. The Admiralty then renamed her HMS Musette and in October 1807 Commander Peter Douglas took command. In 1808 Commander Henry Boys replaced Douglas. In 1809 Commander J. Lloyd assumed command. In December Commander Thomas P.J. Parry replaced Lloyd. He sailed her to Britain and she arrived at Portsmouth on 30 June 1810. There she was placed in ordinary. Fate The Admiralty offered Musette for sale at Portsmouth on 9 June 1814. She was finally sold on 1 September 1814 for ¬£400.

The film contained several full nude scenes. The film is regarded as anticlerical, and the nudity was justified by its religious context. Plot The film follows the parallel stories of an early Christian ascetic and a modern minister, with most actors in dual roles. Gabriel (Courteney Foote) is a medieval monk who devotes himself to completing a statue of ‚ÄúTruth,‚Äù only to be murdered by a mob when his work turns out to be an image of a naked woman. The contemporary Gabriel is the pastor of a large wealthy urban congregation for whom religion is a matter of appearances, not beliefs. The hypocrisy of the congregation is exposed by a series of vignettes in which the Naked Truth, literally portrayed by a nude Margaret Edwards, reveals their appetites for money, sex and power. Cast * Courtenay Foote - Gabriel, the Ascetic * Myrtle Stedman - The Woman * Herbert Standing - The Abbot * Adele Farrington - The Queen * Margaret Edwards - The Naked Truth * Charles Villiers - the Minister * Vera Lewis - Parishioner(*uncredited) Reception Hypocrites was a shocking and controversial film whose release was held up for many months by the difficulty of distributing a film with full nudity. Weber‚Äôs sincerity and reputation allowed her to use something that in the hands of a male director would have been considered scandalous and immoral. The film was passed by the British Board of Film Censors. However, because of the full and recurring nudity through the film, it caused riots in New York City, was banned in Ohio, and was subject to censorship in Boston when the mayor demanded that the film negatives be painted over to clothe the woman. Hypocrites and the technique was widely admired at the time for its extraordinary use of multiple exposures and intricate editing, and propelled Weber to the front ranks of silent directors. The use in the film of traveling double exposure sequences of the woman is considered impressive for 1915. Most of the film has survived, though some scenes have suffered from some serious nitrate decomposition in places especially at the beginning and cannot be restored. A print of the film is kept in the Library of Congress.

The Yavapai also participated on the side of the Hualapai and Mohave scouts were employed by the United States Army. Following the death of the prominent Yavapai leader Anasa in April 1865, the natives began raiding American settlements which provoked a response by the United States Army forces stationed in the area. By the spring of 1869 disease forced the majority of the Hualapais to surrender though some skirmishing continued for almost two more years.Hualapai War (1865-1868)- Accessed 2012-02-11fort tours- Accessed 2012-02-11 War Tensions between the Hualapai people and settlers began with encroachment of Indian lands. The Hualapai lived in the area between the Grand Canyon and the Bill Williams River. In 1857 Edward Fitzgerald Beale carved a road through Hualapai territory, leading to Needles, California, and in 1863, gold was discovered in the Prescott Valley. The gold rush brought a steady flow of miners and other settlers to the area so in 1864 Captain William Hardy built a toll road through Hualapai territory between Prescott and Bull Head City, which was then known as Hardyville. The road later spread out, leading to other places such as Fort Mohave and the Colorado River ports. Relations with the natives were generally peaceful and Hardy was able to acquire a fortune by building a ferry across the Colorado River and by taxing the settlers who used his road. However, in April 1865, drunken settlers killed Anasa during a meeting which led the Yavapai to wage war. The Hualapai called on their Havasupai and Yavapai allies to help them fight and they accepted, warriors under Chief Leve Leve (half-brother to Sherum and Hualapai Charley, both Chiefs of the Middle Mountain People subtribe) of the Amat Whala Pa'a (Mad hwa:la Ba:' ‚Äì \\"Hualapai Mountains band\\") of the Yavapai Fighters subtribe assembled.often Leve Leve is mistaken for a Yavapai leader ‚Äì but he is actually only a band leader of the Yavapai Fighters subtribe, which were named for their fighting against the enemy Yavapai In all there were about 250 Hualapai warriors, and an unknown number of Yavapai and Apache allies, facing hundreds of United States Army troops and militia. At the time, there was no distinction between the Yavapai and the Western Apache people. Due to their close relationship with tribes such as the Tonto Apache, the word Yavapai was not then in use so the Yavapai was considered as Tonto Apaches, or Apache-Mohaves.Utley, pg. 255 The actual fighting took the form of guerrilla warfare, in which small bands of natives cut off Hardy's road and raided using hit and run tactics. It was not until Captain Hardy negotiated a peace treaty with the Hualapai at Camp Beale's Spring that the raids were ceased. Nine months later, during another meeting with the Hualapai chiefs, settlers killed Wauba Yuma which renewed the hostilities.Mohave museum- Accessed 2012-02-11Indian war battles- Accessed 2012-02-11Broder, pg. 70-72 Men of the 8th Cavalry Regiment, from Fort Whipple, and men of the 14th Infantry Regiment, under William Redwood Price, responded by counter raiding into Hualapai territory. The soldiers fought several small battles with the natives and burned many of their rancher√≠as. They also built posts, including Camp Date Creek, in January 1867, and Camp Hualapai, in May 1869. Camp Date Creek was located along Date Creek and the road between Prescott and La Paz. Camp Hualapai was located north of Prescott, southeast of Aztec Pass, along Walnut Creek and Captain Hardy's toll road. Both of the posts greatly improved the military's ability to defeat the natives but disease would conquer the Hualapai first. The war is generally recorded as having ended in December 1868 due to an outbreak of dysentery and whooping cough that caused many of the natives to surrender, however, Chief Leve Leve did not surrender until 1869 and Chief Sherum continued to lead his followers until 1870. Many of the Hualapais were moved to a reservation at Camp Beale's Spring but three years later moved to the Colorado River Reservation near La Paz. Some went to a temporary reservation at Camp Date Creek but by 1874 the post was closed. Conditions at the reservations led to starvation and disease so in 1875 some of the Hualapai escaped to their traditional lands, only to find that it had already been settled by others. The Hualapais then either went back to the reservation or took up work in mines or on ranches. In 1882, a 900,000 acre reservation was established for the Hualapai but it was described as poor land, either because of weather, or from the ranchers whose cattle destroyed many of the indigenous plants that were vital to the Hualapais' source of food. It is estimated that one-third of the Hualapai population was lost between 1865 and 1870.Arizona forts- Accessed 2012-02-11Legends of America- Accessed 2012-02-11Broder, pg. 70-72 See also *Apache Wars *Yavapai Wars *Navajo Wars Notes References Category:History of Arizona Category:American frontier Category:Wars involving the United States Category:1860s in the United States Category:Conflicts in 1865 Category:Conflicts in 1866 Category:Conflicts in 1867 Category:Conflicts in 1868 Category:Conflicts in 1869 Category:Conflicts in 1870 Category:19th- century military history of the United States Category:Wars fought in Arizona Category:Indian wars of the American Old West ","title":"Hualapai War"},{"id":"33046855","text":"Such a Little Queen is a 1921 American silent film drama starring Constance Binney and directed by George Fawcett, who usually appeared in front of the camera as a character actor.

LibreOffice Base was built off of a fork of OpenOffice.org and was first released as version 3.4.0.1 on October 4, 2011. Similarly to the other packages in the LibreOffice suite, Base is supported across multiple platforms including Microsoft Windows, macOS, and Linux. Base is recognized for its cross-platform compatibility relative to Microsoft Access, which is developed exclusively for Windows. Features LibreOffice Base is designed to allow users to easily create, access, modify, and view databases and their data. This is done by providing users with a graphical user interface that allows users to work with four main tools: Tables, queries, forms, and reports. Base includes software wizards to assist users with various aspects of the program. Creating Table in Libreoffice Base Base is able to work with both embedded and external database files. Embedded databases are stored as a single file using C++ based Firebird and Java-based HSQLDB as its storage engine. When connecting to external databases, Base acts as a graphical user interface front-end to facilitate interactions with various database systems, including Microsoft Access databases (JET), ODBC/JDBC data sources, MySQL, MariaDB, and PostgreSQL. Base has been described as an unusual project in the niche of database management system software, which tends toward proprietary software designed for enterprise users. Proprietary database management software costs have been described as a reason for the use of Base in small businesses. Migration From HSQLDB to Firebird Work was started in 2014 to transition the embedded storage engine from HSQLDB to the Firebird SQL back-end. Firebird has been included in LibreOffice as an experimental option since LibreOffice 4.2. In August 2018, The Document Foundation announced the release of LibreOffice version 6.1. If the experimental mode is used, the embedded Firebird engine support is fully available, and the old HSQLDB engine is deprecated‚Äîalthough still available‚Äîand replaced by Firebird as the default option. In February 2019, The Document Foundation released LibreOffice version 6.2. The embedded Firebird engine support was moved from experimental mode to operational and the Firebird Migration Assistant can create a backup copy of content as an XML document for the migration process.

Their music incorporates elements of reggae, hip-hop, pop, and indie. History The Holdup formed initially when drummer Danny Flores and guitarist Tyler Scurti added vocalist Mike Garmany in the autumn of 2006. A second lineup was formed by Danny Flores (drums), Tyler Scurti (guitar), and Mike Garmany (lead vocals/guitar) in 2007 after recruiting Kyle Christensen (bass guitar). When the band began performing their original songs at local venues around San Jose, a fan base developed for their multi-genre music. As demand for an album began to increase the band recruited Clev Stiles as DJ and band manager. Their first EP quickly sold one thousand copies in the summer of 2008. A few weeks later the band signed with local independent record label, Dub Rock, and began production on their first album, Stay Gold. Once released, Stay Gold debuted at the #1 spot on the iTunes Reggae Charts. Due to the album's success on iTunes, it was featured on the ‚ÄúWhat‚Äôs Hot‚Äù list for six weeks. After a successful first album, The Holdup went back into the studio to create their sophomore record, Confidence in 2010. The song ‚ÄúFaster‚Äù adds a hip-hop style by incorporating an up-tempo beat and quick delivery by vocalist Garmany. ‚ÄúMotion‚Äù is an acoustic sound with heartfelt lyrics, providing musical diversity to the album. Confidence debuted at #1 on the iTunes Reggae Charts and earned the band the award of iTunes Best New Reggae Artist of 2010. The Holdup produced a third album in 2011, Still Gold. Prior to its release, a half cover of \\"Young Folks\\" by Peter Bjorn and John, renamed by The Holdup as \\"Young Fools\\", entered the music mainstream. While the third album was in postproduction, iTunes recognized the band's talent once more by placing their song \\"Summertime Baby\\", off of the album Confidence, on the iTunes Essentials Rising Stars: Reggae playlist that was released on March 28, 2011. Still Gold was launched on April 26, 2011 and debuted at #1 on the iTunes Reggae Charts. It also earned the #2 spot on the Billboard Charts: Reggae Albums. The band released their fourth album on May 18, 2012, Consequence. A single, \\"Real With You\\" was released November 7, 2012, for free on the Dub Rock Records website. On October 15, 2013, they released their first single from their album, Fools Gold, Pt. I, called \\"IHTST\\" (an abbreviation of \\"I Hate The Summer Time\\"), available on iTunes. Fools Gold Pt. 1, was released on December 6, 2013. In promotion for their newest album, The Holdup released two singles, \\"Let's Get High\\" and a demo version of \\"Have a Good Summer\\" on SoundCloud. They then officially released both songs, with a finished version of \\"Have a Good Summer\\" on iTunes. On May 12, 2014, The Holdup officially announced via their Facebook page that their newest album was to be called H.A.G.S. (an acronym for \\"Have a good summer\\"), and on August 4, it was revealed to be an EP. H.A.G.S. - EP was released on August 26, 2014.

Funeral at Brookwood Cemetery to- morrow (Saturday)....\\") was a British colonial administrator who was Governor of the Gold Coast (1898‚Äì1900), Barbados (1900‚Äì04) and British Guiana (1904‚Äì11). Early years Hodgson was the son of the Reverend Octavius Arthur Hodgson, Rector of East Stoke, Dorset, England. He joined the General Post Office, and worked in the Savings Bank department between 1868 and 1869. He was Postmaster General of British Guiana from 1882 to 1888.British Badge Forum, quoting Black & White Budget, 1900: \\"Sir Frederick Mitchell Hodgson: Born 1851; son of the Rev.

Sir Frederick died in 1925.\\" Gold Coast Hodgson was appointed Colonial Secretary of Gold Coast from 1888 to 1898. In 1892 he raised the Gold Coast Rifle Volunteers, and was Major commanding this force. Hodgson was Governor and Commander in Chief of Gold Coast from 1898 to 1900. He was appointed K.C.M.G. on 3 June 1899.Shaw, William Arthur, The Knights of England: A Complete Record from the Earliest Time to the Present Day of the Knights of All the Orders of Chivalry in England, Scotland, and Ireland, and of Knights Bachelors, \\"St. Michael and St. George - 1899, June 3. Frederick Mitchell Hidgson, governor and commander-on-chief of the Gold Coast colony\\", p. 389. The 1896 British expedition against the Ashanti led by Sir Francis Scott had entered Kumasi and forced King Prempeh to submit, with all his treasures being seized except the Golden Stool of Ashanti, which had been hidden. The Golden Stool was said to be an immense throne of solid gold. The other treasures were taken to London, where they were greatly admired for their artistic workmanship. When the Asante demanded more political autonomy and the return of Prempeh, who had been banished, Hodgson justified British rule on the grounds that autonomy would lead to a return to the traffic in slaves. In 1899 Hodgson sent his private secretary, Captain Armitage, on a secret expedition to find the Golden Stool. The expedition succeeded only in arousing the suspicions of the Asante. Hodgson summoned the Asante chiefs to an assembly at Kumasi held on 28 March 1900.ARHIN Brempong, \\"The role of Nana Yaa Asantewaa in the 1900 Asante War of Resistance\\", Le Griot, Vol. VIII, 2000. He asked them: \\"What must I do to the man, whoever he is, who has failed to give to the Queen, who is the paramount power in the country, the stool to which she is entitled? Where is the Golden Stool? Why am I not sitting on the Golden Stool at this moment? I am the representative of the paramount power in this country; why have you relegated me to this chair? Why did you not take the opportunity of my coming to Kumasi to bring the Golden Stool and give it to me to sit upon?\\" The chiefs listened in silence, then went home to prepare for war. Hodgson found himself besieged in the fort at Kumasi. The fort was impregnable to Asante weapons, and defended by machine guns and artillery in the fort's turrets. On 15 May a force of 170 African soldiers and three British officers reached the fort after marching 238 miles from the north, bringing food and ammunition. A relief expedition was dispatched from the coast, but moved slowly. The Asante constructed massive barricades of logs, dirt and stones across the roads, strong enough to be impervious to artillery fire, with fortified and entrenched flanks. After help had finally arrived, Hodgson managed to break out and reached Cape Coast Castle by July 1900, leaving a small garrison behind. Some lives were lost in the escape. His wife, Lady Mary Alice Hodgson, n√©e Young, who was the first English lady to visit Ashanti, wrote The Siege of Kumassi an account of the siege and of the subsequent march to the coast. Sir Frederick was appointed Governor of Barbados, succeeded by Major Matthew Nathan. On 26 September 1901 the Ashanti kingdom was formally annexed by Britain. Queen Yaa Asantewaa's forces were defeated on 30 September and she was captured soon after. Future British administrators were more tactful than Hodgson, and eventually Prempeh was restored to his throne and sat again on the Golden Stool. Later career Hodgson was Governor and Commander in Chief of Barbados from late 1900 to 1904 . He was Governor of British Guiana from 1904 to 1911. In August 1904 Hodgson had to deal with an incident in which the Venezuelan authorities had arrested some miners whom they claimed had strayed across the border from Guiana. The men were released, but Hodgson made it clear that his government would not in future assist miners who violated Venezuelan laws. In 1905, Hodgson intervened with sugar plantation owners in Guiana, persuading them to reverse wage increases. He was concerned that such increases would cause \\"trouble\\" throughout the colonial sugar industry. At the end of November 1905 dock workers in Georgetown went on strike for higher wages, and began rioting and looting stores. On 1 December, Hodgson met with members of the Georgetown City Council who had agreed to represent the strikers. He addressed a large crowd, promising to investigate their grievances if they would disperse. The rioters refused, and over the next three days disturbances continued. Two warships arrived on 4 December with a contingent of soldiers who restored calm. In the aftermath several hundred people were arrested and charged, with some being flogged and others spending time in jail. No wage increase was granted. Hodgson caused some controversy in April 1908 when he invited Sir Joseph Godfrey, the District Grand Master of the Masonic Lodge, Surgeon General, and a leading member of the Executive Council, to lay the foundation stone of the new Carnegie Library building in Georgetown.Inderjeet Beharry, \\"Short History of the development of English Freemasonry in Guyana 1780 ‚Äì 2004\\" , paper presented to Heritage Lodge at the Annual Banquet, Scarborough Masonic Temple, January 29, 2005. The Roman Catholics strongly objected, but the governor went ahead. On 23 December 1911 Hodgson was appointed an officer of the new masonic lodge called the Royal Colonial Institute. In June 1910 Hodgson ordered that the small island of Kyk-Over-Al, at the junction of the Mazaruni and Cuyuni Rivers, be cleared of its overgrowth. This revealed the remains of a Dutch fort from the late 16th century, including stone ramparts and brick pavements and relics such as bottles and clay pipes. The modern relevance was that it established the British claim to the island as successors to the Dutch. Hodgson died in London, aged 73, in 1925.
