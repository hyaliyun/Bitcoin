Ch√¢teau de la Motte is a chateau located in the commune of Jou√©-du-Plain (Orne) in Normandy, France. The chateau began as a Viking Motte-and-bailey castle and evolved into the 18th- and 19th-century Chateau seen today. The two most noted families who owned the site were the Gabriel Montgommerys and the Nicolas Angos, but its role as Resistance center in World War II may be its most notable episode. Long established Norman chateaus, like Ch√¢teau de la Motte, usually originate from motte-and-bailey castles constructed during the earliest Norman period in the 10th and 11th centuries. The bourgeois Ango family built much of Ch√¢teau de la Motte in the late 16th and early 18th century. They bought the original chateau from one of the most noted names in Normandy: the descendants of Gabriel de Montgomery I (Montgommery). In 1559, Montgomery had accidentally killed King Henry II of France in a joust. Ch√¢teau de la Motte sits at the end of a long chestnut tree alley or avenue linking to the commune of Jou√©-du- Plain and the village of √âcouch√©. The chateau's former farm, with an arched entry and coat-of-arms may have been the original chateau built in the 1660s. Today's chateau and a number of buildings have dates from the early 1820s, after restorations from the Deschamps family following the French Revolution. In the Second World War, the chateau operated as a dairy and holiday home for Paris prostitutes. However, at the same time it functioned as headquarters for the Resistance. Escaping Allied pilots and an important arms depot were hidden here. The discovery of the depot by the Germans led to the assassination of the local mayor, and an unresolved crime, the subject of two criminal investigations and one book. Name, water sources and first historic mention 19th-century rendition of a motte-and-bailey castle Ch√¢teau de la Motte takes its name from the small-forested rise next to the current house, called a motte (\\"clod of earth\\" in Old French). The small mound is the remains of a Viking/Norman motte-and-bailey castle (motte castrale, motte f√©odale in Old French). Mottes were made throughout France and Europe from the 10th century until the early 13th century, with many sites carrying the title of La Motte, Les Mottes, For√™t de la Motte, or Ch√¢teau de la Motte. =Site and water sources= Mottes often sat on Roman villa sites because water sources and strategic location needs were the same in both eras. Although numerous villa ruins were found nearby with the recent A88 autoroute construction, it is unknown whether this site was occupied before the Vikings, absent archaeological excavation. The Chateau's site, including orchard and farm, has seven sources of water. Like most chateaus and mottes, this was likely the main consideration for the location. Wells and water management were important from earlier times as most drinking sources were contaminated, and sufficient water for animals was critical, even in rain-soaked Normandy. Water pollution was a known source of sickness from antiquity onward, although poorly understood. In the 15th century, when chateaus lost their defensive function, moats fulfilled prestige and aesthetic roles as well as providing fishponds, an important source of protein for peasants. =First historic mention= The first mention of Ch√¢teau de la Motte is a letter from Guillame Lesor in 1217, asking to be a vassal of the French King. This letter followed the loss by King John of England (1199‚Äì1216) at the Battle of Bouvines in 1214, forcing an English withdrawal from Normandy. Evolution The first motte and bailey forts were built to defend Viking/Norman power in Normandy, as the lords of Maine in the south, and Brittany, to the west, occasionally intruded in force. The river Orne was the southernmost Norman boundary for much of the 10th century, and was defended by a series of mottes, usually in groups. Motte and bailey castles usually had two main parts, both surrounded by wet or dry moats, then a wooden palisade. First constructed was the motte, or earthmound topped by a wooden tower. The tower was a last defense in an attack, and sometimes the lord's residence. The bailey contained barns, barracks, blacksmithy, chapel and other support structures. A removable wooden bridge linked the tower to the courtyard and a single fortified gate welcomed the visitor crossing the moat. The motte may have been similar to one excavated nearby at Land de Goult, near Carrouges. Archeologists uncovered a lower court across. The motte was across at the base, with a flattened top for the tower high and wide at the top. After William the Conqueror's death, his sons revived motte making in the area to consolidate power from nearby Ch√¢teau de Falaise and Argentan. Lords continued building motte and bailey castles in the region throughout the ongoing feudal anarchy, until the mid-12th century. Thus, Ch√¢teau de la Motte may have originated close the letter's date of 1217. =Tower and circle walls= In the 11th century a large stone tower (fr.grosses tour, grande tour, or tour ma√Ætresse) was sometimes built over a water source, and the support buildings lined inside were attached to its circular wall. Stone for these structures would have been fieldstone and not cut; however, much of the structures may have been wood, or wattle and dab, not stone. Like mottes, most exterior wooden walls would have been coated in plaster to reduce fire worries, and making them resemble stone buildings. =Fortified farm= Ch√¢teau de la Motte, like most small chateaus, was most probably little more than a farm, possibly fortified during the Middle Ages. The king, or the duke of Normandy, had to give permission for building fortifications; towers, moats, and crenellations required licenses. Instead, rural architecture evolved a defensive function with buildings in compounds, built around a courtyard with water. The exterior walls had few windows, with an easy-to-defend entrance. Careful orientation toward the south, like most country architecture in France, was moderated on the Atlantic coast, in order to block the storms from the southwest. Today's gatehouse or dependence protects the chateau from the weather as well. The walls surrounding the grounds created microclimates, as well as defense, as intended. The rooftops deflect the winds upward, away from the residence. The lord's dwelling would have been a modest structure from the 11th to 16th centuries, even if the home were referred to as a Great Hall (la grande salle). The home would have at least two levels with storage on the ground floor and a large public room (l'aula) on the first floor, which was the actual great hall. This hall would have been a judicial, political, and economic center for the community, or parish (now commune), and located near the entrance to the chateau grounds. A lord's private chamber (la camera) would have been at one end, with true privacy only in the large curtained bed. The chapel (la capella) was typically near, or in, the home, but no site is known today. During the Middle Ages, a lord's family usually moved between their various lands and residences, leaving the maintenance and farm production to a permanent staff. It was sort of a mandatory, perpetual picnic. A noble household consisted of an extended family including many illegitimate half brothers and sisters, along with descendants from previous mixed offspring. A mother's status determined the roles in the family, with many positions as administrators and servants. Strategic marriages with other families were sought to defend the family's power and prestige, but a lord's daughter by other than his wife could marry a high servant. Sons were expected to leave the family for service in other lords‚Äô homes. A modest chateau had between 10 and 20 servants: farm and household staff such as shepherds, ditchers, cow herders, milkmaids, and cooks. Most pay was in-kind, such as food and clothes. Regardless of the construction, probably no comfortable home existed at Ch√¢teau de la Motte until the 17th century. King Henry IV visited the region in 1579, and stayed in an inn five kilometers away in √âcouch√©, because there was no place suitable for him nearby. With the inspiration of Versailles, ch√¢teaux de chasse (hunting chateaus/lodges) became popular as country retreats, with the hunt as the theme. These chateaus featured grand architecture, beautiful gardens, select majestic and exotic trees, greenhouses (orangeries) for luxuriant smells and spices, and grand entrances. A Google Earth view of the chateau reveals an ancient hedge-line, or tree alley, leading from the current Chateau's gates to the Forest of la Motte (bois de la motte). The existing majestic lime trees (tilleul) near the house and ponds may have been originals or descendants of those planted by previous lords as limes gave prestige and the grandeur of shade. Traditionally they were often planted in the courtyards center as symbols of high justice. Lords, owners and major events Norman nobility originated as loyal friends and family of William the Conqueror. In turn, their knights and retainers became minor nobles (la petite noblesse), usually barons, which filled out the need for local authority and management. Early Ch√¢teau la Motte lords probably were among these nobles. The known owners are taken from the original charter, which existed at the time of the writing of the book, Histoire du bourg d'√âcouch√© By Alfred Caix in 1867. * 1217 - domain of Guillaume Lesor, first known use of the chateau's name in a letter requesting vassalage to King Phillipe Auguste of France, after the English King John Lackland (1199‚Äì1216) lost the Battle of Bouvines in 1214 and withdrew from Normandy. * 1357 ‚Äì Nearby Argentan burned and pillaged by the English during the Hundred Years' War. * 1417 - September 21 letter from Fralin de la Motte asking for the protection of the French king. This was probably the result of King Henry V's second invasion of Normandy in July 1417, and the fall of nearby Caen on September 8. The region remained under English control until 1449. Note: in Old French, Fralin is a term meaning a farmer of a large parcel of land. * 1553 ‚Äì Catherine Lelievre left Ch√¢teau de la Motte to her daughter Fran√ßoise, who married Balthazar de Villers and they had a daughter Louise. * 1554, 1586 and 1588 ‚Äì The Black Death and several Protestant armies ravaged the region during the Wars of Religion. * 1570 ‚Äì Louise Balthazar marries Jean de Bouquetot du Breuil-sur-Touque (1541‚Äì1611) They had a daughter Suzanne de Bouquetot. * 1589 ‚Äì Argentan supported the Catholic \\"Ligue\\", but the bourgeois opened the city gates to King Henry IV of France, a moderate and occasional Protestant. * 1593 - Suzanne married Gabriel de Montgommery II (1565‚Äì1637) in Caen. Montgommery was Lord of Lorges and Courteilles (Eure), and with the wedding he became the Baron of √âcouch√©. Gabriel II, like his more famous father, had been a commander of Huguenot(Protestant) armies operating throughout Normandy. His primary family chateau was at Ducey, near Mont Saint-Michel. A treaty in 1576 forgave Montgommery, and he stopped all military activity before his marriage. * 1638 ‚Äì The second Black Death struck down half the population of Argentan. * 1641 ‚Äì Jaques de Montgommery, son of Gabriel III, inherited Ch√¢teau de la Motte. * 1654 ‚Äì Catherine Cochon, from Ch√¢teau d'Almeneches, and the widow of Nicolas Ango, bought Ch√¢teau de la Motte from Jaques de Montgommery. * 1655 ‚Äì Jean (or Jacques), one of the seven Ango children married Marie Le F√®ver de L√©zeau and bought four partial fiefs in Jou√©-du-Plain.

The chateau was used as country holiday home for Noel's employees, the farm was rented out to a local animal dealer, the buildings were rented to a Paris suburb for a school, and the dependences were leased to a dairy, which became the center for the Resistance in the area. The Chateau was also the distribution center for food and gas coupons both during and after the War, until 1950.

His father, of the same name, was the commander of the Scottish Guard; he accidentally killed King Henry II of France in a jousting tournament. The tragedy occurred during a joust celebrating the Peace of Cateau-Cambr√©sis treaty with the Habsburgs, which ended the Italian War of 1551-1559, and a marriage of the king's daughter. Gabriel de Montgommery I (1530‚Äì1574) killed the King Henry II of France when Montgommery's splintered lance sheared through the King's helmet visor and thrust into his face. The King took 10 days to die, and although Montgommery was pardoned twice from the King's deathbed, he fled the country. The young King's death shook Europe, and made the reputation of the prognosticator Nostradamus, whose recent words seemed to foretell the event. > :CI, Q 35 The young lion shall overcome the older one, :on the field of > combat in single battle. :He shall pierce his eyes in a golden cage, :Two > forces one, then he shall die a cruel death.\\" The top sentence was actually added much later, but the last two lines attracted the popular attention. Montgommery converted to Protestantism in England. Ironically, his job as commander of the Scottish Guard in France was to search out Huguenots (French Protestants), as well as protect the King's life. He returned to France to lead numerous military campaigns in the Wars of Religion for the Protestants. His son, Gabriel de Montgommery II, and eventual owner of Chateau de la Motte, also became a Protestant commander, before and after his father's capture at a siege at Domfront and subsequent beheading. Gabriel de Montgommery I, became a romantic figure linked to a book attributed to Alexander Dumas, The Two Dianas; a French movie; and the Tour Montgommery at Paris‚Äô Conciergerie, where Queen Marie Antoinette was imprisoned before being guillotined. The son, Gabriel II was forgiven in the treaty of 1576, before his marriage to Suzanne de Bouquetot in 1593, daughter of the Baron of √âcouch√©. He thus became the lord of Ch√¢teau de la Motte. The Montgommerys probably did not build at La Motte, but visited the area often, and possibly had a home in √âcouch√©, which still exists. =Nicolas Ango= A year after Nicolas Ango's death (1654) his widow bought Chateau de la Motte and began building the farmhouse. Numerous other properties in Jou√©-du-Plain were also purchased, such as the nearby 16th-century manor Haut Mesnil, in order to fulfill the requirements of the acquiring the title of Marquis. Nicolas couldn‚Äôt attain the title himself, it went to his son, Jean-Baptist after the requisite amount of land was purchased. The title stayed with whoever owned the land afterward. These titles were referred to as Lords of the Robe, as opposed to the old aristocracy, like Montgommery, who were called Lords of the Sword, who often had titles dating back to William the Conqueror. Nicolas Ango was a wealthy bourgeois, and a Counselor to the King. The family had already built the private mansion hotel particulier, across from St. Germain Church in Argentan. Purchase of the title marquisat brought income to the depleted royal treasury of Louis XIV, but Jean-Baptist Ango earned the King's favor by buying and closing the Huguenot temple property in Jou√©-du-Plain. Louis XIV had begun the unpopular process of enforcing the law of making every Christian become a Catholic. Ango's action saved the King an unpleasant job. Jean-Baptist Ango married Marie LeFevre of Lezeau, daughter of Nicolas Le Fevre, advisor to the Parliament of Rouen. On the 18th century Casini map, Marquis de la Motte- Ango was the chateau's title. The Ango source of wealth was unclear; he may have been a lawyer. Many new-rich rose rapidly as merchants, financiers, lawyers, and doctors during the Hundred Years' War and Wars of Religion, because many male aristocrats had died. Louis XIV chose his most trusted servants from among the rising bourgeois and small nobles; two examples were Vauban for fortifications and Colbert for finances. Bourgeois were usually defined as professionals who did not work with their hands. New lords, like the Angos, revived the ideals of country life. Jean-Baptist Ango built what would be the main residence around 1700, and probably the remainder of La Motte's buildings and walls. The son, Ren√©-Phillipe de la Motte-Ango, married Antoinette de Dame Pellev√© Flers. He became the Lord of Ch√¢teau de Flers after the premature deaths of her two uncles; the first uncle from a duel and the second from a horse-fall. The imposing granite Ch√¢teau de Flers is near the town center, and open to the public. Through skillful management, the Fler branch of the family became one of the wealthiest in France. Jean Baptiste Ango IV sold the chateau just before the beginning of the French Revolution. A letter from Voltaire declined the ownership of the chateau in place of payment of a debt of only a 1000 √©cu in 1758. The letter said the lands had been poorly managed and systematically pillaged by the local peasants. French Revolution and the 19th century During the Revolution, like most chateaus, it was probably pillaged but not burned, as portrayed in popular imagination. No useful records survive from the time. Normandy was not strongly partisan during the period. An interim manager sold off stone from the main house to nearby farms. In 1820 the prominent Deschamps family bought the chateau and built the existing home, dated at 1821-22. The barn and the orchard house have similar dates chiseled over the entrances, indicating substantial reconstruction by the family. Andr√© Champrepus, the grandson of the original Deschamps, remembered as poor, portly and single, was the last Marquis. He died at the outbreak of the Second World War. Locals recall visiting the body presented in the chateau's tower, and the nephew paying all the communes taxes that year, a custom among the nobility from the Middle Ages. Second World War Honor√© Jean Noel bought the chateau as a retreat for his employees. He owned a ‚Äò‚Äôcaf√© clos‚Äô‚Äô, or house of prostitution, in Paris. The enterprising Noel with his wife and family live at the chateau, and they rented out the farmland with most of the buildings. Locals recall his bringing his young women there for short breaks \\"to get a tan\\". He provided ponies and carts for the employee to explore the chateau's grounds. He also owned two caf√© clos in Argentan. Locals referred to him as P√®re Noel, and they recall his Proven√ßal accent along with a Mdm. Julos, a loud, tattooed woman that was a permanent member of the family. Emile Buffon, a well liked local man who soon became mayor of Jou√©-du- Plain rented the chateau's farm. Mayors had the delicate jobs of negotiating between German demands and local resentments. This mayor's job made the position more difficult as he worked as an animal dealer. Buffon had to gather the farm animals of local farmers for the German army, as agreed to in the treaty of the French defeat. No farmer wanted to give up his best animals for Nazi diners. * Buffon sublet the farmhouse to a boarding school for Coulombs, Seine-et-Marne, as 20 or so young girls age 8 to 14, attended school. The girls avoided the much-anticipated bombings and ate much better as well. * Farmland was rented to local farmers * Noel leased the two dependences to a dairy to Jacques and Yvonne Bachelier. The couple occupied the winter quarters of the chateau owners, the apartments closest to the chateau home itself. The dairy employees lived above the dairy's stables. * Honor√© Noel with his family and women stayed in the main chateau. He accepted the job of secretary to the mayor, which involved the distribution of coupons for food and fuel. France zonelibre blank The Normans in the countryside ate much better than the city dwellers throughout the War. Forward thinking Parisians made agreements with the farmers for food supplies to be sent on the train weekly. Local people knew things were about to change. Before 1944, Germany stationed most of its troops in towns and cities, and ignored the countryside. The dreaded Gestapo, or Nazi internal police, only came to Normandy in force after January 1944. Until then, most troops stationed in France were older or ill-suited for combat. As the soldiers left, they warned the local French that their replacements would not be like them. Instead, the replacements would be young, intensely indoctrinated in Nazi ideology, and brutally battle hardened by combat on the Russian Front. These were the Waffen SS. In the days leading up to D-Day Europe, air battles in the Norman clouds became more common. The Allies needed experienced pilots. Airmen that survived shooting down made every effort to make contact with R√©sistance forces. With French help, the pilots were to cross France to neutral Spain in order to return to Great Britain to fly and fight again. On April 30, 1944, Charles Moore was flying his P-51 Mustang back from escorting bombers over Germany when four Messerschmitt 109 fighters attacked. He thought he had escaped, but realized he was losing altitude. He leapt from his plunging plane over √âcouch√©. Madame Cavelot, a schoolgirl at the time, remembers seeing his parachute float above the countryside and a truck loading up with German soldiers to bring him in. Two young French boys found him moments before the soldiers did and led him to the Resistance. A P-51 Mustang of the type flown by Moore Moore recalled later that he did not know all the places he hid with the Resistance, but postwar memoires indicated he stayed in Ch√¢teau de la Motte. Others probably did as well, but no records survive saying whom. He recalled being smuggled to a new hideout by Denise Bachelier (sister to dairy owner and Resistant Jacques Bachelier). She returned home to find Germans waiting for her. It was May 21.Charles Moore later recalls his escape on this webpage. Denise Bachelier had entered one of the enduring mysteries and tragedies of Jou√©-du-Plain during World War II, and the subject of a book and two investigations. It was a tragedy for her as well; the Germans sent her and her 18-year-old younger brother to concentration camps, and he died shortly after being freed. =Resistance= Chateau de la Motte was an arms depot for the R√©sistance, but its discovery by the Nazis brought an accusation of collaboration to the mayor of Jou√©-du-Plain. His assassination followed, possibly ordered by his brother. The events took place in and around the Chateau de la Motte. On the day of the mayor's assassination, 16 July, just before dawn, a German Messerschmitt 109 fighter smashed into the large pond at Ch√¢teau de la Motte. The pilot, Haibt Oswald, died immediately. The crash illustrated the desperate situation the occupying army faced. Corporal Oswald was based near Chartres. He died along with two others shot down that day from his outnumbered and out-fueled group. Not only did he die on his first combat mission, but he probably had only four hours of total flying experience. German fuel shortages meant no fuel to practice; it was a costly on-the-job training. In that same dogfight, Canadian Michael O'Kelly was a casualty from Britain's Royal Air Force. He is the only Allied soldier in the graveyard at √âcouch√©. The Allies under General George Patton approached from the south, but the German occupiers continued local oppression, by managing a withdrawal across the Rhine to mount a final defense. After finding the arms depot, the Germans occupied the chateau with soldiers living in the farmhouse and officers in the main house. The Germans installed a bakery on the chateau farm grounds. M. Noel continued distributing rationing coupons for several years after the war, as shortages continued. Noel's son and some of the female employees followed the Allied armies into Germany. The girls' school closed and the schoolmistress left, to rejoin her German boyfriend in Germany. After the Second World War In 1974, Fauvre, a Peugeot engineer bought La Motte along with his wife and their son. In 1986, after Fauvre's death, Rhoisin Beresford, an Irish film director and the former wife of Bruce Beresford bought the chateau from the son. Beresford was a noted director of Driving Miss Daisy and Terms of Endearment. Because of her media links, numerous British notables passed through la Motte, including the heroine in the movie The Messenger: The Story of Joan of Arc starring Milla Jovovich, filmed in nearby S√©es. On December 26, 1999, the chateau suffered major tree damage from the Lothar Storm. The majority of the remaining heritage trees (with the notable exception of the lime trees) from the 18th century Chateau planting were lost. In 2014, the current owner bought La Motte.

According to the Joint-Secretary at Nepal's Ministry of Labor and Transport Management, about 500 Nepalis are estimated to be working in Mauritius.: MYREPUBLICA.com - Mauritius eyes Nepali workers Mauritius began showing interest in employing Nepalese workers in sugarcane farming, sugar industries and tourism (the key sector of the Mauritius economy). Nepal has been sending a nominal number of workers to Mauritius though the Nepalese government formally granted permission to manpower agencies to send workers to the country since 2009. During the fiscal years of 2008 and 2009, the total number of workers flying to Mauritius from Nepal was 24 and they are mainly employed at sugarcane farms, sugar industries and hotels. Labor issues Nepalese workers, along with migrant workers from other countries, claimed that they live in terrible conditions. The workers often live in dormitories provided by their employers that are crowded and decrepit. Also many of them have to take out large loans in order to pay labor agents who connect them with work in Mauritius. However, most workers struggle to make enough to pay back their loans, cover their most basic living expenses and save a small amount of money for their families. In March 2011, a group of Nepalese and Bangladeshi workers went on strike and protested against Santex Ltd, a textile factory in Goodlands where they work, because of the poor living conditions they provided. The expatriates were angry because they have not had water for domestic use for more than three months. And they deplored that the company has been paying them only Rs600 for meal allowance per month.

Although the proceedings themselves were perfunctory, the outcome shaped the Elizabethan religious settlement. Participants The participants were nine leading Catholic churchmen, including five bishops, and nine prominent Protestant reformers of the Church of England. Catholics: *The bishops Ralph Baynes, John White, Thomas Watson, Owen Oglethorpe,http://www.hrionline.ac.uk/johnfoxe/apparatus/person_glossaryO.html Cuthbert Scott;http://www.hrionline.ac.uk/johnfoxe/main/person12_793.html with Alban Langdale, Henry Cole, William Chedsey, and Nicholas Harpsfield.

Edwin Sandys, Edmund Grindal, Robert Horne, John Aylmer, and Edmund Gheast. Accounts From the Protestant side, Cox and Jewel gave official accounts, and John Foxe and Raphael Holinshed published on the conference based on those.Holinshed Project, The peaceable and prosperous regiment of blessed Queene Elisabeth (1587, Volume 6, p. 1182). Other accounts, from Catholics, are by Aloisio Schivenoglia, the Count de Feria, and Nicholas Sanders;G. E. Phillips, The Extinction of the Ancient Hierarchy (1905), p. 80; archive.org. Schivenoglia acted as secretary to Sir Thomas Tresham. Proceedings The conference started on 31 March 1558/9; the disputation began, and was stopped because of disagreement on rules, and was adjourned (as it turned out, permanently), on April 3 (a Monday). The timing coincided with the Easter recess of Parliament. It has been argued that the event was staged to discredit the Catholic position on reform, and Patrick Collinson states that the disputation was manipulated to that end. It took place in Westminster Hall. There were three articles at issue in the disputation (on the liturgical language, church authority over forms of worship, and scriptural warrant for propitiatory masses).Richard Watson Dixon, History of the Church of England: from the abolition of the Roman jurisdiction vol. 5 (1902) pp. 75‚Äì7 note; archive.org. Nicholas Bacon was in the chair, with Nicholas Heath sitting by him.Birt, p. 105. John Feckenham and James Turberville sat with the bishops' side. For the Catholic side, Henry Cole began, defending the use of Latin in the liturgy. Then Robert Horne replied, with a prepared statement. He put the case for English. The disputation then foundered: there was a lack of agreement whether it should be oral or written, and whether Latin or English should be employed. Heath, who had collaborated in Bacon in setting up the disputation, did not intervene to support the Catholic side's view on the pre- agreed conditions. Bacon in the chair was not neutral: he pushed some of the Catholic participants into offensive behaviour. Of the bishops, Watson and White were sent to the Tower of London. Sir Ambrose Cave and Sir Richard Sackville were ordered to search their houses and papers. Six more of the participants were fined by the privy council. Aftermath William Bill preached on the reasons for the imprisonment of the two bishops on 9 April. On the following day a new bill for royal supremacy was moved. The Uniformity Act of 1559 passed successfully through Parliament, but the margin in the House of Lords was a slender three votes. Edward Rishton attributed absences of Catholic bishops and laymen from the Lords to underhand tactics. When in the following year Jewel restated the position of the Church of England after the settlement, and invited refutations, Cole replied to him, starting an extended controversy.

Led by Pete Flannery, who used the stage name Lee Curtis (born 31 October 1939, Norris Green, Liverpool), other group members included Pete Best and Wayne Bickerton. Career Their origins lay in the Detours, a group formed in 1961 by school friends in Liverpool including lead singer Peter Flannery, who adopted a stage name derived from the American singer Curtis Lee. Although they performed regularly in the Liverpool and North Wales areas, Lee Curtis and the Detours split up after a few months. Flannery and his brother and manager Joe, who had previously worked as a singer with the Joe Loss Orchestra, decided to form a new group, to be called Lee Curtis and the All-Stars. In mid 1962 they recruited band members from other local groups. Original members were Frank Bowen (lead guitar), Tony Waddington (rhythm guitar), Wayne Bickerton (bass), and Bernie Rogers (drums). However, when Pete Best was sacked by the Beatles, the Flannery brothers - apparently encouraged by the Beatles' manager Brian Epstein - decided to dispense with Rogers and install Best as the group's drummer. Biography by Bruce Eder, AllMusic They also occasionally performed with singer Beryl Marsden. By the end of 1962, the group were one of the most successful in the area, and placed second in the Mersey Beat annual poll, behind the Beatles but ahead of Gerry and the Pacemakers, the Searchers, and other groups who later became nationally and internationally renowned. Lee Curtis and the All-Stars were signed by Decca Records, and released two singles in early 1963, \\"Little Girl\\" and \\"Let's Stomp\\". However, neither made the charts, and in mid 1963 the rest of the band decided to split from Curtis to form The Original All-Stars. That group later became the Pete Best Four, and several years later Bickerton and Waddington moved on to become the writers and producers behind The Rubettes. Curtis formed a new version of the All-Stars in 1963, with Paul Pilnick (lead guitar), George \\"Porky\\" Peckham (rhythm guitar - in later years a renowned record cutting engineer), Dave \\"Mushy\\" Cooper (bass), and Don Alcyd (drums). The new line-up recorded a single \\"I've Got My Eyes On You\\", contributed two tracks to the Decca album, Live at the Cavern, and played in clubs in Hamburg, but split up soon afterwards. However, Curtis continued to build up his popularity on the club circuit in Germany, and had a year-long residency at the Star-Club. He also recorded regularly in Germany, although the line-up of his backing group, the All-Stars, changed repeatedly. Towards the end of 1967, he was a passenger in a car which crashed while he was on the way to a performance in Germany, and he suffered head injuries. After a few further performances, he decided to leave the music business and returned home to Liverpool. In later years, Lee Curtis worked as a croupier and at the Ford motor works at Halewood, occasionally returning to live performance in Liverpool and Germany. In 2007 he headlined a well attended live music event as Lee Curtis and The Bonds in Cuxhaven, Germany, for the launch of the book We Got Our Kicks in Cux'66 by Jens-Christian Mangels and Ralf Froehlich. He now lives in Hamburg, Germany.

His father was the second son of Sir Anthony Fortescue (third son of Adrian), by Katharine, daughter of Sir Geoffrey Pole. His father resided for many years in London, but in his old age he retired to St. Omer to avoid persecution as a Catholic. George probably received part of his education in the English College of Douay, was in October 1609 admitted as a boarder in the English College at Rome, and was recalled by his parents to Flanders 30 April 1614. He was in London secretary to his cousin Anthony Fortescue, the resident for the Duke of Lorraine at the time of his dismissal by the Houses of Parliament in 1647. He was arrested, and, after an imprisonment of sixteen weeks, was ordered to quit the kingdom with his principal.

Early life Fortescue was the eldest son of Sir John Fortescue, appointed in 1422 Captain of the captured Castle of Meaux, 25 miles NE of Paris. The earliest surviving record of the Fortescue family relates to its 12.c. holding of the manor of Wimpstone in the parish of Modbury, Devon. His younger brother was Sir John Fortescue, Lord Chief Justice of England and Wales. Studies It is probable that he was a student of Lincoln's Inn, and almost certain that he was elected member of parliament for Devon on 11 November 1421. Chief Justice His appointment as Lord Chief Justice of Ireland is dated 25 June 1426, and for a short period his name occurs several times in the Calendar of the Irish Chancery Rolls. From these entries, which contain all that is known of his career, it appears that a salary was assigned to him of forty pounds per annum, which was soon afterwards altered to forty pence per diem, in addition to the custody of certain manors. Fortescue held his appointment only for seventeen months, and was ‚Äòrelieved‚Äô from it by the king's writ on 8 November 1427. Embassy to King Henry VI Almost immediately afterwards he was commissioned by the Parliament of Ireland to accompany Sir James Alleyn on a mission to England, to lay before the king (Henry VI of England) the grievances of his Irish subjects. Again, in 1428, he was sent with Sir Thomas Strange by the lords and commons assembled in Dublin, with the concurrence of Sir John Sutton, the lord-lieutenant, with a number of articles of complaint to be laid again before the king. One of the grievances which he was instructed to represent related to the insults and assaults made upon himself and Sir James Alleyn during their former mission, from which it may be concluded that their first visit to the court had not met with much success. The other griefs for which the parliament prayed redress related to the frequent changes of governors and justices, to the debts left behind them by each successive lord-lieutenant, to the exclusion of Irish law students from the English Inns of Court, and to the treatment of Irishmen travelling in England. There is no further mention of Fortescue in the ‚ÄòPatent Rolls,‚Äô nor is anything known as to his after life, beyond the record of an action brought against him to recover certain lands in Nethercombe, Devonshire. Other appointments He was Sheriff of Devon in 1446 and 1452 and Sheriff of Cornwall in 1447. Marriage and progeny He was twice married, each time to an heiress: *Firstly to Joan Boyun (alias Bozun),Vivian, Lt.Col. J.L., (Ed.)

In 2011 the album was re-recorded and re-issued with the title Skull Orchard Revisted by Langford backed by the Burlington Welsh Male Chorus, based in Toronto.Jon Langford and the Burlington Welsh Male Chorus. Skull Orchard Revisited. Dusted Review.  Background  By the time of its release, The Skull Orchards, initially a songwriting project, had evolved into a full blown band with Langford on guitar and vocals, Chicago guitarist Mark Durante (ex-Revolting Cocks, KMFDM), drummer Steve Goulding (ex-Gang of Four, Graham Parker & the Rumour) and bass player Alan Doughty (ex-Jesus Jones). Among other musicians who took part in recording the album were Mekons' Sally Timms (backing vocals) and Rico Bell (accordion), Drag City Records artist Edith Frost, Bottle Rockets bassist Tom Ray and the Texas Rubies' Jane Baxter Miller. Having lived in America for the previous five years, Skull Orchard saw Langford turning his attention back across the Atlantic to the country he grew up in.

According to NME, Skull Orchard is Langford's \\"irate musings upon his dispirited, neglected homeland; a record which celebrates Welshness against a backdrop of closing mines and factories and grinding poverty\\".

He distinguished himself in several raids against the Byzantine Empire, but his great influence and authority in Syria caused Caliph Harun al-Rashid to imprison him in 803. Released in 809, he was dispatched in 812 by Caliph al-Amin to gather troops against his brother al-Ma'mun in the ongoing civil war between the two brothers, but died of an illness. Biography Abd al- Malik's family were among the most powerful clans during the early Abbasid era. They played an important role in the final overthrow of the Umayyads in Syria, which thereafter became their particular power base. He was the nephew of Abdallah ibn Ali, the first Abbasid governor of Syria, and a son of Salih ibn Ali the first Abbasid governor of Egypt and successor of Abdallah in Syria after the latter staged a failed uprising in 754. Abd al-Malik's elder brothers al-Fadl ibn Salih and Ibrahim ibn Salih also served as governors in Syria and Egypt.. From his father's side, he was a cousin of Caliphs al-Saffah (r. 750‚Äì754) and al-Mansur (r. 754‚Äì775).. His mother was one of the concubines of the last Umayyad Caliph, Marwan II (r. 744‚Äì750). After Marwan's death, she was bought by Salih. Some sources alleged that she was already pregnant at the time, which would mean that Abd al-Malik was a son of Marwan II.. Syria (Bilad al-Sham) and its provinces under the Abbasid Caliphate Under Harun al-Rashid (r. 786‚Äì809), Abd al-Malik held his first major commands: from c. 789 to 793, he was governor of the strategically critical jund Qinnasrin and of the newly created jund of al-'Awasim, which comprised the Caliphate's borderlands with the Byzantine Empire.. From this position, he led expeditions into Byzantine Asia Minor in 790/791 and possibly also in 792/793, when his son Abd ar-Rahman captured the fortress of Thebasa.. In 792, after the death of Ibrahim, Abd al- Malik became the head of his clan, and in 794 he was appointed as governor of the province of Damascus, with his brother Abdallah ibn Salih succeeding him in the border. During the next couple of years, he also served briefly as governor of Medina and Egypt, but he was soon back on the Byzantine frontier: in late 797 he raided into Cappadocia and Galatia as far as Ancyra, where he received an embassy from Empress Irene of Athens (r. 797‚Äì802) which asked for a peace agreement, but was rebuffed. In 798, he led another campaign that reached and plundered the great Byzantine army base and imperial stables at Malagina in Bithynia. He carried off much booty, including the imperial parade horses and baggage-train. On his return, he was attacked by the forces of the themes of Opsikion and Optimatoi, but defeated them. At the same time, his son raided the city of Ephesus.Theophanes the Confessor. Chronicle, AM 6290 and 6291 (); ; . In c. 800, Abd al-Malik was also placed as tutor over Harun's son al-Qasim. His prominence and influence with the army made Harun distrust him and in 803 he was arrested and thrown into prison. The actual reason remains unclear, although most sources agree that his own son, Abd ar-Rahman, informed the Caliph that he was allegedly planning to overthrow him. Abd al-Malik remained imprisoned until Harun's death six years later, when the Caliph al- Amin (r. 809‚Äì813) released him.. Al-Amin's succession was contested by his elder half-brother al-Ma'mun, and there was unrest in Syria. Abd al-Malik still wielded considerable influence over the frontier troops, and therefore he was appointed governor of Syria and Upper Mesopotamia and tasked with securing these regions for al-Amin and raising troops to confront al-Ma'mun. Soon after reaching his seat at Raqqa, however, Abd al-Malik fell ill and died. His grave was demolished a few years later by the victorious al-Ma'mun, allegedly because Abd al-Malik had sworn never to accept al-Ma'mun's rule.

VideoOverIP is similar in many ways to traditional remoting protocols, such as RDP or VNC, but provides a number of additional features which benefit users in Desktop Virtualization or VDI environments. VideoOverIP is currently supported on Microsoft Windows XP, Vista and 7 hosts, with full support for Microsoft Windows Embedded clients and Apple iPad devices, as well as beta support for Linux systems. The protocol has been developed in C++ and incorporates a number of features for efficient transport of remote desktop data across the network. For example, the protocol employs change detection which allows it to isolate changes on screen at the sender, thus reducing the amount of pixel data that has to be transported. Similarly, numerous techniques are employed to automatically sense the type of application running on the sender-side so that the appropriate codecs and compression levels can be employed. VideoOverIP supports two modes of operation which determine how it captures video information from the source: 1\\\\. Mirror Driver Mode Using this methodology, VideoOverIP relies on a mirror driver that is included with the host installer. The mirror driver is used to intercept rendering calls and capture screen changes via an event based model. These changes are then processed by the VideoOverIP change detection, optimization and compression pipelines before being sent to the receiver or client. This technique is typically more efficient in the sense that it utilizes minimum CPU on the host or sender side. 2\\\\. GDI Mode Using this methodology, VideoOverIP uses GDI methods to capture the frame buffer and does not rely on an event based approach to be notified of on-screen changes. This technique has the advantage of capturing the final, processed image from the frame buffer which allows the protocol to support Microsoft Aero or other sophisticated display technologies which require a host-side GPU. The slight drawback with this approach is the increase in host side CPU utilization due to the extra polling employed for source-side video capture.  Connection Broker Support  VideoOverIP does not require a connection broker to operate, but it is fully supported by VDIworks' VDP connection broker and virtual desktop management software.  Major Features  VideoOverIP provides the following major features: * Support for multiple monitors * Support for all major Hypervisors, including VMware ESX and ESXi, Microsoft Hyper-V, Xen and others * Support for physical systems employing no virtualization * Support for Apple iPad devices as clients * Bi- directional audio redirection * USB redirection  References   External links  * VDIworks * VideoOverIP * Original Press Release for VideoOverIP release at PRWeb * Announcement regarding VideoOverIP's optimizations for Microsoft Hyper-V * Fast Remote Desktop VideoOverIP client for iPad Category:Centralized computing Category:Remote desktop Category:Thin clients ","title":"VideoOverIP"},{"id":"32093907","text":"Edward Raymond Cast (1925‚Äì1994) was a British stage, film and television actor.

They were and still are most often worn by dancers at pow wows as regalia. 1822 portrait of Sharitahrish, Pawnee chief The porcupine hair roach is often made of guard hair of the porcupine, the tail hair of the white-tail deer, moose hair, or artificial stiff hair; often, the hair is dyed a bright color, such as red or yellow, which can symbolize a veteran of combat. Some roaches from the southern plains are made with black turkey beards. The term roach also applies to the traditional Mohawk hairstyle worn by some warriors of some southern plains tribes such as the Pawnee and some Algonquian tribes, such as the Mohegan and Lenape. This is where their hair is shorn like a horse‚Äôs mane which was considered stylish in the 19th century. All their hair would be cut, save a strip down the middle of their head. Present day, most roaches have evolved into separate headdresses. They are made from turkey beard hair, porcupine guard hair and deer-tail hair. Depending on where a tribe is from can determine what their headdress will look like. Typically, central and southern plains style their roaches with the front hairs standing straight up with only a gradual outward flare and are usually smaller in size.

Seven homes constructed on the University Park Campus of the University of Nottingham are being designed and constructed to various degrees of innovation and flexibility to allow the testing of different aspects of modern methods of construction including layout and form, cladding materials, roof structures, foundations, glazing materials, thermal performance, building services systems, sustainable/renewable energy technologies, lighting systems, acoustics and water supply. The project aims to stimulate sustainable design ideas and promote new ways of providing affordable, environmentally sustainable housing that are innovative in their design. The homes are fully instrumented and occupied in order to provide comprehensive post occupancy evaluation data.  The David Wilson House  The David Wilson Ecohouse Construction of the CEH project began in 1999 with the David Wilson Ecohouse. This is a 4-bedroom detached property which uses brick and block construction. Its main purpose was to support research into domestic-sized renewable energy systems such as micro-CHP (Combined heat and power), solar thermal, micro-wind, sun pipes, and natural ventilation devices. The house is currently used as office space for University of Nottingham staff and continues to be used as a test bed for University research projects.  The BASF House  The BASF house was the 3rd house to be constructed and was completed in January 2008 taking only 25 weeks to build. The house was designed by Derek Trowell Architects to demonstrate that it is possible to build an affordable low energy house whilst still adherering to the Passivhaus ideology. It meets the level 4 standard of the Code for Sustainable Homes. The house has a compact floor area and relies as much as possible on passive solar design to keep costs down. The north, east and west walls are highly insulated, with the minimum number of openings compatible with acceptable day lighting standards. The southern elevation consists of a fully glazed two-layer adjustable sunspace with glazed screens that can be opened or closed to facilitate heating or cooling. A ground-air heat exchanger, supplied by Rehau, lies to the front of the house and this consists of a network of horizontal pipes buried approximately 2m underground. At this depth the soil temperature only varies between 8-12¬∞C throughout the year. Therefore in winter cold air can be pre-heated before being drawn into the house and in the summer the air can be cooled. A rainwater harvesting system has also been installed, which consists of a 3500 litres tank buried under the car parking space. It collects the run-off water from the roof. This water can be used for washing clothes, watering the garden, flushing the toilet and general cleaning. Water efficiency is also an important factor of the code for sustainable homes and using a rainwater harvesting system drastically reduces the amount of mains water used per person per day. The sun space, at the front of the house captures the solar gain from the sun, heating the air for use in the rest of the house. The south facing elevation is almost 100% glazed and the north facing elevation 30% glazed, providing improved quality of life in the home by maximising the use of natural daylight and reducing the energy required to light the home. On the roof of the house are 3 solar thermal panels used for hot water heating. This is a larger system than is typical for this size of house, which allows storage of hot water for as long as 3 days and helps compensate for extended periods of overcast conditions.  The E.ON 2016 House  The E.ON House is a replica 1930s UK semi-detached house built primarily to research the impact of various retrofitting solutions on the existing housing stock. According to the Code for Sustainable Homes (CfSH) all the new houses built from 2016 are required to meet Level 6 requirements of the CfSH, or be carbon zero. However, it is estimated that by the year 2050, 25 million existing UK homes will still account for between 70 and 90 percent of the housing stock. Around 25% of UK CO2 emissions derive from the domestic housing stock so clearly there is a large opportunity to reduce UK carbon emissions by increasing the efficiency of existing homes. The house is built to 1930s building regulations and the project developers had to receive special planning permission in order to construct the house. It has no roof or wall cavity insulation and uses single glazed windows. Hot water is provided by an outdated, inefficient non- condensing gas boiler and immersion heater. The plan is to bring this 1930s house to a top of the range home meeting Level 6 CfSH. It is hoped that the lessons learnt from this detailed research will help point the way to retrofitting homes to create more sustainable properties. The project consists of three phases: # During the first phase the house was monitored in its original state. There are over 100 sensors positioned around the house monitoring temperature, relative humidity, electricity consumption of individual appliances, gas consumption, water consumption, total electricity consumption and occupancy. # The second phase was carried out from August 2010 to June 2011. The building was upgraded with additional insulation, an improved heating system, double glazing, more efficient lighting and drought proofing. Research was carried out as to the impact of these improvements. # In the third phase, due to begin in late 2011, further improvements will be made incorporating the installation of a conservatory-style extension creating a buffer zone between the property and the outside elements and a sun space to maximise solar gain. Renewable energy technologies, such as Solar panel and solar hot water system will also be installed in order to supply the house with electricity and hot water.  The Tarmac Homes  Tarmac have sponsored the construction of two semi-detached eco-homes called Tarmac House. These are designed by ZEDfactory, the company responsible for the BEDZED project in south London. One home is built to Level 4 CfSH and the other to Level 6 CfSH. These houses demonstrate that it is possible to build a sustainable home using currently available materials and traditional methods of construction. Sustainability features of the properties include: * Extremely well insulated walls with 250 mm of cavity wall insulation. * A Biomass heating system situated in front of the houses. * A Solar water heating system with roof- mounted solar panels. * Solar century sun slates on the level 6 house helping to meet electricity demands.  The Nottingham H.O.U.S.E (Home Optimising the Use of Solar Energy)  Nottingham H.O.U.S.E is a small family \\"starter\\" home, which was built as a part of a Solar Decathlon Europe 2010 event by the students of the Department of Architecture and Built Environment. The house delivers a zero carbon sustainable design solution that is compliant with level 6 of UK's Code for Sustainable Homes. It is a prefabricated two storey house with a courtyard garden that can be used in terrace or semi-detached form. The House was presented at the Ecobuild 2010 event and awarded with the prize for the best use of timber. The models of the house were also presented at the Shanghai Expo 2010. The prefabricated house is due to be moved on to the University Park campus of the University of Nottingham in the near future.  The Mark Group House  The Mark Group house is currently under construction. It is a 4-bedroom property constructed using a steel framing system with insulation cladding. Construction of the basement uses an Insulating Concrete Form (ICF) which incorporates Ground Granulated Blast Furnace Slag (GGBS) into the Portland cement. Manufacturing Portland cement produces around 1 tonne of CO2 per tonne of concrete whereas GGBS, as a by- product of the iron industry, produces only 0.1 tonnes of CO2 per tonne. GGBS can be mixed with Portland cement 70%-30% to decrease its carbon footprint by around 40%.

This review has been performed while taking into consideration the needs that are specific to Qatar‚Äôs local environment, culture, and policies. This has led to adaptations and additions to sustainability criteria. Measurements for the rating system are designed to be performance-based and quantifiable. The result is a performance-based sustainable building rating system customized to the unique conditions and requirements of the State of Qatar.Gulf Organisation for Research and Development and Qatar Olympic Committee Ink MOU  Emirates Week Rating System QSAS consists of a series of sustainable categories and criteria, each with a direct impact on environmental stress mitigation. Each category measures a different aspect of the project‚Äôs environmental impact. The categories define these broad impacts and address ways in which a project can mitigate the negative environmental effects. These categories are then broken down into specific criteria that measure and define individual issues. These issues range from a thorough review of water consumption to an assessment of light quality. Each criterion specifies a process for measuring individual aspects of environmental impact and for documenting the degree to which the requirements have been met. A score is then awarded to each criterion based on the degree of compliance.Privacy Policy  Green Building Solutions Doha The eight categories of QSAS are the following: Urban Connectivity [UC] The Urban Connectivity category consists of factors associated with the urban environment such as zoning, transportation networks and loadings. Loadings on the urban environment include traffic congestion and pollution. Site [S] The Site category consists of factors associated with land use such as land conservation or remediation and site selection, planning and development. Energy [E] The Energy category consists of factors associated with energy demand of buildings, the efficiency of energy delivery, and the use of fossil energy sources that result in harmful emissions. Water [W] The Water category consists of factors associated with water consumption and its associated burden on municipal supply and treatment systems. Materials [M] The Materials category consists of factors associated with material extraction, processing, manufacturing, distribution, use/re-use, and disposal. Indoor Environment [IE] The Indoor Environment category consists of factors associated with indoor environmental quality such as thermal comfort, air quality, acoustic quality, and light quality. Cultural & Economic Value [CE] The Cultural and Economic Value category consists of factors associated with cultural conservation and support of the national economy. Management & Operations [MO] The Management and Operations category consists of factors associated with building design management and operations. Rating System Resources QSAS consists of several resources used to facilitate the assessment of sustainability performance for buildings in Qatar. Target users for the resources are building planners, developers, owners, designers, engineers and environmentalists. The major resources available to QSAS members include the following: * RFP Preparation: A guide to facilitate the preparation of an RFP and Project Brief in the pre-design stages of development * Assessment Manuals: Outline the specific measurements, submittals, and scores for each criterion that is assessed for each building type. * Design Guidelines: Consist of recommendations to be used as guidance for realizing sustainable buildings in Qatar. * Training Manual: Covers the detailed instructions and examples for completing each criterion. * Energy Manuals: Documents the application and implementation of the CEN/ISO energy performance standard and all its related standards to all buildings in Qatar. * Toolkits: Computational systems provided to facilitate the evaluation of a project's performance under the assessment system. The toolkits compute the final project score and certification level for the project using each criterion score entered by the user. * Calculators: Normative measures provided for many criteria to evaluate the project's performance and compute a final criterion score. * Project Management System (PMS): Online tool used by project teams to document, upload, and certify their projects in the assessment system. QSAS Schemes QSAS has been developed to rate different building types as well as projects on the Neighborhood scale for each phase of a building‚Äôs lifespan. The building schemes that can be rated with QSAS include: * Commercial * Core & Shell * Schools * Residential * Mosques * Hotels * Light Industry * Sports * Neighborhoods Phases that can be rated using QSAS include: * Design * Construction *Operations: New/Existing Buildings The various schemes use similar categories and criteria across each system to facilitate use. The measurements, calculations, simulations, scoring ranges, and weights change accordingly for each building type and project phase. QSAS Certification The aim for all QSAS criteria and their associated measurements is to be performance-based and quantifiable on the scoring scale of -1 to 3 (-1, 0, 1, 2, 3) or 0 to 3, depending on the criterion‚Äôs level of impact. Each category and criterion has an associated weight based on its relative environmental, social, and economic impact. Once a score is assigned to each criterion in the assessment system, the values are multiplied by the weight and a cumulative final score is determined. QSAS consists of six certification levels to measure the project‚Äôs impact. A building that obtains a cumulative final score below 0 does not meet the baseline and will be denied certification. Certification can only be achieved when the final score is greater than or equal to 0, earning a rating of 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, or 6 stars. The highest score a building can achieve is 3.0 and the highest certification level is 6 stars.Sustainability Award  Green Building Solutions Doha Professional Accreditation Professional Accreditation is granted to those qualified individuals who demonstrate in‚Äêdepth knowledge of the Qatar Sustainability Assessment System (QSAS) and sustainable building practices.

Early life  Some of the engineering talent of Sky Kleinhans was inherited. He was born in Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania, the son of a designer of large rolling mill machinery for steel mills. One day when Sky was about 3¬Ω years old he was traveling with his father (Frank Brasil Kleinhans) when their buggy was sandwiched between two streetcars his father was killed and young Sky was ejected from the accident. Sky started at the Pittsburgh Academy in the fifth grade, then in 1916 his family moved to California, where he graduated from Hollywood High in 1922. Then he continued his education at the University of Southern California Branch (now UCLA) then transferred to UC Berkeley where he majored in chemistry. He joined the Alpha Kappa Lambda fraternity there. In 1924 he attended Massachusetts Institute of Technology, switching to math, physics and anything to do with aircraft or boats, where he earned a BS in mathematics in 1927.  Aviation career  After graduation in the summer 1927, he started work at Keystone Aircraft in Bristol Pennsylvania to develop Felixstowe F5L flying boats, an aircraft designed by John Cyril Porte at the Seaplane Experimental Station in England. Then there was a series of aircraft design jobs with fledgling airplane firms including Metal Aircraft Corporation Flamingo of Cincinnati Ohio, where Sky was assistant chief engineer during the summer 1929 ‚Äì December 1929. He worked on the Flamingo made famous as the airplane that flew Jimmie Angel to discover with worlds highest waterfall Angel Falls. Sometimes in those early years an aircraft can be designed, built and test flown in four to five months. At Sikorsky Aviation Corporation, Stratford Connecticut, Sky was in charge of the XP3S1 aircraft development, the Sikorsky S-38 and the Navy's XSS-1 and XSS-2, an experimental scout- observation flying-boats. Often he helped with the design of the Sikorsky S-40, Sikorsky S-41 and Sikorsky S-42. Sky started work in the summer of 1933 at the Douglas Aircraft Company hired by James H. Kindelberger (Dutch) and he was put in charge of all flying boats as a project engineer. In 1935 he was appointed assistant chief designer for all of Douglas Aircraft, including the B-19 and DC-4. From 1937 to 1940 he was promoted to chief designer, and when World War II started in 1941 he became assistant chief engineer, Edward F. Burton (designer of the Douglas DC-3) was now chief engineer, but by 1960 Sky became chief engineer then director of research and engineering. His last position was chairman of the scientific advisory board in until his retirement in 1967.  Aircraft designs  After his seaplane and flying boat work at Douglas he became very involved in transport aircraft the entire DC-3 through DC-9 series. His airplane design philosophy was driven by a combination of function and airline requirements embodied in five key points.Flight Global, January 1957 pages 80-82 *First‚ÄîCapacity up by 50% *Second‚ÄîOperating cost reduced by 20%, this improves airline revenue *Third‚ÄîPerformance 20% improvement in speed and range *Fourth‚ÄîComfort, interiors had to look and feel different *Safety‚ÄîBad-weather aids, autopilots, reverse thrusters, brakes During Douglas's long transport history they had not marketing a new aeroplane that was not an improvement in the type of aircraft it was replacing in each of these five cardinal points.

Life  Eugene was the younger son of the Duke Ernest Frederick II of Saxe-Hildburghausen and his wife Countess Caroline of Erbach- F√ºrstenau (1700‚Äì1758). His godfather was, in addition to other princes, Prince Eugene of Savoy. At the wedding of his brother Ernest Frederick III Charles with the only daughter of the Danish royal couple, Eugene was awarded the Ordre de l'Union Parfaite. In Danish royal service he attained the rank of lieutenant-general of the infantry and in Hildburghausen, he was commander of the Artillery Corps. In 1765, Prince Eugene founded the porcelain factory at Kloster Veilsdorf. Eugene's brother, the Duke, gave the factory many privileges. Economic success, however, remained low. He was the owner of the manor Weitersroda where he founded a new parish and built a new church and a royal villa. In Hildburghausen, he was the tenant of the mint and builder of the so-called , one of the most beautiful buildings in the city. Eugene was a skilled mechanic and gunner. In 1769 he and his great-uncle Joseph and Duchess Charlotte Amalie of Saxe-Meiningen were appointed Commissioner for the completely indebted Principality of Saxe-Hildburghausen by Emperor Joseph II. He misappropriated assets, leading to the dispute with Prince Joseph.Sch√∂ppl: The Dukes of Saxe-Altenburg, Bolzano, 1917, reprint Altenburg, 1992, p. 89 Following his disgrace for misappropriation of money, Eugene needed a place to stay.

He accepted their offer and moved in 1770 to √ñhringen. A few years later, on 13 March 1778, Eugene married his niece, the Princess Caroline (1761‚Äì1790), daughter of his brother Ernest Frederick III, Duke of Saxe- Hildburghausen. They had no children. Eugene and his wife resided at √ñhringen, in the principality ruled by his brother-in-law Louis, and on a modest property belonging to him, until their respective deaths.

Description and anatomy The blacktail shiner is a somewhat slender minnow with 8-9 rays on the anal fin, and a prominent black spot at the base of the caudal fin (tail fin). The back is usually yellowish-olive, and the sides are silvery with hints of blue. Adults usually reach in length. The blacktail shiner has a large, black caudal spot which distinguishes it from most other minnows. The caudal spot of the blacktail shiner may be faint, especially in populations inhabiting turbid waters, and they could likely be confused with the red shiner (C. lutrensis); however, the red shiner has 9 anal rays (versus 8) and usually 35 or fewer lateral scales (versus 36 or more). Geographic distribution The blacktail shiner occurs in Gulf of Mexico drainages from Suwannee River, Georgia and Florida, to Rio Grande, Texas; Mississippi River basin (mostly on Former Mississippi Embayment) from southern Illinois to Louisiana and west in Red River drainage to western Oklahoma. Blacktail shiners are found in the southern United States west of the Appalachian Mountains. The species ranges east and west from north central Florida to West Texas, and north to southern Illinois. In Texas, blacktail shiners are unknown in the Panhandle, being found primarily from the Edwards Plateau eastward. The blacktail shiner has also been found from the Rio Grande basin in Texas, east to the Suwannee River, and north through the Mississippi River basin to the confluence of the Ohio River. Two of the three recognized subspecies occur in Alabama.Gibbs, R.H., Jr. 1957. Cyprinid fishes of the subgenus Cyprinella of Notropis III variation and subspecies of Notropis venusta (Girard). Tulane Stud. Zool. 5:175-203. The slender blacktail shiner, C. v. stigmaturus, is found in the upper Mobile River basin (most frequently above the Fall Line), while the eastern blacktail shiner, C. v. cercositgma, occurs in the lower Mobile River basin and coastal rivers draining the state. Intergradations between these subspecies have been recognized in the Alabama, Cahaba, and Tallapoosa river systems. Ecology and habitat The blacktail shiner feeds primarily on invertebrates. Its diet includes algae, seeds, and aquatic and terrestrial insects. Aquatic insects and algae were the most common food items of blacktail shiners in the Blanco River, Texas; sediment and detritus were found in 21% of the 36 guts examined. Blacktail shiners feed primarily during the day. Blacktail shiners may serve as major food resource for piscivorous spotted bass (Micropterus punctulatus) during the summer in Village Creek (Neches River), Texas. The blacktail shiner is most common in pools and runs of clear, sandy-bottomed, small to medium rivers, typically in areas with sparse vegetation and strong current, but upland populations occur in creeks over substrates with more gravel and rubble.Lee, D.S., Gilbert, C.R., Hocutt, C.H., Jenkins, R.E., McAllister, D.E. and Stauffer, J.R. Jr. 1980. Atlas of North American freshwater fishes. North Carolina State Museum of Natural History, Raleigh, North Carolina.Page, L.M. and Burr, B.M. 2011. Peterson field guide to freshwater fishes of North America north of Mexico. Houghton Mifflin Harcourt, Boston, Massachusetts. Populations in the western part of the species' range are often found in turbid water. Blacktail shiner mesohabitat is ubiquitously distributed among pools, runs, and riffles with silt, gravel, and bedrock substrates. In the Blanco River, Texas, blacktail shiners were most abundant in swift runs in the spring and summer. The species occurred throughout the year in riffle and sandbank habitats in Village Creek (Neches River), Texas. During summer, most individuals were collected from sandbank habitats; they were also found in deep channel and riffle habitats, though no blacktail shiners longer than occurred in riffles. Individuals smaller than were found predominately in riffle habitats during fall and winter. Juveniles occurred almost exclusively in sandbank mesohabitat during spring. Blacktail shiners are commonly found in sandy or rocky areas of Lake Texoma (Oklahoma/Texas), generally in clearer water of the downstream area; they are occasionally abundant in the tailwaters, and rarely found in the headwaters.

Master of Science Thesis, Texas State University-San Marcos.61 pp. In Texas, the blacktail shiner spawning season is April through September. In Mississippi, it is late March through early October, with most females reproductive from April to early September.Heins, D.C. 1990. Mating behaviors of the blacktail shiner, Cyprinella venusta, from southeastern Mississippi. Proc. S.E. Fishes Council 21:5-7. In Village Creek, Texas, blacktail shiners revealed size distribution patterns consistent with a protracted spawning season.Moriarty, L.J., and K.O. Winemiller. 1997. Spatial and temporal variation in fish assemblage structure in Village Creek, Hardin County, Texas. Texas Journal of Science 49(3):85-110. Prime spawning habitat for the blacktail shiner is in fractional crevices; generally located in flowing water, preferring crevices in current velocities of . Populations in reservoirs chose crevice sites in locations of much lower current speeds. In the Blanco River, Texas, blacktail shiners were observed depositing eggs underneath small boulders and large cobble in a bedrock riffle in the swiftest current velocities available. Males respond to sounds produced by spawning females and are able to distinguish these sounds from those produced by related female red shiners. Males are territorial, defending a crevice from other males. Breeding pair swims along the crevice, the female deposits eggs; usually the sperm has already been released into the crevice, so the eggs are deposited into a crevice with viable sperm. Immediately after spawning, the male doubles back and eats any eggs that failed to make it into the crevice. Small males (sneakers) try to fertilize eggs by darting between the dominant male and spawning female. Both large and small males will enter another male's territory and deposit sperm in a crevice before the male courts a female to lay eggs in the crevice.Heins, D.C. and Dorsett, D.R. 1986. Reproductive traits of the blacktail shiner, NOTROPIS VENUSTUS (Girard) in southern Mississippi. Southwest Naturalist 31: 185-189. One study in the Blanco River, Texas found that female blacktail shiners had up to 340 ova. Another study in southwestern Mississippi found that clutch sizes ranged between 139 and 459 ova in females ; average mature ovum diameter was ; ovaries in mature females constituted 5.8-19.1% of the somatic body weight. Females from the Pearl River, Mississippi, spawned 20-46 clutches during the reproductive season. The size of sexual maturation is between and . In the Leaf River system, Mississippi, average length was for age 1, for age 2, and for age 3; populations consisted mainly of age classes 0 and IBaker, J.A., K.J. Kilgore, and S.A. Foster. 1994.

In the first year, blacktail shiners reach about . Average length was for age 0, for age 1, for age 3 and older in the Blanco River, Texas. Management The blacktail shiner is of relatively low conservation concern. Their populations are stable, but some issues of concern include habitat changes associated with flood control projects, siltation from development sites, deterioration of water quality, and recent water drawdown for mining and irrigation.Walser, C.A. and H.L. BART. 1999. Influence of agriculture on in-stream habitat and fish community structure in Piedmont watersheds of the Chattahoochee River system. Ecol. Fresh. Fish 8:237-246.Johnston, C.E. and T.M. Farmer. 2004. Status of fish species of high conservation concern in the Uchee Creek system (Chattahoochee River 39 drainage), Alabama. Alabama Department of Conservation and Natural Resources Report. Activities such as construction and operation of hydroelectric facilities, flood control, additional irrigation diversions, bank stabilization, oil and gas drilling, mining, grazing, stocking or introduction of nonnative fishes may jeopardize the continued existence of the blacktail shiner. Another potential impact on the population could be hybridization.

Military service Appointed a Lieutenant in the Royal Navarre Cavalry, he was seconded to the Garde du Corps in the rank of Captain, before being promoted Mestre de camp en second (Major) in the Dauphin's Regiment of Dragoons. Diplomatic career  He was French Minister to United States from 1787 to 1789, and Ambassador Extraordinary to London in 1793. In 1769, he was posted to Lisbon with his brother, Marquis de Clermont d'Amboise as Attach√©. In 1772, King Louis XV appointed him Minister-Counsellor to London. In 1776, he was appointed Secretary in the French Embassy at Naples, where his brother, Gaspard (marquis de Clermont d'Amboise), was also serving. In 1778, he was appointed Minister Plenipotentiary to the Elector of Trier until 1783, when he was posted as a Special Envoy to London following the peace treaty signed between Britain and France.www.history.state.gov In 1787 he was appointed Minister Plenipotentiary to the United States. As minister he authored reports analyzing the U.S. Constitution and the prospects for its ratification. In 1790, he was recalled to a diplomatic post in Berlin and in September 1791, King Louis XVI offered him the post of Foreign Minister, which he declined. Although denying accusations of organizing a coalition of counter-revolutionaries in Prussia, it later emerged that the Count had been the instigator of this anti-Republican coalition. The King of France, then appointed him as French Ambassador to Constantinople. The Revolutionary forces upon seizing power, called for the Comte (as he was then styled by courtesy) to be guillotined. However, the King's brother, the future Louis XVIII, gave de Moustier full authority to represent the interests of the French monarchy, and in 1792, he was granted the dignity of Regent, whilst the King remained in captivity. In 1793, he returned to England, where he conducted negotiations between British military commanders and √âmigr√© troops. In 1795, he coordinated the landing of Royalists at Quiberon Bay. After the failure of the invasion, he fled to Prussia, then England before returning to France in 1814 upon the Bourbon Restoration, but was exiled again in 1815. =Washington correspondence= *Letter to the Count de Moustier, August 17, 1788 *Letter to Comte de Moustier, May 25, 1789 *Letter to Comte de Moustier, November 1, 1790 Grand-croix de Saint-Louis Honours In 1784, he received the Grand Cross of Saint-Louis and, in 1789, he was appointed Knight of Saint George (Burgundy).www.memodoc.com De Moustier was also a Knight of Malta and Officier of the L√©gion d'honneur. Family He was the third son of Philippe-Xavier, marquis de Moustier (died 1776) by his wife Louise de Bournel (died 1793), daughter of Jean-Charles, marquis de Namps. He married Antoinette-Louise Millet, who died in 1783; on 2 January 1779, in Koblenz, they had a son, Edward-Clement (later 4th Marquis), who also went on to become a senior French diplomat. After the death of the marquise, √âlie de Moustier became closely associated with her married sister, Anne-Flore Millet (marquise de Br√©han).www.britishmuseum.org His appointment as French Ambassador to the United States by Louis XVI caused further uproar in France, leading to his recall in October 1789. It became apparent that he had used his time visiting President Washington at Mount Vernon to paint portraits of George Washington and Eleanor Parke Custis.www.yale.edu In 1801, he succeeded his elder brother Charles de Moustier in the marquessate.

The township was merged in 1964 into Mead Township.  History  Warren County was formed on March 12, 1800 out of Allegheny County, with the original township of Brokenstraw being formed in that October from everything in the county west of the Allegheny River and Conewango Creek; Conewango Township was formed in March 1808 and consisted of the unincorporated eastern half of Warren County.Schenck, p. 259. On March 26, 1846, a portion of Corydon Township in McKean County was set off for Warren County.Hottenstein, p. 127.Schenck, p. 266. Philip Tome, a native of Dauphin County, was the first settler in Corydon in 1827 and for many years was interpreter for Seneca chiefs Cornplanter and Governor Blacksnake. The Buffalo, New York, and Philadelphia Railroad opened in 1882 and brought growth to the community, bringing in stores, a hotel, a stave-mill, a pulp company, a spoke factory, a handle factory, a saw mill, a shingle mill, and various other industries.Warren County Historical Society History of Warren County Pennsylvania Schenck 1887 Population of (West) Corydon peaked in 1900; while it received a modest boost in population in the 1890s, it did not experience the massive boom and bust that its neighboring townships along the Allegheny did. It was in a state of persistent decline through the first half of the 20th century and had already shrunk to less than a third of its peak by 1960. Construction of the Kinzua Dam caused the resulting Allegheny Reservoir to submerge the remaining communities in Corydon Township. The township was merged into Mead Township in 1964.  Geography  Corydon Township was located on a strip of land in the extreme northeastern corner of Warren County, and was bounded by South Valley Township, New York on the north; (East) Corydon in McKean County on the east, Kinzua Township to the south; and the Allegheny River on the west.Schenck, p. 559.

Early life and education Melanie Lyn Slate grew up in Ridgewood, New Jersey and Middletown Township, New Jersey, attending Middletown High School South.Malwitz, Rick. \\"Author to sign copies of Melanie McGuire book\\", Courier News, November 26, 2008. Accessed November 24, 2014. \\"For example, according to Melanie's brother, when his sister, the former Melanie Slate, was attending Middletown South High School, she boasted about affairs with two married teachers.\\" She enrolled at Rutgers University with a double major in math and psychology and graduated in 1994. She graduated, second in her class, from the Charles E. Gregory School of Nursing (now Raritan Bay Medical Center) in 1997 with a nursing diploma. She married US Navy veteran William T. ‚ÄúBill‚Äù McGuire (born September 21, 1964) in 1999. Murder By April 2004, the McGuires had been married for five years. She was a nurse at a fertility clinic and he was a computer programmer. The couple had two sons and lived in a Woodbridge Township, New Jersey apartment, but planned to move that month to a larger home in Warren County. They closed the documents on their new house on April 28 but never moved in. That night, according to the prosecution, McGuire drugged her husband, shot him to death, and subsequently dismembered his body. She put his remains into a 3-piece suitcase set, and those three pieces were later found dumped in Chesapeake Bay.  Investigation  On May 5, the first suitcase containing legs was found washed up in Virginia Beach, Virginia, and a murder investigation was launched. On May 11, a second larger suitcase was found floating in the bay, containing a head and torso with two bullet wounds. The third and smallest suitcase, containing the arms, was recovered on a beach on May 16. Police released a composite sketch of the victim which an acquaintance of Bill McGuire's recognized. McGuire then became the prime suspect in the investigation. Because the murder did not occur in Virginia, however, authorities turned over their investigation to the New Jersey State Police. During the investigation, incriminating evidence was uncovered against McGuire. On April 30, 2004, for example, his 2002 Nissan Maxima was found outside the Flamingo Motel in Atlantic City, New Jersey, and the police discovered a security video of the car being moved. Melanie later claimed she had moved the car as a \\"prank\\" even though she had applied for a protection from abuse order days earlier based on an alleged slapping incident. On April 26, 2004, McGuire purchased a .38 caliber handgun with unusual wadcutter bullets from a store in Easton, Pennsylvania. Bill McGuire was killed with a .38 caliber handgun with wadcutter bullets. In addition, police learned that Melanie McGuire had been having a long-term affair with a co-worker at the fertility clinic named Bradley Miller. Her E-ZPass tag was recorded at a toll in Delaware two days after the murder. She claimed that this was the result of her going furniture shopping in Delaware since it has no sales tax. Before she was charged with murder, McGuire called E-ZPass and attempted to have the $0.85 charge removed from her account history. Days later, an unidentified man, believed by many to be McGuire's step-father, also called and attempted to have the charge removed. The plastic bags that contained the body were demonstrated by forensics to be from the same roll of bags that McGuire had in her home. The luggage that the body was found in matched a set that she had in her basement, which was missing the same size bags as those the body was found in. Further, fibers found in the body matched those from the type of sofa (now missing) that the couple had owned (indicating that a cushion had probably been used as a makeshift silencer). Similarly, a medical grade towel found with the body matched those in the house and others stocked at the clinic she worked in. Police believed that McGuire used a syringe and prescription from her work to obtain the drug used as means to incapacitate her husband. Trial On June 2, 2005, more than a year after the murder, McGuire was arrested at her new home in Brick Township, New Jersey and was charged with first-degree murder. She was immediately booked into the Middlesex County Adult Correctional Center, but made her $750,000 bail ($ million today). Through her attorneys, Joe Tacopina, Steve Turano, and Marc Ward, she pleaded not guilty to the charges. After being released on bail, McGuire faced additional charges on October 11, 2005. A four-count indictment came down from a state grand jury. Her bail was raised to $2.1 million ($ million today), but she was again released. More than a year later, on October 26, 2006, McGuire was charged with two counts of hindering apprehension for allegedly writing letters to police aimed at getting them off her trail. She again pleaded not guilty and was released after posting $10,000 bail. Almost three years after the crime, McGuire's murder trial commenced at the Middlesex County Courthouse in New Brunswick on March 5, 2007. Prosecutors contended her motive for murder was to take up a new life with her lover. McGuire persisted in claiming she was innocent, and claimed her husband had become increasingly moody and unpredictable and was a compulsive gambler. On April 23, 2007, McGuire's murder trial jury found her guilty of first-degree murder, finding that the evidence established her culpability for the murder beyond a reasonable doubt. She was also convicted of the lesser charges of perjury, desecration of human remains, and possession of a weapon for an unlawful purpose. However, McGuire was acquitted of the two counts of hindering apprehension, as well as tampering with evidence and possession of Xanax without prescription. Shortly after her conviction, but before sentencing, McGuire appealed for a new trial on the basis of the story of a jailhouse informant (Christopher Thieme) that her husband was deeply in debt and may have been killed by Atlantic City mobsters. However, prosecutors established that the informant was \\"entirely incredible and routinely and habitually fabricates stories\\", according to a New Jersey State Police investigation, before recanting and accusing McGuire's attorney of suborning perjury. With the story debunked, the request for a new trial was withdrawn.O'Neill, Jim. \\"McGuire's mystery witness is a fraud\\" Newark Star-Ledger (July 18, 2007) https://www.state.nj.us/grc/decisions/pdf/2014-275.pdf On July 19, 2007, at the age of 34, McGuire was sentenced to life in prison. Aftermath During her arraignment on murder charges, McGuire's case was dubbed the \\"Suitcase Murder\\" by various media outlets. Author John Glatt wrote a book about the case, entitled \\"To Have and To Kill\\". The case has been profiled on television outlets: Snapped Oxygen Network; Dateline NBC; 48 Hours Mystery CBS; and The Investigators TruTV; Deadly Affairs Investigation Discovery, and Forensic Files II, among other true crime television shows. McGuire's conviction was affirmed by an appeals court on March 16, 2011. She must serve more than 63 years before she is eligible for parole. On September 20, 2011, the New Jersey Supreme Court declined to hear her further appeal. On April 29, 2014, McGuire filed a motion for post-conviction relief, alleging ineffective assistance of counsel and newly discovered evidence. On September 25, 2014, McGuire appeared in court with her new attorney Lois DeJulio, a public defender, to try to get a hearing that could overturn her 2007 murder conviction, on the grounds that her previous legal representation (by Joe Tacopina) was inadequate or ineffective. The request was subsequently denied.

Career and Research Hurst was a Royal Society University Research Fellow at the University of Cambridge from 1993 to 1996 and has been a Professor at the University of Bath since 1997. His research interests include evolution, genetics and genomics using computational and mathematical techniques to understand the way genes and genomes evolve. This has resulted in work on housekeeping genes, gene orders, and the evolution of drug resistance in Staphylococcus aureus, Saccharomyces cerevisiae and the evolution of sexual reproduction / sexual dimorphism. Hurst works on fundamental problems in the evolution of genetic systems, such as understanding why some sorts of mutations are less damaging than predicted whilst others are more damaging. Mutations that change proteins are, surprisingly, often not especially deleterious. Hurst showed that this was because the genetic code is structured in a way that renders it highly error-proof. Similarly, in applying network representations of gene interactions, he revealed why many deletions of genes have little effect and which deletions tend not to be recessive. One or more of the preceding sentences incorporates text from the royalsociety.org website where: By contrast, Hurst revealed that genomic changes often considered to be relatively harmless ‚Äì such as gene order changes and mutations at 'silent' sites ‚Äì are under selection for unanticipated reasons. He also showed how synonymous mutations can disrupt the way gene transcripts are processed. Similarly, in showing that genomes are arranged into gene expression domains, Hurst revealed that genes can affect the expression of other genes in their vicinity. translation of this fundamental work to medicine is a focus of his research. =Awards and honours= Hurst was elected a Fellow of the Academy of Medical Sciences (FMedSci) and a Fellow of the Royal Society (FRS) in 2015.

The name of the resort is from the Semiahmoo indigenous people in whose Salish language it is the word for \\"half moon\\" and describes the crescent shaped land the resort was built. Semiahmoo Resort opened in 1987 and is home to the Semiahmoo Golf and Country Club, set further south of the sandy spit along the coast. The Semiahmoo golf course was designed by Arnold Palmer and was voted the 6th best golf course in Washington state by Golfweek in 2011. The resort hosts the Jeff Coston Academy, a notable golf academy. The AAA four diamond hotel, located at Semiahmoo Point, has 198 deluxe guest rooms including 28 suites. The resort has become a popular residence for Americans who work for Vancouver area companies who are willing to commute across an international border due to the extreme housing costs in Vancouver. The hotel, restaurants and spa closed effective December 1, 2012. In June 2013, The Resort Semiahmoo LLC, a part of the Wright Hotels group of Seattle, Washington purchased the hotel for $19.5 Million. With $6 Million of planned renovations in place, the resort officially re-opened for limited operations on August 15, 2013. Location In January, 2014, the Pacific Northwest Resort began a $9 million renovation project. In the summer of 2016 the resort opened a beach activities center located in one of the existing cannery buildings. Operations are during summer months with hours from 11 am to 2pm Monday through Thursday and from 10 am to 5 pm Friday to Sunday. For years, the resort owned the Loomis Trail Golf Course, located approximately 4 miles east of the Semiahmoo Golf & Country Club. The Lummi Indian Business Council announced it had purchased the Loomis Trail Golf Course in October, 2018.

He appeared in 11 Major League games as a relief pitcher for the Baltimore Orioles in . A switch hitter who threw left-handed, Schneider stood tall and weighed . He is perhaps best remembered for appearing on Cal Ripken, Jr.'s 1982 Topps rookie card. Born in Washington, Schneider attended high school in Illinois before attending Iowa State University. Drafted twice, he signed with neither team, opting to sign with the Philadelphia Phillies as a free agent in 1974. He played five years in their organization, leading the Carolina League in wins and saves in 1977 without making a single start. After the 1978 season, he was selected by the Baltimore Orioles in the Rule 5 draft; he reached the major leagues in 1981 when the Orioles sought to reinforce their roster for the second half of the season. Used exclusively in relief, Schneider appeared in 11 games, recording a save. After the season, he was a minor part of a trade to the California Angels. He split 1982 between their system and the Toronto Blue Jays' organization and finished his career in 1983 in the minors for the Blue Jays. Early life Schneider was born in Bremerton, Washington but attended Alleman Catholic High School in Rock Island, Illinois.

It was formerly known as Our Lady of Grace Academy (OLGA) and was renamed to SMACC on December 8, 2000 as the school marked its Golden Jubilee to unify the RVM system schools. SMACC is located at Madre Ignacia Avenue (12th Ave.), Grace Park, Caloocan City. History In 1969, the High School Department transferred to 12th Avenue while the Grade School and Pre- Elementary Departments followed in 1981, leaving the original school building to the priests of the Missionary Oblates of Mary Immaculate (OMI). In response to the challenge to offer quality education, the school decided to pursue PAASCU accreditation. The preliminary visit was conducted in 1983 and its formal visit was in 1985. In 1988, the school was granted five-year accreditation which was followed by two more revisits, in 1994 and in 1999. Established as an all-girls school, the then Our Lady of Grace Academy, along with its neighboring all-boys school, Notre Dame of Greater Manila opened its doors to coeducation in 1999. When Basic Education Curriculum (BEC) 2002 was launched by the Department of Education, SMACC adopted the Basic Education Department, which reflects a continuous and sequential development from Grades 1 to 10. The Grade School was renamed the Lower Basic Education Department (LBED) and the High School, Upper Basic Education Department (UBED). During the 2003‚Äì2004 school year, the school worked for a certification of its quality management system. On June 25, 2004, the institution was awarded an ISO 9001-2000 certification. SMACC is the first ISO-certified school in all of Caloocan.

In her musical style, she mixes sounds like jazz, blues, bossa nova, ballad, pop, Latin music, cumbia and Mexican rhythms, which essentially makes her genre world music.Rojas, 2010; 25: \\"Ana Diaz. In she style mixing modern sounds like pop to rhythm as trova, jazz, blues ranging from Chile to rock, from bossa nova to the cumbia without leaving behind the essence that characterizes Oaxaca.\\"  Biography  Ana D√≠az was born in Oaxaca. Her mother is from Guadalajara and her father from Sola de Vega. Her love for music and words comes from them. In her most recent work, Ana has approached the Chilean solteca, a genre native to the region, which she inherited from her father's family, particularly her grandmother. Interested from an early age, she began singing as an adolescent. Years later, she attended the Universidad Intercontinental in Mexico City, where she got a degree in communications. Even though she did not study music formally, Ana dedicated herself to taking private singing lessons. Her first teacher was Nayeli Nesme, Mexican singer- songwriter, whose classes she paid for by singing in religious ceremonies on the weekends. She later moved back to Oaxaca and continued her self-taught musical studies. It was there that she associated with other musicians to form different groups, the most significant ones being the duet formed with Oaxacan singer-songwriter Lorenzo Lopez and that formed with Mexican jazz musician Julio Garcia: Reloj de Arena. With Garcia, she began experimenting with musical genres new to her, such as jazz, funk and blues, also taking her to choral music, traditional music and children's music. In 2004, she took up her work as a soloist again and together with Cuban pianist Nilda Brizuela, she recorded one of her most significant works: Clouds of June. It has been fundamental to Ana to not focus her work on one single genre. She has opted for fusing diverse musical forms that she has come in contact with and using them in each of her CD's and compositions. She is a singer, composer, elementary school teacher and businesswoman.  Musical concept  Aside from being a performer, Diaz writes part of the repertory she sings. She selects the rest of the material ranging from folkloric pieces from her native Oaxaca and Mexico to standards of jazz, bossa nova, trova, choral music, children's music, blues, Brazilian rhythms, African rhythms and Latin American folklore. She began by singing trova in 1993. Her concept is based on the fusion of diverse sounds and rhythms with palpable influences from Latin music, soft jazz, blues, pop and rock.  History  Ana was a fellow of the FOESCA grant in 2003 and the PECDA grant in 2010. From the beginning, she has been self- taught. She writes some of the songs she performs with arrangements by musicians like Cuban pianist Nilda Brizuela, jazz musician Julio Garcia and the jazz pianist and guitarist Oscar Rafael Mart√≠nez from Oaxaca. Throughout her career, Ana has worked with such artists as Ernesto Anaya, Mexicanto, Tania Libertad, Lila Downs, Fernando Delgadillo, David Haro, Jose Hinojosa, Gerardo Pe√±a, Carlos Porcel Nahuel, Victor Martinez, Geo Meneses, Hector Infanzon, Lorena y Los Alebrijes and Jaramar, among others, on various stages of Oaxaca and the rest of Mexico. Ana Diaz's music has been transmitted by different media such as television and the Oaxacan state radio. In 2004, she presented her album Life Begins via the Internet on the radio program La Hora M√©xico, transmitted by Radio C√≠rculo de Madrid in Spain which was presented by Alejandro Aura. In March 2007, an interview with her was aired nationally as part of the program Voices Inside for Radio Educaci√≥n. She was interviewed for The National Hour, which airs throughout Mexico, in March 2007, introducing the production of Clouds of June. She devotes herself to promoting her work as a singer-songwriter and performer of contemporary popular music or fusion music giving concerts in various places inside and outside of Oaxaca. She promotes and supports several cultural projects such as the children's compositions by Rene Cortes, with whom she created Guess What, Tangerine, in 1998, a proposal of children's songs, which in 2004 allowed them to produce The Little House of the Sun, a collection of three books and a CD premiered with the Symphony Orchestra of Oaxaca. In 2008, she participated in the album It's Time to Learn about Children's Rights, produced by the State DIF in Oaxaca. In recent years, Diaz has collaborated with the Mexican singer Lila Downs to benefit the Guadalupe Musalem Scholarship Fund in Oaxaca City for poor, indigenous women to continue their studies.[3] At the moment, Diaz is working as a composer, since she recently received the Maria Greever grant, given by well-recognized Mexican institutions such as Auditorio Nacional, the Alfredo Harp Helu Foundation and CONACULTA, among others. This same year she received the award for Best Interpretation at the Mexico, Song of my Heart nationwide contest with her song \\"Arrecifes de Coral\\".

As a result of this inability to propagate, normally incident reststrahlen band radiation experiences strong- reflection or total-reflection from that medium. The energies at which reststrahlen bands occur vary and are particular to the individual compound. Numerous physical attributes of a compound will have an effect on the appearance of the reststrahlen band. These include phonon band-gap, particle/grain size, strongly absorbing compounds, compounds with optically opaque bands in the infrared.  Appearance  Reststrahlen bands manifest in diffuse reflectance infrared absorption spectra as complete band reversal, or in infrared emission spectra as a minimum in emissivity. Application The reststrahlen effect is used to investigate the properties of semiconductors, it is also used in geophysics and meteorology.

The village is accessible by road on Hiritano highway and would take about half-an-hour to travel by motor vehicle. Prior to the roads being built, they used dugout canoes with sails to travel to and fro from Port Moresby. The village is the biggest and oldest settlement in the Kabadi area. Early foreigners came through this area and built churches and schools, before modern services reached the area. The villagers passionately call themselves \\"Abadi Pinu\\". The word \\"abadi\\" refers to power, ownership and prestige by the paramount chief, while \\"Kabadi\\" refers to communal ownership or origin. The word abadi literally means I own and it is synonymous with paramount chief. As the original settlers and owners of all the land in Kabadi, the Pinu people are referred to as Kabadi or Abadi Pinu. It must be also highlighted that the nearby villages such as Ukaukana, Kave ona, Kou ' puana and Magabaira have very close ties to Pinu having broken away from Pinu, therefore, they are also referred to as Kabadi. The local dialect spoken by the Kabadi people is called Abadi. Writer and Linguist, W. Mersh Strong; Note on the Language of Kabadi, British New Guinea Bd. 7, H. 1. (1912), pp. 155‚Äì160, wrote briefly that \\"Kabadi language is spoken in the villages of Vanuapaka, Ukaukana, Kapuana, Keviona, and Matapaile\\". It is still spoken by these villages today with minor changes in adoption of pidgin and English words. It is also crucial to maintain the original language as it linked to the people and their origin. The Summer Institute of Linguist (SIL) has embarked on a project with the people of Kabadi to translate the Bible into Kabadi language and this will immensely preserve the originality of the language. The word 'Kabadi' was recorded by early European Patrols. Literature also recorded it as 'Kabatsi' closely associating it to the Roro-speaking people. Consequently, over time the pronunciation of the word had transformed gradually to Gabadi, and was reinforced and used by Motuan interpreters who accompanied the colonial administrators in the 1600s. It is true that some of the words used today were acquired words and terms from the Motu language, from Motuan interpreters and Motuan-trained missionaries. An anthropologist Dr. W Mesh Strong made an account of Kabadi speaking group in his book page 155‚Äì160, called 'Notes on the Language of Kabadi' 1912. The historical name of Pinu is 'Kabadi' or 'Kabatsi'. Also, the village 'Vanuabaka' or Ma'i vanua was the largest tribe then and it belonged to the paramount chiefs Aro Ure and Ure Vado.  Abadi Pinu  The people are fair skin and generally have a mix of soft and hard afro hair. The women are beautiful, hardworking and cheerful, while their men are solidly built with warrior-like aggression which is attributed to their lifestyle of hunting, fishing and gardening, but more so, to the previous life of migration and post-migration era when they were fully-fledged warriors. The Abadi men were known for their fearlessness, and loyalty to their chief, but today they are peace-loving and go to great lengths to maintain peaceful co- existence with their neighbouring villages. The people are subsistence farmers, hunters and fishermen. The surrounding land is flat, and fertile all year around for gardening. Men organise hunting and fishing trips whenever the need arises to supplement their diet. The Pinu people own the majority of land, beachfront and waterways in the surrounding vicinity of the land extending to Galley Reach rivers and tributaries, much of the land along the Aroa river after the Agevairua bridge, and even portions of land extending towards Nara. The influences of the missionaries and colonial rulers are evident today with order and structure within the village. The village has two lines of houses, with a wide front yard shared by everyone for playing and gathering and many activities. Backyards are planted with coconuts, betelnuts, breadfruits, red bell trees, mangoes and many other trees. The village itself stretches about 5 kilometers in length and about 100 meters wide.  History  = The journey of the seven tribes = A number of migrations took place during the period the Kabadi's descended from Mt Yule. The seven tribes had walked in different directions at different times, but, were heading in the same direction. This is confirmed by their previous settlements along the way including land that they own today. Along the plains of what is called 'Kabadi' today, and even retracing their paths to Meke'o and the Roro land, the Kabadi's still have old sagoes growing in the places that they had settled briefly. The people in those areas still speak of land previously owned by the Kabadis. There were no inhabitants or civilization when the Kabadi's arrived. They settled in different locations on this land; as they progressively advanced at different times and locations strategically for purposes of defense or claiming of land not previously owned. It was not until a couple hundred years later approximately in the late 1700s and early 1800s, that interaction with the Koitabus and Motus, when differences emerged. Even, the Keremas tracked an offender right to the doorstep of the paramount chief and war erupted between Kabadis and Keremas as a result. Consequently, warfare and chaos ensured with horrific battles and murders perpetrated by all parties. Oral history suggests that the Kabadi tribes migrated from the mountains and hinterlands of Maipa and Guari in the misty mountains of Central Province. There were several primary tribes that tracked down through the coast line, while others along the Dilava river. Those on the coast initially settled near the mount of the Aroa River on the other side of Toutu. This place is now called 'U' pore and is claimed by the Ivei baga clan. Today, each of the tribes will lay claim to some portion of land or waterway, depending on their standing with the paramount chief. The waterways were given to the tribe that practices the earthly magical powers of crocodiles, fish calling for harvest, or anything of the rivers and ocean. The grassland was given to those that possess the powers of calling the wallabies, the pigs and birds for purposes of food. However, it is still fact that those close to the paramount chief were given land close to himself. The paramount chief's warriors and close protection spearmen were given more rights and privileges such as land, woman of their choice, and best part of the pig during feast. There is literature confirming this; Dr. W. Mersh Strong has written books depicting events and lives of the Roro- and Mekeo-speaking people, which have much resemblance to the Kabadi people. The writings further confirm these group of people came through Mt. Yule or Kovio. There were waves of migration of different groups of people including the Roros, the Mekeos, the Nara, the Kabadis and finally the Touras who have progressed further east towards present-day city of Port Moresby. This can also be proven through language, lifestyle and traditions of these different groups of people. For example, traditional headdresses, grass skirts, paintings are quite similar except each group differs in slight variation in face paint colors or grass skirt colors. Moreover, languages spoken demonstrate similar traits of sounds vowels and accent between the groups and can be easily understood. This basically demonstrate a coordinated movement of the same group; but at different points in time between one or perhaps two centuries. Evidence of these events are held in oral history and songs composed and passed on from generation to generations and are tightly guarded by the custodians. The Kabadis eventually settled on the plains between the Aroa River stretching towards the beaches along Hisiu to Manumanu, back up the mighty Galley Reach rivers into the mountains. The Kabadi's eventually settled and made these plain home to their individual tribes. The pattern of settlement and ownership of land demonstrated their migration to the eventual village which is now Abadi Pinu. The Kabadis settled and lived in small but robust settlements strategically positioned to protect each other from invaders. The Abadis were constantly at war between the Koitabus, and Motuans and even with their former archrivals, the 'Revos' (Kerema) during the post-migration period. In some of the notes pages 122‚Äì123, 'The Melanesians of British New Guinea' ...many years ago, when the sago western sago trading expedition had gone, the Kabadi, to revenge the murder of one or two of their youths, attacked Lealea, a village in caution bay.. and great massacre took place, upon return of their traders, they wept in great sorrow, and planned to take revenge. 'The Koitabuans assembled in great force. They came from Badili, Barune, Lealea, and all the villages of Lokurukuna and were led by the real Lealeans resolved on signal and terrible revenge'...Lealeans who knew only of one village in Kabadi country, Matapaila. They surrounded it very early one morning when the inhabitants were fast asleep, and killed men, women and children, plundering the village and setting fire to it. A few escaped and they make good use of their time...' There are several other villages in the district, to these the refugees hurried with the tale of woe...soon fresh, strong men, full of wrath and revenge, surrounded the rejoicing victors and the work of death began. A terrible morning it was as only two escaped to tell the tale. This event was also reported by Dr. James Charlmers; of Douras teaming up with a Matapaira, raided a Koitabu tribe; however t,he latter regrouped with the assistance of Manumanus and massacred all the Douras and Matapaira warriors who took part in the attack. The Kabadi people through oral history recorded and passed on by a folk song talks about the Koitabu warlord surrounding Matabaila with his warriors, and attacking the village. Kere, while visiting his concubine sensed the danger and raced all the way to Vanuapaka; gathered reinforcement, return, and the Kabadis surrounded them and murdered all of them, presented the 'price kill' to the paramount chief. The location upon which the battle took place was called Eke'ekena, a splinter tribe of Ivei. Today, the Eke'ekena people lay claim to this location which was renamed after the battle, and today it is called 'Amadi'. The Abadis withstood on-going wars for over two centuries and today stand proud to stake claim to the land they invaded, conquered and live to tell the tale. Oral citations of warriors like 'Boi Pipi' and numerous others are testament to this claim. \\"Tamate\\" also stated in his writings about the Kabadis constant war thus, saw the urgent need for peace. Oral history states seven tribes migrated together and eventually settled on the Kabadi land. The seven tribes had their respective chiefs who were tasked with specific roles. These are head warriors, magicians or sorcerers and messengers and interpreters. To this day, there are still seven tribes with seven clan chiefs. During the arrival of the colonisers, government officials who visited the Abadi plains encouraged people to move and settled together in villages. This was to ensure the Crown accounted for everyone, and to ensure much needed services can be provided to them. The early patrol officers that visited the villages on the Gabadi plain named the villages 'Vanuapaka' which literally means 'big village', due to it been the political and administrative center, while there were satellite villages such as Ukaukana, keveona, Matepaila villages - according to Anthropologist and Author; Ch.G. Seligman who wrote in his book The Melanesians of British New Guinea 'the three best known villages of Kabadi Vanuapaka, kopuana and Ukaukana'. p. 27 subnotes. Even so, other settlements continued to exist around the Abadi plains which grew with families and clans moving to strategic locations for easy access to food, and also protect the lands acquired by the Chief. The main tribe called the Vanuapaka was led by the Paramount Chief Aro Ure Aba moura (I), all the other tribes functioned around the sovereignty of the chief, he issued instructions and was the ultimate law. He personally named and put in place clan leaders, and his word was law. The seven tribes still exist today, but are grouped into three major clans under Pinu village. Today, while there is strong resistance by some of the tribe to these realities, the literature affirms some of these facts, such ownership of land. The 'Queenslander' article dated 27 October 1883 and archived in National Library of Australia highlights an event led by Lawes and Chalmers and Government officials to investigate a land sale dubbed the Pretended Land Sale in New Guinea, page 693(3) states clearly Ure Vado as the rightful owner of land, reiterating that Paramount chiefs ownership of all the land. It is important to note that apart from the seven tribes of Kabadi, the \\"Toura\\" people had moved in the same direction but had settled briefly before moving due to a dispute concerning a woman. Oral history captured in traditional songs had depicted an event where a woman exchange beetle nut with a Toura man at a water well, while the latter ask for drink. The word 'Toura' had its origin at the location where they had briefly settled and their home was burnt to the ground. In the local dialect, the word Toura means to burn. This word had over time changed to 'Doura', and today they are called Doura people. Another wave of migration followed soon after, and this group were the Matapailas. They migrated past the mouth of Galley Reach then resettled inland on Oroi Amoamo, then finally to Auru'u. The neighbouring villages maintain a close relationship with Pinu due to family relations, and are represented by sub clan chiefs or elders who are linked to the Paramount Chief of Abadi Pinu. However, this system is somewhat vague today in terms of authority due to the influence of churches and establishment of government systems. These villages run their own affairs, and the perception of the paramount chief's jurisdiction is rather ceremonial today. Chief system The Chief system of Kabadi is part of its own identity. The Kabadis exist together with this authority since their origin. Both oral history and documents indicate line of Chiefs dating back beyond the arrival of the white man and churches. Estimations indicate generations dating back three centuries or more and can be justified by the achievement of the Chiefs and how they conduct themselves. This in itself demonstrates a system of power, primitive but effective system of governance which has now borne fruits of success generations later. One example is the use of this system by the colonial government to coerce the Kabadis into accepting the government and the early churches by using the chief system. The early penetration by British and Australian government officer's were made possible by the chief through interpreters and the chief's 'remo'. The Chief system of Kabadi people has strong resemblance to the Mekeo, Roro and Nara people.J.F Barton, p. 27 This form of government system is tyrannical in nature, yet had a unique form of administration, with barao or roe for meetings to convene, a policing network that maintained order and peace. Oral history links the Vanuapaka tribe to Kivori and Waima tribes, with family ties still in existence. While this system was basic, it had maintained a well balance power base that kept the tribe together from its migration period between the 1400s and 1600s. During the period of settlement in the 1700s and 1800s, the system somewhat integrated the feudal style power also, with the chief granting lease of land to individuals or families who have made significant contributions to the tribe particular in bravery in warfare, and in participation in conquer of land, or through marriages to the chief family. The ownership of land is centred with the paramount chief, as evident in all documents relating to lease of land in the mid and late 1800s in the Abadi plains, notably the Galley Reach, Camp 48, Rogers Airstrip. Aro Ure and Ure Vado The chiefs held two names which represents power, wealth, and prestige; namely 'Aro Ure I' and 'Ure Ure I'. Two chiefs who were brothers featured prominently in the history of Abadis; The elder Aro Ure was the Paramount Chief, while his younger sibling was a fierce warrior. The chief line is connected to the Waima/ Kivori lineage of Aro Kivori. This lineage still exits with relationships maintained to this day. Today oral history has captured mainly Aro Ure and Ure Vado. It is believed that during the migration period, both Chiefs led the Kabadi's and their men and women to the present locations. Fierce encounters with the Motuan and the Koitabuans resulted in a period of hostility that would have last over two centuries or so; before the period of the London Missionary Society(LMS) in the late 1800s. There were sporadic attacks in revenge by the Kabadis to the east against the Lealeas and Boeras, even Manumanu who had previously settled on the other side of the mouth of galley reach river then. Their raids on the Motuans and the Koitabus further beyond the Abadi plains to capture hunting, fishing, and gardening grounds in the Galley Reach areas and beyond. Legends and folk songs still depict scenes and battle fields of these encounters even in locations as far as Lealea village. This particular detail is important as it states facts about a place and event that occurred then and was named 'kabadi gabugabu'. The Kabadi history bears the hallmark of Ure Ure (Vado Kepo) who had wielded his authority during mid to late 1800s. This was the period of the commencement of peace, and this chief was credited for receiving the white man and churches into the Abadi area. Ure Vado was the younger brother of Aro Ure and had assumed his brother's leadership upon the latter's death. Aro Ure I had a son but was much younger to rule, and as such; Ure Vado assume the title of the chief and commenced his rule. Charmers wrote with interest of the willingness of Paramount chief Ure Vado to end all enmities and open up new trade with the people of the east and west also. Because of his honorable deeds; it is believed that Ure Vado was ordained as a deacon of the early LMS church. Similarly, his successor - Chief Aro Ure (Aba Mokuro), son of his elder brother continued this roll as soon as he assumed chieftainship after the death of Ure Vado. The Kabadi chieftaincy system is patrimonial and only the blood male heir can assume the position of paramount chief. This system is particularly similar is most villages in the west of central province. There is only one instance recorded in literature and spoken of a female chief 'Queen Koloka' inherited the title from her father Naime. But, all Roro and Mekeo villages have male chiefs and this law is particularly upheld. In Kabadi, it is no exception, with much emphasis given to preparation and grooming of the chiefs at a very young age. In oral history, chieftaincy is passed between two brothers in Aro Ure and Ure vado, and cannot be passed onto female siblings, or even bring someone from another tribe in fear of distorting the blood line. Early Church Ure Vado II with the aid of the early colonial government, and the LMS; saw the urgency to develop a policy of peaceful engagement, which was then encouraged by the LMS. James Charlmers saw this as an opportunity to bring peace in the area and end the barbaric culture of ethnic killing. Chief Ure Vado's notable contribution was organising the peace between the Kabadi's and the Motuan's and Koitabu's in 1880s. Rev. James Chalmers noted in one of his many biographies: Ure Vado came in about 8 o'clock. It was interesting to watch the meeting between the Lealeans and him. They rubbed noses and threw their arms around one another, and each expressed great pleasure at this meeting. Ure Vado said, \\"You have never been here before because of our fathers. Enough, let their enmity now die, and here is Kabadi before you to buy yams, bananas, and sugar-cane, whenever you like to come.\\" The others replied \\"Tis because of these, God's men, we are enabling thus to meet: and we shall certainly come here in future for food. Often have we seen the laden canoes of the Boeras and Motuans pass our doors from here and wished we, too, could only secure some, but now we shall be as they are.\\" This event was of such significance as it ushered in a new era of civilized co-existence with neighboring motuans and Koitabuans who would then become trade partners, bringing knowledge and extended network of relationship. Another documented event during this period was to do with a land grab by a Scottish called Andrew Goldie, who had acted on behalf of a Sydney-based syndicate to acquire land in Kabadi under very suspicious circumstance; an Australian newspaper printed this event involving Messrs Goldie and John Cameron prepared a document drawn in legal phraseology‚Äî a land transfer‚Äî which they had brought up to the Mission House for translation, and \\"Armed with this deed, and taking with them a certain amount of ' trade'‚Äî as articles such as hardware, cloth, and tobacco are called in the South Seas ‚Äî they departed. They found a man in occupation of the land they coveted, and generously offered him articles to the value of about ¬£65, which amount would represent about one penny per acre of 15,000. This arrangement suited the wily Papuan in the highest degree, as it subsequently turned out that he was only a tenant under the chief, Ure Vado. On learning this Messrs. Cameron and Goldie returned to Kabadi, taking with them more trade, interviewed the chief, and made terms with him, eventually paying him also an additional penny per acre in articles to the total amount, and taking a further 5,000 acres as a kind of reward.\\" South Australian Register (Adelaide, SA : 1839 - 1900)issue Saturday 19 January 1884. '''  Clans and leadership  The Chief system in the Kabadi area had a well established system of network; whereby; the paramount chief had his Remos (aids), and also clan chiefs who upheld and maintained the rule of law. The rule of law has its own judiciary, policing of the rules, within those communities. The Paramount Chief had the ultimate power of execution as the penalty for offenders; which is pursued through death by sorcery. While this remained a belief; the fear created in myths gave rise to a form of governance that was very effective in the absence of the modern law, policing and judiciary system. The 'Remo' played an important role in the Kabadi Chief system; organising meetings, reported issues to the chief and also was the linked between the chiefs. He possessed special privileges that enabled him to sit face to face with the paramount chief and discussed issues of concern. Today, while the system is somewhat vague with the introduction of Church and the modern government systems, such as the police, the Department of Justice, and the rule of law through other government agencies; the roles and leadership of the chiefs are upheld on a more ceremonial arrangement-but there are still instances where land matters are brought to the attention of the Chiefs to arbitrate. Moreover, it has been proven in the past that the Kabadi's are very passionate people and love and protect their Chief with their lives. The inbuilt warrior spirit remains a hallmark of the Kabadi people; thus if provoked, they will not hesitate to defend themselves. Pinu village has three major clans who are very much made up of extended families. The three clans are governed by clan chiefs and elders recognised through their contributions to their clans. While the political system is firm, other prominent individuals take leadership roles to assist in the betterment of the village. These clan chiefs and leaders are empowered to organise meetings, deal with social problems, and occasionally meet with the paramount chief. The Paramount Chief in most cases has a final say in important issues that need attention. Historians; Dr. W. Mersh Strong and J. F Barton notes listed 'Vanuapaka, Kopuana and Ukaukana have clubhouses or roe's (p. 27); he further listed 'itsubus' in order of significance; 'Ovia Kupunu (Ovia Kubuna), Koiitunu (Kerekubuna), Ivena (Ivei Baga), Idibana, kopuana, Au kupunu (Ukaukana), Muri Kupunu (Ukaukana) and Poio Kupunu. Some of these tribes would have perished or tribe or family names would have naturally evolved over time, and this is possible when intermarriages and deaths occur over centuries. Therefore, Pinu village consists of three major clans; Ovia Kubuna, Ivei, and Eu Age, while other Kabadi clans include Ukaukana, Koupuana, Keveona; with families breaking away and forming satellite clans along the Aroa river. = Vanuapaka = Vanuapaka village is an important village in the history of Kabadi's. This village is significant given that this was the paramount chief's village, and lots of literature had given this name, somewhat an indication that this was the main village at the time in history. Vanuapaka was perfectly described by Author: H M Dauncey, in his book titled 'Papuan Pictures', * A Project Gutenberg Australia eBook; 'Vanuabaka is at the end of a long creek leading out of the main river. The houses are scattered about under the tall cocoanuts, which, as you will see in the picture, appear to be trying to get out of the ground in which they are growing. This peculiar appearance is probably the result of the continual sweeping up of the village, and sometimes the people find it necessary to place wattle fences around the roots and fill in with the sweepings of the village. Here, unlike Nara, the houses are all separate, and neighbours are given rather a wide berth. Timoteo's house stands near the centre of the village inside a neat fence. His wife, with true Samoan hospitality, has wreathed vines and flowers not only round the verandah posts, and along the front of the house, but even round the posts of the home-made bedstead and over the wall of the small room devoted to our use. Vanuapaka in Kabadi language literally means big village, in some of the old texts and writings in the 1880s by anthropologists, linguists and historians, Vanuapaka was writian and \\"Hanuabada\\". In recent times, the village was arranged in clans and given the clan name Ovia Kubuna. Ovia Kubuna literary means Obia or Ovia ‚Äì chief; and Kubunu or Kubuna ‚Äì Offspring; line or generation of chief. Historian Dr. Strong noted that the Kabadi's main clan was called Vanuapaka literally meaning big village and this tribe had club houses or baraos as it is commonly known. This is a significant statement as the paramount chief, must have a barao, with the smaller tribes also owning roe's, signifying authority and status. Ovia Kubunu clan is the central clan and it is made up of the Paramount chief, his nucleus family and the extended family, while three other sub-clans namely Kere Kubuna, Iramana and Roro'o Badina, also are associated with the main clan for traditional and cultural obligations. The clan is strategically placed to be in the middle as a symbol of authority, with modern government services such as schools, health services and church infrastructure all located here. The clan has about eighteen households with a small population of about two hundred and fifty men, women and children. Both Ovia Kubuna and Kere Kubuna clans hold some of the biggest parcels of land on the Kabadi plains, the Toutu beach, Galley Reach, and certain portions of land on the Kabadi plain within the vicinity of the village. A noticeable trend is inter-marriages between the sub clans. However, sub-clans from Ovia kubuna have the mandatory role of providing the support to the chief and continue to uphold and protect this institution. Keve 'ona (Ka ve'o) Keveona village is also located in the Gabadi Area near the Aroa river. Keveona people have close relations with the Ovia kubuna people. The paramount Chief Aro Ure I had courted a woman of Nara royalty and had a son called Naime. When Naime reached his adulthood, he was instructed by Aro Ure I to come and settle on the empty land; which was 'Ka veo' or no man's land. His instructions were to oversee the vast land. Naime had married and bore children, and his family had grown with inter-marriages, and with others from elsewhere coming in to establish the village of Keveo. To this day, the family has very close relations to the Ovia kubuna clan and still maintains the relationship. Naime was given permission to work the land but not own. He bore a woman and named her after his mother 'Koloka. When Koloka reached her adulthood, in early 1960, Ure Vado sent his man and woman to initiate Koloka as a leader of her tribe. It is not common for women to hold leadership roles such as chief, however, it was made an exception given she was the lineage of Aro Ure. It was also reported in the 1890s that Naime collaborated with Baru Oko of Magabaira to sell land to a Sydney syndicate represented by GOldie and Cameron. Both men pushed the sale of land totaling 20,000 acres, through Naime and Baru. When the report of this sale reached the authorities, UreVado from Vanuapaka protested to the Commonwealth and the sale was reversed. The sale which was dubbed \\"Controversial Land deal\\" by the Australian news reporters due to the immense publicity it attracted. Consequently, Governor Scratchely was summoned by the Common Wealth to investigate and report back, he visited Kabadi and met with UreVado and discussed in length the issue concerning the land deal. This event was captured in a book titled ‚ÄòPicturesque New Guinea‚Äô dated 1887, Chapter V. Excursion up the Aroa River‚Äô, and authored by J. W. Lindt, that Sir Peter Scratchley's principal visit to Kabadi was to establish contact with local chiefs, on page 41, the writer stated that \\"After dinner, Ure Vado, the head chief of Kabadi, was introduced, attired in European fashion, in an old Crimean shirt with a string of beads round his neck. Naieme Eru (sub-chief of Kabadi from Ukaukana) sat beside him, and a palaver then commenced, Mr. Chalmers (James) translating for the High Commissioner‚Äôs benefit the chief‚Äôs opinion of Cameron‚Äôs land transaction\\". = Ivei Clan = Ivei clan is consist of two main original clans; Ivei baga and Eke'ekena clans. Other important clans are Idibana and Maokona. Today, the Ivei clan is the biggest clan of the Kabadi, with over fifty households, with a population of over one thousand men, women and children. This figure is subject to confirmation, and has to be reviewed with latest population data. This clan lay claim to some of the land around the Galley Reach, and the stretch of Toutu Beach along with the other two clans. The men and women of this clan are avid hunters and proud traditional dancers. = Eu Age = The third clan is the second-largest and is made of sub-clans; Vanua Irama, Agorena, Ure Ema & Goidu. This clan is the second-largest clan after Ivei with about twenty-three households with a population of about three hundred and fifty. This clan lays claim to most of the waterways along the Agevairua/Aro river down to the Toutu beach. The people are skilled seafaring people and use this means to garden and fish for their upkeep, or exchange goods along the coast during peaceful periods. The second-largest clan is headed by a chief and supported by sub- clan chief. The chief holds a seat in the paramount chiefs table. Ukaukana Ukaukana is a village situated North West of Pinu and has very close relations to Pinu village and its people. In the 1880s there existed a strong political system that linked the villages together. During this period, literature; showed that Ukaukana had a sub-chief called Naime Eru. In fact, it was noted in a book titled ‚ÄòPicturesque New Guinea‚Äô dated 1887, Chapter V. Excursion up the Aroa River‚Äô, and authored by J. W. Lindt, that Sir Peter Scratchley's principal visit to Kabadi was to establish contact with local chiefs, on page 41, the writer stated that \\"After dinner, Ure Vado, the head chief of Kabadi, was introduced, attired in European fashion, in an old Crimean shirt with a string of beads around his neck. Naieme Eru (sub-chief of Kabadi from Ukaukana) sat beside him, and a palaver then commenced, Mr. Chalmers (James) translating for the High Commissioner‚Äôs benefit the chief‚Äôs opinion of Cameron‚Äôs land transaction\\" pp 41. To this day, both villages enjoy a cordial relationship with inter-marriages and relations even dating back many decades. Naime Eru had a close relationship with Ure Vado, but had family ties to the Euage clan. Writer; HM Dauncy or Doncy as known to the local people wrote a lot about the Ukaukana people including their Chief Naime Eru.  Recent settlements  Auru'u village Magabaila village grew out of 'Auru'u village. Auru'u was the first settlement where the Oroi migrants had settled. They had previous settled at a location called Oroi Amo before moving on to Auru'u. The village today is called Magabaira and is located north of Pinu village about 2 hours' walk through the bush land. The 'Magabaira' people had previous migrated from Oroi, near Manavuro. This tribe is closely linked to ancient Mekeo tribes, and was call the 'Afai' tribe, when it broke away from them. Writer and anthropologist Seligman, wrote extensively about this tribe and their association with the 'Kookaburra' story, how, a fight erupted as a result of difference of opinion about the sound of laughter coming from the bird, 'was it from the mouth, or the rectum'. This incident has proven to be the most important event in the destiny of the Magabaira people today. They migrated through roro land near Kivori, before proceeding on to the coast near present-day Delena, and then progressing by canoe to the island off the present day Manumanu, when they were discovered by the Kabadi warriors. Upon the chief's instructions, they were settled on the mainland near Toutu beach, a location called 'Oroiamoamo'; called such due to the brief settlement of the Oroi migrants. = Hisiu Village = During the late 1800s, and early 1900s, the paramount chief of Pinu, welcomed Roro speaking settlers from the west to settle and established a village now called Hisiu. The Pinu and Hisiu people enjoy a cordial relationship. There are inter marriages, and social activities between the two villages which continue to exist today. A coconut plantation was established during the colonial era were copra was produced for export; with most of the labour recruited from Hisiu and Pinu villages. The plantations ceased operations in late 1970s, and remnants of the colonial built houses that housed the plantation managers and worker still stand today. Hisiu beach has also become a popular weekend destination for people from Port Moresby who travel up there just to enjoy the natural beauties that exist. = Manumanu Village (Morabi) = Manumanu village was established in the late 1850s at the mouth of Galley. The Motuan speaking people had briefly settled at Morabi, but was driven out by the Kabadi's through battles. The Motuans were constantly scattered by the sporadic raids from the Kabadi's until, the crown officials had to step in and put an end to this madness. Governor WM Macgregor did a brief report to the crown dated 11 December 1890, page 25‚Äì26 in the report he stated details and accounts of the paramount chief Ulivado(Ure Vado) of Hanuabada, or Vanuapaka, would prove to be a difficult person to deal with. This report highlight four deaths, a Koitabuan, a motuan and two Kabadi's. The Crown authority had gone to investigate with the intent to arrest the culprits. It was recorded that Ulivado was locked behind some iron bars as a punishment. The Manumanus had an alliance with the Koitabu's and there were battles between these tribes over a long period of time. However, the Crown authorities and missionaries such as James Charlmers pioneered peace between the people, and the Kabadi chief made a pledge to end wars in the area. This peace accord has since lasted till today. The villages continued to enjoy a strong relationship due to the use of road network, also through marriages, and exchange of food and various other goods and services. = Toutu Village = Other settlements that were established during this period include the Toutu village where families of former plantation workers with South East Asian origins came to work in the coconut plantations owned and operated by the Dutch New Guinea Company in the early 1800s. The Dutch ceased their business's thereafter and left with some workers while others continued to live amongst the Kabadi people. A particular individual will set his own destiny and live in Kabadi. This man called kassimani made a crucial decision in his lifetime by standing firm against a white plantation manager abusing a local worker. He met his fate and was terminated, told to pack up and leave; upon hearing his fate, the Kabadi's and the chief invited him to settle at Toutu. Kassimani's relationship would grow with the Chief, would play an important role in assisting the people of Kabadi in the years to come.  Arrival of the churches  The church had played a significant role in transforming the lives of the people. In the late 1800s, the London Missionary Society, landed in the area, and established stations, where the church and schools were built. The role and influence of the church then was made much easier with the approval of the Paramount chief, who then welcomed the early church to establish themselves in Pinu village. A church building was established with a school built to teach the people about God and basic English and maths. Everyone was forced to embrace this change, which subsequently led to people converting and accepting Christianity. London Missionary Society (LMS) Rev. James Chalmers. Rev. Timoteo Rev. Piri Most traditional and customary beliefs have now given way to modern lifestyles with the establishment of government schools, with a wave of young people graduating and moving away to other provinces for education or work and bring back a change of thought pattern. Also more recently with the introduction of media, both print and airwaves, electronic gadgets, have now transformed the lives of Pinu people. In spite of this the people continue to identify themselves well; with a deep passion of sense of belonging to their tribe and its historical past. They are also very committed in their Christian faith, and serve their God with passion. A permanent church building was subsequently built in the 1960s which still stands where the old church and school were built, and today the area is called the station. There are two churches that are active, namely, the United, which is the foundation church, and more recently, the Christian Revival Church 'CRC', a mainstream church. Both churches have significantly contributed to the spiritual upkeep of the village people, and also maintain their respective church buildings which are used for Sunday worships and weekly gatherings. Both churches conduct activities and have established groups for Youths, women folk, and children to engage them in the activities. The churches ensure young men and women are taught in the principles and teachings of the Bible. There are also leaders elected to the church to ensure they manage important issues that concern the mandate of the church.  Government services  Colonial Era. Present Era. Pinu village falls under the political jurisdiction of Kairuku Hiri District with its district headquarters at Bereina. The political representation is under Kairuku Rural consisting of 17 Local Level Government (LLG)councils, represented by their respective elected councillors. The 17 LLGs elect a Council president who represents them in the Provincial Assembly. The provincial Assembly is responsible for ensuring services such as infrastructure in the form of roads, bridges, schools, health centres are established and maintained each year. The Provincial Assembly is chaired by the Provincial Governor, unless otherwise the incumbent holds a portfolio in the National Parliament, the chair position is voted for within the provincial assembly. Pinu village has an elementary school and community school together covering Elementary Prep to Grade 8. The School is part of government school system that was originally a church school establish by London Missionary Society - LMS in early 1960s. The Government took full control of it after independence in 1975. By then it had already produce students that were attending Della Salle High School and Iarowari High School for the male students and Our ladies of Sacred Heart (OLSH) High School, and Marinville High School for the female students. There were also a few students that were attending Sogeri and Kerevat National High School, and many of them have gone on to tertiary institutions and other technical colleges. These elite group of Pinu people today hold some very senior positions both in the Public Service, and the private sector. Most of them today enjoy the privileges of their own success, and live and work in the city of Port Moresby and elsewhere, and in turn, enlist their own children in private schools and government schools in the urban areas. Most of them have also contributed significantly to the development of this country in their respective duties, and also given their share of resources to Pinu Village. Other services include the health service which is run by a medical orderly, and treat patients from the village and the nearby villages. There is no proper water supply, and the villagers draw water from the wells, and catch rain water for drinking, cooking and laundry. A river tributary flows close to the village and it is used for bathing and laundry. It is also well documented that the road system to the village is in atrocious condition, and is inaccessible during rainy seasons. Pinu people, including Manumanu and Toutu are disadvantaged during the wet periods, and have to walk long hours to get to the main highway, or use sea transport to access Port Moresby for goods and services.  Projects  In the early 1980s, a project was initiated between the people of Pinu and Ilimo Farm to farm Shogum. This project got off the ground and was managed by the Incorporated Land Owner group called Abadi Business Group. The business group was managed by locals the project was a success up until the Ilimo Farm ceased operations, and this caused the business to restrategise to sustain itself. despite many attempts to progress their business plans, the land owner group eventually ceased operations. It is believed small amounts of funds invested with commercial banks still earn a minimum interest and it is yet to be claimed. The Abadi Business group has since been deregistered by Investment Promotion Authority. in the 1990s, the European Union through its Aid agency, built a solar operated pump system to pump water from underground water system to supply the village. Each clan was supplied with four thanks with taps to be accessed by each homes, however, this system has since ceased, with all tanks rusted and destroyed. This has somewhat put a huge burden on the women folk who have now resorted to fetching water from wells, which are sometimes unhealthy due to proximity of hole toilets. In 2010, a group was formed by people from Pinu, Manumanu and Toutu villages to basically seek to improve the roads leading to their respective villages. The people had faced hardship, as at times they would be cut off from accessing utilities and services in the city. The group somewhat achieve their purpose merely as a pressure group, pushing the local member of Parliament Hon. Paru Aihi to improve the road. The Governor made possible some funds which were given and expedited for the project. However, this upgrade was short-lived the following year when the wet season reverted the condition of the road to its initial state. In 10 May 2012, two separate print media reported the elected member of Parliament, Hon. Paru Aihi, making a pledge of five million kina to the Pinu people from the LNG developer as part of its responsibility for the 'gas pipeline corridor' who will be affected by the pipeline. The funding was channeled through the provincial government, and will be drawn and paid to the contractor to build a proper all-weather road from the main highway all the way to Manumanu, including the Toutu road. Unfortunately, this project has not taken off, with the funds yet to be received, or has been diverted to other projects. There were talks in 2012 about a rice project to be initiated by a Naima group, and endorsed by relevant authorities to farm rice on the Abadi plains. Meetings were organised by the stakeholders and the landowners; however, according to the Abadis, it is crucial to recognise the authority to the land itself first. While the rice project has pushed for Incorporate Land Groups to be formed, Abadi Pinu must chair, let alone be lead negotiators in, any project to be introduced and implemented on the Abadi plains because, historically, Chiefs Aro Ure and Ure Vado have been documented as signatories to all previous land mobilisation programs. The Abadis have also incorporated an ILG with the Lands Department in anticipation of any future projects in the Abadi plains.  Additional information  In the mid 1800s, a portion of land was sold by a custodian called Naime Arua near Kabadi, to a syndicate. Two names were prominent; Cameron and Goldie, while, texts in archives show that both were acting on behalf of a Sydney syndicate. Goldie had previously decided to settle in New Guinea. In May 1878 he had bought land near Hanuabada and set up a trading store. In September 1883 he joined J. B. Cameron, agent of a Sydney syndicate, in buying 17,000 acres (6880 ha) at Kabadi. This purchase defied native custom and poisoned his good relations with William Lawes. On the establishment of the protectorate Goldie and Cameron sought recognition of the transaction and parted company when it was refused. In 1886 the government decided to remove European settlement from the Hanuabada area. In exchange for his property Goldie was offered six blocks in the new township at Granville West but after a vigorous paper war with Anthony Musgrave was compensated with ¬£400 for his improvements, and given fifty suburban acres (20 ha) and three town allotments on which he built Port Moresby's first store in January 1887. Despite a report of his death in 1886 Goldie visited Sydney in 1891 but died soon after his return to Port Moresby on 20 November. Although evidence on his estate was destroyed in World War II, he left 3750 shares in Burns Philp & Co. Ltd to three sisters and two brothers. The archives further showed that the paramount chief of Kabadi disputed the land deal. His argument was on the fact that the said culprit; Naime Arua was never the owner, but a custodian. A public court was initiated where Naime Arua admitted to not owning the land and it was Paramount Chief of Kabadi Ure Vado that owned all the land. In the course of all of these events, missionary James Charlmers protested to the British Empire by formally writing a letter through the Queensland and New Zealand court system. Moreover, Governor Schratchley had taken a personal interest in the land saga and had done his own investigations with documented facts presented to the authorities. The Governor also presented the case to the Crown; citing the land transactions illegal. His writings have also indicated the true land owner was Ure Vado and his nephew, Aro Ure. The facts are fascinating given this had saga had transpired in the late 1890s. Land grabbing amongst the Anglo-Saxons during this period was prevalent in the continents of Africa, Asia and the Empires were sensitive to this trend. More and more civilized nations were speaking against grabbing of land from the natives, and newspapers were hot on the trail of such incidents. Consequently, these events are well documented and much of it was published in newspaper documents, and writings by early anthropologists and missionaries. The administration was up and running by the early 1900s, and by 1908, an important occasion took place which a signing ceremony between the landowners and the Crown, effectively transferring ownership of the Galley Reach area to the Crown or State for a 99 years lease. The Department of Lands and Physical Planning issued a 'Notice To Treat' through the provincial lands authority as soon as the 99-year lease had expired. The Abadi Pinu Land Group Incorporation (ILG) Chairman and his executive then submitted in response to this notice. Under the Lands Act 1996, Section 12 subsection (2) the ILG notes gross abuse of process by the State agent, as provisions that protect the rights of the indigenous owners was not adhered to with the Abadi Pinu ILG not receiving the response in the given time. Even, subsection (5) calls for compensation, which did not eventuate. More recently, towards the end of 2015, the Department issued notices of compulsory acquisitions of portion 406, 421,422,423,424, and further acquisitions in January 2016 for renewal of Agricultural Leases under section 120 (2) portion 149, 150, 151, 154, 185, 189,142, 196,148, 195, 134, all of which are under Milinch Manu, Fourmil Aroa, Central Province. Tragically, The real owners, the Abadi Pinu, Kabadi people have not benefited at all. The Companies listed are British New Guinea Development Limited, Kanosia Estates Limited, and Veimauri Plantantions Ltd, and there is an urgent need to verify and cross-check all the record and whether due process was adhered to by the agent of the State. This document and various other lease- related documents prove beyond doubt the ownership of the land area of Abadi, and the authority that existed and was recognised then. To this day, the social structure and authority still exist today, and has stood the change of times, a testament to the people of Abadi-Pinu. 'Manumanu Land 2015‚Äì2016.' In late 2015 the Government of Papua New Guinea though its various agencies had instituted and acted through the Defense Policy to identify land in the Kabadi Area to build infrastructure for the Papua New Guinea Defense Force. The corresponding actions led to the department of Lands and Physical Planning issuing Gazzetal Notices in late December 2015 of compulsory acquisition of land in Kabadi. Ironically, this land is linked to the actual land deal transacted by Cameron and Goldie in 1883. References *BRITISH NEW GUINEA.

The actress successfully auditioned for the role of Dani in 1999 and she called the experience incredible. Sursok considered herself lucky to get the part, as the audition was the first one she had had since acquiring an agent. She made her first screen appearance as Dani during the episode broadcast on 19 June 2000. After four years in the role, Sursok made the decision to leave Home and Away in 2004 to pursue a music career and other acting opportunities and as a result Dani departed the series on 12 November 2004. She later explained that she had also become frustrated with the serial's producers. Sursok was glad that her character was written out of the show without anything bad happening to her. Dani was introduced to Home and Away along with her family, who came to Summer Bay to take over the running of the local caravan park. Dani was initially against moving to the Bay as she thought the town was \\"tame\\". The character was described as being strong, independent and a bit of a rebel by a writer for the show's official website. She was also confident and high spirited. Dani developed relationships with three of the serial's male characters; Will Smith (Zac Drayson), Josh West (Daniel Collopy) and Scott Hunter (Kip Gamblin). Dani's first major storyline occurred in 2001, when she was raped by Kane Phillips (Sam Atwell). Sursok called the assault the worst thing that had ever happened to her character. Dani later hit Kane with her car and was sent to prison after being found guilty of attempted murder. In her later storylines, Dani was harassed by two stalkers. Sursok won the Most Popular New Female Talent Logie Award in 2001 for her portrayal of Dani. Casting After acquiring an agent when she was fourteen, Sursok's first audition was for a role in Home and Away in 1999. Sursok received the role of Dani, the eldest daughter of the Sutherland family, who took over the running of the Caravan Park.Mercado 2004, p.264. The actress considered herself lucky to get the part, calling the experience \\"incredible\\". She told a writer for TeenHollywood, \\"It was my first audition, so I thought it always worked like that, and you always get your first audition, but that is not the case.\\" Sursok left Home and Away in 2004, so she could pursue a music career and acting opportunities in the United States. The actress explained \\"I'm 21 and it's time to be more creative. It is scary, but I had to leave before I became stale.\\" Sursok later revealed that her frustration with the soap's producers also contributed to her exit. When asked if she was happy with how she was written out of Home and Away, Sursok stated that she wanted \\"something completely dramatic\\", but she was glad that nothing bad happened to her character, so she could always return to the show. Development =Characterisation= Dani arrives in Summer Bay from the city with her parents Rhys (Michael Beckley) and Shelley (Paula Forrest), and her sisters Kirsty (Christie Hayes) and Jade (Kate Garven). Dani does not want to be there and wishes she was back in the city, as she was forced to leave her older boyfriend behind when her family moved. She was not happy about living in the Bay, which she thought was \\"tame\\", and became convinced that her parents just wanted to keep her apart from her boyfriend. Dani is \\"quite vocal\\" and makes her family's lives miserable. A writer for the official Home and Away website said Dani \\"missed the excitement of sneaking into a pub for a night out with her girlfriends.\\" The writer also commented that Dani just wanted to \\"turn 18, finish school and move out of home.\\" When Dani learned that her mother had returned to work, despite promising not to, she rang her boyfriend to beg him to take her away. Dani was later forced to take on the responsibility of looking after her younger sisters when her parents began to work long hours. She started to resent Shelley's job as a social worker and began to revolt. Dani was described as being \\"a bit of a rebel without a cause.\\" Sursok proclaimed that unlike Dani, she is \\"a very positive person who considers life a journey.\\" A writer for the Home and Away: Official collectors edition magazine noted that Dani was always confident and \\"high spirited\\", but she was \\"broken\\" after she was attacked. =Relationships= Dani's first relationship was with Will Smith (Zac Drayson). The writer's used the young couple to explore the subject of taking a relationship to a physical level. The character were seen on-screen discussing sex. However, \\"all hell breaks loose\\" when Dani learned that Will was hoping to have sex with her after the school formal. Sursok explained that when her character saw a condom fall out of Will's wallet, she was horrified, especially as her father was there too. The actress continued, \\"The sad thing is even though Will is a bit ahead of himself, he's actually doing the responsible thing by carrying a condom. But Dani doesn't see it that way.\\" Dani made the decision not to speak to Will and refuses to go to the formal, thinking that everything is \\"ruined\\". Will tried to win Dani back when she decided to go to the formal after all and succeed. Will later got Gypsy Nash (Kimberley Cooper) pregnant during \\"a brief fling\\", while he and Dani were going through a rough patch in their relationship. Kilmeny Adie from the Illawarra Mercury believed that Dani never quite got over Will and her feelings were \\"not made easier\\" when she learned that Will and Gypsy had got engaged soon after the birth of their daughter. In November 2001, Josh West (Daniel Collopy) was introduced to the serial and became a love interest for Dani. Dani and Josh began dating, but their relationship was filled with \\"ups and downs\\". The couple briefly broke up and Sursok noted that the relationship had come down to \\"silly mind games and petty arguments.\\" Dani and Josh realised that they had overcome many problems and dramas, but instead of being there for each other and appreciating what they had, they \\"lost sight of why they are together\\". Following another argument, Dani spoke to Hayley Smith (Rebecca Cartwright) about their problems and decided that she and Josh needed to stop being silly and talk through their issues. After an \\"honest and emotional discussion\\", the couple realised that what they had was special and called a truce to their arguments. After her relationship with Josh ended, Dani began dating Scott Hunter (Kip Gamblin). She first met Scott on the beach, where he was riding his horse. Two weeks later, they met again and Alf Stewart (Ray Meagher) informed Dani that Scott had invested in the boat shed and was trying to escape city life. Dani soon landed a date with Scott and was \\"instantly swept away by his charms.\\" The arrival of Scott's young sister, Kit (Amy Mizzi), caused problems between Scott and Dani as they contended with her alcoholism. Dani was dismayed when her father invited Kit to move into his home, on the condition that she stop drinking. Gamblin told Jason Herbison from Inside Soap, \\"Scott is happy because he thinks it will help her, but it really complicates things for him and Dani. Their relationship is going well and the Sutherlands like him, but now Kit could mess it up.\\" Dani and Scott later became engaged and stayed together until Dani's departure in 2004. =Sexual assault= Dani finds herself drawn to the rebellious Kane Phillips (Sam Atwell) even though everyone knows he is \\"bad news\\". Sursok commented that there is something about him that fascinates Dani and she is also aware that he comes from a troubled background, but blames his brother for his behaviour. Dani and her boyfriend Will Smith start having problems in their relationship and Dani begins flirting with Kane, eventually kissing him. She feels guilty afterwards and tries to get Kane out of her head. Sursok told Inside Soap's Jason Herbison \\"After Dani kisses Kane, she knows it's wrong and decides not to take it any further. The problem is, Kane really wants Dani, and he won't take no for an answer.\\" One day, Kane helps Dani carry some shopping home and he comes on to her. When Dani tries to stop him, Kane pins her down and sexually assaults her. Describing the scenes, Sursok stated \\"She tries to resist, but he gets violent and forces her. You don't see what happens next, but you get the idea.\\" The actress explained that the censorship laws in Australia stopped producers from using the word \\"rape\\", but viewers will be left in no doubt that Dani was the victim of a serious crime. Sursok told Herbison that the assault is the worst thing that has ever happened to Dani and she feels that she is somehow to blame because she did come on to Kane. Sursok admitted that she had trouble sleeping while the episodes were being filmed and the thought of being in Dani's shoes was all it took for her to give a convincing performance. The actress called the storyline \\"very important\\" and commented that children have to know that that kind of behaviour was not acceptable. Sursok later became frustrated with the producers after the scenes involving Dani's attack were cut. Sursok said \\"For me as an actor the rape storyline was really good, but unfortunately they ended up cutting everything and we had to re-shoot the whole thing because it was too emotional and too intense.\\" The actress admitted that was the moment she thought the show was not realistic as the storyline went from being a rape to an attack. Sursok added that it was quite hard for her as the scenes had been some of her best and she had received many letters from viewers telling her she had helped them. Dani later learned that her sister, Kirsty, had begun a relationship with Kane and was horrified by her betrayal.Mercado 2004, p.266. Kirsty insisted that Kane was her soulmate, while a \\"furious\\" Dani threatened to break them up.Mercado 2004, p.270. =Prison= Maitland Gaol in New South Wales served as the prison in which Dani was incarcerated for hitting Kane with her car. Sursok said her experience inside Maitland was \\"quite realistic\\". Dani later injures Kane after she hits him with her car and she is sent to prison when she is found guilty of attempted murder. The storyline unfolded through a series of flashbacks. The episode begins in the present and then goes through time to reveal what happened in the previous twenty-four hours. Sursok revealed that she was \\"really excited\\" when she got the scripts and that she had gone to the scriptwriters a few months earlier and asked for her character to be given some big storylines. Sursok explained that the first thing viewers see is Dani behind the wheel of her car, wiping tears from her eyes. It is obvious Dani is upset about something, but it is not clear what about. She then hears a loud bang, which sounds like she has run something over. Dani gets out and when she sees blood, she assumes she has hit a kangaroo. Dani panics when she sees headlights coming towards her and she gets back in the car and leaves the scene. The episode then goes back to the previous day where Dani's boyfriend, Scott, is seen punching Kane as he believes he is taking advantage of Kirsty. Sursok stated \\"It ends in this huge argument, and Dani and Kirsty are at loggerheads. Dani simply can't take much more. After that, Scott tries to comfort Dani and suggests that she might need professional help to get through this. And that's what tips Dani over the edge - she feels like Scott is suggesting she has a problem when, in fact, it's all Kane's fault.\\" Dani becomes distressed and gets into her car and drives straight to her \\"sleazy\\" university lecturer, Ross McLuhan (Angelo D'Angelo), because she knows that he will tell her what she wants to hear. Sursok told Herbison that Dani is not thinking straight and wants to run away from her problems. As he is comforting her, Ross kisses Dani and she responds. However, she realises that it is wrong and that is when she gets back in the car and drives off. The episode then returns to where it started, but this time viewers see that Dani has hit Kane with her car. Noah Lawson (Beau Brady) finds an unconscious Kane by the side of the road and Dani is soon under suspicion of attempted murder. She tells Kirsty that she thinks she ran over a kangaroo, but then her father reveals that Kane was hit by a car and is in the hospital. Sursok added \\"People can't help but wonder is she did it on purpose - and that includes her father and Scott. Dani is shocked that people could even think that. She would never try to kill anyone - but how can she convince them?\\" Dani is arrested and ends up in court charged with attempted murder, where she is found guilty and sent to prison. Maitland Gaol served as the prison that Dani was sent to. Scenes involving Maitland were shot in September 2003. On Dani's experience inside, Linda Barnier and Andrew Waugh from The Newcastle Herald stated \\"Dani adopts a tough persona to survive her first day in the Big House. But it's just a ruse the real Dani's just a scared little girl.\\" Dani initially finds herself being bullied by Viv \\"The Guv\\" Standish (Maggie Kirkpatrick) inside. However, she eventually earns Viv's respect. Viv takes Dani under her wing and even offers to help with her appeal. Sursok enjoyed the changed of pace for Dani, who had started to become \\"one of the more solid, dependable characters.\\" The actress told The Sun-Herald's Scott Ellis \\"I said [to the producers] I know I've been established with all my storylines, but I really want to be able to push myself and really work with something ... they said 'OK, well you're going to jail'. I asked for something new and I definitely got it.\\" Dani is later released from prison, but Tricia Martin and Sarah Ellis from Inside Soap commented that she should have stayed inside because then viewers would have been spared the first Summer Bay stalker, Felix Walters (Josh Lawson). =Stalkers= Josh Lawson portrayed Dani's stalker, Felix Walters. Felix stalked Dani and she struggled to cope with his constant harassment. When Dani went to confront her stalker at the university, she became aware of someone following her and she lashed out at her potential assailant. However, she soon discovered that she had accidentally attacked The Dean (Philip Holder). Felix was beaten up and he died in hospital. When Dani received a letter from Maitland Prison, she became convinced she knew who had committed the crime. Dani realised that she would have to return to the prison, where she was incarcerated for a time, to meet with the letter writer. Sursok told a TV Week reporter, \\"She thinks she has to sort it out. She goes back to the prison even though she doesn't want to. It brings up a lot of bad memories. But she has to go there and figure it out for herself.\\" The author of the letter and the person who ordered the attack of Felix turned out to be Viv. Dani then realised that she may be an accessory to Felix's murder. It was later revealed that Felix was administered a fatal dose of crystal meth by his girlfriend and accomplice, Sarah Lewis (Luisa Hastings- Edge).Mercado 2004, p.272. However, Sarah blamed Dani and Scott for Felix's death. She then began stalking and victimising them and some of their friends. Sarah set Dani up to have her hands burned by toxic chemicals, which left her with \\"a really fragile frame of mind.\\" Sarah's victims later came together to try and ensure that she was sent to prison, instead of a mental hospital where she could be freed early. Sarah invited her victims to a counselling session and Detective Peter Baker (Nicholas Bishop) suggested that they try and provoke her into confessing to her crimes. Sursok called the situation \\"particularly traumatic\\" for Dani. When Sarah escaped from her psychiatric institution, she returned to the Bay to get revenge for Felix. Dani tried to get to a safe house, but Sarah got to her first and kidnapped her. Sarah then shot and killed Noah, before turning the gun on herself. Storylines Dani, her mother, father and two younger sisters move to Summer Bay to take over the running of the local caravan park. Dani is initially unhappy about having to move from the city to the Bay and she later calls her boyfriend, Kel (Ben Tate), to come and take her away. Kel eventually shows up and Dani tries to talk to him about their future. Kel turns nasty and Will Smith comes to Dani's rescue. Dani complains when her mother gets involved in social work, saying that she is putting her career before the family. Dani also become fed up with her sisters not helping out enough. Dani befriends Will and they later begin dating. Dani also becomes close friends with Brodie Hanson (Susie Rugg), who her parents foster. Dani and Will's relationship hits a rough patch when Dani becomes jealous of Will's friendship with Gypsy Nash. Dani flirts with Kane Philips and kisses him, but immediately regrets it. When Kane helps Dani carry some shopping home, he comes on to her and she rejects him. But Kane does not take no for an answer and he rapes her. Brodie finds a shocked Dani and calls her parents home. Dani presses charges against Kane and the case goes to court. Will gives evidence and Kane is found not guilty, which devastates Dani. Will and Dani try to make their relationship work, even after Gypsy reveals she is pregnant with Will's child, but they eventually break up. Dani is later saddened to learn that Will and Gypsy are engaged. Dani becomes good friends with Josh West and they begin a relationship. Dani and Josh start arguing and later break up. While on the beach one day, Dani spots Scott Hunter riding on a white horse and they are immediately attracted to each other. A couple of weeks later, Dani meets Scott again and they go out on a date. They begin a relationship, but it is tested by the arrival of Scott's alcoholic sister, Kit, and Kane's return to the Bay. Dani refuses to accept that Kane is a changed man and she is devastated when she learns that her sister, Kirsty, is dating him. Dani then tries break the couple up and she and Kirsty argue a lot. When Scott suggests that Dani seeks professional help, Dani becomes upset and goes to see her university lecturer, Ross McLuhan. While Ross comforts Dani, they kiss. Dani becomes upset and gets in her car and leaves. On her way home, Dani hits something. She initially thinks it is an animal and leaves the scene. However, she soon learns that she hit Kane. Dani is arrested and later found guilty of attempted murder. She is sent to jail, where she is bullied by inmate, Viv \\"The Guv\\" Standish. Eventually Dani gains The Guv's respect and they become friends, even staying in touch when Dani is released. Dani continues with her mission to break Kane and Kirsty up, but fails. However, when Kane helps to rescue her family from a mine shaft and saves several people from a fire, Dani starts to forgive him and accept his relationship with her sister. When Dani criticises Felix Walters in an article published in the university newspaper, he starts stalking her. Felix also gets his girlfriend, Sarah Lewis, to dress as a police woman and tell Dani that Scott has died. Dani tries to confront Felix at the university, but ends up assaulting the dean by mistake. When Felix is attacked and winds up in hospital, Dani comes under suspicion. Felix later dies and Dani learns from Viv that she ordered the attack on Felix. It is revealed that Felix actually died from a fatal dose of crystal meth given to him by Sarah. Sarah's fragile state of mind causes her to blame Dani and her friends for Felix's death and she starts terrorising them. After shooting Jesse McGregor (Ben Unwin), Sarah is caught and taken to a psychiatric institution. Sarah later escapes the psychiatric institution and return to get revenge for Felix. When Dani and Scott learn of Sarah's escape, they decide to flee to Paris. However, they forget their passports and return to their house to get them. Sarah surprises them and she ties up Dani, before getting Scott to take her to where the others are hiding. Dani manages to catch the attention of her father and the police, who are outside the house and they free her. She drives to the safe house, where her friends are hiding, to stop Sarah. Upon her arrival, Sarah shoots Noah dead, before turning the gun on herself. Scott proposes to Dani and she accepts. When Viv tells Dani that she is dying, she asks her to write her memoirs. Dani agrees, but the gesture causes problems with Scott. He starts to believe that Dani is having an affair with Stafford McRae (Rohan Nichol), a representative from a publishing company. Stafford accompanies Dani to Viv's funeral in the city and comforts her afterwards. He also admits that he is attracted to her and feels that she should not settle down in the Bay with Scott. Dani realises that she and Scott want different things and they break up. Dani then leaves the Bay. In other media In 2003, two DVDs entitled Home and Away: Secrets and the City and Home and Away: Hearts Divided were released. Secrets and the City was hosted by Sursok and the DVD featured three episodes, one that was not shown on television, behind the scenes footage, interviews and tracks from the Home and Away Hits CD. The episodes focused on Dani and Josh's journey to Sydney, where they tried to track down Dani's father. Dani and Josh meet Hayley and Noah who have gone away for a romantic weekend. Hearts Divided was hosted by Bec Hewitt and like Secrets and the City, it featured an episode that was not shown on television, taking viewers \\"beyond the storyline.\\" There was also behind the scenes footage, a music video and a featurette involving Hewitt and Beau Brady. The story focused on the Sutherland family and the return of Dani's attacker Kane Phillips. The following year Home & Away and Pan Macmillan released two books focussing on the period of Dani's trial for nearly killing Kane. Dani on Trial and Prisoner No. 2549971 gave a different insight, from what played out on screen, into the characters and their motivations. Reception For her portrayal of Dani, Sursok won the Most Popular New Female Talent Logie Award in 2001. Three years later, she was nominated for the Most Popular Actress Logie. Linda Barnier of the Newcastle Herald branded Dani \\"unlucky-in-love\\", while The Sydney Morning Herald's Robin Oliver called her \\"a go-getter\\". A writer for the Home and Away: Official collectors edition magazine called Dani's assault at the hands of Kane \\"harrowing\\". They added that the ordeal and her time in prison was something that she never really got over. Andrew Mercado revealed that viewers complained to TV Week about the producers putting \\"poor Dani\\" in prison. Mercado also called the Sutherland family \\"the most tortured lot in the history of the soap.\\" Channel 5 chose the episode in which Sarah returned to the Bay and Dani and Scott tried to flee her as one of their \\"Best Cliffhangers\\".

Looking only at the first lookahead token \\"\`v\`\\", it cannot decide which of both alternatives for \\"\`Stmt\`\\" to choose, since two input continuations are possible. They can be discriminated by peeking at the second lookahead token (yellow background). In formal language theory, an LL grammar is a context-free grammar that can be parsed by an LL parser, which parses the input from Left to right, and constructs a Leftmost derivation of the sentence (hence LL, compared with LR parser that constructs a rightmost derivation). A language that has an LL grammar is known as an LL language. These form subsets of deterministic context-free grammars (DCFGs) and deterministic context-free languages (DCFLs), respectively. One says that a given grammar or language \\"is an LL grammar/language\\" or simply \\"is LL\\" to indicate that it is in this class. LL parsers are table-based parsers, similar to LR parsers. LL grammars can alternatively be characterized as precisely those that can be parsed by a predictive parser ‚Äì a recursive descent parser without backtracking ‚Äì and these can be readily written by hand. This article is about the formal properties of LL grammars; for parsing, see LL parser or recursive descent parser. Formal definition =Finite case= Given a natural number k \\\\geq 0, a context-free grammar G = (V, \\\\Sigma, R, S) is an LL(k) grammar if * for each terminal symbol string w \\\\in \\\\Sigma^* of length up to k symbols, * for each nonterminal symbol A \\\\in V, and * for each terminal symbol string w_1 \\\\in \\\\Sigma^*, there is at most one production rule r \\\\in R such that for some terminal symbol strings w_2, w_3 \\\\in \\\\Sigma^*, * the string w_1 A w_3 can be derived from the start symbol S, * w_2 can be derived from A after first applying rule r, and * the first k symbols of w and of w_2 w_3 agree.. Def.1. The authors do not consider the case k=0. An alternative, but equivalent, formal definition is the following: G = (V, \\\\Sigma, R, S) is an LL(k) grammar if, for arbitrary derivations ; \\\\begin{array}{ccccccc} S & \\\\Rightarrow^L & w_1 A \\\\chi & \\\\Rightarrow & w_1 u \\\\chi & \\\\Rightarrow^* & w_1 w_2 w_3 \\\\\\\\\\\\ S & \\\\Rightarrow^L & w_1 A \\\\chi & \\\\Rightarrow & w_1 \\\\omega \\\\chi & \\\\Rightarrow^* & w_1 w'_2 w'_3, \\\\\\\\\\\\ \\\\end{array} when the first k symbols of w_2 w_3 agree with those of w'_2 w'_3, then u = \\\\omega.where \\"\\\\Rightarrow^L\\" denotes derivability by leftmost derivations, and w_1,w_2,w_3,w'_2,w'_3 \\\\in \\\\Sigma^*, A \\\\in V, and \\\\chi, u, \\\\omega \\\\in (\\\\Sigma \\\\cup V)^* Def. 5.22 Informally, when a parser has derived w_1 A w_3, with A its leftmost nonterminal and w_1 already consumed from the input, then by looking at that w_1 and peeking at the next k symbols w of the current input, the parser can identify with certainty the production rule r for A. When rule identification is possible even without considering the past input w_1, then the grammar is called a strong LL(k) grammar. Def.2 In the formal definition of a strong LL(k) grammar, the universal quantifier for w_1 is omitted, and w_1 is added to the \\"for some\\" quantifier for w_2, w_3. For every LL(k) grammar, a structurally equivalent strong LL(k) grammar can be constructed. Theorem 2 The class of LL(k) languages forms a strictly increasing sequence of sets: LL(0) ‚ää LL(1) ‚ää LL(2) ‚ää ‚Ä¶.: Using \\"+\\" to denote \\"or\\", the string set \\\\\\\\{ a^n(b^k d + b + cc)^n: n \\\\geq 1 \\\\\\\\} has an LL(k+1), but no Œµ-free LL(k) grammar, for each k \\\\geq 1. It is decidable whether a given grammar G is LL(k), but it is not decidable whether an arbitrary grammar is LL(k) for some k. It is also decidable if a given LR(k) grammar is also an LL(m) grammar for some m. Every LL(k) grammar is also an LR(k) grammar. An Œµ-free LL(1) grammar is also an SLR(1) grammar. An LL(1) grammar with symbols that have both empty and non- empty derivations is also an LALR(1) grammar. An LL(1) grammar with symbols that have only the empty derivation may or may not be LALR(1). LL grammars cannot have rules containing left recursion. Lemma 5 Each LL(k) grammar that is Œµ-free can be transformed into an equivalent LL(k) grammar in Greibach normal form (which by definition does not have rules with left recursion). Theorem 4. =Regular case= Let \\\\Sigma be a terminal alphabet. Subset of \\\\Sigma^* is a regular set if it is a regular language over \\\\Sigma. A partition \\\\pi of \\\\Sigma^* is called a regular partition if for every R \\\\in \\\\pi the set R is regular. Let G = (V, \\\\Sigma, R, S) be a context free grammar and let \\\\pi = \\\\\\\\{ R_1, \\\\dotso, R_n \\\\\\\\} be a regular partition of \\\\Sigma^*. We say that G is an LL(\\\\pi) grammar if, for arbitrary derivations ; \\\\begin{array}{ccccccc} S & \\\\Rightarrow^L & w_1 A \\\\chi_1 & \\\\Rightarrow & w_1 u \\\\chi_1 & \\\\Rightarrow^* & w_1 x\\\\\\\\\\\\ S & \\\\Rightarrow^L & w_2 A \\\\chi_2 & \\\\Rightarrow & w_2 \\\\omega \\\\chi_2 & \\\\Rightarrow^* & w_2 y, \\\\\\\\\\\\ \\\\end{array} such that x \\\\equiv y \\\\mod \\\\pi it follows that u=\\\\omega. A grammar G is said to be LL-regular (LLR) if there exists a regular partition of \\\\Sigma^* such that G is LL(\\\\pi). LLR grammars are necessarily not ambiguous and not left-recursive. Every LL(k) grammar is LLR. Every LL(k) grammar is deterministic, but there exists a LLR grammar that is not deterministic. Hence the class of LLR grammars is strictly larger than the union of LL(k) for each k. It is decidable whether, given a regular partition \\\\pi, a given grammar is LL(\\\\pi). It is, however, not decidable whether an arbitrary grammar G is LLR. This is due to the fact that deciding whether a grammar G generates a regular language, which would be necessary to find a regular partition for G, can be reduced to the Post correspondence problem. Every LLR grammar is LR-regular (LRR, the corresponding equivalent for LR(k) grammars), but there exists an LR(1) grammar that is not LLR. Historically, LLR grammars followed the invention of the LRR grammars. Given a regular partition a Moore machine can be constructed to transduce the parsing from right to left, identifying instances of regular productions. Once that has been done, an LL(1) parser is sufficient to handle the transduced input in linear time. Thus, LLR parsers can handle a class of grammars strictly larger than LL(k) parsers while being equally efficient. Despite that the theory of LLR does not have any major applications. One possible and very plausible reason is that while there are generative algorithms for LL(k) and LR(k) parsers, the problem of generating an LLR/LRR parser is undecidable unless one has constructed a regular partition upfront. But even the problem of constructing a suitable regular partition given grammar is undecidable. =Simple deterministic languages= A context-free grammar is called simple deterministic, or just simple, Exercise 9.3 if * it is in Greibach normal form (i.e. each rule has the form Z \\\\rightarrow aY_1 \\\\ldots Y_n, n \\\\geq 0), and * different right hand sides for the same nonterminal Z always start with different terminals a. A set of strings is called a simple deterministic, or just simple, language, if it has a simple deterministic grammar. The class of languages having an Œµ-free LL(1) grammar in Greibach normal form equals the class of simple deterministic languages. This language class includes the regular sets not containing Œµ. Equivalence is decidable for it, while inclusion is not. Applications LL grammars, particularly LL(1) grammars, are of great practical interest, as they are easy to parse, either by LL parsers or by recursive descent parsers, and are designed to be LL(1) for this reason. Languages based on grammars with a high value of k have traditionally been considered to be difficult to parse, although this is less true now given the availability and widespread use of parser generators supporting LL(k) grammars for arbitrary k.

Volunteer cavalry and infantry were recruited in California and sent north to Oregon to replace the Federal troops and keep the peace and protect the populace. Oregon also raised the 1st Oregon Cavalry that was activated in 1862 and served until June 1865. During the Civil War, emigrants to the newfound gold fields in Idaho and Oregon continued to clash with the Paiute, Shoshone and Bannock tribes of Oregon, Idaho and Nevada until relations degenerated into the bloody 1864 - 1868 Snake War. The 1st Oregon Volunteer Infantry Regiment was formed in 1864 and its last company was mustered out of service in July 1867. Both units were used to guard travel routes and Indian reservations, escort emigrant wagon trains, and protect settlers from Indian raiders. Several infantry detachments also accompanied survey parties and built roads in central and southern Oregon.Edwards, Glenn Thomas, Oregon Regiments in the Civil War Years: Duty on the Indian Frontier, unpublished Master of Arts thesis, Department of History, University of Oregon, Eugene, Oregon, June 1960.

It was equal to a quarter of a sulung. A sulung was the amount of land which could be ploughed by 4 ox-pairs (or approximately 2 hides), therefore a yoke was a pair of oxen, representing the amount of land that could be cultivated by an ox pair. A yoke also described the device used to harness two oxen together (see photo).Domesday Book Online, accessed 15 June 2011.Understanding Old World & Medieval era Measurements, accessed 30 June 2011.Glossary of Terms used in the Domesday Book, the Ickham, Littleborne and Wickhambreaux Conservation Society Angles, Saxons, Jutes in Britain year 600 In early Saxon times nearly all the Weald of Kent, the land between the chalk ridges of the North and South Downs, was covered in ancient broadleaf forest but there are indications that much of what is now Penshurst had been cultivated clearings since Roman days. The Romans left no tangible relics although we have a record of their measurement for land in the \\"Yokes\\" of Chested, Vexour, Chafford etc. The yoke is the old Roman jugerum, about 25 ares or 0.625 acres. This word has survived only in Kent. One theory is that the Jutes conquered Kent, whereas the Angles and Saxons (c 450 AD) settled over the remainder of England. In these \\"yokes\\" along the banks of the river Medway crops such as corn would have been cultivated.History of Penshurst, Penshurst Online A joch is a traditional unit of area in German speaking countries, especially in Austria. One joch is the area of a square 40 klafters (about 83 yards) on a side. This comes to 0.5755 hectares or about 1.422 acres. The plural is Joche. Joch is also the word for a yoke in German, so this unit represents an area that could be ploughed in a day by a yoke of oxen. In what is now the Czech Republic this unit was known as the jitro; in Croatia it is the jutro.How Many? A Dictionary of Units of Measurement by Russ Rowlett and the University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill There are references to the yoke or jugum in Kentish medieval records and in the Domesday survey. The rental record of Gillingham dated 1477 reveals that the yoke was a fiscal land division for purposes of rents and services, and had its own privileges. Its size was clearly related to its fertility and position. For example, an Otford rental of c.1425 lists a full yoke on the fertile soil of the valley as 120 acres, a figure to which many of these yokes approximate, but on the poor clay soils on the Downs one yoke is 231 acres. A modern view of Otford across the fields - geograph.org.uk - 1315084.jpg The stability of names of yokes was remarkable: in Otford, almost all the names recorded in 1285 survived to 1447. The fields of yokes were large enclosures, not open fields, and the land within them, although possibly cultivated co- operatively by many tenants, was usually held severally. It appears that the yoke was a compact holding and this is further suggested by early tenancies. In the 1285 Gillingham custumal, it is recorded that 73.6 percent of the tenants possessed a single yoke of land. By 15th century gavelkind tenure gave rise to an accentuated dispersal of settlement in Kent and many holdings were split and became uneconomic. Thus by the 15th century, yokes comprised one or more large fields farmed in many separate parcels. They were fiscal units with certain defined rights and privileges. Most of them still had a central farm, and they had at some time in the past been single land units.

She was the first female Russian writer to make a living solely from literary work. She is a relative of Nobel Prize winner Ivan Bunin. Biography Anna was born in the village of Urusovo in Ryazan Governorate (present day Lipetsk Oblast). Her mother died in childbirth. She was raised by various relatives, and received only a rudimentary education. She began writing around the age of 13. She published her first work in 1799. She moved to Saint Petersburg in 1802 with the help of a small inheritance from her father, where she established her own home and furthered her education by employing tutors. She devoted herself entirely to writing, supporting herself with help from patrons, and profits from the sales of her works. The Russian Imperial Family awarded her pensions in 1809, 1810 and 1813. From 1807 to 1810 she was part of the literary circle of Gavrila Derzhavin and Alexander Shishkov. She had been introduced to Shishkov by her family connections, and he became a mentor to her. In 1811 she was given honorary membership in the Lovers of the Russian Word. Her first work The Inexperienced Muse was published in 1809, followed by a second volume under the same title in 1812. She travelled to Britain in 1815-17 for breast cancer treatment, which was unsuccessful. She published a volume entitled Collected Works in 1819. In 1820 she was made an honorary member of the Free Society of Lovers of Literature, Science, and the Arts. She left Saint Petersburg in 1824 due to continuing illness, and lived with relatives, but retained financial independence. She died in Denisovka, Ryazan Governorate, in 1829, and was buried at Urusovo. Critical reception She used more varied themes and style, and a wider metrical range in her works than earlier female Russian poets. Her work includes original and noteworthy observations on the experiences of women, especially when she focuses on their conflicts with men. Her poetry was popular at the time; she became famous and was satirised by the Colloquium's rivals, including the Arzamas Society. Her works were forgotten to a large extent after her death, due in some measure to the attacks on her and her works by the Arzamas Society and others, limiting her influence on future poets.

The commission is composed of seven commissioners. It is attached to the Department of Social Welfare and Development. History The commission began as the Bureau of Non-Christian Tribes created by the Insular Government during the American Colonial Period of the Philippines. It then became an independent agency called the Commission on National Integration (CNI). In 1972, then President Ferdinand Marcos split CNI into the Southern Philippine Development Authority (SPDA) and the Presidential Assistance on National Minorities (PANAMIN). In 1984, Marcos created the Office of Muslim Affairs and Cultural Communities (OMACC) to assist both Muslim and non-Muslim minorities. In January 1987, then President Corazon Aquino's administration abolished the OMACC and through three Executive Orders created the Office for the Muslim Affairs (OMA), the Office for Northern Cultural Communities (ONCC), and the Office for Southern Cultural Communities (OSCC). In 1997, then Presisdent Fidel Ramos signed Republic Act 8371 or Indigenous Peoples' Rights Act of 1997, which merged the latter two offices, the Office for Northern Cultural Communities and Office for Southern Cultural Communities into current commission. Criticism =2011 Mangyan evictions case= In 2011, the commission's Oriental Mindoro office was criticized after it made a meeting with indigenous Mangyan communities in Mindoro, where the commission was pushing for the removal of the indigenous Mangyans from their ancestral domains for the establishment of a landfill proposed by the local government of Puerto Galera. The Mangyan walked out of the meeting, sparking outrage from the top officers of the commission. The news broke out and the national commission itself dropped all its social media accounts and even its own website, leaving only the websites of some branch offices operational. Since it was criticized by the public, the commission's Oriental Mindoro office has been in a limbo state, with no actual programs being done. The head commissioner continues to govern the commission, along with the provincial officer, despite the status quo, surging to further criticisms. Provincial officer of NCIP Oriental Mindoro Karen Ignacio and Puerto Galera mayor Hubbert Dolor retaliated by using the IPRA Law as defense for the establishment of the landfill against the indigenous Mangyan people. The IPRA Law is the same law that was made to protect the rights of indigenous peoples in 1997. Gaps in the Law Section 56 of the Indigenous Peoples' Rights Act of 1997 or the IPRA Law states that ‚Äúproperty rights within the ancestral domains already existing and/or vested upon effectivity of this Act, shall be recognized and respected.‚Äù This section is problematic as it means that any title before 1997 holds more weight than an ancestral claim. Scholars and pro-indigenous groups have criticized this section as it effectively destroys any ancestral land claim before 1997. Historians have pointed out that most indigenous groups in the Philippines have been in the archipelago prior to Spanish occupation in the 15th century. However, according to Section 56, since there is no proper documentation committed by the indigenous people prior to 1997, an indigenous group cannot claim any land that have been in non-inidgenous possession prior to 1997. This makes multi-national companies and local government units have the power to resist ancestral claims and use the IPRA Law itself to counter indigenous land claims, as testified in an ongoing Mangyan case since 2011, which evicted indigenous Mangyans from a claimed land they have been using for many years. In 2015, it was announced that the indigenous land shall be made into a sanitary landfill by the Puerto Galera local government unit, and that the Mangyans shall be relocated into a site near the landfill itself. All Mangyan-planted coconut trees on the landfill site shall be chopped down by the government and the local government unit shall compensate only 100 pesos (approximately 2 US dollars) each to the Mangyans. =2019 Chico river project case= On May 16, 2019, amid national outrage after the anti-indigenous Chico river dam project was approved by the government, the NCIP called on to stop the project for a moment as they have yet to release a certificate of approval as the area is an indigenous land of their constituents, the Kalinga ethnic people. On May 27, 2019, it was later revealed that the NCIP already released a certificate for the company to continue with the destructive Chico river dam project, mounting to indigenous protests. The locals have stated that the agency (NCIP), which was made to protect the rights of indigenous people, is now serving the greed of multi- national corporations, to the demise of the people that they were intended to serve. On May 28, 2019, the head of the NCIP, Leonor Quintayo, was replaced by Allen Capuyan, after government released a statement which verified that Quintayo was being investigated by the Presidential Anti-Corruption Commission for intensive corruption.

In North America and Europe, the game was published by En Masse Entertainment (2016-2018), Aeria Games (2012-2016), and ijji (2009-2012). It is hosted in the People's Republic of China by Tencent Games, and in Taiwan by Garena.(previously WarTown) In Japan and Korea the game is hosted by NEOWIZ (operator of Pmang). On June 15, 2011, A.V.A became available for download through Steam. The North American and European version of the game was shut down on June 29, 2018. Red Duck, Inc. attempted to self-publish a modified version of the game for these regions called Alliance of Valiant Arms: DOG TAG, launching an unsuccessful open beta on May 2nd, 2019. AVA: Dog Tag was shut down on May 29th, 2019. The servers were also shut down for Taiwanese version on July 30th 2019 and September 25th 2019 for Chinese version. Gameplay Players join either the EU forces or NRF forces and attempt to complete their mission objective or eliminate the opposing team. There are 3 classes available in A.V.A: point man, rifleman, and sniper. A point man enjoys faster movement speed and is generally suited for close range combat, while riflemen are suited for medium ranges, and snipers are well suited for longer ranges with sniper rifles that feature more damage and penetration power. Each class has unique advantages and disadvantages against other classes. Players are able to choose between classes freely and also acquire Class Skills to further enhance unique characteristics of each class. Alliance of Valiant Arms awards players military ranks based on total experience (gained through playing various game modes and completing objectives). Incentives to rank up include the ability to unlock and purchase various armor, equipment, and guns. The main in-game currency is the Euro, which can be used for purchases in the shop, repairing weapons, and to enter Capsule Shop drawings, which are lotteries for rare equipment. Euros are earned from finishing a match, a possible Quick Match reward, a bonus received from buying items with real money. Players can also purchase equipment from the shop using En Masse Points (EMP), which can be bought by the player using real-world money. Some items in the game can only be purchased using EMP. Most items in the shop can be bought for an expendable or permanent duration. Players had a number of options to customize their characters, ranging from selecting different character avatars, equipment (armor, grenades, weapons), and even changing their weapon characteristics (damage, range, accuracy, stability, rate of fire, ammo) through various weapon modifications. The Team Fortress 2 weapon \\"The Black Rose\\" and an AVA melee weapon \\"Holy Mackerel\\" was awarded to players who registered on Steam and completed the Alliance of Valiant Arms achievement 1st One Down by playing their first game. An in-game clan system existed for players to participate in. In lieu of voice chat, players could quickly issue commands and responses to teammates through keyboard shortcuts. Game modes There are currently 10 game modes in the En Masse version of A.V.A: *AI Mission - A group of 4 or 6 players are automatically assigned to the EU to survive and/or complete mission objectives while fighting against AI-Controlled NRF. *Annihilation - Similar to team death-match, players on two opposing teams attempted to reach the score within the allowed time limit. *Cross Steal - Both teams are tasked with retrieving the enemy's launch key and returning it to their own base, while defending their own launch key. * Demolition - EU forces must successfully plant and detonate the bomb, or eliminate the enemy team to win a round. The NRF forces must eliminate the EU team, defuse the bomb, or survive the time limit while preventing a bomb plant in order to win a round. The demolition mode was the only mode played at eSports events (IESF, AIC). * Domination - Both teams compete for domination over a target. The team with higher domination gauge or the one in control of the target when both sides have the same gauge will win. *Escape - EU troops try to escape to a waiting boat (E-boat) or car (E-space) while NRF troops try to stop them. The round ends when the opposing team is wiped out, or when one soldier makes it to the boat. *Escort - The EU forces must escort a tank past enemy lines and repair it if struck down, while the NRF forces will be tasked with damaging the tank with RPGs. * Free For All - Players are pit against each other. The match ends when one player reaches the pre-set score or time runs out in which case the player with the highest score wins. * Infection - Each match will begin with a countdown. During the countdown, players must set up a defensive position or plan a strategy to combat against the zombies. When the countdown is up, one or more players (depending on the total number of players in the match) are transformed into zombies randomly. Human players must survive until the time is up, while the zombies must infect all human players. In the beginning of the match, the host infection player is chosen randomly and after that he or she must attack regular players to convert them into infected players. Afterwards, the Infected ones will move significantly faster than regular players and retain three times the health of the regular ones. Non infected humans will have to collaborate in order to survive or they can choose to die alone in this zombie outbreak. *Lastman Standing - This is a free and open game mode featuring a new map with chaotic game-play. The main objective is to survive until the end, becoming the last survivor. The map will lead to weapons (including melee weapons), gear and eventually vehicles. Also, one can find chests around the map which require a specific key to open.  Game Closure  On January 5th, 2012, ijji, A.V.A.'s publisher in the West, was sold to Aeria Games who continued to operate A.V.A. until 2016. Amid a declining player base, the contract between Red Duck and Aeria Games was not renewed in 2016 in part due to Aeria's refusal to pay for a team to attend AIC 2016, A.V.A.'s major eSports tournament. As a result, A.V.A. migrated to En Masse Entertainment in 2016, who continued to provide service for the game in Western regions until June 29, 2018. In 2018, Red Duck Inc. underwent court-ordered restructuring as a result of insolvency.

Emerson Andrews of the Russell Sage Foundation and author of Foundation Watcher. To achieve its goal of providing broad, open access to foundation information, the Center began in 1959 to establish depositories of information in other libraries ‚Äì now known as the Funding Information Network ‚Äì nationwide. In 1960 it published the first Foundation Directory, which is still being published annually.\\"Russell Sage Foundation.

Today, the organization engages in an increasing amount of global data collection, too. The Center continues to be publisher and distributor of its own directories, research reports, and nonprofit management and fundraising guides, and makes its databases available via Foundation Directory Online, Foundation Maps, and other online resources.  The Funding Information Network  The Funding Information Network (FIN, for short) began just a few years after Foundation Center was founded in 1956, with the establishment of eight regional depositories. According to internal historical documentation, the very first depository was established in 1959 in Chicago, followed in 1962 by locations in Texas and Kansas. By 1978, the Network expanded to 75 ‚Äúcollections‚Äù with at least one collection in all fifty states. Between 1978 and 2013, these ‚ÄúCooperating Collection‚Äù sites evolved from locations which housed collections of Foundation Center directories and databases to locations that engaged their social sector community, providing dynamic support and training on Foundation Center resources. In 2013, Cooperating Collections rebranded as the Funding Information Network, a name more reflective of the responsive network of support and services the program provides.

Merger  In 2012, Foundation Center and GuideStar first officially explored the idea of a merger. On February 5, 2019, Foundation Center merged with GuideStar to form Candid. Both organizations are committed to increasing transparency and providing access to data. The merger brings together large repositories of data on both foundations and nonprofits, with a goal of providing insights and analysis as well. Executive Vice President of Candid and former president of GuideStar Jacob Harold said ‚ÄúOur combined data and networks will allow us to understand the current state of the field in new ways.‚Äù Candid will work to merge datasets to offer insights and more intuitive search results, deliver trainings to help people in the social sector develop skills, create new technology and data skills, help nonprofits improve fundraising skills, drive a common nonprofit profile, and more. Some in the sector see possible downfalls, including data access becoming too expensive and Candid remaining neutral. Part of the costs of the merger were supported financially by donors, including $27 million from the Bill and Melinda Gates, Charles Stewart Mott, and the William and Flora Hewlett Foundation. Much of the money was set to go towards merging business systems, as well as going into a reserve fund and venture fund.

S. Salmon House in southeast Portland in the U.S. state of Oregon, is a 2.5-story apartment house listed on the National Register of Historic Places. Built in the Queen Anne style in 1890, it was added to the register in 1994. The structure, built as a single-family dwelling for W. S. Salmon, was originally located on the northwest corner of Southeast 13th Avenue and Morrison Street. In 1913, architect R. F. Wassell bought the house and had it moved to the west side of Southeast 13th Avenue between Belmont and Yamhill streets, about 1.5 blocks south of its original site. Although the exact date is unknown, at some point after 1900 the house was converted from a single- family dwelling into an apartment house with five units. Significant external features include the asymmetrical shape of the building, projecting bays, a second-floor wrap-around porch, imbricated shingles, and other ornamentation. The five apartments--two on each of the first two floors and one in the attic --feature Queen Anne ornamentation, including recessed alcoves with plaster decorations, a variety of elongated sash windows, tile inserts around a large Rumford fireplace in the largest apartment, carved wooden newel posts, a dogleg staircase with an oval window above the landing, and a pressed tin ceiling in the vestibule. Salmon was the co-owner of the Albina Sash and Door Company, and it is thought that he used the house to attract business during a late 19th-century building boom on Portland's east side. Development in the area was enhanced by completion of the Morrison Bridge over the Willamette River and the subsequent eastward extension of street car lines. One of the new lines ran along Southeast Belmont Street.

David Flying Hawk  =A Horse Named \\"King Tut\\"= David Flying Hawk was the eldest son of Felix Flying Hawk. David was a performer with Wild West shows and traveled with his grandfather Chief Flying Hawk. In 1924, David Flying Hawk performed in Rhode Island and had a notable encounter with a horse named \\"King Tut.\\" \\"King Tut was a big bay, very rank horse, that we bought at Tribune, Kansas. The real King Tut's tomb had been discovered along about this time and papers were still carrying quite a bit of news about it, therefore the name King Tut. The horse had been bucked away from a snubbing horse a few times and we thought he would develop; into a real good, tough bucking horse. A lot of the credit for getting ole Tut started on the road to becoming a great horse must go to a Sioux Indian boy by the name of Dave Flying Hawk, who was on the Knights of Columbus rodeo with us in 1924. This Indian and two others, of the carload that was with us, were bronc riders. Dave was also part of the Indian dance troupe. The program for our opening performance in Providence, Rhode Island was somewhat in turmoil. The Indian dancers had just finished when the arena director, Sammy Garrett, started calling for Flying Hawk to come to the bucking chutes, that his horse was in. King Tut, being pretty wild. Had gone into the chutes first. There being no time for Flying Hawk to change clothes, he came to the chutes in full dance costume‚Äîfringed buckskin clothes, feathers, bells‚Äîthe whole works. While the chute help saddled the big wild King Tut, who hadn't been to town any more than the Indian had, Flying Hawk put on someone's boots and spurs and eased up over the chute and down onto Tut's back. When they opened the chute gate and those bells started ringing and those feathers started flopping, that horse went completely berserk. The kid weathered the storm for about five jumps before he went into orbit. It looked as though someone had shot a wild turkey‚Äîthe crowd went wild. They thought that it was a special act that Flying Hawk was putting on. That was the funniest thong I‚Äôve ever seen happened at a rodeo. We sold King Tut, along with four or five top horses, to McCarty and Elliott of Cheyenne the next year. I heard a few years ago that they bucked him until he was nearly twenty-six years old, but I'm sure that he was never as scared in his life as we was with Flying Hawk on board.\\" Bill King and Wanda Ellis, \\"Those Old King Bucking Horses\\", True West, December 1981. =The Arrest of David Flying Hawk= On March 25, 1927, Chief Flying Hawk wrote Major Israel McCreight for assistance, reporting that David had been arrested and jailed for horse stealing. McCreight well recalled the story of David‚Äôs father, Felix Flying Hawk, jailed in the early 1900s for stealing his own horses, and the injustice visited upon Native Americans. However, despite McCreight‚Äôs considerable efforts, David spent almost a year in county jails. The impact on David‚Äôs family was catastrophic, and without his help, Felix‚Äôs farm failed. Felix wrote McCreight. \\"And they make spoil my family no farm on this year, because my son David was in jail and nobody can not help to work on our farm, and also David's sister, age 20 years, she was dead on May 15, 1927, for I am sorry everythings.\\" McCreight reported that, \\"My investigation shows that he was charged with stealing ponies, two having come into his possession in a trade in which he sold to some horse buyers without having changed the brands. It is only one more of the many examples of persecution of the poor red man by the grafting, cowardly, agency officials. There seems little or no legal remedy for it.\\" David Flying Hawk later became Treaty Chairman of the South Dakota and Seven Camp Fires, pursuing the United States Government for broken treaty obligations.David Flying Hawk (June 5, 1903-April, 1981) Felix Flying Hawk and Major Israel McCreight Felix Flying Hawk wrote letters on behalf of his father Chief Flying Hawk and corresponded with McCreight from 1912 until 1944.

The incident made Kreuz a folkloric figure whose story continues to be told in various media as an iconic (if extreme) example of an airline traveler not reaching his or her intended destination. Original incident (1977) A brewery worker from a village near Augsburg, Bavaria, Kreuz spoke no English and had never experienced international travel except for a day-trip to Switzerland when he boarded a World Airways charter flight from Germany to San Francisco in October 1977. The plane stopped at the Bangor International Airport to refuel and allow passengers to clear American customs and immigration before re- boarding. Because a flight attendant wished him a pleasant visit to San Francisco (she had finished her shift and wouldn't see him again) Kreuz mistakenly believed he had arrived in California , and took a taxi into the city. For four days, he vainly searched for the Golden Gate Bridge and other San Francisco landmarks. The only sight which resonated with his prior image of the California city were the two local Chinese restaurants. He concluded he was in a suburb of the metropolis, and only realized his mistake when a taxi driver somehow communicated to him, in response to his request to be taken to San Francisco, that it was a 3,000 mile journey. He ended up in a German- themed restaurant in nearby Old Town, Maine, whose German-speaking owner, Gertrude Romine, was the first to hear his story and give him a complete picture of where he was. The Romines found him a hotel room in the nearby town of Milford while trying to figure out what to do. His story was picked up by the local press, and soon went national.\\"Golden Gate Bound German Visits Bangor By Mistake\\", Bangor Daily News, Oct. 20, 1977; Ibid, Oct. 25, 1977; Ibid, Oct. 4, 1978; Lewiston Daily Sun, March 19, 1979 Bangor's response and local celebrity The people of Bangor were so touched and amused to be mistaken for San Francisco that over the next 10 days Kreuz was transformed into a local celebrity. He was the guest of honor at an Oktoberfest event sponsored by the Chamber of Commerce, was made an honorary member of the Penobscot Indian Tribe\\"3,000 Mile Error Ends with a Pleasant Visit\\" (UPI) Boca Raton (Fla.)

The magazines Stern and Der SpiegelDer Spiegel, vol. 31, Issues 46-49, p. 84 told his story to the West German public. The people of San Francisco were equally amused, and the San Francisco Examiner paid to fly Kreuz to their city, where he was given an even stronger dose of celebrity treatment.

Kreuz' lingering celebrity cost him his job, however. The West German brewery that employed him attempted to use his news-worthiness for its own purposes, but bristled when Kreuz asked for compensation beyond his laborer's salary. In an interview with the West German press, he made the spontaneous but naive admission that he drank a competitor's brand of beer. His month-long absence to promote an American shopping mall (and during the Oktoberfest season) was likely the final straw, as he was fired from his job of 9 1/2 years when he returned the following month.\\"Future in Bangor Pales: Erwin Kreuz Returns to Germany\\", Bangor Daily News, Mar. 16, 1979 Third trip to Bangor (1979): The limits of celebrity Kreuz returned to Bangor a third and final time in early 1979, now at his own expense and accompanied by little fanfare. Hoping to trade on his celebrity to find a job and emigrate, he was disappointed when his only forthcoming offer was a low-paying janitorial position at the Bangor Mall. Before flying back to West Germany and an uncertain future, he gave an exit interview to the Bangor Daily News in which he said he was not bitter and 'grateful' for the one job offer and the kindness of strangers, but that this third trip to Bangor had been a mistake. He never returned to the U.S. but faithfully paid the yearly tax on his small plot of land in northern Maine, which was still being paid yearly as of 1984.Montreal Gazette, July 4, 1984; \\"Future in Bangor Pales: Erwin Kreuz Returns to Germany\\", Bangor Daily News, Mar. 16, 1979 Kreuz as travel folklore Kreuz' story continued to be told and re-told into the 21st century as not only Maine folklore, but the folklore of modern air travel.

When the two actively engage in a \\"made up\\" situation, it can be called a fauxmance. It is also considered a neologism and its usage is gaining popularity in the media. The term came to the attention of the mainstream on the non-scripted American television show Big Brother when it was first used by Will Kirby in 2001. It has been used in theater on stage for years. Then it moved to films, theater and scripted television,\\\\ It is primarily entered into as a ploy to gain more public and media attention and, in case of television, more camera time during the run of a theater piece, or a television series. It may be also just a publicity stunt. Showmances during reality shows are often motivated by the participants' wanting popularity with the viewers for post show success (as well as success during the show, if Audience Voting is a part of the format). In some competitive reality tv shows (Big Brother or Survivor), contestants often engaged in a showmance for strategic purposes. A showmance couple, by protecting each other and by voting together, maintaining power over the game‚Äôs political power structure. Sometimes, when an amorous relationship actually does continue after the end of a show, many people would still allege that it is \\"just a show\\" the two are putting on. Showmance is a portmanteau of the words show and romance. With a very few exceptions almost all showmance cases end as soon as the theater piece, or the television series or reality show is over. Although mostly involving two persons, it may also possibly extend into a three-way showmance or foursome often accompanied with real or acted rivalries and jealousies. Although mostly the relations involve partners of the opposite sex, at times, showmances may involve same sex relations as well. Often, a showmance occurs between two people playing lovers. The showmance could be caused because of the close contact between the actors in such situations, or because of a confusion between real emotions and the character's emotions. The term has however moved to broader general use, describing any \\"contrived romance\\", also known as a relationship between two people, when either or both \\"act out\\" or fake being in love without meaning it, or in many cases with ulterior motives, like benefiting from the other party or misusing and abusing their feelings.

Originally known as the Lutz Junior Museum, it was developed on March 4, 1953 by a vote of the Manchester Parent Teacher Association (PTA) Council. Their objective was to provide supplemental enrichment to students in their classrooms and asked the community to come forth with ideas. Hazel P. Lutz, the Chairperson of the Art Department in Manchester and also a world traveler, approached the PTA with the suggestion to establish a community youth museum. During her travels, she had collected a variety of artifacts and trinkets that she believed would be of interest to children. Hoping to use these items as educational tools, she established a ‚Äúmuseum‚Äù in the storage closet of her schoolroom. Her collection grew through the donations of others and began to include items that could be related to most academic disciplines. From her storage closet, the PTA offered the museum its first official home in the basement of the Waddell School. By 1957 the rapidly expanding museum possessed hundreds of kits and had a volunteer league of one hundred people. The museum was established as a private non-profit organization 1958. The Board of Education also offered the museum a new home in June of that same year, and the museum was moved to 126 Cedar Street, adjacent to Washington School. The building was originally built by the Cheney family, owners of the nearby mills, in 1859 as a school for their children and children of factory workers. On September 26, 1958 the museum opened its new doors to the public. The museum now had a home that would allow the display of its collection, the exhibit of live animals, and a space to hold year-round classes for children. The museum continued to grow and by 1982, the museum had outgrown its home on Cedar Street and the Town of Manchester had proposed a larger building. The former South School building, situated beside the Charter Oak Reservoir with scenic views of the Manchester Country Club, was proposed as a new location. The museum accepted the larger building and adopted a new name at the same time. The Lutz Junior Museum became the ‚ÄúLutz Children‚Äôs Museum.\\" Education and events The museum offers classes in art, history, and natural sciences taught by its resident teachers. In addition, the Lutz also offers In-School Resource Lessons, during which the museum's educators travel to schools, camps, and other children's programs to deliver lessons similar to the ones held at the museum. \\"They travel with museum artifacts or live animals and sometimes appear in costume.\\"LutzMuseum.org The Lutz Children's museum educators \\"typically have undergraduate degrees in their area of expertise, archaeology or biology for example, plus advanced degrees in education and/or teaching certification.\\" For more information about classes and In-School Resource Lessons, visit http://lutzmuseum.org/programs/classes/. The museum also hosts a number of events each year, including the annual Farm Day held at the Fish Family Farm in Bolton. Art exhibits are held during the school year, where Manchester's eight elementary schools select student artwork to be displayed. The artwork is sent to the museum, where the students are able to view their work on display. Exhibits =Main Street 1943= The Lutz opened up the Main Street 1943 exhibit in the autumn of 2010. Main Street 1943 is an exhibit and play area designed to replicate Main Street in Manchester in the year 1943. There are hometown staples such as Marlow's department store (now closed), the typical Main Street apartment, and nods to World War II such as an old- fashioned radio, newspapers, and other artifacts. This exhibit explores the history and culture of Manchester, as well as the nation and the world during this time period. =Farm Room= One of Lutz Museum's most popular exhibits is the farm room, which houses a farm-related play exhibit, information and displays pertaining to working and living on a farm, and a statue of a cow that can actually be milked. =Animal Room= One of the staples of the museum is the Animal Room, which is home to snakes, chinchillas, turtles, rabbits, various birds, and, most famously, Chuckles the woodchuck, who presides over the museum's annual Groundhog Day celebration. Oak Grove Nature Center In conjunction with the Town of Manchester, the museum operates the Oak Grove Nature Center at 269 Oak Grove Street. Located on the fifty-two acre nature preserve, the museum uses the building for outdoor education programs. The nature center is open for specific programs and events. Hazel Lutz The late Hazel Lutz was a beloved art teacher in the town of Manchester.http://www.manchesterhistory.org/reprints/MH55_HazelLutz.html She travelled often, collecting items along the way that she believed would interest her students. She organized a \\"museum\\" out of these trinkets in the storage closet of her schoolroom. As her collection grew, members of the community began to donate to Hazel Lutz's \\"museum,\\" and soon became a collection of educational tools that could relate to most disciplines. The collection was moved to larger and larger spaces until the Lutz Children's Museum was founded in its current location in 1953. The museum still follows Hazel Lutz's mission of combining artifacts from the community and around the world to spark children's interest in education and culture.

It was caused by the death of the former Labour Member of Parliament, Fred Bellenger. The Labour candidate, Joe Ashton, was a Sheffield city councillor. His Conservative opponent was Jim Lester, a Nottingham businessman. The Liberal party decided against contesting the seat for financial reasons. There was one independent, Tom Lynch of the National Union of Small Shopkeepers, who campaigned for a coalition of all the parties and the end of the fivepenny post. He fell five times short of retaining his deposit (only doubly short since 1985). Early reports suggested a low turnout was likely, due to voter disenchantment with the major parties, and Labour had some reason to fear its supporters staying away. Pit closures were an important issue in a seat with a large mining sector vote. Ashton argued that the Labour government's approach, which included redundancy payments to miners over the age of 55, was better than the approach of the Conservatives when they were in power. The other major issues were reported as taxes, prices, employment and education. Bellenger had had a majority at the last general election of 10,428. The seat would require a swing of 11.6 per cent at a time when opinion polls put the Conservatives 7.5 per cent ahead nationally. Conservatives had lately achieved comparable swings to 11.6% in by-elections in Nelson and Colne and Oldham West as economic conditions made the government very unpopular.

Antibodies and image courtesy of EnCor Biotechnology Inc. Antibody staining for NeuN/Fox-3 in the adult rat cerebellum in green. The Fox-3/NeuN antibody binds to the small cerebellum granule cell neurons, which form a prominent layer. In contrast antibody to the close relative of Fox-3/NeuN, Fox-2, is shown in red. Fox-2 antibody stains Purkinje neurons and Golgi cell which are not recognized by the NeuN/Fox-3 antibody. The Purkinje cells form a layer above the much more abundant granule cells, and an occasional Golgi cell, also positive for Fox-2 but negative for NeuN/Fox-3, can be seen in the granule cell layer. DNA is shown in blue. Antibodies and image courtesy of EnCor Biotechnology Inc. NeuN (Fox-3, Rbfox3, or Hexaribonucleotide Binding Protein-3), a protein which is a homologue to the protein product of a sex-determining gene in Caenorhabditis elegans, is a neuronal nuclear antigen that is commonly used as a biomarker for neurons. History NeuN was first described in 1992 by Mullen et al., who raised a series of monoclonal antibodies to mouse antigens with the original intent of finding mouse species specific immunological markers for use in transplantation experiments. In the event they isolated a hybridoma line which produced a monoclonal antibody called mAb A60, which proved to bind an antigen expressed only in neuronal nuclei and to a lesser extent the cytoplasm of neuronal cells, and which appeared to work on all vertebrates. This antigen was therefore known as NeuN for \\"Neuronal Nuclei\\" though what the A60 antibody was binding to was unknown for the next 17 years. In 2009, Kim et al. used proteomic methods to show that NeuN corresponds to a protein known as Fox-3, also known as Rbfox3, a mammalian homologue of Fox-1, a protein originally identified from genetic studies of the nematode worm C. elegans. Structure Western blotting shows that mAb A60 binds to two bands of apparent molecular weight ~46kDa and ~48kDa on SDS-PAGE. These two bands are generated from a single Fox-3 gene by alternate splicing. There are in fact four protein products from the Fox-3 gene as a result of the presence or absence of two amino acid sequences coded by two exons. The inclusion or absence of 47 amino acids from exon 12 results in the ~46kDa and ~48kDa bands seen on SDS-PAGE gels, while the inclusion or absence of 14 amino acids from exon 15 produces two forms which are too similar in molecular size to be discerned on typical SDS-PAGE gels. Interestingly the protein coded by exon 15 adds a C-terminal PY type nuclear localization sequence, which presumably explains why NeuN/Fox-3 protein can be both nuclear and, in some cell types, also cytoplasmic. All forms are expressed only in neurons so the mAb A60 antibody and other similar antibodies to NeuN/Fox-3 have become very widely used as robust markers of neurons. Uses as a Neuronal Biomarker NeuN antibodies are widely used to label neurons, despite some shortcomings, and a September 2018 Pubmed search using the keyword \\"NeuN\\" produced 3060 hits. A few neuronal cell types are not recognized by NeuN antibodies, such as cerebellar Purkinje cells and Golgi cells, olfactory Mitral cells, retinal photoreceptors and gamma motor neurons. However the vast majority of neurons are strongly NeuN positive, and NeuN immunoreactivity has been widely used to identify neurons in tissue culture and in sections and to measure the neuron/glia ratio in brain regions. NeuN immunoreactivity becomes obvious as neurons mature, typically after they have downregulated expression of Doublecortin, a marker seen in the earliest stages of neuronal development. Feminizing Locus on X Homologue Fox-3 is one of a family of mammalian homologues of the Fox-1 protein, originally discovered in the nematode worm C. elegans as the protein product of a gene involved in sex determination. Fox is, in fact, an acronym of \\"Feminizing locus on X\\". The mammalian genome contains three genes homologous to C. elegans Fox-1, called Fox-1, Fox-2 and Fox-3. The Fox proteins are all about 46kDa in size, and each includes a central, highly conserved ~70 amino acid RRM or RNA recognition motif. RRM domains are one of the most common in the human genome and are found in numerous proteins which bind RNA molecules. NeuN/Fox-3 and the other Fox proteins function in the regulation of mRNA splicing and bind specific RNA sequences. For a review of the Fox family of proteins see this reference. An alternate name for Fox-3 is hexaribonucleotide binding protein 3 since Fox-3, like Fox-2 and Fox-1, bind the hexaribonucleotide UGCAUG, this binding being involved in the regulation of mRNA splicing.

At the height of her fame she was persuaded by the showman P. T. Barnum to undertake a long tour of the United States. The tour began in September 1850 and continued to May 1852. Barnum's advance publicity made Lind a celebrity even before she arrived in the U.S., and tickets for her first concerts were in such demand that Barnum sold them by auction. The tour provoked a popular furore dubbed \\"Lind Mania\\" by the local press, and raised large sums of money for both Lind and Barnum. Lind donated her profits to her favoured charities, principally the endowment of free schools in her native Sweden. Lind's concerts featured a supporting baritone, Giovanni Belletti, and her London colleague Julius Benedict as pianist, arranger and conductor. Lind found Barnum's relentless commercial promotion of her increasingly distasteful, and she terminated her contract with him in 1851 under amicable circumstances, continuing to tour for nearly a year under her own management. Benedict returned to England in 1851, and Lind's friend Otto Goldschmidt joined the tour as her pianist and conductor. She and Goldschmidt married in February 1852. Background Lind was born in 1820 and enrolled at the Swedish Royal Dramatic Theatre's acting school at age ten. In 1838, she gained fame for her performance at the Royal Swedish Opera as Agathe in Der Freisch√ºtz.Lindgren, A. \\"Lind-Goldschmidt, Jenny Maria\\" in Westrin, Th: Nordisk familjebok, Nordisk familjeboks f√∂rlags aktiebolag, 1912, Vol. 16, pp. 614‚Äì17, accessed 16 June 2011 After this, she was in great demand throughout Sweden and the rest of Europe for a decade.Rosen, Carole. \\"Lind, Jenny (1820‚Äì1887)\\", Oxford Dictionary of National Biography, Oxford University Press, 2004, accessed 16 June 2011 By 1849, when Lind was in the middle of her third triumphant London season, the American showman P. T. Barnum had become aware of her success and the large audiences she attracted. He had toured Europe in 1845 and 1846 with his first great attraction, General Tom Thumb. He had never heard Lind sing, and was by his own admission unmusical,Rogers, Francis. \\"Jenny Lind\\", The Musical Quarterly, Vol. 32, No. 3 (July 1946), pp. 437‚Äì448 but he knew that concert halls sold out wherever she performed. Furthermore, he was confident that her reputation for philanthropy could be turned to good use in his publicity. In October 1849, he engaged an Englishman, John Wilton, to locate Lind and make her an offer. Lind wanted to endow free schools in Sweden, and Barnum's offer would allow her to earn a great deal of money.Miller, Philip L. \\"Review: P. T. Barnum Presents Jenny Lind: The American Tour of the Swedish Nightingale\\", American Music, Spring 1983, pp. 78‚Äì80 After checking Barnum's credit with a London bank, on 9 January 1850, Lind accepted his offer of $1,000 a night (plus expenses) for up to 150 concerts in the United States. She insisted on the services of Julius Benedict, a German conductor, composer and pianist with whom she had worked in England, and of the Italian baritone Giovanni Belletti as assisting artist, since solo recitals were still unknown to American audiences. Benedict's fee was $25,000 and Belletti's $12,500. All told, Barnum had committed to $187,500 (approximately $ today) to bring Lind and her musical troupe to America. P. T. Barnum Lind's contract called for the total fee to be deposited in advance with the London banking house of Baring Brothers. Barnum had not anticipated front-end payments for Lind, since he always had paid performers as performances were completed. To raise the money, Barnum sought loans from New York bankers, who refused to make the loans based on a percentage of the Lind tour, so Barnum mortgaged all his commercial and residential properties. Still slightly short, Barnum finally persuaded a Philadelphia minister, who thought that Lind would be a good influence on American morals, to lend him the final $5,000. Barnum sent the $187,500 to London. Lind signed the contract to give 150 concerts in a year or eighteen months, with the option of withdrawing from the tour after sixty or one hundred contracts, paying Barnum $25,000 if she did so. Few Americans had ever heard of Lind, and Barnum's first press release set the tone of the promotion. \\"A visit from such a woman who regards her artistic powers as a gift from Heaven and who helps the afflicted and distressed will be a blessing to America.\\" Her biographical pamphlet and photograph proclaimed: \\"It is her intrinsic worth of heart and delicacy of mind that produces Jenny's vocal potency.\\" Barnum heavily promoted her record of giving frequent benefit concerts for hospitals and orphanages. Before Lind had even left England, Barnum had made her a household name in America. In a statement to the New York Herald, Barnum spoke of the huge sums he had committed, but assured the paper, \\"If I knew I should not raise a farthing profit I would yet ratify the engagement, so anxious I am that the United States should be visited by a lady whose vocal powers have never been approached by any other human being, and whose character is charity, simplicity and goodness personified.\\"\\"The Visit of Jenny Lind to America\\", The Times, 6 March 1850, p. 7 The Atlantic leaving Liverpool for America, August 1850 In August 1850, before Lind left England, sailing from Liverpool on the paddle steamer Atlantic, Barnum arranged for her to give two farewell concerts at the city's Philharmonic Hall. Of her arrival in Liverpool, The Observer wrote that her reception \\"was equal to any ever experienced by the most illustrious or royal visitor. Each day a crowd gathered round her hotel, the Britannia Adelphi, and followed the carriage wherever it went.\\"\\"Jenny Lind at Liverpool\\", The Observer, 25 August 1850, p. 3 The first concert was a performance of Messiah conducted by Benedict, the second a mixed recital with serious and light items. She was, according to an eye-witness, \\"literally 'bombarded' with bouquets. She could scarcely make her way out of the orchestra, there was such a heap of flowers in all possible shapes.\\"\\"Jenny Lind's Departure for America\\", The Illustrated London News, 24 August 1850, pp. 171‚Äì172 On the day of her embarkation she was cheered off by thousands of well-wishers on both banks of the River Mersey, and salutes were fired from the shore. A critic engaged by Barnum to cover the concert wrote of the enthusiasm of the Liverpool public and its grief at Lind's imminent departure. This review was widely circulated in English, European and American newspapers a week before Lind arrived in New York. During the voyage she and Benedict gave two concerts for the passengers and crew of the Atlantic.\\"United States\\", The Manchester Guardian, 18 September 1850, p. 2 In her travelling party, with Benedict and Belletti, were her companion, Miss Alimanzioni, and her secretary, Max Hjortsberg. Arrival in New York City The Atlantic docked in New York on 1 September 1850. The following day, The New York Herald reported on \\"the spectacle of some thirty or forty thousand persons congregated on all the adjacent piers. ... From all quarters, crowds ... could be seen hurrying down towards the Atlantic's dock.\\" So great was people's desire for a glimpse of the star that several people were \\"severely bruised, some came off with bloody noses, and two boys, about twelve years of age, appeared to be seriously injured. Had not the rush been checked in time, many lives would have been lost.\\"Linkon, Sherry Lee. \\"Reading Lind Mania: Print Culture and the Construction of Nineteenth-Century Audiences\\", Book History, Vol. 1 (1998), pp. 94‚Äì106 When she set foot on American soil, Lind kissed her hand to the U.S. flag and exclaimed, \\"There is the beautiful standard of freedom, which is worshipped by the oppressed of all nations.\\" She further endeared herself to the welcoming crowd by stopping Barnum's coachman from clearing a path through the throng with his whip. American caricature of Lind's American tour When she realised how much money Barnum stood to make from the tour, Lind insisted on renegotiating their contract. The new agreement, signed on 3 September 1850, gave her the original $1,000 per concert agreed to, plus the remainder of each concert's profits after Barnum's $5,500 concert management fee was paid. Her interest in increasing her earnings was, it seems, genuinely motivated by her determination to accumulate as much money as possible for her chosen charities, but some commentators were sceptical; one wrote: To which Barnum is depicted as responding: Castle Garden, New York, venue of Lind's first American concerts Such dissenting voices were in a minority. Lind's appeal in America was, as Barnum had calculated, due as much to her simple and virtuous personality and her generosity to good causes as to her singing. Barnum is quoted as saying \\"[I]t is a mistake to say the fame of Jenny Lind rests solely on her ability to sing. She was a woman who would have been adored if she had had the voice of a crow.\\" Lind's first two American performances were given as charity concerts in New York City on 11 and 13 September 1850 at Castle Garden, now better known as Castle Clinton. The seats for the first were sold at auction two days beforehand; 4,476 tickets were sold at a total price of $24,753,\\"United States\\", The Manchester Guardian, 25 September 1850, p. 2; Lind's program for the first concert states that sales would \\"considerably exceed $35,000\\". \\"Introduction\\", Castle Garden program, September 11, 1850 with the theatre \\"packed to its utmost capacity\\".Obituary, The New York Times, 3 November 1887 The program for the concert states that the orchestra accompanying Lind consisted of 60 players.\\"Introduction\\" (verso page), Castle Garden program, September 11, 1850 Lind's numbers that evening were \\"Casta diva\\" from Norma; a duet with baritone, \\"Per piacee alla Signora\\", from \\"Il turco in Italia\\"; a trio for two flutes and voice, to the \\"echo song\\" \\"Dost thou hear?\\", composed for Lind by Meyerbeer, from The Camp of Silesia, sung in English, \\"in which she performed some astonishing vocal feats that bordered on ventriloquism\\", and some Swedish songs.\\"Part II\\", Castle Garden program, September 11, 1850 These were regular items in her tour programs, but on this occasion they were joined by a \\"Greeting to America\\", a song with words by the local poet, Bayard Taylor, set to music by Benedict. After Lind had left the platform, to tumultuous applause, Barnum took the stage and, although she had asked him not to do so, told the audience that she was taking no fee for herself and donating her entire fee of $10,000 to twelve New York charities. A reporter commented, \\"The deafening shouts that followed the ... speech were absolutely indescribable ‚Äì many, even among the male portion of the audience, weeping with emotion.\\"\\"Jenny Lind's Progress in America\\", The Observer, 6 October 1850, p. 3 The blatant commercialism of Barnum's ticket auctions distressed Lind, and for the second concert and thereafter she persuaded him to make a substantial number of tickets available at two dollars for the cheapest seats and one dollar for the promenade. Touring Under the management of Barnum, whose publicity always preceded her and whipped up enthusiasm (he had up to 26 journalists on his payroll), Lind and her company toured first in the eastern United States in her own private railroad car, with concerts in Boston, Philadelphia, Washington, D.C. and Richmond, Virginia.Hambrick, Keith S. \\"P. T. Barnum Presents Jenny Lind ‚Äì The American Tour of the Swedish Nightingale\\", Louisiana History: The Journal of the Louisiana Historical Association, Vol. 22, No. 2 (Spring, 1981), pp. 208‚Äì209 Barnum marketed various Jenny Lind- branded products, including songs, clothes, chairs and pianos. From there they went by ship to Charleston, South Carolina, a short but perilous voyage during which they came close to being sunk by a storm; the ship was at one point reported lost.\\"America\\", The Times, 7 January 1851, p. 5 From Charleston, the company went to Havana, but Lind was less successful there; the local public wanted to see her in opera rather than in concert, and the ticket prices were too high for the general public. From Cuba the party sailed to New Orleans, where Lind was greeted with rapturous enthusiasm.Hambrick, Keith S. \\"The Swedish Nightingale in New Orleans: Jenny Lind's Visit of 1851\\", Louisiana History: The Journal of the Louisiana Historical Association, Vol. 22, No. 4 (Autumn, 1981), pp. 387‚Äì417 The historian Keith Hambrick has published a study of Lind's time in the city, which includes details of the commercial marketing of her image, unauthorised and of no monetary reward to her, such as Jenny Lind shirts, Jenny Lind cravats, Jenny Lind gloves, Jenny Lind pocket handkerchiefs, Jenny Lind coats, Jenny Lind hats, and even Jenny Lind sausages. Tickets for all of her 13 concerts in New Orleans were so much in demand that a charge was made for admission to the auction for tickets.The admission charge to the auction was a dime, and the proceeds were given to local charities. See Hambrick (Autumn 1981) Hambrick quotes details of the programming of some of the concerts: Belletti came on before Lind, and after his own numbers he went offstage and escorted her to the platform. She would sing five or so numbers during the course of the concert: on one occasion in New Orleans these were \\"Come per me sereno\\", from Bellini's La sonnambula; a buffo duet with Belletti (\\"Per piacer alla Signora\\") from Rossini's Il turco in Italia; her trademark trio for voice and two flutes composed for her by Meyerbeer; and to finish the concert, a Swedish song, the \\"Herdsman's Song\\", sung in her native language. At other concerts, Belletti sang \\"Largo al factotum\\" from The Barber of Seville and Lind sang \\"Casta diva\\" from Norma and \\"I know that my Redeemer liveth\\" from Messiah. From New Orleans, the party sailed up river to Natchez, Mississippi, Memphis, Tennessee, and St. Louis, Missouri. After this, they performed at Nashville, Tennessee, where a critic wrote: The last stops in the Barnum tour were Louisville, Kentucky, Cincinnati, Ohio, and Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania, where the crowds were so unruly that Lind was trapped in the concert hall for a short time. Stones were thrown at her carriage and into her dressing room,\\"America\\", The Times, 13 May 1851, p. 5 and Barnum hastily rearranged the tour schedule. After a detour to New York, the company returned to Philadelphia. There, Lind and Barnum parted company on 9 June 1851.\\"America\\", The Times, 23 June 1851, p. 5 The separation was amicable, and they remained on good terms afterwards, but Lind had wearied of Barnum's assertive marketing of her. For the rest of her American tour she was her own impresario. She extended her itinerary to include Canada, giving a concert in Toronto for which tickets sold out within 90 minutes of going on sale.\\"Jenny Lind in Canada\\", The New York Times, 21 October 1851 In July 1851, the 20-year-old American poet Emily Dickinson gave an account of a Lind concert: Otto Goldschmidt, who married Lind in February 1852 At about the same time, Benedict received an offer from London to take over as musical director at Her Majesty's Theatre. He accepted, and to replace him, Lind invited Otto Goldschmidt, whom she had known for many years. He was nine years her junior, but they formed a close attachment and were married quietly in Boston on 5 February 1852, shortly after he had been baptised an Episcopalian out of consideration for Lind's religious views. The tour finally returned to New York in May 1852. The New York Times reported, \\"Madame Goldschmidt's Farewell Concert, last evening, was attended by the largest and finest audience we ever saw assembled in New-York. The vast area of Castle Garden was crowded to its utmost capacity, and thousands thronged the passage ways ‚Äì the covered bridge leading from the Garden to the Battery, and the walks into the street far beyond the outer gates.\\"\\"Jenny Lind's Farewell\\", The New York Times, 25 May 1852 Her best known numbers were joined on this occasion by a new song \\"Farewell to America\\", with words by C.P.

Her principal beneficiaries were free schools in her native Sweden, but she also distributed her U.S. concert earnings to local charities, including $1,000 to help build a church in Chicago, and $1,500 for the \\"mother church\\" of the Lutheran Augustana Synod in Andover, Illinois.Historic Churches of the Augustana Evangelical Lutheran Church Jenny Lind Chapel, Andover, Illinois In September 1850, Lind gave $5,000 (approximately $ today) to her Swedish friend, Poly Von Schneidau, for a new camera for his Chicago studio, later used to create one of the earliest images of Abraham Lincoln.

The Jacksons were arrested in October 2003 and indicted by a grand jury on 8 counts of aggravated assault and 20 counts of endangerment for failing to provide adequate nutrition, medical and dental care, and a clean environment for the four boys, who ranged in age from 10 to 19 as of May 2004.New York Times:BRIEFINGS: CHILD WELFARE; COUPLE CHARGED WITH STARVING BOYS The case came to public attention after a neighbor found the Jacksons' 19-year-old adoptive son, Bruce, rummaging through their garbage cans for food at three o'clock in the morning on October 10, 2003, and called 911. The Collingswood Police Department responded to the call and found Bruce, who weighed approximately at the time and stood only tall; he was disoriented, shoeless, Covered in bruises, cold, and extremely malnourished, and the police believed him to be about seven years old. They then went to the Jackson home, where they found his adoptive brothers, who also appeared malnourished: Michael, age 9 and ; Terrell, age 10 and ; and Tre'Shawn, age 14 and . The adoptive father, Raymond Jackson, 51, died of complications from a stroke on November 14, 2004, before the case went to trial.

They also attended church picnics and the boys sang gospel on stage. The Jacksons blamed the emaciated conditions of the four boys on medical problems. The Jacksons had six adopted children: Bruce; Tre'Shawn, 14; Terrell, 10; Michael, 9; Keziah, 12, and Jacee, 5. They also planned to adopt a 10-year-old foster child, Breanna. They received an annual subsidy of approximately $30,000 to care for their foster and adopted children. Dozens of friends and acquaintances thought that the Jacksons were model parents who adopted troubled children with a host of medical problems ‚Äì children no one else wanted. They believed that it was their duty and that Jesus would guide them. Vanessa Jackson, the adoptive mother, eventually pleaded guilty and was sentenced to seven years in prison.

It was founded to celebrate the organization of the 94th World Congress of Esperanto that was held from 25 July to 1 August 2009 in Bialystok. The Centre was officially opened for the visitors on 21 July 2009. At the beginning The Zamenhof Centre was a branch of The Centre of Culture in Bialystok, but it has been an autonomous cultural unit since January 2011. The Zamenhof Centre offers the visitors a permanent exhibition - Bialystok of Young Zamenhof ‚Äì and various temporary exhibitions, concerts, film projections, and theatre performances. Moreover, the Centre regularly holds panel discussions, lectures, and literary promotions. The Zamenhof Centre organises also numerous educational workshops for children and teenagers and introduces modern social and educational projects, such as Living Library and ‚ÄûDiscover Bialystok‚Äù ‚Äì an outdoor game realised in the urban area of the city.  Description  The building where the Ludwik Zamenhof Centre is situated was included in the Jewish Heritage Trail, which was opened in June 2008 in Bialystok. The Trail was created by a group of University of Bialystok students and doctoral candidates ‚Äì volunteers for the University of Bialystok Foundation. The building is also a part of the Trail of Esperanto and Many Cultures, which was open in June 2009.  Mission and activity  All the Centre‚Äôs undertakings are planned so as to roam the frontier, in a broad sense, between cultures, worldviews, beliefs, nations, and sexes. The frontier is \\"a boiling ground‚Äù, and, at the same time, vitalizing one for art ‚Äì that provides a perfect ground for establishing an open and honest, often difficult, but substantial dialogue. By facilitating the dialogue and allaying the disturbances in inter- human communication we aim to gradually weaken, and in the future to remove the barriers emerging from a natural fear of the other, unknown, and therefore frightening and threatening the integrity of our identity. As education is a significant part of the Centre‚Äôs objectives, the scope of the Centre‚Äôs activity encompasses some classes for children devoted to the person of Ludwik Zamenhof, the Esperanto language, and also to the multiculturalism, history and tradition of Bialystok in a broad sense. Modern methods and teaching aids are applied in order to educate according to the idea of teaching by entertaining.  Permanent exhibition  The permanent exhibition entitled Bialystok of Young Zamenhof is the main tool for promotion of the work and the person of Ludwik Zamenhof. This multimedia exhibition based on listening, video, and photographic materials provides the recipients with an attractive way to explore the past. Not only is it a presentation of historical materials, but also an attempt to recreate the atmosphere of the times when young L. Zamenhof was strolling along the streets. The permanent exhibition is used as a substantial basis for numerous scripts of educational classes for children and teenagers.  Esperanto Library  Esperanto ‚Äì Libraro was opened on May 12, 2010 in the building of the Ludwik Zamenhof Centre as a branch of Lukasz Gornicki‚Äôs Podlaska Library in Bialystok.

History M180 bridge over the River Trent Britain built the world's first iron bridge in around 1780. Wrought iron construction of bridges in the UK was later pioneered by Isambard Kingdom Brunel (Clifton Suspension Bridge and Royal Albert Bridge) and Robert Stephenson, (Newcastle's High Level Bridge). The first use of rolled steel in a steel-framed building in the UK was in a furniture emporium in County Durham in 1900. Steel from the Bessemer process was made in open hearth furnaces. This led to five of the larger steelwork contractors in Manchester forming the Steelwork Society in 1908. Other similar groups formed around the country, such as the London-based British Steelwork Association in 1928, and the Tank and Industrial Plant Association. In 1936 these combined to form the British Constructional Steelwork Association. Steel-framed buildings were introduced into the UK in the 1890s and this was given a significant boost in 1909 by changes to the London Building Act which allowed the full benefits of a steel frame to be utilised in the Capital. One of the first buildings to take advantage of this was Kodak House on Kingsway. In the 1930s an important use of steel construction was the National Grid. In 1931 the Steel Structures Research Committee recommended that there should be codes of practice in the steel construction industry, which led to BS 449. From the 1980s steel frame design was carried out to BS 5950. More recently this has been superseded by the structural Eurocodes. During the Second World War the BCSA was consulted for the many military building projects, notably the Mulberry harbours in 1944. In 1962 it set up the Confederation of Associations of Specialist Engineering Contractors (CASEC) with the HVCA (now BESA) and the ECA. In 1967 it set up a legal advisory service. In the early 1970s it consulted with the Merrison Committee which created BS 5400, after some box girder bridges had collapsed (Cleddau Bridge in June 1970). In the mid-1980s there was a resurgence in the UK steel construction industry with fabricated steel increasing from 700,000 tonnes in 1983 to 1 million tonnes in 1986, to 1.4 million tonnes in 1989. Output dropped to around 800,000 tonnes in the early 1990s but revived to reach 1.2 million tonnes by 1999, and 1.4 million tonnes in 2008. Output then fell by 30% to 2010, from where it has begun to pick up again. Dr David Moore has been the Chief Executive Officer since 2019. The UK constructional steel market is worth around ¬£3 billion per annum. The market share of non-domestic multi-storey buildings built with structural steel frames in the UK has remained consistently around 70% since the mid-2000s. Function BCSA represents the British structural steel fabrication industry - building steelwork contractors and bridge steelwork contractors - to government and other industry bodies. The Steel Construction Certificate Scheme (SCCS) is a wholly owned subsidiary of BCSA. SCCS provides certification services to steelwork contractors and the steel supply chain. BCSA audits its members annually to ensure they are competent to undertake certain types and sizes of project. They comply with CE Marking as required by law and are assessed to PAS91. A directory of BCSA member companies is available here. Location BCSA's main office is situated between Whitehall and the Victoria Embankment on Whitehall Court. It is accessed via Embankment tube station. BCSA also has an office in Doncaster, near to Robin Hood Airport, off junction 3 of the M18. Published information BCSA has produced many technical brochures and books on structural steel. Though its market development arm, Steel for Life, BCSA publishes New Steel Construction magazine 10 times a year. Steel for Life also manages SteelConstruction.info, which is the free encyclopedia for UK steel construction information.

After three years as an apprentice in engineering, Henrici entered Karlsruhe Polytechnium where he came under the influence of Alfred Clebsch who encouraged him in mathematics. He then went to Heidelberg where he studied with Otto Hesse. Henrici attained his Dr. phil. degree on 6 June 1863 at University of Heidelberg. He continued his studies in Berlin with Karl Weierstrass and Leopold Kronecker. He was briefly docent of mathematics and physics at the University of Kiel, but ran into financial difficulties. Henrici moved to London in 1865 where he worked as a private tutor. In 1869 Hesse introduced him to J. J. Sylvester who in turn brought him into contact with Arthur Cayley, William Kingdon Clifford, and Thomas Archer Hirst. It was Hirst that gave him some work at University College London. Henrici also became a professor at Bedford College. When Hirst fell ill, Henrici filled his position at University College. He held the position until 1884, turning to applied mathematics after 1880. From 1882 to 1884 Henrici was President of the London Mathematical Society. In 1884 he moved to Central Technical College where he directed a Laboratory of Mechanics which included calculating machines, planimeters, moment integrators, and a harmonic analyzer.O.

The band split up in 2009, but reformed for a one-off reunion show, opening for Imperial Teen as part of Noise Pop 2012.  History  In its most rudimentary form, 20 Minute Loop was founded innominately by Giles during college, circa 1995, as a home-recording project. He recorded a handful of demos to 8-track tape, but never officially released them. He did, however, have the opportunity to play them live to small audiences acoustically several times, usually with the vocal accompaniment of Kelly Atkins, who would later be the only consistent member in 20 Minute Loop besides Giles. Giles originally toyed with other band names, such as With God on the Dog Team Trail, Pierre Bon Bon, Kill Whitey!, and PSA Flight 182, before finally settling on 20 Minute Loop. The band's name alluded to the duration of cockpit conversation recorded by an airplane's cockpit voice recorder for recovery in the event of a crash or other accident.https://web.archive.org/web/20051027115627/http://www.20minuteloop.com/downloads/20ML_press_kit.pdf The actual band was established by Greg Giles in 1996, and their debut EP, With God On The Dog Team Trail, was released on New Year's Day in 1997. (Apart from Kelly Atkins, the band lineup Giles recruited for the EP featured no members of the final lineup.) With God On The Dog Team Trail featured a lo-fi rendition of Jubilation ‚Äì which was rerecorded for Decline of Day ‚Äì as well as three other songs that were never released in any other form. With God On The Dog Team Trail was released on a small indie label, Trystero Records, which was run by a friend of Giles and has since gone defunct. The band soon parted with Trystero, and struggled along for a while with no means of releasing their music. They had recorded their first, self-titled album, and were already in the process of recording Decline of Day, when Jim Greer of the small, Berkeley-based indie label Fortune Records (not to be confused with the defunct Detroit, Michigan-based label of the same name) approached and offered to sign them. This begun a long-lasting relationship with Fortune Records ‚Äì Greer would go on to release their first 3 albums and a split 7\\" with The Monolith. Their debut album, 20 Minute Loop, was released to mostly positive critical reception, and thanks to positive publicity from local venues and indie distributor Aquarius Records, among others, they gained some recognition from the Bay Area indie scene. The band also played a great many shows in order to receive more publicity. With a label deal and an album to their name, the band quickly released their second album, Decline of Day. This album received much more publicity, with positive reviews from Pitchfork, Allmusic, and CD Universe, et alia; yet the group still remained fairly unknown. The artwork for the album was provided by The Velvet Teen's lead singer Judah Nagler. The band's breakthrough would arrive along with their next album, Yawn + House = Explosion, reviews for which appeared in nearly a dozen printed publications, as well as countless indie blogs. The artwork for Yawn + House = Explosion was of particular interest to many; the outside consisted of two different shots of a prepubescent girl grasping chickens, and the inside pamphlet consisted of the lyrics, many of which were determined using a dictionary game invented by the band, spelled out in such a way that it could be seen how certain words were strung together with the lyrics. This was the only album of 20 Minute Loop's to sell out; it sold a couple thousand copies. The band parted from Fortune Records for unclear reasons to record their fourth album, Famous People Marry Famous People. The album, released in 2008, was arguably the band's most polished and intricate ‚Äì it was recorded at John Vanderslice's renowned Tiny Telephone studio in San Francisco, and featured over a half-dozen extra performers. The album featured highly conceptual songs, with sophisticated underlying themes explained on each song's individual Bandcamp page. The album received slightly less publicity due to the loss of a label, but the band still did very well, receiving positive publicity from many well-known sites, such as PopMatters and KQED, amongst others. The band played a few more shows before announcing a breakup on their Myspace, due to an inability to continue \\"outmaneuvering real-life contingencies\\". They announced that their \\"final show ever\\" would take place on November 15, but, untrue to their word, they reunited for Noise Pop 2012, opening for Imperial Teen. In 2014, Greg Giles and Kelly Atkins reformed 20 Minute Loop with Kevin Seal of Griddle to unearth songs in a new stripped down format, including piano, guitar, viola and trumpet and focusing more on vocal harmonies and lyrical content. Jim Greer of Fortune Records was inspired to record this version of 20 Minute Loop and as of early 2015, the trio is recording a new album in this formation, including additional instrumentalists and vocalists. Release date TBD in 2016 along with a sprinkling of concert appearances.

It tells the story of two students who are driven apart by their class differences, but eventually marry. Plot Ratna, a young student, inadvertently meets Suparta, a medical student, on a train. There, Suparta tries to find her a seat but fails because a Chinese-Indonesian couple are using the spare seats for their luggage. Upon arrival in Cimahi, Suparta escorts Ratna to her school. Pleased by Suparta's manners, Ratna and he agree to keep in contact via mail. A few months later, Suparta proposes to Ratna via post; Ratna accepts, and leaves for Sumedang to meet Suparta's bangsawan parents. However, Suparta's mother, Nyai Raden Tedja Ningrum, is unwilling to accept Ratna as her daughter-in-law because Ratna is not of bangsawan descent. Disappointed, Ratna decides to forget Suparta. Not long afterwards, her father's chalk business becomes bankrupt, and Ratna has to drop out of school and find a job as a salesclerk, then later at a lawyer's office and as a maid for a Dutch couple. However, one of the other maids, Jene, becomes jealous of her and tells the police that Ratna stole jewelry from her mistress. After being arrested, Ratna tries to escape but falls into a river, nearly drowning. She is brought to a hospital. She is treated by Suparta, who has already graduated from medical school and has been looking for Ratna. Hearing her plight, Suparta hires a lawyer for her and she is declared innocent; Jene's boyfriend, Amat, is shown to have stolen the jewelry. After being discharged from the hospital, Ratna is asked to go to rest at the Bidara Cina pavilion. There Suparta treats her and they grow closer. Once Ratna is fully healed, Suparta proposes to her again and they are married the same day. Reception Pertemuan Jodoh is considered the opposite of Muis' earlier work, Salah Asuhan; Pertemuan Jodoh deals with feudalism, while Salah Asuhan dealt with the incompatibilities in Western and Eastern cultures. However, it has also been called a sequel of Salah Asuhan. Mahayana et al considered the use of language \\"convincing\\", with uneducated characters using a mix of Betawi and Malay words. As a result, they consider it a result of Muis' observations while living in Batavia. Bakri Siregar considered Pertemuan Jodoh \\"much weaker\\" than Salah Asuhan.

Job description U.S. Air Force Police are designated under the GS-0083 series. Police Officer or Detective is the established title for nonsupervisory positions in the Police Series, GS-0083. (The detective title is for positions primarily concerned with police investigations involving violations of criminal or other laws.) This series includes positions the primary duties of which are the performance or supervision of law enforcement work in the preservation of the peace; the prevention, detection, and investigation of crimes; the arrest or apprehension of violators; and the provision of assistance to citizens in emergency situations, including the protection of civil rights. The purpose of police work is to assure compliance with federal, state, county, and municipal laws and ordinances, and agency rules and regulations pertaining to law enforcement work. Occupational information The primary mission of police officers in the federal service is to maintain law and order. In carrying out this mission, police officers protect life, property, and the civil rights of individuals. They prevent, detect, and investigate violations of laws, rules, and regulations involving accidents, crimes, and misconduct involving misdemeanors and felonies. They arrest violators, assist in the prosecution of criminals, and serve as a source of assistance to persons in emergency situations. Police services are provided in federal residential areas, parks, reservations, roads and highways, commercial and industrial areas, military installations, federally owned and leased office buildings, and similar facilities under federal control. Within their jurisdictions, police officers enforce a wide variety of federal, state, county, and municipal laws and ordinances, and agency rules and regulations relating to law enforcement. They must be cognizant of the rights of suspects, the laws of search and seizure, constraints on the use of force (including deadly force), and the civil rights of individuals. Police officers are commissioned, deputized, appointed, or otherwise designated as agency and/or local law enforcement officers by statute, delegation, or deputization by local governments, or other official act. Arrest and apprehension authority includes the power to formally detain and incarcerate individuals pending the completion of formal charges (booking); requesting and serving warrants for search, seizure, and arrest; testifying at hearings to establish and collect collateral (bond); and/or participating in trials to determine innocence or guilt. Police officers carry firearms or other weapons authorized for their specific jurisdictions. They wear uniforms and badges, use military style ranks (private, sergeant, lieutenant, etc.), and are commonly required to refamiliarize themselves with authorized weapons periodically and demonstrate skill in their use. Police work in the federal service may involve both line operations and auxiliary operations. Line operations typically include such activities as patrol work, traffic control, canine operations, vice control, work with juveniles, and detective operations. Auxiliary operations performed by officers include such activities as operating control centers and communications networks, court liaison, limited laboratory activities, and other miscellaneous duties that support and enhance line operations. Trained officers might perform in any of the line or auxiliary operations in full-time or part-time assignments. Most police officers are engaged in patrol duties and/or traffic control. In performing patrol duties, they serve as a deterrent to crime and other violations of laws, rules, and regulations. Crime prevention is enhanced by the presence of uniformed officers in an area and by their being continually alert in observing, inspecting, and investigating circumstances or individuals which appear unusual and suspicious. Police officers regulate pedestrian and vehicular traffic; prevent accidents, congestion, and parking problems; give warnings; issue citations for traffic violations; and make arrests if necessary. They conduct preliminary investigations of crimes, investigate accidents, dispose of complaints, recover stolen property, counsel adults and juveniles, and assist persons needing help. Typically, investigations that remain incomplete at the end of an assigned shift are turned over for completion by detectives or criminal investigators. Officers assigned to \\"control desk\\" activities receive and record radio, telephone, and personal messages and instructions involving emergencies, complaints, violations, accidents, and requests for information and assistance. They transmit messages and instructions to officers on patrol and dispatch officers to investigate complaints and assist in emergencies. They interpret rules and regulations and answer general inquiries. They may also explain to violators their rights and the procedures involved in securing bond and legal aid and in contacting family members. They collect collateral, issue receipts, record charges and, as necessary, place offenders under arrest. They also search prisoners and remove weapons and articles which could cause injury or be used in escape attempts. They maintain records and prepare reports covering activities and events occurring over the course of a shift. Officers assigned to detective work, full-time or part-time, conduct investigations of crimes and maintain surveillance over areas with high rates of crime. Investigations involve searching crime scenes for clues, interviewing witnesses, following leads, analyzing and evaluating evidence, locating suspects, and making arrests. In cases involving major crimes (capital crimes, those involving prescribed monetary values, or others that may vary in different jurisdictions), the Federal Bureau of Investigation or other specialized law enforcement agencies may assume jurisdiction and control over the investigation. In these cases, police detectives may perform some investigative work under the direction of assigned criminal investigators. Full-time detectives typically work in civilian clothes, although, depending on the availability of investigative personnel, uniformed officers may also perform investigative duties. Investigations conducted by police detectives are distinguished from those conducted by criminal investigators (GS-1811). Detectives handle cases that occur within a prescribed local jurisdiction, where the violations are clearly within the authority of the local police force. Police investigations are limited by agreements with investigative agencies (FBI, DEA, etc.) which prescribe responsibility according to the seriousness of crimes committed and monetary values involved, are conducted totally within the local jurisdiction, and they are commonly of relatively short duration (e.g., a few days). Criminal investigators, by contrast, tend to handle cases that clearly involve felonies, violate federal law, extend over other federal and civil jurisdictions or involve large monetary values, and extend for periods of weeks, months, or even years. Uniformed officers may perform detective duties on a regular and recurring basis when following up on cases originating during their regularly assigned patrol or response activities. In some police forces and jurisdictions, some uniformed officers may perform many or all of the functions commonly assigned in other jurisdictions to plain clothes detectives. In evaluating police officer positions under this guide, the amount and kind of investigative work performed may influence the selection of appropriate factor levels. Federal police officers enforce a wide range of laws. Federal courts commonly \\"assimilate\\" local laws for application to and enforcement within federal jurisdictions. In many jurisdictions, therefore, officers must be aware of and enforce some combination of federal, state, county, and local laws and ordinances. In addition, some officers are required to be fully cognizant of other bodies of written and unwritten law, such as in the case of Indian reservations where tribal law and custom are often enforced by the federal police force. Some federal police officers are responsible for enforcing state and federal fish and game laws on federal installations. These involve licensing requirements, creel and bag limits, installation rules concerning open and closed hunting areas, protection of nongame species, poaching, control of firearms and other weapons, and related aspects of game law and regulation. Some of these working conditions require the officer to make decisions about placing charges and preparing incident reports according to the jurisdiction and requirements of specific courts. Federal police officers perform their duties within prescribed physical boundaries or jurisdictions which are usually clearly defined by physical limitations such as fence or property lines around installations, city sidewalks, or street lines around federally owned or leased buildings. Within those boundaries, Federal police officers typically have full jurisdictional authority over all violations of law, rule, or regulation (exclusive jurisdiction). In some instances, federal authorities negotiate agreements with local governments to share jurisdiction (concurrent jurisdiction) on federally owned or leased property when such agreements can contribute to more effective enforcement actions. Such agreements often contain provisions for federal officers to extend their enforcement actions beyond the bounds of their normal jurisdictions, as in cases of \\"hot pursuit\\" of felony suspects. Within a single police organization which covers properties over a widely dispersed area (federal reservation combined with federally owned and federally leased property off the reservation), several definitions of jurisdiction may apply for each kind of property.

The story revolves around a nun, Sister Jamison Connelly, who deals with her sordid past and the people around her with her acerbic wit and wisdom. When Sister Jamison agrees to sponsor a gay 19-year-old drug user and hustler in an effort to help him combat his addiction, her own faith is ultimately tested. HIGH explores the universal themes of truth, forgiveness, redemption and human fallibility.http://www.highonbroadway.com Production history High had its world premiere in the summer of 2010 at Hartford's TheaterWorks, where director Rob Ruggiero had been a longtime associate artistic director, as well as author Matthew Lombardo, who was born in Hartford and raised in Wethersfield. The show, which had commercial attachments and Broadway ambitions, then traveled to Cincinnati's Playhouse in the Park, followed by a run at the Repertory Theater of St. Louis. Kathleen Turner and Evan Jonigkeit played Sister Jamison and Cody Randall, while Michael Berresse portrayed Father Michael Delpapp. Reviews were mostly positive in the out-of-town tryouts.http://www.courant.com/entertainment/arts/hc-high- picked-0417-20110417,0,4074632.story High opened in previews on Broadway at the Booth Theatre on March 25, 2011, with an official opening night on April 19, 2011. Turner and Jonigkeit remained in their respective roles, and Stephen Kunken replaced Berresse in the role of Father Michael Delpapp. Despite some critical praise, mainly for Jonigkeit and Turner's performances, it was otherwise critically savaged and, coupled with low advance sales, closed on April 24, 2011, after 28 previews and 8 regular performances (making it the shortest-running production of the 2010-2011 Broadway season). Synopsis Sister Jamison Connelly is an acerbic and profanity-inclined nun and drug counselor with a checkered past of her own. She herself is a former drug user and alcoholic (who often was promiscuous with other men, a habit that resulted tragically in her sister's death). Her employer, Father Michael Delpapp, brings her to the attention of Cody Randall, a gay 19 year old drug user and hustler, in the hopes he can be reformed. In doing so, Sister Jamison is left to prevent Cody from self-destructing with his crystal meth addiction, while confronting her own past. Through various plot twists, it is learned that Father Michael is related to Cody (as an uncle) and that he has been financially enabling him for years, which culminated in a cover-up involving Cody murdering his 14-year-old lover. Though at first resistant, Cody eventually begins to take to Sister Jamison's unconventional approach to religion, but relapses back into drugs and a life of crime, and Sister Jamison, unknowing of how to act, leaves Cody to die in a back alley after praying with him.

Early life  Rana Talia Muhammad Khan was born on 14 December 1884 in a Muslim Naru Rajput family in Patiala, Punjab, British Indian Empire.  Police career  Rana Talia Muhammad Khan joined the Indian Civil Service (commonly known as the Imperial Civil Service (ICS) or British India Civil Service) as Deputy Superintendent of Police. A famous incident in his life, whilst serving as Superintendent of Police, Kohat, became the basis of a story in M. M. Kaye's novel, The Far Pavilions, which was also made into a movie. The incident is narrated in Victoria Schofield's book Afghan Frontier: Feuding and Fighting in Central Asia.Schofield, Victoria, Afghan Frontier: Feuding and Fighting in Central Asia, London: Tauris Parke Paperbacks (2003) Schofield writes: :\\"In February 1923 over forty rifles were stolen from the police station in Kohat. The leader of the gang was Ajab Khan, a known rifle thief and suspected murderer of a British couple three years previously. After careful negotiations and secret meetings on the part of the Superintendent of Police, Rana Talia Muhammad, some rifles were returned. But those remaining with Ajab and his brother Shahzada were not surrendered, so Rana arranged for a raid on Ajab's house. The two brothers were away, but in order to escape the wrath of the British the other men disguised themselves as women; they might have avoided detection but for their large feet which gave them away. The rifles were discovered and to make matters worse, their women jeered at them for having tried to escape the danger by posing as women.

They admitted that their records indicate that a certain Emmanuel Uba was admitted to the institution but never completed the program. Presidential aide While still in the United States Uba assisted in the 1999 Presidential elections in Nigeria. Following the elections he returned to Nigeria and was appointed Special Assistant on Special Duties and Domestic Affairs to President Olusegun Obasanjo. In a September 2003 visit by Obasanjo to the United States, Uba was described as the President's right-hand man, and also the gatekeeper for people who wished to talk to the President. Elected politician In 2007, Uba contested in the PDP primaries for the Anambra State governorship election, and was elected in the 14 April 2007 elections. However, the former governor Peter Obi challenged the election, saying that because the courts had only accepted that Obi had won the April 2003 elections on 15 March 2006, he still had three more years or his four-year term to serve. The courts accepted this argument and on 14 June 2007 nullified Andy Uba's election. In November 2009 it was reported that Uba was planning to run for the delayed Anambra State gubernatorial elections in February 2010 on the Labour Party platform, after the Labour party had invited him to make the move. The party's leadership said they \\"believed that he will deliver on the ideals and objectives of the party\\". Speaking about his decision to switch parties, on 31 December 2009 Uba said \\"Labour is my natural political home\\". In the February 2010 elections, Uba came in third. =2011 Senate election= Uba returned to the PDP and was nominated as PDP candidate for Anambra South Senatorial district in the April 2011 elections. He won with 63,316 votes, ahead of Chukwmaeze Nzeribe of the All Progressives Grand Alliance (APGA) with 43,798 and the incumbent senator Ikechukwu Obiorah of the Accord party with 24,724. Uba's election was challenged by Senator Obiora, the Accord candidate, who claimed that Uba had forged his West African School Certificate (WASC) and had not obtained any of the university degrees that he claimed. The story of allegedly faked degrees dates back to a story written by two investigative reporters and published by The News in December 2006. Reporters claim that both Concordia and California State University said that although Uba enrolled, he did not graduate from either university.

The history of Virginia in the American Revolution begins with the role the Colony of Virginia played in early dissent against the British government and culminates with the defeat of General Cornwallis by the allied forces at the Siege of Yorktown in 1781, an event signaled the effective military end to the conflict. Numerous Virginians played key roles in the Revolution, including George Washington, Patrick Henry, and Thomas Jefferson. Antecedents Williamsburg\\", 2220, showing a satirical view of affairs in the colony of loyalists being intimidated to join the Virginia Association. Revolutionary sentiments first began appearing in Virginia shortly after the French and Indian War ended in 1763. The very same year, the British and Virginian governments clashed in the case of the Parson's Cause. The Virginia legislature had passed the Two-Penny Act to stop clerical salaries from inflating. King George III vetoed the measure, and clergy sued for back salaries. Patrick Henry first came to prominence by arguing in the case against the veto, which he declared tyrannical. The British government had accumulated a great deal of debt through spending on its wars. To help pay off this debt, Parliament passed the Sugar Act in 1764 and the Stamp Act in 1765. The General Assembly opposed the passage of the Sugar Act on the grounds of no taxation without representation. Patrick Henry opposed the Stamp Act in the Burgesses with a famous speech advising George III that \\"Caesar had his Brutus, Charles I his Cromwell...\\" and the king \\"may profit by their example.\\" The legislature passed the \\"Virginia Resolves\\" opposing the tax. Governor Francis Fauquier responded by dismissing the Assembly. Opposition continued after the resolves. The Northampton County court overturned the Stamp Act February 8, 1766. Various political groups including the Sons of Liberty met and issued protests against the act. Most notably, Richard Bland published a pamphlet entitled An Enquiry into the Rights of the British Colonies. This document would set one of the basic political principles of the Revolution by stating that Virginia was a part of the British Empire, not the Kingdom of Great Britain, so it only owed allegiance to the Crown, not Parliament. The Stamp Act was repealed, but additional taxation from the Revenue Act and the 1769 attempt to transport Bostonian rioters to London for trial incited more protest from Virginia. The Assembly met to consider resolutions condemning on the transport of the rioters, but Governor Botetourt, while sympathetic, dissolved the legislature. The Burgesses reconvened in Raleigh Tavern and made an agreement to ban British imports. Britain gave up the attempt to extradite the prisoners and lifted all taxes except the tax on tea in 1770. In 1773, because of a renewed attempt to extradite Americans to Britain, Richard Henry Lee, Thomas Jefferson, Patrick Henry, George Mason, and others created a committee of correspondence to deal with problems with Britain. Unlike other such committees of correspondence, this one was an official part of the legislature. Following the closure of the port in Boston and several other offenses, the Burgesses approved June 1, 1774 as a day of \\"Fasting, Humiliation, and Prayer\\" in a show of solidarity with Massachusetts. The Governor, Lord Dunmore, dismissed the legislature. The first Virginia Convention was held at Raleigh Tavern August 1‚Äì6 to respond to the growing crisis. The convention approved a boycott of British goods, expressed solidarity with Massachusetts, and elected delegates to the Continental Congress where Virginian Peyton Randolph was selected as president of the Congress. War begins Lord Dunmore fleeing to On April 20, 1775, a day after the Battle of Lexington and Concord, Dunmore ordered royal marines to remove the gunpowder from the Williamsburg magazine to a British ship. Patrick Henry led a group of Virginia militia from Hanover in opposition to Dunmore's order. Carter Braxton negotiated a resolution to the Gunpowder Incident by transferring royal funds as payment for the powder. The incident exacerbated Dunmore's declining popularity. He fled the Governor's Palace to the British ship at Yorktown. On November 7, Dunmore issued a proclamation declaring Virginia was in a state of rebellion and that any slave fighting for the British would be freed. By this time, George Washington had been appointed head of the American forces by the Continental Congress and Virginia was under the political leadership of a Committee of Safety formed by the Third Virginia Convention in the governor's absence. On December 9, 1775, Virginia militia moved on the governor's forces at the Battle of Great Bridge. The British had held Fort Murray, which guarded the land route to Norfolk. The British feared the militia, who had no cannon for a siege, would receive reinforcements, so they abandoned the fort and attacked. The militia won the 30-minute battle. Dunmore responded by bombarding Norfolk with his ships on January 1, 1776. After the Battle of Great Bridge, little military conflict took place on Virginia soil for the first part of the American Revolutionary War. Nevertheless, Virginia sent forces to help in the fighting to the North and South, including Daniel Morgan and his company of marksmen who fought in early battles in the north. Charlottesville served as a prison camp for the Convention Army, Hessian and British soldiers captured at Saratoga. Virginia also sent forces to its frontier in the northwest, which then included much of the Ohio Country. George Rogers Clark led forces in this area and captured the fort at Kaskaskia and won the Battle of Vincennes, capturing the royal governor, Henry Hamilton. Clark maintained control of areas south of the Ohio River for most of the war, but was unable to make gains in the Indian- dominated territories north of the river. Independence Encampment of the convention army at Charlotte Ville in Virginia. Etching from 1789. The Fifth Virginia Convention met on May 6, 1776 and declared Virginia a free and independent state on May 15, 1776. The convention instructed its delegates to introduce a resolution for independence at the Continental Congress. Richard Henry Lee introduced the measure on June 7. While the Congress debated, the Virginia Convention adopted George Mason's Bill of Rights (June 12) and a constitution (June 29) which established an independent commonwealth. Congress approved Lee's proposal on July 2 and approved Jefferson's Declaration of Independence on July 4. The constitution of the Fifth Virginia Convention created a system of government for the state that would last for 54 years. The constitution provided for a chief magistrate, a bicameral legislature with both the House of Delegates and the Senate. The legislature elected a governor each year (picking Patrick Henry to be the first) and a council of eight for executive functions. In October, the legislature appointed Jefferson, Edmund Pendleton, and George Wythe to adopt the existing body of Virginia law to the new constitution. War returns to Virginia The British brought the war back to coastal Virginia in May 1779 when Admiral George Collier landed troops at Hampton Roads and used Portsmouth (after destroying the naval yard) as a base of attack. The move was part of an attempted blockade of trade with the West Indies. The British abandoned the plan when reinforcements from General Henry Clinton failed to arrive to support Collier. =Raid of Richmond= Fearing the vulnerability of Williamsburg, then-Governor Thomas Jefferson moved the capital farther inland to Richmond in 1780. That October, the British made another attempt at invading Virginia. British General Alexander Leslie entered the Chesapeake with 2,500 troops and used Portsmouth as a base; however, after the British defeat at the Battle of Kings Mountain, Leslie moved to join General Charles Cornwallis farther south. In December, Benedict Arnold, who had betrayed the Patriot/Continental movement and was afterwards positioned as a General in the British Army, attacked Richmond with a militia of Loyalists as well as Hessian mercenaries and an army of British Regulars. Jefferson fled the capital city and called out militia under Colonel Sampson Mathews to harass Arnold's forces.\\"From Thomas Jefferson to Sampson Mathews, 12 January 1781 Founders Online, National Archives,\\" last modified July 11, 2019, https://founders.archives.gov/documents/Jefferson/01-04-02-0417. [Original source: The Papers of Thomas Jefferson, vol. 4, 1 October 1780 ‚Äì 24 February 1781, ed. Julian P. Boyd. Princeton: Princeton University Press, 1951, p. 343] They burned much of the city before withdrawing to Portsmouth, burning and looting along the James River as they went. =Yorktown Campaign= Arnold moved his base of operations to Portsmouth and was later joined by another 2,000 troops under General William Phillips. Phillips led an expedition that destroyed military and economic targets, against ineffectual militia resistance. The state's defenses, led by General Friedrich Wilhelm, Baron von Steuben, put up resistance in the April 1781 Battle of Blandford, but was forced to retreat. George Washington sent the French General Lafayette to lead the defense of Virginia. Lafayette marched south to Petersburg, preventing Phillips from immediately taking the town. Cornwallis, frustrated in the Carolinas, moved up from North Carolina to join Phillips and Arnold, and began to pursue Lafayette's smaller force. Lafayette only had 3,200 troops to face Cornwallis's 7,200. The outnumbered Lafayette avoided direct confrontation and could do little more than annoy Cornwallis with a series of skirmishes. Lafayette retreated to Fredericksburg, met up with General Anthony Wayne, and then marched into the southwest. Cornwallis dispatched two smaller missions: 500 soldiers under Colonel John Graves Simcoe to take the arsenal at Point of Fork and 250 under Colonel Banastre Tarleton to march on Charlottesville and capture Gov. Jefferson and the legislature. The expedition to Point of Fork forced Steuben to retreat further while Tarleton's mission captured only seven legislators and some officers. Jack Jouett had ridden all night ride to warn Jefferson and the legislators of Tarleton's coming. Cornwallis reunited his army in Elk Hill and marched to the Tidewater region. Lafayette, uniting with von Steuben, now had 5,000 troops and followed Cornwallis. Under orders from General Clinton, Cornwallis moved down the Virginia Peninsula towards the Chesapeake Bay where Clinton planned to extract part of the army for a siege of New York City. Cornwallis passed through Williamsburg and near Jamestown. When Cornwallis appeared to be moving to cross the James River, Lafayette saw a chance to attack Cornwallis during the crossing, and sent 800 troops under General Wayne against what they believed to be Cornwallis' rear guard. Cornwallis had set a trap, and Wayne was very nearly caught by the much larger, 5,000 soldier, main body of Cornwallis' forces at the Battle of Green Spring on July 6, 1781. Wayne ordered a charge against Cornwallis in order to feign greater strength and stop the British advance. Casualties were light with the Americans losing 140 and the British 75, but the ploy allowed the Americans to escape. Surrender of Cornwallis at Yorktown (John Trumbull, 1797) Cornwallis moved his troops across the James to Portsmouth to await Clinton's orders. Clinton decided that a position on the peninsula must be held and that Yorktown would be a valuable naval base. Cornwallis received orders to move his troops to Yorktown and begin construction of fortifications and a naval yard. The Americans had initially expected Cornwallis to move either to New York or the Carolinas and started to make arrangements to move from Virginia. Once they discovered the fortifications at Yorktown, the Americans began to place themselves around the city. Gen. Washington saw the opportunity for a major victory. He moved a portion of his troops, along with Rochambeau's French troops, from New York to Virginia. The plan hinged on French reinforcements of 3,200 troops and a large naval force under the Admiral de Grasse. On September 5, Admiral de Grasse defeated a fleet of the Royal Navy at the Battle of the Virginia Capes. The defeat ensured French dominance of the waters around Yorktown, thereby preventing Cornwallis from receiving troops or supplies and removing the possibility of evacuation. Between October 6 and 17 the American forces laid siege to Yorktown. Outgunned and completely surrounded, Cornwallis decided to surrender. Papers for surrender were officially signed on October 19. As a result of the defeat, the king lost control of Parliament and the new British government offered peace in April 1782. The Treaty of Paris of 1783 officially ended the war.

His family had been settled there for some generations, being a branch of the Barhams of Teston House, Teston, Kent, descended from Robert de Berham, upon whom the estates of his kinsman, Reginald Fitzurse, notorious as one of the murderers of Thomas Becket, devolved upon his flight into Ireland after the murder. Nicholas Barham was called to the bar at Gray's Inn in 1542, became an ‚Äòancient‚Äô of that society 24 May 1552, Lent reader in 1558, and was made serjeant-at-law in 1567, having previously (1562‚Äì3) been returned to parliament as member for Maidstone, of which town he also appears to have been recorder. Treason trials William Dugdale does not place Barham in the list of queen's serjeants until 1573. He is, however, so designated in papers relating to the trial of Thomas Howard, 4th Duke of Norfolk, for high treason in conspiring with Mary, Queen of Scots to depose Elizabeth, in 1571‚Äì2. He was given the conduct of the prosecution. From a letter from Sir Thomas Smith to Lord Burghley it appears that the rack was employed on a witness Banister, one of the duke's agents. When the duke, after the confession of the witness had been read, remarked that ‚ÄòBanister was shrewdly cramped when he told that tale,‚Äô Barham, who had been present at the examination, replied ‚ÄòNo more than you were.‚Äô The trial of the duke took place in Westminster Hall 16 January 1572. In the following February Barham was engaged in prosecuting the duke's secretary, Robert Higford, at the Court of Queen's Bench, on the charge of adhering to and comforting the queen's enemies. Higford was found guilty and, like his master, condemned to death. Death In 1577 Barham was present at the Oxford assizes during the prosecution of a malcontent bookbinder, Rowland Jencks, a Roman Catholic. Jencks had spoken badly of dignities and kept away from church; the university authorities had him arrested and sent to London to undergo examination, and he was returned to Oxford to stand trial. This took place on 4 July, when he was sentenced to lose his ears. There was a sudden outbreak of gaol fever; if the account of Anthony Wood is to be credited, besides Barham and Sir Robert Bell, baron of the exchequer, the high sheriff and his deputy, Sir William Babington, four justices of the peace, three gentlemen, and most of the jury died; and in the course of the next five weeks more than five hundred others. Family Barham was survived by his wife, Mary, daughter of John Holt, of Cheshire, and one son, Arthur. He was the owner of two estates, one of which, known as Bigons or Digons, he had acquired by grant from the crown in 1554, the former proprietor having been implicated in the insurrection of Sir Thomas Wyatt; the other, the manor of Chillington, he purchased about the same time. Both estates were sold by his son Arthur. The Sussex branch of the family was largely concerned in the business of ironfounding, of which during the sixteenth and seventeenth centuries the county was a centre, before it declined there.

Olweny's chosen speciality is medical oncology. Career Charles Olweny served as the director of the Uganda Cancer Institute, from 1972 until 1982. Under his stewardship, the team of Ugandan medical researchers that he led were the first group to demonstrate that liver cancer could be successfully treated with chemotherapy using the drug doxorubicin, which is still the mainstay of treatment for liver cancer today. They were also able to confirm that Burkitt lymphoma could be cured with a high dose of chemotherapy and showed that the same was true for childhood Hodgkin disease. They documented the incidence of endemic Kaposi sarcoma in children and conducted clinical trials on how to treat it. During the same timeframe, Olweny served ‚Äì first as a lecturer, then senior lecturer and later as professor of Medicine ‚Äì in the Faculty of Internal Medicine, at Makerere University School of Medicine, serving as head of department, from 1979 until 1982. While in Australia, during the 1980s, he served as clinical professor at the Department of Medicine & Surgery, University of Adelaide, Adelaide, South Australia. He also served as senior director for Medical Oncology, Cancer Control Programme, Royal Adelaide Hospital. In the 1990s, Dr. Olweny migrated to Winnipeg, Manitoba, Canada, to take up appointment as medical oncologist at St. Boniface General Hospital, in Winnipeg. He also served as coordinator, Section of Hematology & Oncology at CancerCare Manitoba, and as an associate staff at the Health Sciences Centre in Winnipeg. He was appointed to his present position in 2006 and assumed office in September of that year. Professor Charles Olweny has written over 20 books and over 120 professional articles. On 1 January 2015, Professor Olweny retired as the Vice Chancellor of Uganda Martyrs University, handing over to Prof. Dr. John Chrysostom Maviiri, formerly Vice Chancellor of the Catholic University of Eastern Africa in Nairobi.

Barclay entered the army as an ensign in the 38th Regiment on 28 October 1789, and embarked with his regiment for the East Indies, where he signalised himself in most of the actions fought there in 1793. He was so distinguished by his talents and courage that he was promoted to a lieutenancy on 31 May 1793, and to a company on 8 April 1795, and on both occasions out of his turn. Having been taken prisoner by the enemy, he suffered much in captivity, and in the year following his promotion he returned to England. Though entitled to six months' leave, he hastened to rejoin his regiment, then in the West Indies. His distinguished qualities having become known to Lieutenant-general Sir John Moore, he was promoted to a majority in the 52nd on 17 Sept. 1803, and on 29 May 1806 to a lieutenant-colonelcy. In 1808 he accompanied Sir John Moore in the expedition to Sweden, and afterwards to Portugal. He was mentioned in despatches for his distinguished conduct during the Battle of the C√¥a on 24 June 1810. He afterwards commanded a brigade, at the head of which, when charging the French on the heights of Busaco, he received a wound below the left knee. For his conduct at Busaco he was again honourably mentioned in despatches. His wound obliged him to leave the service, and he died from the effects of it on 11 May 1811.

Life and education Barclay was born 4 August 1833 at Croydon. He was the younger son of John Barclay. After passing through a preparatory school at Epping, he went to the Friends' school at Hitchin, conducted by Isaac Brown, afterwards head of the Flounders Institute, Ackworth. His education was finished at Bruce Grove House, Tottenham. He attained a good knowledge of botany and chemistry, was fond of electrical experiments, and had skill as a watercolour artist. He married on 14 July 1857 Sarah Matilda, eldest daughter of Francis Fry, and had nine children, of whom six survived him. He died of a brain aneurysm on 11 November 1876. Business career In 1855, he bought a London manufacturing stationery concern in Bucklersbury, (afterwards in College Street and Maiden Lane), taking into partnership his brother-in-law, J. D. Fry, in 1867. In March 1860 he patented an ‚Äòindelible writing paper‚Äô for the prevention of forgery, the process of manufacturing which he described in a communication to the Society of Arts. Quaker views and historiography Though not ‚Äòrecorded‚Äô as a minister of the Society of Friends (to which body he belonged), he preached in their meetings and missions. A posthumous volume gives thirty-six of his sermons, which were usually written, an uncommon thing with Friends. In 1868 he delivered a lecture on the position of the Society of Friends in relation to the spread of the gospel during the last sixty years. He endorsed the view of Herbert Skeats that the early Society of Friends was the first home mission association, and was anxious to see the body regaining its position as an aggressive Christian church. He was strongly in favour of the public reading of the Bible in Friends' meetings, and thought Richard Claridge's ‚ÄòTreatise of the Holy Scriptures,‚Äô 1724, presented a more correct view of the sentiments of the early Friends than their controversial writings. He was as strongly opposed to the practice of birthright membership, introduced among Friends in 1737. His opinions on these points led to his undertaking a series of investigations which culminated in his work on the internal constitution of the obscurer Commonwealth sects, whose origin, ramifications, and practical tendencies. His presentation of the doctrinal aspects of primitive Quakerism was criticised from the standpoint of another Friend, in an ‚ÄòExamen‚Äô (1878), by Charles Evans, M.D., of Philadelphia.

His relations with the Roman Empire are recorded by Priscus.Toumanoff (1963), p. 363. Around 456 Gubazes tried to negotiate an alliance with the Sassanid Persians in order to break free from Roman hegemony. In response, in 456, the emperor Marcian dispatched a military expedition against the Lazi, calling upon Gubazes to abdicate or to depose his son, who was his co-ruler, \\"as it was against tradition to have two joint rulers\\". Eventually Gubazes abdicated in favor of his son and, in 466, paid a visit to Constantinople, where he had to endure the reprimands of the emperor Leo I, but he was eventually treated with favour and sent back to his homeland, where he seems to have been able to resume his reign. Gubazes' visit to Constantinople is also mentioned in the Life of St. Daniel the Stylite, which reports that Gubazes accompanied Leo to see the renowned monk Daniel, who greatly impressed the Lazic king and even mediated a treaty between the two monarchs.Dawes & Baynes (1948), p. 79. This period coincided with a campaign launched against Lazica by its eastern neighbour, King Vakhtang I of Iberia, which is narrated in the Georgian Chronicles. Vakhtang was then a Sassanid vassal and his activities in Lazica may have been indirect assistance from the Sassanid shah, as previously offered to Gubazes during his break with Rome. Around 468 Gubazes, aided by the Romans, attacked the pro-Persian mountainous region of Suania, which had seceded from Lazic overlordship, but, aside from a couple of fortresses, he failed to retake the territory. His failure may have been due to the interference of the Iberians, since the Georgian Chronicles allude to another, in this case victorious, campaign, undertaken by Vakhtang of Iberia in Lazica around this time.Toumanoff (1963), p. 364.Surguladze (2010), ·Éí·É£·Éë·Éê·Éñ I (Gubaz I).

At least 14 issues were published before the paper went under in mid-1970. History Members of The Family and Lorien communes outside Taos launched the paper in the Lorien Building, a converted warehouse north of town on the Santa Fe Trail. Timothy Miller, in The Sixties Communes: Hippies and Beyond gives the following brief account of the origins: > Seeing a need for services to the hippies who were descending on Taos in > droves, The Family prevailed upon a wealthy local counterculturalist‚Äîone of > the young heirs who played such vital roles in sponsoring communes‚Äîto > underwrite a natural foods general store, a free medical clinic, an > alternative newspaper called the Fountain of Light, and a sort of hippie > switchboard, the Taos Community Information Center. The group also ran an > alternative school. These enterprises never produced much income, however. In addition to the services Miller mentions there were also a bookstore, a mobile security patrol, a small research library, and a shortwave radio network connecting some of the outlying communes without phone service. Along with most of the rest of these facilities Fountain of Light perished when the money ran out in 1970, all of the above-mentioned services having collectively run through a quarter of a million dollars in 2 years.Keltz, Iris.

From Radical Left to Extreme Right: a bibliography of current periodicals of protest, controversy, advocacy, or dissent, volume 2, Campus Publishers, 1976, p. 639-641. A small part of the paper's spirit might be gathered from a 1969 editorial entitled \\"Why Taos\\": > While it may be said we are fleeing the deplorable conditions of > contamination of the urban areas, both physical and spiritual, the real > motivation seems to be a quest for a more natural way of life. Away from the > plastic and putrefying conditions in the cities. We mean to establish for > ourselves new life styles that are basically simple and agrarian. Our > concern is with the real‚Äîreal food grown by ourselves for the most part, > real and useful products produced by heads and hands and hearts, expressions > in art forms that manifest individual energies of human beings rather than > the faceless and soulless work of mechanized existence.

Thus the Abbott-Baynes Scud 1, as it became known as after the appearance of the Scud 2 in 1932, was capable of soaring and was light and cheap, though its minimum sink speed of just under 1 m/s was higher than the 0.8 m/s or better expected of the competition sailplanes. Compared with them, the Scud's light weight and short span, combined with wing-tip and fuselage hand holds, made it easy for four people to carry on the ground. The Scud's wooden cantilever parasol wing had constant chord over about 60% of its span, with some taper outboard particularly on the trailing edge. It was built around two spars, with stress bearing plywood skin forward of the rear spar forming a box spar. Aft, the wing and full span ailerons were fabric covered. On the prototype, all flying surfaces were edged with cord, resulting in a scalloped finish. All three all- moving, wood-framed and fabric-covered tail surfaces were identical and interchangeable, making the rudder appear unusually tall. Each surface, mounted on a short stub tube, had a straight leading edge and was tapered on the trailing edge, which had a central cut-out. The fuselage was also a wooden structure, square in section and built around four ash longerons but unusually orientated with one diagonal vertical. It was plywood skinned throughout, apart from an inevitable break in the upper longeron and in the upper surface skin for the under-wing open cockpit. The wing was mounted by two parallel pairs of thin struts from the mid-fuselage longerons to the two wing spars. The upper longeron loads were carried across the break via the wing structure by two pairs of struts, one well forward and one well aft of the cockpit to the mounting points on the wing spars, together with a near vertical pair just behind the cockpit. A landing skid extending from the nose to below the wing trailing edge was retained by leather straps very close to the lower longeron, with landing forces absorbed by rubber blocks. Contemporary accounts emphasised the ease with which the Scud with its two piece wing and readily removable tail surfaces could be dismantled for transport. Operational history The Scud's first flight was on 11 January 1931 at Totternhoe, piloted by Marcus Manton. By the Summer of 1931 it was in production in the Abbott-Baynes works. Production numbers are uncertain; it is known that a total of 12 Scud 1 and Scud 2 were built here, including Scud 1 BGA 300. Another Scud was built before World War II in the Channel Islands. The Scud 1 in the Brooklands Museum is a replica built by the late Mike Beach. One Scud crashed early in the aircraft's career. On 8 March 1931 Thomas Lander was killed immediately after a first attempt at a winch launching. A Scud 1 was on display at the Gliding Exhibition held at Islington in May 1931. Over the Summer of 1931 Flight recorded several meetings with Scuds in attendance, such as those at Portsmouth and Balsdean. A Scud continued in service in 1934 with the Guernsey glider club.

Occupation appears to have been restricted to a relatively short period during the mid-5th century BCE. Excavation The site was discovered by Erich Schmidt (1897‚Äì1964) in 1931 in a survey of the Damghan region. It was excavated in July 1932. Despite the presence of pottery fragments, excavation failed to find any remains of buildings. Two explanations have been suggested. One, by Schmidt, posits that the site was merely a temporary encampment; the other suggests that the site has been eroded, removing any constructions but leaving the surface pottery and shallow graves. Transitional period The sherds from Shir-e Shian are comparable to sherds found in north-central Iran (late Tepe Sialk II phase) and in southern Turkmenistan (Anau IA phase), dating to the mid-fifth millennium BCE. Thus Shir-e Shian may represent the transitional period between Sialk II and Sialk III periods in north-central Iran, preceding the beginning of Tepe Hissar IA period. And also, it can be seen as transitional between the Cheshmeh-Ali and Hissar IA periods.R. H. Dyson Jr. and C. P.

Newmark analysis does not calculate actual displacement, but rather is an index value that can be used to provide an indication of the structures likelihood of failure during a seismic event. It is also simply called Newmark's analysis or Sliding block method of slope stability analysis. History The method is an extension of the Newmark's direct integration method originally proposed by Nathan M. Newmark in 1943. It was applied to the sliding block problem in a lecture delivered by him in 1965 in the British Geotechnical Association's 5th Rankine Lecture in London and published later in the Association's scientific journal Geotechnique.Newmark, N. M. (1965) Effects of earthquakes on dams and embankments. Geotechnique, 15 (2) 139‚Äì160. The extension owe a great deal to Nicholas Ambraseys whose doctoral thesisAmbraseys, N. N. (1958) The seismic stability of earth dams. PhD Thesis, Imperial College of Science and Technology, University of London. on the seismic stability of earth dams at Imperial College London in 1958 formed the basis of the method. At his Rankine Lecture, Newmark himself acknowledged Ambraseys' contribution to this method through various discussions between the two researchers while the latter was a Visiting Professor at the University of Illinois. Method According to Kramer,Kramer, S. L. (1996) Geotechnical Earthquake Engineering. Prentice Hall, New Jersey. the Newmark method is an improvement over the traditional pseudo-static method which considered the seismic slope failure only at limiting conditions (i.e. when the Factor of Safety, FOS, became equal to 1) and providing information about the collapse state but no information about the induced deformations. The new method points out that when the FOS becomes less than 1 \\"failure\\" does not necessarily occur as the time for which this happens is very short. However, each time the FOS falls below unity, some permanent deformations occur which accumulate whenever FOS < 1\\\\. The method further suggests that a failing mass from the slope may be considered as a block of mass sliding (and therefore sliding block)USGS - Geologic Hazards: Figure 1. Sliding block model used for Newmark analysis on an inclined surface only when the inertial force (acceleration x mass) acting on it, is equal or higher than the force required to cause sliding. Following these assumptions, the method suggests that whenever the acceleration (i.e. the seismic load) is higher than the critical acceleration required to cause collapse, which may be obtained from the traditional pseudo-static method (such as Sarma method Sarma S. K. (1975), Seismic stability of earth dams and embankments. Geotechnique, 25, 743‚Äì761), permanent displacements will occur. The magnitude of these displacements is obtained by integrating twice (acceleration is the second time derivative of displacement) the difference of the applied acceleration and the critical acceleration with respect to time.USGS - Geologic Hazards: Figure 2. Demonstration of the Newmark analysis algorithm Modern alternatives The method is still widely used nowadays in engineering practice to assess the consequences of earthquakes on slopes. In the special case of earth dams, it is used in conjunction with the shear beam method which can provide the acceleration time history at the level of the failure surface. It has been proved to give reasonable results and quite comparable to measured data.Wilson, R.C., & Keefer, D.K. (1983) Dynamic analysis of a slope failure from the 6 August 1979 Coyote Lake, California earthquake. Bulletin of the Seismological Society of America, 73, 863-877.Wilson, R.C., & Keefer, D.K. (1985) Predicting areal limits of earthquake-induced landsliding, in Ziony, J.I., ed., Evaluating Earthquake Hazards in the Los Angeles Region-An Earth-Science Perspective: U.S. Geological Survey Professional Paper 1360, 316-345 However, Newmark's sliding block assumes rigidity ‚Äì perfect plasticity which is not realistic. It also cannot really take account of pore water pressure built-up during cyclic loading which can lead to initiation of liquefaction and different failures than simple distinct slip surfaces. As a result, more rigorous methods have been developed and are used nowadays in order to overcome these shortcomings. Numerical methods such as finite difference and finite element analysis are used which can employ more complicated elasto-plastic constitutive models simulating pre-yield elasticity.

Gsz is responsible for creating, preserving and maintaining the city's park system, sports facilities, urban forests, cemeteries, public swimming pools and playgrounds. Ten farms, nine of which are leased out, several nature schools, the local plant nursery, the Succulent Plant Collection and the Chinagarten are also operated, as well as the Quaianlagen promenades at the Z√ºrichsee lake shore. Scope of activities The department includes five divisions: Operations, Services, Promotion of Nature, Planning/Construction and Maintenance. =Operations= The Operations Division includes the nine municipal farms which are leased out and the agricultural estate \\"Juchhof\\". The \\"Juchhof\\" meets the requirements of the Swiss Ecologic Performance Record (√∂kologischer Leistungsnachweis √ñLN). The city forest, which covers an area of about 3,000 acres, is managed sustainably by the \\"Waldrevier Uetliberg\\" and \\"Waldrevier Nord\\". The municipal plant nursery, which organizes various courses and events on all aspects of ‚ÄòGreen Knowledge,‚Äô belongs to this division too, as well as the lease of roughly 6,000 garden allotments. The subdivision \\"Workshop and Logistics\\", which includes wood working, painting and mechanical workshops, is responsible for material acquisition, the vehicle fleet and repairs. =Services= The Services Division provides commercial supporting benefits. It coordinates the economic processes, especially in Human Resources, Finances, Systems Management (Informatics and Geographic Information Systems GIS) and Legal departments. The Services Division's activities are apparent at the job market, as the results of regular user surveys that generate an impact balance sheet, on annual and financial reports and through quality management. =Promotion of Nature= The Promotion of Nature Division advocates for the preservation and conservation of valuable plant and animal habitats. Its goal is to awaken the joy of nature and to show the value of a manifold city nature to city dwellers. The four municipal gamekeepers ensure the harmonic coexistence of humans and wild animals. The nature schools provide age- appropriate experiences for the schoolchildren of Zurich. A wide range of courses and events foster the understanding of nature. Since 1931, the Succulent Plant Collection has accommodated one of the largest and most important special collections of succulent plants, including roughly 6,500 different species from more than 50 different plant families. =Planning/Construction= Open space planning, open space promotion, monuments preservation and construction projects make up the backbone of this division. It ranges from future planning and concept design of new green and open spaces to the promotion of concrete building projects to the protection and development of valuable parks within the city. In addition, this division is responsible for the construction and maintenance of parks, cemeteries, sport facilities, schools and swimming pools in urban areas that include regional public facilities. =Maintenance= There are roughly 200 employees in this division devoted to the care of parks and facilities, city trees, playgrounds, streams, cemeteries and tombs, sport facilities and fields, as well as swimming pools. This division works with the sustainability principle and advocates for the preservation of biodiversity. The green area of the city is divided into 12 districts, which are managed by Green Space Managers, who are contact people for district residents. History Already at the end of the 18th century, a gardener was employed for the maintenance of the new facility \\"Sihlh√∂lzli\\" and other public facilities.R. von Wyss, A. Senti: Z√ºrichs Parkanlagen und Gr√ºnfl√§chen. In: Z√ºrcher statistische Nachrichten, 1952(1), special edition, 50 p. The beginning of the official municipal garden management dates from 1858 when Casper Hartmanns was named the first city gardener. Before then, urban promenades were maintained by city employees, who were not always qualified as gardeners.Records of the building commission, 1846‚Äì1860. The opening of the so-called Quaianlagen in 1887 as well as the first large incorporation of independent municipalities around the city's downtown area transformed Zurich into Switzerland's first large city. The circumstances transformed the scope of activities of the garden administration immensely. Gottlieb Friedrich Rothpletz took over in 1900, the promenade formerly being the responsibility of the city gardener, and in 1902 was made the head of the new horticulture office. His influence still can be seen through the spirit of German landscape architect and social reformer, Leberecht Migge. Migge drafted a public park that considered the city forest as a local recreational area, in opposition to decorative parks like Belvoirpark.Tanja Hirsig, Johannes Stoffler: Garteninspektor Rothpletz (1864‚Äì1932) und das st√§dtische Gr√ºn in Z√ºrich, eine Spurensuche. In: Topiaria Helvetica 2006, p. 13‚Äì19. At the end of the 1920s, cactus grower Jakob Gasser wanted to sell his collection to the city of Zurich. The venture failed miserably. In 1929, the department store owner, Julius Brann, purchased the collection and gave it to the city as a gift. Botany professor Carl Schr√∂ter convinced the city that to accept the collection. Two years later, present day's Succulent Plant Collection, with the name \\"St√§dtische Kakteensammlung,\\" were brought to its new home at the city's greenhouse in the former plant nursery.F√∂rderverein der Sukkulenten-Sammlung. Website of the \\"F√∂rderverein der Sukkulenten-Sammlung Z√ºrich\\". In 1934, the second incorporation of the city took place which expanded the area of which the garden department was responsible.Gr√ºn Stadt Z√ºrich. Homepage of Gr√ºn Stadt Z√ºrich. From 1940 the city's green spaces were converted into farm fields to provide enough food during World War II and increase the self-sufficiency of the country. In 1941, the new plant nursery was completed in Sackzelg. The people acquired a taste for gardening from the so-called \\"war gardens\\" and starting in 1946 small garden allotment areas were set up. In 1959, Walter Frischknecht advocated for the reuse of G59 - 1st Swiss Horticulture Exhibition lands and for other garden design projects in the garden department. Over the course of his career, he developed other projects, such as the rose facility \\"Muraltengut\\" (1960), the \\"Seeuferweg\\" (1963), the lake promenade \\"Utoquai\\" (1971), the \\"Schanzengraben\\" (1982‚Äì1984) and the \\"Irisgarten\\" (1985).Walter Frischknecht: Gr√ºne Werke f√ºr die Stadt Z√ºrich 1959‚Äì1990. author's edition, 1990. From 1969, the first vineyards were planted below the church in H√∂ngg from the initiative of Heinrich Zweifel. The western part of \\"Chillesteig\\" was cultivated shortly after the eastern part. From the late 1960s to the mid-70s, the lack of manpower led to insufficient maintenance of the green spaces. In 1975 a full- time Human Resources Department, including an administrative secretary, was formed that was responsible for about 400 employees. In 1985, the residents of Zurich defended supported the preservation of green and open spaces through several referendums which led to the Garden Department's creation of a green space concept. In the same year, the Conservation Subdivision was formed, followed by the Garden Monument Preservation Subdivision in 1989. In 1996 the first large restructuring of Gr√ºn Stadt Z√ºrich took place when the Agricultural Subdivision which was originally located in the Health and Economic Subdivision was combined with the Garden Department and placed in the Civil Engineering and Waste Management Department.Annual Reports of Gr√ºn Stadt Z√ºrich, 1946‚Äì1996. The Garden Department was renamed the Garden and Agricultural Department, and Irchelpark, Z√ºrich's widest park was opened. Four years later, Ernst Tschannen was given the task to combine the Garden, Agricultural and Forest Departments. In 2000, the new department, directed by Tschannen, was called \\"Gr√ºn Stadt Z√ºrich\\". From 2001 to 2005, several new parks were created in northern Zurich: the Oerliker Park (2001), the MFO-Park (2002), the Louis-H√§fliger-Park (2003), the Wahlenpark (2005) and the Leutschenpark (2008) which are distinguished by their modern and contemporary design. From 2002 until 2011, the GSZ published Gr√ºnzeit, a quarterly magazine. The first \\"Gr√ºnForum,\\" which is a public event that includes presentations on current topics and podium discussions, took place in 2003 and takes place annually. In 2006, the GSZ published The Green Book of Zurich which describes the department's strategy for the next ten years.The Green Book of Zurich. Cordula Weber et al., Gr√ºn Stadt Z√ºrich , 2006, 155 pages. The first playground which was created with input from the local children was opened in 2007 in the Hardau. In 2008 Gr√ºn Stadt Z√ºrich had the opportunity to temporarily use a fallow field with the objective of promotion of nature, especially for schoolchildren. The Zurich wilderness park is operated as an independent foundation which has been called a nature adventure park since September 2009. In January 2010, Gr√ºn Stadt Z√ºrich took over management of the \\"Chinagarten\\" from the Water Supply Department. In July 2011, Gr√ºn Stadt Z√ºrich, in corporation with the Swiss Landscape Architects Association (Bund Schweizerischer Landschaftsarchitektinnen und Landschaftsarchitekten), will host the 48th International Federation of Landscape Architects World Congress (IFLA). In October 2013 Christine Br√§m took over the post of CEO. Notes References * Anne Hansen, Men Kr√§uchi: Z√ºrichs gr√ºne Inseln: unterwegs in 75 G√§rten und Parks.

His life Robert Kerr was the son of Mark Kerr, 1st Earl of Lothian, who had been given the new title in 1606. He was the eldest son, with three brothers: William, Mark, and James, and sisters. In 1606 he became Master of Requests. When his father, the 1st Earl of Lothian, died in 1609, Robert succeeded him as the 2nd Earl of Lothian. A eulogic poem by William Douglas of Tofts mentioned that the Earl had traveled through most parts of Europe and was a student of mathematics and astrology. Marriage In 1611 he married Lady Annabella Campbell, who was the daughter of Archibald Campbell, 7th Earl of Argyll. They had two daughters, Anne and Johanna. His wife died in 1652. His daughter Anne was married on 9 December 1630 to her kinsman Sir William Kerr of Ancrum, who was created a new Earl of Lothian on October 31, 1631. Robert Kerr and Annabella Campbell also had a daughter named Joanna. Suicide and succession He committed suicide on 6 March, 1624. That Saturday Robert Kerr dismissed his servants from him and went alone to a chamber in Newbattle Abbey, saying he was writing his letters and accounts. After barring the door, he stabbed himself several times and cut his throat. At the time it was rumoured that he was beset by debt or that he had been consulting with magicians and witches. He had married Annabella, the daughter of Archibald Earl of Argyll. As he had no male heirs, he had obtained a charter in 1621 for his lands and titles so that his daughter, Anne Kerr, could succeed him, provided that she married a member of the family of Ker. Anne became Countess of Lothian in her own right. However, Sir Robert Kerr of Ancram was apparently given control of the Earl's possessions by James VI of Scotland in 1625. Subsequently, the Countess, Anne, and Sir Robert's son, Sir William Kerr, married, and Sir William was duly made Earl of Lothian on 26 July 1631.Laing, David, ed., Correspondence of Sir Robert Kerr, first Earl of Ancram, vol. 1, Roxburghe Club (1857), xlvii-li.

In 1955, MacLean's son Hector became president, and in 1959, The National Bank of Lumberton changed its name to Southern National.

In his drawings, paintings and collages he explored questions about political injustice and human rights. Koloane is considered to have been \\"an influential artist and writer of the apartheid years\\" in South Africa.  Life  David Koloane was born on 5 June 1938 in the township of Alexandra, a suburb of Johannesburg in South Africa. Already during high school he started being interested in art and doing art in his leisure time when not working to earn money for the family. From 1974 to 1977 Koloane attended art classes at the Bill Ainslie Studios, which later became the Johannesburg Art Foundation. In 1977, Koloane was one of the founding members of the first black gallery in South Africa, located in Johannesburg. His increasing dedication to art led him to start teaching at a high school in a township, first as a part-time job, later full-time. Also in the following years Koloane was very active and committed: in 1982, he co-curated the Culture and Resistance Arts Festival in Botswana, from 1986 to 1988 he was the curator of the Fuba Art Gallery in Johannesburg and in 1990 he co-ordinated and co-curated the Zabalaza Festivals in London, England. Additionally, Koloane studied at the University of London from 1984 to 1985 and received a diploma in museology. He participated in the 1989 Pachipamwe II Workshop held at Cyrene Mission outside Bulawayo, Zimbabwe alongside such luminaries as Joram Mariga, Bernard Matemera, Bill Ainslie, Voti Thebe, Sokari Douglas Camp and Adam Madebe. Koloane created an artist residency called Bag Factory with collector Robert Loder in an area not strictly black or white during Apartheid segregation in 1991. Artists Sam Nhlengethwa and Kagiso Patrick Mautloa were the first resident artists and it went on to host William Kentridge, Helen Sebidi, Penny Siopis, Wayne Barker, Benon Lutaaya and Deborah Bell among many. David Koloane's works are part of many collections worldwide, including the collections of the Johannesburg Art Gallery, The Contemporary African Art Collection (CAAC) of Jean Pigozzi, the South African National Gallery in Cape Town and the Botswana National Museum.  Work philosophy  Koloane had a wide-ranging work area: as an artist, he always connected his own works to respective social controversies; furthermore, he contributed to various catalogues, curated exhibitions, was part of jury boards several times ‚Äì amongst others in the advisory board of the National Arts Council -, and published many articles both in South Africa and internationally. In 1998, Koloane was honored with a Prince Claus Award for his contribution to the development of art in South Africa. He states about his work: \\"My concern in socio-political matters and contributions to the furtherance of disadvantaged black South African artists during and after the apartheid era is evident. My work can be said to reflect the socio- political landscape of South Africa both past and present. The socio political conditions created by the apartheid system of government have to a large extent transfixed the human condition as the axis around which my work evolves. The human figure has become the icon of creative expression\\".

Its first episode aired on May 31, 2011.IMDB article Premise Pedro (Selton Mello) is a young man, recently married to Clarisse (D√©bora Falabella), whom he sincerely loves. Pedro is a successful publicist with a promising career, and Clarisse happens to be his boss. But apparently that's not enough, for Pedro has an imaginary paramour, Amanda (Luana Piovani), a beautiful and sensuous blonde woman whom of course only he can see. Amanda is an ideal woman, in love with Pedro. As she herself states, she exists only to make him happy. Pedro's coworker and best friend Wilson, a cynical lover yet loyal friend, is, as the series begins, the only one to know Pedro's secret. In the pilot episode, Clarisse, after a crisis, is up to divorce Pedro and discovers his imaginary love. She at first thinks he has gone insane, but realizes that the love he feels for Amanda is the love he should feel for her, and so, in a strange way, that proves he still loves her. She forgives Pedro and is reconciled with him, after he promises \\"to send Amanda away\\". In the end of that episode, though, we discover Amanda has not gone away definitively, and, as the second episode open, we know Pedro lied to Clarisse and Amanda is still there. Clarisse, angry and hurt, after quarreling a lot with Pedro, says she wants equal rights and will have a paramour too. When her idea of getting a lover to arise jealousy in Pedro doesn't work, and he exposes her farce, she suddenly pretends she has an imaginary lover too. Suffering, Pedro offers to send Amanda away, forever this time, if Clarisse stops that. However, the couple's life without Amanda reveals itself to be unhappy, and Clarisse, realizing Amanda was indeed the flame and joy of their relationship (as Pedro once said), makes Pedro want to obtain Amanda's forgiveness. She allows him to call back the image he sent away. Style and influence The series mixes humor, eroticism and love-drama.

Life and times =Early life and career= Rousselot was born in √Årbol Solo, a rural outpost in Tapenag√° Department, Chaco Province, in 1935. He debuted on radio when, at age 18, he stood in for an absent broadcaster on LT5 Radio Chaco. He later worked the news daily El Territorio, and in 1958, relocated to Buenos Aires, where he joined Radio El Mundo. Rousselot hosted a talent show on Radio Rivadavia from 1964. He later became a television anchorman on a Channel 11 evening news program, El Diario Alpargatas; among his milestones at the program included live coverage of the 1969 Apollo 11 Moon landing. He would be appointed spokesman for the Argentine Navy in 1972, and in 1973, for the Minister of Social Welfare and head of the Argentine Anticommunist Alliance, Jos√© L√≥pez Rega. Obtaining a loan from the Ministry, he relocated to Resistencia, capital of his native Chaco Province, and purchased an ailing news daily, Diario Norte, persuading his brother, Ricardo, to join him from Chicago. He also served as director of Public Television from May to August 1975. Following the March 1976 coup, Rousselot was arrested and his newspaper was placed under provincial receivership. Its subsequent purchase by Editorial Chaco in 1978 was alleged in a 1996 lawsuit by Rousselot to have been paid with the El Norte's own profits, and at far below its market value. =Mayor of Mor√≥n= He later relocated to Mar del Plata and, in the early 1980s, to El Palomar, where he became a member of the local Justicialist Party committee. His name recognition, television experience, and marqu√©e smile made Rousselot a natural candidate for mayoral elections in Mor√≥n (which at the time had jurisdiction over El Palomar), and in 1987, he was elected to the post. Rousselot became known as one of the \\"twelve apostles\\" (Peronist figures in politics and labor who supported La Rioja Province Governor Carlos Menem over Buenos Aires Governor Antonio Cafiero for the Justicialist Party presidential nomination in 1988), and unsuccessfully sought the vice presidential nod when Menem was indeed nominated. He emphasized public works as mayor, initiating the construction of new streets and an extension of the sewage system, among other projects. The numerous contracts he signed for these projects became the subject of a corruption investigation by the City Council, however, and the 24-person body (in which Rousselot had but four allies), voted to impeach the mayor on April 19, 1989. Rousselot was appointed Cultural Attach√© at the Embassy in Paraguay. He faulted Cafiero for what he considered political persecution, and was subsequently exonerated on 28 charges related to these contracts. He ran again for Mayor of Mor√≥n in 1991, and was returned to office with 64% of the vote. He was re-elected in 1995, though ultimately the issue of city contracts would again lead to his downfall. Citing irregularities in parking meter and hospital contracts, Mayor Rousselot was again impeached on March 16, 1999, and on March 19, he was arrested at his home in Haedo. He maintained that this resulted from his opposition to Governor Eduardo Duhalde (President Menem's leading rival within Peronism at the time). =Later life= Rousselot was convicted in 2000 of extortion and of allocating us$225,000 for the transfer of a hospital without City Council approval, receiving a suspended sentence. Pursuant to the latter sentence, he was arrested in 2001 at the Ministro Pistarini International Airport on suspicion of attempting to flee the country (a violation of the terms of the sentence). He was barred from holding public office, though never convicted of embezzlement. He later returned to radio broadcasting as a host in Radio Colonia (Colonia del Sacramento, Uruguay). Rousselot developed cancer, and died in Buenos Aires in 2010.

Bring and keep Cape Duamuni on with the second summit (the south-western peak) of Pamanzi S.E. 1/3 S., until Zamburu peak bears West, when run East from the latter until the next marks come on- viz., Point Congo on with the second summit of Pamanzi S.E. 3/4 S.

In rounding Zaudzi spit, do not haul to the southward until the four Nossi Effatsi islands open westward of Mognameri.\\" Entering Zamburu passage with the leading mark on, when between Zamburu and North reef, there is a bank of 7 fathoms' soundings, apparently good anchoring ground.

It is based on the book by Peter B. Kyne. The film was directed by W. S. Van Dyke and was filmed in Tahiti like Van Dyke's two previous south sea adventures The Pagan and White Shadows in the South Seas. The film is a remake of a 1925 silent film of the same name.The American Film Institute Catalogue of Feature Films: 1931-40 by The American Film Institute c. 1993The AFI Catalog of Feature Films:..Never the Twain Shall Meet Plot Dan Pritchard (Leslie Howard) is a partner along with his father (C. Aubrey Smith) in a San Francisco-based shipping company. His socialite fianc√©e Maisie Morrison (Karen Morley) avoids setting a wedding date, much to his frustration. Dan is called to the ship of his father's friend, Captain Larrieau, who informs him he has contracted leprosy. He wants the Pritchards to act as guardians for his daughter Tamea, whose mother was a Polynesian queen. Tamea (Conchita Montenegro) is a barefoot native girl, skimpily dressed, her hair wild and her aspect wilder. Once Pritchard agrees to take care of Tamea and see to it that she marries respectably, her father goes topside and jumps overboard. Over the next few days, Dan cannot help becoming infatuated with Tamea, who constantly throws herself at him. She proceeds to shock Dan with her uninhibited behavior. While attending a party, Dan is put off by his friends' prejudice and his affections transfer from his fianc√©e to Tamea, who then seduces him. Dan's father, afraid that his son is losing control, puts Tamea on the next boat back to the islands. Dan soon follows. The two live together happily at first, although it is evident from the start that Dan feels out of his element in the tropics, with nothing to do but lay about all day and drink in the local bar. Things start to go terribly wrong when Dan realizes that because Tamea has none of the sexual repressions of his Western world, she is a bit too free with one of the barely dressed native boys, Tolongo (Bob Gilbert), and Dan becomes jealous of her attentions towards him. Dan becomes an angry drunk. Fortunately for Dan, Maisie did not give up on him. She follows him to the island, rescuing him from the tropical paradise which has become his nightmare. Although Tamea is sad about Dan's departure, she immediately takes up with her bare-chested native boyfriend to help her forget.

In the spring of 1931, he was filming Never the Twain Shall Meet, A Free Soul with Norma Shearer and Clark Gable, and Five and Ten with Marion Davies‚Äîshooting one movie in the morning and another in the afternoon.Eforgan, Estel. Leslie Howard: The Lost Actor. London: Vallentine Mitchell Publishers, 2010. . This led to Howard's lifelong distaste for film acting, the studio system, contracts and the typical schedules required of a Hollywood actor. He said that a \\"typical 'talkie'...is manufactured on the conveyor-belt system\\" and that the script is \\"handed to the actor anywhere from a few days to a few hours before he reports for work...The cast is not even gathered together to read the script before it goes into production.\\"Howard, Leslie, ed. with Ronald Howard. Trivial Fond Records. London: William Kimber & Co Ltd, 1982. . Also, director W. S. Van Dyke was known as \\"One Take Woody\\" because he brought his films to completion on time and under budget. It was long rumored that Conchita Montenegro, barely 18 years old, and Howard had a brief affair either during filming or shortly thereafter. Spanish author Jos√© Rey Ximena refers to the alleged affair in his book El Vuolo de Ibis [The Flight of the Ibis]/Rey Ximena, Jos√©. El Vuolo de Ibis [The Flight of the Ibis] (Spanish). Madrid: Facta Ediciones SL, 2008. . It is clear that Howard and Montenegro were fond of each other as evidenced by photos taken of the two in Madrid, Spain, in May, 1943, shortly before Howard's death. Rey Ximena's book also discusses the claim by Montenegro that she facilitated a meeting between Howard and Spanish dictator Francisco Franco at the request of Winston Churchill to convince Franco not to enter World War II on the side of the Axis powers. Arthur Freed wrote the theme song, \\"Islands of Love.\\" Reception Although Never the Twain Shall Meet is not considered to be one of Howard's finest films, he did receive a positive review in The New York Times, which stated \\"Mr. Howard comes through with another of his specimens of finished acting, investing his character with humor and personality\\" and that the movie was worth seeing.\\"MOVIE REVIEW THE SCREEN; Charm and Sentiment. The Stool Pigeon. In the South Seas. Smuggling and Blackmail.\\" The New York Times, by By MORDAUNT HALL. Published: June 6, 1931. According to the file in the Motion Picture Association of America Production Code Administration Records (MPAA/PCA) Collection at the AMPAS Library, the film was only approved by the Hays Office because MGM's treatment of the picture was \\"all right from the point of view of miscegenation because the father of the girl is white and he is the only one shown in the picture. The mother was a Polynesian queen and Polynesians are not black.\\"\\"AFI Catalog of Feature Films: Never the Twain Shall Meet\\" Hays official John V. Wilson also stated that \\"it might be dangerous to have the son (Leslie Howard) already married and that it would be better to retain the idea in the original story that he has been engaged to the girl a long time and is just on the point of marrying her...If in the beginning of the picture a great deal of audience sympathy is created for the situation surrounding the son and if in the end of the picture the audience is made to feel with him the fallacy of his action is deserting his former life, the tone of the picture will be kept at a level sufficient to satisfy the standards of the Code.\\" References External links *Never the Twain Shall Meet at IMDb.com * Category:1931 films Category:Films directed by W.

The preserve is the last intact remnant of the former Dominguez Slough, an important vernal marsh and riparian forest with riparian zones that once covered as much as of this area, known as the South Bay region. The preserve has of wetland and of upland.Jones & Stokes Associates, Inc. (1999). A Plan for the Gardena Willows Wetland. March (JSA 99-013). Sacramento, CA. The wetlands have a natural depression where water remains for such a significant time that plants and animals not adapted to water and saturated soils cannot survive. The upland, which remains dry outside of the rainy season, supports plants which thrive with these drier conditions. The slough is a part of the Dominguez Watershed, 96% of which is now covered with concrete and man-made structures. It is believed that the Tongva, the native people of this region, were able to commute by canoe around much of the area.Baldwin, Randy (2010) Gardena Willows Wetland Preserve, documentary. Randy Baldwin of RB Media Werks. Tongva villages were located throughout much of what is now Los Angeles and Orange Counties as well as three southern Channel Islands (San Nicolas, San Clemente, Santa Catalina) as distant as 60 miles from the coast of Los Angeles County.https://www.gabrielenotongva.org/ History In 1918 a drainage canal off the Los Angeles River was the first construction project which ultimately led to the end of the Dominguez Slough. After the completion of this canal, during the next fifty years the slough was filled for various construction projects of the growing megalopolis of Los Angeles County. The Dominguez Channel was built in the 1920s to replace natural drainage provided by the slough; today the Channel drains about 62% of the area of the former Dominguez Watershed, focusing water into the Los Angeles Harbor.Map of Dominguez Channel: http://dpw.lacounty.gov/wmd/watershed/dc/DCMP/docs/Dominguez%20Front.pdf In the 1970s, two young Gardena residents became concerned about the mass destruction of willow trees they had witnessed during their short life-times. They sought a way to protect the remaining willows and ultimately contacted the United States Army Corps of Engineers. The Corps recognized the area as a waterway under their jurisdiction and provided federal protection against further destruction of the wetland and the upland immediately surrounding it. Today, 8 of the preserve‚Äôs wetland acres remain under jurisdiction of the Corps while all 9.4 of the wetland acres are under California Department of Fish and Game jurisdiction. The hydrology, soils and native vegetation of the preserve determine these jurisdictional markers. The preserve was federally protected from exploitation by environmental laws of the 1960s and 1970s specific to the protection of wetlands. These environmental laws, such as the Clean Water Act, enacted in 1948 and substantially revised in 1972,http://www2.epa.gov/laws-regulations/summary-clean-water-act reflected growing awareness of the unique ecology and environmental significance of wetlands.  Ecology  The preserve, a remnant wetland of a once-great watershed, is now surrounded by urban development. Two major boulevards and a large strip mall define its eastern and southern boundaries, while a large residential area, two senior housing complexes, and a city park hug its northern and western boundaries. Today the Dominguez Watershed is a complex system of storm drains and flood control channels. The preserve‚Äôs wetlands are now fed by these storm drains, as well as by urban runoff and rain. It is possible that urban runoff, from activities such as excessive landscape irrigation and car washing, now brings water into the preserve in greater quantities and with greater regularity than occurred naturally. These factors may be favoring the growth of the \\"willow dominated riparian forest\\" (p I-8) and moving the preserve away from being a vernal marsh. Conversely, with this high density of urban land use, storm drains and urban runoff entering the preserve bring in nutrient-rich water, perfect for aquatic invasive species, such as water primrose (Ludwigia), a management challenge. If allowed to continue to invade the preserve, water primrose will soak up the water in the wetland and ultimately destroy the willows. Storm drains, boulevards and parking lots also bring in trash, which volunteers regularly clear out. In return, the native plants and soil of the preserve clean the water before sending it on to the Dominguez Channel which feeds to the Los Angeles Harbor and the Pacific Ocean. The preserve's host three vegetative communities: willow riparian forest, freshwater emergent marsh and transition zone. Three species of willows are native to the preserve: Goodding's black willow (Salix gooddingii), which provides important canopy habitat, as well as arroyo willow (Salix lasiolepis) and narrow leaf willow (Salix exigua). On the , coastal prairie and scrublands are the native communities. With this much-needed native vegetation, the preserve provides valuable habitat for various native insects, amphibians such as Pacific tree frogs, and reptiles such as alligator lizards. It also provides a beacon for birds. Each year, volunteers conduct the Audubon Christmas Bird Count at the Preserve, averaging around 30 species of birds. While bird counts remain strong, any birds nesting or feeding at or near ground level at the Preserve risk nest predation or being killed by raccoons, nonnative squirrels, and semi-feral cats. These predatory ground mammals may also reduce populations of amphibians and reptiles. However, in recent years, the threat from feral cats has been decreased significantly, apparently by the appearance of coyotes at the Preserve.  Visitor experience  Today, human activity in the preserve is focused on the upland area which surrounds the wetland. The upland includes the Perimeter Trail, about mile () long, from which the public can view the upland, wetlands and wildlife. From the Trail, the public can access the Overlook Deck and ZigZag Bridge, both of which afford closer views, without disturbing wetlands and wildlife. This basic infrastructure was built around 2001. Since the 1970s the preserve has been federally protected under the jurisdiction of the U. S. Army Corps of Engineers. From then until 2006, occasional volunteer work days were organized at the preserve. However, dedicated management of the preserve did not begin until 2007, with the formation of the non-profit corporation, Friends of Gardena Willows Wetland Preserve, Inc., a 501(c)(3) California tax-exempt nonprofit corporation. There are nine all-volunteer members of the board of directors as of July, 2019. The preserve has no fixed revenue stream, so there are no staff members. As a result, the preserve is closed to the public except for three monthly events. The first event is the Second Sunday Stroll. On the Second Sunday of every month, Board members open the preserve for the public from 1:00 ‚Äì 4:00 pm. The Board sponsors a variety of activities on the Sunday Strolls to attract both children and adults into the preserve. The second monthly event is Third Saturday Restoration, held from 8:00 ‚Äì 11:00 am. For this event, Board members work with volunteers of all ages on removing invasive non-native species and tending newly planted natives. The Board has had great success at management of some invasive species. For example, a team of students from nearby California State University, Dominguez Hills was trained to manage fennel (Foeniculum vulgare) and castor bean (Ricinus communis), two formerly very invasive plants at the Preserve, beginning in 2009. Within 2 years, all old stands of both fennel and castor bean had been cut to the ground. Since then, volunteers monitor the Preserve, and any individuals of these two species that appear are swiftly removed. Work continues on the remaining invasive species, focusing on one species at a time, with some success. For example, mustard (Brassica sp.) is now virtually unknown within the Preserve, while it presents a major challenge at other restoration sites. Wild radish (Raphanus raphanistrum) and Madeira vine (Anredera cordifolia) are greatly reduced from previous levels, but some plants, such as cheeseweed (Malva parviflora) and English Ivy (Hedera helix) are far from contained. The third monthly event is the Fourth Saturday Stroll, when the Preserve is open from 9:00 am to noon. Members of the public are welcome to simply walk through the Preserve or take one of the themed self- guided tours. All of these regularly scheduled events are offered free of charge, though donations are welcome. They are held with the stated goal of educating the public on the importance of the Preserve, how it fits into the larger environmental picture and how each person can contribute to the viability and health of this wetland preserve, a vestige of a once-great watershed.

The group was on the roster of Big Weekend Records, Bullimore's record label. The Beatbullyz street team was known as \\"The Minotaurs\\". A review in the British newspaper, The Guardian, stated that the group held the potential to be \\"the UK answer to Black Eyed Peas.\\" Endorsements for the Beatbullyz were also given by BBC Radio 1 DJs Scott Mills, Fearne Cotton, Huw Stephens and Greg James.

What ever happened to his mask? Formation Beatbullyz formed after the end of Bullimore's previous musical projects, Nebulae (live drum and bass) and Bully Live (solo drum and bass). A former Salisbury College sound engineering student, Bullimore began singing on his own tracks and joined with old friend Dubose, whom he had known for many years, to embark on songwriting together. Bullimore and Dubose had previously trained together in martial arts. During this period, Stuart Anderson (who had previously been the drummer with Nebulae) joined the group and Phil Murphey (DJ) would later complete the original line-up. Career Since their formation, the Beatbullyz have had a busy career performing at local venues in Swindon. In 2008, they came 1st in Channel 4's unsigned band competition, which won them a chance to star in the soap opera Hollyoaks. In the same year, they released their album Rootz. In 2009, they got their break in the form of Radio 1's Big Weekend in Swindon, where they appeared on the \\"BBC Introducing\\" stage, introduced by Radio 1 DJ Huw Stephens. He invited them back for the Maida Vale Session in July. In August that year, they performed at the Moonfest as well as supporting Example in the later part of 2009. In February 2010, they shared a stage with Scouting for Girls and backed N Dubz on their tour throughout March into April. Dappy from N Dubz said \\"Beatbullyz are too unique, I love them, no-one sounds like them, Beatbullyz all the way man.\\" They played their own gigs throughout April, including a performance at the Playaway Festival. The next month they were back at Radio 1's Big Weekend in Wales where Fearne Cotten introduced them, pledging her support when they headlined the BBC Introducing stage. They released their debut single Skillz that May. In 2010 they shared a stage with Eliza Doolittle and performed at the Wireless Festival in July. They unveiled their second release, Bounce and then their third release Human Nature and the last release single Heartbeat Ft Lizzy Paterson.Beatbullyz played at the Big Arts Day in Swindon at Lydiard Park. They carried on touring, sharing the stage with such acts as Professor Green and Tinchy Stryder at Spa Bidlington. They recorded a track with, Lizzie Patterson, sister of Robert Patterson, in 2010. In August, they supported Jason Derulo on his UK tour as well as doing their own tour ending in February 2011. In September 2010, Beatbullyz released their album Human Nature and throughout December supported JLS on their tour across the UK in 2010. They supported Example in their hometown Swindon at the MECA. Bozo is featured on a track with another local from Swindon, Daine Gooden. In May 2011 they supported Coolio.

He is best known for his classic study The Making of Indian Foreign Policy (1970), which is considered a classic in Indian scholarship in International Relations. Career Before becoming an academic, Bandypadhyaya had been a diplomat, entering the Indian Foreign Service in 1955 and reaching the level of Undersecretary in the Ministry of External Affairs, before resigning in 1960 to take up a university post in Kolkata. He remained at Jadavpur University until his retirement in 1993, advancing to the rank of professor, among other positions. The Making of Indian Foreign Policy Bandyopadhyaya's classic study is still considered an indispensable guide to the foreign policy-making process in New Delhi. The book's strength comes from an unusual combination of scholarly rigor and inside knowledge. Bandyopadhyaya develops a distinctive contribution to IR theory through a ‚Äúhybrid‚Äù approach derived from Gandhi and Mao, on the one hand, and behavioralist systems theories, on the other. The study outlines the evolution of his thinking and the connections with his broader concerns with postcolonial nation-building. Influence Above all, Bandypadhyaya played a leading part in advancing Jadavpur University's School of International Relations and Strategic Studies, one of the few centers of political influence outside the national capital. The Making of Indian Foreign Policy is one of over a dozen books that Bandyopadhyaya has published on various topics. The majority of his works address the theory and practice of social and economic development in postcolonial states, particularly in China and India. They include studies of Indian nationalism and international communism (1966), and Gandhi's social and political thought (1969). Publications *Aspects of Soviet economy.

The Suspensory Act received the royal assent on the same day as the two Acts it suspended, on 18 September 1914. Background Welsh disestablishment and Irish home rule were both major policies of H. H. Asquith's Liberal government that had met with considerable controversy and parliamentary opposition in the 1910s. By the summer of 1914, however, the enactment of both measures seemed inevitable as the provisions set out by the Parliament Act 1911 had been met, allowing the Government to force them through, despite the opposition of the House of Lords, if it so chose. Upon the outbreak of war with Germany, the government had agreed a \\"political truce\\" with the opposition Conservative leader, Bonar Law. Asquith decided, however, that the two controversial bills should nevertheless be put to the King, together with a new bill suspending their operation; this prompted Law to lead a Unionist walk-out from the House of Commons. All three bills received the King's assent on the same day, 18 September. Effect of the Suspensory Act A short Act with only one substantive section, the Suspensory Act provided that \\"no steps shall be taken to put [the Government of Ireland Act] into operation\\", and that the \\"date of disestablishment\\" as defined by the Welsh Church Act would be postponed, until 18 September 1915; if the war were still under way at that time, the Government were empowered to push the two Acts' suspension further back. On 14 September 1915 an Order in Council made under the Suspensory Act suspended the Government of Ireland Act for a further six months (i.e. until 18 March 1916), and postponed Welsh disestablishment until the end of the war. A subsequent series of Orders in Council, dated 29 February 1916, 7 September 1916, 13 March 1917, 22 August 1917, 27 February 1918, 4 September 1918, 12 March 1919, 18 August 1919, 2 March 1920, and 13 August 1920 suspended the Irish Act in further blocks of six months until the Government of Ireland Act 1920 (passed 23 December 1920) repealed the 1914 Home Rule Act. However, the 1920 Act was never fully implemented either, due to the Irish War of Independence (culminating in the independence from the United Kingdom of most of Ireland as the Irish Free State); home rule was only established in Northern Ireland. Welsh disestablishment was further postponed by the Welsh Church (Temporalities) Act 1919 until 31 March 1920, when it finally went ahead.

Later in 2002 he was appointed as caretaker coach together with Rino Lavezzini in what turned out to be a troublesome season that ultimately ended in relegation (then annulled due to the so-called Caso Catania) for the club. He then returned working as youth coach for Genoa until 2009, when his former boss Luigi Simoni offered him a head coaching post at Lega Pro Seconda Divisione club Gubbio. Under his two-year tenure, Gubbio achieved a surprising feat of two consecutive promotions, thus reaching Serie B in June 2011 as league champions.

Ternary fission is a comparatively rare (0.2 to 0.4% of events) type of nuclear fission in which three charged products are produced rather than two. As in other nuclear fission processes, other uncharged particles such as multiple neutrons and gamma rays are produced in ternary fission. Ternary fission may happen during neutron-induced fission or in spontaneous fission (the type of radioactive decay). About 25% more ternary fission happens in spontaneous fission compared to the same fissioning system formed after thermal neutron capture, https://web- docs.gsi.de/~wolle/FISSION/ternary/ternary.html Fraction ternary fission as a function of different Z and A in fissile isotopes. illustrating that these processes remain physically slightly different, even after the absorption of the neutron, possibly because of the extra energy present in the nuclear reaction system of thermal neutron-induced fission. Quaternary fission, at 1 per 10 million fissions, is also known (see below).  Products  The most common nuclear fission process is \\"binary fission.\\" It produces two charged asymmetrical fission products with maximally probable charged products at mass numbers 95 ¬± 15 and 135 ¬± 15 . However, in this conventional fission of large nuclei, the binary process happens merely because it is the most energetically probable. In anywhere from 2 to 4 fissions per 1000 in a nuclear reactor, the alternative ternary fission process produces three positively charged fragments (plus neutrons, which are not charged and not counted in this reckoning). The smallest of the charged products may range from so small a charge and mass as a single proton (Z = 1), up to as large a fragment as the nucleus of argon (Z = 18). Although particles as large as argon nuclei may be produced as the smaller (third) charged product in the usual ternary fission, the most common small fragments from ternary fission are helium-4 nuclei, which make up about 90% of the small fragment products. This high incidence is related to the stability (high binding energy) of the alpha particle, which makes more energy available to the reaction. The second-most common particles produced in ternary fission are tritons (the nuclei of tritium), which make up 7% of the total small fragments, and the third-most are helium-6 nuclei (which decay with a half-life of about 0.8 seconds to lithium-6). Protons and larger nuclei are in the small fraction (< 2%) which make up the remainder of the small charged products. The two larger charged particles from ternary fission, particularly when alphas are produced, are quite similar in size distribution to those produced in binary fission.  Product energies  The energy of the third much-smaller product usually ranges between 10 and 20 MeV. In keeping with their origin, alpha particles produced by ternary fission typically have mean energies of about ~ 16 MeV (energies this great are never seen in alpha decay). Since these typically have significantly more energy than the ~ 5 MeV alpha particles from alpha decay, they are accordingly called \\"long range alphas\\" (referring to their longer range in air or other media). The other two larger fragments carry away, in their kinetic energies, the remainder of the fission kinetic energy (typically totalling ~ 170 MeV in heavy element fission) that does not appear as the 10 to 20 MeV kinetic energy carried away by the third smaller product. Thus, the larger fragments in ternary fission are each less energetic, by a typical 5 to 10 MeV, than they are seen to be in binary fission.  Importance  Although the ternary fission process is less common than the binary process, it still produces significant helium-4 and tritium gas buildup in the fuel rods of modern nuclear reactors.

J. Kliman, M. G. Itkis, S. Gmuca. World Scientific Publishing Co. Pte. Ltd. Singapore. (2008) This phenomenon was initially detected in 1957, within the environs of the Savannah River National Laboratory.  True ternary fission  A very rare type of ternary fission process is sometimes called \\"true ternary fission.\\" It produces three nearly equal-sized charged fragments (Z ~ 30) but only happens in about 1 in 100 million fission events. In this type of fission, the product nuclei split the fission energy in three nearly equal parts and have kinetic energies of ~ 60 MeV.  Quaternary fission  An even rarer fission process, occurring in about 1 in 1000 million fissions, is quaternary fission. It is analogous to ternary fission, save that four charged products are seen. Typically two of these are light particles, with the most common mode of quaternary fission apparently being two large particles and two alpha particles (rather than one alpha, the most common mode of ternary fission).

Mac Airt was later interned during the Irish Republican Army's Border Campaign of 1956-1962. Founding the PIRA Having retired at some earlier point Mac Airt returned to the republican movement in 1969, throwing his lot in with the newly established Provisional Irish Republican Army (PIRA) and their political arm Provisional Sinn F√©in. Indeed, in early 1970 his Padraig Pearse cumann, which he set up in the Clonard area of the Falls Road, was the first branch of Provisional Sinn F√©in established in Belfast and proved central to the growth of the dissident party in the city.Brian Feeney, Sinn F√©in: A Hundred Turbulent Years, Dublin, 2002, p. 261 In August 1970 Mac Airt was appointed editor of the Belfast-based Republican News, succeeding Jimmy Steele who had died soon after being appointed editor.English, Armed Struggle, p. 115 Despite his advancing age Mac Airt also became involved in the gun battles that raged between the republicans from Falls and loyalists from the neighbouring Shankill Road.Tim Pat Coogan, The Troubles: Ireland's Ordeal 1966‚Äì1995 and the Search for Peace, Hutchinson, 1995, p. 89 As a consequence Mac Airt became one of the leaders of the nascent PIRA in Belfast.Coogan, The Troubles, p. 112 Mac Airt was publicly named as a leading republican by General Anthony Farrar-Hockley who had commanded the British Army present during the clashes and with whom Mac Airt had held failed negotiations at the scene of conflict.Tim Pat Coogan, The IRA, Palgrave Macmillan, 2002, p. 373 He served as Adjutant to Billy McKee, who was first commander of the Provisional IRA Belfast Brigade.Ed Moloney, Voices from the Grave: Two Men's War in Ireland, Faber & Faber, 2011, p. 47 According to Brendan Hughes Mac Airt's Kane Street home doubled as Belfast Brigade headquarters at this early stage in the movement's history.Moloney, Voices from the Grave, p. 51 On 15 April 1971 Mac Airt, along with Billy McKee, was arrested by the British Army when found in possession of a hand gun. Both men were sentenced under the Explosive Substances Act 1883 and sent to Crumlin Road Gaol.Roy Garland, Gusty Spence, Blackstaff Press, 2001, p. 120 In the prison the two men were recognised as the leaders of the republican prisoners, a role held by Gusty Spence on the loyalist side. Mac Airt and McKee co- operated informally with Spence to maintain order until they agreed to establish an official Camp Council. The make-up of this group saw Mac Airt and McKee representing the PIRA, Spence and an associate identified only as \\"Robert\\" representing the Ulster Volunteer Force and Ned McCreery and James Craig as Ulster Defence Association delegates, with members of the Official IRA and Irish National Liberation Army eventually added.Garland, Gusty Spence, pp. 167‚Äì168 Later activity Mac Airt was involved in the talks held between republicans and clergymen from various Protestant churches held at Feakle on 12 December 1974.

The plaintiff was a seaman on board the ship Alexander, of which the defendant was master and commander. The Alexander was bound on a voyage to Lisbon, and whilst the ship was on her voyage the defendant, in consideration that the plaintiff would perform some extra work in navigating the ship, promised to pay him five guineas over and above his common wages. The plaintiff proved that the ship had been in danger and that the commander, to induce the seamen to exert themselves had made the promise stated in the declaration. The issue was whether the reformation of the contract was enforceable. The reformation of the contract to provide extra wages in exchange for extra work under exigent circumstances was not enforceable for public policy reasons. If such an agreement were enforceable it would enable sailors to act opportunistically while at sea. Lord Kenyon at 103: If this action was to be supported, it would materially affect the navigation of this kingdom. It has been long since determined, that when the freight is lost, the wages are also lost. This rule was founded on a principle of policy, for if sailors were in all events to have their wages, and in times of danger entitled to insist on an extra charge on such a promise as this, they would in many cases suffer a ship to sink, unless the captain would pay any extravagant demand they might think proper to make.

She announced on 12 April 2014 that she would run in the 2014 presidential election though she was unable to collect enough endorsements to run. Kamel hosted an Egyptian radio program called Nighttime Confessions from 1992 to 1998. She later worked as a new presenter for Egyptian state television, and hosted a show called Please Understand Me on the Saudi Arabian-owned Orbit satellite TV network. In each assignment, she eventually encountered official resistance: Confessions was cancelled after outcries by religious conservatives; she took a leave of absence from Egyptian state television rather than participate in propaganda surrounding the 2005 elections; and Understand Me was taken off the air by the Saudi producers when they became concerned that its coverage of the 2011 Egyptian revolution would implicate Saudi interests.

Life According to his autobiography, Hanshan Deqing entered a monastic school in Nanjing‚Äôs Bao‚Äôen temple at the age of twelve. While there he studied literature as well as religious subjects and began writing poetry when he was 17. Two years later he was ordained as a Chan monk under the Buddhist name of Cheng Yin. When the monastery burned down in 1566, he busied himself for some years in keeping the community together and raising money for repairs. Then in 1571 he set out as a religious wanderer, going from monastery to monastery in search of instruction and growing in meditative attainment. After four years he settled on Mount Wutai but by 1583 he had become famous as a Buddhist Master and set out travelling to remote areas again. It was at this time that he prefixed his name with that of Hanshan Peak so as to return to anonymity. In consequence of having organized a successful ceremony to ensure the birth of a male heir to the throne while he was still at Mount Wutai, Hanshan obtained the patronage of the emperor's mother. With her support he was able eventually to establish a new monastery at Mount Lao on the coast of the Shandong Peninsula. But when relations between the Wanli Emperor and his mother broke down over the choice of heir, Hanshan was caught in a conflict which also included tensions between Daoists and Buddhists. The background to this conflict is outlined in Zhang, Dewei, Challenging the Reigning Emperor for Success: Hanshan Deqing and Late Ming Court Politics, Journal of the American Oriental Society 2014 In 1595, he was put on trial and imprisoned, then afterwards exiled to the Guangdong area. While there, he made himself socially useful and also helped restore Nanhua Temple at Caoxi which, since the time that Huineng was entombed there, had been converted into a meat market. Some of the monks at the temple made a false accusation of embezzlement of the restoration funds against him and, though he was acquitted, he did not return there. Between 1611-22 Hanshan resumed his wanderings from monastery to monastery and also continued writing the religious expositions and commentaries he had begun during his exile. Shortly before his death in 1623 he returned south to Caoxi, where his body was eventually enshrined. The autobiography of Master Han Shan, pp.6-39 Religious teaching Hanshan Deqing is regarded as one of the great reformers of Chinese Buddhism during the later Ming Dynasty, renowned as a lecturer and commentator and admired for his strict adherence to the precepts. Like many of his contemporaries, he advocated the dual practice of the Ch√°n and Pure Land methods and advocated the use of the ni√†nf√≥ (Âøµ‰Ωõ) technique to purify the mind for the attainment of self-realization. He also directed practitioners in the use of mantras, as well as scripture reading.Keown, Damien.

In 1969 it was taken over by Robb-Caledon Shipbuilders, which in turn was nationalised in 1977 as part of British Shipbuilders. In the 1970s the Burntisland yard switched from shipbuilding to prefabricating modules of superstructure for offshore oil platforms, but orders were intermittent and by the 1980s the yard was largely idle. In 1990 new owners returned the yard to production as Burntisland Fabrications or BiFab, resuming the manufacture of superstructure modules for oil platforms. Under a management buyout in 2001 the Burntisland yard returned to being an independent company. Founding and early years Brothers Amos and Wilfrid Ayre founded Burntisland Shipbuilding Co. in 1918 as a First World War emergency shipyard. Its yard at Burntisland West Dock had four berths and capacity to build ships up to long and up to beam. However, until the 1950s Burntisland built relatively few vessels more than about long and beam. The yard was connected to the North British Railway by an extensive internal rail network that carried steel to various parts of the yard. Burntisland's first three vessels were standard \\"C\\" type cargo ships of just over 3,100 GRT each for the UK Government's wartime Shipping Controller, laid down in 1918 as hull numbers 101, 102 and 103. They were after the Armistice: hull 101 in June as , 102 in September as and 103 in November as . Burntisland's first peacetime order was for a pair of 2,300 GRT cargo steamers for Compagnie Lasry of Oran, Algeria. Hulls 104 and 105 were as Nelly Lasry and Sidney Lasry. In the 1920s the yard built merchant ships ranging from coasters of about 600 tons to ocean-going cargo ships of up to 4,700 tons GRT. Most common were ocean-going four- or five-hold tramp steamers of 1,500 to 2,500 tons. The yard also built a number of arch-deck colliers from 900 to 2,300 tons GRT. Burntisland built numerous flatiron colliers with low superstructures, hinged funnel and hinged or telescopic mast(s) to fit under bridges upriver from the Pool of London on the River Thames. Burntisland's first flatiron was hull 119, as the 932 GRT coastal collier Wandle for the Wandsworth, Wimbledon and Epsom District Gas Company. From 1923 to 1946 Burntisland built a further 11 colliers for the same customer, which from 1932 was called the Wandsworth and District Gas Company. Surviving the Great Depression Being built in 1918 the yard was modern, well-equipped and thus well-placed to compete during the Great Depression. In 1929 the company introduced its \\"Burntisland Economy\\" ship design, intended for maximum fuel efficiency. The concept was popular with ship-owners during the depression and Burntisland continued the design with a succession of developments during the 1930s. Some ships that Burntisland built for shipping companies went on to become Empire ships under the Ministry of War Transport in the Second World War. Hull 164, as Roxburgh, became in 1942. Hull 207, as Ginnheim, became Empire Ouse in 1945. Burntisland continued to build numerous colliers. Hulls 171 and 172, as Alexander Kennedy and Ferranti, were a pair of 1,315 GRT flatirons for the London Power Company, which operated Battersea Power Station and Deptford Power Station. Burntisland went on to build six further colliers for the LPC between 1933 and 1945. on her maiden voyage, October 1932 Hull 173 was launched in 1932 as , a 1,482 GRT flatirons for the Wandsworth, Wimbledon and Epsom District Gas Company. She replaced the previous Wandle that Burntisland had built for the same owner in 1922 (see above). Hull 174 was as London Queen, a 781 GRT coaster for the London and Channel Islands Shipping Company. Her owners became British Channel Islands Shipping Co, for whom Burntisland launched a further seven ships between 1937 and 1948. Hulls 178 and 179, launched in 1933 and 1934 as Pulborough and Petworth, were for Stephenson, Clarke and Associates. Burntisland went on to build eight ships for Stephenson, Clarke spread over nearly 30 years, the last being hull 398 as MV Gilsland. Hull 184, as , was Burntisland's first diesel ship. She was a 403 GRT coaster with a Humboldt- Deutz engine and was built for T.J. Metcalf of London. Burntisland built a second Humboldt-Deutz-engined motor coaster for Metcalf, hull 196, that was as . Hulls 191 and 192, launched in 1935 as Corbrae and Corburn, were for William Cory & Son. Over the next 21 years Burntisland went on to build a total of 17 colliers for Cory, the last two being hulls 376 and 378 as MV Corstar and MV Corsea. Hulls 193‚Äì195 were a trio of flatirons launched in successive years as Fulham in 1935, Fulham II in 1936 and Fulham III in 1937. They were built for the Metropolitan Borough of Fulham to supply Fulham Power Station. Burntisland went on to build six further flatirons for Fulham between 1938 and 1948. Hull 213, as MV Derrymore, was a 4,799 GRT cargo ship for McCowen and Gross of London. Burntisland went on to build a further five ships for McCowen and Gross between 1938 and 1951. Second World War 250px 250px 250px During the Second World War Burntisland continued to concentrate on building merchant ships. However, in 1943 it also built three s: , and . In May 1941 Burntisland launched hull 233 as Merton, the first of several large standard-design 7,195 GRT cargo ships for the Carlton Steam Ship Co of Newcastle upon Tyne. War shipping needs and losses called for an unprecedented rate of shipbuilding. In July, August and October 1941 Burntisland launched three further large ships of the same standard design for Carlton. They included , which was torpedoed and sunk off the North Cape in July 1942 less than a year after her launch. Burntisland launched a further two large ships per year for Carlton in 1942‚Äì44. Also in 1941, Burntisland started to build colliers for the Gas Light and Coke Company to supply Beckton Gas Works in east London. Hull 235 was launched in April as the 2,816 GRT Adams Beck. Burntisland went on to build five further colliers for the GL&CC; in the 1940s. In 1942 Burntisland launched hull 264 as the 7,043 GRT cargo ship MV Highland Prince for Prince Line. In 1944 hull 280 was launched as the 7,150 GRT MV Scottish Prince. Burntisland went on to build eight further merchant ships for Prince line between 1946 and 1960. Burntisland built a number of war standard ships for the Ministry of War Transport, including the 7,290 GRT hulls 261 and 266 launched as Empire Rosalind and Empire Glory in 1942 and 1943. Other MoWT orders included two merchant aircraft carriers: hull 268 as and hull 277 as . Hulls 291 to 294 were launched in February and March 1944 as CHANT 66 to CHANT 69: part of the large CHANT fleet of 400 GRT prefabricated coastal tankers. Wartime demand rose so high that in 1944‚Äì45 Burntisland subcontracted orders for five coasters to Hall, Russell & Company of Aberdeen: hulls 270, 273, 274, 276 and 281. In April 1945 Burntisland launched hull 290, the 7,541 GRT for the British-India Steam Navigation Company. BI ordered two more cargo ships from Burntisland after the war (see below). Completion of MoWT orders continued after the surrender of Germany with the launches of hull 298 in May 1945 as the 1,337 GRT coaster and finally hull 289 in July as the 7,134 GRT cargo ship MV Empire Calshot. Post-war production Burntisland continued to build colliers after the war. Hulls 295 and 301, as Chessington and Mitcham, were the last two flatirons for the Wandsworth and District Gas Co. Hull 328 was as MV Adams Beck for the GL&CC.; Under the Gas Act 1948 the Wandsworth and District Gas Co became part of South Eastern Gas Board, whom Burntisland supplied with five further flatirons between 1949 and 1956. Hulls 307 and 308, and 1948 as the 1,776 GRT MV Fulham VIII and 1,759 GRT MV Fulham IX, were the last two flatirons for Fulham Borough Council before the Electricity Act 1947 nationalised Britain's electricity supply industry. Burntisland supplied one collier for the new state-owned British Electricity Authority: hull 341, as the 1,837 GRT Brimsdown, named after Brimsdown Power Station in north London. Burntisland maintained its reputation for high quality tramps and cargo- liners. By 1945 a majority of orders were for motor vessels. Hulls 316 and 317 were a pair of 3,668 GRT sister ships for British-India S.N. Co launched in 1948 as and . Each had a Barclay Curle-Doxford three-cylinder diesel engine. Hulls 319‚Äì321 were launched for the newly founded Christensen Canadian African Lines as the 3,623 GRT MV Thorshall in May 1948, 3,632 GRT MV Thorstrand in December 1948 and 3,713 GRT MV Thorsisle in March 1949. Each ship had a Hawthorn Leslie-Doxford four-cylinder diesel engine. Hull 330 was as MV Sycamore, a 3,343 GRT cargo ship for Johnston Warren Lines of Liverpool. Further orders from Johnston Warren Lines were hulls 353 and 355 as the 3,596 GRT MV Beechmore and 3,597 GRT MV Pinemore, and hull 385 as the 6,659 GRT cargo ship MV Mystic. Hulls 334 and 335 were a pair of 3,364 GRT cargo liners for Prince line, as and . Each ship had a 300 BHP Hawthorn Leslie four- cylinder diesel engine, a top speed of and accommodation for 12 passengers. Hull 337 was launched in February 1951 as MV Derrymore, a 5,678 GRT cargo ship that replaced one of the same name that Burntisland built for the same customer in 1938. Before the end of 1951 the new Derrymore passed to O. Gross's Power Steam Ship Co as MV Huntsmore. Burntisland built three further ships for Power S.S. Co between 1954 and 1958. Hull 349 was launched in September 1952 as MV Master Nicos, an 8,453 GRT cargo ship for Motores Maritimos Compa√±√≠a Limitada, a Greek-owned company registered in Costa Rica. From February 1952 until her launch the resident engineer supervising Master Nicos construction was Victoria Drummond MBE, the first British woman to have qualified as a marine engineer. During and after the Second World War the demand for larger cargo ships increased. Burntisland's slipways and berths were limited in size, but in the 1950s the yard managed to build a number of ships of more than length and beam. Hull 347, launched in 1954 as the 6,515 GRT for Power S.S. Co, had a length and beam of and . Hull 362, launched in 1956 as the 8,390 GRT (11,850 DWT) for the Tramp Chartering Corporation of Piraeus, had a length, beam and draught of , and . Hull 367, launched in October 1956 as the 1,873 GRT MV Kingston, was the final flatiron collier for the South Eastern Gas Board. She also turned out to be the last of 28 flatirons that Burntisland had built for various customers over a period of 34 years. In the 1950s The Scottish and Mercantile Investment Co bought a majority shareholding in the company. However, the Ayre brothers continued to manage the business. By the mid-1950s orders were sufficient for Burntisland to subcontract two coasters to Hall Russell in Aberdeen. In 1956 Hall Russell launched hull 378 as the 3,373 GRT MV Corsea for Wm. Cory. Hull 379 was launched in Aberdeen as for Glen and Company of Glasgow and completed in 1957. Winga proved to be Burntisland's last steam-powered ship. =Turbine steamers= In the 1950s there were far fewer orders for ships with reciprocating steam engines. However, geared steam turbines are more compact, more powerful and less vibratory than reciprocating engines. Early in the 1950s Burntisland took two orders for steam turbine cargo ships. The first order was for a pair of ore carriers for the Panamanian Pan Ore Steam Ship Co, Inc. Hull 352 was as the 5,000 GRT . Her sister ship hull 351 was launched in 1954 as the 4,952 GRT . David Rowan and Company of Glasgow, part of Lithgows Limited, built the turbines and reduction gearing for both ships. The second turbine order was hull 377, launched in 1956 as for Skibs A/S Geirulv (Gjeruldsen & Tambs) of Arendal, Norway. Her turbine was built by Scotts of Greenock on the River Clyde. Cancellations and redundancies In the 1950s Burntisland suffered a number of cancelled orders. Hull 365 was cancelled in 1954 and hull 368 in 1955, but worse came with the cancellation of six hulls in 1959‚Äì60. The first three cancelled hulls were all for Power S.S. Co. in about 1959. The last cancellation was hull 396 for Prince Line in about 1960. This left hull 395, launched as the 4,800 GRT MV Lancastrian Prince, as Burntisland's last completed order for Prince Line. By 2 July 1959 Burntisland Shipbuilding had laid off 100 workers and it was rumoured in the House of Commons that the company was to close down. On 30 October 1959 a new Labour MP, Harry Gourlay, whose Kirkcaldy Burghs constituency included Burntisland, made his maiden speech to the House of Commons. In it he reported that in 1957 about 1,700 people had been employed in shipyards in Kirkcaldy and Burntisland but this workforce had now been reduced to about 800. On 26 July 1962 Harry Gourlay again expressed concern in the Commons that Burntisland Shipbuilding had made a number of its employees redundant. However, the Conservative MP Frederick Erroll, President of the Board of Trade, replied that the redundancies had not increased unemployment in Burntisland. On 5 November 1962 Gourlay told the Commons that he blamed the Conservative Government's economic policy for the decline of shipbuilding in the United Kingdom. William Whitelaw MP, Parliamentary Secretary to the Minister of Labour, denied this and replied that the Ministry of Labour planned to create a centre in Fife to retrain redundant workers for alternative employment. On 14 March and 27 May 1963 and Gourlay told the Commons that Burntisland Shipbuilding had cut its workforce from about 1,500 in 1961 to just over 500 in 1963. (An alternative source states that in 1961 Burntisland had 1,000 employees.) On 14 March Gourlay pleaded for small shipyards on the east coast of Scotland such as Burntisland to be awarded War Department contracts and on 27 May he claimed in the Commons that the Local Employment Act had not led to the creation of any new jobs in Burntisland. Whitelaw conceded that the number of shipyard workers unemployed in Burntisland had risen from six in May 1961 to 116 in May 1963. In 1963 Sir Wilfrid Ayre retired after 45 years at the head of the company. 1960s production Metcalf Motor Coasters renewed its relationship with Burntisland by ordering five new coastal tankers: hull 399 launched in 1961 as MV Ann M, hull 404 as MV John M, hull 410 as MV Frank M, hull 411 launched in 1965 as MV Nicholas M and finally hull 417 as MV Eileen M. Burntisland succeeded in securing orders from notable customers. Hull 402, launched in 1962 as MV Montreal City and hull 406, launched in 1964 as MV Halifax City were sister ships of just over 6,500 GRT for Bristol City Line. Hull 403, launched in 1962 as MV Beaverpine, was a 4,514 GRT cargo ship for Canadian Pacific Steamships. Hulls 407 and 408, launched in 1964 as MV Newfoundland and MV Nova Scotia, were a pair of 6,660 GRT sister ships for Furness Withy. Hulls 414 and 415 were also coastal tankers, built as specialist liquid gas carriers. The sister ships were launched for the Nile Steam Ship Co as MV Teviot in 1965 and MV Traquair in 1966 respectively. Burntisland also built a larger tanker, hull 416, as the 3,971 GRT MV Olau Mark for Olau Line of Denmark. =MV Ohrmazd and receivership= Hull 418 was launched in April 1967 as the 11,046 GRT , a fast passenger and cargo liner for the East & West Steamship Company of Karachi, Pakistan. However, protracted negotiations with Ohrmazds owners over the ship's specification delayed her completion until November 1968. This activated a penalty clause in the building contract from which Burntisland Shipbuilding proved unable to recover, and the company went into receivership in 1968. On 20 December 1968 the Burntisland yard was facing closure and a Conservative MP, James Prior, told the Commons that he hoped it could be averted, but on 22 January 1969 the announcement was made that the yard would close. The next day, 23 January, the Commons debated the Labour Government's Shipbuilding Industry Bill. The Labour MP Gerald Fowler, Joint Parliamentary Secretary to the Ministry of Technology, told the House: > \\"We in the Ministry of Technology have spared no effort to find, if we can, > a commercial solution to this problem to keep this yards in shipbuilding, > and the hon. Member for Kirkcaldy Burghs (Mr. Gourlay) has made as strenuous > an effort to save this yard, as could be expected of any constituency > Member, and all credit is due to him for that, and I hope that his efforts > and ours will be rewarded with success.\\" Under the Shipbuilding Act 1967 the Labour Government offered credit to help the shipbuilding industry. Therefore, during 23 January debate Edward Garrett, Labour MP for Wallsend asked the Minister of Technology, Tony Benn MP, about Burntisland Shipbuilding, \\"Is it true that since the credit facilities became available little attempt has been made by management, and, I fear, by the Minister, to ascertain whether the medium and small yards are being helped to become more economic?\\" A day later, 24 January, the Scottish National Party MP Winnie Ewing asked in the Commons if the Ministry of Technology would form a government holding company to buy the Burntisland yard and keep it and all its employees at work. Gerald Fowler said that it would not, and \\"the best hope of a long-term solution would be if a shipbuilding undertaking which can find orders capable of being carried out profitably at this yard were to take it over\\". On 29 January in the Commons Willie Hamilton, Labour MP for West Fife, called for a public enquiry into the causes of the Burntisland yard's closure. In his reply, Gerald Fowler said: > \\"I hope that we can reach a commercial and viable solution which will enable > the yard to stay in production. However, I must point out that the > assistance voted by this House in the Shipbuilding Industry Act was meant to > be used not to save uneconomic yards but to assist reorganisation with a > view to promoting competitiveness in the industry. If the Burntisland yard > fits that pattern, I shall be pleased, but I do not think that an inquiry > would help us as of now.\\" =Final ships= Burntisland launched four more ships after launching Ohrmazd. Hull 419, as MV Peter Schr√∂der and hull 420, as MV Paul Schr√∂der, were a pair of cargo ships each of just over 5,000 GRT for Reederei Richard Schr√∂der of Hamburg, Germany. Hull 421, launched in 1968 as MV Christiane Bolten, was a similar cargo ship for another Hamburg customer, the long- established August Bolten William Miller's Nachfolger. Hull 422 was the yard's final vessel, another cargo ship similar to the Peter Schr√∂der and Paul Schr√∂der. She was launched in April 1969 as for the St. Vincent Shipping Co. of Liverpool and completed ahead of schedule that July. The yard then made about 800 of its remaining workers redundant. On 30 April 1970, during another Shipbuilding Bill debate in the Commons, the Liberal MP Jo Grimond asked \\"Is there any news about the site at Burntisland? ... I understand that it is out of shipbuilding. Is it out of the industry altogether? Is it being used on prefabrication or for any other purpose?\\" Harold Lever MP, Paymaster General, replied that the Burntisland yard \\"is now satisfactorily in the East Scotland Group and quite active.\\" Grimond immediately asked \\"Will it build again?\\", to which Lever replied \\"I think it is building now. It is functioning well in another reasonably successful group.\\" Burntisland's new owner was Robb-Caledon Shipbuilders of Leith and Dundee. On 31 January 1972 Gourlay told the Commons \\"Now there are only 80 persons employed there [i.e. at Burntisland yard], and even their jobs are in jeopardy unless something is done very soon.\\" His Labour colleague Dick Douglas MP added: > \\"My hon. Friend indicates a specific problem. It may be that the good > offices of the Department can be used to ensure that some of the work that > Robb Caledon takes on board is dispersed not only to the Burntisland yard > but to the Dundee yard, in view of the present high level of unemployment. > The male rate is running at 12.3 per cent., and the local figure is 9.8 per > cent. of the insured population of Dundee and Broughty Ferry.\\" Burntisland still built no more ships, and on 11 February 1972 Robb-Caledon made another 10 workers at Burntisland redundant In the Commons on 6 March 1972 Gourlay again pleaded for Government money to help keep the yard open. The Conservative MP Nicholas Ridley replied that the Department for Trade and Industry had no proposals to help Robb-Caledon. Robb-Caledon eventually removed Burntisland's equipment to its other yards. Offshore oil and gas fabrications Robb-Caledon eventually succeeded in attracting orders to build structures for Scotland's North Sea oil and natural gas industry. By December 1972 Burntisland was building a structure for Shell's Auk oilfield. This was followed in 1973 by an order for modules for North Sea oil platforms. By November 1974 Robb-Caledon had formed a Burntisland Engineering Fabricators (BEF) subsidiary and the yard was building modules for the Norwegian sector of the North Sea, but Gourlay complained in the Commons that the yard had lost a potential order for an oil rig to an overseas competitor for reasons of cost and \\"the geographical conditions on the site\\". In April 1975 John Smith MP, Under-Secretary of State for the Department of Energy told the Commons that BEF was one of the UK's two largest constructors for the offshore oil and gas industry. It had not secured orders for offshore platforms but had become the UK's leading builder of modules to fit on them. In December 1975 Gregor Mackenzie MP, a minister at the Department of Industry told the Commons that his department had lent BEF ¬£450,000 under the Industry Act 1972, had given its parent company Robb-Caledon a ¬£400,000 loan and almost ¬£1.1 million in grants and the company was also eligible for grants under the Local Employment Act. =Nationalisation and closure= Burntisland Fabrications yard in 2008 Under the Aircraft and Shipbuilding Industries Act 1977 the Labour Government nationalised the UK's shipbuilding industry. Robb-Caledon became a wholly owned subsidiary of British Shipbuilders, which thereby held a 52% share in BEF. On 7 January 1979 Burntisland was nearing completion of its current order and Gourlay asked in the Commons whether the Secretary of State for Industry \\"will hold discussions to ensure the continuing operation of the yard at Burntisland when the present contract is completed\\". Les Huckfield MP replied on behalf of the Secretary of State \\"Although there are no further orders in prospect for the yard, British Shipbuiders is using its best endeavours to sell the yard as a going concern, thereby preserving employment\\". On 24 October 1979 Gourlay told the Commons of the closure of the Burntisland yard and asked what George Younger MP, Secretary of State for Scotland would do to help the unemployed to find to re-employment. =Revival= In 1990 under new owners Burntisland West Dock resumed the production of major offshore oil and gas fabrications. In 2001 a management buyout took over the yard as Burntisland Fabrications or BiFab. The company now also owns a yard at Methil in Fife and a facility at Arnish on Lewis in the Outer Hebrides. Football club In 1919 a recreation fund was established, funded by a weekly subscription from the workers' wages. The fund created a cricket team, bowls team and two football teams. In 1925 the football teams were constituted as Burntisland Shipyard Amateur F.C., and since 1929 the club has competed in the qualifying stages of the Scottish Cup. The club is a member of the Kingdom Caledonian Football League.

The theater was listed on the National Register of Historic Places in 2009. Opened on September 22, 1926, the theater had seating for 1,949 patrons, and was used for both motion pictures and vaudeville shows. It was built at a reported cost of $750,000. It was designed by Richard Mortimer Bates Jr., with an exterior in a Mission/Spanish Colonial Revival style. The facade features Churrigueresque detailing of floral patterns and cartouche relief. The interior contains Adamesque references and murals by Anthony Heinsbergen. The theater closed briefly during the Depression for renovations. Exterior renovations in 1935 were designed by noted theater architect S. Charles Lee, and included an Art Deco ticket kiosk made of red-painted metal, unvarnished aluminum and glass; new lobby doors; and terrazzo sunburst paving in the foyer and front sidewalk. One of the theater's intact features is an original steel- frame, three-story neon sign on its roof. The Westlake was operated as a first-run movie theater from 1926 until the 1960s. As the neighborhood's demographics changed, the theater was sold to Metropolitan Theatres Corp., which showed Spanish-language or Spanish-subtitled movies. In 1991, the building was sold to Mayer Separzadeh, who converted the theater into a swap meet. To protect the building from drastic changes, the building was declared a Los Angeles Historic-Cultural Monument in September 1991. The theater was purchased by the now-defunct Community Redevelopment Agency of the City of Los Angeles in 2008. The CRA announced plans to rehabilitate the theater as a venue for live theater, film, music, and other performances. Progress under the CRA/LA was slow. In 2018, the theater was sold for $2 million to Jamison Services, a real estate development company based in Koreatown, which said it had plans to restore the theater.

Through his work, Buthelezi wants to mediate and communicate hope. He is convinced that seeing his works and his history, people are able to realise that in South Africa there are many opportunities, too, and that it is possible to create a better life and a career out of nothing; making art would enable people to change their lives and to contribute something positive to the world.Interview on a german South Africa-Blog Buthelezi states about his style: ‚ÄúI now have 18 different techniques, each of which have subtle differences from the other.

Mantzaris pioneered the use of computers as a printmaking and art- making tool in the early to mid-1980s, exhibiting widely, nationally and throughout Asia in touring exhibitions, to considerable acclaim.Professor Sasha Grishin, NKEW, 19 February 2001, p.16.'Encounters of the Ethnic Kind‚Äô, The Examiner, 6 June 1990.John Neylon, Art & Text, 1988, p.67 Her practice now crosses into several fields associated with the visual arts, printmaking, drawing, photography, sculpture, performance and public art. She is represented in most state and public collections throughout Australia and significant private collections throughout Asia and Europe. Early life and education Mantzaris was born in Melbourne, Australia. In the late 1970s she studied fine art (Painting) at RMIT University. Career Working quite outside the drift of theoretical attitudes and trends, Diane Mantzaris is widely regarded as being one of the first, and is the first Australian artist, to use computers as a printmaking tool. Mantzaris has exhibited widely, to considerable acclaim, debate, and even on occasion opposition, in both in her native Australia and overseas.Australian printmaking in the 1990s: artist printmakers, 1990-1995, Professor Sasha Grishin, Craftsman House, 1997, pp 6-9Contemporary Australian printmaking: an interpretative history, Professor Sasha Grishin, Craftsman House, 1994, p 133'Unfamiliar Territory' catalogue essay by Professor Jenny Zimmer, Art Gallery of South Australia, 1992 Mantzaris began realising her imagery via computer technology during its infancy. During a period when it was the domain of the freakish few, and an almost exclusively male domain at that, Mantzaris was seriously addressing the computer's new potential for making an art that would be accessible to the masses. Her work is unconventional but not for the sake of novelty, but as a conscious artistic strategy to subvert through existing assumptions on art, culture and society. Some artists seek out a tradition which they then colonise and to which they make their own contribution. These artists we call settlers. Others, who are very few in numbers, are explorers, people who venture off and discover new paths and to map out unfamiliar terrain. Diane Mantzaris belongs to that rare breed.'A Changing Agenda', Professor Sasha Grishin, NKEW newspaper 19 February 2001 The imagery in Mantzaris‚Äô early black and white, computer-generated lithographs are both startling and confronting. With titles such as ‚Äòthe Narcissist‚Äô and ‚ÄòHer Alter-Ego‚Äô, these works look like a cross between engravings of Sigmund Freud‚Äôs casebook and the photography of Diane Arbus. They are both different and yet unsettling in their recall of images stored in our collective memory bank. Amid the sameness of so much contemporary art Mantzaris‚Äôs computer-generated lithographs have the look of something not seen before and are especially appreciated.'College encounter makes Underdale trip worthwhile', Margot Osborne, The Advertiser, 19 October 1988 > The mix of computer graphics and private symbolism sponsors some unsettling > images. The grainy quality of the print and the deliberate exploitation of > folk idioms conveys the cosiness of a petit-point sampler, but closer > observation reveals the little peasant girls to be surrounded by horrors ‚Äì > Madonna‚Äôs with bleeding eyes and Christ children with blazing heads. > Symbolic sentiment is twisted like the roses which clamber up the torso of > one heroine, beginning to ensnare and smother and reveal their true nature > as electronic flex cable. It seems incongruous that the pictorial traditions > of particularly devotional and martyr art should be so emphatically quoted > using state of the art technology. Other works (The Sybil, The Narcissist) > point to less encumbered expression.

The split toe shoes and head band add a humorous note while > the power cord whips around like a wayward umbilical cord. This is more > computer-funk than angst.'Encounters' review, John Neylon, Art & Text, Vol > 31, 1989, pp 65-67 Whilst Mantzaris‚Äôs practice was met with considerable opposition from printmaking traditionalists and institutions at that time, and the subject of its ‚Äòlegitimate use‚Äô debated in forums,'Artists Views' PCA Imprint Vol 25, No1, pp 10-11 she also paved the way for artists that followed and computers were later adopted into art school university curricula. In 1987 Mantzaris was granted a three-month Australia Council residency in Tokyo. In the same year she exhibited a large body of computer-generated lithographs in the solo exhibition ‚ÄòModern Legends‚Äô at 200 Gertrude Street Gallery, Melbourne. These works were toured in exhibitions in public and regional galleries throughout Australia, including: ‚ÄòEncounters 1', curated by Stephanie Britton, at the South Australian School of Art; ‚ÄòMy Head is a Map‚Äô, curated by Roger Butler at the Australian National Gallery. The works then toured through Asia, in such exhibitions as: ‚Äò6x6‚Äô, which was the first exhibition of prints to tour Thailand, co-ordinated by Asialink and curated Anne Kirker (now curator of Asian Art), it was later hosted at the Queensland Art Gallery. Mantzaris returned to Tokyo in 1990, for ‚ÄòTokyo Connection‚Äô, an exhibition of work by artists who had been awarded the Australian artists‚Äô studio in Tokyo. Works such as the computer-generated lithograph Fuji Mart Builder (1987) were reproduced widely in the printed media. In the late 1980s to early 1990s, when scanners had become accessible home-technology, Mantzaris began incorporating collage into her prints. In a work from this period, Beauty Queen No.14 (Cherry Blossom) (1991), depicting a Japanese man wearing a gown, the shifting layers of imagery are combined with frequent references to the act of seeing, so that the viewer is presented with numerous images depending on their vantage point; thus presenting multi-layered interpretations. The work is less a commentary on Japanese culture than an interrogation of the viewers' perceptions of love, sexuality, taboos and customs. The piece was part of a larger series of boxed constructions of layered laser-printed transparencies which were shown in part at the 1992 Adelaide Biennale of Australian Art, ‚ÄòUnfamiliar Territory‚Äô, Art Gallery of South Australia, curated by Tim Morell. Professor Jenny Zimmer wrote of these works that the optical vibration and boxed coffined images convey the private hells, dilemmas and ironies of public existence.'Unfamiliar Territory' catalogue essay, Jenny Zimmer, Adelaide Biennial of Australian Art, Art Gallery of South Australia,1992 In 1992-93 Mantzaris was granted an Asialink residency at the Silpakorn University in Bangkok, Thailand. It was during this residency that Mantzaris made an extensive body of large thermal wax transfer prints dealing with the military repression and accounts of the crackdown witnessed first-hand during \\"Black May\\". Major works such as Dance the Backstep (Behind the smile of greed), and Slaves of State (1993) cleverly subverted the officially sanctioned view of the dynamics of Thai and Australian politics.Professor Sasha Grishin, Australian printmaking in the 1990s: artist printmakers, 1990-1995:'Diane Mantzaris', Craftsman House, 1997, pp 6-9 These works have become potent social manifestos which engage with the social and political issues of Australia and its Asian neighbours on several levels.Professor Sasha Grishin, 'Diane Mantzaris / Diane Mantzarisov√°', 'Australian Graphic Arts', Grapheion, Vol 3-4, 2000 The prints which grew out of these experiences brought together her perceptions of life in Bangkok, an awareness of the heritage of protest poster art, combined with mastery of a technology-based art practice, to produce prints of a nightmarish intensity where lynching parties and institutions of culture co-exist. In 2000, Mantzaris‚Äô interests shifted to exhibiting outside the gallery and into public spaces. She was engaged to develop concepts for the design and manufacture of two public art works. She would envisage working class ideology on a monumental scale, across two major freeway interventions en route into and out of the western suburbs of Melbourne The project had the invested interests of 7 western councils, Victorian State Government, Vicroads, with Mantzaris working in association with BM architects. Billboard installation 'Working Class heroes' was shelved after dozens of relocations pre-construction and 4 years of meetings with local authorities, whilst being covered and supported by the art community and media.'Urban Design and Public Art Alliances ARTLINK Feature: by Andy Miller, Sculpture and Cities, Volume 20 no 4 ‚ÄôHouse in the Sky‚Äô, is: a house-sized 2D sculpture of a 3D drawing in fabricated steel, suspended across a busy freeway, the western ringroad interchange. The generic home in 2D is designed to flip out into the motorists' view on passing, before disappearing from view. At least on one level, it was conceived as a working class dream home, one which had once been achievable by many migrants who had arrived in Australia in destitute circumstances. Mantzaris currently works from her studio in Northcote, Melbourne and she continues to work and exhibit within Australia and Asia.

Hall, a relative unknown from Clayton High School in South Jersey, was playing against Tony Costner at the time and doing a good job of holding Overbrook High School's Parade All- America center to a standoff.\\" He went on to Temple to play for coach Don Casey in the East Coast Conference. After playing sparingly as a freshman, Hall broke out as a sophomore in 1981‚Äì82, averaging 14.9 points and 8.6 rebounds per game and sharing conference player of the year honors with American University's Mark Nickens.1989-90 East Coast Conference Men's Basketball media guide In the offseason, Temple moved to the Atlantic 10 Conference and Casey was replaced by John Chaney. Hall appeared poised for another great year as a junior, averaging 20.6 points and 7.4 rebounds in the first five games of the year. However, he injured his knee in a game against William & Mary, had season-ending surgery and took a medical redshirt. After a season of rehabilitation, Hall returned for the 1983‚Äì84 season and teamed with future NBA guard Terence Stansbury to lead the Owls to a 26-5 record and an undefeated Atlantic 10 season. Hall averaged 16.9 points and 7.1 rebounds per game. With Stansbury departing, the primary scoring load fell to Hall in his senior season. He filled this role admirably, averaging 18.0 points and 8.5 rebounds per game.2010-11 Temple Owls men's basketball guide At the conclusion of the season, he was named Atlantic 10 Player of the Year, giving Hall the unusual distinction of being named player of the year in two different NCAA Division I conferences (through 2018‚Äì19, the only other players to do this are Sedric Webber and Doug McDermott). Granger Hall finished his Temple career as one of the most decorated Owls in men's basketball history. In addition to his two conference player of the year awards, Hall was a three-time honorable mention All-American, a three time first team All-Conference pick, and a three-time all Philadelphia Big 5 selection. He graduated as Temple's all-time leader in field goal percentage (since eclipsed), and free throw attempts. He was named to the Temple Athletic and Philadelphia Big 5 halls of fame. Professional career After graduation, Hall was selected in the fourth round (78th pick overall) of the 1985 NBA Draft by the Phoenix Suns.

It is based on the short story \\"Ghost Walker\\" by Ian MacKenzie Jeffers, who also co- wrote the screenplay with Carnahan. The story follows a number of oil-men stranded in Alaska after a plane crash, who must wage a war against a pack of timber wolves stalking them amidst mercilessly cold weather. Released in the United States on January 27, 2012, the film received praise for its philosophical themes, cinematography, sound effects and acting, while some of the dialogue and the film's ending were criticized; it grossed $81 million worldwide.  Plot  John Ottway (Liam Neeson) is a marksman for an oil company in Alaska, killing grey wolves that threaten the drillers. On his last day on the job, he sees a wolf pursuing a driller and shoots it, listening to the wolf‚Äôs final breath. That evening, Ottway writes a letter \\"without purpose\\" to his wife, Ana (Anne Openshaw), explaining his plans to commit suicide, but does not follow through. The next day, Ottway survives a plane crash with fellow oil workers, watching helplessly as Lewenden (James Badge Dale) dies of his injuries. Ottway takes charge of the survivors and is attacked by a wolf and rescued by the group; they realize they are in the wolves' territory and take turns keeping watch. Hernandez (Ben Bray) is killed by wolves, and Ottway suggests they leave the crash site, but Diaz (Frank Grillo) questions his leadership. While searching for the wallets of the dead to return to their families, Diaz finds an emergency wrist watch with a radio beacon. The group leaves the crash site, but Flannery (Joe Anderson) falls behind and is killed by wolves. A pack of wolves approaches and the survivors run for the trees, lighting a fire to ward off the animals and building makeshift weaponry. Diaz succumbs to stress and threatens Ottway with a knife but is quickly disarmed. Before he can apologize, he is attacked by a wolf, which the group manages to kill and roast for food. Ottway surmises the wolf was an omega sent by the alpha wolf to test the group. A crazed Diaz beheads the wolf‚Äôs corpse, throwing the severed head at the pack. Diaz tells the group of his atheism and Talget (Dermot Mulroney) states that he believes in God and lovingly talks about his daughter. Ottway says he is also an atheist, but wishes he could believe or have faith, and recites a simple poem written by his father. A blizzard approaches, and in the morning, Burke (Nonso Anozie), who had been suffering from hypoxia, is found dead. The remaining survivors travel to the edge of a canyon. Hendrick (Dallas Roberts) secures a line to a tree on the opposite side, and Diaz and Ottway traverse the canyon. Talget gets his foot caught on a hook, and the rope breaks away and he falls to the ground. Barely alive, he hallucinates a vision of his daughter, and is dragged away by wolves. Attempting to save Talget, Diaz falls from the tree and badly injures his knee. Diaz, Ottway, and Hendrick arrive at a river where Diaz, humbled by his journey and unable to walk, explains that he can accept dying in the middle of nature. Leaving Diaz to his fate, Ottway and Hendrick continue and are set upon by the wolves. Hendrick falls into the river and is trapped beneath the surface; Ottway is unable to pull him loose, and Hendrick drowns. Now alone, Ottway angrily appeals to God to \\"show him something real\\", but seeing nothing, decides he will ‚Äúdo it myself.‚Äù Exhausted and suffering from hypothermia, Ottway eventually stops walking and goes through the collected wallets before arranging them into a cross. He realizes too late that he has stumbled right into the wolves' den ‚Äì the team had been walking towards, not away from, the danger. Surrounded by the wolf pack and facing its leader, Ottway looks at his wife's photo in his wallet. It is revealed that she was dying of a terminal illness, the reason he was earlier preparing to kill himself. As the alpha wolf approaches, Ottway arms himself with a knife and shards of liquor bottles taped to his hand. He recites the words, \\"Once more into the fray. Into the last good fight I'll ever know. Live and die on this day. Live and die on this day.\\" He charges the alpha wolf. In a brief post-credits scene, the alpha wolf takes its last breaths, similar to the wolf Ottway shot and killed earlier. Ottway lies against the wolf, his fate unclear.  Cast  * Liam Neeson as John Ottway * Frank Grillo as John Diaz * Dermot Mulroney as Jerome Talget * Dallas Roberts as Pete Hendrick * Joe Anderson as Todd Flannery * Nonso Anozie as Jackson Burke * James Badge Dale as Luke Lewenden * Ben Hernandez Bray as Hernandez * Anne Openshaw as Ana Ottway  Production  The Grey reunited director Joe Carnahan with producers Ridley Scott and Tony Scott (credited as executive producer) as well as actor Liam Neeson, who collaborated on the 2010 action film The A-Team. The film initially imagined a much-younger lead character and Bradley Cooper, who also worked with Carnahan on The A-Team, was cast in the lead role, but he was eventually replaced by Neeson. Filming began in January 2011 and ended in March. The film was shot in forty days. Though set in Alaska, the film was shot in Vancouver and Smithers, British Columbia, with several scenes being shot at the Smithers Regional Airport. According to Empire magazine, in the climactic scene in which Neeson's character pens a letter to his wife, Carnahan urged Neeson to \\"channel his grief\\" over the death of his own wife, Natasha Richardson. Carnahan disclosed, in a Q&A; session following an early screening at the Aero Theatre in Santa Monica, that he had shot an alternative ending (that he'd never intended to use) showing Neeson battling the alpha wolf. It was supposed to be included in deleted cuts; however, no extras were included on the Blu-ray.  Release  The world premiere of The Grey took place on January 11, 2012, at the Regal Cinemas Theatre in Los Angeles. The film was released nationwide on January 27, 2012.\\"The Grey Gets A Release Date\\". ScreenRant.com. Retrieved September 29, 2011. = Marketing = Promotion for The Grey in part targeted Christian groups by issuing a \\"film companion\\", which highlighted the spiritual value of the film. Marketing also partnered with The Weather Network to highlight the hazardous filming conditions. Open Road Films incorporated comments tweeted by film critics to promote the film in the third trailer for The Grey. This was the first time tweets from and Twitter handles for professional critics had been used in a film trailer.  Music  The score for The Grey was released on CD February 14, 2012. A digital version available for download was released on January 24, 2012.  Reception  = Critical response = On Rotten Tomatoes, the film has an approval rating of 79% based on 207 reviews, with an average rating of 6.9/10. The site's critical consensus reads, \\"The Grey is an exciting tale of survival, populated with fleshed-out characters and a surprising philosophical agenda.\\" On Metacritic, the film has a weighted average score of 64 out of 100, based on 35 critics, indicating \\"generally favorable reviews\\". Audiences polled by CinemaScore gave the film an average grade of \\"B‚Äì\\" on an A+ to F scale. Roger Ebert gave the film 3 and a half stars out of 4, and wrote that the unrelenting harshness of The Grey so affected him that he departed the screening of a different movie on the same day: The film also earned a place on A.O. Scott's list of the year's ten best films, and Slate film critic Dana Stevens included it in her runners-up for the year's best movies. Film critic Richard Roeper also had The Grey in his top 10 best movies of 2012 list, placing it at number 3. Dissenters' reviews tend to focus on the film's abrupt ending and perceive the emotional and philosophical undertones as unnecessary. Siobhan Synnot of The Scotsman gave the film two stars, commenting that \\"On the down side, there's a lot of dull pretentious philosophizing about the heartlessness of nature and God. On the up side, you get to see a man punch a wolf in the face.\\" Some reviewers and analysts have described the film as having an atheist theme, due to characters such as John Ottway (Liam Neeson) pleading for divine help but not getting any. = Box office = The Grey opened in North America on January 27, 2012 in 3,185 theaters and grossed $19.7 million in its opening weekend, with an average of $6,174 per theater, finishing first. The film ultimately earned $51.6 million domestically, and $29.7 million internationally, for a total of $81.2 million, against its $25 million production budget.  Controversy  On January 19, 2012, British Columbia's The Province featured an article about the movie's crew buying four wolf carcasses from a local trapper, two for props for the film and two wolves for the cast to eat. This angered environmentalists and animal activists, who were already irate that the film depicts wolves in a negative light, specifically at a time when grey wolves had recently been removed from the Endangered Species Act in many western American states. In response to the portrayal of wolves in the film, groups including PETA and WildEarth Guardians started drives to boycott the film. Open Road responded by placing a fact sheet about the grey wolf on the film's official website, with cooperation from the Sierra Club. Carnahan responded by downplaying the significance of the violent wolves portrayed in the film, instead highlighting the significance of man's internal struggle for survival.  Awards  The film was nominated in 2012 for the International Wolf Center's Scat Award in Scare Tactics and Silly Information categories, being granted said distinction in 2013.

Early life Shackelford was born in Hancock County, Georgia, on September 26, 1786. He was one of ten children of John Shackelford (1736‚Äì1800), a soldier in the American Revolutionary War, and Frances Wade Butler (1736-unknown). He was a member of the large Roger Shackelford family that immigrated to Virginia before 1678. Edmund Shackelford married Rebecca Power Brodnax in 1814. The Shackelfords and Brodnaxes were pioneers of Georgia and Alabama. The couple had four children. Shackelford's home in Autauga County, Alabama, is now known as the community of Kingston, Alabama. Career Edmund Shackelford was a 2nd lieutenant in the War of 1812. He served in the Georgia militia from August 23, 1812, through March 6, 1814. He served in Captain William E. Adams' Company of Riflemen in Major William Alexander's Rifle Battalion. On September 19, 1813, he was promoted to Brigade Inspector. In Pickett's History of Alabama on page 559, Shackelford is called a brigadier general. However, his proper rank of lieutenant is reflected in a letter to sisters Ann and Frances, and it is believed the assignation of general is revisionist based upon his later career in the area's Indian conflicts. Shackelford served under General Andrew Jackson, later 7th President of the United States, at the Battle of New Orleans in January 1815. He continued serving with Jackson in the Indian wars in what was then America's frontier, now Alabama and Florida, including the Battle of Horseshoe Bend and the Battle of Pensacola. Shackelford moved to Alabama by 1828, by which time he was a general in the Alabama militia. From 1831 to 1837, he was Sheriff of Autauga County, Alabama. During the 1836 Indian Wars along the Chattahoochee River, he worked with Generals Winfield Scott and Thomas Jesup. Notably, when General Scott was recalled to Washington in 1836 due to controversies over his leadership during the 2nd Seminole War, General Shackelford was in charge until General Jesup arrived later in the year to assume command. In 1845, the year Andrew Jackson died, Shackelford wrote to him as a result of the continuing political controversies surrounding General Winfield Scott's removal from command. As Scott was soon to become the popular hero of the Mexican War, Shackelford's concerns seem justified: :General Andrew Jackson, Hermitage, Near Nashville, Tennessee. : :Nashville, Tennessee :May 30th 1845 : :General, : : You are no doubt aware of the charges made against me for several years :past of having by a course of intrigue obtained the Command of the Army in the :Creek War in 1828 and of having in the same way caused the removal of General Scott :from the command of that army, and also from the direction of affairs in Florida. : These charges I understand have been recently revived. To put them down :I have to appeal to you for a statement of facts as you know them to have existed :at the time, as well in regard to my being placed in Command, as to the removal of :General Scott after he had the command. I therefore respectfully request you to :state whether you did not, yourself, designate me for the Command of the Army :employed against the Creeks without consulting me, and without solicitation on my :part or that of my friends on my behalf. : Whether General Scott was removed by your order from the Command of that Army :as consequence of any influence used or attempted to be used by me, or in consequence :of his own acts, as admitted in his official reports, and which acts you disapproved, :and whether I had any agency in his removal from the direction of affairs in Florida. : I regret, General, this to be compelled to trouble you. With my personal affairs :in the present state of your health, but there is no other recourse left me for the :defense of my reputation against the reiterated of my enemies. : With the highest Consideration : And regards I am, : Your Obliged Servant, : /s/ General SHACKELFORD Shackelford died in Leon County, Florida. It is believed he was on one of his plantations there. The body was taken back home by a descendant, and he was buried in Old Town Cemetery, Autauga County, Alabama.

It is the integration of women into the global economies by improving their status and assisting in total development. Later, the Gender and development (GAD) approach proposed more emphasis on gender relations rather than seeing women's issues in isolation. Concepts In Africa, one of the first to recognise the importance of women in farming was Hermann Baumann in 1928, with his classic article The Division of Work According to African Hoe Culture. Kaberry published a much-quoted study of women in the Cameroon in 1952, and empirical data on male and female activities was documented in Nigerian Cocoa Farmers published in 1956 by Galletti, Baldwin and Dina. Ester Boserup's pioneering Women's Role in Economic Development brought greater attention to the importance of women's role in agricultural economies and the lack of alignment of development projects with this reality. In the preface to her book, Boserup wrote that \\"in the vast and ever-growing literature on economic development, reflections on the particular problems of women are few and far between\\". She showed that women often did more than half the agricultural work, in one case as much as 80%, and that they also played an important role in trade. In other countries, women were severely underemployed. According to the 1971 census in India, women constituted 48.2% of the population but only 13% of economic activity. Women were excluded from many types of formal job, so 94% of the female workforce was engaged in the unorganized sector employed in agriculture, agro-forestry, fishery, handicrafts and so on. With growing awareness of women's issues, in the 1970s development planners began to try to integrate women better into their projects to make them more productive. The WID approach initially accepted existing social structures in the recipient country and looked at how to better integrate women into existing development initiatives. The straightforward goal was to increase the productivity and earnings of women. Activities The United Nations Development Program (UNDP) established a special Division for Women in Development, promoting concrete action to ensure that women participate in UNDP projects. The United Nations paper International Development Strategy for the Third United Nations Development Decade, issued in 1980, recognized a number of Women in Development issues. It called for women to play an active role in all sectors and at all levels of the Program of Action adopted by the World Conference of the United Nations Decade for Women, both as agents and beneficiaries. Policies on industrialization, food and agriculture, science and technology and social development should all involve women sexing. A 1985 report by the OECD Development Center surveyed a broad sample of development projects aimed at women. It concluded that many were too welfare-oriented. It said \\"future projects should avoid the home economics approach and focus on income- generating activities which are relevant and useful to the women participating\\". It also noted the lack of information about women's roles and activities, and called for greater research as input to development projects. The Harvard Analytical Framework attempted to address these concerns. The framework has its origins in 1980 with a request to Harvard University for WID training from the World Bank. James Austin, who was well known for case-method training at Harvard, led a team with three women experienced in WID work: Catherine Overholt, Mary Anderson and Kathleen Cloud. These became known as the \\"Harvard Team\\". The framework was elaborated by the Harvard Institute for International Development in collaboration with the WID office of USAID, and was first described in 1984 by Catherine Overholt and others. It was one of the earliest of such frameworks. The starting point for the framework was the assumption that it makes economic sense for development aid projects to allocate resources to women as well as men, which will make development more efficient ‚Äì a position named the \\"efficiency approach\\". In November 1990 the leaders of the South Asian Association for Regional Cooperation (SAARC) countries endorsed recommendations of the second SAARC ministerial meeting of Women in Development held in June 1990, agreeing that the years 1991‚Äì2000 should be observed as the \\"SAARC Decade of the Girl Child\\". A wide range of recommendations for improving the development of female children were accepted. Criticism The validity of the basic assumptions of the WID approach have been criticized by some, while other consider that it does not go far enough. The latter group says it ignores the larger social processes that affect women's lives and their reproductive roles. The approach does not address the root causes of gender inequalities. The Gender and Development (GAD) approach in the 1980s attempted to redress the problem, using gender analysis to develop a broader view. The approach is more concerned with relationships, the way in which men and women participate in development processes, rather than strictly focusing on women's issues. In a 1988 paper Women in Development: Defining the Issues for the World Bank, Paul Collier argued that gender-neutral public policies may be inadequate, and gender- specific policies may be required to more effectively alleviate problems. In at least some countries, women have become increasingly involved in financial budgeting and management and since the 1995 Beijing Conference on Women there has been a surge in gender-responsive budgeting.

Background The earliest known observation of this effect came about in 1861 when Ernst MachMach, E. 1861 Ueber das Sehen von Lagen und Winkeln durch die Bewegung des Auges. Sitzungsberichte der Mathematisch-Naturwissenschaftlichen Classe der Kaiserlichen Akademie der Wissenschaften, Wien 43(2), 215-224 completed an experiment in which he set a line to make it appear parallel to an adjoining one, and found observers' errors to be least for horizontal and vertical orientations and largest for an inclination of 45 degrees. The effect can be demonstrated for many visual tasks and was named oblique effect in the widely cited article by Stuart Appelle.Appelle S. 1972 Perception and discrimination as function of stimulus orientation. Psychological Bulletin 78,266-278 The phenomenon Appearance of figure changes on 45 deg rotation Discrimination of length (top) and orientation (bottom) for a line at various orientations around the clock The effect is exhibited predominantly in tasks involving discrimination of the angle of tilt of patterns or contours. People are very good at detecting whether a picture is hung vertical, but are two- to fourfold worse for a 45-degree oblique contour, even when a comparison is available. However there is no oblique deficit in some other tasks, such as judgment of lengths. Similarly, while it is harder to judge the direction of motion when it is oblique, this is not the case for speed. The figure on the right shows the performance when an observer makes judgments about the length (top) and the orientation (bottom)of a line, in eight orientations around the clock. Even the immediate appearance of the form of a figure, often called gestalt, changes on a 45-degree rotation‚Äîthe geometrical congruity of the square and the diamond does not extend to their perception as figures (see left) as was emphasized by Ernst Mach. Origin of the oblique effect As with geometrical-optical illusions the oblique effect can be examined at two levels. The physiological one looks at the neural apparatus. Much pertinent information has been gathered here, yet the phenomenon was discovered in, and has ultimate relevance to, the whole organism's performance. Hence it is not contradictory to follow two separate tracks of explanation. = Physiological = Neural processing of contours was highlighted by the classical research by Hubel and Wiesel Hubel, D.H., & Wiesel, T.N. (1959). Receptive fields of single neurones in the cat's striate cortex. J. Physiol., 148, 574-591. which revealed neural units right at the entrance of visual signals into the brain that respond preferentially to lines and edges. When the distribution of preferred orientation of these units was examined, there were fewer in the oblique meridians than in the vertical and horizontal.Li B, Peterson MR, Freeman RD, (2003) Oblique effect: a neural basis in the visual cortex Journal of Neurophysiology 90, 204-217 Orientation differences also occur in testing the visual brain with probes for cell connectivity Li, W., & Gilbert, C.D.

Actually, many human fMRI studies have failed to see this biased activity in primary visual cortex.Freeman J, Brouwer GJ, Heeger DJ, Merriam EP (2011) Orientation decoding depends on maps, not columns. Journal of Neuroscience 31(13):4792-4804 Rather, more recent studies have suggested that, oblique effect may be due to selectivity for cardinal (i.e. horizontal and vertical) orientations in higher level visual areas and more specifically in parahippocampal place area (PPA),Nasr S, Tootell RBH (2012) A cardinal orientation bias in scene-selective visual cortex. Journal of Neuroscience 32(43):14921-6 an area devoted to scene perception.Epstein RA, Kanwisher N (1998) A cortical representation of the local visual environment. Nature 392:598‚Äì601 This finding is supported by the fact that, among all visual object categories, perception of scenes (both natural and man-made environments) receives more processing benefit from the oblique effect and higher visual acuity for horizontal and vertical contours, due to their unique structure.Torralba A, Oliva A (2003) Statistics of natural image categories. Network 14:391-412 = Empirical = Nevertheless, there is an oblique effect for target configurations that do not directly address these \\"oriented\\" neural elements early in the visual path into the brain.Westheimer, G. (2003). Meridional anisotropy in visual processing: implications for the neural site of the oblique effect. Vision Research, 43 (22), 2281-2289. Regardless of where in the brain of the human or animals an oblique effect is found, one would still like to know whether it is an inevitable consequence of the way neural signals are processed, or whether it is a minor error that nature hadn't been bothered to correct, or whether it fulfills a function in making us better in handling our visual environment. Proposing a \\"purpose\\" of the oblique effect, and developing scientific support for it is still a work in progress. A popular concept is that we live in a carpentered environment. Attempts at empirical explanations of perceptual visual phenomena have led to the examination of the orientation distribution of contours in the everyday visual world.Howe CQ, Purves D. (2005) Perceiving geometry : geometrical illusions explained by natural scene statistics Springer : New York Competing explanations have to contend with questions, not yet finalized, of innateness of horizontal/vertical superiority, of body symmetry in anatomical organization, of methodology of measurement, and particularly, of issues associated with perceptual development in infants and children, and across cultures.

Controversially, it illustrated how greedy Jesuit priests schemed, manipulated, and took advantage of Carmen, a young, naive, pious, and affluent heiress. The 191-page book was published in Manila by the Limbagan at Aklatan Ni I.R. Morales (Printing Press and Library of I.R. Morales) during the American period in Philippine history (1898‚Äì1946). Plot In the narrative, Jesuit priests used their religious authority and influence on Carmen to gain access to her wealth. Included in these plans and machinations was the destruction of the ongoing relationship between Carmen and Mr. Roland. Mr. Roland is Carmen's boyfriend. The priests succeeded. Carmen breaks up with Mr. Roland to enter the convent run by the Jesuit order. Thus, Carmen's inheritance became property of the priests. There was a scene when Eladio Resurreccion, a former cohort of the Jesuit priests, tried to set the convent on fire. However, Resurreccion's act of vengeance did not succeed. Only a stable for horses was ruined by the fire. Analysis According to literary critic Soledad Reyes, Sa Ngalan ng Diyos is a \\"passionate polemic\\" against Jesuit priests, an influential religious order representing the Roman Catholic Church, a powerful and authoritative institution in the Philippines. Reyes further explained that Aguilar's Sa Ngalan ng Diyos is unlike the \\"polemical writing\\" or \\"literature of caricatures and parodies\\" during the 19th century because the novel scrutinized the Jesuits, not the Dominicans, Franciscans, and Augustinians who are categorically known as \\"friars who owned vast wealth and property\\" during the period. Aguilar, through the novel, showed his anti-clerical view and his being against the religious order of the Jesuits because of the maltreatment and humiliation his father received from Nicolas Dolanto, a Jesuit priest. Furthermore, Aguilar's father was accused by Dolanto as being a \\"Mason\\". Aguilar's novel scrutinized the \\"insidious hold\\" that religion, in general, may have over people, in this case the Catholic Church over Carmen, the heiress. Aguilar tackled the \\"aspects of religious faith\\" that can damage the \\"state of mind of people\\". The 2005 edition of Aguilar's novel that was published by the Ateneo de Manila University Press (ADMU Press) has an introduction by literary critic Roberto A√±onuevo. In the introduction, A√±onuevo discussed an additional topic that Aguilar tackled in Sa Ngalan ng Diyos, namely the Katipunan of Philippine heroes Andres Bonifacio and Emilio Jacinto.

The riot broke out almost immediately after the conclusion of the Boston Bruins' win over the Vancouver Canucks in game seven of the Stanley Cup Finals, which won the Stanley Cup for Boston. At least 140 people were injured during the incident, including 1 critically. At least 4 people were stabbed, 9 police officers were injured, and 101 people were arrested. Four years after the riot, police finished their investigation and recommended the final charges against two suspects, bringing the total to 887 charges against 301 people. Background City organizers had set up a two-block long fan zone on six-lane Georgia Street near the Rogers Arena. Two big screen TVs were set up for fans to watch the game. Temporary fences and gates were set up to provide checkpoints where police could control access to the area and check for alcohol (which police generally poured out when found). Following recommendations stemming from the 1994 riot, all liquor stores in the area were closed earlier in the day. Crowds had been generally well-behaved in the fan zone for the previous six games, with roughly 70,000 attending each event. Similar though smaller events had been very successful during the 2010 Winter Olympics. For the final game, an estimated 100,000 people crowded into the area, and people found ways to enter the zone without being checked for alcohol. Planned corridors to allow movement of emergency vehicles became impassable. Violence frequently occurs in the wake of sporting events in North America and Europe. The 2011 Vancouver riot is consistent with past Stanley Cup riots in Canada. Since the 1980s, Vancouver itself had riots following the Canucks' defeat in 1994, while Edmonton Oilers fans set fires and looted in the Whyte Avenue (\\"Blue Mile\\") area of Edmonton when the team qualified for the 2006 finals, and Montreal was vandalized by Montreal Canadiens fans after both the 1986 and 1993 titles, and during the 2008 and 2010 playoffs. Riot car burns, surrounded by a large crowd On Wednesday, June 15, 2011, the riot began to take shape as the game came to a close at 7:45 p.m., with some spectators throwing bottles and other objects at the large screens in the viewing area. Boston Bruins flags and Canucks jerseys were set afire, and soon some rioters overturned a vehicle in front of the main post office. According to one eyewitness, a group who was heard chanting \\"Let's go riot, let's go riot\\" as early as the first period of the game were among those responsible for flipping the first car. Fist fights broke out when people standing on porta-potties fell when others tipped the porta-potties over. People began jumping on the car that had been first overturned; it was set afire at 7:46. With a crowd of onlookers chanting \\"burn the truck\\", a second vehicle in the same area was lit ablaze. Firemen were able to put it out, but the truck was again set afire after it was overturned. In a nearby parking lot, two Vancouver Police squad cars were later also set on fire. In total, 17 cars were burned, including police cars. Windows were smashed in a bank and various businesses along the West Georgia corridor, some of which were also looted. Riot police eventually managed to push the rioters away from Georgia, onto Granville Street and Robson Street, where the rioters then caused further substantial damage, breaking the windows of several shops and looting. Some of the stores affected were Future Shop, Sears and Chapters bookstore. One man was sent to hospital in critical condition after he attempted to jump from the Georgia Viaduct onto another platform and fell. Several hundred theatregoers were attempting to leave after a showing of the Broadway musical Wicked but were trapped and remained inside the Queen Elizabeth Theatre, which was situated in the riot zone. Transit authorities diverted or halted bus routes normally running through the affected area, and police closed bridge lanes into the city so that people could leave the area but further arrivals were restricted. By midnight, the majority of the crowd had dispersed. The Vancouver Police Department made 101 arrests during the riot. 85 people were arrested for breach of peace, eight for public intoxication and eight for breaking and entering, assault or theft. Aftermath A car overturned and set aflame on the street during the riot =Response= In the immediate aftermath, Vancouver Mayor Gregor Robertson initially attributed the situation to \\"a small group of troublemakers\\". Vancouver Police Department Chief Jim Chu said that instigators appeared to be some of the same individuals involved in a protest on the opening day of the 2010 Winter Olympics, and that they came equipped with eye protection, gasoline and other tools. He called them \\"criminals and anarchists\\" who disguised themselves as fans. The idea that anarchists were involved in the violence was rejected by UBC political science professor Glen Coulthard, and others in a Vancouver Sun article on June 24. \\"That this gets tagged as anarchist activity is just more of an assumption or bias that has been around for a long time,\\" said Coulthard. \\"[A]narchists are a convenient scapegoat for the police to deflect responsibility for what happened,\\" said another commentator.Law, Stephanie (June 24, 2011). Don't blame the anarchists, UBC professor says . Vancouver Sun. Retrieved on: July 4, 2011. One critic indicated that authorities had made several mistakes in the planning for the crowd‚Äîamong them allowing parked cars near the screens and leaving newspaper boxes nearby which could be used as projectiles. =Cleanup= After the riot, thousands of volunteers organized via texting and social media sites such as Facebook and Twitter to clean up the damage. The estimated 15,000 volunteers, many taking a day off work, stated that they went downtown to clean up the damage to \\"... show that not all Canucks fans are like that\\". Streets were reportedly clean by 10 am, with volunteers having shown up with brooms and dustpans to clean the city. Boarded up windows were covered in apologies and defences of the city's reputation. In response, the Hudson's Bay Company, a major retailer in the area, hosted a free pancake breakfast in thanks. =Criminal prosecution= As many as 70 officers from eight different police agencies formed the Integrated Riot Investigation Team, tasked with sifting through hundreds of hours of video and other evidence to identify rioters. Several participants in the riots turned themselves in to police after their faces were broadcast on TV, including the person responsible for setting the first car on fire. More than 1,000,000 photos and 1,200 ‚Äì 1,600 hours of video recorded by citizens were sent to the Vancouver Police Department as evidence. Insurance Corporation of British Columbia (ICBC) offered their facial- recognition software to the police in an attempt to aid in their criminal investigation of the riot. In 2012, the Information and Privacy Commissioner of British Columbia, Elizabeth Denham, ruled that police could not use the software without a warrant requesting the information. By July 2013, police had recommended 1,204 criminal charges against 352 suspected rioters. In July 2015, over four years after the riots, the last two suspects were charged. By then, a total of 887 criminal charges had been laid against 301 suspects, 274 of whom pled guilty. However police said they would continue to act on any tips they are provided and future charges could be laid. =Social media= Following the riot, people were initially concerned about the role that social media may have played in fueling the riot. Christopher Schneider, a sociologist from the University of British Columbia says that there is not a lot of evidence to support that theory. Also important to note is that it can be difficult to discern sarcasm from honest, real intentions online. Social media did, however, play a large role during and after the riot. Many participants in the riot stood and posed for photographs, with some even posting the photos on their own social media accounts. Photos and videos were also taken by onlookers intent on documenting the riot. In the aftermath, those photos and videos were used by many local people outraged by the riot, in an effort to tag and identify rioters and looters on Facebook, YouTube, and other social media sites, and to provide additional information to police for prosecution. Community participation in assisting police to identify the rioters has been described as unprecedented, and police admitted to being overwhelmed by the amount of evidence provided. While riot instigators were described by police as a small group of anarchists, the collected photographs and videos revealed that many participants were not connected and had never been arrested before. Online shaming campaigns resulted in some riot participants being fired from their jobs and removed from athletic teams. In some cases, violence was threatened against those identified as rioters, prompting one family to flee its home, and others to express concern about the potential of mob mentality online. The Vancouver Police Department appealed to citizens, online and otherwise, not to engage in acts of vigilante justice. A published study on social media vigilante justice, or \\"crowd-sourced policing\\", authored by sociologists Christopher Schneider and Daniel Trottier, concluded that online vigilantes can slow police investigations. An issue related to social media and the riot police investigation was that a number of people involved in the rioting were under the age of 18. Names of minors are banned in the legal system. On social media, however, the sharing of images and videos alongside public shaming online can end up identifying the accused. =Financial losses= CBC News reported that the destruction caused by the rioters was worse than the riot that followed the Canucks loss in Game 7 of the 1994 Stanley Cup Finals, particularly the looting aspects. Early estimates suggested the losses due to vandalism, theft, and damage to property to be nearly $4.2 million. Several large-scale stores such as London Drugs, The Bay, Sears Canada and Future Shop were among many that were looted. =Investigation= A report released September 1, 2011 says that contributing factors to the riot were the number of people who attended the event and the level of alcohol consumption. With 155,000 people in an area meant to hold the expected 50,000, the situation deteriorated into a riot with hot spots spread over a large area, and the police's ability to control it was impeded by communication problems and location of equipment. An independent review commissioned by the Province of British Columbia and the City of Vancouver released its 396-page report on August 31, 2011.  Media coverage  The \\"kissing couple\\" photograph by Richard Lam The riots sparked intense media coverage and attention on the local, national, and international level. Local media coverage of the riots began almost immediately after the game ended, with the local CBC, CTV and Global BC stations all running news coverage of the riots, with CTV and CBC doing so from studios located in downtown Vancouver itself. CBC News Network started running live coverage in conjunction with its nationally broadcast evening news show The National, with one reporter calling in her reports from inside the riot. Prominent publications such as The Atlantic, The Guardian, The New York Times and USA Today published editorials critical of the riots and its participants, as well as the city, noting the stark contrast between the Stanley Cup playoffs and the 2010 Winter Olympics. The Boston Herald provided coverage of the riots in addition to coverage of the Bruins' Stanley Cup celebrations, with other Boston media outlets providing their coverage of the riots. A photograph depicting a young female lying on her back in a riot-torn street between lines of police, being consoled by a young male who holds her in an embrace in an apparent kiss, became an iconic image of the riots. Sports Illustrated called it \\"the most compelling sports image of the year\\". At first, many viewers suspected the scene had been staged. Evidence soon revealed that the Canadian woman, Alexandra Thomas of Coquitlam, British Columbia, had been knocked down by police; her Australian boyfriend, Scott Jones from Perth, Western Australia, was comforting her. In June 2016, it was reported that Thomas and Jones live in Perth, Australia, where they sleep under a poster copy of the photograph. The photograph is used as the album cover of A Place for Us to Dream, a compilation album by the English alternative rock band Placebo.

Biography Born in New York City, Cawthorn started out in show business as a child, debuting at Robinson's Music Hall in New York in 1872. He appeared in minstrel shows and vaudeville as a \\"Dutch\\" comic, employing a thick German dialect. He later worked in British music halls and American touring companies. Cawthorn made his Broadway debut in 1895, 1897 or 1898, and embarked on a long career lasting over two decades. His first success was playing Boris in Victor Herbert's 1898 operetta The Fortune Teller. Other notable Broadway roles included the title character in Mother Goose (1903) and inventor Dr. Pill in the fantasy musical Little Nemo (1908). In the latter, he was called upon to ad lib to buy time during one performance. As \\"the scene called for him to describe imaginary animals he had hunted\\", he invented the \\"whiffenpoof\\" on the spot. Yale students in the audience appropriated it for the name of their glee club. When his Broadway stardom waned, Cawthorn moved to Hollywood in 1927 and started a second prolific career, appearing in over 50 films, the last in 1942. He played Gremio in the first sound adaptation of The Taming of the Shrew in 1929, starring Mary Pickford and Douglas Fairbanks; Schultz in Gold Diggers of 1935; and Florenz Ziegfeld's father in The Great Ziegfeld (1936). Cawthorn died peacefully on January 21, 1949, in Beverly Hills, California. He was survived by his wife, actress Queenie Vassar.

The term ‚ÄúSalish‚Äù originated in the modern era as an exonym created for linguistic research. Salish is an anglicization of S√©li≈°, the endonym for the Salish Tribes of the Flathead Reservation. The S√©li≈° were the easternmost Salish people and the first to have a diplomatic relationship with the United States so their name was applied broadly to all peoples speaking a related language.  Salish language  The Salish (or Salishan) people are in four major groups: Bella Coola (Nuxalk), Coast Salish, Interior Salish, and Tsamosan, who each speak one of the Salishan languages. The Tsamosan group is usually considered a subset of the broader Coast Salish peoples. Among the four major groups of the Salish people, there are twenty-three documented languages. At least five of these are no longer in use, while the rest of them are seriously endangered. The majority of fluent Salish-speakers are elderly, and younger speakers are quite rare. In spite of this, there are ongoing efforts to keep the languages alive through revitalization programs planned and conducted by various tribal organisations. Currently, a team of scholars is conducting research on the languages in order to create reference material and educational resources. Salish languages, especially those of the Coast peoples, are threatened primarily by assimilation. State programs such as the Canadian residential schools (where indigenous languages were prohibited) have been a major factor in reducing the number of fluent Salish speakers. Schools today, however, from the secondary to the university level, are actively promoting knowledge and use of the Salish languages.  Language and cultural revitalization  In 1988, the Self Governance Demonstration Project of the Confederated Salish and Kootenai Tribes (the CSKT) was successful, and the U.S. government returned full autonomy to their tribal leadership in 1993. Over the following decades the CSKT has reverted to traditional governance in which Elders provide counsel, to the chief, on tribal policies, culture and education, and in turn tribal policies have grown out of a desire to strengthen the community‚Äôs ties to their cultural heritage. In a move to self- identify and push back against the effects of the Indian Termination policy, namely assimilation, in 2016 the tribe chose to change their name from the anglicized ‚ÄúSalish-Prend d‚ÄôOreille‚Äù to S√©li≈°-QlÃìisp√©. The change was part of a wider movement to include more Salishan in the daily lives of the community. For the S√©li≈°-QlÃìisp√©, language and culture are entwined ‚Äî through oral histories, food practices, horticulture, environment, and spirituality. By reviving the language, they hope to also reclaim their identity, their health, and their culture. Community efforts to revitalize the Salishan language and culture, aside from efforts to teach classes on language (in some cases, full- immersion into the language with no falling back onto English), include such things as virtual tours and museums, such as the Sq'√©wlets, which is a St√≥:l≈ç- Coast Salish Community in the Fraser River Valley. There is also the People's Center Museum that opened in 1994 and hosts a rotating exhibition of Salish and Kootenai cultural artifacts. The museum is supplemented with an oral tradition of story-telling that explains the significance of the pieces on display and shares the stories of the people who lived in the time before and during the European invasion. There have also been calls for repatriation of artifacts across all indigenous tribes of the Americas as additional efforts to reclaim history and culture. Dancers at the 2012 Arlee Celebration = Powwows = The Arlee Espapqeyni Celebration is a yearly 4 July powwow hosted by the Confederated Salish and Kootenai Tribes and is located in Arlee, Montana. It runs for a period of several days and involves dance competitions and singing competitions (and non-competitive singing and drum performances). In 1884 the BIA (Bureau of Indian Affairs) made it illegal for any Indian dances to be performed, and so the tribes danced in secret. A new, religiously-influenced dance called the Ghost Dance began spreading from tribe to tribe at a rate that the U.S. government was wary of, and in 1890 a military unit was dispatched to Wounded Knee to interrupt a ceremony of the Ghost Dance among the Sioux. Roughly 200 Sioux were gunned down in what is now known as the Wounded Knee Massacre. Modern powwows came about after the armistice of World War 1, when Native American veterans returned home from war; celebrations were held for their homecoming and included traditional dances. A new sense of community also came into being with the end of the war, along with the proximity of reservations to one another, and the celebrations began to include neighboring tribes rather than remain exclusive to individual tribes. When Plains Indians were resettled in urban areas following World War II, per the policy of the U.S. government, their culture and traditions went with them and became widely spread‚Äîwhich is why many powwow dances and songs are from the Plains tradition. This dispersal of people and culture into large community centers also tightened the inter-tribal networks that had come into existence after the first World War. = Tours = Water People Tours offer historical and cultural tours specific to Kootenai life, and in-depth and personal insights from tour guides whom are themselves Kootenai‚Äîwho can pass on the tradition of oral history and significance of places to those who take the tours.  Art and material culture  = Salish weaving = Detail of a woven Salish cloak Salish weavers used both plant and animal fibers. Coast Salish peoples kept flocks of woolly dogs, bred for their wool, to shear and spin the fibers into yarn. The Coast Salish would also use mountain goat wool, waterfowl down, and various plant fibers including cedar bark, nettle fiber, milkweed and hemp. They would combine these materials in their weaving. A type of white clay was pounded into the fibers, possibly for the purpose of extracting oil from the wool. Not all Salish blankets were made with dog's wool‚Äîcommoners' blankets were usually made of plant fibers. The designs of Salish weavings commonly featured graphical patterns such as zig-zag, diamond shapes, squares, rectangles, V-shapes and chevrons. In the early to mid- nineteenth century, the fur trade brought Hudson's Bay blankets to the Pacific Northwest. The influx of these cheaper, machine-made blankets led to the decline of native wool blankets that were expensive and labor-intensive to produce. Salish weaving continued to a lesser extent, but the weavers largely transitioned to using sheep's wool yarn brought to the area by traders, as it was less costly than keeping the salmon-eating woolly dogs. There was a revival of Salish weaving in the 1960s, and the Salish Weavers Guild was formed in 1971. Objects made with cedar at Tulalip Tribes Hibulb Cultural Center = Use of cedar = Plentiful in the Pacific Northwest, the Western Red Cedar was a vital resource in Coast Salish peoples' lives. Canoes, longhouses, totem poles, baskets, mats, clothing, and more were all made using cedar. = Totem poles = Totem poles were less common in Coast Salish culture than with neighboring non-Salish Pacific Northwest Coast peoples such as the Haida, Tsimshian, Tlingit, and Kwakiutl tribes. It wasn‚Äôt until the twentieth century that the totem pole tradition was adopted by the northern Coast Salish peoples including the Cowichan, Comox, Pentlatch, Musqueam, and Lummi tribes. These tribes created fewer free-standing totem poles, but are known for carving house posts in the interior and exterior of longhouses.

Subgroups and territory  Pre-contact distribution of Salishan languages (in red) Salish people groups are subdivided by their respective branches of the Salishan language family: Coast Salish (peoples) speaking the Coast Salish languages, Interior Salish (peoples) speaking the Interior Salish languages, and the Nuxalk (Bella Coola) people speaking the Nuxalk language. The Nuxalk are the northernmost Salish peoples, located in and around Bella Coola, British Columbia. This area is separated from the main continuous land area known to be populated by Salish peoples.

The current Lombardy Romanesque Revival building was built in 1926 and has been listed as a Los Angeles Historic-Cultural Monument (1978) and on the National Register of Historic Places (2009). The church has been an important force in the Civil Rights Movement, hosting national conventions of the National Association for the Advancement of Colored Persons (\\"NAACP\\") in 1928, 1942, and 1949, and also serving as the site of important speeches by Martin Luther King, Jr., Malcolm X, and others. It is affiliated with the American Baptist Churches USA and the Progressive National Baptist Convention. Church building The Second Baptist Church occupies a Lombardy Romanesque Revival church structure located along 24th Street to the west of Central Avenue. The structure was built in 1926 at a total cost of approximately $175,000, including the land, building and furnishings. The structure was designed by African-American architect Paul R. Williams in collaboration with Norman Marsh. The church building opened in January 1926 with seating for more than 2,000 persons. The church's pastor at the time the church was built was Dr. Thomas L. Griffith, who served in that position from 1921 to 1941. According to a history of the church, the congregation's leaders acquired the property on which the current structure sits after hiring a real estate agent \\"who was very light in complexion.\\" The leaders were reportedly concerned that white property owners may not sell to an African-American organization and hoped that the white owners would be more inclined to sell to a light-skinned agent who appeared to be \\"a member of their racial group.\\" Historical significance Wed, 1885-05-13 On May 13, 1885, Second Baptist Church, the first African American Baptist Church in Southern California, was organized in Los Angeles. Second Baptist Church was born in the minds and hearts of early African-American Baptists in Los Angeles who felt the need to have their own church where the free expression of worship in the black idiom could flow uninhibited. Of the three persons who started the church only the name of the first pastor is remembered, Reverend S.C. Pierce. Rev. Pierce organized Second Baptist Church and ministered there for two years. The Second Baptist Church building was listed as a Los Angeles Historic-Cultural Monument in 1978 and on the National Register of Historic Places in 2009. The Central Avenue Corridor became the cultural and business hub of the African-American community in Los Angeles from the 1920s to the 1950s. The Second Baptist Church building, located one block west of Central Avenue at 24th Street, was deemed to satisfy the registration requirements set forth in the Multiple Property Submission for African-Americans in Los Angeles. Other sites listed pursuant to the same Multiple Property Submission include the Lincoln Theater (located one block east of the church on Central Avenue), the 27th Street Historic District (a well-preserved residential neighborhood located three blocks south of the church), the 28th Street YMCA (providing a swimming pool and other recreational activities in the years when the city's recreational facilities were racially segregated), the Prince Hall Masonic Temple, 52nd Place Historic District, and two historic all-black segregated fire stations (Fire Station No. 14 and Fire Station No. 30). Among the historic institutions along the Central Avenue Corridor, the Second Baptist Church played a particularly vital role in the Civil Rights Movement. With a seating capacity in excess of 2,000 persons, the church was the largest meeting space owned by the African-American community in the western United States in the era before World War II. The church hosted the national convention of the National Association for the Advancement of Colored People (NAACP) on three occasions‚Äî1928, 1942, and 1949. When the NAACP convention came to Second Baptist in 1928, it was the first time that the NAACP held its national convention in the western United States. Prominent speakers in the early years of the church included writer W. E. B. Du Bois and poet Alice Dunbar Nelson. The congregation was also active in campaigns against racial discrimination in housing, public beaches, swimming pools, and restaurants. In 1954, the congregation contributed $1,500 to the NAACP Legal Defense Fund to print the briefs used in the United States Supreme Court case, Brown v. Board of Education. The church also provided scholarship funds to enable future Nobel Peace Prize winner Ralph Bunche to attend the University of California, Los Angeles (UCLA). It was also \\"the West Coast 'home'\\" for Dr. Martin Luther King, Jr. who spoke at Second Baptist on many occasions from May 1956 to March 1968. Other noted persons to speak at Second Baptist include Malcolm X, who delivered an impassioned speech at the church in May 1962 after several Muslims were shot in a gun battle with police in front of the Muslim Temple, and Adam Clayton Powell, Jr. Changing demographics In recent decades, the demographics of the neighborhood surrounding Second Baptist Church has changed from an overwhelmingly African-American community to one that, as of 2007, was 40% African American and more than 50% Latino. The demographic change saw many of Second Baptist's members move to other areas of the city. However, the pastor, Rev. William Epps, opted to keep Second Baptist in the building it has occupied since 1926. Although the church remains predominantly African- American, the church's nursery school as of 2007 was 98% Latino. Second Baptist has also rented its sanctuary to Spanish-speaking Protestant congregations for services. Selected chronology The following is a list of some of the important speeches and other milestone events in the history of the Second Baptist Church. =1920s and 1930s= *January 3, 1926: At the dedication for the current church structure, the Rev. Adam Clayton Powell, Sr., pastor of Harlem's Abyssinian Baptist Church, delivered the sermon in which he called the building as the \\"most elaborate\\" Baptist church on the west coast. *February 29, 1926: A mass meeting was held at Second Baptist to launch a campaign to increase membership of the Los Angeles branch of the NAACP to 5,000 persons. *June 1928: The 19th annual conference of the NAACP was conducted at Second Baptist, the first time the NAACP conference had been held in the western United States. Persons attending the conference included W.E.B. Du Bois, James Weldon Johnson, and Arthur B. Spingarn. The Spingarn Medal was presented to author, Charles W. Chesnutt. *August 12, 1932: The Western Baptist Association of Southern California, an association of African- American Baptist churches, held its 40th annual convention at Second Baptist. A resolution was passed favoring existing prohibition laws and their enforcement but also commending a plank in the Republican platform allowing each state to change the law. =1940s and 1950s= *September 24, 1941: Republican National Chairman (and later Speaker of the House) Joe Martin spoke to the national convention of the Women's Political Study Club, which was held at Second Baptist. Martin urged African-Americans to vote for a Republican House of Representatives in 1942. He charged that the New Dealers' answer to every problem was a request for more money and power, and warned that the New Deal policies had led the country to the brink of bankruptcy. Martin added, \\"There can be no help from the New Deal. They have had their chance and failed.\\" *July 13‚Äì19, 1942: The 33rd annual conference of the NAACP was held at Second Baptist seven months after the United States entered World War II. Attendees included Walter White, Daisy Lampkin, Thurgood Marshall, and Roy Wilkins. California Governor Culbert Olson welcomed the delegates to Los Angeles in the opening address. The conference passed a resolution supporting the war effort, condemning Nazi racial principles, and acknowledging that \\"all civil rights are slated for destruction if Nazism is victorious.\\" Wendell Willkie, former Republican Presidential candidate, spoke at the NAACP convention, advocated an end to colonialism, and castigated white Americans for their attitude to African-Americans. Willkie noted, \\"The attitude of the white citizens of this country toward the Negroes has undeniably had some of the unlovely and tragic characteristics of an alien imperialism -- a smug racial superiority, a willingness to exploit an unprotected people.\\" He also declared that the \\"test of a people is their aim, not their color,\\" and noted that the shared aims in the ongoing war with Germany and Japan were beginning to break down \\"longstanding prejudices and barriers.\\" *July 1949: The annual conference of the NAACP was held at Second Baptist. Thurgood Marshall, then head of the NAACP's legal activities, reported on efforts to have all cases involving racial discrimination cleared through state and national offices for unified judgment. The delegates dispatched a telegraph to Pres. Harry S. Truman and Congressional leaders, calling for prompt action in passing civil rights legislation. Rayford Logan delivered a speech condemning the United Nations for failing to take action in support of the Universal Declaration of Human Rights, and pointed to civil rights violations in South Africa, Rhodesia, Italian Somaliland, Kenya, and the United States. *November 6, 1949: A. Philip Randolph, international president of the Brotherhood of Sleeping Car Porters, spoke at Second Baptist. Randolph criticized Paul Robeson for comments indicating that African-Americans could not be drawn into a war with the Soviet Union. Randolph charged that Communists had \\"split Negro leadership when unity is needed.\\" He accused Robeson of hobnobbing with Europeans rather than mingling with African-Americans and declared that the time had come for African-Americans to take a stand against Communism. Numerous picketers gathered outside the church as Randolph spoke, handing out flyers quoting Robeson's remarks and advertising a meeting celebrating the 32nd anniversary of the Russian Revolution. *January 1953: Second Baptist Church opened its membership to all races. The move followed a unanimous vote by the congregation. The pastor, Rev. J.

One speaker, Wendell Green, charged that Los Angeles policemen act \\"like a conquering army in an occupied country when dealing with Negroes.\\" Muslim leader Malcolm X also spoke at the meeting. In his comments, Malcolm X told the crowd: \\"They say we hate because we tell the truth. They say we inflame the Negro. The hell they've been catching for 400 years has inflamed them. We were brought here 400 years ago in chains. And it's been 400 years of undiluted hell. If we don't hate the white man, then you don't know what you're talking about.\\" The Los Angeles Times reported that Malcolm X's comments were met with a standing ovation, wild cheers, and thunderous applause. The pastor of Second Baptist, the Rev. J. Raymond Henderson, spoke after Malcolm X and criticized \\"the inflammatory speeches made today.\\" While agreeing there was a problem with police brutality, Rev. Henderson noted that the church had been loaned to the group on the understanding that it was to be a peaceful meeting and added, \\"We don't want it said that the Muslims ran this meeting. We are not in favor of hating anyone.\\" *January 19, 1964: Dr. Thomas Kilgore, Jr., was installed as the pastor at Second Baptist.

A youth chorus sang \\"I Have A Dream,\\" composed by Mrs. Esther Hines of the Second Baptist music department. A special collection was taken at the ceremony to raise funds to rebuild three Southern churches that had been burned.

He chided some in the group as publicity seekers, \\"Many of you got on the freedom train just in time to get on TV.\\" *November 1964: After FBI director J. Edgar Hoover called Dr. King a \\"notorious liar,\\" Dr. Thomas Kilgore, Jr., pastor of Second Baptist, called for Hoover to either apologize for his statements to submit his resignation. Rev.

Kennedy had been courageous in admitting he made a mistake after the Bay of Pigs fiasco, and continued, \\"It is time for somebody in Washington to say we made a mistake in Vietnam.\\" Dr. King also said that white racism was \\"still a glaring reality in our country,\\" and charged that the U.S. Congress, dominated by the rural South, \\"stands as a stubborn force in the way of social progress.\\" *April 5, 1968: African-American leaders gathered at Second Baptist in a show of unity following the assassination of Dr. King one day earlier. The gathering was attended by leaders including Augustus F. Hawkins, Tom Bradley, and Gordon Parks. There was \\"a roar of applause and cheers\\" from the crowd of 2,500 when a recording of one of Dr. King's speeches was played. The Los Angeles Times described the service: \\"Men in suits and women in Sunday dresses were outnumbered by youths, who wore berets, sweatshirts with portraits of Negro leaders and casual clothing. The mood of the meeting was constructive, rather than antagonistic. The meeting did not serve as a place to air blind bitterness against 'the honkie.'\\" *October 25, 1968: Rev. Ralph Abernathy, president of the Southern Christian Leadership Conference, led followers on a mule train from 103rd Street and Central Avenue to Second Baptist. Rev.

Yad Yisroel is an organisation with a goal to bring Russian Jews closer to their heritage. Since those early days, Yad Yisroel has developed and grown into a multi faceted organisation. Over these years, Yad Yisroel started communities and schools in Kiev, Lvov, Minsk, Pinsk and Cheminitski. Yad Yisroel has helped and influenced thousands of Jews throughout the former Soviet Union.'' Yad Yisroel in Pinsk Yad Yisroel, is a registered non-profit organization in the US, England, Israel and the former Soviet Union. Yad Yisroel is dedicated to the revival of Jewish life in the former Soviet Union, as well as assisting former Soviet Jewry wherever they may be. In April 1992, as an emissary of Stolin, Rabbi Yochonon Berman traveled to Pinsk to conduct the first Pesach Seder. In the year 2000, as per the suggestion of Rabbi Berman, Yad Yisroel allocated Moshe Fhima, as a trusted messenger to Pinsk. Moishe Fhima had been working for Yad Yisroel in Kiev at the Jewish Boarding School for many years, and the time had now come for him to start a Jewish Boarding School in Pinsk as well. Since the establishment of Yad Yisroel in Pinsk the town has been revolutionized. Yad Yisroel established inPinsk; two boarding schools, a yeshiva,a kosher store, a mikva, and Chesed aid for the elderly. These programs and projects are supporting Judaism throughout Belarus. Ten experienced shilichim have moved to Pinsk to work for Yad Yisroel. The strength and energy which is generated by the Pinsk Jewish community has a direct effect on every other community in the country. Education The schools, with dormitories on campus, provide both Jewish studies and secular studies, enabling the students to complete a general studies high school curriculum while pursuing their Jewish studies. Beis Aharon Boys' School Limudei Kodesh Entering its eighth year, the Beis Aharon Boys Boarding School has seen much success. Established with the mission of teaching Jewish boys about their heritage and helping them live a Jewish life, it hosts Rebbies from Russia, Israel and America who deliver daily classes from introductory level Judaism right up to Mishna and Gemara. The boys also learn how to daven, and hold minyonim three times a day. Education Beis Aharon provides an excellent secular education. Experienced, professional teachers teach the national curriculum and students have always maintained high grades. Full-time counselors, a doctor and a psychologist are on staff, catering to the needs of the students, many of whom come from broken homes or have troubled backgrounds. Beis Aharon Bielski Campus Beis Aharon Bielski School and Orphanage in Pinsk, Belarus The new 5070 square meter campus includes an educational wing, a residence and an orphanage, an auditorium, a kindergarten, and a recreational facility, to provide a warm, nurturing atmosphere for the children. A state-of-the-art kitchen and dining hall will supply hundreds of kosher meals daily to children, youth, adults and the elderly. An inspiring inauguration ceremony took place on Tuesday, October 28, 2014. The children and staff of Yad Yisroel awoke to a clear sunny day, the anticipation of a momentous event and the promise of a bright future. The Guest of Honor of the day was Aharon Bielski, the last living survivor of the esteemed Bielski brothers that saved over 1200 Jews from the Nazis, and his wife Henryka . It was a special honor and privilege to have Ruth Ehrreich, daughter of Tuvia Bielski who was leader of the Bielski Partisans, be with us at this dedication. Beis Aharon Girls' School Students of Beis Aharon Girls School celebrate Hanukkah (Pinsk,December 2015) Limudei Kodesh After twelve years, the Beis Aharon Girls School has acquired a reputation of being the pride of Belarus' Jewish Revival. Boasting a quality Kodesh and secular education, our school has produced the finest students that now learn in prominent seminaries in England, USA, Canada and Israel. Modern Campus One element that has greatly contributed to the schools success is the new, custom built campus. The school building is equipped for all the school's functions and needs - whether it be comfortable bedrooms, advanced science labs or laundry facilities. This enables the girls to feel at home and have a clear state of mind to focus on their studies. The Bais Aharon School building is a place always full of happiness and laughter. Family Atmosphere Another ingredient that has played a large part in our school is the family atmosphere. From the moment when the girls join the school, they begin to feel part of the Beis Aharon family. The girls in the school feel comfortable and happy - the school becomes a place they can call home. Even after they leave school, the girls keep in touch with each other and the families in Pinsk who have left them with warm feelings towards Bais Ahraon for life. Activities and Events Each year is filled with events and extra curricular programs. These give excitement and inspiration to the students. These events include Yomim Tovim, Camps, Trips, Concerts and national quizzes and competitions. There is rarely a dull moment in Beis Aharon! Outreach Yad Yisroel - a helping hand for Jews throughout Belarus. Although its focus is in Pinsk, where the schools are located, Jewish communities far and near benefit from Yad Yisroel's outreach efforts. Kehilla Work There are some elderly men in the Town who attend shacharis every morning. Bochurim from Yeshivas Pe'er Yisroel in Pinsk are allocated to visit them, taking along Tefillin and davening with them. This gives meaning and brightness to lonely elder men. Chesed The Jewish community also hosts some elderly Babushkas, some who still remember Pinsk being heavily chassidish. Often ill or lonely, these people are often visited by the girls school who lighten their load with singing or even just a caring conversation. Kashrus A kashrus campaign has been undertaken by some of the bochurim involving koshering kitchens, finding means and purchasing new ovens and constantly stocking the kitchens with kosher food. To this date five families and couples are under the program with more work on the hold for when funding is available. Yom Tov Yom Tov is a very special time in Pinsk. It is a time that the entire community gets involved in some way. On Chanukah and Purim concerts are arranged in which both the Beis Aharon Boys School and the Chesed group perform. On Yomim Tovim such as Rosh Hashanah, Succos, Pesach and Shevuos there is a special atmosphere in the Jewish community. Shabbatons Another programme Yad Yisroel offers to communities in Belarus is the much sought after Yeshivas Pe'er Yisroel Shabbaton. This has involved a group of bochurim going to a city for Shabbos. The bochurim then help with everything necessary for a true, uplifting Shabbos atmosphere including davening, leining, singing and even cooking. So far Minsk, Mogilov, Gomel, Bobroisk and Vitebsk have been the prime locations. Summer Camps A student's introduction to Yiddishkeit is usually at a summer camp. Yad Yisroel in Pinsk has organized action-packed, fun and educational summer camps. These camps both provide a sensational atmosphere for the students to relax from their studies as well as being an eye opener for new youth who want to see what we have to offer. To date these camps have been situated in Belarus with special trips to Russia, Ukraine, Poland and Lithuania. The girls camp has even been privileged with a camp in Italy.

Nichols House is a historic former residence in Bloomington, Indiana, United States. Built in a late variety of the Victorian style of architecture, it was constructed in 1900. Once the home of Bloomington's leading architect, it is no longer a residence, but it has been designated a historic site. History Born in Bloomington in 1859,Dodge, Dean. National Register of Historic Places Inventory/Nomination: J.L. Nichols House and Studio. National Park Service, 1984-03-01. John L. Nichols was the first architect to practice in the city, and the only one active in the city for much of his life. As a leading member of local society, he was commissioned to design many city buildings in the late nineteenth and early twentieth centuries; for example, he and his company produced over six hundred designs in 1908 alone. Many of the most prominent structures on Courthouse Square downtown are his work. However, he refused to limit himself to large-scale commercial construction: among his most prominent works is the Batman-Waldron House of 1895, which a local historic preservation survey has described as the city's \\"most eccentric mansion.\\"Indiana Historic Sites and Structures Inventory. City of Bloomington Interim Report. Bloomington: City of Bloomington, 2004-04. Smaller residences were also within his purview; in 1902, he published a complete book of residential designs, many of which combined elements from the Neoclassical, Queen Anne, Romanesque Revival, and Stick styles to produce a distinctive and popular style that local historians have called \\"Free Classic.\\" One of the buildings that Nichols held up as a leading example of his architectural ideals was the home that he designed for himself and his wife along College Avenue north of downtown. After building it in 1900, he made extensive use of it in his book as a demonstration of his theories of architecture. Nichols moved out of his new house just two years after its completion, but he maintained ownership until selling it in 1905 to the Indianapolis Southern Railroad, which at that time was engaged in the construction of a railroad line adjacent to the property. Except for twelve years as the home of a local railroad employee, the house was little used by the railroad. In 1940, the house was sold by the railroad, which had become subsumed into the Illinois Central; from this point to the present, it has been bought and sold by many different parties. Throughout the later twentieth century, the house gradually deteriorated, but by the 1980s it had been purchased by a new owner who began to restore the property to its original state. Architecture Living room with fireplace Characteristic of its designer, the Nichols House is a mix of architectural styles. Some of its elements are meant to recall the architecture of Ancient Greek temples, such as the Corinthian columns that support the roof of the entrance porch. A distinctive and unique design element is the stonework supporting the columns: rather than the dressed limestone that he used in many of his larger buildings, it is composed of small limestone geodes; almost no other Bloomington buildings employ these stones architecturally, even though they occur in large numbers in the city's vicinity. Other geodes were formerly used to support the chimney and as landscaping, although many of these have disappeared. The house itself features an unusual floor plan with vaguely elliptical ends: the west-facing front is linear, the east-facing rear encompasses an ell, and both the northern and southern ends are pentagonally shaped instead of flat. Just one story tall, the Nichols House is divided into five rooms with a basement; its frame structure is covered by clapboard siding. The cedar shingled roof has been replaced by one of fiberglass; both the original and the replacement were hipped except for the gabled roofs of the porch and the rear ell. Inside, oak and walnut panelling covers most of the walls, and the floors are made of cherry. Among the other original elements is the fireplace, which retains the hearth that it had at its original construction. The interior is lit by multiple large windows, a disproportionate number of which are located in the pentagonal ends of the building; although some are casements and others sash windows, all are divided into many small diamond shapes, following a pattern than Nichols employed in many of his designs. Related buildings Similar house in Prospect Hill Located just behind Nichols' house is his studio, a separate two-story building constructed in a manner similar to that of the house. It is a significantly simpler building than the house, featuring an open floor plan with simple and unadorned construction. In the past, the studio declined with the house, but it was ignored as the house was restored to its original state. Although not owned by Nichols, a residence similar to the present house is located along Rogers Street in the neighborhood of Prospect Hill. Situated near four other Nichols designs, this house is essentially a mirror image of Nichols' own home; both are clapboard buildings with central entryways and octagonal wings. Recognition In late 1984, the John L. Nichols house was listed on the National Register of Historic Places, qualifying both because of its distinctive historic architecture and because of its connection to Nichols. Although the National Register called the property the \\"J.L. Nichols House and Studio,\\" only the house itself was considered a contributing property. Like several other Nichols designs, the house has been given the status of Bloomington Historic Designation, and the 2004 City of Bloomington Interim Report, a historic preservation survey, deemed it the single most important part of the locally designated Illinois Central Railroad and North College Historic District. Today, the house is used as the office of a locally owned law firm.Contact Us , Terry L. English, n.d. Accessed 2011-06-15.
