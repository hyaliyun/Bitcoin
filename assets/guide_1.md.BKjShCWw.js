The groom's parents are seated. The bride is the one in the centre wearing a red dress and blue headpiece, presenting tea to her mother-in-law. The groom usually wears a sash forming an \\"X\\" in front of him. Sometimes the \\"X\\" includes a giant bow or flower, though not in this picture. Traditional Chinese marriage () is a ceremonial ritual within Chinese societies that involves a union between spouses, sometimes established by pre- arrangement between families. Within Chinese culture, romantic love and monogamy was the norm for most citizens. Etymology In more ancient writings for the word 婚姻, the former has the radical 昏 (pinyin: hūn, literally \\"dusk, nightfall, twilight, dark\\") beside the radical 女 (pinyin: nǚ, literally \\"a female\\"). This implies that the wedding ceremony is typically performed in the evening, which is deemed as a time of fortune. Similarly, 姻 (pinyin: yīn) has the same pronunciation as 因 (pinyin: yīn). According to Zhang Yi's (張揖) Guangya Shigu (廣雅•釋詁), a dictionary of ancient Chinese characters, 因 (pinyin: yīn) means \\"friendliness\\", \\"love\\" and \\"harmony\\", indicating the correct way of living for a married couple. Marriage in a Confucian context In Confucian thought, marriage is of grave significance to both families and society, as well as being important for the cultivation of virtue. Traditionally incest has been defined as marriage between people with the same surname. From the perspective of a Confucian family, marriage brings together families of different surnames and continues the family line of the paternal clan. This is generally why giving birth to a boy is preferred over a girl. Therefore, the benefits and demerits of any marriage are important to the entire family, not just the individual couples. Socially, the married couple is thought to be the basic unit of society. In Chinese history there have been many times when marriages have affected the country's political stability and international relations. During the Han Dynasty, the rulers of the powerful Xiongnu tribe demanded women from the imperial family. Many periods of Chinese history were dominated by the families of the wife or mother of the ruling emperor. Ancient Chinese marriages=Marriages in early societies In modern Chinese thinking, people in \\"primitive\\" societies did not marry, but had sexual relationships with one another indiscriminately. Such people were thought to live like animals, and they did not have the precise concept of motherhood, fatherhood, sibling, husband and wife, and gender, not to mention match-making and marriage ceremony. Part of the Confucian \\"civilizing mission\\" was to define what it meant to be a Father or a Husband, and to teach people to respect the proper relationship between family members and regulate sexual behavior. Mythological origin The story about the marriage of sister and brother Nüwa and Fu Xi told how they invented proper marriage procedures after marrying. At that time the world was unpopulated, so the siblings wanted to get married but, at the same time, they felt ashamed. So they went up to Kunlun Mountains and prayed to the heavens. They asked for permission for their marriage and said, \\"if you allow us to marry, please make the mist surround us.\\" The heavens gave permission to the couple, and promptly the peak was covered in mist. It is said that in order to hide her shyness, Nüwa covered her blushing face with a fan. Nowadays in some villages in China, the brides still follow the custom and use a fan to shield their faces. Historic marriage practices Marriage ceremony, Prosperous Suzhou by Xu Yang, 1759 Endogamy among different classes in China were practiced, the upper class like the Shi class married among themselves, while commoners married among themselves also, avoiding marriage with slaves and other ordinary people. This practice was enforced under the law. Maternal marriage and monogamy In a maternal marriage, a male would become a son-in-law who lived in the wife's home. This happened in the transformation of antithetic marriage into monogamy, which signified the decline of matriarchy and the growing dominance of patriarchy in ancient China. Marriage matters in Xinjiang (1880–1949) Even though Muslim women are forbidden to marry non-Muslims in Islamic law, from 1880–1949 it was frequently violated in Xinjiang since Chinese men married Muslim Turki (Uyghur) women, a reason suggested by foreigners that it was due to the women being poor, while the Turki women who married Chinese were labelled as whores by the Turki community, these marriages were illegitimate according to Islamic law but the women obtained benefits from marrying Chinese men since the Chinese defended them from Islamic authorities so the women were not subjected to the tax on prostitution and were able to save their income for themselves. Chinese men gave their Turki wives privileges which Turki men's wives did not have, since the wives of Chinese did not have to wear a veil and a Chinese man in Kashgar once beat a mullah who tried to force his Turki Kashgari wife to veil. The Turki women also benefited in that they were not subjected to any legal binding to their Chinese husbands so they could make their Chinese husbands provide them with as much their money as she wanted for her relatives and herself since otherwise the women could just leave, and the property of Chinese men was left to their Turki wives after they died. Turki women considered Turki men to be inferior husbands to Chinese and Hindus. Because they were viewed as \\"impure\\", Islamic cemeteries banned the Turki wives of Chinese men from being buried within them, the Turki women got around this problem by giving shrines donations and buying a grave in other towns. Besides Chinese men, other men such as Hindus, Armenians, Jews, Russians, and Badakhshanis intermarried with local Turki women. The local society accepted the Turki women and Chinese men's mixed offspring as their own people despite the marriages being in violation of Islamic law. Turki women also conducted temporary marriages with Chinese men such as Chinese soldiers temporarily stationed around them as soldiers for tours of duty, after which the Chinese men returned to their own cities, with the Chinese men selling their mixed daughters with the Turki women to his comrades, taking their sons with them if they could afford it but leaving them if they couldn't, and selling their temporary Turki wife to a comrade or leaving her behind.  Marriage during the Han Dynasty (202 BCE – 220 CE)  Marriages during this time included a number of mandatory steps, of which the most important of them was the presentation of betrothal gifts from the groom and his family to the bride and her family. The bride's family then countered with a dowry. Sometimes the bride's family would buy goods with the betrothal money. Using a betrothal gift for family financial needs rather than saving it for the bride was viewed as dishonorable because it appeared as though the bride has been sold. A marriage without a dowry or a betrothal gifts was also seen as dishonorable. The bride was seen as a concubine instead of a wife. Once all the goods were exchanged the bride was taken to the ancestral home of the groom. There she was expected to obey her husband and his living relatives. Women continued to belong to their husband's families even if they had passed. If the widow's birth family wanted her to marry again, they would often have to ransom her back from her deceased husband's family. If they had any children they stayed with his family.  Marriage brokers during the Ming Dynasty  In the Ming period, marriage was considered solemn and according to the law written in The Ming Code (Da Ming Lü), all commoners' marriages must follow the rules written in Duke Wen's Family Rules (Wen Gong Jia Li). The rules stated that \\"in order to arrange a marriage, an agent must come and deliver messages between the two families.\\" A marriage broker had the license to play important roles by arranging marriages between two families. Sometimes both families were influential and wealthy and the matchmaker bonded the two families into powerful households. Studies have shown that, \\"In the Ming and Qing dynasties, a number of noble families emerged in Jiaxing of Zhejiang, where marriage is the most important way to expand their clan strength.\\" Hence, marriage brokers were crucial during the Ming era, which offered us an insight of the lives of the Ming commoners. Instead of using the more gender general term \\"mei ren\\" (媒人), texts more frequently referred to marriage brokers as \\"mei po\\" (媒婆). Since \\"Po\\" (婆) translates to \\"grannies\\" in English, it suggests that elderly female characters dominated the \\"marriage market\\". Indeed, in the novel The Golden Lotus (Jing Ping Mei), the four matchmakers Wang, Xue, Wen, Feng were all elderly female characters. In ancient China, people believed that marriages belong to the \\"Yin\\" side (the opposite is \\"Yang\\"), which corresponds to females. In order to maintain the balance between Yin and Yang, women should not interfere with the Yang side and men should not interfere with the Yin side. Since breaking the balance may lead to disorder and misfortune, men were rarely seen in marriage arrangements. Furthermore, unmarried girls were not in the occupation because they themselves knew little about marriage and were not credible in arranging marriages. As a result, almost all marriage brokers in the literary work were presented as elderly females. Being a successful marriage broker required various special skills. Firstly, the broker must be very persuasive. The broker must persuade both sides of the marriage that the arrangement was impeccable, even though many times the arrangement was actually not perfect. In Feng Menglong's \\"Old Man Zhang Grows Melons and Marries Wennü\\" in the collection Stories Old and New (Gu Jin Xiao Shuo), he wrote about an eighty-year-old man who married an eighteen-year young girl. The marriage was arranged by two matchmakers, Zhang and Li. Given the age difference, the marriage seemed impossible, but the two brokers still managed to persuade the father of the girl to marry her to the old man. Feng Menglong described them as \\"Once they start to speak the match is successfully arranged, and when they open their mouths they only spoke about harmony.\\" The brokers gave powerful persuasions by avoiding about mentioning the differences between the couples they arranged. Which, only speak about the positive side. In addition to persuasion techniques, the brokers must possess great social skills. They needed to know a network of people so that when the time comes for marriage, they were able to seek the services of the brokers. Finally, when someone came to the broker, she must be able to pick out a matching suitors according to her knowledge of the local residents. Normally a perfect couple must have similar social status, economic status, and age. Sometimes they even need to travel to neighboring towns for a match, hence the verse \\"Traveling to the east household, traveling to the west household, their feet are always busy and their voices are always loud.\\" Furthermore, mediators are required to know some mathematics and simple characters in order to write the matrimonial contract. The contract included \\"the sum of the bride price, the identity and age of both partners, and the identity of the person who presided over the wedding ceremony, usually the parents or grandparents.\\" Without the knowledge of math and simple written characters, composing such a detailed contract would be impossible. The matchmakers made a living not only by facilitating successful marriage arrangements, but also by delivering messages between the two families. When they visited the households to deliver messages, the hosts usually provided them food and drinks to enjoy, hence the verse \\"Asking for a cup of tea, asking for a cup of alcohol, their faces are 3.3 inches thick (they are really cheeky).\\" However, these \\"visiting payments\\" were tiny compared to the payment they receive for a successful marriage. The visiting payment was always measured by \\"wen\\" or cash. Whereas, the final payment was measured by \\"liang\\" or taels, and one wen was equivalent to a thousand taels. Therefore, the brokers would spend most of their time travelling back and forth between the two households to persuade them of the marriage. In addition, the matchmakers receive payments for introducing young girls to wealthy men. In Zhang Dai's diary The Dream Collection of Taoan (Taoan Meng Yi), he described a scene in which matchmakers brought young beautiful girls to the houses of wealthy customers to choose. Even if the customer was not satisfied he would reward the matchmaker several hundreds wen. As marriage brokers, these grannies also possessed the \\"guilty knowledge\\" of secret affairs. In The Golden Lotus (Jing Ping Mei), the matchmaker Wang speculated that Ximen Qing was fond of the married woman Pan Jinlian, so she introduced Pan to Ximen, helped them to have an affair and hide the secret for them. According to the law married woman must be loyal to her husband, and anyone who discovered an affair of the woman should report her immediately. Although, the matchmakers were licensed to keep secrets about affairs because keeping privacy of their clients was their obligation. Even so, they were usually criticized for doing so. In The Golden Lotus Wang was blamed for egging ladies on having improper affairs. Traditional marriage rituals A modern wedding held in a Ming Dynasty format Chinese marriage became a custom between 402 and 221 BC. Despite China's long history and many different geographical areas, there are essentially six rituals, generally known as the three letters and six etiquettes (三書六禮). Unfortunately for some traditional families, the wife's mother cannot go to her son-in-law's family until one year (according to the Chinese lunar calendar or Chinese Lunar New Year) after the wedding has elapsed. However, during this one year the daughter can go back at any time. Six etiquettes The wedding ceremony consisted of six basic procedures: making a proposal of marriage (nacai), requesting the bride’s name and date of birth(wenming), sending news of divination results and betrothal gifts (naji), sending wedding presents to the bride’s house (nazheng), requesting the date of the wedding (qingqi), and fetching in the bride in person (qinying). The details of each ritual could vary. # Proposal: After an unmarried boy's parents found a potential daughter-in-law, they located a matchmaker whose job was to assuage the conflict of interests and general embarrassments when discussing the possibility of marriage on the part of two families largely unknown to each other. Marriages were chosen based upon the needs of reproduction and honor, as well as the need of the father and husband. # Birthdates: If the selected girl and her parents did not object to the proposal, the matchmaker would match the birthdates () in which suan ming (Chinese fortune telling) is used to predict the future of that couple- to-be. If the result of suan ming was good, they then would go to the next step, submitting bride price. # Bridewealth (betrothal gifts): At this point the bridegroom's family arranged for the matchmaker to present a bride price (betrothal gifts), including the betrothal letter, to the bride's family. # Wedding gifts: The groom's family would then send an elaborate array of food, cakes, and religious items to the bride's family. # Arranging the wedding: Before the wedding ceremony, two families would arrange a wedding day according to Chinese tung shing. Selecting an auspicious day to assure a good future for the couple is as important as avoiding what is believed to be an unlucky day. In some cases there may be no auspicious dates and the couple will have to review their potential date range. # Wedding ceremony: The final ritual would be the actual wedding ceremony where bride and groom become a married couple, which consists of many elaborate parts (see below): #* Wedding procession: Before the meeting party's arrival, the bride would be helped by a respectable old woman to tie up her hair with colorful cotton threads. She would wear a red skirt because the Chinese believed red symbolised happiness. When the party arrived, the bride must cry with her mother to symbolize her reluctance to leave home. She would then be led or carried by her elder brother to the sedan. From here, the wedding procession from the bride's home to the groom's home consists of a traditional band, the bride's sedan, the maids of honor's sedans (if there are maids of honor), and bride's dowry in the forms other than money. The most common dowries included scissors like two butterflies never separating, rulers indicating acres of fields, and vases for peace and wealth. #* Welcoming the bride: The wedding procession of the bride's family stops at the door of the groom's home. In the meeting party the groom would meet a series of difficulties intentionally set in his path. Only after coping with these could he pass to see his wife-to-be. #* Actual wedding ceremonies: On the arrival of the sedan at the wedding place, there would be music and firecrackers. The bride would be led along the red carpet in a festive atmosphere. The groom, also in a red gown, would kowtow three times to worship the heaven, parents and spouse. Equivalent to exchanging vows in the west, the couple would pay respect to the Jade Emperor, the patron family deities (or patron buddhas and bodhisattvas), paying respect to deceased ancestors, the bride and groom's parents and other elders, and paying respect to each other. Then, the new couple would go to their bridal chamber and guests would be treated to a feast. #* Wedding banquets In Chinese society, the wedding banquet is known as xǐ-jǐu (喜酒, lit. joyful wine), and is sometimes far more important than the actual wedding itself. There are ceremonies such as the bride presenting wines or tea to parents, spouse, and guests. In modern weddings, the bride generally picks red (following Chinese tradition) or white (more Western) for the wedding, but most will wear the red traditional garment for their formal wedding banquet. Traditionally, the groom is not responsible for the cost of the wedding invitation sweet treats (often pastries), the banquet invitations, and the wedding itself. Wedding banquets are elaborate and consist usually of 5–10 courses, with ingredients such as shark fin, abalone, lobster, squab, sea cucumber, swift nests or fish roe in soup or as decoration on top of a dish to symbolize fertility, and local delicacies. Traditionally, the father of the bride is responsible for the wedding banquet hosted on the bride's side and the alcohol consumed during both banquets. The wedding banquets are two separate banquets: the primary banquet is hosted once at the bride's side, the second banquet (smaller banquet) at the groom's side. While the wedding itself is often based on the couple's choices, the wedding banquets are a gesture of thanks and appreciation, to those that have raised the bride and groom (such as grandparents and uncles). It is also to ensure the relatives on each side meet the relatives on the other side. Thus out of respect for the elders, wedding banquets are usually done formally and traditionally, which the older generation is thought to be more comfortable with. On the night of the wedding day, there was a custom in some places for relatives or friends to banter the newlyweds. Though this seemed a little noisy, both of them dropped shyness and got familiar with each other. On the third day of the marriage, the new couple would go back to the bride's parents' home. They would be received with also a dinner party including relatives.

The album usually consists of many pictures of the bride and groom taken at various locations with many different outfits. In Singapore, these outfits often include wedding outfits belonging to different cultures, including Arab and Japanese wedding outfits. In contrast to Western wedding pictures, the Chinese wedding album will not contain pictures of the actual ceremony and wedding itself. In Mandarin Chinese, a mang nian \\"盲年“, or 'blind year', when there are no first days of spring, such as in year 2010, a Year of the Tiger, is considered an ominous time to marry or start a business.Jennifer 8. Lee, 'The New York Times', Sunday 8 January 2010 p. ST-15 (Sunday Styles) In the preceding year, there were two first days of spring. In recent years, Confucian wedding rituals have become popular among Chinese couples. In such ceremonies, which are a recent innovation with no historic antecedent, the bride and groom bow and pay respects to a large portrait of Confucius hanging in the banquet hall while wedding attendants and the couple themselves are dressed in traditional Chinese robes. Before the bride and groom enter the nuptial chambers, they exchange nuptial cups and perform ceremonial bows as follows: #first bow – Heaven and Earth #second bow – ancestors #third bow – parents #fourth bow – spouse Traditional divorce process In traditional Chinese society, there are three major ways to dissolve a marriage. The first one is no-fault divorce. According to the Tang Code, the legal code of the Tang Dynasty (618–907), a marriage may be dissolved due to personal incompatibility, provided that the husband writes a divorce note. The second way (義绝) is through state-mandated annulment of marriage. This applies when one spouse commits a serious crime (variously defined, usually more broadly for the wife) against the other or his/her clan. If the couple does not take the initiative to divorce when arose the situation of (義绝), the state will intervene to force them to divorce. If one side refused to divorce, the law must investigate the criminal liability of the party with a one-year prison sentence. Once a divorce is adjudged, they must not be reunited.崔蘭琴 (2008).《中国古代的义绝制度》載《法学研究》2008 年第5期，p.149-160, Retrieved from http://www.faxueyanjiu.com/ch/reader/create_pdf.aspx?file_no=20080512&year;_id=2008&quarter;_id=5&falg;=1 The third way of Chinese divorce process is mutual divorce (和離). It is a way that both husband and wife can have the power to divorce. However, It requires both of their agreement. In Chinese Marriage, this way of divorce is to ensure both husband and wife have the equal power to protect themselves, such as their property. It also enhanced the concept of responsibility in Chinese marriage. Divorce is a responsibility to each other. So, the country or the government won't intervene the divorce most of the time.易松国, 陈丽云, and 林昭寰. \\"中国传统离婚政策简析.\\" 深圳大学学报(人文社会科学版) 19.6 (2002): 39–44. Retrieved from http://www.faxueyanjiu.com/ch/reader/create_pdf.aspx?file_no=20080512&year;_id=2008&quarter;_id=5&falg;=1 Finally, the husband may unilaterally declare a divorce. To be legally recognized, it must be based on one of the following seven reasons (七出): * The wife lacks filial piety towards her parents-in-law (不順舅姑). This makes the parents-in-law potentially capable of breaking a marriage against both partners' wills. * She fails to bear a son (無子). * She is vulgar or lewd/adulterous (淫). * She is jealous (妒). This includes objecting to her husband taking an additional wife or concubine. * She has a vile disease (有惡疾). * She is gossipy (口多言). * She commits theft (竊盜). There are, however, three clearly defined exceptions (三不去), under which unilateral divorce is forbidden despite the presence of any of the seven aforementioned grounds: * She has no family to return to (有所取無所歸). * She had observed a full, three-year mourning for a parent-in-law (與更三年喪). * Her husband was poor when they married, and is now rich (前貧賤後富貴). The above law about unilateral divorce was in force from Tang Dynasty up to its final abolition in the Republic of China's Civil Code (Part IV) Section 5, passed in 1930.law.moj.gov.tw Divorce in contemporary China After the establishment of the People's Republic in 1949, the country's new Marriage Law also explicitly provided for lawful divorces. Women were permitted to divorce their husbands and many did, sparking resistance from rural males especially. Kay Ann Johnson reported that tens of thousands of women in north central China were killed for seeking divorces or committed suicide when blocked from doing so.Kay Ann Johnson, Women, the Family, and Peasant Revolution in China http://www.press.uchicago.edu/presssite/metadata.epl?mode=toc&bookkey;=76671 During the Mao era (1949–1976) divorce was rare, but in the reform era, it has become easier and more commonplace. A USC U.S.-China Institute article reports that the divorce rate in 2006 was about 1.4/1000 people, about twice what it was in 1990 and more than three times what it was in 1982. Still, the divorce rate in China is less than half what it is in the United States. One of the most important breakthroughs in the marriage institution were amendments added to the Marriage Law in 2001, which shortened the divorce-application procedure and added legitimate reasons for divorce, such as emphasizing the importance of faithfulness within a married couple, a response to rising failure of marriages due to unfaithful affairs during marriage that have come into public knowledge.Romantic Materialism (the development of the marriage institution and related norms in China), Thinking Chinese, October 2011 With the rising divorce rates nowadays, public discussions and governmental organs often criticize the lack of effort in marriage maintenance which many couples express. This is evident, for example in the new 'divorce buffer zones' established in the marriage registration offices in certain provinces, which is a room where the couples wait, as a stage within the divorce application procedure, and are encouraged to talk things over and consider giving their marriage another chance.江苏将推广设立离婚缓冲室 (Chinese), sina.com, May 23, 2011 However, such phenomena don't contradict the increasing permissiveness of the systems and of married couples which lead to the constant growth in divorce rates in China. Amendments have also been made to Article 32 of the revised 2001 Marriage Law. Parties to a marriage can apply for Divorce under, and by showing, the following grounds: * Bigamy or a married person cohabiting with a third party; * Domestic violence or maltreatment and desertion of one family member by another; * Bad habits of gambling or drug addiction that remain incorrigible despite repeated admonition; * Separation caused by incompatibility, which lasts two full years; * Any other circumstances causing alienation of mutual affection. Monogamy In ancient China, women's social status was not as good as men. A woman could only obey and rely on her husband. She shared her husband’s class, whether he was a peasant, merchant, or official; accordingly, the clothes she could wear and the etiquette. she was expected to display depended on her husband’s background and achievements. If her husband was dead, she could remarry but would be seen as not decent. The neo-Confucian opposition to widow remarriage was expressed in an oft- quoted aphorism of Zhu Xi: \\"It is a small matter to starve to death, but a large matter to lose one's virtue.\\" The virtues of chaste widowhood were extolled by instructions for women, such as the Nu Lun Yu (Analects for Women).While a man could have though only one wife but many concubines and marry someone else as new wife if the wife passed away before him. The general dignitaries also had only one wife but many concubines. Sororate marriage Sororate marriage is a custom in which a man marries his wife's sister(s). Later it is expanded to include her cousins or females from the same clan. The Chinese name is 妹媵 (妹=younger sister, 媵=co-bride/concubinage). It can happen at the same time as he marries the first wife, at a later time while the wife is still alive, or after she dies. This practice occurred frequently among the nobility of the Zhou Dynasty (1045 BC – 256 BC), with cases occurring at later times. Multiple wives with equal status * Emperors of some relatively minor dynasties are known to have multiple empresses. * Created by special circumstances. For example, during wartime a man may be separated from his wife and mistakenly believe that she had died. He remarries, and later the first wife is found to be alive. After they are reunited, both wives may be recognized. * Qianlong Emperor of Qing dynasty began to allow polygamy for the specific purpose of siring heirs for another branch of the family (see Levirate marriage). Called \\"multiple inheritance\\" (兼祧), if a man is the only son of his father 單傳, and his uncle has no son, then with mutual agreement he may marry an additional wife. A male child from this union becomes the uncle's grandson and heir. The process can be repeated for additional uncles. Beside the traditional desire for male children to carry on the family name, this allowance partially resolves a dilemma created by the emperor himself. He had recently banned all non-patrilineal forms of inheritance, while wanting to preserve the proper order in the Chinese kinship. Therefore, a couple without son cannot adopt one from within the extended family. They either have to adopt from outside (which was regarded by many as passing the family wealth to unrelated \\"outsiders\\"), or become heirless. The multiple inheritance marriages provided a way out when the husband's brother has a son.  Ruzhui marriage  The custom of ruzhui (入赘) applied when a relatively wealthy family had no male heirs, while a poorer family had multiple male children. Under these circumstances, a male from the poorer family, generally a younger sibling, will marry into the wealthier family in order to continue their family line. In a ruzhui (lit., 'the [man] becoming superfluous') marriage, the children will take on the surname of the wife. Concubinage In the family hierarchy, the principal wife (diqi) ranked second only to her husband, whereas a concubine was always inferior to the wife, even if her relations with the husband were more intimate. Women in concubinage (妾) were treated as inferior, and expected to be subservient to the wife (if there was one).Patrick Fuliang Shan, “Unveiling China’s Relinquished Marital Mode: A Study of Yuan Shikai’s Polygamous Household,” Frontiers of History in China, (Vol. 14, No. 2, July 2019), pp. 185–211; The women were not wedded in a whole formal ceremony, had less right in the relationship, and could be divorced arbitrarily. They generally came from lower social status or were bought as slaves. Women who had eloped may have also become concubines since a formal wedding requires her parents' participation. The number of concubines was sometime regulated, which differs according to the men's rank. In ancient China, men of higher social status often supported several concubines, and Chinese emperors almost always had dozens of, even hundreds of royal concubines. Polyandry Polyandry, the practice of one woman having multiple husbands, is traditionally considered by Han as immoral, prohibited by law, and uncommon in practice. However, historically there have been instances in which a man in poverty rents or pawns his wife temporarily. However amongst other Chinese ethnicities polyandry existed and exists, especially in mountainous areas. In a subsistence economy, when available land could not support more than one family, dividing it between surviving sons would eventually lead to a situation in which none would have the resources to survive; in such a situation a family would together marry a wife, who would be the wife of all the brothers in the family. Polyandry in certain Tibetan autonomous areas in modern China remains legal. This however only applies to the ethnic minority Tibetans of the region and not to other ethnic groups.

It was acquired by Pinnacle Entertainment in 2013. The company had eight properties in seven markets. History The roots of Ameristar Casinos date to 1954 when \\"Cactus Pete\\" Piersanti opened Cactus Petes Desert Lodge on U.S. Route 93 just south of the Idaho border in Elko County. The area would later become Jackpot, Nevada. In 1956, Piersanti and others incorporated the property as Cactus Petes, Inc. The corporation took over management of the neighboring Horseshu Club in 1964. Cactus Petes came under the partial control of Ray Neilsen of Twin Falls, Idaho, in 1967. Neilsen's construction company had built many of the structures at Cactus Pete's. Neilsen's son, Craig, assumed control of day-to-day operations upon the elder Neilsen's death in 1971. Craig H. Neilsen became sole owner in 1984. A November 1985 automobile accident left Craig H. Neilsen a quadriplegic, but he continued to lead the company and expanded it. Neilsen was named “Best Performing CEO” by the American Gaming Association in 2002, and was inducted into the organization’s “Hall of Fame” in 2005. Craig H. Neilsen remained chairman and CEO until his unexpected death on November 19, 2006. Ray H. Neilsen succeeded his father, serving as co-chairman with John Boushy, who also was promoted from president to CEO at the time of Craig’s death. Boushy resigned in June 2008 and was succeeded by Gordon Kanofsky, who previously served as the company's executive vice president, and now holds the dual role of CEO and vice chairman. Ray H. was named chairman at the same time.portfolio.com profile In August 2013, Pinnacle Entertainment bought Ameristar for $869 million plus $1.9 billion in assumed debt. The company had reportedly been \\"on the sales block\\" since Craig Neilsen's death. Expansion The Ameristar Resort Casino Spa, opened October 2009, in Black Hawk, Colorado In 1992 the company made its first investment outside of Jackpot by acquiring a Vicksburg, Mississippi, property known as Delta Pointe. This property was opened in 1994 as Ameristar Casino Vicksburg. The company subsequently constructed an adjoining hotel, and in 2008, completed a $100 million expansion of the facility.http://www.vicksburgpost.com/articles/2008/05/25/news/newsbus01.txt Ameristar opened the first of several riverboat casinos in Council Bluffs, Iowa, in 1996. In 1998, the company opened the Reserve Hotel Casino in Henderson, Nevada. The company was renamed Ameristar Casinos, Inc. and went public in 1993, on the NASDAQ Stock Exchange under the ticker symbol \\"ASCA.\\" Company headquarters was moved from Twin Falls to Las Vegas in 1996. In 2000, Ameristar purchased properties in Kansas City, Missouri, and St. Charles, Missouri, from Station Casinos, Inc., and in 2001, sold The Reserve Hotel and Casino to Station Casinos, which renamed it Fiesta Henderson. In 2004, Ameristar acquired the Mountain High Casino in Black Hawk, Colorado. In 2006, the Ameristar brand debuted after an $80 million renovation and expansion project that included additional covered parking; and announced details of its planned 33-story hotel and spa. Ameristar officially opened its new Casino Resort Spa complex October 2009 to become the first destination resort casino in Colorado. The property's $230 million expansion included a 33-story luxury hotel and day spa, an enclosed rooftop swimming pool and of meeting and event space. The 33-story hotel featuring 536 rooms and 64 suites became the tallest structure between Salt Lake City, Utah and Denver. Ameristar also completed the acquisition of the Resorts East Chicago casino in East Chicago, Indiana from Resorts International Holdings in 2007. It was rebranded Ameristar Casino Hotel East Chicago in June 2008. An outdoor summer concert series promoted the rebranding, and featured Lionel Richie, Smokey Robinson and Reba McEntire. In 2010, Ameristar announced plans to renovate all of Ameristar East Chicago's 280 superior guest rooms and 10 luxury suites; and to add 100 rooms and a fitness center to Ameristar Kansas City's existing luxury hotel. The addition will complement the property's existing 184 rooms and hotel lobby, which were extensively renovated in September 2006. In Massachusetts, where casinos were legalized in November 2011, Ameristar applied for the one gaming license allotted to Western Massachusetts, proposing to build a $910-million hotel and casino. It acquired a 41-acre site in East Springfield, a former Westinghouse plant, for $16 million. In November 2012, however, Ameristar withdrew its proposal in the face of competing bids from MGM Resorts International and Penn National Gaming, saying that city officials were more likely to endorse a downtown casino. In March 2012, Ameristar agreed to acquire Creative Casinos, developer of the proposed Mojito Pointe casino resort in Lake Charles, Louisiana, for $32.5 million. Ameristar planned to spend at least $500 million on the resort, and to open it in mid-2014. Philanthropy Following the death of Craig H. Neilsen, his estate endowed the foundation in his name. Ameristar regularly partners with the Craig H. Neilsen Foundation to support the rehabilitation of individuals suffering from spinal cord injuries and disease. Ray H. Neilsen serves as Chairman, and Co-Trustee with Kanofsky. In addition, Ameristar was one of the first companies to help fund research at the Nevada Cancer Institute by making a $500,000 donation in 2004. Ameristar also sponsors an active workplace giving campaign known as Ameristar Cares. In 2012, the company and its employees raised almost $7 million for charitable organizations. Financial Although the current economic recession has hurt the financial performance of casinos on the Las Vegas Strip, Ameristar and other regional casino operators have fared better, as customers opt for gaming and entertainment destinations closer to home. Ameristar's properties in Kansas City and St. Charles, Missouri, and Black Hawk, Colorado, benefitted from casino-related regulatory reform approved by voters in 2008-09. In Missouri, voters repealed the state’s loss limit, which had capped players’ purchases of table game chips and slot machine credits at $500 every two hours. In Black Hawk, voters approved a measure that increased betting limits and operating hours, and added the games of craps and roulette.

She first achieved notoriety in August 1964, when she attended the film premiere of London in the Raw, wearing a topless dress. Music and television career Jones began her show-business career as a cabaret artist in late 1950s London. She performed first at the Windmill Theatre, and later in clubs in Mayfair and elsewhere in London.

It is the seat of the Metropolitan Province of Louisville, which comprises the states of Kentucky and Tennessee. The cathedral church of the archdiocese is the Cathedral of the Assumption. History The Diocese began in 1808 when the Roman Catholic Diocese of Bardstown centered in Bardstown, Kentucky, which was then a thriving frontier settlement. It was established along with the dioceses of Boston, New York, and Philadelphia by Pope Pius VII, (1742–1823, served 1800–1823), out of the territory of the Diocese of Baltimore, the first Catholic diocese in the United States, which was first \\"erected\\" (established) in 1789 with the first bishop in the US, John Carroll, who was ordained/consecrated in Britain in 1790. Pope Benedict XVI's visit to the U.S. in April 2008 celebrated the 200th anniversary of the creation of these wider dioceses and the elevation of Baltimore to an archdiocese (known as \\"The Premier See\\"). When founded, the Bardstown Diocese included most of the new states of Kentucky, Tennessee, Missouri, Illinois, Indiana, Ohio, and Michigan—the western territories of America to the Mississippi River and the Louisiana Purchase of 1803. While Louisville is the oldest inland diocese in the United States, it is not the oldest west of the Appalachians. That distinction belongs to the Roman Catholic Archdiocese of New Orleans founded under Spanish rule in 1793, and which territory as part of the Louisiana Purchase became a part of the US in 1803, and Louisiana admitted as a state in 1812. Benedict Joseph Flaget was the first Bishop of Bardstown. The historic Basilica of Saint Joseph Proto-Cathedral, the former cathedral of the Diocese of Bardstown, is now a parish church, and a national historic site. While the French may have had initial influence in the formation of the Roman Catholic community in the Louisville area, eventually immigrants from Germany comprised the bulk of the Archdiocese's communicant strength later in the mid-19th century, particularly in the city of Louisville. However, much of the Catholic population in areas southeast of Louisville is of English extraction, consisting of descendants of recusants who originally settled in Maryland in colonial times. In 1841, the diocese was moved from Bardstown to Louisville, becoming the Diocese of Louisville. The Diocese of Louisville was elevated in 1937 to become the Archdiocese of Louisville, and the \\"metropolitan\\" (supervising) province for all the dioceses in Kentucky and Tennessee with an Archbishop of Louisville. There are currently three deaneries: Elizabethtown, Lebanon, and Bardstown. Statistics As of 2018, the archdiocese contains approximately 200,000 Catholics in 66,000 households, served by one hundred twenty-two parishes and missions. One half of all Catholics in the Commonwealth reside within the bounds of the Archdiocese of Louisville, and seventy-nine percent of all Catholics in the archdiocese (forty percent of all Catholics in the Commonwealth) reside in the Louisville Metro area. There are fifty-nine Catholic elementary and high schools serving more than 23,400 students. The archdiocese is home to one hundred sixty-six diocesan priests, one hundred twelve permanent deacons, fifty-two religious institute priests, seventy-seven religious brothers, and nine hundred forty-four religious sisters. The archdiocese serves more than 220,000 persons in Catholic hospitals, health care centers, homes for the aged, and specialized homes. Services, mother-infant care program, senior social services, and rural ministries services.

Instead the boy played NES games. Godin decided to create books that appealed to children who played video games. Godin, the head of a book packaging company, created the series idea, selected games to novelize, found writers for the books, and contacted the publisher for approval. Nintendo negotiated with Godin but negotiations failed. The other video game creators successfully negotiated and Scholastic Books approved the project. 1up.com described Godin's role in publishing as \\"similar to that of a movie producer in the film industry.\\"\\"8-Bit Lit: Behind the Worlds of Power. 1up.com. 2 .

Then he set to create one 40-page \\"bible\\" for each game outlining the plot, characters, and level layouts to assist the authors' creation of the dialog and narratives. 1up.com stated that assembling the bibles was \\"quite a challenge.\\" Godin and the authors played through the games without strategy guides in order to reverse- engineer the stories. All of the books were indexed by Godin's pen name; Godin said that he chose the pen name due to the way bookstores arrange books as children looking for books related Nintendo would see Godin's books indexed by the letters \\"n-i-n.\\" Godin said that his most serious frustration was playing video games for too long, as he would experience headaches. He added that the success of the Worlds of Power series outweighed the drawbacks; around one million copies of the books were sold. 1up.com added that this was \\"especially remarkable\\" as the target audience, young boys, were not considered to be a large market for book series. Godin said \\"We sold a million copies to kids that may not have read for fun before. That's a huge success (and) a home run!\\"\\"8-Bit Lit: Behind the Worlds of Power. 1up.com. 3 . Retrieved on November 22, 2008. One author, Peter Lerangis, used the pen name \\"A.L. Singer\\" and wrote the novelizations of Bases Loaded II: Second Season, Blaster Master, Infiltrator, and Ninja Gaiden. Godin approached Lerangis when the project began and asked Lerangis to be a writer for the project. Lerangis, who admitted a lack of skill in playing video games, took the offer. Lerangis wrote each book in about four weeks. One of Lerangis's two favorite books, Ninja Gaiden, was one of the most popular books in the Worlds of Power series. He liked writing the book since he \\"was able to get into the character's head pretty quickly,\\" especially while writing the beginning. Lerangis said that the book reveals Ryu's father to be alive at the end since he and Godin believed that the revised ending was consistent with the Worlds of Power character and as real-life fathers they felt reluctance to leave Ryu without a father. Bases Loaded II: Second Season , Lerangis's other favorite title, is considered to be more obscure. Lerangis liked baseball and, since the game had no plot, he created an original light comedy storyline; Lerangis said that Bases Loaded was the most fun book to write. Lerangis described Blaster Master as the most difficult book to write; since the game does not have a strong middle plot, Lerangis fleshed the story connected the beginning and ending of the games. Godin said that he would have liked to novelize the game Myst, a personal computer game, into a book. He said that \\"I think that stories never go out of style. I think we need a series like this now more than ever & kids need to learn the habit of reading\\" and that \\"I think the lesson of each book was that there is a hero in everyone. You just have to set it free.\\" Editing of video game stories The Worlds of Power series omitted violent elements in the video games. Video game covers were adapted into the book covers after weaponry was omitted. For instance in Ninja Gaiden's cover, the dagger that Ryu Hayabusa held in front of him is no longer visible. In Metal Gear's cover, Solid Snake no longer holds his gun; 1up.com's Scott Sharkey said that without the gun, Snake was \\"making a vaguely masturbatory gesture.\\" Within the texts, death and violence were not inflicted on humans and animals. In the Blaster Master book, the bosses appearing like mutated animals are holographic projections placed on formless blobs. In the Metal Gear book, Snake—described as a \\"walking arsenal\\"—uses his guns only to pistol whip enemieshttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zbtO4EasHLE. In the Ninja Gaiden book, Ryu Hayabusa's father—seemingly killed in the prologue of the game and said to be dead in earlier book chapters—is revealed as alive by the end of the book. In the Infiltrator book, an agent scheduled to be \\"voided\\" either has his memory wiped clean, receives exiling, or receives a demotion. In Bionic Commando, the protagonist's gun shoots \\"stun bullets\\" and the protagonist uses karate chops to disable enemies. Towards the end of that book, a clone of Adolf Hitler kills the enemy leader; the protagonist feels no sympathy since the leader was, as stated by 1up.com, \\"an evil man being eliminated by an even more evil man.\\" In addition, overtly magical and occult references were omitted from the Before Shadowgate book. Godin described the editing as \\"stylistic in nature\\" and that he intended to \\"minimize the death\\" in the adapted games. He added that Scholastic asked him to remove witchcraft several years before the release of Harry Potter's first book, Harry Potter and the Sorcerer's Stone (Harry Potter and the Philosopher's Stone in the United Kingdom), which was published by Scholastic in the United States. Legacy The PlayStation game Blaster Master: Blasting Again, a sequel to the original Blaster Master, canonized some of the original elements from Peter Lerangis' novelization of Blaster Master. Particularly the character Eve, who was not in the NES game, appeared in Blasting Again. Lerangis stated that he felt \\"honored\\" for the privilege.

The music is strongly inspired by mid-1980s R&B; and funk, with heavy use of synthesizers, sequencers and drum machines. As indicated in the notes accompanying the album, Tutu was produced by Tommy LiPuma and Marcus Miller, with the exception of \\"Backyard Ritual\\", which was co-produced by Duke and LiPuma. The cover was designed by Eiko Ishioka and photographed by Irving Penn. Eiko Ishioka received the 1987 Grammy Award for Best Album Package for her work as the art director. The original vinyl album featured a colored inner sleeve printed with the album credits on one side and a photograph of Davis's left hand (with middle finger depressed) on the reverse.  Reception and legacy  Tutu divided critics and listeners when it was released in 1986. Like Davis's pivotal 1970 album Bitches Brew, Paul Tingen wrote, Tutu became one of the \\"defining jazz albums\\" of its decade and attracted a young, new audience while alienating many other jazz listeners because of its heavy reliance on the drum machine and synthesizers. A number of critics felt the music was ingratiatingly elegant, designed for casual listening, and largely a work by Miller. In The New York Times that year, Robert Palmer said it \\"already sounds curiously dated\\" and unambitious, featuring synthesizers that \\"have glutinous textures so overly familiar from the mainstream of late-1970s pop jazz\\" and electronic rhythms lacking the innovation of contemporary hip hop records. Others believed the album gave a musical setting for Davis's improvisations to thrive in, comparable to his orchestral recordings with Gil Evans from the late 1950s and early 1960s. The Village Voice critic Robert Christgau deemed it a marginal success but also Davis's \\"best in a decade\\". He contended that while Davis's 1970s fusion recordings for Columbia Records were purely improvised jazz-rock, Tutu sounded \\"more like pop-funk Sketches of Spain, with the starperson's trumpet glancing smartly off an up-to-date panoply of catchy little tunes, beats, and rhythm effects\\". Jazz musician and writer Mike Zwerin was more enthusiastic, hailing it as \\"the best jazz record of the decade\\". In a retrospective piece, Christgau later wrote that with \\"shlock\\" like Tutu and Amandla, Davis was taking advantage of the fusion movement he helped develop while showing \\"gratifying groove and class\\". In J. D. Considine's opinion, the album's compositions and improvisations endured well with the passage of time, even though its electronically processed and enigmatic music turned off jazz purists. Writing for Something Else! in 2006, S. Victor Aaron said the best song from Tutu may have been Davis's own composition \\"Tomaas\\": \\"With a reggae beat married to repetitive single note underpinned by some very nifty bass work by Miller, Miles and Miller (also on soprano sax) trade fours and eights in a rare opportunity for Miles to stretch out. Overall, though, the trumpet playing is subdued, probably more constrained by production than declining abilities. Rarely does the mute come off his horn.\\" Reviewing the album for Jazzwise in 2011, Davis' biographer George Cole said, \\"Tutu was a product of the 80s, a decade where music was often in danger of becoming subservient to technology. But while much of the music from this era is now long forgotten; Tutu continues to thrive; artists such as George Benson, Al Jarreau and Cassandra Wilson have recorded cover versions of the title track.\\" Between May and August 2010, Miller performed on the \\"Tutu Revisited\\" concert tour with a band comprising Christian Scott on trumpet with Alex Han on saxophone, Federico González Peña on keyboards and Louis Cato on drums. In an interview for JazzTimes, Miller said, \\"I'm finding that although the music mirrored the times in which it was created, there is so much in the music that still seems relevant today. Although we've replaced some of the super electro sounding elements, the melodies are still very cool. It feels like they have withstood the test of time. People seem to be feeling this music twenty years later.\\" Track listing All tracks composed by Marcus Miller except where indicated: #\\"Tutu\\" – 5:15 #\\"Tomaas\\" – 5:38 (Davis, Marcus Miller) #\\"Portia\\" – 6:18 #\\"Splatch\\" – 4:46 #\\"Backyard Ritual\\" – 4:49 (George Duke) #\\"Perfect Way\\" – 4:35 (David Gamson, Green Gartside) #\\"Don't Lose Your Mind\\" – 5:49 #\\"Full Nelson\\" – 5:06  Deluxe edition  Disc two (Live from Nice Festival, France, July 1986) #\\"Opening Medley\\": 'Theme from Jack Johnson', 'Speak', 'That's What Happened' – 15:14 #\\"New Blues\\" – 5:20 #\\"The Maze\\" – 10:15 #\\"Human Nature\\" – 9:04 #\\"Portia\\" – 7:54 #\\"Splatch\\" – 17:10 #\\"Time After Time\\" – 7:22 #\\"Carnival\\" – 4:20 Personnel=Musicians * Miles Davis – trumpet * Marcus Miller – bass guitars, guitar, synthesizers, drum machine programming, bass clarinet, soprano saxophone, other instruments * Jason Miles – synthesizer programming * Paulinho da Costa – percussion on \\"Tutu\\", \\"Portia\\", \\"Splatch\\" and Backyard Ritual\\" * Adam Holzman – synthesizer solo on \\"Splatch\\" * Steve Reid – additional percussion on \\"Splatch\\" * George Duke – all except percussion, bass guitar, trumpet on \\"Backyard Ritual\\" * Omar Hakim – drums and percussion on \\"Tomaas\\" * Bernard Wright – additional synthesizers on \\"Tomaas\\" and \\"Don't Lose Your Mind\\" * Michał Urbaniak – electric violin on \\"Don't Lose Your Mind\\" * Jabali Billy Hart – drums, bongos Production *Producers – Tommy LiPuma and Marcus Miller *Musical arrangements – Marcus Miller *Producers (5) – Tommy LiPuma and George Duke *Musical arrangement (5) – George Duke *Executive producer – Tommy LiPuma *Engineers – Peter Doell and Eric Calvi *Assistant engineer – Maureen Thompson *Engineer (5) – Erik Zobler *Assistant engineer (5) – Mitch Gibson *Photographer – Irving Penn *Art director – Eiko Ishioka *Designer – Susan Welt Certifications and salesReferences Bibliography    Further reading  *  External links  * Category:1986 albums Category:Miles Davis albums Category:Albums produced by Tommy LiPuma Category:Albums produced by Marcus Miller Category:Jazz fusion albums by American artists Category:Jazz-funk albums Category:Warner Records albums Category:Albums recorded at Capitol Studios ","title":"Tutu (album)"},{"id":"1889197","text":"Napalm and Silly Putty is a 2001 book by comedian George Carlin.January Magazine Background This book contains much of Carlin's stand-up comedy material.

It is a method used by hydrogeologists and civil engineers to determine the transmissivity/hydraulic conductivity and storativity of the material the well is completed in. Slug test method The slug of water can either be added to or removed from the well -- the only requirement is that it be done as quickly as possible (the interpretation typically assumes instantaneously), then the water level or pressure is monitored. Depending on the properties of the aquifer and the size of the slug, the water level may return to pre-test levels very quickly (thus complicating accurate collection of water level data). A slug can be added by either quickly adding a measured amount of water to the well or something which displaces a measured volume (e.g., a long heavy pipe with the ends capped off). An alternative object is a solid polyvinyl chloride (PVC) rod, with sufficient weight to sink into the groundwater. The objective here is to displace water, not merely be \\"heavy\\". A slug of water can be removed using a bailer or pump, but this is more difficult to do since it must be done very quickly and the equipment for removing the water (pump or bailer) will likely be in the way of getting water level measurements. Performing a slug test A slug test is in contrast to standard aquifer tests, which typically involve pumping a well at a constant flowrate, and monitoring the response of the aquifer in nearby monitoring wells. Often slug tests are performed instead of a constant rate test, because: *time constraints (quick results, or results for a large number of wells, are needed), *the well does not or cannot have a pump installed on it (slug tests do not require pumping), *the transmissivity of the material the well is cased in is too low to realistically perform a proper pumping test (common for aquitards or some bedrock monitoring wells), or *the general size (order of magnitude) of the aquifer parameters is all the accuracy that is required. The size of the slug required is determined by the aquifer properties, the size of the well and the amount of time which is available for the test. For very permeable aquifers, the pulse will dissipate very quickly. If the well has a large diameter, a large volume of water must be added to increase the level in the well a measurable amount. Slug test interpretation Because the flow rate into or out of the well is not constant, as is the case in a typical aquifer test, the standard Theis solution does not work. Mathematically, the Theis equation is the solution of the groundwater flow equation for a step increase in discharge rate at the pumping well; a slug test is instead an instantaneous pulse at the pumping well. This means that a superposition (or more precisely a convolution) of an infinite number of sequential slug tests through time would effectively be a \\"standard\\" Theis aquifer test. There are several known solutions to the slug test problem; a common engineering approximation is the Hvorslev method, which approximates the more rigorous solution to transient aquifer flow with a simple decaying exponential function. The aquifer parameters obtained from a slug test are typically less representative of the aquifer surrounding the well than an aquifer test which involves pumping in one well and monitoring in another. Complications arise from near-well effects (i.e., well skin and wellbore storage), which may make it difficult to get accurate results from slug test interpretation.

He is a member of the Dominica Labour Party and served for a time as Minister for National Security, Immigration, Labour and the Public Service.  Political life  Following the demise of the Patrick John government (in which Savarin played an integral role), Savarin was made Chairman of the Committee for National Salvation (CNS). This body comprising members of the greater cross section of Dominican Society, was tasked with overseeing the transition to an interim government. Savarin contested the 1980 General Elections on a Dominica Freedom Party ticket losing to Mike Douglas in a four-way race. Savarin polled 405 votes to Douglas's 531 votes. In 1983, Savarin was appointed as Minister without Portfolio in the Prime Minister's Office with special responsibility for Trade, Industry and Tourism. In 1986, Savarin was appointed Ambassador/Permanent Representative to the European Union. He also served as principal ambassadorial spokesman for African/Caribbean/Pacific States on bananas. That assignment ended in 1993, when he returned to Dominica to become General Manager of the National Development Corporation (NDC). When Dame Eugenia Charles decided to walk away from politics, Savarin contested the Leadership of the Dominica Freedom Party losing to Brian Alleyne. He however replaced Dame Eugenia as the party's flag bearer in the Roseau Central Constituency. Savarin emerged victorious at the polls with some 1013 votes to Norris Prevo's 759. When Brian Alleyne resigned as DFP Leader and Leader of the Opposition in 1996, Savarin again entered the leadership race. On 20 April 1996, Savarin received 86 out of 107 votes at the party's General Council. He served as Leader of the DFP until 2007 where mounting criticism of his leadership forced him to resign. During his first term as Roseau Central MP Savarin championed the cause of \\"equal educational opportunities\\" for children in the Roseau catchment area. He was again re-elected as MP for Roseau in the 2000 General elections this time by a much reduced margin. Savarin entered into a coalition arrangement with the Roosie Douglas-led Dominica Labour Party. He was appointed Minister for Tourism. After Douglas died some eight months later, Pierre Charles was appointed Prime Minister. He added the responsibilities of Enterprise Development and The Public Service to Savarin's portfolio. Savarin was one of the most vocal defenders of the Pierre Charles government, often acting for Charles when the later was overseas. He was also Chairman of the cabinet sub-committee on the economy. This placed him in the forefront of discussions and negotiations with the International Monetary Fund and other donor agencies. Savarin was also one of the main speakers at town hall style meetings of the government to inform the public on the serious difficulties facing the economy. In 2003 as acting Prime Minister Savarin announced the plans by a foreign company to build a billion dollar oil refinery in Castle Bruce Dominica. However attempts by the media to contact the company were unsuccessful and the plan did not proceed. Following the death of Pierre Charles on 6 January 2004, Savarin remained as Tourism Minister following the appointment of Roosevelt Skerrit as Prime Minister. The Freedom Party continued to decline and won no seats in the May 2005 General Elections. Savarin was however rewarded for his loyalty to the coalition and was named Minister for Foreign Affairs, Trade and Labour. In a 2008 Cabinet reshuffle Savarin was made Minister of Public Utilities, Ports and the Public Service. Savarin joined the Labour Party and was instrumental in the public campaign for the 2009 General Elections. He co-hosted a popular night time show alongside Attorney Anthony Astaphan and DLP stalwart Eddie Lambert. Savarin known for his platform oratory skills was also a key figure on the DLP political platform.  Trade unionist  He served as General Secretary of the Civil Service Association (CSA) for nearly two decades and almost single- handedly organised public service employees into the most powerful trade union in Dominica. During the public service protest action over a 5% salary cut in 2003, Savarin was at the forefront in defending the government's action. This aggravated the PSU leadership, with General Secretary Thomas Letang threatening to revoke Savarin's lifetime membership in the Union. Savarin gained nationwide recognition for two CSA-led strikes: the 1973 public service strike over the transfer of radio personality Daniel \\"Papa Dee\\" Cauderion, and the September–October 1977 CSA general strike that virtually crippled the island. Savarin grew in stature and was the most notable trade union leader on the island. The CSA's orientation was middle class, not working class. Though its membership came from the formerly disenfranchised Dominican working class, which had gained socio-economic ascendancy through earlier Labour Party reform, most of the CSA leadership was now sympathetic to the Freedom Party. Indeed, the CSA and other local trade union now followed the pro business and neo-colonial philosophy of the US AFL-CIO which had pursued a fiercely anti- Leftwing policy in Latin America.

The Rainbow became known as a hangout for rock musicians and their groupies. Notable regulars at the Rainbow in this period include Keith Moon, Alice Cooper, Micky Dolenz, Harry Nilsson, John Lennon, Ringo Starr, and Neil Diamond. Elvis Presley and Johnny Cash were known to have occasionally visited the Rainbow. The group of musicians calling themselves the Hollywood Vampires made the Rainbow their home away from home in the mid-1970s. In the last two decades of his life, Motörhead frontman Lemmy was a daily fixture at the Rainbow whenever the band was not on tour, and often played a video poker machine at the end of the bar table. Producer Kim Fowley used to hang out at the Rainbow, especially in 1975, when he formed the all- girl group The Runaways. Actress and musician Cheryl Smith was given her pseudonym Rainbeaux Smith early in her career as a result of her frequenting the Rainbow; she briefly replaced Sandy West as drummer of The Runaways at the end of that band's existence. As musical trends on the Strip changed towards heavy metal in the 1980s, the Rainbow followed suit.

(hanging painting at ) , also known as , was the most influential of a number of scholar-monks of the Buddhist Tendai sect active during the tenth and eleventh centuries in Japan. Genshin, who was trained in both esoteric and exoteric teachings, wrote a number of treatises pertaining to the increasingly popular Pure Land Buddhism from a Tendai viewpoint, but his magnum opus, the had considerable influence on later Pure Land teachers such as Honen and Shinran. In spite of growing political tensions within the Tendai religious hierarchy, and despite being one of the two leading disciples of the controversial Ryogen, 18th head of the Enryakuji Temple, Genshin and a small group of fellow monks maintained a secluded community at Yokawa on Mount Hiei solely devoted toward rebirth in the Pure Land, while staying largely neutral in the conflict. He was one of the thinkers who maintained that the nembutsu ritual, which was said to induce a vision of Amida, was an important hermeneutic principle in the Buddhist doctrinal system. In summarizing Genshin's teachings, he emphasized the efficacy of the nembutsu for rebirth in the Pure Land, but as part of a holistic approach using a number of mutually supportive practices such as visualization, chanting, personal conduct, etc., in contrast to the later, exclusive teaching of Honen. The purpose and intent of the Pure Land remained in Genshin's thought, within the larger Tendai approach, with the Lotus Sutra as its central teaching, an expedient means on the path to Buddhahood. Further, Genshin's teachings on the \\"deathbed nembutsu\\" ritual were highly influential in Heian Period Buddhist practice.  Biography  Genshin's life is somewhat obscure despite four different biographies written about him in the Heian Period, but what is known is that Genshin was born in Yamato Province to one Uraba no Masachika and his wife from the Kiyohara clan. His pious mother is said to have wished for a son, and prayed before a statue of the bodhisattva Kannon. After receiving a vision where a monk handed her a jewel, she is said to have become pregnant and gave birth to Genshin. Genshin took tonsure with the Tendai sect of Buddhism as a child at Enryakuji Temple, though the reasons are unknown. One theory is that his father died, since his mother and sisters also took tonsure at some point. While there, he studied under the controversial monk Ryōgen, who was active in strengthening his faction while intermingling with important political figures. Genshin, like many novice monks at Enryakuji was trained in the Tendai tradition, which included study of other traditions, both exoteric and esoteric. Later, Genshin took part in debates promoted by Ryōgen to enforce academic standards, and during one debate in 974 at the Imperial palace impressed one Taira no Chikanobu who wrote praise in his personal diary at Genshin's debate skills. From this time, Genshin also wrote a number of works on Buddhist logic, some of which were personal notes, others were meant for wider audiences. As the tension and violence between the two factions of the Tendai sect worsened, in large part due to Ryōgen's policies overtly favoring one over the other, Genshin retired to more remote Yokawa region of Mount Hiei by 981, and evidence shows increasing interest in Pure Land Buddhist teachings than before. Other disciples of Ryōgen such as Zōga (増賀, 917-1003) similarly retired in disgust with some leaving Mount Hiei entirely. It was at Yokawa that Genshin completed the Ōjōyōshū in 985, but not before completing other, smaller works on meditation methods of Amitabha Buddha. It was also during this time that Genshin joined fellow monks dwelling in Yokawa established a \\"nembutsu fellowship\\" called the . According to the records from the time, the stated goal of the Fellowship was for its members to mutually assist one another in their efforts to be reborn in the Pure Land of Amitabha Buddha and away from the turbulent of the declining age of the Dharma they believed they were living in. It is unclear if Genshin was a founding member or not, however. Genshin was both active in research and writing at this time, until around 1001 when he began participating in ceremonies at the Imperial court again. In 986, Genshin did journey on a pilgrimage to Kyushu where he came into contact with Chinese Buddhist monks (and merchant escorts) who were staying there, and they exchanged works with one another. A merchant named Yang Renzhao (楊仁昭) reported that a copy of Ōjōyōshū was deposited there at Guoqingsi Temple on Mount Tiantai some time before 990. Genshin sought to further expand contacts with the parent Tiantai community in China, but due to the An Lushan Rebellion and internal strife within the Chinese community from 1000 onward, these efforts did not achieve the expected results. By this point Genshin's fame in the Imperial court at Kyoto spread, and he was invited for lectures, events, a promotion by the court to \\"supernumerary minor bishop\\", and so on. The powerful Fujiwara no Michinaga sought him out for private religious services, but Genshin politely refused. The Tales of Genji also mentions a \\"bishop of Yokawa\\", which is thought to refer to Genshin.. In his final years, Genshin took up more writing, before he finally passed away in 1017 due to advanced age and probable illness. In his final days, he lay mostly bedridden, grasping a string tied to the hand of a statue of Amitabha Buddha per his own \\"deathbed nembutsu\\" practice. He recited verses with his disciples, and eventually died in his sleep.  Teachings  Genshin was trained in the Tendai Buddhist tradition and his writings on the Pure Land, Buddhist logic and Tendai teachings reflected an orthodox stance: * Emphasis on meditation, including various meditation practices on Amitabha Buddha, some promulgated by the founder Zhiyi and others elucidated in the Contemplation Sutra. * The Three Marks of Existence: empty, arising through external conditions, provisional. * Supremacy of the Lotus Sutra. * All practices leading to Buddhahood, including both exoteric and esoteric. Genshin, like many Buddhist monks at the time in Japan starting with the evangelist Kūya and the scholar-monk Senkan, took an increasing interest in Pure Land teachings imported from China. The prevailing belief was that the world had entered the degenerate age of the Dharma, and that the only hope for salvation lay in the reliance on the power of Amitabha. Because of this interest, and due to the worsening crisis within the Tendai monastic community, Genshin retreated from secular matters, and composed a number of treatises on Pure Land teachings, cataloging them, providing commentaries, etc. Genshin composed over 30 different documents in his lifetime. The , his largest work, is essentially a comprehensive analysis of the Pure Land path and existing practices. Genshin's interpretation of the nembutsu was a fairly orthodox interpretation at the time, relying upon visualization of Amitabha Buddha's features, and on the Pure Land. Elsewhere, Genshin acknowledged that if visualization of the Buddha was too difficult, then the nembutsu as a vocal recitation was an adequate substitute. In addition, Genshin recommended auxiliary practices such as reciting sutras, maintaining wholesome conduct and repentance of past transgressions, all mainstream Mahayana Buddhist practices. However, Genshin felt these practices were helpful in supporting the visualization of Amitabha Buddha, and thus he advocated a holistic approach.  Deathbed Nembutsu  In addition to general practices related to the Pure Land, Genshin emphasized the practice of \\"deathbed nembutsu\\" that is to say the practices performed on one's deathbed. Genshin felt that nembutsu practices performed near the hour of death were particularly important, as one's final thoughts before death had a disproportionate importance in determining one's rebirth. While the precedence existed in earlier Chinese texts, Genshin spent considerable time in the Ōjōyōshū discussing its importance, and how to concentrate on the Buddha, and enlisting support from friends to maintain concentration and practice. By maintaining focus until the last breath, Genshin felt that the practitioner would be assured of rebirth in the Pure Land, but if their mind wavered, rebirth was not certain.  Legacy  Genshin's influence in contemporary Japanese culture today is primarily due to his treatise, Ōjōyōshū, particularly its graphic descriptions of the Buddhist hell realms (地獄 jigoku), which inspired a genre of horror and morality stories. The 1960 Japanese film Jigoku was influenced by Genshin's Ōjōyōshū among other works. In Jodo Shinshu Buddhism, he is considered the Sixth Patriarch. Genshin is credited as the founder of the Enshin school of Tendai Buddhism, and for espousing the \\"original enlightenment\\" teaching, or hongaku (本覚), where one is originally enlightened, but unaware of it. In all, Genshin left more than 30 works which continue to influence Pure Land thought today. The image of Amida Nyorai in the main building of Yasaka-ji Temple in Shikoku is said to have been made by Genshin in the Heian Period.  References Further reading *Horton, Sarah (2004).

They are best known for being the band that Jonathan Davis was in, before he became the singer for Kornhttps://www.rollingstone.com/music/artists/korn in 1993. SexArt: Official music group line-up; Jonathan Davis vocalist / singer, David DeRoo played bass, Dennis Shinn played drums, Ray Solis, and Ryan Shuck played guitar. Ty Elam (singer from Videodrone, also known as the band Cradle of Thorns) appeared as a guest vocalist, sharing vocal duties on the only released SexArt track, \\"Inside\\", which featured on the Bakersfield Ca. compilation cd Cultivation '92http://www.discogs.com/Various-Cultivation-92/release/3037043 on the indie label \\"A Kick Produkt\\". SexArt performed shows often, and throughout the course of two years. SexArt participated in both the 1993 Kern County, and Fresno County \\"Battle Of The Bands\\" contests, and won them both. Jonathan Davis left the band in early 1993. Following Davis's departure, Richard Morrill auditioned and became the new singer for SexArt. Richard Morrill previously sang for Bakersfield music group L.A.P.D.. (whom later became the band Korn, having Jonathan Davis as their new singer). The SexArt (band), along with Richard Morrill, relocated from Bakersfield, to Los Angeles, Ca. Where they changed the group name to SuperModel. SuperModel Formed late 1993, SuperModel (previously named SexArt) joined with ex-singer L.A.P.D. member, Richard Morrill, and moved from Bakersfield Ca. to Los Angeles, Ca. After a year, on the later side of 1994, the band relocated to Huntington Beach Ca.. The band maintained a steady live performance all around Southern Ca. until they broke up in early 1996. SuperModel had seven songs. None of which were released, nor professionally recorded. SuperModel (post SexArt) * Richard Morrill - vocals * Dennis Shinn - drums * Ray Solis - guitar * Ryan Shuck - guitar * Dave DeRoo - bass Post-SexArt / SuperModel After leaving SexArt, Jonathan Davis continued to build his music career while singing for the music group Korn. Korn has become one of the biggest metal groups of all time, attaining more than 40 million sales worldwide. In 1996 the band \\"SuperModel\\" had dissolved. From that point Dennis Shinnhttp://dummdizzy.tripod.com/orgycredits.html had met up with Jay Gordon, and Jay Baumgardner to secure them on behalf RoadRunner Records, becoming the production team to produce the debut LP for the band Coal Chamber. From there, Dennis Shinnhttp://www.angelfire.com/sd/seemingqueer/liners.html teamed up with Jay Gordon to start a new band. Dennis Shinn - (drums), Ryan Shuck - (guitar), and Jay Gordon - (bass and vocals), becoming the early stages of the music group Orgy. Later, Dennis Shinn departed from the group to focus on music production. Ryan Shuck remained in the band, and Orgy, were signed onto the Elementree label shortly after Shinn's departure. In 1998, Orgy released their debut album \\"Candyass\\", RIAA Certified Platinum, selling almost two million copies worldwide. Ryan Shuck later departed from Orgy, to start Julien-K. Shuck also made one album, Out of Ashes, as part of the band Dead By Sunrise. Julien-K remain active. In 2019, Ryan Shuck became the singer for Adema. As \\"SuperModel\\" [band] dissolved in 1996, David DeRoo and Ray Solis returned to Bakersfield and created a new band, titled \\"Juice\\". Juice recorded a few demos and played shows extensively for a couple of years. The band dissolved in 1999 due to creative differences. Following the break-up of Juice, David DeRoo along with bandmate Tim Fluckey joined Mark Chavez (Jonathan Davis' half brother) to form Adema. The band garnished a stellar recording contract with Arista Records in 2001. Adema released their self- titled debut LP, peaking at number 27 on the Billboard Top 200. Adema became RIAA certified Gold in the US and sold over 1 million copies worldwide. Adema remain active. In 1997, following drum duties and his early departure from Orgy, Dennis Shinnhttp://uk-charts.com/showperson.asp?name=Dennis+Shinn carried out his passion for artist development, and producing music. Over the years Shinn has helped develop numerous new music groups, rap artists, and singers, securing them with record labels. From 1999 thru 2010 Shinn also fronted a post-punk music group as the lead singer. Dennis Shinn remains a music producer under the name \\"AKA MENACE\\", and has signed 7 new artist's whom he is also producing. Among them is the hiphop singer Matt Cravenhttps://thesource.com/2020/03/31/matt-craven-drops-new-single- astronaut/?fbclid=IwAR0FjJ3dslG7sPSEtnmEx_HO1VqC0jymgu- WS5fIlgmMHekr2d5UyqqK7fc Band Break-Up During the years 1992–1993, the band SexArt had been gaining momentum, local buzz, crowd attendance, as well as local radio support. Around this time is also when the band members of Korn went to watch a show by SexArt, where they spotted Jonathan Davis singing. Davis was approached by the band members of Korn to depart from SexArt and join in a band with them. This was before their very last live performance. SexArt's last show they performed with Jonathan as their singer was \\"Bakersfield's Battle of the Bands\\".Before Jon Davis joined Korn he had a private discussion with Kris Kohls (Adema/Videodrone/Cradle of Thorns drummer) to get some advice, and Kris actually drove Jon to his first practice with Korn. A few weeks later, the band all came together to do one last recording of three songs. Immediately following the last SexArt studio session, the band re-joined without Davis, in search of new singer. Discography SexArt were never signed to a record label, although creating around fifteen songs. Six of the songs were recorded at the Rick Davis recording studio called \\"Fat Tracks\\". The others were recorded on boom box, and/or 4-track recorders. The only released song by SexArt was entitled \\"Inside\\", which featured Ty Elam from Videodrone taking on the vocal duties, as Jonathan Davis appears at the ending of the song. The song was released on the Cultivation '92 compilation CD, from the label \\"A Kick Produkt\\". The band had 15 songs all together and had only semi- professionally recorded six songs over the course of three recording sessions from 1992, thru 1993. The recordings were produced inside the Rick Davis recording studio \\"Fat Tracks\\" - Bakersfield Ca. The songs chosen to be recorded; 1: Blind, 2: Follow Me, aka: Daddy, 3: I Wanna Know Why, 4: Give Up, 5: Waste My Time, and 6: Inside. The songs \\"Follow Mehttps://www.facebook.com/TheAnarky.music/videos/vb.301715713346645/336879966496886/?type=2&theater; \\\\- (now titled Daddyhttp://www.blabbermouth.net/news/korns-jonathan-davis- daddy-is-one-of-the-most-insane-emotional-songs-i-ever-wrote/), and Blind\\", represented by Korn, were originally written by Dennis Shinn. Both songs had been re-produced, and featured on Korn's 1993 demo tape Neidermayer's Mind, as well as their debut album LP self-titled 1994 debut. Accolades SexArt's \\"Blind\\" went on to become one of Korn's most iconic songs and the band's first single and music video. It has been praised by Spin Magazine and AXS as the best Korn song of all time, and by Metal Hammer and Guitar World as the best Metal song of the 1990s.

His banking career was mainly with Commerzbank and BHF-Bank in Frankfurt. From September 2004 until May 2005 he was the Lord Mayor and Senator for Economics and Harbours, as well as Senator for Culture in the Free Hanseatic City of Bremen, but he resigned following an incident in which he poured champagne over a homeless person. At present he works as a business consultant.  Qualifications, profession, family  Gloystein was born in 1945 in Bremen, Germany. After leaving school he studied Business Management at the University of Hamburg achieving his PhD in 1977 with a thesis titled \\"The promotion of industrial restructuring by funding instruments of the European Community\\", which was later published as a book entitled \\"Financing of industrial restructuring through the EC\\". From 1971 to 1975 he worked as Scientific Lecturer at the HWWA-Institut für Wirtschaftsforschung in Hamburg. Following this he moved on to investment banking at the WestLB in Düsseldorf (1975-1981). Gloystein then went on to work at the Commerzbank AG where he remained until 1999. First he was in charge of finance planning in the central department for Coordination and Planning in Frankfurt. In 1986 he moved on to be Head of the Stuttgart Branch. In 1990 he became Deputy Member of the Board and one year later Member of the Board of the Commerzbank AG. In 1999 Gloystein moved on to become Member of the Board of the BHF-Bank and at the same time Member of the Executive Committee Europe of the ING Group, Amsterdam. He became Speaker of the Board (CEO) of the BHF-Bank in 2000 in charge of Controlling, Credit-Risk Management, Law, Auditing and Corporate Communication. Gloystein resigned from the BHF and ING in 2002 as a result of differing opinions on future business strategy in the German market. At the end of the 90s Gloystein was Member of the Board of the European Banking Association and the German Member of the Maas-Commission, which was formed by the European Commission for the technical preparation of the European Monetary Union. In August 2004 the CDU nominated him as successor to Harmut Perschau, who had to resign due to health problems, and on 8 September 2004 he was voted in as the Lord Mayor and Senator for Economics and Harbours, as well as Senator for Culture in Bremen. Gloystein is married with two children. Controversy In Bremen Wine Week, on 12 May 2005, he poured a magnum of sparkling wine over a homeless man who was standing near the podium from which Mr Gloystein was speaking. Gloystein was described as laughing in the face of the crowd's boos and hisses. The homeless man burst into tears. Mr Gloystein later on offered compensation which was declined by the homeless man, responding that he is not going to be bribed. Mr Gloystein said that he had, in fact, intended to pour the wine into the man's mouth, but that he had turned away. Mr Gloystein apparently later met the homeless man again and they parted \\"on friendly terms\\". Police confirmed that the homeless man was pressing charges against Gloystein for the incident. Mr Gloystein later resigned over the incident, following pressure from the media and opposition parties. Present activities Gloystein has returned to business. He is a business consultant with focus on finance and cultural management, until 2008 in Bremen and since then in Düsseldorf. The consultancy business (M & A) was initially based on the function as Advisory Director of the Investment Bank Lincoln International, Frankfurt/Chicago, and from 2012 as Chairman of the Supervisory Board of the Deutsche Mergers & Acquitions AG, Düsseldorf. He is also active in the rating business and is Member of the Advisory Board of the Rating Agency Scope, Berlin, in the internet music business as General Manager of the classical music website My Classic World GmbH, Berlin and finally as Member of the Advisory Board of the private equity company Allistro Capital GmbH, Frankfurt.

Each closely related species differs in beak size and beak depth, allowing them to coexist in the same region since each species eats a different type of seed: the seed best fit for its unique beak. The finches with the deeper, stronger beaks consume large, tough seeds, while the finches with smaller beaks consume the smaller, softer seeds. Character displacement is the phenomenon where differences among similar species whose distributions overlap geographically are accentuated in regions where the species co-occur, but are minimized or lost where the species' distributions do not overlap. This pattern results from evolutionary change driven by biological competition among species for a limited resource (e.g. food). The rationale for character displacement stems from the competitive exclusion principle, also called Gause's Law, which contends that to coexist in a stable environment two competing species must differ in their respective ecological niche; without differentiation, one species will eliminate or exclude the other through competition. Character displacement was first explicitly explained by William L. Brown Jr. and E. O. Wilson in 1956: \\"Two closely related species have overlapping ranges. In the parts of the ranges where one species occurs alone, the populations of that species are similar to the other species and may even be very difficult to distinguish from it. In the area of overlap, where the two species occur together, the populations are more divergent and easily distinguished, i.e., they 'displace' one another in one or more characters. The characters involved can be morphological, ecological, behavioral, or physiological; they are assumed to be genetically based.\\" Brown and Wilson used the term character displacement to refer to instances of both reproductive character displacement, or reinforcement of reproductive barriers, and ecological character displacement driven by competition. As the term character displacement is commonly used, it generally refers to morphological differences due to competition. Brown and Wilson viewed character displacement as a phenomenon involved in speciation, stating, \\"we believe that it is a common aspect of geographical speciation, arising most often as a product of the genetic and ecological interaction of two (or more) newly evolved, cognate species [derived from the same immediate parental species] during their period of first contact.\\" While character displacement is important in various scenarios of speciation,Thierry Lodé \\"La guerre des sexes chez les animaux\\" 2006 Eds Odile jacob, Paris including adaptive radiations like the cichlid fish faunas in the rift lakes of East Africa, it also plays an important role in structuring communities. It also plays a role in speciation by reinforcement in such that allopatric populations overlapping in sympatry exhibit greater trait divergence. The results of numerous studies contribute evidence that character displacement often influences the evolution of resource acquisition among members of an ecological guild. Competitive release, defined as the expansion of an ecological niche in the absence of a competitor, is essentially the mirror image of character displacement. It too was described by Brown and Wilson: \\"Two closely related species are distinct where they occur together, but where one member of the pair occurs alone it converges toward the second, even to the extent of being nearly identical with it in some characters.\\"  Conceptual development  \\"Character displacement is the situation in which, when two species of animals overlap geographically, the differences between them are accentuated in the zone of sympatry and weakened or lost entirely in the parts of their ranges outside this zone\\". While the term \\"ecological character displacement\\" first appeared in the scientific literature in 1956, the idea has earlier roots. For example, Joseph Grinnell, in the classic paper that set forth the concept of the ecological niche, stated, \\"It is, of course, axiomatic that no two species regularly established in a single fauna have precisely the same niche requirements.\\" The existence of character displacement is evidence that the two species do not completely overlap in their niche requirement. Following the dissemination of the concept, character displacement was viewed as an important force in structuring ecological communities, and biologists identified numerous examples. During the late 1970s and early 1980s, however, the role of competition and character displacement in structuring communities was questioned and its importance greatly downgraded. Many found the early examples unconvincing and suggested it to be a rare phenomenon. Criticisms with earlier studies included the lack of rigor in statistical analyses and the use of poorly rationalized characters. Additionally, theory seemed to indicate that the conditions that allowed character displacement to occur were limited. This scrutiny helped motivate theoretical and methodological advances as well as the development of a more rigorous framework for testing character displacement. Six criteria have been developed to establish character displacement as the mechanism for differences between sympatric species. These include: (1) differences between sympatric taxa are greater than expected by chance; (2) differences in character states are related to differences in resource use; (3) resources are limiting, and interspecific competition for these resources is a function of character similarity; (4) resource distribution are the same in sympatry and allopatry such that differences in character states are not due to differences in resource availability; (5) differences must have evolved in situ; (6) differences must be genetically based. Rigorously testing these criteria necessitates a synthetic approach, combining areas of research like community ecology, functional morphology, adaptation, quantitative genetics and phylogenetic systematics, While satisfying all six criteria in a single study of character displacement is not often feasible, they provide the necessary context for researching character displacement. Character displacement has indicated to be a major factor in beak size among finches located in the Galápagos Islands and Hawaiian Islands.  Examples  Studies have been performed in a wide variety of taxa—a few groups having disproportionately contributed to the understanding of character displacement: mammalian carnivores, Galapagos finches, anole lizards on islands, three-spined stickleback fish, and snails.  Birds  In the initial explication of character displacement, many of the examples set forth as potential evidence for character displacement were observations between multiple pairs of birds. These included rock nuthatches in Asia, Australian honeyeaters of the genus Myzantha, Australian parrots, shearwaters in the Cape Verde Islands, flycatchers of the Bismarck Archipelago and notably, Darwin's finches in the Galapagos. David Lack found that when the two species Geospiza fortis and G. fuliginosa occurred on large islands together, they could be distinguished unequivocally by beak size. When either one occurred by itself on a smaller island, however, the beak size was intermediate in size relative to when the two co-occurred. Similarly, Peter and Rosemary Grant found that a Geospiza fortis island population diverged in beak size (due to high mortality) from competitor G. magnirostris in a year with low food supply, apparently due to increased competition for larger seeds that both species fed on. Most character displacement studies focus on morphological differences in feeding apparatus rather than on those relating to habitat use. However, comparisons of micro-habitat use and morphological adaptations of Western and Eastern Rock Nuthatches indicate that these two species show spatial niche segregation in addition to trophic niche segregation. It is often assumed that closely related species are more likely to compete than are more distantly related species, and hence many researchers investigate character displacement among species in the same genus. While character displacement was originally discussed in the context of very closely related species, evidence suggests that even interactions among distantly related species can result in character displacement. Finches and bees in the Galapagos provide support for this. Two finch species (Geospiza fuliginosa and G. difficilis) exploit more flower nectar on islands where the lager carpenter bee (Xylocopa darwini) is absent than on islands with the bees. Individual finches that harvest nectar are smaller than members of the same species that do not.In a coexistence study of four Finches such as the ground Finch (Geospiza spp), the tree Finch (Camarhynchus spp), the vegetarian Finch (Platyspiza crassirostris) and the warbler Finch (Certhidia spp) showed when competition is initially low, species might coexist even without character displacement.Many studies have measured niche (often seen in diet) overlap between closely related species, sometimes finding strong niche divergence; seen even in broad niche overlaps. The specific periods of diet divergence are seen as the main cause of adaptive divergence in morphology and performance of a bird species; which can be connected to periods of scarcity. Between the sets of Finches there were low competition. These results are due to correlation between the vast differences in diet coupled with large and adaptive differences in beak morphology. However, with similar levels of Finch phylogeny showed ongoing divergence, diet overlap and competition.  Reptiles  The lizard genus Anolis on the islands in the Caribbean has also been the subject of numerous studies investigating the role of competition and character displacement in community structure. Lesser Antilles islands can only support Anolis species of different sizes, and the relative importance of character displacement versus size at colonization in determining invasion success has been explored and debated.  Amphibians  The Appalachian salamanders Plethodon hoffmani and P. cinereus display no morphological differences, eating habits, or resource use exploitation differences among allopatric populations; when the species occurs in sympatry; however, they exhibit morphological differentiation that is associated with segregation in prey size. Where these two species co-occur, P. hoffmani has a faster closing jaw required for larger prey, and P. cinereus has a slower, stronger jaw for smaller prey. Other studies have found Plethodon salamander species that demonstrate character displacement from aggressive behavioral interference rather than exploitation. That is, morphological character displacement between the two species is due to aggressive interaction between them rather than the exploitation of different food resources.  Molluscs  On Okinawa Island, the snail species Satsuma largillierti lives on the eastern half of the island, while Satsuma eucosmia lives on the western half. Both populations overlap in sympatry along the middle of the island, where the penis length of the species differs significantly wherer they meet in sympatry. The snails' penis lengths exhibit divergence, suggesting reproductive character displacement of this trait.  Fish  Threespine sticklebacks (Gasterosteus spp.) in post-glacial lakes in western Canada have contributed significantly to recent research of character displacement. Both observations of natural populations and manipulative experiments show that when two recently evolved species occur in a single lake, two morphologies are selected for: a limnetic form that feeds in open water and a benthic form that feeds at the lake bottom. They differ in size, shape and the number and length of gill rakers, all of which is related to divergence in their diet. Hybrids between the two forms are selected against. When only one species inhabits a lake, that fish displays an intermediate morphology. Studies on other fish species have shown similar patterns of selection for benthic and limnetic morphologies, which can also lead to sympatric speciation.  Mammals  Introduced species have also provided recent \\"natural experiments\\" to investigate how rapidly character displacement can affect evolutionary change. When American mink (Mustela vison) were introduced in north-eastern Belarus, the native European mink (Mustela lutreola) increased in size, and the introduced mink decreased in size. This displacement was observed within a ten-year study, demonstrating that competition can drive rapid evolutionary change.

The center of the event is the procession of a dragon, created by first-year architecture students at the Cornell University College of Architecture, Art, and Planning. The construction is funded by selling Dragon Day t-shirts. Origins and evolution The first event was in 1901. Believing that there should be a \\"College of Architecture Day,\\" student Willard Straight of the class of 1901 led a group of architecture students around campus carrying a model dragon. This was partly inspired by the legend of St. Patrick driving all the snakes and serpents from Ireland. Lincoln Hall, which housed the College of Architecture at the time, was decorated with orange and green banners, shamrocks, and themed decorations. In the 1950s, the event evolved into its current form, with an actual constructed dragon. It is unknown when the term \\"Dragon Day\\" was coined, but it likely came into use in the 1950s. Since then, the holiday has turned into a parade for the dragon. Although it is typically carried from beneath by architecture students, in 1964 and 1976 the dragon was mounted on a car and driven through the route. In 1985, the dragon fell over as it rounded Sibley Hall, and was not able to complete its route. In 2009, due to new New York State Department of Environmental Conservation regulations , the dragon was not burned at the end of the parade route; the dragon's \\"nest\\" was burned instead. Since the dragon can no longer be burned, various tactics have been employed to create a climactic spectacle. In 2012, first year architects squirted the dragon with paint. Notably, in 2013, the white dragon was colored with multicolored Holi powder throughout the parade and at the Arts Quad finale. Politics and pranks Nerd Walk 2015 Dragon Day has been used as a form of political expression. At some point between its origin and 1920, the festivities were banned by Cornell's third president, Jacob Gould Schurman, because campus Catholics were offended by the theme. During the 1933-1934 school year, students constructed a large paper-mache beer stein to celebrate the repeal of Prohibition. In the 1950s, Dragon Day was cancelled in protest of Senator McCarthy's red scare. In 1968, the dragon was controversially painted entirely black in protest of the Vietnam War. In 1994, the possible cancellation of the Cornell in Rome architecture program prompted students to adopt a \\"Fall of Rome\\" theme. Campus pranks often surround Dragon Day. In 1966, a green pig was released into the Ivy Room, a dining hall, resulting in a massive food fight. In 1974, artist Oded Halahmy threatened to remove his outdoor sculptures from the campus after some were splattered with green paint and moved.The week before Dragon Day, the freshmen architects can be found running through campus lecture halls, barely clothed and painted green. That night they moon the windows of Uris Library's Cocktail Lounge. In 1990, the Department of Architecture severed all ties with the holiday due to the pranks, but began re-affiliating with it in 1993. Since the early 2000s, Nerd Walk has been an annual part of the event. The first-year students dress up and went through Cornell University libraries and engineering buildings (notably Duffield Hall) looking at books, attracting attention, and handing out quarter cards to advertise the Dragon Day event. Phoenix Society Engineering Phoenix 2008 Dragon Day signifies a rivalry between Cornell architecture students and those in the College of Engineering. During the second half of the 1980s, several incidents of violence between engineering and architecture students were associated with Dragon Day. Beginning in 1986, several attempts were made to channel engineers' frustrations into more creative outlets. In 1986, in the middle of the cold war, a group of civil engineering students prepared a mock ICBM which they carried in an effort to ram the dragon as it passed by the engineering quad. They were immediately stopped short by architects protecting their creation. In the spring of 1987, a larger group of engineering students came together to once again create an organized response to Dragon Day. In an effort to reduce chances of violence, the group chose to create a rather passive phoenix bird to hover over the engineering quad as the dragon passed by. Unfortunately, the helium filled giant metallized plastic balloon deflated by the time the dragon rolled around over two hours late. Not satisfied with this mediocre performance, the group founded the Phoenix Society and vowed to annually meet the dragon with an engineering avatar. Dropping the non-aggressive stance, the group unanimously voted to construct a knight on horseback in the spring of 1988. Two days before Dragon Day, architects managed to break into the engineers' workshop. Fortunately the leader of the architects persuaded his fellow students to leave the engineers' knight unharmed and the group only made off with the original Phoenix Society banner, a remnant of the original mylar phoenix balloon. Thus the knight survived to confront the dragon, his horse rearing on his hind legs and his sword raised into the air. Following this first successful engineering confrontation with the dragon, a sporadic custom has developed, with varying themes: a Viking longboat in 1989, a cobra in 2001, a penguin in 2005. In 1998 and 1999, an industrious engineer using 3/4\\" bolt cutters managed to steal the steering wheel off of the car that the architects used for the frame of the dragon. The wheels were proudly displayed on the parapets of castles that the engineers constructed on the engineering quad to meet the dragon. The holiday is still traditionally carried on by freshmen. The windows of Rand Hall, the former home of design studios of the Department of Architecture, are decorated in anticipation of the event. The Theatre, Film, and Dance Knight Not to be confused with the Engineer Knight of 1988, the Theatre, Film, and Dance Knight is a recent addition to Dragon Day, now created yearly by students from the Department of Performing and Media Arts with a budget of under $500, a build time of less than 48 hours, and a work team numbering between 5-20. This tradition was begun partially as a student response to budget cuts handed down to the Department of Theatre, Film, and Dance by the College of Arts and Sciences and serves the dual purpose of establishing campus presence and proving departmental quality by submitting a float superior to its rivals. Chants during the event frequently make reference to the department overcoming these cuts. The knight made its first appearance in the spring of 2011, when students from Cornell's Department of Theatre, Film, and Dance constructed a large knight-like figure brandishing a pole-arm and pulled it into Ho Plaza with the stated intention of \\"slaying the dragon\\". However, they were asked to kindly step to the side as the dragon passed through the square. The students complied, but then resorted to heckling the architects and chanting in protest of the budget cuts. The 2011 knight's final showing was a dramatic traversing of the Arts Quad, where the students alternated between chanting clever quips and singing \\"We Shall Overcome\\". Incarnations of the knight in past years have included a skeletal horseman atop a rearing horse in the spring of 2012, and the Black Knight from Monty Python and the Holy Grail in the spring of 2013, featuring a moving head controlled by a puppeteer and arm stumps that sprayed water at the surrounding crowd. The knight serves as a student memorial to the Department of Theatre, Film, and Dance, which has since been renamed the Department of Performing and Media Arts. Physics Unicorn 2014 Dragon Day Physics Unicorn Starting in 2014, the physics community—motivated both by being left out of Dragon Day and also by the fact that like the architects and engineers, physicists are very capable of building things—has entered the fray of Dragon Day festivities. In 2014, a team of physicists—composed of mostly graduate students, but also some undergraduate students—constructed the first annual Physics Unicorn, modeled after Twilight Sparkle. The tradition was continued in 2015 with the creation of a silver unicorn army commanded by Tyrael—that is, a student dressed up as Tyrael. Dragon Design The dragon 'float' is designed and constructed by the first-year architecture students. Construction takes place in Rand Hall shop and behind Rand Hall along University Ave. Over the years, the dragons have taken on various forms, sometimes incorporating moving elements, like wings, scales, and heads. Part of the dragon is mounted on a stripped car chassis, which is steered by a student. Dragon Day 2018 (Class of 2022) currently holds the record for the longest dragon, measuring approximately 140 feet.

This novel begins one year after the events of A Spell for Chameleon, and describes the adventures of Bink after he has settled down with his pregnant wife, Chameleon. King Trent had appointed Bink the Official Researcher of Xanth at the end of the previous book, and given him the task to discover Xanth's source of magic. After many hazards, Bink and his companions succeed but Bink makes a moral choice that ends up destroying the magic of Xanth. According to Popular Science magazine, the book is the first time the word “de-extinction” was ever used. Plot summary On his way to Queen Iris's masquerade ball in honor of Trent's accession to the throne one year before, Bink is attacked by a floating sword, which he deflects using his talent of protection against magical harm. At the ball, he is attacked again by an unseen enemy. Finally, Bink confides in King Trent, who decides to remove Bink from harm's way by sending him out on a mission to find the source of magic of Xanth. To help him, King Trent sends Chester the Centaur and the soldier Crombie. Crombie is turned into a griffin by King Trent, whose magical talent is the ability to transform living things. First, the party heads to the Good Magician Humfrey's castle, to ask his advice about their quest. When they tell him they are attempting to discover Xanth's source of magic, Humfrey decides he wants to come as well. They come across Beauregard the Demon who tells them they should abandon their quest, as it could result in the destruction of all magic in Xanth. At this time they also find Grundy the Golem, whose talent is understanding any language. This is particularly useful because Crombie in griffin form can only speak in squawks, which Grundy is able to translate. On their quest, they meet many obstacles, including a Siren, a Gorgon whose face turns men to stone, madness itself, a dragon, tangle trees, and an ogre. Bink narrowly escapes all enemies through a series of seemingly circumstantial events, due to his talent. Eventually they find the source of magic - a demon named X(A/N)th imprisoned deep below the surface. Bink is faced with a moral dilemma, to let it be free and destroy all magic in Xanth and act against the Brain Coral, or to keep it against its will. He eventually lets the magic go by freeing the demon, but is convinced by Cherie Centaur to go back and look for the demon again, hoping to convince it to stay. After some negotiation, the demon agrees under the condition that the magic shield which separated Xanth from Mundania will protect him from foolish intruders. Upon Bink's return home, he discovers his son Dor possesses a magician caliber talent - he can talk to inanimate objects.

Since its creation during the Qing dynasty (1644–1912), the dish has been regarded as a Chinese delicacy known for its rich taste, and special manner of cooking. The dish's name is an allusion to the dish's ability to entice the vegetarian monks from their temples to partake in the meat-based dish. It is high in protein and calcium. Concerns over the sustainability and welfare of sharks have limited consumption and availability of the soup. Ingredients The soup or stew consists of many ingredients, especially animal products, and requires one to two full days to prepare. A typical recipe requires many ingredients including quail eggs, bamboo shoots, scallops, sea cucumber, abalone, shark fin, fish maw, chicken, Jinhua ham, pork tendon, ginseng, mushrooms, and taro. Some recipes require up to thirty main ingredients and twelve condiments. Use of shark fin, which is sometimes harvested by shark finning, and abalone, which is implicated in destructive fishing practices, are controversial for both environmental and ethical reasons. Imitation shark fin and farmed abalone are available as alternatives. Origin There are many different stories about the origin of the dish. A common one is about a scholar traveling by foot during the Qing dynasty. While he traveled with his friends, the scholar preserved all his food for the journey in a clay jar used for holding wine. Whenever he had a meal, he warmed up the jar with the ingredients over an open fire. Once they arrived in Fuzhou, the capital of Fujian Province, the scholar started cooking the dish. The smells spread over to a nearby Buddhist monastery where monks were meditating. Although monks are not allowed to eat meat, one of the monks, tempted, jumped over the wall. A poet among the travelers said that even Buddha would jump the wall to eat the delicious dish. Consumption outside China In South Korea, the dish is known as Buldojang (불도장, the Korean reading of the same Chinese characters). It was first introduced in 1987 by Hu Deok-juk (), an ethnic Chinese chef from Taiwan at the Chinese restaurant Palsun (팔선), located in the Shilla Hotel in Seoul. The dish played an important role in changing the mainstream of Chinese cuisine consumed in South Korea from Sichuan cuisine to Cantonese cuisine. However, in 1989, the Jogye Order, the representative order of traditional Korean Buddhism, strongly opposed the selling of the dish because the name is considered a blasphemy to Buddhism. Although Buldojang temporarily disappeared, the dispute ignited the spreading of rumors among the public, and the dish consequently gained popularity. When President Moon Jae-in visited China, it was served at the state dinner. Kai Mayfair in London was dubbed \\"home of the world's most expensive soup\\" when it unveiled its £108 version of Buddha Jumps Over the Wall in 2005. The dish includes shark's fin, Japanese flower mushroom, sea cucumber, dried scallops, chicken, Hunan ham, pork, and ginseng.

It was dissolved on 31 October 2011 as part of a wider Executive Reform, and was replaced by the Dirección Nacional de Inteligencia (DNI).  Activities  DAS was tasked with providing security to state institutions and VIPs, providing judiciary police investigative services and serving as a counter-intelligence service to both external and internal threats. At DAS, citizens and foreigners living in Colombia could obtain their background records, a common requirement for a variety of transactions and services involving both state and private institutions. In addition, DAS was responsible for immigration control and the issuance of visas. Public law 218 of 2000, at section 38, states that all employees of DAS were intelligence agents. DAS worked with the Drug Enforcement Administration (DEA), an agency of the US government tasked with combating the trade of illegal narcotics.  History  The events that followed Jorge Eliécer Gaitán's assassination in 1948 provoked a violent riot in Bogotá, now known as the Bogotazo, which also started a further ten years of violence in all of Colombia known in Colombian history as La Violencia. These events also brought in a Military Government headed by General Gustavo Rojas Pinilla. Within the policies implemented by this Government was the creation, by means of Presidential Decree 2872 of 1953, of an administrative department known as the Colombian Administrative Department of Intelligence Services, (SIC). This department was in charge of Internal and External Intelligence and was created with the purpose of having an agency within the framework of the State to handle matters of intelligence, security and Constitutional enforcement. President Alberto Lleras Camargo changed the course of the SIC when he issued the Decree 1717 of 18 July 1960, substituting the SIC with the Departamento Administrativo de Seguridad (DAS), or Administrative Department of Security. The functions of the DAS were laid out by means of Decree 512 of 1989, passed during the administration of President Virgilio Barco Vargas. The DAS formally became the Security Organization of the State as an official, technical, professional and apolitical institution during the administration of President César Gaviria Trujillo, by means of Decree 2110 of 1992. During the administration of President Andrés Pastrana Arango and in compliance with the State Reform brought on by Law 489 of 1998, the Decrees 218 of 2000, and 1272 of 2000 modified the structure of the DAS, giving the DAS the same parameters, privileges and flexibility of a State Government Ministry.  1989 Headquarters Bombing  On December 6, 1989, at 7:30 AM, the Medellín Cartel detonated a bus loaded with of explosives directly in front of the headquarters building in downtown Bogotá. The explosion left 49 dead, 600 wounded and hundreds of retail outlets completely destroyed. It is considered to be the second worst terrorist act in the history of Colombia after the bombing of Avianca Flight 203. It was also the second time the cartel attempted to kill DAS director Miguel Maza Márquez using an explosive device; the first attack on May 30, 1989, left four dead and 37 wounded.  Scandals  Members of DAS have been previously accused of interacting with left-wing guerrillas, right-wing paramilitary, drug dealers and smugglers, among others. In October 2005, the content of a tape arguably containing a conversation between Special Intelligence Group Director Enrique Ariza and other DAS members, apparently discussing plans to create an intelligence office with financing from illegal paramilitary groups, was published in the Colombian press. Unspecified sources accused Vice-Director José Miguel Narváez of allegedly leaking this tape as part of a setup in order to discredit DAS Director Jorge Noguera. Director Noguera resigned and Narváez was removed from command. Subsequently, was selected as the new DAS Director, together with the announcement of polygraph tests for DAS personnel and the creation of a commission tasked with proposing reforms and a restructuring of the DAS. Between January and March 2006, new allegations came to light about DAS- paramilitary relations and former Director Noguera's potential involvement. President Uribe publicly asked Noguera to appear before the Attorney General's office, but Noguera refused alleging economic and security reasons. Noguera was then acting Consul in Milan, Italy. He later resigned, returned to the country and appeared before judicial authorities. On February 22, 2007 Noguera was arrested, accused of having ties to paramilitaries. On June 11, 2008, the Colombian Supreme Court ordered the immediate release of Jorge Noguera. According to the José Alvear Restrepo Lawyers' Collective, Noguera was only released due to procedural defects; however the charges against him, conspiracy to commit a crime, misuse of authority through an arbitrary and unjust act, and improper use of classified or secret information, may still be prosecuted. On October 24, 2008, the head of the DAS Maria del Pilar Hurtado stepped down from her post after allegations that the agency had conducted surveillance on Senator Gustavo Petro and other left-wing political opponents of President Álvaro Uribe Vélez. The incident has been dubbed The Colombian Watergate, in reference to the Watergate scandal in the United States involving President Richard Nixon and wiretapping. The allegations were later admitted to be true after some internal memos were anonymously received by Senator Petro. One ordered that information be gathered on Petro's \\"contacts with people who offer to testify against the government.\\". Hurtado said that she at no time had received or given any instructions linked to the incidents that were made public, and that she was stepping down to preserve the honour of the agency. She was under political asylum in the country of Panama and has been requested in extradition by the Colombian Government after having undergone Justice trial. Panama has declined the extradition to this date. She turned herself in on February 6, 2015, at the Colombian Embassy in Panama. , she is in prison and awaiting trial in Colombia.http://intelnews.org/2015/02/03/01-1637/ President Uribe made Joaquín Polo Montalvo the subdirector of DAS the new acting director.  Dissolution  In late 2011, President Juan Manuel Santos announced that DAS was to be replaced by a new agency, the national intelligence agency (ANIC, in Spanish). The purpose of the new agency would be solely to gather intelligence. The additional functions under the purview of DAS, namely immigration and security protocols, were distributed to the Ministry of Foreign Relations and the Ministry of the Interior.

A Conservative party politician, Abadía was the last president of the period known as the Conservative Hegemony, running unopposed and forming a one party Cabinet.  Political career  Abadía, as a young lawyer, was a professor and MP. He was appointed as Minister of Education and Minister of Government by president Pedro Nel Ospina.Gobernantes Colombianos, Ignacio Arismendi Posada, Interprint Editors Ltd., Italgraf, Segunda Edición, Page 181, Bogotá, Colombia, 1983 In 1926, Abadía runs for president as the sole candidate of the Colombian Conservative Party. The Colombian Liberal Party did not participate in this election. Thus, Abadía was elected president for the presidential term of 1926-1930. At the end of his term, a 20-year period of rule by the conservatives came to an end. Presidency: 1926-1930 Abadía, as president, had to face the difficult economic situation and world recession caused by the Great Depression. He was forced to apply the Law of 1922 by which the government was authorized to borrow money from foreign countries. His administration borrowed an enormous sum (70 million pesos) from the United States of America, mainly to promote infrastructure which greatly alleviated the unemployment situation. These borrowed funds were invested mainly in the construction of roadways, railways, waterways and sea ports. The economy was in a severe depression and the unemployment was very high. This caused a widespread social and political unrest across the nation. In 1929 Abadía sent the Colombian Army to Ciénaga where farmers were striking over horrid working conditions, they called for a minimum wage, mandatory insurance, end of hiring through sub-contractors, and an end of paying workers company coupons instead of Pesos. The soldiers shot the striking workers, massacring them in the Banana Massacre, those killed range from 100 to 2,000 dead. This event caused outrage in the Colombian Public and led to the explosion of Leftist and Revolutionary organizations, which caused the Bogotazo. Leading to a civil war entitled La Violencia. Which would be the roots for FARC and the Colombian Conflict. Worker discontent arose in the form of labor unions in 1928. With two major strikes one in the banana growing region of the State of Magdalena against the monopoly the United Fruit Company and one in the State of Santander against the Tropical Oil Company. By 1929 the civil unrest had reached Bogotá, where the students of local Universities orchestrated street protests. Abadía imposed Martial Law to maintain power.Gobernantes Colombianos, Ignacio Arismendi Posada, Interprint Editors Ltd., Italgraf, Segunda Edición, Page 183, Bogotá, Colombia, 1983 Foreign policy During his administration, the Government was concerned with resolving longstanding territorial disputes with its Latin American neighbors. On 24 March 1928, the Abadía Administration under Manuel Esguerra, Envoy Extraordinary and Minister Plenipotentiary of Colombia to Managua, negotiated and signed the Esguerra-Bárcenas Treaty with José Bárcenas Meneses, the Minister of Foreign Affairs of Nicaragua, in which Nicaragua recognized the sovereignty of Colombia over the Archipelago of San Andrés, Providencia and Santa Catalina and by which Colombia ceded claims over the Mosquito Coast, both territories that belonged to Colombia uti possidetis juris following Independence from Spain. On 19 March 1928, Congress ratified the Salomón–Lozano Treaty signed on 24 March 1924 by Fabio Lozano Torrijos, Envoy Extraordinary and Minister Plenipotentiary of Colombia to Peru, and Alberto Salomón Osorio, the Minister of Foreign Relations of Peru, the treaty demarcated once and for all the border between Colombia and Peru, and put a temporary end to military activities between the two nations along the border. The last important border treaty during the Abadía Administration was signed on 15 November 1928 between Laureano García Ortiz, Envoy Extraordinary and Minister Plenipotentiary of Colombia to Brazil, and Otávio Mangabeira, Minister of External Relations of Brazil, the Mangabeira-García Ortiz Treaty was a response to Ecuadorian and Peruvian aspirations of gaining eastern access to Brazil by way of the Apaporis river, a tributary to the Caquetá/Japurá River, this treaty settled once and for all the Brazil–Colombia border. During his Administration, Abadía had to contend with the growing discontent of Colombian fruit workers in the Caribbean Region and the economical and political interests of the United States in the region. On November 1928, workers of the United Fruit Company in the Department of Magdalena mounted a strike protesting unfair labour practices and conditions imposed by the company to the workers and the community at large, the United States responded by threatening to mount a military invasion of some sort to bring to an end the strike. The Government responded by sending in the Military to quell the protests and arrest the labour workers accused of instigating the strike, what happened next is known as the Banana massacre where an undetermined number of people were killed by the Colombian Army; this event was recounted by Gabriel García Márquez in his novel One Hundred Years of Solitude. This event marked the decline of the United Fruit Company influence in the region and created a large discontent among the population of the Caribbean Region towards the United States, the Liberal politician Jorge Eliécer Gaitán would mount a large campaign to investigate and bring into account the actions taken by the Abadía Administration in the handling of this event, his popularity rose in opposition to that of Abadía and the Conservative party, something that would bring about their decline soon after. Personal life Born July 5, 1867 in Las Vegas de Los Padres, his family's estate in Coello, Tolima, in the United States of Colombia, to Miguel Abadía C. and Arcelia Méndez. He died in La Union, Cundinamarca, on May 9, 1947.

The Night Stallion, ruler of the gourd realm, makes Imbri the liaison to the day world and sends her to meet Trent, King of Xanth, with the message, \\"Beware the Horseman\\". Imbri leaves the gourd realm and sets out for Castle Roogna with her warning. Along the way she meets a white stallion, which she calls the day horse, with a brass bracelet around one leg, who is scared by her attempt at contact via a brief daydream, and runs away. She also meets an intelligent man wearing a brass bracelet, similar to that of the day horse. He asks her if she has seen the horse and convinces her to allow him to ride her so they can track it. She allows him to insert a bit into her mouth, but dislikes it and asks him to remove it. He refuses and uses spurs on her, capturing her. Imbri asks the man who he is, and he says \\"I am the Horseman\\". He then corrals her at his camp and builds a large bonfire to shine light on her and prevent her from turning intangible during the night. As the Horseman and his henchmen sleep, the day horse approaches. She tells him of her plight, and he affirms that he is terrified of the Horseman, but assists her anyway by urinating on the fire and enabling her to escape. Imbri makes her way to Castle Roogna. She arrives in time to witness the elopement of Prince Dor and King Trent's daughter, Princess Irene. Upon becoming acquainted with Chameleon, the wife of Bink and mother of Prince Dor, she is led to find King Trent, only to discover that he has been ensorcelled, staring blankly into space. Prince Dor, next in line to the crown and newly wed to Princess Irene, assumes the throne. He informs Imbri and others that the Nextwave Invasion is occurring; an army of barbarians from the neighbouring, non-magical land of Mundania has just entered Xanth. King Dor orders Imbri and Chameleon to seek advice from the Good Magician Humphrey. Imbri and Chameleon travel to Humphrey's castle and navigate through the standard three challenges, gaining access to the inside. The old man casually repeats the Night Stallion's warning, \\"Beware the Horseman\\" and adds another cryptic instruction: \\"Break the chain.\\" After battling the Mundanes with King Trent's army from A Spell For Chameleon, Dor falls to the same ensorcellement as King Trent. Since the law of Xanth requires that a Magician sit on the throne, the Zombie Master (Jonathon) becomes the new king. Jonathan's magic talent is to reanimate the deceased, and he rallies his zombies to form an army to fight the Punic invasion from Mundania, but falls to the same bewitchment as Trent and Dor. Humphrey assumes the throne, and prepares himself for battle against the Punic horde and its leader Hasbinbad. He informs Imbri, much to the chagrin of the Gorgon, that he is not destined to be the saviour of Xanth, and that he expects to make a tragic mistake in battle. Before departing to the battle, Humphrey identifies his successor: Dor's father Bink, whom everybody assumed had no magic talent. Humphrey reveals to Queen Iris that Bink's talent is immunity from magical harm. It is hoped Bink will be immune from the effects of the Horseman's spell. Imbri is sent north to the border of Mundania, where Bink and the centaur scholar Arnolde are traveling. Imbri brings news to Bink and Arnolde of the invasion, and informs Bink of the situation. Bink agrees to return with Imbri and instructs Arnolde to follow, as he is next in the line of succession. Bink and Imbri travel to the baobab tree and find Humphrey, taken by the power of the enemy. He has a bottle in his hand, and when Bink uncorks it, Humphrey's voice emits from it, with one word: \\"Horseman\\". Bink surmises that Humphrey's voice was identifying his assailant, and that they now know who was ensorcelling the kings. Bink and Imbri prepare for battle alone, armed with Humphrey's numerous spells and potions. They set aside a box marked \\"Pandora\\". He and Imbri are victorious but are separated in the battle. When Imbri tracks down Bink, she finds that he has killed the Punic leader Hasbinbad, but has been taken with the Horseman's power nonetheless. Imbri returns to Castle Roogna to inform Arnolde the Centaur that he is now King of Xanth. Arnolde begins laying plans for his successor, and he interprets Xanthian law to his advantage. The law states that the king must be a Magician but had no precedence on whether the king had to be human or what sex. Arnolde states that a Sorceress is simply a female Magician, and that the law does not prohibit a woman from becoming king. He selects Queen Iris to be his successor, and he proclaims her daughter Irene to be a full Sorceress, thus establishing who would be the seventh and eights kings after him. Arnolde then instructs Imbri to report to the Night Stallion with an update. King Arnolde, realising that the previous king's condition is similar to that of a person trapped by the hypno gourd, sends Imbri through, to the Night Stallion's dimension, to see if the missing Kings are within. Upon arrival, Imbri is amazed to learn that all five of the bewitched kings are present in the gourd. They surmise that the Horseman's magic talent is to connect a person's line of sight to another object, and that he has used this ability to make them all see into a hypnogourd, trapping their souls inside. Imbri brings this news to Castle Roogna, and eventually brings Princess Irene to the gourd to visit her new husband Dor, taken from her after their nuptials. Shortly after the pair return to Castle Roogna, Arnolde is taken by the Horseman, and Queen Iris becomes King Iris, the first female king. Iris uses her talent of illusion to inflict massive casualties on the Punic horde, who are now marching on Castle Roogna under the command of the Horseman. She briefly forms an image of her own face in front of the Horseman to mock him, whereupon he simply uses his talent to enscroll her. Princess Irene becomes king of Xanth next, and she identifies Chameleon as the next king, stating that, although Chameleon does not have Magician-Caliber talent, she would be the best option for king because she is in her ugly, but extremely intelligent phase. The Horseman expends nearly the rest of his forces in reaching Castle Roogna. Chameleon, realising that the Day Horse and the Horseman are one and the same, lures him into the castle, and once he is inside, Irene uses her talent of accelerated plant growth to wrap the castle in a tight cocoon of plants, trapping him inside. Enraged, he uses his magic to ensnare her, whereupon Chameleon becomes king of Xanth and informs him that he will fail. He takes Chameleon with his power, too, and Xanth is left without a king. Imbri, having been previously named the Tenth King by Chameleon, because she is a creature of the Gourd, and can not enter the world via the peep hole, and therefore can not be forced into it, returns to castle Roogna. Imbri enters Roogna at night, so she is able to slip by the plants, and confronts the Horseman. He is now sitting on the throne, having proclaimed himself the new king of Xanth. As Imbri approaches, he shifts into his alternate form, and Imbri is stricken; she is in season, and he is a male horse. She is unable to act under his dominating power, but when the barbarians break into the castle and call out for their leader, he shifts back to his human form to answer. Imbri attacks and kills him, but the nine catatonic kings do not revive. Imbri realizes that the Horseman's magic talent was shape-shifting, and that the bands he wore around his wrists were magical bands that allowed him to perform his enscrollement. Devastated, and with nothing to lose, she destroys the box marked PANDORA, and is surrounded by a pink smoke, and feels suddenly hopeful. She removes the band but does not destroy it, because that might not accomplish the goal of releasing the kings. She decides to travel to the Void, an area in the Elemental region of Xanth, from which nothing can escape. She takes the band there and throws it in, but is trapped by the gravitational pull of the Void. Terrified, her physical body is destroyed by the Void. The nine kings revive as the magical band is destroyed, and Imbri returns as a day mare, thanks to Humfrey, and is now charged with bringing pleasant daydreams instead of nightmares to the people of Xanth. King Trent and Queen Iris retire, leaving the throne to their new son-in-law, King Dor.

She was born in Tel Aviv. Early life Kunda was born in Tel Aviv in 1955. Her parents were from Oudtshoorn, a small South African town. They immigrated from different parts of Europe to Oudtshoorn to find safety from the persecutions of Jews before and during World War II. In Kunda's autobiography, she shares her parents' background, their parents, and her early childhood. Education Kunda obtained her PhD and MA in Psychology in 1985 at the University of Michigan, and her BA in Psychology at the Hebrew University in 1978. Directly after finishing her PhD, she became an Assistant Professor at Princeton University in the Psychology Department. In 1992, she moved to Waterloo, Ontario, where she was Associate Professor of Psychology at the University of Waterloo. In 1997, she became a full Professor. Kunda's profile on the Social Psychology Network is actively maintained by social psychologist Scott Plous, in order to provide a resource for those interested in Kunda's work. Publications and research In 1999, Kunda authored the textbook Social Cognition: Making Sense of People; one of the books she is well known for. In this book, Kunda begins by painting a picture of the birth of social psychology and cognitive psychology. Before the prominence of these fields, psychology was dominated by behavioral psychology which focused on studying only observable human behavior; B. F. Skinner's \\"black box\\" framed any internal happenings of the human mind as an enigma that should not be explored. However, Kunda highlights in the book how, with the rise of the study of cognition in the 1950s and beyond due to the increase of technological research tools (fMRI, EEG, etc), cognitive scientists began to break down the barriers to understanding human cognition. Kunda covers many topics in the book, from stereotyping and emotional effects on cognition to judgements and behavior. She points out that the topic of social cognition, unique in that most humans have interacted with other humans and therefore have many personal experiences with this research field, collects many presumptions from \\"lay people\\" and psychologists alike. Kunda therefore emphasizes not only what the theories of social cognition are, but also how the theories and empirical findings were developed to highlight efficacy. Kunda wrote as an overview of her research: > One line of my work examines how stereotypes are activated, used, and > modified. Under what circumstances, for example, will the stereotypes of an > ethnic or an occupational group come to mind as one is interacting with a > member of these groups? How will a person's behavior influence which of the > stereotypes relevant to that person are on one's mind? Under what > circumstances will relevant stereotypes influence one's evaluation of a > person? Another line of my work examines how outstanding individuals > influence people's self-views and motivation. When will a superstar give > rise to inspiration and self-enhancement, and when to discouragement and > self-deflation? This contextual understanding of how people stereotype added a new dimension to this body of work. Specifically, Kunda's work with Stephen Spencer looked at temporal aspects of stereotyping in their paper \\"When Do Stereotypes Come to Mind and When Do They Color Judgment?\\" They found that when someone is engaging with another individual in a stereotyped group, that person is not always thinking about the group's stereotype. When they do think about the stereotype, the stereotype does not always play a role in their judgements. Kunda also found that when stereotypes change, they usually do so incrementally or through causal reasoning. Her paper \\"The Case for Motivated Reasoning\\", published in Psychological Bulletin in 1990, posthumously received the Scientific Impact Award from the Society of Experimental Social Psychology. In this paper, Kunda describes how, when reasoning, humans usually arrive at the conclusion they want to, but this is limited by whether or not they are able to provide justifications for this conclusion. She highlights the danger if, instead of taking this self-affirming bias into account, we perceive our own and others' reasoning as objective. Finally, she notes that truly objective reasoning is often needed to explore the full range of possible outcomes. In 2004, Kunda died from cancer. She is survived by her husband Paul Thagard, a professor of philosophy at the University of Waterloo, and two sons.

The record as a whole was dubbed indie folk, indie rock, Celtic rock, alternative rock, and lo-fi by different professional music critics.

It is a song cycle inspired by the animals of the Chinese zodiac. The album was reworked and rearranged for string instruments and released in 2009 as Run Rabbit Run. Concept and production Each song on the album corresponds to a different part of the Chinese zodiac, with the exception of \\"Year of Our Lord\\" which, like many of Stevens' songs, references his Christian faith. In an interview with Delusions of Adequacy, Stevens reveals that he, \\"wanted to create an aural environment for each animal: a movie soundtrack (without the movie).\\" He also described the relationship of imagination in listeners to the instrumental nature of the album, saying, \\"Many people say the same thing: that they inevitably end up visualizing a place or a picture when listening (carefully) to the album. Maybe this is the purpose of instrumental music in the first place. There are no lyrics (or narrative) to encourage the listener. Therefore you are free to imagine what you like.\\" The process of creating the album \\"required tremendous patience and self-abnegation\\", with Stevens noting that he \\"amassed hours (months, years) of raw material\\" until he \\"was left with the most minute sample of something ... which might somehow, in some abstract way, resemble an ox, or a rooster, or a horse\\". Like much of Stevens' music, Enjoy Your Rabbit had a religious component in its conception, with Stevens describing how he \\"put together argumentative essays, stanzas of free verse poetry, persuasive dissertations and assertions ... to prove the existence of God based on the 12-year lunar calendar.\\" Critical reception Enjoy Your Rabbit received generally positive reviews. Michael Crumsho of Dusted described it as \\"a great record\\", noting Stevens' ability to \\"produce melodies that are uplifting, catchy and memorable\\" but critically remarking that it \\"remains to be seen, however, if Sufjan will learn that the most elaborate path from Point A to B is not necessarily the best\\".

Kerferd was born in Liverpool, the son of G. B. Kerferd, a merchant (or Joseph Kerferd, a bookkeeper, and his wife Rachel, née Blundell) Kerferd was educated at the Collegiate Institute, Liverpool, with intentions of studying law; however circumstances led him to enter his father's business. Kerferd emigrated to Victoria in 1853 with plans to open a branch of the family business, but this did not eventuate. After trying his luck as a gold miner at Bendigo, he settled in BeechworthGeorge Biscoe Kerferd at beechworth.com.au and became a brewer and wine merchant. He was mayor of Beechworth 1863-64 and three other occasions. In 1853 he married Ann Martindale, with whom he had ten children. Kerferd was admitted to the Melbourne bar in 1867 but did not practise as a lawyer. Kerferd was elected to the Legislative Assembly for the Ovens in November 1864, and represented the area continuously until February 1886. He began studying law in 1864 and was Minister for Mines and Vice-President of the Board of Land and Works in the government of James McCulloch 1868, and Solicitor-General 1872–1874, and Attorney-General in 1874 in the government of James Francis. When the Francis government was defeated in July 1874, Kerferd succeeded him at the head of a new conservative ministry. Kerferd's Treasurer, James Service, was, like most colonial conservatives, a convinced free trader, and the government's 1875 budget proposed repealing the tariffs imposed by Charles Gavan Duffy's liberal government, and replacing the lost revenue with a land tax and a tax on beer and spirits. But this offended both the landowners and the business community, and Kerferd's government was defeated in August 1875. Kerferd was again appointed as Attorney-General in later conservative governments (1875–1877, 1880 and 1883–86, in the Service government). In 1883 Kerferd was a Victorian representative to the federal convention. In 1886, he quit politics and on 1 January 1886 was appointed to the Supreme Court of Victoria. The appointment was not without controversy as several barristers had served longer in the legal profession, but Kerferd had eight years as attorney-general. There was general agreement that Kerferd filled his role as judge with great ability. Kerferd served as a judge until his death in 1889 while on a holiday at Sorrento, Victoria. Kerferd Road in Albert Park is named after him. Kerferd Road, later Avenue, in Sorrento is also named after him.

The play went through several incarnations before it was finally published. MacLeish began the work in 1953 as a one-act production but within three years had expanded it to a full three-act manuscript. There are two versions of J.B. available: the original book, published by Houghton Mifflin Harcourt, and the script which MacLeish revised substantially for Broadway, published by Samuel French Inc.

They overhear J.B., a wealthy New York banker, describe his prosperity as a just reward for his faithfulness to God. Scorning him, Nickles wagers that J.B. will curse God if his life is ruined. Nickles and Zuss then watch as J.B.'s children are killed and his property is ruined and the former millionaire is left to the streets. J.B. is then visited by three Comforters: Bildad, Eliphaz and Zophar (representing History, Science, and Religion) who each offer a different explanation for his plight. J.B. declines to believe any of them, instead asking God himself to explain. Instead he encounters Zuss and Nickles. Nickles urges him to commit suicide in order to spite God; Zuss offers him his old life back if he will promise to obey God. J.B. rejects them both, and instead finds comfort in the person of his wife Sarah. The play ends with the two building a new life together.

The more fertile part of Pahranagat Valley is a narrow ribbon of green (no more than wide) like an oasis in the vast Nevada desert. It is approximately long running north and south and is watered by three large natural springs of water (Hiko Springs, Crystal Springs and Ash Springs) and many smaller ones as well. It has four lakes, two near the north end of the valley (Nesbitt Lake and Frenchie Lake) and two towards the south end (Upper Pahranagat Lake and Lower Pahranagat Lake). The southern half of the valley including the two lakes is home to the Pahranagat Valley National Wildlife Refuge. Pahranagat Valley is bordered on the west by a range of mountains called the Mount Irish Range and then the Pahranagat Range. It is bordered on the east by the Hiko Range. State Route 318 and then U.S. Route 93 traverse the entire length of the valley. The more inhabited areas in Pahranagat Valley include (from north to south) Hiko, Ash Springs, Richardville and Alamo, the town of Alamo being the largest and where all of the schools for the valley are located. The closest town to Pahranagat Valley is over to the east at Caliente, Nevada. History The Crystal Springs area, used as a watering spot and campsite, was a principal stop-over on the Mormon Trail Alternate Route. In the late 1850s, the area was a haven for outlaws who pastured hundreds of head of stolen cattle and horses on its meadows. Silver ore was discovered in 1865 on Mount Irish, and Logan sprang briefly into existence. A mill to process the ore was built in Hiko, the ruins of which are still in existence. Since the late 19th century, Pahranagat Valley has been primarily an agricultural community. Presently it is also a bedroom community for many who work in Las Vegas even though the commute is over one way. Geology Landscape showing Alamo impact breccia (arrow) near Hancock Summit, Pahranagat Range, Nevada.

Five people were killed and 748 injured. A wrong-side failure of the signalling system, as a result of human intervention, was believed to be the cause.  The crash  Two suburban passenger trains, the first travelling to East Hills the following train travelling to Bankstown, collided at about 12:30pm. The Bankstown train was travelling at a few seconds before the crash. Both trains were crowded, each with around 1200 passengers, many travelling home after work (it being a Saturday), and Christmas shoppers. The East Hills train was being held at a home signal just on the Sydney side of Sydenham Junction station. The two leading cars of the Bankstown train telescoped into the two trailing cars of the East Hills train.  Synopsis  Signals behind the East Hills train should have been showing stop to protect the train, it was established that the signals were in fact showing proceed giving the following train the belief that the line ahead was clear. In the accident, a signal electrician was attending a failure of a track circuit. To help keep the trains moving, he manipulated the track circuit relay with a screwdriver. Distracted by a telephone call, he forgot to remove the screwdriver to drop the track circuit relay when the section became occupied by a train, allowing a second train to see green signals and collide with the first. The driver of the second train (the Bankstown train) was charged with manslaughter, accused of being under the influence of alcohol. He was later acquitted of the charge by a jury. A Signals Electrician was also charged with manslaughter for his part in the incident.  Aftermath  Since that time, training and procedures for signal electricians have been strengthened and it is clearly stated in railway rules that in the event of a track circuit failure, no attempt shall be made to clear any of the signals controlled by the track circuit by manipulation of the track circuit relay... Two carriages of the East Hills train (the second and sixth) were older wooden bodied carriages and it was claimed this may have contributed to the deaths and injuries, although the Bankstown train, a fully steel carriage train, suffered more damage.

They formed in 1999 when Tim Armstrong (of the bands Rancid and Operation Ivy) played his friend and roadie Rob Aston some beats he had made using Pro Tools and asked Aston if he would consider contributing lyrics. Initially, Armstrong played all the instruments himself, but as the project grew, he invited musician friends such as Matt Freeman (Rancid), Lars Frederiksen (Rancid), and Vic Ruggiero (The Slackers) to add to the sound. Before long, Armstrong and Aston decided to officially form a band, but to make things complete, they wanted a drummer, so Travis Barker from Blink-182 was asked to join in 2002. After the release of their first album, Transplants briefly disbanded in 2003, due to all members being involved in their own projects, including Rancid and Blink-182. Then in 2004, they reunited to record their second album (Haunted Cities) before going on hiatus again until 2010 when the band started to record new material. This new material was released as In a Warzone in 2013. History=Transplants and first hiatus (2002–2003) After two years of recording, Transplants released their debut album Transplants on Hellcat Records in October 2002. In the end, the album was recorded and mixed entirely in Armstrong's basement. Special guest vocalists included Eric Ozenne (The Nerve Agents), Davey Havok (AFI), Son Doobie (Funkdoobiest), Danny Diablo (Crown of Thornz, AKA Lord Ezec), Lars Frederiksen (Rancid) and Brody Dalle (The Distillers, ex-wife of Armstrong). Brody sings on the track \\"Weigh on My Mind\\", which Armstrong, at the time, described as \\"their song.\\" The singles \\"Diamonds and Guns\\" and \\"D.J. D.J.\\" quickly became MTV favorites and earned the band critical and commercial success. \\"Diamonds and Guns\\" and its unmistakable piano hook played by co-producer Dave Carlock was featured in TV commercials for Garnier Fructis shampoo and Neutrogena, and both this and the song \\"Tall Cans in the Air\\" were featured on the soundtrack for the 2003 movie Bulletproof Monk. By 2003, the band had temporarily disbanded, while Barker worked on then-upcoming Blink-182 album, and Armstrong worked on Rancid's Indestructible. Haunted Cities (2004–2005) In 2004, during an extensive Rancid hiatus, Armstrong decided to bring Transplants back together. The band's second album, titled Haunted Cities, was released in June 2005, just four months after Barker's former band Blink-182 announced their hiatus. The album's first single, \\"Gangsters and Thugs\\" was a hit and the band began touring on the 2005 Warped Tour. After the Warped Tour, Transplants started to plan a large North American tour with Pennywise and wanted to release a second single. The band shot and released another video for the single \\"What I Can't Describe.\\" The band released the Chopped and screwed version of Haunted Cities on November 1, 2005. Soon after the cancellation of the tour, two band members announced several more side projects that they would be embarking on during Transplants break. Barker revealed that he would be starting a tour with DJ AM and also a new band with Aston and DJ Paul Wall which would become Expensive Taste. Aston revealed that he was working on a solo album. Second hiatus (2006–2010) In an interview with Aston and Paul Wall on January 16, 2006 about their project, Expensive Taste, Aston stated \\"The Warped Tour had just ended and Transplants had just broken up\\".BallerStatus.com  Hip-Hop, R&B; & Urban Lifestyle Portal This led to some confusion over whether the band had officially broken up, or not. Despite the statement made by Aston about how the band had \\"broken up\\", frontman Tim Armstrong contradicted this statement on a MySpace bulletin. He stated: \\"In the upcoming years, I hope to make another Transplants album. I love recording with those guys\\". From 2006 to 2009, Transplants had been \\"on hold\\", as all the members had continued working on their own projects. Armstrong was busy touring with Rancid promoting their new album, Let the Dominoes Fall. He also released his solo album, A Poet's Life, in 2007. Travis Barker worked on an album with a recently reformed Blink-182, who toured during the summer of 2009, and also formed a new band called Expensive Taste, along with Aston. Second reunion (2010–present) In January 2010, Barker announced on his Twitter account that Transplants were reunited and are in fact recording new material in 2010. The band announced that their new website will be posted in February 2011. It was also announced that the third album will be released on the band's original home at Hellcat Records. Armstrong and Aston appeared as guests on Barker's first solo album Give the Drummer Some along with former Guns N' Roses guitarist Slash on a Latin rock influenced song called \\"Saturday Night\\". The band performed the song live on Conan March 7, 2011, with Mix Master Mike on turntables, Elvis Cortez on guitar and Kevin Bivona on bass. Slash did not take part in the performance. In an interview with 29-95 in April 2011, Barker has revealed that material for the Transplants album has been written since August 2010, and that 16 songs were already written by Armstrong, Aston and Barker for the album. He has also said that he expects around 30 songs to be written, with the best 12 to 15 making the cut. On November 13, 2011, an announcement was made from the band's official Facebook page that they will be finishing up their new album in December. On November 29, Armstrong revealed that the album is slated for a spring 2012 release date, which will be followed by a new Rancid album in that summer. On December 16, 2011, Aston posted a photo on Facebook revealing Kevin \\"Sweatshop\\" Bivona as the newest member. After assorted announcements during 2012, the third album, titled In a Warzone, was finally released June 25, 2013. The first single, \\"In a Warzone\\", came out April 2, 2013; a second single, \\"Come Around\\", was released the following week on April 9. On February 28, 2014, it was revealed on the band's official Facebook page, that the band had begun writing and recording new material. On April 28, 2015, Barker announced that Transplants are almost finished with the recording of several cover songs. He released a list with song titles including songs by bands like Circle Jerks, Unwritten Law, Cypress Hill, Minor Threat, Beastie Boys, House of Pain, and Sepultura. On January 19, 2017, Barker confirmed that Transplants will be releasing a covers album. On June 6, 2017, the band posted \\"Friday the 13th. October 2017.\\" on their Facebook page, which leads to rumors this might be the date for the release of the announced record.

She was completed before World War I as part of the 1911 naval building programme. She spent the war in the Mediterranean, spending most of 1914 providing gunfire support for the Montenegrin Army until her sister ship was torpedoed by the submarine on 21 December. She spent the rest of the war providing cover for the Otranto Barrage that blockaded the Austro-Hungarian Navy in the Adriatic Sea. Paris supported French and Spanish troops in 1925 during the Third Rif War before becoming a school ship in 1931. She was modernized in three separate refits between the wars even though she was not deemed to be a first-class battleship. She remained in that role until the Battle of France, which began on 10 May 1940, after which she was hastily rearmed. She supported Allied troops in the defence of Le Havre during June until she was damaged by a German bomb, but she took refuge later that month in England. As part of Operation Catapult, she was seized in Plymouth by British forces on 3 July. She was used as a depot ship and barracks ship there by the Royal and Polish Navies for the rest of the war. Returned to the French in July 1945 she was towed to Brest the following month and used as a depot ship until she was stricken on 21 December 1955. Background and description Right elevation and deck plan as depicted in Brassey's Naval Annual 1912 By 1909 the French Navy was finally convinced of the superiority of the all-big-gun battleship like over the mixed-calibre designs like the which had preceded the Courbets. The following year, the new Minister of the Navy, Augustin Boué de Lapeyrère, selected a design that was comparable to the foreign dreadnoughts then under construction to be built as part of the 1906 Naval Programme.Jordan & Caresse, pp. 139–140 The ships were long overallGardiner & Gray, p. 197 and had a beam of and a mean draught of . They displaced at normal load and at deep load. Their crew numbered 1,115 men as a private ship and increased to 1,187 when serving as a flagship. The ships were powered by two licence-built Parsons steam turbine sets, each driving two propeller shafts using steam provided by 24 Belleville boilers.Jordan & Caresse, p. 143 These boilers were coal-burning with auxiliary oil sprayers and were designed to produce .Whitley, p. 36 The ships had a designed speed of . The Courbet-class ships carried enough coal and fuel oil to give them a range at a speed of . The main battery of the Courbet class consisted of twelve Canon de Modèle 1906–1910 guns mounted in six twin-gun turrets, with two pairs of superfiring turrets fore and aft of the superstructure, and a pair of wing turrets amidships. Their secondary armament was twenty-two Canon de Modèle 1910 guns, which were mounted in casemates in the hull. Four Canon de Modèle 1902 Hotchkiss guns were fitted, two on each broadside in the superstructure. They were also armed with four submerged torpedo tubes and could stow 10 mines below decks. The ships' waterline belt ranged in thickness from and was thickest amidships. The gun turrets were protected by 250 mm of armour and plates protected the casemates. The curved armoured deck was thick on the flat and on the outer slopes. The conning tower had a thick face and sides.Jordan & Caresse, pp. 143, 150, 156–158 Construction and career The ship was ordered on 1 August 1911Dumas, p. 162 and named after the French capital city.Silverstone, p. 107 She was laid down on 10 November 1911 by Forges et Chantiers de la Méditerranée at its shipyard in La Seyne and launched on 28 September 1912. Due to the rising tensions in Europe in mid-1914, the ship was commissioned into the fleet on 1 August before she was formally completed on 14 August at a cost of F63,000,000. Paris was assigned to the 1st Division (1ère Division) of the 2nd Battle Squadron (2ème Escadre de ligne) of the 1st Naval Army (1ère Armée Navale) on 1 August, but did not join her squadron until 5 September.Jordan & Caresse, pp. 142, 244 After working up she was sent, along with her sisters, to the Mediterranean Sea. She spent most of the rest of 1914 providing gunfire support for the Montenegrin Army until hit Jean Bart on 21 December with a torpedo. This forced the battleships to fall back to either Malta or Bizerte to cover the Otranto Barrage. After the French occupied the neutral Greek island of Corfu in 1916 she moved forward to Corfu and Argostoli, but her activities were very limited as much of her crew was used to man anti-submarine ships.Whitley, p. 38 Before the end of the war she was fitted with seven Mle 1897 anti-aircraft (AA) guns in single mounts.Dumas, p. 226 These guns were adaptions of the famous French Mle 97 75-mm field gun. Interwar years Paris was sent to Pula on 12 December 1918 to supervise the surrendered Austro-Hungarian fleet, where she remained until 25 March 1919. She provided cover for Greek troops during the Occupation of İzmir (Smyrna) from May 1919 before returning to Toulon on 30 June 1919.Whitley, p. 38 She collided with the destroyer Bouclier at Toulon on 27 June 1922; both ships suffered severe damage. Paris received the first of her upgrades at Brest between 25 October 1922 and 25 November 1923. This included replacing one set of boilers with oil-fired boilers, increasing the maximum elevation of the main armament from 12° to 23°, removal of her bow armour to make her less bow-heavy, the installation of a fire-control director, with a rangefinder, and the exchange of her Mle 1897 AA guns for Mle 1918 guns.Dumas, p. 225 After her return to service she supported an amphibious landing at Al Hoceima by Spanish troops during the summer of 1925 after the Rifs attacked French Morocco during the Third Rif War. She destroyed coastal defence batteries there despite taking light damage from six hits and remained there until October as the flagship of the French forces. She was refitted again from 16 August 1927 to 15 January 1929 at Toulon and her fire- control systems were comprehensively upgraded. A large cruiser-type fire- control director was added atop the foremast with a 4.57-m coincidence rangefinder and a stereo rangefinder. The rangefinder above the conning tower was replaced by a duplex unit carrying two 4.57-m rangefinders and another 4.57-m rangefinder was added in an armoured hood next to the main mast. Two directors for the secondary guns were added on the navigation bridge, each with a coincidence rangefinder. A rangefinder was added to the roof of 'B' turret, the second one from the bow. Three rangefinders were provided for her anti-aircraft guns, one on top of the duplex unit on the conning tower, one on 'B' turret and one in the aft superstructure. She resumed her role as flagship of the 2nd Division of the 1st Squadron of the Mediterranean Squadron until 1 October 1931 when she became a training ship. Paris was overhauled again between 1 July 1934 and 21 May 1935. Her boilers were overhauled, her main guns replaced and her Mle 1918 AA guns were exchanged for more modern Mle 1922 guns. They had a maximum depression of 10° and a maximum elevation of 90°. They fired a shell at a muzzle velocity of at a rate of fire of 8–18 rounds per minute and had a maximum effective ceiling of . World War II Paris leaving HM Dockyard, Devonport, July 1940 Paris and Courbet formed a Fifth Squadron at the beginning of the war. They were transferred to the Atlantic to continue their training duties without interference. Both ships were ordered restored to operational status on 21 May 1940 by Amiral Mord and they were given six Hotchkiss twin machine gun mounts and two single 13.2-mm Browning machine guns at Cherbourg. Paris was ordered to Le Havre on 6 June to provide gunfire support on the Somme front and covered the evacuation of the town by the Allies, although the lack of spotting aircraft meant that she was not particularly effective in that role. Instead she helped to defend the harbour of Le Havre against German aircraft until she was hit by a bomb on 11 June. She sailed for Cherbourg that night for temporary repairs despite taking on of water per hour. She was transferred to Brest on 14 June and carried 2,800 men when that port was evacuated on 18 June.Whitley, pp. 38–9 In the wake of the Armistice, Paris was docked at Plymouth, England. On 3 July 1940, as part of Operation Catapult, British forces forcibly boarded her and she was used by the British as a depot ship and as a barracks ship by the Polish Navy for the rest of the war. On 21 August 1945, after the war had ended, Paris was towed to Brest where she continued in her role as a depot ship.Whitley, p. 39 She was sold for scrap on 21 December 1955 and broken up at La Seyne from June 1956.Dumas, p. 231 FootnotesBibliography   * * Further reading * Category:Courbet-class battleships Category:World War I battleships of France Category:World War II battleships of France Category:Ships of the Free French Naval Forces Category:1912 ships Category:Maritime incidents in 1922 Category:Maritime incidents in July 1940 ","title":"French battleship Paris"},{"id":"1889426","text":"Kiss Kiss Bang Bang is a 2005 American black comedy crime film written and directed by Shane Black (in his directorial debut), and starring Robert Downey Jr., Val Kilmer, Michelle Monaghan, and Corbin Bernsen. The script is partially based on the Brett Halliday novel Bodies Are Where You Find Them, and interprets the classic hardboiled literary genre in a tongue-in-cheek fashion. The film was produced by Joel Silver, with Susan Levin and Steve Richards as executive producers. Shot in Los Angeles between February 24 and May 3, 2004, the film debuted at the 2005 Cannes Film Festival on May 14, 2005, and was released in the United States on October 21, 2005. It received positive reviews from critics, and grossed $15 million worldwide. Plot At a Los Angeles party, Harold \\"Harry\\" Lockhart recounts recent events. Fleeing a botched burglary in New York City, Harry's friend is shot, forcing Harry to evade police by ducking into an audition. Harry unintentionally impresses Dabney Shaw with an outburst of remorse Dabney mistakes for method acting; Dabney takes Harry to Los Angeles to screen test for the role of a private investigator. At a Hollywood party, Harry meets \\"Gay\\" Perry van Shrike, an openly gay private investigator, hired to give Harry on-the-job experience for his role. Party host Harlan Dexter is a retired actor who recently resolved a feud over his wife's inheritance with his long-lost daughter, Veronica. Harry also encounters his childhood crush Harmony Lane, but wakes up in bed with her hostile friend. During a stakeout at a Big Bear Lake cabin, Perry and Harry witness a car being dumped in the lake and are spotted by two thugs. Perry realizes there's someone in the trunk and shoots the lock in a rescue attempt, but accidentally hits the female corpse inside. They cannot report the body because it will appear Perry killed her. Harmony contacts Harry, explaining that her sister Jenna came to Los Angeles, used Harmony's credit cards, then supposedly killed herself. Believing Harry is a detective, Harmony asks him to investigate Jenna's death. After Harmony leaves, Harry discovers the lake corpse in his bathroom. Harry and Perry dump the corpse, later identified as Veronica Dexter by police. Harry discovers it was Harmony's credit card that was used to hire Perry to come to the lake, tying Jenna to their case. He goes to see Harmony, who accidentally slams the door on his finger, cutting it off. At a party where Harmony is working, the thugs from the lake (Mr. Frying Pan and Mr. Fire) beat Harry and order him to cease the investigation. While taking Harry to the hospital, Harmony sees the thugs heading to Perry's latest stakeout. Realizing that Perry is heading into a trap, she leaves Harry in her car and runs off to warn Perry, with Frying Pan being killed by an armed food- cart operator. A pink-haired girl, affiliated with the thugs, steals Harmony's car and unwittingly drives an unconscious (on pain-killers) Harry to her house. Mr. Fire arrives and kills her; Harry recovers the gun and kills Mr. Fire. Harmony meets Harry at his hotel where she reveals she had told Jenna, years ago, that Harlan Dexter was her real father, to hopefully diminish the pain of their sexually abusive father. They end up in bed, but just before anything can happen, Harmony reveals she had once slept with Harry's best friend, and he throws her out. After Harmony disappears following a lead, Harry and Perry investigate a private mental hospital owned by Harlan. Perry realizes Veronica was incarcerated there by Harlan so an impostor could end the inheritance feud. Harry unintentionally kills a murderous orderly, but they are captured by Harlan, who reveals that he plans to cremate his daughter's corpse to remove any remaining evidence. Harry calls Harmony, who had not actually disappeared, but had simply gone to work. Harmony steals the van containing the corpse. Harry and Perry escape, but Harmony crashes the van. A shootout ensues, in which Perry and Harry are shot by the same bullet; Harry then manages to kill Dexter and his three thugs. Waking in a hospital, Harry finds that Perry survived and Harmony is fine. Perry reveals that Jenna did commit suicide. Jenna had located Harlan, believing him to be her real father. She accidentally witnessed him having sex with Veronica's impostor, Pink Hair Girl. Believing her new \\"father\\" was also incestuous, Jenna commissioned Perry to catch him in the act, then committed suicide. Perry travels back to Harmony's hometown and slaps around her father, who is now bed-ridden and helpless, belittling him for being a \\"big tough guy\\" when he abused the equally helpless Jenna. Harry finishes his narration by stating that he is wrapping up the movie, now works for Perry, and thanks the viewers for watching.

Following the example of James L. Brooks, Black attempted to make a romantic comedy, \\"a quirky story of two kids in L.A.\\". Brooks liked Black's first draft, but felt his later attempts were losing focus. Trying to salvage what he had liked, Brooks suggested Black imagine Jack Nicholson from As Good as It Gets playing Nicholson's role from Chinatown. This led Black to add action elements - \\"I said, you know, 'Fuck it. I have to put a murder in it.'\\" - and re-work the screenplay, adding the character of detective \\"Gay\\" Perry, who Black said was an attempt to break stereotypes, as he had never seen \\"the gay guy who kicks down the door, shoots everyone, and bails your ass out before\\". Old detective novels were a major influence, with Black saying he tried to re-invent the genre \\"using realistic characters, in a modern setting, but with the spirit of the 1950s and 1960s\\". The crime plot drew from Brett Halliday's Bodies Are Where You Find Them, and Black homaged Raymond Chandler by splitting the film into chapters named after Chandler's books.Shane Black on Kiss Kiss Bang Bang The script, then titled You'll Never Die in This Town Again, was rejected by various studios before Joel Silver, who gave Black his first break producing Lethal Weapon and The Last Boy Scout, decided to help him. The leading role of the now retitled L.A.P.I. had been considered for Benicio del Toro, Hugh Grant and Johnny Knoxville. Robert Downey, Jr. learned about the film from his then-girlfriend Susan Levin, who worked as Silver's assistant, and as he finished working with Silver in Gothika, the producer and Black brought him in to audition. Downey was eventually cast as they liked his readings and knew he could fit into the small $15 million budget, as his career had been in a downfall following his time in prison. Levin also suggested bringing in Val Kilmer, who coincidentally had been long interested in making a comedy. Before principal photography begun, the title became Kiss Kiss Bang Bang because Black felt it was a \\"blunt and austere title\\" that described how the plot was \\"half romantic comedy and half murder mystery\\". To achieve a neo-noir look, Black screened 1960s films of the genre, such as Harper and Point Blank, to cinematographer Michael Barrett and production designer Aaron Osborne. Osborne in particular drew inspiration from the detective book covers by illustrator Robert McGuinness, who was also brought in to draw the covers for the fictional Johnny Gossamer novels that appear in the film. The Hollywood party that opens the film was filmed in Black's own Los Angeles mansion. Release Kiss Kiss Bang Bang was screened out of competition at the 2005 Cannes Film Festival. The film's premiere happened at the Chinese Theatre on October 17, as the opener of the Hollywood Film Festival. Kiss Kiss Bang Bang was released on DVD June 13, 2006. Box office The film opened on October 21 in the United States, with a limited release. From its release until mid-November, the film's distribution increased every weekend due to its favorable critical reviews. It stayed in release in the United States until early January. The film earned a total of $4,243,756 in the United States. Kiss Kiss Bang Bang grossed far more outside the United States, accounting for just over 70% of the film's worldwide gross, accumulating $11,541,392. The film ended up earning $15,785,148 worldwide, earning back its budget. Downey was disappointed at the low box office intake, but said Kiss Kiss Bang Bang \\"ended up being my calling card to Iron Man\\", as his performance attracted director Jon Favreau. That film marked Downey's career resurrection, and Black would even be brought in to co-write and direct the sequel Iron Man 3. Critical response On Rotten Tomatoes, the film has an approval rating of 86%, based on 180 reviews, and an average rating of 7.46/10. The website's critical consensus reads: \\"Tongue-in-cheek satire blends well with entertaining action and spot-on performances in this dark, eclectic neo-noir homage.\\" On Metacritic, the film has a weighted average score 72 out of 100, based on 37 critic reviews, indicating \\"generally favorable reviews\\". Mike Russell of The Oregonian observed that \\"This is one of Downey's most enjoyable performances, and one of Kilmer's funniest. It's a relationship comedy wrapped in sharp talk and gunplay, a triumphant comeback for Black, and one of the year's best movies\\". Jeff Otto, an IGN critic, wrote that, \\"It takes a bunch of genres and twists them into a blender, a pop relic that still feels current ... one of the best times I've had at the movies this year.\\" Kirk Honeycutt of The Hollywood Reporter praised the lead performances \\"Downey and Monaghan are wonderful at playing characters that compensate for the harshness of their past with flippant swaggers.\\" Todd McCarthy of Variety magazine wrote: \\"Once again making a diverting but insubstantial movie look better than it is, Downey, with haggard charm to burn, is winning all the way. Kilmer is riotous at times as an impeccably groomed, businesslike guy keen to assert his orientation at every opportunity.\\" Roger Ebert of the Chicago Sun-Times gave the film 3 out of 4 stars. Ebert wrote that the film \\"contains a lot of comedy and invention, but doesn't much benefit from its clever style. The characters and plot are so promising that maybe Black should have backed off and told the story deadpan, instead of mugging so shamelessly for laughs.\\" Of the film, Robert Downey Jr. said \\"Kiss Kiss Bang Bang, which is, I think, in some ways the best film I've ever done.\\" It was named \\"Overlooked Film of the Year\\" by the 2005 Phoenix Film Critics Society. Empire magazine named it \\"Best Thriller\\". Soundtrack The soundtrack to Kiss Kiss Bang Bang with music by John Ottman was released on October 18, 2005.

Although welcomed by some, the message also has been cited as an example of poor usability in computer user interfaces. Background In CP/M, attempting to read a floppy disk drive with the door open would hang until a disk was inserted and the disk drive door was closed (very early disk hardware did not send any kind of signal until a disk was spinning, and a timeout to detect the lack of signal required too much code on these tiny systems). Many users of CP/M became accustomed to this as a method of managing multiple disks, by opening the disk drive to stop a program from reading or writing a file until the correct disk could be inserted. A primary design consideration for PC DOS was that software written for CP/M be portable to DOS without changes. Even the first IBM PC had hardware that told the operating system that the disk drive door was open, but returning an error to software trying to read the disk would break the ability to manage disks this way without such changes. Still, it was desirable to improve the experience, in particular by giving the user a way to get out of the hang without having to find a disk to insert in the drive. The prompt was invented for this reason. Description A missing disk (or disk drive door opened) was defined by DOS as a \\"critical error\\" and would call the \\"critical error handler\\". The default \\"critical error handler\\" was part of COMMAND.COM and printed the \\"Abort, Retry, ...\\" prompt, then waited for user input. Other problems (in particular, a checksum error while reading data from a disk) were also defined as a \\"critical error\\", thus causing the prompt to appear for reasons other than a missing disk or opened disk drive. Users could press a key to indicate what they wanted to happen; available options included: * Abort (A): Terminate the operation or program, and return to the command prompt. In hindsight, this was not a good idea as the program would not do any cleanup (such as completing writing of other files). * Retry (R): Attempt the operation again. \\"Retry\\" was what the user did if they could fix the problem by inserting a disk and closing the disk drive door. On early hardware, retrying a disk read error would sometimes be successful, but as disk drives improved, this became far less likely. * Ignore (I): Return success status to the calling program or routine, despite the failure of the operation. This could be used for disk read errors, and DOS would return whatever data was in the read buffer (which might contain some of the correct data). \\"Ignore\\" did not appear for open drives or missing disks. * Fail (F): Starting with MS-DOS/PC DOS 3.3, \\"Fail\\" returned an error code to the program, similar to a \\"file not found\\" error. The program could then gracefully recover, perhaps asking the user for a different file name. This removed the biggest problem with the prompt (which earlier was known as \\"Abort, Retry, Ignore?\\") by providing an option that did not crash the program or repeat the prompt. A program could install its own \\"critical error handler\\" while running, and many of the more sophisticated programs (in particular full screen programs) did so in order to avoid the messages disturbing the display. Some programs faked the missing \\"Fail\\" response in DOS 2.0 by jumping back to the calling program, skipping the return stack in DOS. This was a risky hack as it relied on the stack layout and skipped cleanup operations in the operating system. Usability The error messages has been described as being an example of poor user interface design. For most users, if the message appeared, the only choice was to hit 'R'—which repeated the message—or hit another letter, which caused the program to crash and all work to be lost. One scholar described it this way: MS-DOS 6.22 contained a singular case where the only option was \\"(R) Retry\\": when flushing the hard disk write-behind cache could not be completed. The user may attempt to repeat the write until successful or power off the system. Modern systems Hard disks and larger removable media such as Zip drives made the need to manage multiple disks per drive obsolete, and thus made the prompt useless. It was gradually replaced with code that acted like \\"Fail\\" immediately. DOS 3.3 COMMAND.COM provided the startup option \`/F\` in order to force the default critical error handler to return \\"Fail\\" on all errors. Starting with version 4.0, the alternative command line processors 4DOS and NDOS supported \`/F\` and the corresponding \`CritFail=Yes\` directive in \`4DOS.INI\`/\`NDOS.INI\` as well. The option was also supported by the COMMAND.COM of PTS-DOS 6.51 and S/DOS 1.0, as well as by DR- DOS 7.02 and higher. OpenDOS 7.01, COMMAND.COM provides a similar feature with \`/N\` (described as \\"do not install a critical error handler\\") which is still supported in newer versions. Most other operating systems, such as Linux, always act like \\"Fail\\" in all cases. A screenshot of Wrong Volume dialog box on Windows 10. Windows 10 can still generate a similar prompt, although in a dialog box and with a more comprehensive error message. The choices are similar but renamed: \\"Cancel\\" (to the user this is similar to \\"Abort\\" but technically it is a \\"Fail\\" with a different error code), \\"Try Again\\" (instead of \\"Retry\\") and \\"Continue\\" (instead of \\"Fail\\"). This may be supported by the drivers for some removable media when a file is opened with a full volume name or the disk is removed while the file is open. However for mundane actions similar to what triggered the prompt in DOS, such as attempting to read \\"E:\\" when there is no disk in the CD drive, Windows produces an immediate \\"Fail\\". In popular culture Humorous variations of Edgar Allen Poe's The Raven using \\"Abort, Retry, Ignore?\\" in place of \\"nevermore\\" were written in the 1980s and 1990s and were quite popular, distributed by bulletin board and email. The original and best known version has been credited to Cleveland poet Marcus Bales. It has been adapted numerous times, attributed to Anonymous, Lucy Blades, Rob Collins, and others. In 1993, Neil Howe published 13th Gen: Abort, Retry, Ignore, Fail?, a sympathetic book about the culture of Generation X. In 1996, White Town released an EP entitled >Abort, Retry, Fail?_. PC Magazine has used the term as the title of its column highlighting humorous computer-related errors.

Renegade Renegade was formed in California in the early 1980s by Cardenas and the band's manager/producer Kim Richards and were unusual in being ethnic Hispanics playing rock music. Widely viewed as teen idols, the band headlined the Saturday nights of the Los Angeles Street Scene Festival in both 1985 and 1986, with audiences of 150,000 in attendance.Los Angeles Times http://renegadeusa.com/members/e107_plugins/wrap/wrap.php?10 They released four albums, Rock n' Roll Crazy, Renegade II – On the Run, Nuns on Wheels and Renegade Live, with their major success coming in California, Mexico and Japan. Renegade played around the world and at music festivals with bands such as 38 Special, Foreigner, Journey and Night Ranger, and in the late 1980s were asked by Kenny Rogers to appear on the Texas-New Mexico Border with Lionel Richie and Lee Greenwood to support Rogers' Hands Across America effort.See Career Highlights Press Articles http://renegadeusa.com/members/e107_plugins/wrap/wrap.php?10 In 1990, the band was featured in a 98-minute television special aired on MTV internationally, entitled Renegade MTV Special.https://www.imdb.com/title/tt1447505/ Renegade reformed in 2000 and was honored in August 2001 at a David Hasselhoff-hosted event at the Conga Room in Los Angeles for record sales in excess of 30 million units worldwide. Solo projects In 1986 Cardenas held the world record for having the world's largest drumkit, which he demonstrated on the Guinness Hall of Fame Awards TV show hosted by David Frost. The same year Cardenas released a solo album entitled Animal Instinct. The first single from the album was a cover of the Del Shannon song \\"Runaway\\" and became a hit in the US, peaking at number 83 on the Billboard Hot 100. The video for the single featured cameo appearances by Shannon and Donny Osmond and cost $500,000 to make, reputedly the most expensive video ever made for a single at the time. It won a nomination for Best Music Video, Short Form at the 29th Annual Grammy Awards. Cardenas followed \\"Runaway\\" with the self-penned \\"Hungry for Your Love\\", which featured Phyllis Diller and Cardenas's pet tiger Bundi in the video, but the single did not match the success of \\"Runaway\\". The album Animal Instinct was reissued on March 6, 2012, featuring bonus tracks and the videos for the singles. The re-release of Animal Instinct was due to precede the release of a new double album by Cardenas entitled Generations that was to include Cardenas's two sons Nick and Zach Cardenas and was planned for release later in 2012. However, in a press release sent out by Allied Artists on October 15, 2012, it was announced that the album \\"will not be distributed at this time, and no new date has been established\\".

From the late 1940s, during the Chinese Civil War, remnants of the Chinese National Revolutionary Army retreated to territory within Burma as the communists took over mainland China. Within the mountain region Kuomintang forces of the Eighth Army 237 division and 26th Army 93 division held their position for two decades in preparation for a counterattack towards mainland China. Under pressure from the United Nations, the counterattack was cancelled and the army was recalled to northern Thailand and later back to Taiwan; however, some troops decided to remain within Burma. East of the Salween river, indigenous tribal guerrilla groups exercised control with the support of the Communist Party of Burma. During the 1960s, the Communist Party of Burma lost its base of operations within central Burma, and with the assistance of the Chinese communists, expanded within the border regions in the northeast. Many intellectual youths from China joined the Communist Party of Burma, and these forces also absorbed many local guerrillas.佤邦歷史 , Wa State government The Burmese communists gained control over Pangkham, which became their base of operations. At the end of the 1980s, the ethnic minorities of northeast Burma became politically separated from the Communist Party of Burma. On 17 April 1989, Bao Youxiang's armed forces announced their separation from the Communist Party of Burma, and formed the United Myanmar Ethnicities Party, which later became the United Wa State Party. On 18 May, the United Wa State Army signed a ceasefire agreement with the State Law and Order Restoration Council, which replaced Ne Win's military regime following the 8888 Uprising.

Internally, Wa State administers 15 districts within its territory. Wa State's southern exclave is not part of traditional Wa territory, but was granted in 1989 by the then-ruling Burmese military junta for the UWSA's cooperation in their efforts against drug warlord Khun Sa. These territories were originally inhabited by the Austroasiatic Tai Loi peoples, but now include significant Lahu and Shan communities.  Geography and economy  Map of Wa State The region is mainly mountainous, with deep valleys. The lowest points are approximately 600 metres above sea level, with the highest mountains over 3000 metres. Initially Wa State was heavily reliant on opium production.Die Wa in Gefahr (German) With Chinese assistance, there has been a move towards growing rubber and tea plantations.

The UWSA cultivated vast areas of land for the opium poppy, which was later refined to heroin. Methamphetamine trafficking was also important to the economy of Wa State. The money from the opium was primarily used for purchasing weapons. In August 1990, government officials began drafting a plan to end drug production and trafficking in Wa State. According to an interview with Wa officials in 1994, Bao Youyi (Tax Kuad Rang; also known as Bao Youyu) became wanted by the Chinese police for his involvement in drug trafficking. As a result, Bao Youxiang and Zhao Nyi-Lai went to Cangyuan Va Autonomous County of China and signed the Cangyuan Agreement with local officials, which stated that, \\"No drugs will go into the international society (from Wa State); no drugs will go into China (from Wa State); no drugs will go into Burmese government-controlled areas (from Wa State).\\"China's dangerous neighbor Phoenix Weekly 2003 However, the agreement did not mention whether or not Wa State could sell drugs to insurgent groups. In 1997, the United Wa State Party officially proclaimed that Wa State would be drug-free by the end of 2005. With the help of the United Nations and the Chinese government, many opium farmers in Wa State shifted to the production of rubber and tea. However, some poppy farmers continued to cultivate the flower outside of Wa State.China’s Opium Substitution Policy in Burma and Laos - TransNational Institute Although the Burmese government has begun taking measures to decrease the production of such drugs, it is an arduous task due to corruption at high levels in the government and a lack of infrastructure to carry out operations.缅甸第二特区佤邦,一切好象是中国的一个延伸, 15 October 2011.

A sunshower is usually the result of accompanying winds associated with a rain storm sometimes miles away, blowing the airborne raindrops into an area where there are no clouds, therefore causing a sunshower. Sometimes a sunshower is created when a single rain shower cloud passes overhead, and the Sun's angle keeps the sunlight from being obstructed by overhead clouds. Sunshower conditions often lead to the appearance of a rainbow, if the sun is at a sufficiently low angle. Although used in the United States, Canada, Australia, New Zealand, Ireland and the UK, the term \\"sunshower\\" is rarely found in dictionaries. Additionally, the phenomenon has a wide range of sometimes remarkably similar folkloric names in cultures around the world. A common theme is that of clever animals and tricksters getting married or related to the devil, although many variations of this theme are in existence. Folkloric names creek in Austin, Texas. *In Afrikaans, this phenomenon, i.e. when it rains and the sun shines, the traditional belief is Jakkals trou met wolf se vrou, meaning 'Jackal marries wolf's wife'. *In Nigeria, when it rains and the sun is shining at the same time, people say that a Lion is/has giving/given birth. *In Albania, when it rains and the sun shines, people say that a romani wedding is taking place somewhere near. *In Morocco, Algeria and Tunisia, it is called \\" (Ar's A'Dib)\\" or \\"the wolf's wedding\\" *in Argentina, it is called El mono del casamiento de Mirtha Legrand (The monkey at the wedding of Mirtha Legrand). *In Bangladesh and West Bengal, India: \\"\\" \\"Khêkshialer biye\\" \\"Jackal's(or fox's) wedding\\" *In Basque: \\"Azeri besta\\" (\\"Fox feast\\") or \\"Azeri ezteia\\" (\\"Fox's wedding\\"): as the sun is shining, the chickens stay outside, but as it is also raining, they remain still, paralyzed by the rain; the fox seizes that occasion to eat them. *In Belgium, Flanders: the traditional belief is that of \\"Duiveltjeskermis\\" or \\"Devil's fair\\" *In Brazil, \\"\\" (fox's wedding), \\"\\", which is a rhyme that means \\"Sun and rain, widow's wedding/marriage\\" or \\"\\", which is a rhyme that means \\"Rain and Sun, Spanish man's wedding/marriage\\" (which is often used as a response to the first rhyme or vice versa). *In Bulgaria, there is a saying about a bear getting married. *In El Salvador, it is said that the deer is giving birth. *In Ethiopia and Eritrea, it is said that the hyena is giving birth. *In Finland, it is called \\"\\" or \\"foxes are taking bath\\" *In France, it is traditionally believed that \\"\\" or \\"the wolf's wedding\\", or \\"\\" is taking place *In Galician, the traditional belief is that the vixen or the fox are getting married: casa a raposa / casa o raposo; sometimes the wolf and the vixen: Estanse casando o lobo coa raposa. * A wide range of expressions are attested in the German-speaking countries, many of them historically, e.g. \\"There's a feast day in hell\\" (Oldenburg), \\"marriage [in hell]\\" (East Frisia), \\"funfair [in hell]\\" (Westphalia, Rhineland), the latter one attested already in 1630. Others are \\"They're baking in hell\\", \\"The devil is making pancakes\\" (Oldenburg), \\"Frau Holle hosts a funfair\\" (Lower Rhineland), \\"There's a marriage among the heathens/gypsies\\" (Switzerland), \\"The devil's dancing with his grandmother\\" (Winsen district, Lower Saxony), \\"The devil is marrying\\" (Schleswig-Holstein), \\"The devil is endowing his daughters\\" (Mecklenburg). Often, the phenomenon is interpreted as a struggle between rain and sunshine. \\"The devil is beating his wife/grandmother/mother-in-law\\" (Bavaria, Austria, Lunenburg), \\"The deviless gets beaten\\" (Eger country, Bohemia), \\"The devil is stabbing his wife with a sword\\" (Celle, Lower Saxony), \\"The devil has hanged his mother\\" (Moselle). The versions referring to the devil's wife (instead of grandmother etc) are the older ones. Praetorius (Blockes Berges Verrichtung, Leipzig 1668) mentions „Der Teufel schlägt seine Mutter, daß sie öl gibt“ (The devil is beating his wife so she will serve ale). In Schleswig-Holstein and Oldenburg, there's also: \\"The devil is bleaching his grandmother\\", as this usually involved repeated dampening of cloth in the sun – quite fitting for the weather phenomenon. Otherwise, idioms refer to witches. \\"The witches are dancing\\", \\"The old witch is making pancakes\\" (Schleswig-Holstein), \\"The witches are making butter\\" (Silesia), \\"The witches are being buried at the end of the world\\" (North Frisia). Although later on witches are often depicted as the devil's mistresses, not a single idiom about sunshowers shows them as such. Around the Baltic Sea, there are also references to sunshowers and \\"whore's children\\", i.e. illegitimate children: \\"Now a whore's child has been sired/baptised\\" (Mecklenburg). Similar expressions could be found in Finland. Furthermore there are humorous versions like: \\"A lieutenant is paying his debts\\" (Rhineland), \\"A nobleman goes to heaven\\" (Lunenburg), \\"A tailor goes to heaven\\" (Schleswig-Holstein, Upper Saxony), \\"The devil gets a lawyer's soul\\" (Oldenburg). Completely different in origin are \\"The wolf has fever/bellyache\\" or \\"Now the wolves are pissing\\" (Mecklenburg). *in Greece they say \\",\\" which means \\"Sun and rain, the poor are marrying. Sun and moon, the donkeys are marrying.\\" *In Hawaii, it is known as \\"ghost rain\\" or \\"liquid sunshine\\". *In Hungary, it is known as \\"veri az ördög a feleségét\\" which translates to \\"the devil is beating his wife\\". *In Iran it is known as \\"\\" which means \\"wolf giving birth\\". *In Italy they say \\", la gatta fa l'amore\\" which means \\"It rains with the sun, the (female) cat is making love\\". *In Jamaica, it is known as \\"The Devil and his wife are having a fight\\" This is significant of the two opposing elements: Sun Vs. Rain. *In Japan, it is known as \\"Kitsune no yomeiri\\", or \\"the fox's wedding.\\" *In Kenya, hyenas or monkeys are marrying. *In Korea, one common term is \\"fox rain\\" (여우비), referring to a legend about a tiger marrying a fox, causing a cloud, who loved the fox, to weep behind the sun. For this reason, the day of a sunshower is also called 호랑이 장가가는 날 \\"tiger's wedding day\\". *In the Mazandarani language, in north of Iran, it is also called \\"the jackal's wedding\\". *In Maldives, it is also \\"The rain that falls when a noble infidel dies\\". *In Malta it is known as \\"Twieled Tork\\" which translates to \\"A Turkish baby has been born\\". *In Tunisia and Morocco, it is the \\"wolf's wedding\\".

The company manufactured centrifugal radiators, carburetors, and micrometers, before branching into assist motors and bicycles. The moped originally created during World War II and mass- produced between 1946 and 1988 came in various iterations, whilst keeping the same concept of a motor with roller resting on the front wheel of a bicycle. Referred to the company's advertisement as the 'bicycle which drives itself' (« la bicyclette qui roule toute seule »), it became extremely popular with school children, students or plant workers because it was light and extremely economical. Ownership Owned successively by Dassault, Renault, Motobécane/MBK, VéloSoleX sold more than 7 million units worldwide before ceasing production in France in 1988. Production of the VéloSoleX restarted in both China and Hungary after 1988, but production ceased in Hungary in 2002. VéloSoleX is now manufactured in France. Blue 1986 VeloSolex Motobecane 3800. Black tricyclized 1967 VéloSolex. History The Solex motorized bicycle was conceived during World War II and marketed in 1946, with 8 million being sold between 1946 and 1988 in France and internationally, having been marketed in some 70 countries. The French design ceased production in 1988. It lived on for almost two decades as a licensed design produced in China and Hungary. Production returned to France in 2005, and the S4800 model was being marketed by VeloSolex America in North Bergen, New Jersey. Models and modifications * 1941: Prototype created of which only a few remain, based on a bicycle * 1946: A 45 cc model, of which many evolutions were made, with a 45 cc engine developing and no clutch, the engine has to be restarted every time the rider comes to a stop * 1953: Model 330 with a 49 cc engine and using the same frame as the 45 but boosting power * 1955: Model 660 with a new dedicated bicycle frame, but an unchanged engine * 1957: Model 1010 updates the engine * 1958: Model 1400 * 1959: Model 1700 uses the same frame as the previous version but introduce an automatic clutch and air cooling of the engine * 1961: Model S2200 with an engine which power is boosted to over the next three years to version will be produced V1 and V2 * 1964: Model S3300 with a new square tube frame which will remain the same until end of production, adds a drum brake on the rear wheel * 1966: Model S3800, which is the most common and most sold version of the brand over the years, later a Luxure or 'Luxe' version \\"S3800 luxe\\" and \\"S3800 super luxe\\" introduce color to the frame which was always black (including the motor) until then, as well as having large wheels with blackwall tires.

In popular culture  In the 1958 French comedy Mon Oncle, the main character Monsieur Hulot (Jacques Tati) is a day-dreaming and impractical uncle who, while perplexed by the cutting- edge lifestyle of his sister and brother-in-law, still maintains a VéloSoleX motorized bicycle as his main transportation. Primo Levi, in one of the autobiographic short stories in his collection The Periodic Table, mentions that he would be able switch from a bicycle to a VéloSoleX if he managed to conclude a business deal with a cosmetics manufacturer. In the 2007 film Mr. Bean's Holiday, the titular character attempts to hitchhike on an elderly man's VéloSoleX to get to Cannes, only to weigh the back of it down, and when the latter gets off to fix the problem, Mr Bean uses this as an opportunity to hijack the bike, but fails. In the 1975 Sydney Pollack thriller Three Days of the Condor, Robert Redford rides a Solex to work in New York which sets his character as an unassuming intellectual. He thwarts two youths who try to steal it.

It is owned and administered by the Society for Science & the Public, a 501(c)(3) non-profit organization based in Washington, D.C. Each May, more than 1500 students from roughly 70 countries and territories compete in the fair for scholarships, tuition grants, internships, scientific field trips and the grand prizes, including one $75,000 and two $50,000 college scholarships. All prizes together amount to over $4,070,000. Two awards ceremonies are held including: Special Awards Organization Presentation (which now includes the Government Awards Presentations) and the Grand Awards Ceremony. The International Science and Engineering Fair was founded in 1950 by Science Service (now the Society for Science & the Public) and was sponsored by the Intel Corporation from 1997 to 2019. Since 2020, Regeneron Pharmaceuticals is the title sponsor for ISEF, but the event that year was cancelled and replaced with an online version due to the COVID-19 pandemic.  Notable alumni  ISEF alumni include: * Richard Zare (1957): American chemist who won the National Medal of Science in 1983 * James Gunn (1957): Astronomer and MacArthur Fellow who won the National Medal of Science in 2008 * Paul Modrich (1964): American biochemist who won the Nobel Prize in Chemistry in 2015 * Susan Solomon (1972): Atmospheric chemist who won the National Medal of Science in 1999 * Kristina M.

These fairs usually encompass multiple states or entire regions of a country. The regional fair committee is responsible for managing the fair when their city hosts the event. Individual science projects and team science projects both compete for prizes. Teams are composed of two to as many as four high school students (grades 9-12). The structure of the competition is as follows: * Sunday: Arrival, project setup, fixing Display and Safety violations, and pin exchange * Monday: Continual arrival and setup, opening ceremony * Tuesday: Final project clearance * Wednesday: Awards judging over 3 sessions, with both scheduled and unscheduled interviews * Thursday: Public visitation day, special awards ceremony * Friday: Grand awards ceremony, project teardown Additionally, time is set aside for students to experience the host city, with ISEF coordinating signups for various tours and activities. A significant component of the program is social, as students interact with each other during mixers and ceremonies. Throughout much of the week, various seminars are also held for students, mentors, and teachers.  Prizes and honors  * Gordon E. Moore Award: $75,000 scholarship, given to the top of the Best of Category Award winners, selected on the basis of innovative research and potential of the project to have an impact in the particular field and the world as a whole. * Intel Foundation Young Scientist Award: $ 50,000 award presented by Intel and SSP to two Best in Category projects.

A prominent awardee was Josette Biyo. ISEF also used to hold a \\"People's Choice Award\\" to allow the public to vote for its favorite entries. Since 2001, MIT's Lincoln Laboratory has named asteroids after ISEF winners as part of the Ceres Connection. Multiple organizations sponsor 'special awards' with their own distinct criteria. These organizations include the National Security Agency, Association for Computing Machinery, IEEE Foundation, and Patent and Trademark Office Society. Finalist Medal The Intel ISEF Finalist Medal is given to about 1800 students from 75 countries each year, which are participating at the Intel International Science and Engineering Fair, which is owned and administered by the Society for Science and the Public, a 501(c)(3) non-profit organization based in Washington, DC. Each year about 7 million students participate in different regional, district and state ISEF affiliated fairs. Some of the winners of these affiliated fairs, which exist in over 75 countries, get the chance to take part at the Intel ISEF as a finalist, and each of them is awarded the Intel ISEF Finalist Medal. In 2013 there were 1611 finalists at the Intel ISEF in Phoenix, Arizona. The medal has a diameter of 48 mm and is golden galvanized. The obverse shows the official logo of the Intel ISEF, the reverse shows the year of participating and the location of that year's Intel ISEF. The ribbon bar is blue with a width of 40 mm and has a golden romanic 1 in the middle.

History The aqueduct was designed by civil engineer Thomas Telford for the Ellesmere Canal. The resident engineer was M. Davidson who also acted as resident engineer on a number of Telford's other works. The foundation stone was laid on 17 June 1796 and it was completed in 1801. It has a cast iron trough within which the water is contained. The masonry walls hide the cast iron interior. The aqueduct followed Telford's innovative Longdon-on-Tern Aqueduct on the Shrewsbury Canal, and was a forerunner of the Pontcysyllte Aqueduct, also on the Llangollen Canal. The aqueduct was briefly the tallest navigable one ever built, and it now is Grade II* listed in both England and Wales. It forms part of the Pontcysyllte Aqueduct World Heritage Site. Description Looking towards Wales along the aqueduct. The entrance to the Chirk Tunnel is visible behind it. Looking towards England along the aqueduct The aqueduct consists of ten arches, each with a span of . The water level is above the ground and above the River Ceiriog. The stone work is yellow sandstone. William Hazledine provided the ironwork for the aqueduct. Originally built with iron plates only at the base of the trough, iron side plates were added to the aqueduct in 1870 to alleviate leakage. The Chirk Tunnel starts at the north end of the Chirk Aqueduct, allowing the canal to continue on towards Llangollen. A railway viaduct was built later alongside the aqueduct. It is slightly higher than the aqueduct.

It spans the time between 5.332 ± 0.005 Ma and 3.6 ± 0.005 Ma (million years ago). It is preceded by the Messinian age of the Miocene epoch, and followed by the Piacenzian age. The Zanclean can be correlated with regionally used stages, such as the Tabianian or Dacian of Central Europe. It also corresponds to the late Hemphillian to mid-Blancan North American Land Mammal Ages. In California, the Zanclean roughly corresponds to the mid- Delmontian Californian Stage of from 7.5 To 2.9 Ma ago. Definition The Zanclean stage was introduced by Giuseppe Seguenza in 1868. It is named after Zancle, the pre-Roman name for the Italian city of Messina on Sicily. The base of the Zanclean (and the Pliocene series) lies with the top of magnetic chronozone Cr3 (about 100,000 years before the Thvera normal subchronozone C3n.4n). The base is also close to the extinction level of the calcareous nanoplankton species Triquetrorhabdulus rugosus (the base of biozone CN10b) and the first appearance of nanoplankton Ceratolithus acutus. The GSSP for the Zanclean is in the vicinity of the ruins of the ancient city of Heraclea Minoa on Sicily, Italy.Van Couvering et al. (2000) The top of the Zanclean stage (the base of the Piacenzian stage) is at the base of magnetic chronozone C2An (the base of the Gauss chronozone and at the extinction of the planktonic forams Globorotalia margaritae and Pulleniatina primalis.

Frankfurt: Africa Magna Verlag.Breunig, Peter, Kahlheber, Stefanie, and Rupp, Nicole. Exploring the Nok enigma. In: Antiquity Vol 82 Issue 316 June 2008 Origin Breunig and Rupp hypothesized, \\"Their origin is unknown, but since the plants they used as crops (especially millet) are indigenous to the Sahel region, a northern homeland is more probable than any other.\\" Breunig explains: \\"The people of the Nok Culture must have come from somewhere else. So far, however, we have not found out what region, though we suspect the Sahel zone in West Africa.\\" Sculptures The function of Nok terracotta sculptures is still unknown. For the most part, the terracotta is preserved in the form of scattered fragments. That is why Nok art is well known today only for the heads, both male and female, whose hairstyles are particularly detailed and refined. The statues are in fragments because the discoveries are usually made from alluvial mud, in terrain made by the erosion of water. The terracotta statues found there are hidden, rolled, polished, and broken. Rarely are works of great size conserved intact making them highly valued on the international art market. The terracotta figures are hollow, coil built, nearly life sized human heads and bodies that are depicted with highly stylized features, abundant jewelry, and varied postures. Little is known of the original function of the pieces, but theories include ancestor portrayal, grave markers, and charms to prevent crop failure, infertility, and illness. Also, based on the dome-shaped bases found on several figures, they could have been used as finials for the roofs of ancient structures. Margaret Young- Sanchez, Associate Curator of Art of the Americas, Africa, and Oceania in The Cleveland Museum of Art, explains that most Nok ceramics were shaped by hand from coarse-grained clay and subtractively sculpted in a manner that suggests an influence from wood carving. After some drying, the sculptures were covered with slip and burnished to produce a smooth, glossy surface. The figures are hollow, with several openings to facilitate thorough drying and firing. The firing process most likely resembled that used today in Nigeria, in which the pieces are covered with grass, twigs, and leaves and burned for several hours. As a result of natural erosion and deposition, Nok terracottas were scattered at various depths throughout the Sahel grasslands, causing difficulty in the dating and classification of the mysterious artifacts. Luckily, two archaeological sites, Samun Dukiya and Taruga, were found containing Nok art that had remained unmoved. Radiocarbon and thermo-luminescence tests dated the sculptures to a range of dates between about 2,900 and 2,000 years ago, making them some of the oldest in Western Africa. Many further dates were retrieved in the course of new archaeological excavations, extending the beginnings of the Nok tradition even further back in time. Because of the similarities between the two sites, archaeologist Graham Connah believes that \\"Nok artwork represents a style that was adopted by a range of iron-using farming societies of varying cultures, rather than being the diagnostic feature of a particular human group as has often been claimed.\\" Discovery The first Nok terracotta was discovered in 1928 by Colonel Dent Young, a co-owner of a mining partnership, near the village of Nok in Kaduna State, Nigeria.Chesi, G. & Merzeder, G. (2006). The Nok Culture: Art in Nigeria 2500 Years Ago The terracotta was accidentally unearthed at a level of from an alluvial tin mine. Young presented the sculptures to the Museum of the Department of Mines in Jos.Shaw, Thurstan. 1981. The Nok sculptures of Nigeria. Scientific American 244(2): 154–166. Fifteen years later, in 1943 near the village of Nok, in the center of Nigeria, a new series of clay figurines were discovered by accident while mining tin. A clerk in charge of the mine had found a head and had taken it back to his home for use as a scarecrow, a role that it filled (successfully) for a year in a yam field. This scarecrow was eventually noticed by Bernard Fagg who at the time was an administrative officer who had studied archaeology at the University of Cambridge. Fagg noticed that the head on the scarecrow looked similar to the sculpture that Young had found. He traveled to Jos where Young showed Fagg other recently uncovered terracotta figures. Eventually it became clear that the tin mining in Nok and Jema'a areas was revealing and destroying archaeological material. Preliminary archaeology Preliminary excavations at the beginning of January 1961 began near a remote valley named Taruga near the village of Takushara. The trial excavations took place during a period of eight days. The finds included objects of wrought iron, a quantity of iron slag, fragments of tuyere, pottery, figurine fragments, red ocher, quartz hammer-stones, and small concentrations of charcoal. The most famous finds at the site were the pottery graters which were shallow, flat-bottomed dishes which were deeply scored inside with diced patterns to produce a sharp abrasive surface. These pottery graters were probably used for food preparation. In the preliminary excavation a proton magnetometer survey was used to try and locate furnaces. The survey revealed a total of 61 magnetic anomalies which were mostly located in a flat, central area which probably indicated the limits of actual occupation. Twenty of the anomalies revealed concentrations of slag and nine of them contained in situ structures of furnace walls and bases. The most common type of artefact found was domestic pottery which can be divided into two different types. One type are bowls or shallow basins without lips and the other are globular pots which have averted lips. Because of this preliminary excavation, the Nok Culture would start being regarded as belonging to the Iron Age. Archaeology In 1989, German scientists were working in northeastern Nigeria's Chad Basin as part of a cooperative project between the University of Maiduguri located in Borno State, Nigeria, and archaeologists of Goethe University Frankfurt. This project examined the beginnings of sedentary farming societies in the Chad Basin. Questions arose about whether there were other societies like those in the Chad Basin, and these questions led the team to investigate the Nok Culture. In the early steps of the Frankfurt Nok Project, researchers had difficulty finding sites to excavate. The team began collaborating with Umaru Yusuf Potiskum and they started finding distinct Nok culture sites, although most were looted.Breunig, Peter (editor). 2014. Nok: African sculpture in archaeological context. Africa Magna Verlag, Germany, October 15. A few sites, however, were still intact, and artefacts found at these sites are described below. Stone tools The shapes of stone tools found at Nok sites change little throughout the entire span of the Nok Culture. What tends to strike researchers is a lack of cutting tools. Apart from stone axes, no tools with a cutting edge have been found. Projectile points made of either iron or stone are also absent from Nok sites. Grinding tools are very common at Nok sites. They are rarely preserved in one piece, but can still illustrate the different shapes and sizes of tools used throughout the Nok Culture. Grinding stones were made of quartzite, granitic, or metamorphic rock. At the site of Ungwar Kura, grinding stones seem to have been placed in a certain order, and at the site of Ido huge grinding slabs were arranged in an upright position with pots and stone beads next to them. This context is assumed to have been ritual in some way. Most of the grinders are merely hand-sized. Throughout Nok sites, there is an abundance of grinding slabs but there seems to be a low number of hand stones. It is possible that members of the Nok Culture used these grinders until they reached a certain state of wear, and then repurposed them as pestles. Ground stone axes were another tool commonly used by the Nok. They were typically made from fine- grained volcanic rock (siliceous rock is also sometimes seen), and may have been used in food preparation. These ax blades tend to be smallish in size, the largest reaching 20 centimeters. Stone balls are found at almost every Nok site and are approximately palm-sized. They were probably used as hammerstones or for roughening the surface of a grinding stone. Not all of them are ball shaped, however, and many have chipping marks all over or at least in one place. These stone balls likely would have served as mobile grinding stones. Stone rings have also been found at Nok Culture sites. They are normally found as fragments but can be identified as rings because of their flat, oval or triangular cross-sections and their shapes. These stone rings are very rare and their purpose is unknown. Another rare find is stone beads, which are typically found as if strung on strings. Beads tend to be carefully made out of hard siliceous rock such as quartz, chalcedony, jasper, or carnelian. There are three different bead shapes: cylindrical, which is the most common shape, as well as rod and ring-shaped. Ceramics Potsherds (pottery shards) are the most abundant archaeological artifacts at Nok sites. Since 2009, excavated pottery has been undergoing systematic analysis with a central aim to try and establish a chronology. Certain attributes of the pottery such as decoration, shape, and size appear with an increasing frequency and then disappear, being replaced with different pottery attributes. This change can sometimes allow one to divide the progression into different intervals based on the different attributes. In total approximately 90,000 potsherds have been collected, of which 15,000 have been considered diagnostic, meaning that they are decorated, sherds from the rim or the bottom of the vessel, or they have handles or holes in them. The results of the pottery analysis can be delineated into three distinct time periods: Early, Middle, and Late. =Early Nok Period ceramics= From approximately c. 1500–900 BC the pottery of the Early Nok Period are mostly small and not very well preserved. They seem to be richly decorated with various elaborate patterns directly below the vessels' rims and covering a large part of the ceramic body. The lines made on the pottery seem to be remarkably fine or curving lines. There tend to be many lines that are close together and some even have crisscrossing lines beneath the rim. Pottery frequently had everted and broad, thick rims. =Middle Nok Period ceramics= The Middle Nok Period is approximately from c. 900–300 BC and in this time period there is a dramatic increase of sites, terracotta fragments and iron objects. Instead of the early period's decoration, which tended to cover most of the pot, instead, there is a decorative band which is bordered by deep horizontal lines. This band appears on the pots' upper half or directly under the rim of the bowls. Some bands have a sharp ends as well as impressed zigzag lines or an incised wave or arc. Unlike the Early Nok period the Middle Nok ceramics tend to have more variety in the rim with everted rims, open bowls, bowls with inverted rims and incised line ornaments on the rims' lips. =Late Nok Period ceramics= The Late Nok period is from approximately c. 300–1 BC and has only a few known sites. There is little pottery available for analysis but from the pottery that was found there is a decrease in the strictness of the ornamental band. While bands are still used, they are more complexly decorated with additional patterning. There also tends to be a returning pattern of body decoration. The variety of rim sizes and types seem to be increasing even more than in the Middle Nok period. FarmingGrains= At almost all Nok sites, there are charred plant remains consisting of firewood and plant material for cooking. Remains of pearl millet, one of Africa's oldest grain crops, are commonly found. Pearl millet is highly productive and resistant to adverse growing conditions, including drought. Cowpeas, valued for their high protein content, are also found at some sites. So far, pearl millet and cowpeas are the only crops known to have been cultivated by the Nok people. It is unclear whether they ate or farmed tubers of any kind. The numerous grinding stones found at Nok sites suggest that the grains were ground into flour and made into a type of porridge. =Fruit= Hard pits from wild fruits have been found at many Nok sites. At some sites, fruit and seeds of other wild plants such as grasses and legumes were discovered. Overall there is not a huge selection of plant remains, but this could simply mean they were not preserved. =Trees and farming= The Nok people probably used an agroforestry system, combining cultivated crops with useful trees on the same plot of land. These plots are ecologically sustainable and inter-cropping of trees and several cultivated plant species were common from the savannas to the rain forest, with the origins of the practice going back to the first millennium BC, right at the time of the Nok culture. Most West African trees are not domesticated but are part of the wild vegetation which is left after farmers clear their fields of their crops. Because they are left to grow they multiply naturally without needing to be planted. Trees can produce food, medicine and animal feed. =Animals= Because of the acidic soil, no animal bones from the Nok culture have been preserved, leaving no direct evidence of what species they might have domesticated (or hunted). The only evidence for animals during the Nok culture period is the depictions of animals as figurines or terracotta sculptures.  Looting and repatriation  Since the 1970s, Nok terracotta figures have been heavily looted. Even larger-scale looting commenced in the Nok cultural area in 1994, and by 1995 two main local traders emerged. Each of the main traders could employ approximately 1,000 diggers to unearth terracottas every day. Although the majority of the terracottas were fragmented, some were intact and sellable.Brodie, Neil, and Donna Yates. 2012. Nok Terracottas. Trafficking Culture: Researching the Global Traffic in Looted Cultural Objects. Because of this, hundreds of Nok Culture sites have been illegally dug in search of these terracotta sculptures. Valuable information about the Nok Culture is lost when these objects are taken from out of the ground and removed from their archaeological contexts. In 1979, Nigeria's National Commission of Museums and Monuments Decree established the National Commission for Museums and Monuments (NCMM), which is used to manage Nigeria's cultural heritage. NCMM Decree number 77 made it illegal for anyone other than authorized personnel to buy or sell antiquities within Nigeria or export an antiquity without a permit from the NCMM. Towards the end of the 1990s the federal government of Nigeria implemented the NCMM, which initiated a series of actions to work out strategies for combating the problems of looting and to map out a plan of action. The general consensus was that laws governing antiquities and penalties for offenders needed to be strictly enforced and that all archaeological sites should be monitored. The NCMM also recommended more aggressive public enlightenment campaigns as well as a series of sensitization programs across the nation. These programs are considered a success in terms of increased awareness by law enforcement agents, as well as the Nigerian customs authorities and Interpol. However, not all of the recommendations were implemented, because the Nigerian government did not have the resources to face the large scale of some of the challenges. For example, the government did not have the resources to place monitors at all archaeological sites, and terracotta figures still slip through Nigeria's borders. Today, the terracotta sculptures are very highly sought after on the international art market, and so artifacts continue to be dug up without documentation of the contexts in which they were buried. A lack of extensive archaeological study has also severely limited our understanding of the Nok cultures.Department of the Arts of Africa, Oceania, and the Americas. 2000. Nok Terracotta (500 B.C.–200 A.D.). The Met’s Heilbrunn Timeline of Art History.Anon. 2015. Research continues into 3000 year-old Nok culture of sub- Saharan Africa. Adventures in Archaeology. Archaeology News from Past Horizons, February 8. A joint research project with Goethe University and the National Commission for Museums and Monuments conducted since 2005 showed that more than 90% of Nok Culture sites known in the research area have been illegally looted. Art historical studies carried out shows that over 1,000 Nok terracotta sculptures have been illegally excavated and smuggled into Europe, the USA, Japan, and elsewhere. In February 2013, Daily Trust reported that the Nigerian Ministry of Tourism, Culture, and National Orientation repossessed five Nok statuettes looted by a French thief in August 2010. The pieces had been seized by French customs agents and were repatriated following a Nigerian Government Directive.Mustapha Suleiman (February 3, 2013), France Hands Over Stolen Nigerian Artifacts Daily Trust. What further complicates the problem are the many workshops which fake Nok sculptures and then put them on the market as authentic.

The outfit has claimed responsibility of carrying out multiple terror attacks in India. It has been designated as a terrorist group by the European Union, India, and the United States. ; See also  * It remains a lawful organisation in Pakistan. It has right winged Islamic ideology. Founded by Muhammad Ahsan Dar in September 1989, it is considered one of the most important players that evolved the narrative of the Kashmir conflict from nationalism to the religious lines of radical jihad. The outfit is said to be supported, since its inception, by the Pakistani intelligence agency, ISI. Some authors view it as the military wing of Jamaat-e-Islami. Its headquarters are located in Muzaffarabad in Pakistan administered Kashmir and a liaison office is maintained in Islamabad. Foundation In 1988, Muhammad Ahsan Dar, a Jamaat-e-Islami school teacher, chose to cross the Line of Control to Pakistan-administered Kashmir. Trained in Pakistan, he returned to Indian- administered Jammu and Kashmir to establish a hard-line struggle against the Indian administration. He was joined by Mohammed Abdullah Bangroo, another Jamaat militant veteran, in the role of military advisor and in around April 1990, the Hizb-ul-Mujahideen was established. By 1990, the organisation asserted a strength over 10,000 armed cadres, most of whom were trained across the border. Many were trained in Afghanistan, too. Heavily critical of all other actors who accepted independence as a third option in the Kashmir conflict, the group solely advocated for an outright integration of Kashmir with Pakistan. Paul Staniland notes that the organisation primarily mobilised through the Jamaat-e-Islami network but initially represented a minority politico-religious ideology of theirs'.  Early days  The organisation's first major strike is deemed to be the assassination of Maulvi Farooq, the then Mirwaiz of Kashmir and chairman of the All Jammu and Kashmir Awami Action Committee, a coalition of disparate political parties in Jammu and Kashmir, on 21 May 1990. 21 people were killed in the clashes that ensued. The group gradually sought for a greater control of the socio-economic sphere of Kashmir and in June 1990 asked farmers to abstain from exporting their produce through \\"Hindu middlemen\\" in order to severe the link between the \\"local rich class\\" and their counterparts in the Indian state. On 27 October 1990, the organisation adopted a resolution supporting the merger of Jammu and Kashmir with Pakistan. The group grew and units were set up at the Jammu province by February 1991. Field intelligence units were also set up across different places. Cadre was extensively mobilised in the name of Islam The establishment of the Supreme Advisory Council followed by a student wing took place in spring 1991. The latter though became a separate organisation in its entirety, in June 1991, under the leadership of Nasir-ul-Islam, after it organised the kidnapping of a high-profile bureaucrat. After a 1991 merger with Tahreek-e- Jihad-e-Islami (TJI), which was backed by Jaamat, Hizb-ul-Mujahideen gained significant military might and its strength reached about 10,000 fighters. By the end of March 1991, HuM demanded that the local government provides the list of all permanent residence certificates and that all non-residents leave the state within one month. Insurgency decade= Friction with JKLF and alliance with Jaamat  The first three years of the insurgency (1990–92) were dominated by the Jammu Kashmir Liberation Front (JKLF). Despite being supported by Pakistan, they under the renewed ideology of their new leaders shifted to a secular pro-independence stance and attracted huge support in the valley in their strategy to organize a mass-resistance, that would compel India to withdraw from Kashmir. But, a lack of social fabric among the new mass-recruits, (who often did not share a common ideology) coupled with an urban-centric focus led to the gradual weakening of JKLF Indian counter- insurgency operations removed much of its leadership, wiping out its central control. Pakistan was also heavily incentivized by the popularization of Jihadi sentiments in the Kashmiri youth; and utilized the situation to gain control over Kashmir. By 1991, ISI had begun to cease providing of funds to JKLF, (which stood its ground for independence of the territory) and were instead advocating splinter factions to break off and form their own militant groups after receiving due training in their territory. Subsequently, Hizbul Mujahideen came to be favored by the ISI as a potentially valuable resource and finally, after JKLF rejected certain demands of nuancing their pro- independence stance; all of their erstwhile camps in Azad Kashmir were handed over to Hizbul. Jamaat also scoped the opportunity and choose to infiltrate Hizbul from within, by installing loyal members at key central positions. Numerous jihadi factions too departed from JKLF and were subsumed within Hizbul. Soon enough, arrests by Indian forces necessitated a re-organisation of the central command and in the reshuffle, Ahsan Dhar, a moderatist leader with an independent mind was asked to step down and Sayeed Salahudeen, a radical Jamaat loyalist, was appointed instead. Dar was soon expelled by Salahudeen loyalists in late 1991 and formed a splinter group-- \\"Muslim Mujahideen\\", which quickly fell apart after his arrest in 1993. An overall restructuring to enable a collective, hiearchical and institutionalized leadership along the lines of Jaamat soon followed which lend a much-needed organisational strength that lacked JKLF. Hizbul also managed to increase their penetration into the rural belt courtesy the utilization of Jaamat's socio-religious authority and homogeneity. An implementation of Sunni culture in the ground-roots helped their cause further. In the meanwhile, Hizb-ul Mujahideen rigidly opposed JKLF, all throughout and had rejected JKLF's nationalist agenda in favor of an Islamist one. There were increasing clashes with one another and the differences reached their peak by 1991, as it publicly opposed JKLF's agreement to a solution of the dispute without the aid of UN resolutions. Military clashes between JKLF and Hizbul became increasingly commonplace after the first such incident in April, 1991 wherein a JKLF area commander was killed. It began to systematically target members of JKLF, killing them and intimidating others to defect. JKLF leaders had alleged HM militants to be informers for the Indian forces and Amanullah Khan even complained of his cadres in Pakistan being coerced to join the ranks of HM. Fuelled by resources from Pakistan State actors and Pakistan Jamaat; Hizbul also targeted other militant groups, killing hundreds while neutralising and disarming more than 7,000. Hizbul also murdered several of the pro- independence intelligentsia with JKLF leanings. Some of these killings included Hriday Nath Wanchoo, a Kashmiri Pandit human rights advocate. Hizbul militant Ashiq Hussain Faktoo was convicted for his killing. Other prominent killings included Dr. Abdul Ahad Guru who was a cardiologist and JKLF ideologue, Mirwaiz Qazi Nisar and Mirwaiz Maulvi Farooq, Mohammed Maqbool Malik, Prof. Abdul Ahad Wani, Muhammad Sultan Bhat, Abdul Ghani Lone, and Abdul Majeed Dar. Hizbul was instrumental in preventing the return of Kashmiri Pandits after their ethnic cleansing from the valley, Salahudeen spoke of them being Hindu agents whilst threatening to auction their properties. Many of operations of the outfit during 1994-95 were designed to polarise the masses along religious lines.  Zenith  By 1994, many JKLF members had denounced militancy and some even joined state politics, which led to further splintering amongst JKLF and a complete yield of its military dominance to Hizbul which grew up to be the major force in Kashmir despite facing a much widespread and effective counter insurgency response from the Indian forces. This survival has been attributed to its widespread penetration across rural networks. By 1996, the arm-bearing factions of JKLF were entirely crushed and with other local insurgent factions having either disbanded or becoming defunct or having switched loyalties to the Indian cause; Hizbul was the sole militant group operating in the valley. Analysts and academics though believe that Hizbul lacked popular support in the valley and that their aversion to pro-independence ideas and Sufi practices alienated many Kashmiris.  Retreat  But roughly beginning the same time, Hizbul actually started to lose their popular influence in the valley. People from the fellow militant groups often aligned with the counter insurgency operations to avenge the Hizbul or protect themselves from the Hizbul, killing many Hizbul commanders in the process. They also imparted ground intelligence to the Indian forces; thus systematically degrading Hizbul's own networks. A simultaneous targeting of Jaamat's militants led to their revoking theirs open support for Hizbul, which destroyed the social fabric of Hizbul to a large extent. By the end of the 1990s; Hizbul was forced to go for a retreat. The Al-Badr faction split in 1998 due to a dislike of excessive interference by Jaamat.  Ceasefire of 2000 and withdrawal  In the following years, the group started to fragment as ISI pushed foreign extremists into Hizbul. Rivalries developed often leading to violence, and one such incident culminated in the killing of 21 people in a Pakistan administered Kashmir village in 1998. Several Hizbul members were increasingly displeased with ISI's manners of treating the Kashmiris and with more militants joining mainstream politics, they were pushed to the sidelines. Starting April 2000, there were alleged parleys between Abdul Majid Dar, the Kashmir commander and other top leaders of Hizbul with Research and Analysis Wing (RAW) and Intelligence Bureau (IB) officials in Delhi and other venues; that led to the build-up of a ceasefire offer. Offensive counter-insurgency operations against the group were also reduced. On 24 July 2000, Dar, along with four other Hizb commander (some Hizb commanders didn't agree with Dar) made an unconditional ceasefire declaration for a span of 3 months, from the outskirts of Srinagar and asserted it to be backed by the consent of the local populace, who were surveyed. Majeed Dar had also apparently visited Pakistan before the announcement for consultations with the HM Central Command. The ceasefire was welcomed and approved in India, near unanimously and was immediately ratified by the Pakistan-based commander Sayeed Salahudeen who until then was against any diplomatic resolution. The Pakistani government soon enough ordered its forward posts on the LOC, to abide by a no-shoot first policy. A unit-commander from Pakistan-administered Kashmir in the Pir-Panjal area disagreed with the ceasefire and was expelled along with his faction; leading to a violent clash with the Pakistan Jaamat. On the next day, Muttahida Jihad Council (MJC), a coalition of 16 radical Islamist organisations (that comprised Hizbul and was incidentally chaired by Salahudeen himself), severely criticised the ceasefire declaration. Hizbul was soon revoked of its council membership and Salahudeen lost his chair. Jamaat leaders too vociferously criticised the ceasefire declaration and alleged it to be an act of sabotage. LeT launched multiple attacks killing and injuring numerous civilians as a form of protest against the ceasefire declaration with an aim to derail it. Two rounds of talks were smoothly held and a cricket match was played out between Indian armed forces and Hizbul. The Indian government did not agree to indulge with Pakistan and whilst Pakistani government initially maintained a neutral posture of abiding by the wishes of the Kashmiri populace, it later changed its stance and demanded a representation. Salahuddin then called off the talks on August 8 under flimsy pretexts; interpreting an address of Vajpayee to the Parliament as calling for a strict abidance of the Indian delegation to the Indian constitution. He also re-warned of more escalation and threatened to spill their activities over the rest of India; incidentally Hizbul's earlier stance was to wage war against the Indian occupation but not against India. The US State Department as well as the British Foreign Office blamed Hizbul for the failure of the process. The ceasefire move, its immediate endorsement and subsequent withdrawal highlighted deep divisions between the more hawkish operatives in Pakistan administered Kashmir and those based in India. Dar was soon removed from his role of military commander and in May 2002, he was formally expelled from the Hizb along with a number of supporters and commanders whilst being.denounced as an agent of Research and Analysis Wing (RAW). Dar and several other ex- leaders were assassinated by Hizbul between 2001 and 2003. By 2003, most key leaders of Hizbul were in Azad Kashmir and they were quite inactive in Kashmir; a fragmented Hizbul survived a total collapse but had metamorphosed into a vanguard group. Yet, in 2004 it was still “regarded as one of the most influential groups involved in the conflict over Kashmir.” As of 2009, it was supposedly “the brand name of the Kashmir militancy because of being the largest and the most important in terms of its effectiveness in perpetrating violence across Kashmir.”  2010s  On 8 July 2016, Hizbul Mujahideen commander, Burhan Muzaffar Wani, along with 2 other insurgents were shot dead by Indian security forces. Widespread protests erupted in the Kashmir valley after Wani's death, causing unrest in the valley for nearly half a year. More than 96 people died while over 15,000 civilians and more than 4,000 security personnel were injured. The violence which erupted after his death was described as the worst unrest in the region since the 2010 Kashmir unrest, with Kashmir being placed under 53 consecutive days of curfews imposed by authorities. Wani was succeeded by Sabzar Bhat, who had previously been a close aide of his. Indian security forces considered Bhat effective at using social media to recruit youth towards militancy. Indian security forces previously located him in Rathsuna, in March 2017, but he was able to evade them after a 15-hour gunfight that left one policeman dead. Bhat was killed in May 2017 and subsequently buried in Pulwama. His death sparked clashes and a police-imposed curfew, during which a youth was killed in clashes with the Central Reserve Police Force. Internet and phone service across Kashmir was suspended in an attempt to calm the region. A previously-unknown militant group, Mujahideen Taliban-e-Kashmir, claimed it had provided information on Bhat to security forces. The claim remains unverified, though some analysts suggested it reflected a growing schism between various militant groups in Kashmir, with members of Hizbul Mujahideen concerned that Zakir Musa may have betrayed Bhat.

Forms of subsidies include direct housing subsidies, non- profit housing, public housing, rent supplements, and some forms of co- operative and private sector housing. In the United States, subsidized housing is often called \\"affordable housing.\\" Increasing access to housing may contribute to lower poverty.  Types = Co-operative housing  Some co- operative housing may offer subsidized units, but its main mandate is not subsidization. Its operating mandate is to offer non profit housing, where the rents or housing charges as they are called, goes back into the maintenance of the building instead of the profit of a landlord. Co-operative housing is controlled by the members of the co-op, which is run by a board of directors. There is no outside landlord. In most cases, all residents of the co-op become members and are owners, and agree to follow certain by-laws. Some co-ops are subsidized housing because they receive government funding to support a rent- geared-to-income program for low-income residents. There are other co-ops that are market-rate and limited equity, these types of cooperatives do not receive government funding and are not subsidized housing. In addition to providing affordable housing, some co-ops serve the needs of specific communities, including seniors, artists, and persons with disabilities. Examples of co- operative housing include: College Houses, Urban Homesteading Assistance Board (UHAB), and Habitat '67, and regular rental housing be they regular looking apartments, townhouses or high end buildings such as those overlooking Central Park in New York City.  Housing subsidies  Housing subsidies are a government's financial assistance to help provide housing. =Home mortgage interest deduction= The largest housing subsidy in the US is the home mortgage interest deduction, which allows homeowners with mortgages on first homes, second homes, and even boats with bathrooms to lower their taxes owed. The cost to the federal government of the mortgage interest deductions in 2018 was approximately $25 billion, down from $60 billion for 2017 as a result of the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act of 2017. Some states also have the mortgage interest deduction provision. The majority of the home mortgage interest deduction goes to the top 5% income earners in the United States. =Rental subsidies= Some housing subsidies are also provided to low income tenants in renting housing. These include shelter allowances, housing supplements, and shelter supplements from regional and local governments designed to help low-income households that spend a large proportion of their income on rent, such as New York City's Family Eviction Prevention Supplement program. The subsidies are often defined by whether the subsidy is given to the landlord and then criteria are set for the tenants they can lease to or whether the subsidy is given to the tenant, typically as a voucher, and they are allowed to find suitable private housing. The subsidy amount is typically based on the tenant's income, usually the difference between the rent and 30% of the tenant's gross income, but other formulas have been used.Haffner, M and Oxley, M, \\"Housing Subsidies: Definitions and Comparisons\\", Housing Studies, Volume 14, Number 2, 1 March 1999 , pp. 145-162(18) In rare cases a financial institution or non-profit organization will provide mortgage loans at rates that are not profitable for the sake of a specific group. In Canada one such organization is Non-Profit Housing Subsidies Canada which provides subsidized mortgage loans to employees and volunteers of other non-profit organizations.http://www.nphsc.org = Non-profit housing = Non-profit housing is owned and managed by private non-profit groups such as churches, ethnocultural communities or by governments. Many units are provided by community development corporations (CDCs). They use private funding and government subsidies to support a rent-geared-towards-income program for low- income tenants.HUD, \\"Status and Prospects of the Nonprofit Housing Sector\\" , June 1995Cf. Koebel (1998), chapters on Non-Profit Housing  Public housing  Public housing is real property owned and managed by the government. Tenants must meet specific eligibility requirements.  Rent supplements  Rent supplements are subsidies paid by the government to private landlords who accept low-income tenants. The supplements make up the difference between rental \\"market price\\" and the amount of rent paid by tenants, for example 30% of the tenants income. A notable example of a rent supplement in the United States is Section 8 of the Housing Act of 1937 (). According to a 2018 study, major cuts in rental subsidies for poor households in the United Kingdom led to lowered house prices.

Hasland is located South of Spital, East of Birdholme and North of Grassmoor. Hasland is a ward of the Borough of Chesterfield. The ward population at the 2011 Census was 6,615. The A617 (Hasland By-Pass) links Hasland, along with Chesterfield, to the M1. Historically a village, with many local residents continuing to refer to it as a village, it expanded greatly during the 20th century and now merges with Chesterfield itself. The expansion of Hasland has created a dense array of shops and services, including: a theatre, three schools, two churches, two medical centres and a couple of industrial estates. Eastwood Park In 1913, Alderman Eastwood (Mayor of Chesterfield, 1905–1908) donated the park to the public in memory of his late father. The Deputy Mayor, Ald. C.P. Markham, showed enormous gratitude in accepting the gift: \\"Hasland is now set up for all time. It has got a very wide street and Ald. Eastwood has finished it off by giving one of the most handsome parks there will be in this part of the world\\". The first condition on donating the park was that it should be called \\"Hasland Park\\", however Eastwood later accepted the council's decision to name the park \\"Eastwood Park\\". Eastwood Park was closed for over 6 months in September 2012, as part of a major restoration project. Chesterfield Borough Council received £1.07m from the Heritage Lottery Fund and contributed a further £201,000. The original four- week closure was extended following complications in planning and construction work, partially due to flooding during early 2013. The restoration project includes improvements to the Hasland Village Hall and fountain, modernisation of play areas, a new sports pavilion and a new multi-use games area. The council also announced plans to rename the park to Eastwood Park, a Queen Elizabeth II Field, as part of the legacy of the Queen's Diamond Jubilee. Eastwood Park Reopening Stone, 2013 Shopping Mansfield Road, towards the South-East of Hasland, is home to a row of convenience and specialist shops. These include: a post office, petrol station, sweet shop, fish bar, Co-op, greengrocer, florist, bookmakers, and a computer repair shop. Because of the diversity of shops on Mansfield Road, there is little demand for shops elsewhere in Hasland and you can walk to Chesterfield town centre in no time at all. Churches The Methodist Church was founded in a cottage on Chapel Lane East in 1831 and moved to its present site (on Hampton Street) in 1901. St Paul's Church, Hasland is an Anglican church, the parish church of Hasland, and was built in 1850 in the south of Hasland. Before this church was built, most people were baptised, married and buried at Church of St. Mary and All Saints (also an Anglican church) in Chesterfield town centre. Schools There are three schools in Hasland, providing education for pupils aged 4–16. There is no sixth form in Hasland, however students normally continue their education at the nearby Chesterfield College or a local sixth form. Hasland Infant School is situated on Eyre Street East and opened in 1904. The Infant School has recently added an extra block of buildings, and is now bigger, with a newer nursery part of the school. Hasland Junior School is situated on The Green, and Hasland Hall Community School (the secondary school) is on Broomfield Avenue. right Hasland Junior School is a medium-sized school, catering for about 400 pupils. Before the opening of the new building in September 2007, the school occupied a large split site separated by a busy road, and there was a great deal of movement between the two sites. The new site is now located on the same side of the road as Hasland Hall Community School. The foundation stone of the original school was laid in 1864. Hasland Hall Community School is situated on Broomfield Avenue. It currently caters for around 880 students. The building of 5 new classrooms has recently been completed. These opened in September 2006, and are currently the languages block for the school. Scouts and Guides Hasland has a thriving Scout group consisting of a Beaver Colony, a Cub Pack, a Scout Troop, two Rainbow Units, three Brownie Packs and two Guide Groups. 1st Hasland meet weekly at the Youth Centre (near Hasland Hall). The Scouts, Cubs and Guides participate in the Annual Remembrance Service, held in Eastwood Park and the St. Georges Day parade in the town centre. In addition to the popular annual Christmas Fayre in Eastwood Park, the Scout Group has also hosted a Summer Fayre in 2010, raising around £1,000 for the group.

It improves on the Hartree–Fock method by adding electron correlation effects by means of Rayleigh–Schrödinger perturbation theory (RS-PT), usually to second (MP2), third (MP3) or fourth (MP4) order. Its main idea was published as early as 1934 by Christian Møller and Milton S. Plesset.  Rayleigh–Schrödinger perturbation theory  The MP perturbation theory is a special case of RS perturbation theory. In RS theory one considers an unperturbed Hamiltonian operator \\\\hat{H}_{0}, to which a small (often external) perturbation \\\\hat{V} is added: :\\\\hat{H} = \\\\hat{H}_{0} + \\\\lambda \\\\hat{V}. Here, λ is an arbitrary real parameter that controls the size of the perturbation. In MP theory the zeroth-order wave function is an exact eigenfunction of the Fock operator, which thus serves as the unperturbed operator. The perturbation is the correlation potential. In RS-PT the perturbed wave function and perturbed energy are expressed as a power series in λ: : \\\\Psi = \\\\lim_{m \\\\to \\\\infty} \\\\sum_{i=0}^{m} \\\\lambda^{i} \\\\Psi^{(i)}, : E = \\\\lim_{m \\\\to \\\\infty} \\\\sum_{i=0}^{m} \\\\lambda^{i} E^{(i)}.

Møller–Plesset perturbation = Original formulation  The MP-energy corrections are obtained from Rayleigh–Schrödinger (RS) perturbation theory with the unperturbed Hamiltonian defined as the shifted Fock operator, :\\\\hat{H}_{0} \\\\equiv \\\\hat{F} + \\\\langle\\\\Phi_0  (\\\\hat{H} - \\\\hat{F})  \\\\Phi_0\\\\rangle and the perturbation defined as the correlation potential, :\\\\hat{V} \\\\equiv \\\\hat{H} - \\\\hat{H}_{0} = \\\\hat{H} - \\\\left(\\\\hat{F} + \\\\langle\\\\Phi_0  (\\\\hat{H} - \\\\hat{F})  \\\\Phi_0\\\\rangle\\\\right), where the normalized Slater determinant Φ0 is the lowest eigenstate of the Fock operator: :\\\\hat{F} \\\\Phi_0 \\\\equiv \\\\sum_{k = 1}^{N} \\\\hat{f}(k) \\\\Phi_0 = 2 \\\\sum_{i = 1}^{N / 2} \\\\varepsilon_i \\\\Phi_0. Here N is the number of electrons in the molecule under consideration (a factor of 2 in the energy arises from the fact that each orbital is occupied by a pair of electrons with opposite spin), \\\\hat{H} is the usual electronic Hamiltonian, \\\\hat{f}(k) is the one- electron Fock operator, and εi is the orbital energy belonging to the doubly occupied spatial orbital φi. Since the Slater determinant Φ0 is an eigenstate of \\\\hat{F}, it follows readily that :\\\\hat{F} \\\\Phi_0 - \\\\langle\\\\Phi_0  \\\\hat{F}  \\\\Phi_0\\\\rangle \\\\Phi_0 = 0 \\\\implies \\\\hat{H}_{0} \\\\Phi_0 = \\\\langle\\\\Phi_0  \\\\hat{H}  \\\\Phi_0\\\\rangle \\\\Phi_0, i.e. the zeroth-order energy is the expectation value of \\\\hat{H} with respect to Φ0, the Hartree-Fock energy. Similarly, it can be seen that in this formulation the MP1 energy : E_{\\\\text{MP1}} \\\\equiv \\\\langle\\\\Phi_0  \\\\hat{V}  \\\\Phi_0\\\\rangle = 0. Hence, the first meaningful correction appears at MP2 energy. In order to obtain the MP2 formula for a closed-shell molecule, the second order RS-PT formula is written in a basis of doubly excited Slater determinants. (Singly excited Slater determinants do not contribute because of the Brillouin theorem). After application of the Slater–Condon rules for the simplification of N-electron matrix elements with Slater determinants in bra and ket and integrating out spin, it becomes : \\\\begin{align} E_{\\\\text{MP2}} &= 2 \\\\sum_{i, j, a, b} \\\\frac{\\\\langle\\\\varphi_i \\\\varphi_j  \\\\hat{\\\\tilde{v}}  \\\\varphi_a \\\\varphi_b\\\\rangle \\\\langle\\\\varphi_a \\\\varphi_b  \\\\hat{\\\\tilde{v}}  \\\\varphi_i \\\\varphi_j\\\\rangle} {\\\\varepsilon_i + \\\\varepsilon_j - \\\\varepsilon_a - \\\\varepsilon_b} \\\\- \\\\sum_{i, j, a, b} \\\\frac{\\\\langle\\\\varphi_i \\\\varphi_j  \\\\hat{\\\\tilde{v}}  \\\\varphi_a \\\\varphi_b\\\\rangle \\\\langle\\\\varphi_a \\\\varphi_b  \\\\hat{\\\\tilde{v}}  \\\\varphi_j \\\\varphi_i\\\\rangle} {\\\\varepsilon_i + \\\\varepsilon_j - \\\\varepsilon_a - \\\\varepsilon_b} \\\\ \\\\end{align} where 𝜑i and 𝜑j are canonical occupied orbitals and 𝜑a and 𝜑b are virtual (or unoccupied) orbitals. The quantities εi, εj, εa, and εb are the corresponding orbital energies. Clearly, through second-order in the correlation potential, the total electronic energy is given by the Hartree–Fock energy plus second-order MP correction: . The solution of the zeroth-order MP equation (which by definition is the Hartree–Fock equation) gives the Hartree–Fock energy. The first non-vanishing perturbation correction beyond the Hartree–Fock treatment is the second-order energy.  Alternative formulation  Equivalent expressions are obtained by a slightly different partitioning of the Hamiltonian, which results in a different division of energy terms over zeroth- and first-order contributions, while for second- and higher-order energy corrections the two partitionings give identical results. The formulation is commonly used by chemists, who are now large users of these methods.See all volumes under #Further reading. This difference is due to the fact, well known in Hartree–Fock theory, that : \\\\langle\\\\Phi_0  (\\\\hat{H} - \\\\hat{F})  \\\\Phi_0\\\\rangle e 0 \\\\qquad \\\\Longleftrightarrow \\\\qquad E_{\\\\text{HF}} e 2 \\\\sum_{i=1}^{N/2} \\\\varepsilon_i. (The Hartree–Fock energy is not equal to the sum of occupied-orbital energies). In the alternative partitioning, one defines : \\\\hat{H}_0 \\\\equiv \\\\hat{F}, \\\\qquad \\\\hat{V} \\\\equiv \\\\hat{H} - \\\\hat{F}. Clearly, in this partitioning, : E_{\\\\text{MP0}} = 2 \\\\sum_{i = 1}^{N/2} \\\\varepsilon_i, \\\\qquad E_{\\\\text{MP1}} = E_{\\\\text{HF}} - 2 \\\\sum_{i = 1}^{N/2} \\\\varepsilon_i. Obviously, with this alternative formulation, the Møller–Plesset theorem does not hold in the literal sense that EMP1 ≠ 0. The solution of the zeroth-order MP equation is the sum of orbital energies. The zeroth plus first-order correction yields the Hartree–Fock energy. As with the original formulation, the first non-vanishing perturbation correction beyond the Hartree–Fock treatment is the second-order energy. To reiterate, the second- and higher- order corrections are the same in both formulations.  Use of Møller–Plesset perturbation methods  Second (MP2), third (MP3), and fourth (MP4) order Møller–Plesset calculations are standard levels used in calculating small systems and are implemented in many computational chemistry codes. Higher level MP calculations, generally only MP5, are possible in some codes. However, they are rarely used because of their cost. Systematic studies of MP perturbation theory have shown that it is not necessarily a convergent theory at high orders. Convergence can be slow, rapid, oscillatory, regular, highly erratic or simply non-existent, depending on the precise chemical system or basis set. The density matrix for the first-order and higher MP2 wavefunction is of the type known as response density, which differs from the more usual expectation value density. The eigenvalues of the response density matrix (which are the occupation numbers of the MP2 natural orbitals) can therefore be greater than 2 or negative. Unphysical numbers are a sign of a divergent perturbation expansion. Additionally, various important molecular properties calculated at MP3 and MP4 level are no better than their MP2 counterparts, even for small molecules. For open shell molecules, MPn-theory can directly be applied only to unrestricted Hartree–Fock reference functions (since UHF states are not in general eigenvectors of the Fock operator). However, the resulting energies often suffer from severe spin contamination, leading to large errors. A possible better alternative is to use one of the MP2-like methods based on restricted open-shell Hartree–Fock (ROHF). Unfortunately, there are many ROHF based MP2-like methods because of arbitrariness in the ROHF wavefunction(for example HCPT, ROMP, RMP (also called ROHF-MBPT2), OPT1 and OPT2, ZAPT, IOPT, etc.). Some of the ROHF based MP2-like theories suffer from spin-contamination in their perturbed density and energies beyond second- order. These methods, Hartree–Fock, unrestricted Hartree–Fock and restricted Hartree–Fock use a single determinant wave function. Multi-configurational self-consistent field (MCSCF) methods use several determinants and can be used for the unperturbed operator, although not uniquely, so many methods, such as complete active space perturbation theory (CASPT2), and Multi-Configuration Quasi-Degenerate Perturbation Theory (MCQDPT), have been developed. Unfortunately, MCSCF based methods are not without perturbation series divergences.

By the time the violence had been quelled, one Australian soldier was dead and hundreds of Australians and U.S. servicemen had been injured.Peter Dunn, 2005, \\"The Battle Of Brisbane – 26 & 27 November 1942\\" (Australia @ War) Accessed 15 December 2006 News reports of these incidents were suppressed overseas, with the causes of the riot not made evident in the few newspaper reports of the event that were published within Australia. Background Early 1942; U.S. military police outside the Central Hotel, Brisbane. (Source: Sunday Truth, Brisbane/State Library of Queensland.) U.S. servicemen march through King George Square, Brisbane, circa 1943. From 1942 until 1945 during the Pacific War, up to one million U.S. military personnel, which included around 100,000 African-Americans, were stationed at various locations throughout eastern Australia. These forces included personnel awaiting deployment to combat operations elsewhere in the Pacific, troops resting, convalescing, and/or refitting from previous combat operations, or military personnel manning Allied military bases and installations in Australia. Many U.S. personnel were stationed in and around Brisbane, which was the headquarters for General Douglas MacArthur, Supreme Allied Commander, South West Pacific Area. Many buildings and facilities around Brisbane were given over to the U.S. military's use. Brisbane found it difficult to cope, starting in December 1941, as their population of roughly 330,000 increased by 80,000 during the peak period.United States forces in Queensland, 1941–45 – Fact sheet 234, National Archives of Australia. Archived from the original on 30 March 2019. The city was fortified, schools were closed, brownouts enforced, crime increased, and many families sold up and moved inland. At the height of the Pacific war, Australian Prime Minister John Curtin raised the roles of American journalists to spread enthusiasm from the U.S. for his country's defence. This showed a new side to how leaders of allied nations could expand American press interaction and influence the White House during the war. \\"As a former journalist, Curtin extended his candid press talks and the fledgling Australian radio and newsreel media to involve U.S. reporters in his campaign for an escalated offensive from America’s Southwest Pacific headquarters in Brisbane, Australia,\\" says Coatney, who wrote about the subject in his journal. Curtin still lost American press support he needed in order to prevent some of Australia's troops from fighting in the Battle of Burma.COATNEY, C. From Burma Battles to \\"the Bright Lights of Brisbane\\". Journalism History. 40, 4, 229–239, 2015. . Access to goods and services Although the military personnel from Australia and the United States usually enjoyed a cooperative and convivial relationship, there were tensions between the two forces that sometimes resulted in violence. Many factors reportedly contributed to these tensions, including the fact that U.S. forces received better rations than Australian soldiers, shops and hotels regularly gave preferential treatment to Americans, and the American custom of \\"caressing girls in public\\" was seen as offensive to the Australian morals of the day. Lack of amenities for the Australians in the city also played a part. The Americans had PXs offering merchandise, food, alcohol, cigarettes, hams, turkeys, ice cream, chocolates, and nylon stockings at low prices, all items that were either forbidden, heavily rationed, or highly priced to Australians. Australian servicemen were not allowed into these establishments, while Australian canteens on the other hand provided meals, soft drinks, tea, and sandwiches but not alcohol, cigarettes, and other luxuries.Raymond Evans and Jacqui Donegan The Battle of Brisbane Politics and Culture 10 August 2010 Hotels were only allowed to serve alcohol twice a day for one hour at a time of their choosing, leading to large numbers of Australian servicemen on the streets rushing from one hotel to the next and then drinking as quickly as possible before it closed. Differences in pay U.S. military pay was considerably higher than that of the Australian militaryThe U.S. pay rate was $11.40/week (including allowances, cost of living and lower taxes, this is the equivalent to a civilian income of $69.23/week) for an unmarried American private compared to $3.50/week for an unmarried Australian private, which was equivalent to a civilian income of $18.70/week. Source: Barron's National Business and Financial Weekly, 24 April 1944 and Government of Australia legislation \\"Pay rates for the 2nd AIF 1939–1945\\" and U.S. military uniforms were seen as more appealing than those of the Australians.. The U.S. Army provided silk stockings and candy to American troops which they handed out to Australian women, as well as U.S. Army rations, in a time where Australians were on a poor diet due to rationing of food to civilians. This resulted in U.S. servicemen not only enjoying success in their pursuit of the few available women but also led to many Americans marrying Australian women, facts greatly resented by the Australians. In mid-1942, a reporter walking along Queen Street counted 152 local women in company with 112 uniformed Americans, while only 31 women accompanied 60 Australian soldiers. That it was thought necessary for the media to report this situation indicates the effect of the American presence. (About 12,000 Australian women married American soldiers by the end of the war.) \\"They're overpaid, oversexed, and over here\\" was a common phrase used by Australians around this time and is still an anecdote recognised by some in modern generations. Opinions of each other's soldiers Another concern was the way the Australian military was viewed by America's high command. Douglas MacArthur had already expressed a low opinion of Australian troops, who were then fighting along the Kokoda Track. Though Australia was bearing the brunt of the land war in New Guinea by itself, MacArthur would report back to the United States on \\"American victories\\", while Australian victories were communicated to the United States as \\"American and Allied victories\\". Americans' general ignorance of Australia, and American perceptions that Australians lacked a certain \\"get-up-and-go\\", also soured relations. Likewise Australians also looked down upon the fighting qualities of Americans; most considered the Americans an inferior fighting force who seemed all glitz and brashness. Even MacArthur was upset and humiliated by reports that during an earlier attack against the perimeter's eastern flank at Buna, American soldiers had dropped their weapons and run from the Japanese. This feeling towards the Americans would be furthered during the Battle of Buna, where Australian troops bore the brunt of the fighting due to American \\"inactivity\\", and Sanananda, the final victory. Buna, the fourth major Allied victory in New Guinea, was presented not only as the first major victory but an American one. Sanananda, an Australian victory, was presented as merely a mopping-up operation. The Americans would not acknowledge that Australians won the critical battles of Milne Bay, Kokoda and Gona, were largely responsible for the victory at Buna, and were \\"overwhelmingly\\" responsible for victory at Sanananda.Brune, Peter A Bastard of a Place Allen & Unwin Pg 601–622 Australians often regarded the U.S. soldiers as boasting how they, and they alone, saved Australia. Australia did not have a draft during World War II; the militia was made up of volunteers and enlistees. The militia could not be sent overseas, but they could be used for Australia's defence. The defence included New Guinea and Papua. The militia was ridiculed by the AIF as being \\"chocolate soldiers\\" or chocos. Another factor in 'the war' was the difference between the troops and the provost corps or military police. The military police were forced to do the duty no one else wanted because they were seen as misfits. This caused the Aussie Digger to have little to no respect for them. A rule was stated that the military police had to be unarmed. In Brisbane, the military police were Americans, had the right to be armed, and were seen as arrogant.UNSINGER, PC. THE BATTLE OF BRISBANE: Australians and Yanks at War (Book). Military Review. 82, 2, 111, Mar. 2002. . Views on race While race was not a direct causative factor in this instance, it has been cited as a cause of tension between Australians and Americans and as a contributing factor. This tension arose from the treatment and segregation of the African- American soldiers by the U.S. military. Racial issues and segregation also played a substantial role in conflict between locals and Americans in both New Zealand and Britain. While Baker reports that in civilian life white Australians treated Aborigines in largely the same way as white Americans treated blacks, Hall reports that institutional discrimination was \\"paternalistic\\", varying significantly from state-to-state. Despite official policy ostensibly barring the enlistment of indigenous Australians, in practice, a more flexible approach was adopted that saw many indigenous Australians enlist. Segregation was not practised in the main and Indigenous Australians received equal pay, were promoted on merit and were generally accepted and treated as equals.Hall 1995, pp. 28–29. Troops of the U.S. 208th Coast Artillery rioted for 10 nights in March 1942, fighting against African- Americans from the 394th Quartermaster Battalion. This was attributed to white American resentment towards African-American access to dance halls and for associating with \\"white girls on the streets of Brisbane\\". As a result, U.S. military authorities segregated African-Americans, restricting them to the south side of the Brisbane River. However, trouble continued with a major race riot at Wacol, knife fights in South Brisbane and American military police assaulting or killing black troops simply for crossing the Brisbane River. This further incited the Australians, whose culture towards military police was notably different. Events immediately prior According to authorities, up to 20 brawls a night were occurring between Australian and American servicemen. In the weeks leading up to the Battle of Brisbane there were several major incidents, including a gun battle between an American soldier and Australian troops near Inkerman which left one Australian and the American dead, an Australian soldier was shot by an American MP in Townsville, an American serviceman and three Australian soldiers in Brisbane's Centenary Place were involved in a confrontation which left one Australian dead, an American soldier was arrested for stabbing three servicemen and a Brisbane woman near the Central railway station, and twenty Australians fought American submariners and members of the USN Shore Patrol, mauling them badly. On the morning of the battle, an Australian soldier was batoned by an American MP in Albert Street. Battle=First Night - 26 November 1942 Adelaide Street and Creek Street, along with the nearby U.S. military Post Exchange (PX), was attacked by Australian servicemen and civilians, on 26–27 November 1942. According to Australian historian Barry Ralph,Cited by Dunn, 2005, op cit. on 26 November an intoxicated Private James R. Stein of the U.S. 404th Signal Company left the hotel where he had been drinking when it closed at 6:50 p.m. and began walking to the Post Exchange (PX) on the corner of Creek and Adelaide Street some 50 metres (55 yards) further down the road. He had stopped to talk with three Australians when Private Anthony E. O'Sullivan of the U.S. 814th Military Police Company (MP) approached and asked Stein for his leave pass. While Stein was looking for it, the MP became impatient and asked him to hurry up before grabbing his pass and arresting him. At this the Australians began swearing at the MP and telling him to leave Stein alone. American MPs were not well regarded by Australians because the Australians thought they were arrogant and used batons at the least provocation. When O'Sullivan raised his baton as if to strike one of the Australians, they attacked him. More MPs arrived, blowing whistles, while nearby Australian servicemen and several civilians rushed to help their countrymen. Outnumbered, the MPs retreated to the PX, carrying the injured O'Sullivan. Stein went with them. In the meantime, a crowd of up to 100 Australian servicemen and civilians had gathered and began to besiege the PX, throwing bottles and rocks and breaking windows. Police Inspector Charles Price arrived but could do nothing as the crowd continued to grow, with the American Red Cross Club diagonally opposite the PX also coming under siege. Sporadic fights broke out throughout the city. The Tivoli Theatre was closed, with servicemen ordered back to their barracks and ships, while soldiers with fixed bayonets escorted women in the city from the area. By 8 p.m. up to 5,000 people were involved in the disturbance. Several Australian MPs removed their armbands and joined in. Corporal Duncan Caporn commandeered a small truck driven by an Australian officer and three soldiers. The truck contained four Owen sub-machine guns, several boxes of ammunition and some hand grenades. The local Brisbane Fire Brigade arrived but simply looked on and did not use their hoses. The American authorities were later to criticise them for not doing so. Death of Gunner Webster The 738th MP Battalion in the PX started to arm the MPs with shotguns to protect the building and they moved to the front. People in the crowd took umbrage at this demonstration of force and attempted to relieve Private Norbert Grant of C Company of his weapon. He jabbed one Australian with his gun before Gunner Edward S. Webster, a driver with the 2/2nd Australian Anti-Tank Regiment grabbed the barrel, while another soldier grabbed him around the neck. During the scuffle, the gun was discharged three times. The first shot hit Webster in the chest, killing him instantly. The following two shots hit Private Kenneth Henkel in the cheek and forearm, Private Ian Tieman in the chest, Private Frank Corrie in the thigh, Sapper De Vosso in the thigh and Lance Corporal Richard Ledson was wounded in the left thigh and left hand and also received a compound fracture of the left ankle. Ledson was later discharged due to his injuries. Two civilians were also hit, Joseph Hanlon was wounded in the leg and 18-year-old Walter Maidment was also wounded. In the confusion, Grant managed to run back towards the PX, hitting an Australian over the head with his shotgun, breaking the butt of his weapon while doing so. An American soldier, Private Joseph Hoffman, received a fractured skull in the scuffle. By 10 p.m. the crowd had dispersed, leaving the ground floor of the American PX destroyed. A war correspondent, John Hinde, was on a hotel balcony overlooking the scene and later stated \\"The most furious battle I ever saw during the war was that night in Brisbane. It was like a civil war.\\" Second Night - 27 November 1942 On the following night, a crowd of 500 to 600 Australian servicemen gathered outside the Red Cross building. The PX building was under heavy security and heavily armed American MPs were located on the first floor of the Red Cross. NCOs went through the crowd and confiscated several hand grenades. In Queen Street, a group of soldiers armed with MP batons ran into 20 U.S. MPs who formed a line and drew their handguns. An Australian officer intervened and persuaded the American commander to take his men away from the area. The crowd then moved to the corner of Queen and Edward Streets outside MacArthur's headquarters in the AMP Building and began shouting abuse towards the building. The intersection was filled with rings of Australians beating up GIs and more than 20 were injured. U.S. Army Sergeant Bill Bentson, who was present on both nights, recalled how he was amazed to see \\"Americans flying up in the air.\\" Australian writer Margaret Scott who, along with her American husband, had been assaulted in Edward Street during the riot, has stated that several U.S. servicemen were beaten to death and one shot in the fighting but there are no official records supporting this claim. Aftermath Workers repairing broken windows at the American canteen in Brisbane on 28 November 1942 On the first night one Australian serviceman was killed, eight people suffered gunshot wounds and several hundred people were injured. The second night, eight U.S. MPs, one serviceman and four American officers were hospitalised with countless others injured. The units involved in the riots were relocated out of Brisbane, the MPs' strength was increased, the Australian canteen was closed and the American PX was relocated. Court Martial Pvt. Grant was later court- martialled by the U.S. military authorities for manslaughter in relation to the death of Webster, but was acquitted on the grounds of self- defence.Australian Broadcasting Corporation, 7.30 Report, 27 December 2000, \\"Book reveals allied soldiers brawling on Brisbane streets\\" Downloaded 15 December 2006 Five Australians were convicted of assault as a result of the events described above, and one was jailed for six months.Dunn, 2005, op cit. The Chief Censor's Office in Brisbane ordered that \\"No cabling or broadcasting of details of tonight's Brisbane servicemen's riot. Background for censors only: one Australian killed, six wounded.\\" The Brisbane Courier Mail did publish a heavily censored article the next day about the incident. Although the article mentioned the death and injuries it did not give any idea of nationalities involved or any specific details. It is believed that the incident was never reported by U.S. media and American servicemen in Brisbane had their mail censored to remove any mention. As a result of the secrecy many rumours and exaggerated stories circulated in Brisbane over the following weeks including one saying that 15 Australian servicemen had been shot by Americans with machine guns with the bodies being piled on the Post Office steps. Following the Battle of Brisbane, resentment towards American troops led to several smaller riots in Townsville, Rockhampton and Mount Isa. Similar riots in other states also followed: Melbourne on 1 December 1942, Bondi on 6 February 1943, Perth in January 1944 and Fremantle in April 1944.Evans and Donegan See also *Battle of Manners Street, a similar riot in New Zealand *Townsville Mutiny *Zoot Suit Riots  Notes  References = Citations  Sources   * Carey, Peter.

Here She Comes Now \\"Here She Comes Now\\" was recorded in April 1990 by Butch Vig at Smart Studios in Madison, Wisconsin. These sessions represented the band's initial attempts at recording a second album for their original label, Sub Pop, but this was abandoned after the band signed with DGC Records in late 1990, and instead recorded their breakthrough album, Nevermind, with Vig in May 1991. \\"Here She Comes Now\\" was one of several songs recorded during the Smart sessions which still saw official release in 1990 or 1991, along with \\"Dive\\" (on the 1990 \\"Sliver\\" single), \\"In Bloom\\" (as a music video, on the 1991 home video Sub Pop Video Network Program) and \\"Polly\\" (on Nevermind). \\"Here She Comes Now\\" had already been officially-released by the time the single was released, first appearing on the Communion compilation Heaven & Hell – A Tribute to The Velvet Underground earlier in 1991. It was re-released posthumously by DGC on the Nirvana box set, With the Lights Out, in November 2004, and on the 20th anniversary edition of Nevermind in September 2011. \\"Here She Comes Now\\" occasionally appeared in the band's live set list in 1990 and 1991. A second studio version was recorded during a live, acoustic radio session in Hilversum, the Netherlands on November 25, 1991. The session, which also includes a version of the American folk song \\"Where Did You Sleep Last Night\\" and two original songs, was recorded for the Dutch stations VPRO and VARA. This version of the song appears on numerous bootlegs, but remains officially unreleased. Venus in Furs \\"Venus in Furs\\" was recorded at Razor's Edge Recording in San Francisco, California.

The album was released in October 1973, by Capitol Records. The album marked a period of significant change for the group as the band abandoned their psychedelic- oriented music for a more melodic, smooth rock/blues sound. Perhaps not coincidentally, it was also their first solid commercial success due to the strong radio-play of the title track. The title track took 19 days to record. The album reached No. 2 on the Billboard 200 and has been certified Platinum in the United States. It reached No. 1 on the Cash Box Albums Charts on January 8, 1974. The artwork of the album is also considered amongst the greatest; for example Rolling Stone would later rank it as one of the \\"Top 100 Album Covers Of All Time\\". Reception Stephen Thomas Erlewine of AllMusic rated The Joker three out of five stars, calling it \\"all bright and fun, occasionally truly silly\\".

He studied law at the State University of Louvain, but soon became more interested in ornithology. In 1835 he presented a manuscript to the Royal Academy of Belgium in which described the bird Leptorhynchus pectoralis (the banded stilt). He was a member of parliament for Soignies. He became the first director of the Royal Belgian Institute of Natural Sciences in 1846. On this occasion he donated 2474 birds from his own collection to the museum. In 1860, during the construction of new fortifications around Antwerp he became involved in paleontology. The fossils found were mainly from whales. He also obtained the skeletons from a bowhead whale (Balaena mysticetus) and a young blue whale (Balaenoptera musculus), which are still on display in the museum. In 1860 the skeleton of a mammoth was found near Lier and was brought to the museum (on display since 1869).

The church is dedicated to the Blessed Virgin of Ta' Pinu. The basilica is located in open countryside which allows visitors to enjoy beautiful views of the area and is of great national importance to Gozitans everywhere. History The origins of the Shrine of Our Lady of ta' Pinu are unknown. It was first recorded in the archives of the Curia in Gozo, when the Bishop Domenico Cubelles paid a visit to the chapel. This noted that the chapel had just been rebuilt and that it belonged to the noble family of \\"The Gentile\\". In 1575 the apostolic visitor Pietro Dusina was delegated by Pope Gregory XIII to visit the Maltese Islands. In his pastoral visit to the church, he found that it was in a very bad state. He ordered the church to be closed and demolished and its duties passed to the parish church, now the Cathedral of the Assumption of the Blessed Virgin Mary of Gozo. When demolition began the workman broke his arm while striking the first blow. This was taken as an omen that the chapel should not be demolished. The church was the only chapel on the island to survive Dusina's decree ordering the demolition of other similar chapels. Pinu Gauci became the procurator of the church in 1598 and its name was changed from \\"Of the Gentile\\" to \\"Ta\` Pinu\\", meaning \\"Of Philip\\". In 1611 Gauci offered money for its restoration. It was rebuilt, with a stone altar erected and investments for liturgical services provided. Gauci also commissioned the painting of the Assumption of Our Lady for the main altar. This was done in 1619 by Amadeo Perugino. In 1883, Karmni Grima was walking past the now run down church and heard a voice asking her to recite three Hail Marys'. Over the following years miracles were attributed to the grace of Our Lady of The Assumption to whom the church was dedicated. Francis Portelli also heard the voice coming from the painting. Francis Merċieċa also known as Frenċ tal-Għarb was a devout of Our Lady of ta' Pinu and healed a lot of people in her name. Some of the ex-voto in the Ta' Pinu church. The works for the new church began on 30 May 1922 on the initiative of the church's rector Monsignor Ġużepp Portelli and was consecrated on 31 August 1932. It was built in a neo-romantic style. Inside the church there are 6 mosaics, 76 coloured windows and many ex- voto. The bell tower is 61 metres high.

He played all or part of ten seasons in Major League Baseball (MLB) from 1998 to 2007 for the New York Mets, Florida Marlins, Colorado Rockies, Washington Nationals, Houston Astros and St. Louis Cardinals. He is both the nephew and stepson of former New York Mets outfielder Mookie Wilson. (Mookie married Preston's mother after his brother fathered Preston.) Professional career=New York Mets At age 17, Wilson was drafted by the Mets out of Bamberg-Ehrhardt High School in the first round of the 1992 MLB draft. The Baseball America 1992 High School Player of the Year, Wilson was ranked among the top 100 prospects in baseball by the magazine four times between 1993 and 1998. He is known to be an aggressive hitter, according to scouts and media sources, based on his propensity to swing at the first pitch and his high strikeout rates.Wilson adds punch to Astros, Houston Chronicle After spending five seasons below Triple A and a season in 1998 in the Australian Baseball League with the Hunter Eagles, Wilson finally reached the majors in May 1998. Just two weeks after joining the Mets, he was traded to the Florida Marlins with two other minor leaguers for Mike Piazza. He returned to the minor leagues for most of the season. Florida Marlins In 1999, Wilson was the Marlins' regular center fielder. Wilson led the team in home runs and runs batted in as a rookie, and he finished second in the NL Rookie of the Year balloting to Cincinnati Reds reliever Scott Williamson. The following season, Wilson joined the 30–30 club, slugging 31 home runs and stealing 36 bases. He added 121 RBIs, good for eighth in the National League. In 2000 he led the major leagues in power-speed number (33.3).Progressive Leaders & Records for Power-Speed #  Baseball-Reference.com Wilson also lived up to his reputation as a free swinger, nearly setting a new record for most strikeouts in a season. His total of 187 fell two shy of Bobby Bonds' record at the time. Wilson hit 23 home runs in each of the following two seasons, though his overall production dipped, partially due to missed games. Colorado Rockies After the 2002 season, Wilson was involved in a six-player deal which sent him and three other players to the Colorado Rockies for Juan Pierre and Mike Hampton. Wilson rebounded in 2003, leading the National League with 141 runs batted in. He belted 36 home runs, and was named to his first All-Star team. Bothered by a knee injury in 2004, Wilson was limited to 58 games. Washington Nationals Wilson was acquired by the Washington Nationals in July 2005 for pitcher Zach Day and outfielder J. J. Davis. He led the team in homers and RBIs during the second half of the season, finishing with 25 and 90 respectively. Houston Astros In the 2005 offseason, Wilson signed a one- year deal worth $4 million with the Houston Astros, with a team option of three additional years at $24 million and a buyout of $500,000. Previously a center fielder, Wilson shifted to left since Willy Taveras, the previous season's Rookie of the Year runner-up, was already occupying the position. On April 17, 2006, Wilson set an Astros record by striking out five times in a single game. This tied the MLB record. Despite early struggles, Wilson was batting .284 with 46 RBIs at the 2006 All-Star Break, with the potential for another 100+ RBI season. However, his power numbers were well below his previous years. St. Louis Cardinals The St. Louis Cardinals signed Wilson on August 18, 2006. The Cardinals took another chance on a discarded veteran since veteran center fielder Jim Edmonds was out with post concussion syndrome. Wilson was designated for assignment by Houston on Saturday, August 12, before ultimately being given his release. He joined his new team six days later and was immediately inserted into the starting lineup. Wilson batted sixth and played right field, with Juan Encarnación moving to center field. He made an instant impact for the Redbirds, hitting a home run in an 11–3 rout of the Chicago Cubs on the 18th. The Cardinals went on to become World Champions, giving Wilson a World Series ring, as his stepfather Mookie had in 1986. The Cardinals re-signed Wilson for 2007, but he suffered a knee injury in early May and missed the rest of the 2007 season. After the end of the 2007 season Wilson was released. Wilson generated little interest during spring training 2008, leaving him a free agent.Bloom, Barry M. \\"Big names left out in the cold this spring\\", MLB.com, 2 March 2008.

Sonipat town is the district headquarters. It is a part of National Capital Region. It is bordered by Delhi, Panipat, Rohtak, Jind, Jhajjar and Baghpat (Uttar Pradesh). The district borders Delhi union territory in south, Panipat District in the north, Jind District in the north-west, Uttar Pradesh state in the east with the Yamuna River acting as a border and Rohtak District in the west. Origin of name The district is named after its administrative headquarters, Sonipat. Sonipat was earlier known as Sonprastha, which later became Swarnprastha (Golden City), which is derived from two Sanskrit words, Svarna (Gold) and Prastha (Place). Over a period of time, the classical name Swarnprastha's pronunciation degraded into Svarnpat, and then to its current form, Sonipat. The earliest reference of this city comes in the epic Mahabharata, and at that time, it was one of the five villages demanded by the Pandavas in lieu of the kingdom of Hastinapur. History This district was carved out of the erstwhile Rohtak district on 22 December 1972. Geography Broadly speaking, the entire district is a part of the Punjab plain, but the area is not level in some parts. Over most of the district, the soil is fine loam of rich colour. However, some areas have sandy soil and others Kallar. The plain has a gradual slope to the south and east. The district may be roughly divided into three regions: The Khadar, the upland plain and the sandy region. The Khadar Along the River Yamuna which is a narrow flood plain ranging from 2 to 4 miles in width and is formed by the river along its course. The Khader plain is 20 to 30 ft. lower adjoining upland plain. The soil is fine clay loam left by the receding floods of the Yamuna. Farmers in the Khadar area cultivate rice and sugar cane. Recently, the farmers have started planting Banana, Pappaya and other fruits trees in this area. The upland plain It consists of Sonipat tehsil lying to the west of the Khadar, and is the most extensive of the three regions: The Upland Plain is covered with old alluvium, which if properly irrigated, is highly productive. There is extensive Farming of crops, oil seeds, horticultural plants, vegetables and flowers in this region. The ridges in Gohana tehsil represent the northernmost extension of the Aravallis. The sandy region A much smaller part of the district is covered with soil consisting of sand or sandy loam. Parts of this region have high PH values leading Kallor land. Divisions The district comprises three sub-divisions: Ganaur, Sonipat, and Gohana. They are further divided in four tehsils: Ganaur, Sonipat, Kharkhoda and Gohana. The tehsils of Kharkhoda and Sonipat fall under jurisdiction of Sonipat sub division, while tehsils of Ganaur and Gohana fall under the jurisdiction of their respective sub divisions. These are further divided into seven blocks: Ganaur, Sonipat, Rai, Kharkhoda, Gohana, Kathura and Mundlana. The district comprises 343 villages, out of which 15 are uninhabited. There are six Vidhan Sabha constituencies in this district, namely, Ganaur, Rai, Kharkhauda, Sonipat, Gohana and Baroda. All of these are part of Sonipat Lok Sabha constituency.

In most of its length it is normally a dry creek; it rises in the Wirrabara Forest area and is one of the major tributaries to the Broughton River, which it joins about from the latter's mouth. At Bowman Park there is a permanent spring, and this is probably the 'Crystal' water that Eyre was referring to when he named the stream.

The Sandur hoard of silver coins, dating to the end of the 11th century, attests to the long history of the village. In January 2020 the population stood at 532. The Municipality of Sandur consists of the village of Sandur only. It is the most populous place on the \\"Sand Island\\", and is situated on a peninsula between the lakes of Gróthúsvatn in the northwest and Sandsvatn in the northeast, facing the inlets of Grótvík and Sandsvágur in the south. History Sandur is an old site of the thing where every year the local Várting was held. Excavations here have unearthed a stave church from the 11th century, where today there is a typical Faroese wooden church with grass roof. In 1988 the modern church suffered a devastating fire in which all of the church's silver melted. The fire turned out to be arson. In the following year the church was restored, just in time for its 150th anniversary. The most reliable information of a church in the Faroe Islands is that of Sandur, dating back to the 11th century. In 1863 while extending the churchyard a treasure of silver was found consisting of 98 coins from the 11th century, half of them of German origin. Furthermore in 1989 archaeologists discovered a pagan burial ground from the times of Viking occupation. The burial included the well-preserved skeleton of a woman from the Faroe Islands in a grave 150 cm long. The grave also included three beads of amber, a blue glass bead, and a knife. In the open-air museum of the Danish national museum close to Copenhagen one can see a water-mill which originally, in the 18th century, was installed in Sandur. The local museum Sands Bygdasavn is open in summer. It displays objects of everyday life belonging to the ancestors of the local inhabitants. Transport and tourism Sandur can be reached from Tórshavn via the ferry ports Gamlarætt and Skopun. From there along the lake Sandsvatn on Road 30 to Sandur. All villages on the island can be reached by bus from Sandur. They are therefore suitable for day trips. Due to the topography of the island walking-tours are suitable for casual strolling and cyclists. Popular trips are to Søltuvík on the west coast, Skarvanes in the south (with slightly more demanding hiking) and Húsavík on the east coast. The small passenger only ferry MV Sildberin departs Sandur for Skúvoy, an island to the south. Particularly interesting is the tour in the Faroese rowboat Hvíthamar from Sandur to the bird rocks on the west coast or to Skúvoy. Boatbuilder Jóan Petur Clementsen himself is rowing. The campsite á Munkinum is one of the camping sites on Sandoy. The other two camping sites are in Húsavík and Dalur. In addition Sandsvatn and Gróthúsvatn are attractive places for fishing. The Hotel Ísansgarður has been reconstructed. The tourist information in Sandur provides up-to-date information on private accommodation and holiday homes. ClimateSands Listasavn Art Museum The Art Museum of Sandur is open from May to October every day except for Monday from 14:00-16:00. In wintertime it is open Sundays from 14:00-16:00. The museum and the art works in it were a present from Sofus Olsen. It was built in 2005 and handed over to the municipality of Sandur in December 2005, on Mr Olsen's 92nd birthday. Sport Sandur is best known for its football club, B71 Sandoy, which has enjoyed modest success in both the Faroe Islands Premier League and UEFA.

It has been running for about a decade. This show was inspired by the 1997 British film Full Monty. Sólo Para Mujeres came after the success of its predecessor, Sólo Para Hombres (For Men Only), a play that starred Lorena Herrera, among others, and which came about after Herrera's participation in the famous telenovela, Dos Mujeres, un Camino. Sólo Para Hombres featured Herrera and other famous Mexican actresses dancing on stage with scant outfits. Sólo Para Mujeres followed the same lines: muscular actors would dance, for an audience that consists mainly of women, wearing underwear only or suggestive clothing. Although Televisa is not directly connected with the play, many of the actors on Sólo Para Mujeres have had previous experience acting in soap operas for the largest Mexican television network. Among those are Alexis Ayala, Jorge Salinas, Sergio Sendel, Alfonso de Nigris and the play's producer, Sergio Mayer. Former Menudo Johnny Lozada also participated at the play for a number of years. The play was not expected to be as successful as Sólo Para Hombres was: Mexico, as with most of Latin America, still has a society with relatively machista views, and so the first expectations for Sólo Para Mujeres were that it would last, at most, a couple of years. The play managed, however, to outlast Sólo Para Hombres.

Many among the public are clamoring for a full investigation of the incident. Among some publicly expressed doubts are the fact that the street had not been closed before the filming of the video, and also that the members of Sólo Para Mujeres were not provided with protective helmets before getting on their motorcycles. Also, driving motorcycles on the street where the tragedy happened is prohibited by the law. Members of the play declared that it was not of their knowledge that driving motorcycles was prohibited on the particular street where the tragedy happened, because they had passed there on their bikes before and no one had admonished them for it. On the other hand, the man who drove the car into the motorcycles was released on bond until the case is seen at a Mexican court. Mayer demonstrated great displeasure when given the news that that man was not in jail anymore.

The area, thought to contain considerable amounts of natural gas and mineral resources, was the center of a long-term border dispute between the two countries that erupted into an armed conflict on two occasions (in 1974 and 1985). Background Both Mali and Burkina Faso thought that the Agacher Strip contained substantial natural resources and hoped that these resources would help improve their dire economic situations. Some observers believe that the dispute may have been deliberately provoked to divert attention from domestic problems brought on by the return of military rule in Burkina Faso (then Upper Volta) and the growing unpopularity of Moussa Traoré's military regime in Mali. Early skirmishes The dispute between the two countries first erupted into an armed conflict on 25 November 1974. The conflict involved only a few border skirmishes with exchanges of small arms-fire in late November and mid-December 1974. Notably, there was a lack of military operations and significant fighting; casualties on both sides were minimal. As tensions escalated, mediation efforts by President Gnassingbé Eyadéma of Togo and President Seyni Kountché of Niger to resolve the conflict proved unsuccessful. Sporadic clashes continued into early 1975 with numerous reprisals against Malians in Upper Volta, prompting the Organization of African Unity to create a commission to mediate the crisis. The organization recommended that a neutral technical commission be created to demarcate the boundary. Both countries accepted this proposal at a meeting held on 18 June 1975, in Lomé, Togo. Beginning in 1977, Upper Volta and Mali engaged in political mediation through the Non-Aggression and Defense Aid Agreement (ANAD), a regional West African group. Christmas War (1985) In 1983, military captain Thomas Sankara seized power in Burkina Faso in a coup and was tasked with resolving the country's many problems, including the Agacher Strip dispute. Negotiations between Sankara, Malian President Traoré, and the countries' top diplomats were strained. Additionally, under Sankara's rule, Burkina Faso expelled Drissa Keita, a Malian diplomat, further deteriorating bilateral relations. Some Burkina Faso newspapers accused Mali of preparing an invasion; Mali rejected the accusations and accused Burkina Faso of escalating tensions. By 1985, both countries experienced several years of drought. Rainfall finally arrived in late 1985 but washed out the roads, hindering the distribution of food and medical supplies to the Agacher region. During this period, the Burkina Faso government organized a nationwide census. The census agents visited Fula camps in Mali, which sparked outrage from the Malian government, who saw it as a violation of their sovereignty. Reports about Burkina Faso ground troops present in the Agacher Strip also upset Mali because, although Burkina Faso believed they had sovereignty over the area, no formal deal had been made up to that point. Traoré publicly denounced the act and campaigned for African leaders to pressure Sankara. However, the Burkina Faso soldiers did not leave the area, escalating tensions further. On 25 December 1985, the Malian military launched several ground attacks against Burkina Faso border posts and police stations. The Burkina Faso army responded by mobilizing soldiers in the region and launching counterattacks. However, the Malian army, which was better prepared and organized, conducted many successful assaults that captured several of the villages and outposts. The Libyan government attempted to negotiate a ceasefire on 26 December, but negotiations failed. The war culminated in an airstrike by the Malian Air Force on a marketplace in Ouahigouya, in which a number of civilians were killed. A second ceasefire instigated by the governments of Nigeria and Libya on 29 December also failed. The countries agreed to a third ANAD-sponsored truce on 30 December, finally ending what became known as the \\"Christmas War.\\" Estimates of the total number of casualties from the war range from 59 to 300 people. Post-war In mid-January 1986, at a Non-Aggression and Defense Aid Agreement summit in Yamoussoukro, Ivory Coast, presidents Moussa Traoré of Mali and Thomas Sankara of Burkina Faso agreed to withdraw their troops to pre-war positions. Prisoners of War were exchanged in February and full diplomatic relations were restored in June. Despite this, the dispute remained unresolved. The case was taken to the International Court of Justice. In the ICJ's judgement delivered on 22 December 1986, the court split the of disputed territory almost equally. Mali received the western portion and Burkina Faso the eastern. President Traoré called the settlement \\"very satisfying\\" and a victory for the \\"brother peoples\\" of Mali and Burkina Faso.

The first few sporadic simple groups were discovered by Émile Léonard Mathieu, which were then called the Mathieu groups. It was after 90 years of the discovery of the last Mathieu group that Zvonimir Janko constructed a new sporadic simple group in 1964. In his honour, this group is now called J1. This discovery launched the modern theory of sporadic groups and it was an important milestone in the classification of finite simple groups. Biography Janko was born in Bjelovar, Croatia. He studied at the University of Zagreb where he received Ph.D. in 1960, with advisor Vladimir Devidé. The title of the thesis was Dekompozicija nekih klasa nedegeneriranih Rédeiovih grupa na Schreierova proširenja (Decomposition of some classes of nondegenerate Rédei Groups on Schreier extensions), in which he solved a problem posed by László Rédei. He then taught physics at a high school in Široki Brijeg in Bosnia and Herzegovina. In 1962 Janko decided to leave Yugoslavia for Australia, where he first taught at Monash University in Melbourne. In 1964 he joined as full professor the Australian National University in Canberra. He then moved in 1968 to the United States, where he first was a visiting professor at Princeton University, and then full professor at the Ohio State University. In 1970 he was an invited speaker at the International Congress of Mathematicians in Nice. In 1972 Janko moved to Germany, where he was a full professor at Heidelberg University until his retirement in 2000. Janko discovered his first sporadic simple group (called J1) in 1964, when he was at the Australian National University. This was followed in 1966 by the prediction of J2, whose existence was established in 1968 by Marshall Hall and David Wales, and J3, whose existence was established in 1969 by Graham Higman and John McKay. Finally, Janko found the group J4 in 1975; its existence was confirmed in 1980 by Simon P. Norton and others using computer calculations.

It is a transfer point between 18 Massachusetts Bay Transportation Authority (MBTA) bus routes, including two Silver Line bus rapid transit lines and 16 local MBTA bus routes. Like all MBTA bus stops, Nubian is fully accessible. The original Dudley Square station opened in 1901 as a BERy Main Line Elevated station. The last segment of the original Main Line Elevated, the Washington Street Elevated (including Dudley station), closed in 1987; six years later, Dudley was converted into its modern configuration. Silver Line service began in 2002. The station was renamed Nubian in June 2020, following the 2019 renaming of the square. Nubian is a contributing property in the Dudley Station Historic District, which was added to the National Register of Historic Places in 1985. History Looking north at the former elevated station's northbound platforms in 1904, with the streetcar loops on each side; an elevated train can be seen in the station, while a streetcar is visible using the right-hand loop and another is using the street-level tracks beneath the left-hand loop. Original station The Boston Elevated Railway opened its Main Line Elevated on June 10, 1901. The line ran from Sullivan Square on the Charlestown Elevated, through the Tremont Street subway, and on the Washington Street Elevated to a southern terminal located at Dudley Square. Along with the rest of the Washington Street Elevated, Dudley Street Terminal was designed by Alexander Wadsworth Longfellow, Jr.. It featured a Beaux Arts-style waiting area, clad in copper with an internal arched structure. Like many BERy stations, Dudley Street Terminal was designed for efficient transfers between streetcars and subway trains. Many streetcar routes that had operated to downtown (some into the Tremont Street subway) were curtailed to Dudley, where two elevated loops offered cross-platform transfers to Main Line trains, using platforms on both sides of the northbound track. Other streetcars - largely on crosstown routes that did not terminate at Dudley - stopped at street-level platforms underneath the elevated station. On December 2, 1905, the Old Colony Street Railway began operating through service between Dudley and Quincy. Modifications and decline Plan of the lower level in 1949, after changes to support trolleybus operations The Washington Street Elevated was extended south to Forest Hills on November 22, 1909. The loop allowing trains to return downtown from Dudley was kept (as some trains were short-turned at Dudley), and a new southbound platform was added. In 1910, the elevated streetcar loops were expanded and roofed to handle larger-than-expected crowds. Dudley quickly became overcrowded; in 1917, a streetcar transfer area was built at Egleston to the south and some streetcar routes diverted there. As streetcar routes were bustituted during the 1940s and 1950s, the streetcar platforms were modified for use by buses and trackless trolleys. The east loop was completely rebuilt over a six-month period for trolleybus operations, reopening on December 25, 1948. The Main Line Elevated was renamed the Orange Line in 1967. From 1979 to 1987, the Southwest Corridor was rebuilt, with 2 Orange Line and 3 commuter rail tracks in a trench replacing a 4-track embankment. Trains last ran on the Elevated on April 30, 1987, and the relocated Orange Line opened on May 4, 1987. Modern reuse A Silver Line bus at Dudley Street Terminal in 2016. After plans for light rail, ultimately the Silver Line bus service replaced the Elevated. Even without the Elevated, Dudley Square remained a major bus transfer location. After several years, the former Elevated station was converted into a new bus station. The station building was lowered to the ground and rolled to the south. The original station building covers north–south oriented bus platforms A, B, and C; new shelters in a similar style were built for east–west platforms D, E, and F. When completed in late 1993, the new Dudley Square bus station served over 10,000 daily passengers, with over 100 buses per hour stopping at peak times. When the Washington Street Elevated was removed, the MBTA originally promised to run light rail service over its former route. After 15 years of debate and changing plans, the Washington Street section of the Silver Line bus rapid transit system opened on July 20, 2002. It ran between Dudley and Downtown Crossing, replacing the 49 bus (albeit with increased frequency and other rapid-transit- like features). On October 13, 2009, this service was re-designated the SL5; a new SL4 service was added between Dudley and South Station, sharing most of the route of the SL4. With the December 2019 renaming of Dudley Square to Nubian Square, community leaders stated they would seek to have the station renamed. In February 2020, the MBTA agreed to rename the station to Nubian Square. The renaming took effect in June 2020. Future plans Dudley was also a proposed stop on the MBTA's planned Urban Ring Project. The Urban Ring was to be a bus rapid transit (BRT) Line designed to connect the current MBTA Lines to reduce strain on the downtown stations. The project is currently shelved due to financial difficulties and questions about spending priorities. The closing of the Washington Street Elevated in 1987, which also closed the Dudley Square elevated station, prompted a 2012 review; the Roxbury- Dorchester-Mattapan Transit Needs Study, recommended for some form of proposed replacement rail service to access southern Metro Boston neighborhoods—one option being studied within this review would re-use the Tremont Street subway's now-unused southern Pleasant Street tunnel coming from the Green Line's Boylston station to eventually run a light rail line to, and likely beyond Nubian Square to the south. The new light rail service proposed in the 2012 review, to replace the rapid transit access the Elevated previously provided, could go from Nubian Square as far south as the Red Line's Mattapan station, with a northern turnaround terminus at Government Center.

The son of a Christian democratic politician and diplomat, he studied business engineering at the Pontifical Catholic University of Chile and economics at the Harvard University. He had an estimated net worth of 2.8 billion dollars in 2019 according to Forbes, making him one of the richest people in Chile. A member of the right National Renewal party, he served as a senator for the East Santiago district from 1990 to 1998, running for the presidency in the 2005 election, which he lost to Michelle Bachelet, and again, successfully, in 2010. As a result, he became the first conservative president to be democratically elected since 1958, and the first to hold the office since the departure of Augusto Pinochet in 1990.  Family  Piñera is the sixth child of the marriage between José Piñera Carvallo and Magdalena Echenique Rozas. Among his ancestors on his maternal side is his mother's great-great-grandmother, Luisa Pinto Garmendia, the sister of President Aníbal Pinto Garmendia and daughter of President Francisco Antonio Pinto and Luisa Garmendia Alurralde, who was a descendant of the penultimate Inca emperor, Huayna Capac.Retamal Favereau, Julio; Celis Atria, Carlos; y Muñoz Correa, Juan Guillermo – \\"Familias Fundadoras de Chile, 1540–1600\\", Editorial Universitaria, Santiago, 1992. pg. 789 He is a nephew of the former oldest living Roman Catholic bishop in the world, Bernardino Piñera, who died in 2020 due to complications from Covid-19.  Education  Piñera's family moved to Belgium one year after his birth and later to New York City, where his father was the Chilean ambassador to the United Nations. Piñera returned to Chile in 1955 and enrolled in the Colegio del Verbo Divino (\\"Divine Word College\\"), from which he graduated in 1967. Universia Sebastián Piñera Perfil Piñera then matriculated at the Pontifical Catholic University of Chile, from which he graduated in 1971 with an undergraduate degree in commercial engineering. Upon graduation, he was awarded the Raúl Iver Oxley Prize, which is given to the best overall student of each class.. Piñera continued on to Harvard University on a partial Fulbright Program for postgraduate studies in economics. During his time at Harvard, Piñera and a classmate coauthored an article, \\"The Old South's Stake in the Inter-Regional Movement of Slaves\\", for the Journal of Economic History. After three years at Harvard, Piñera graduated with both an M.A. and PhD in Economics.  Teaching career  Piñera was an economics lecturer from 1971 until 1988 at the University of Chile, the Pontifical Catholic University of Chile, and Adolfo Ibáñez University. In 1971, he was in charge of Economic Political Theory in the School of Economics at the University of Chile and in 1972, at the Valparaiso Business School.  Foundations  In 1989, with Cecilia Morel, Danica Radic, and Paula Délano, Piñera created the Enterprising Women Foundation (Fundación Mujer Emprende), originally called The House of Youth (La Casa de la Juventud). The foundation aims to assist in the development of young women of lower income. Fundacion Mujer Emprende Quienes Somos In 1973, Piñera created the foundation Fundación Futuro, of which he is president and whose directors are Cristián Boza D., María Teresa Chadwick P., Hugo Montes B., Cecilia Morel M., Renato Poblete S.J., and Fabio Valdés C. The head director of the foundation is Magdalena Piñera. The foundation's mission is to help in Chile's development of justice, freedom and democracy. Fundanción Futuro Quienes Somos The foundation was renamed Fundación Cultura y Sociedad after Piñera was elected president. Terra Semana clave para fundación a la que Piñera traspasará propiedad de Chilevisión Under the Fundación Cultura y Sociedad (formerly Fundación Futuro), the Grupo Tantauco has the mission of environmentalism, and is administered by Juan Carlos Urquidi. It was created to support the proposals Piñera plans to institute during his presidency. Piñera2010 Conoce las propuestas medioambientales del Grupo Tantauco In 2005, Piñera created Tantauco Park (Spanish: Parque Tantauco), a 1,180 km2 (456 sq mi) private natural reserve he bought and owns on the south end of Chiloé Island, in order to protect 118,000 hectares of the region's unique ecosystem. His foundation runs the park, which is open to the public and is an ecotourist location. In fact, Piñera bought the 118,000 hectares in Chiloé through an offshore company in Panama. He has faced pressure to cede eight hectares to 16 indigenous families whose presence pre-dates Piñera's purchase and who have spent years negotiating to obtain title to their familial lands. An additional project, Grupo Tantauco: Derechos Humanos, was proposed in hopes of beginning a reconciliation between the Chilean people who suffered human rights violations during Augusto Pinochet's dictatorship. Piñera2010 Grupo Tantauco: Derechos Humanos  Businesses  Before entering politics, he was a businessman. Piñera was general manager of the Banco de Talca. In 1982, a warrant was issued for his arrest on charges of violating banking law. Piñera spent 24 days in hiding while his lawyers appealed the order. A writ of habeas corpus, first rejected by the Appeals Court but then approved by the Supreme Court, acquitted Piñera. Piñera once owned 90% of Chilevisión (a terrestrial television channel broadcasting nationwide). He also owned 27% of LAN Airlines (LAN); 13% of Colo-Colo, a football (soccer) club; and other minor stock positions in companies such as Quiñenco, Enersis, and Soquimich. In July 2007, Piñera was fined approximately US$680,000 by Chile's securities regulator (SVS) for not withdrawing a purchase order after receiving privileged information (an infraction similar to insider trading) of LAN Airlines stock in mid-2006.Ethisphere Magazine: Insider Trading Later that month, he resigned from the boards of LAN and Quintec. To avoid a conflict of interest he sold Chilevisión for $160 million in 2010 to Time Warner. He also sold his shares of LAN in several rounds between February and March 2010, as well as his stake in Colo-Colo. Piñera has built an estimated fortune of $US2.8 billion , according to Forbes magazine. His wealth is greatly due to his involvement in introducing credit cards to Chile in the late 1970s and his subsequent investments, mainly in LAN Airlines stock. Piñera acquired shares of the formerly state-owned company from Scandinavian Airlines in 1994, as part of a joint venture with the Cueto family.\\"LAN Airlines 2007 annual report, p. 29\\" .  Political career  In 1988 as Pinochet had lost the referendum and Chile was returning to democracy Piñera offered his support for the Christian Democrat Eduardo Frei Ruiz-Tagle in his pre-candidacy for president. In 1998, Piñera opposed the arrest and detention of Augusto Pinochet, in London, initiated by Baltasar Garzón, arguing that it was an attack on the sovereignty and dignity of Chile.Piñera y su acalorado apoyo a Pinochet en 1998 . La Nación, 10 de diciembre de 2009 (part of the speech can be seen at ). On 14 May 2005, in a surprise move Piñera announced his candidacy for the 2005 presidential election (RN was supposed to support UDI's Lavín.) He has described his political philosophy as Christian humanism.  Presidential elections of 2009–2010  Piñera celebrates victory alongside wife and family in 2010. Piñera ran for President of Chile in the 2009–2010 election. Since August 2009, he led in opinion polls, competing with Eduardo Frei Ruiz-Tagle, Marco Enríquez-Ominami and Jorge Arrate; all of whom are left-of-center candidates. In 13 December 2009 election, Piñera placed first in the results with 44.05% of the votes, while Frei placed second with 29.6% of the votes. Neither candidate received more than half of the total votes; therefore, according to the Constitution, Chileans returned to the polls for a final run-off election on Sunday, 17 January 2010. That evening, the third and final preliminary results were announced by the Undersecretary of the Interior. These showing accounted for 99.77% of the total ballot boxes. Of the votes, Piñera received 51.61% and Frei received 48.39%. Republica de Chile Votación Candidatos por País Piñera meeting with Michelle Bachelet during the presidential transition Piñera invested an estimated 13.6 million USD in his presidential campaign, which included items such as a campaign anthem and \\"Thank You\\" banners. Piñera's banners and billboards have carried statements throughout the country such as \\"Delinquents, your party is over,\\" and \\"Small businesses, Big opportunities\\". Piñera's campaign released a featuring a male gay couple, something never seen before in a presidential campaign run in Chile. Amongst his promises were increasing education rates and improving international relations with the neighboring country of Perú. Piñera's victory meant a shift towards the right, breaking two-decades of center-left political leadership and becoming the first elected right-wing leader in 52 years.PBS Newshour Chile Elects First Right-Wing President in 52 Years On 28 January, Piñera suspended his membership in National Renewal, becoming unofficially an independent.

The option above finally did not take place, Piñera decided to sell the TV station, and after a failed attempt in May 2010 with the Linzor Capital investment fund, the President announced it sold Chilevisión to Time Warner, in late August 2010. Piñera said he won't sell his 12.5% stake in Blanco y Negro, company that owns the nation's popular soccer team Colo-Colo. He has stated, \\"We want big things and not only achieve local victories.

First presidency (2010–2014)  Piñera receives the presidential sash from Senate President Jorge Pizarro at the National Congress of Chile on 11 March 2010. Piñera's official portrait for his first term as president Piñera was sworn in as the 34th President of the Republic of Chile on 11 March 2010, in a ceremony held in a plenary session of the National Congress in Valparaíso. In the same ceremony, Piñera's Cabinet ministers were sworn in. The ceremony was also marked by a 6.9 Mw earthquake and subsequent aftershocks that upset the invitees. Shortly after, the National Congress building was evacuated due to a tsunami alert that proved to be false a couple of hours later. On 12 October 2010, Piñera rallied his countrymen in the rescue of 33 trapped miners, all of whom were rescued after 70 days following a mining accident. \\"Chile will never be the same\\", he said to the miners' foreman, Luis Urzúa, as he (the last of the miners to emerge from the cavern) greeted Piñera, in a broadcast carried live across the globe. Despite much goodwill in Chile following this, many Chileans are still waiting on Piñera to rectify anti-terrorism laws in Chile which effectively mean the indigenous Mapuche people can be dealt with as \\"terrorists\\". This matter has led to hunger strikes which started before the mining disaster, and are set to continue afterwards. Council of Ministers in Chile's Palacio de Cerro Castillo In January 2011 he faced the protest in Magallanes Region in response to a proposed increase in the price of natural gas there by 16.8%. The protests left more than two thousand cars isolated while trying to cross from the Argentine province of Tierra del Fuego to the province of Santa Cruz through Chilean territory. Another 1,500 tourists were left without movement in Torres del Paine National Park after routes to Puerto Natales and El Calafate were cut.

Amidst the severe 2011 Chilean student protests Piñera shuffled his cabinet and removed Joaquín Lavín from the post of minister of education. With respect to the protest, Piñera has defended for- profit activity in education and proposed to legalize it, rejecting the students' demands for the public ownership of educational establishments. During August 2011, Piñera's public approval declined precipitously amidst continuous protests, to the extent that some polls indicated that he was the least popular Chilean leader since Augusto Pinochet. His approval ratings dropped to as low as 22% according to a CERC survey.http://www.cerc.cl As such, Piñera's chances of passing sought reforms were seen as remote.Teen shot in Chile anti-Piñera protest dies Financial Times. 26 August 2011. 26 August 2011 As president, Piñera expressed support for the Argentine claim on the Falkland Islands, referring to \\"the unrenounceable rights of Argentina on the islands\\".Chile y las Malvinas, Juan Gabriel Valdés.

In March 2012, Piñera visited Vietnam with the intention of increasing cooperation between the two countries in general and with Ho Chi Minh City, Vietnam's most populous and largest economic hub, in particular. HCM City also called for a Chilean sister city while receiving Piñera on 23 March. The visit included the signing of a bilateral trade agreement and several cooperation pacts in education, tourism, culture and finance. Criticism Levels of approval (blue) and disapproval (red) of Piñera's term from 2010 to 2014, according to the Adimark survey. Piñera left office in March 2014 with an approval rating of 50% Early in 2012 physicist Frank Duarte sharply criticized Piñera's performance in the handling of the Chilean–Peruvian maritime dispute at The Hague, deemed as favoring commercial interests over the interest of the Chilean people, and called for Chile's withdrawal from The Hague. Following the adverse ruling against Chile in 2014, several political figures in Chile, from a variety of political parties, also called for Chile's withdrawal from The Hague that would, in addition, imply a withdrawal from the Pact of Bogota. In December 2011 during a state visit to Mexico a joke made by Piñera where he compared women with politicians caused uproar in Chile, sparking criticism from his own minister Carolina Schmidt who said of the joke that it was \\"hurting to many women\\".Ministra Schmidt por broma de Piñera: \\"El chiste no sólo es fome, sino que hiriente para muchas mujeres\\", La Tercera.

The Chilean Network Against Domestic and Sexual Violence called the joke \\"misogynic\\" and \\"a shame for the whole country\\". Previously on a state visit to Peru in 2011 Piñera received criticism for his informal style after he revealed to Peruvian president-elect Ollanta Humala that he was a descendant of the Inca Huayna Capac. Senator Jorge Pizarro criticized Piñera's comment to Ollanta Humala, calling for more careful and respectful attitudes.

Piñera took office for a second time on 11 March 2018, succeeding the outgoing Michelle Bachelet. Environmental NGOs accuse the government of yielding to pressure from the mining lobby in an attempt to thwart any draft legislation. In 2018, Sebastián Piñera buried an initiative to ban industrial activities near glaciers. In 2019, a draft law from the ranks of the opposition caused tensions. It is supposed to convert glaciers and their surrounding environment \\"into protected areas, prohibiting any intervention except scientific and that can benefit sustainable tourism\\". At least 44 mining projects are likely to be completed between 2019 and 2028. In May 2018, his government adopted \\"The Women's Agenda\\" in response to massive feminist demonstrations, which combined a conservative social vision and economic liberalism. Cabinet In January 2018, Piñera unveiled his cabinet to harsh criticism: his interior minister, Andrés Chadwick, was a vocal supporter of Pinochet dictatorship, which had previously appointed him president of the Catholic University Students Federation. In 2012 Chadwick expressed \\"deep repentance\\" for this support after discovering \\"over the years\\" serious human rights violations committed by the dictatorship, while defending the regime on other grounds. Chadwick and justice minister Hernán Larraín were also \\"supporters and defenders of the secretive German enclave Colonia Dignidad, which was established by the fugitive Nazi officer and paedophile Paul Schäfer in the early 60s\\". Colonia Dignidad was used by Pinochet security officials to torture and murder opponents of the regime. Other appointees with ties to the Pinochet includes mining minister Baldo Prokurica, a governor in the Pinochet government. Response to 2019–2020 Chilean protests Following widespread protests that broke out across Chile in October 2019, due to a poor economy, Piñera declared a state of emergency on 18 October, authorizing the deployment of the Chilean Army across the main regions to enforce order and prevent the destruction of public property, and invoked before the courts the Ley de Seguridad del Estado (\\"State Security Law\\") against dozens of detainees. As a result, Piñera has been heavily criticized, decreasing his approval ratio down to 9% by 24 October, according to a poll by Active Research., although it slowly recovered back up to 13% by 1 June 2020, against 73% disapproval. This consistent low level of support has been attributed to losing support from officials due to failure to restore order and enforce the rule of law. On 12 December 2019 the National Congress rejected an opposition led motion to impeach him. The impeachment resolution accused him of failure to protect human rights in relation to the protests. In response to the unrest Piñera removed Chadwick as Interior and Public Security Minister on 28 October 2019 assigning instead Gonzalo Blumel. On 11 December Chadwick was impeached for his role in the protests, including the many eye injuries attained by protesters. Chadwick is effectively banned to hold public office for five years. Response to COVID-19 Pandemic Under Piñera's leadership, Chile has had one of the largest outbreaks of COVID-19 in the world. As of 2 July 2020, it has had recorded 284,541 cases of COVID-19 and 5,920 deaths from COVID-19https://www.worldometers.info/coronavirus/country/chile/, the third- highest totals for each in South America. Only Brazil and Peru have more of each.https://gisanddata.maps.arcgis.com/apps/opsdashboard/index.html#/bda7594740fd40299423467b48e9ecf6 In response, Piñera has banned events with more than 500 peoplehttps://www.reuters.com/article/us-health-coronavirus-chile/chile-bans- large-public-events-over-coronavirus-fears-ahead-of-planned-protests- idUSKBN21102N and issued lockdown orders in certain areas of the country, most notably the Santiago Metropolitan Regionhttps://www.cnnchile.com/pais/cuarentena-total-38-comunas-region- metropolitana-iquique-alto-hospicio_20200513/  Public image  Piñera has often publicly been associated with bad luck.Piñera y los presidentes tachados de \\"mala suerte\\". BBC. The BBC has listed a series of situations of \\"bad luck\\" concerning Piñera's presidency: the 2010 Maule earthquake followed by another quake during Piñera's inauguration ceremony, the mining accident of 2010, the 2010 Santiago prison fire, the 2011 Puyehue-Cordón Caulle eruption and the 2012 wildfires. José Mujica, president of Uruguay, stated Piñera's low approval ratings might be caused by a lack of \\"glamour\\". In April 2012 The Economist described Piñera as being considered an \\"inept politician\\" by both the opposition and supporters.Progress and its discontents. The Economist' The Chilean government responded by stating that The Economist's comment was disrespectful. His lapses, errors and inconveniences have been labelled \\"piñericosas\\" in Chile. In June 2013, after visiting President Obama in the White House, he said, \\"I'm going to sit at the President of the United States' desk,\\" breaking the White House's political protocols. Alfredo Moreno Charme, Minister of Foreign Affairs, said \\"How many other presidents have done the same?\\" and Obama responded, \\"This is the only one,\\" causing laughter between those there. Piñera then justified his abrupt actions by stating his daughter was born in the United States. Use of bellicose rhetoric  During the 2019–20 Chilean protests Piñera made himself known for the use of a bellicose language. When Piñera addressed the nation on the evening of 20 October during the height of the unrest he remarked that the country was \\"at war with a powerful and relentless enemy\\" and announced that the state of emergency would be extended across much of the country. Some opposition politicians described his rhetoric as \\"irresponsible\\", while a Latin America editor for BBC News Online expressed concern about the impact his words would have on the protesters and on the chances for meaningful dialogue. Hours shortly after the President's speech, chief of national defense Javier Iturriaga del Campo spoke against this declaration, asserting that he was \\"content\\" and \\"not at war with anyone\\". However the use of bellicose rhetoric can be traced back to at least 2018 when Piñera began his second government. He has referred to a variety of subjects like drug trafficking, terrorism and organised crime as a \\"powerful and relentless enemies\\". Besides this Piñera has made frequent use of words like \\"battle\\", \\"conquest\\", \\"defeat\\" and \\"combat\\" in his verbal communication. The use of such language is not unique to Piñera but has also been heard from European right-wing populists and George W. Bush. According to economist Carlos Tromben who studied the political discourse of Piñera, the aim of this rhetoric is to rally the nation behind what is perceived as a common interest, but the success of this has been variable. Tromben also views the bellicose rhetoric as a defensive communicational strategy aimed to gain time for a \\"counterattack\\".  Personal life  Piñera and Morel in February 2012 Piñera married Cecilia Morel in 1973. They were neighbours in the Avenida Américo Vespucio, Santiago. They have four children, born in 1975, 1978, 1982 and 1984. All of them have university degrees. Piñera is also a member of Washington D.C.-based think tank, the Inter-American Dialogue.

It originally aired on the Fox network in the United States on May 15, 2005. Originally supposed to air April 10, the episode was dropped from the week's schedule due to the death of Pope John Paul II, since this episode revolved around Catholicism.It was replaced by On a Clear Day I Can't See My Sister which aired as scheduled later that night. Our Favorite Simpsons Episode: The Father, the Son, and the Holy Guest Star, Bingohall.com This episode is also the 350th episode in production order (in broadcast order, \\"Future-Drama\\" is the 350th episode). Plot Springfield Elementary School is holding its medieval festival. All the students are given roles: Lisa is queen, Martin is king, and Bart is the cooper. Bart is mad about his role and is treated terribly by everyone, especially Lisa. Against his will, Groundskeeper Willie is chosen to play the village idiot, and seeking revenge for his cruel treatment, Willie unleashes a pie with hundreds of rats inside. Bart is blamed for this prank and is expelled from school. After looking through other schools, Marge decides to enroll Bart in St. Jerome's Catholic School. There, Bart's hip, rebel attitude is frowned upon. While holding out two dictionaries as a punishment, Bart meets Father Sean (voiced by Liam Neeson), who converted to Catholicism after he was beaten by his father and St. Peter told him to repent. He is sympathetic to Bart and gives him a comic book about the saints, and he is drawn into it. At home, Marge becomes concerned over Bart's interest in the Catholic Church, mainly due to the Catholic ban on birth control. Lisa incorrectly calls Latin 'the language of Plutarch' (who actually wrote in Greek). Homer goes to the school to confront Father Sean, but reconsiders after having a pancake dinner and playing Bingo. After an expansive confession session, and discovering that becoming a Catholic involves more than just bashing Unitarians, Homer decides to convert to Catholicism as well to be absolved of his sins. With Bart and Homer both considering joining the Church, Marge (worried she might be alone in Protestant Heaven while Bart and Homer are in Catholic Heaven and Lisa possibly in nirvana) seeks help from Rev. Lovejoy and Ned Flanders, who agree to get them back. While they are learning about First Communion, Marge, Lovejoy and Ned capture Bart. On the road, Marge, Ned and Lovejoy try to bring Bart back to the \\"one true faith\\": The Western Branch of American Reform Presbylutheranism. Back at the house, Lisa agrees with Homer and Bart's desire to join a new faith. Even after getting laughed at for being Buddhist by Fr. Sean, she says that Marge is taking Bart to a Protestant Youth Festival. Homer and Fr. Sean then leave in hot pursuit. At the Festival, Marge fails to bribe Bart with the Christian rock of Quiet Riot (Pious Riot after their conversion). However, he agrees after he plays some paintball. Homer and Fr. Sean arrive with a motorcycle, shoot Marge's hair with some paintball bullets and engage in a Mexican standoff with Ned and Lovejoy. Bart says it is stupid that all the different forms of Christianity are feuding, explaining that the few stupid things they disagree on are nothing compared to the many stupid things they agree on. The two groups agree to both fight monogamist gays and stem cells and to take Bart's idea to heart. The episode then jumps 1,000 years into the future, when Bart is believed to be the last Prophet of God. In this age, mankind is waging war over whether Bart's teachings were about love and tolerance, or understanding and peace (and whether he was betrayed by his minion Milhouse and ripped apart by snowmobiles until he died). Unable to come to an agreement, one side cries Bart's catchphrase \\"Eat my shorts\\", the other cries \\"Cowabunga\\" and both sides engage in a bloody battle. Cultural references * While discussing Bart's future education prospects at the dinner table, Homer remarks that Bart will join the Army if he continues to get expelled from school, at which point Homer follows up by saying \\"... where you'll be sent to America's next military quagmire. Where will it be? North Korea? Iran? Anything's possible with commander coo-coo bananas in charge\\". Homer both implicitly references the Bush Doctrine on preemptive strike and the Axis of Evil – a term used by President Bush to denote the nation-states of Iraq, Iran and North Korea. At the time of the episode was being aired, US forces were still fighting in Iraq. Commander coo-coo bananas was a reference to President Bush. * When Rev. Lovejoy and Ned arrive at St. Jerome's to pick up Bart, Lovejoy refers to Sean as \\"Popey Le Pew\\", a reference to cartoon character Pepé Le Pew. * Rev. Lovejoy is seen driving a van called the \\"Ministry Machine\\", a parody of the Mystery Machine from the Scooby-Doo franchise and painted in a similar psychedelic colour scheme. * During the \\"Catholic Heaven\\" sequence, Catholic Heaven's inhabitants all spontaneously break into a rendition of Riverdance, led by a Michael Flatley lookalike. * At one point, Father Sean remarks that \\"if I let Bart go, I'll be the worst Catholic priest ever...well, except for...you know...\\" followed by an awkward silence, a thinly-veiled reference to the ongoing allegations of sexual abuse in the Catholic church. Reception Robert Canning, Eric Goldman, Dan Iverson, and Brain Zormski of IGN called this episode the best episode of the sixteenth season. They thought of it as a great episode that dealt with the sensitive topic of religious tolerance, stating that \\"with a daring story, we can't help but remember when The Simpsons was an edgy hip show that would frequently shed a light on cultural complexes\\". They thought it would be ideal if there were more episodes like this one.\\"The Simpsons: 17 Seasons, 17 Episodes L'Osservatore Romano, the daily broadsheet of the Vatican, praised the episode for taking up issues such as Christian faith and religion. Matt Warburton was nominated for a Writers Guild of America Award for Outstanding Writing in Animation at the 58th Writers Guild of America Awards for his script to this episode.

Belanglo State Forest is a planted forest, of mainly pine but some native forestry around the edges, in the Australian state of New South Wales; its total area is about 3,800 hectares. The Belanglo State Forest is located south of Berrima in the Southern Highlands, three kilometres west of the Hume Highway between Sydney and Canberra. The forest is owned by the New South Wales Government and contains some of the earliest pine plantings in the state. The first radiata pines were planted in this area in 1919. The public has free access to the forest; it features two to four wheel drive tracks, creek crossings, and forest camping. It is popular among recreational trail bike riders. History=Murders In 1992 and 1993, seven skeletons were found in the forest, in what was described by media as the backpacker murders and was considered to be the work of a serial killer. Eventually, Ivan Milat, an Australian of Croatian descent was convicted of the murders in 1996 and sentenced to life imprisonment. On 22 November 2010, three teenagers (including one related to Milat) were arrested on suspicion of connection with the discovery of a murdered male in the forest, following a tip-off. David Auchterlonie was celebrating his 17th birthday on 20 November; Mathew Milat, 17, and Cohen Klein, 18 had planned for over a week to lure Auchterlonie to his death. A third person, Chase Day, 18 whose charges were later withdrawn by the DPP went to police midday 21 November to report the murder. = Other deaths = On 29 August 2010, trail bike riders discovered a human skeleton in the forest.

In addition to religious instruction, the collection chronicles a series of events that explain the origins and travels of the Hebrew peoples in the ancient Near East. The historicity of the collection of scriptures is a source of on-going debate. The events of the Hebrew Bible can be subdivided into 3 main sections: the Torah (instruction), the Nevi'im (prophets), and the Ketuvim (writings). The events listed in the Torah start with the creation of the universe and conclude with transfer of authority from Moses to Joshua and the death of Moses. The Nevi'im is authored by leading Hebrew prophets from the time Joshua leads the Hebrew people into Canaan until some time after the return of Hebrew remnant from Babylonian exile. In addition to recorded significant contemporary military and political events, many future events are predicted.

It is constituted by eleven theological colleges from eight denominations. The University of Divinity is the direct successor of the second oldest degree-granting authority in the State of Victoria, the Melbourne College of Divinity. The university's chancery and administration are located in Kew, a suburb of Melbourne in the state of Victoria. The Melbourne College of Divinity was constituted in 1910 by an act of the Parliament of Victoria. The act was amended in 1956, 1972, 1979, 1990, 2005 and 2016 and is now known as the University of Divinity Act 1910 (previously the Melbourne College of Divinity Act 1910).University of Divinity Act 1910, section 35. http://www8.austlii.edu.au/cgi- bin/viewdb/au/legis/vic/consol_act/uoda1910296/ or https://divinity.edu.au/documents/university-act/ From its beginnings the college was a self-accrediting issuer of degrees, while not becoming a university until 2011. Representatives appointed by several churches formed the college to provide tertiary level theological education. The first president was the Right Reverend Henry Lowther Clarke, Anglican Archbishop of Melbourne, and the first registrar was the Reverend John Mathew, Moderator of the Presbyterian Church of Victoria. In 2010, the Melbourne College of Divinity applied to the Victorian Regulation and Qualifications Authority for approval to operate as a self-accrediting \\"Australian University of Specialisation\\" (a category of higher education provider). The Victorian government announced on 30 August 2011 that the application had been approved and on 1 January 2012 the college began operating as a university. Professor Peter Sherlock was appointed the inaugural Vice-Chancellor in April 2012. In May 2019 TEQSA extended the seven year licence to operate as a university for an additional three years to the maximum possible of ten years before a review. In the 2019 Student Experience Survey, the University of Divinity recorded the highest student satisfaction rating out of every Australian university, with an overall satisfaction rating of 92.8. Accreditations and affiliations The University of Divinity offers awards in theology, philosophy, counselling and ministry. In 2001 the institution was listed as a Schedule 1 Higher Education Institution by the Australian Government Department of Education, Science and Training. It receives federal funding for research, Australian Postgraduate Research Awards and International Postgraduate Research Scholarships. The Higher Education Support Act (2003) (HESA 2003) listed the institution as a Table B (Private, Self-regulating) Higher Education Provider, which allowed its students to access federally funded loans under the FEE-HELP scheme.

Established in Levuka on 4 September 1869 by George Littleton Griffiths (1844 Woolwich, England - 1908 Suva, Fiji), it is Fiji's oldest newspaper still operating. The Fiji Times is owned by Motibhai Group of Companies, which purchased it from Rupert Murdoch's News Corp on 22 September 2010. The Fiji Times Limited board is chaired by Kirit Patel (as of 2010), and includes Rajesh Patel, a resident director appointed in 2010 and Jinesh Patel, the marketing manager for the Motibhai Group of Companies. The former publisher Evan Hannah was forcibly removed from Fiji in 2008 as he was accused by the interim government of meddling in Fijian politics. This was prior to the sale by News Corp to the Motibhai Group of Companies. An online edition is published, featuring local news, sport and weather.  Coups and censorship  The Rabuka administration censored the Fiji Times for a while following the first military coup of 14 May 1987. In protest, the newspaper published an edition with large blank spaces, where articles censored by the military would have been placed. The Fiji Times announced on 5 December 2006, in the wake of the overthrow of the civilian government by the military, that it was suspending publication rather than bow to government censorship. Military officers had visited the premises that evening to prohibit the publication of any \\"propaganda\\" in support of the deposed government of Prime Minister Laisenia Qarase. The online edition would be continuing publication as normal, however. Just before midday on 6 December, the military granted permission for the Times to resume publication without censorship. The Times reported on 9 December that two members of the public had been detained and questioned by the Military over letters they had written to the Times editor during the week, and were given a \\"verbal warning.\\" Nonetheless, from December 2006 to April 2009, the Times was able to publish continuously articles critical of the interim government. The latter voiced its displeasure, but did not impose censorship. Following the 2009 Fijian constitutional crisis, however, all Fiji's media were censored, including the Fiji Times. Censors are present in the paper's newsrooms. The newspaper's chief editor Netani Rika told Radio New Zealand International that \\"his journalists continue to cover every story in detail as if they were working in a democratic country without restrictions. And he says they challenge the censors by putting every possible news item before them.\\" The website of the Fiji Times has also been censored since April 2009. Criticism The Fiji Labour Party was once highly critical of the Fiji Times, accusing it of political bias. In July 2008, the party published a report alleging that the Fiji Times had collaborated with others in a deliberate effort to unseat the 1999/2000 Labour-led government.

It is now also a 98 acre (39.8 hectare) biological Site of Special Scientific Interest. It runs in an almost straight line from Woodditton south of Newmarket to Reach north-west of Newmarket. It is also a Special Area of Conservation and a Scheduled Monument. Burwell  Description  Devil's Dyke is over long and is the largest of a series of ancient Cambridgeshire dykes. In some places the bank measures high and across. Its highest point is at Gallows Hill where it measures from the bottom of the ditch to the top of the earth wall. Since the 19th century a railway line and roads have been cut through the dyke, including the combined A14 and A11 roads, and a branch line of the Ipswich to Ely rail line. From Reach, the dyke crosses farmland, before running along the edge of the July Course at Newmarket Racecourse and then through the woods of a private estate near the village of Woodditton.Cambridgeshire Historic Environment Record 07801. The Rowley Mile course is unusual in that it can have races which start in one county, Cambridgeshire, and finish in another, Suffolk. It crosses the Devil's Dyke where it has been previously levelled.  History  View Looking Towards Woodditton (1853) Devil's Dyke is the largest of several earthworks in south Cambridgeshire that were either boundary markers or designed to control movement along the trackways of Ashwell Street and the Icknield Way. When it was created, it completely blocked a narrow land corridor between the southern edge of a region of water-logged marsh (now known as The Fens) in the north-west and dense woodlands in the south, so making circumvention difficult and forming an effective defensive barrier for the lands to the east. The dyke may have served as a way of controlling trade and movement in and out of the area. Findings such as the small quantity of silt in the ditch fills suggest that the dyke fell into disuse soon after it was built. The Devil's Dyke looking towards Woodditton The other Cambridgeshire dykes include Fleam Dyke, Brent Ditch and Bran Ditch. Black Ditches, Cavenham is a fifth earthwork guarding the Icknield Way which is in Suffolk, to the north west of Bury St Edmunds.  The name  The name Devil's Ditch or Dyke is a post-medieval one. In medieval times it was simply called the dic meaning the ditch or le Micheldyche or magnum fossatum which both mean great ditch.  Early commentators  The profiles of the Cambridgeshire dykes, (based on Hartshorne's Salopia Antinqua (1841) The earthwork has been described by various different commentators since Anglo- Saxon times. The Anglo-Saxon Chronicle may refer to the Devil's Dyke in its annal for 905, when Edward the Elder is recorded as fighting and defeating the Danes of East Anglia, after first laying waste to the countryside: 'and he laid waste their land between the Dyke and the Ouse as far northward as the Fens'—' .Earle, Two of the Saxon Chronicles Parallel, pp. lxxi, 98. Abbo of Fleury, writing in the late 10th century, described East Anglia as \\"fortified in the front with a bank or rampier like unto a huge wall, and with a trench or ditch below in the ground\\".Tymms, The Devil's Dyke, Newmarket, p. 175. The mediaeval Flores Historiarum, referred to \\"...duo fossata sancti Eadmundi...\\" – the two fortifications of St Edmund – when describing the battle between Edward and his adversaries.Babington, Ancient Cambridgeshire, p.60.  Modern scholarship  There have been a number of excavations and investigations of the dyke in modern times, including excavations in 1923 and 1991. In 1991, little was found when a small part of the dyke (measuring ) was excavated prior to the construction of a new aqueduct. The results of a 1988 resistivity survey of the point where Street Way cuts through the dyke were inconclusive. The Dyke is thought most likely to be Anglo-Saxon as there would have been no strategic reason to build it in the Roman period, and the most likely context is the period of warfare between Mercia and East Anglia in the sixth and seventh centuries, when the East Anglians might have thrown it up as a line of defence. Ecology  View from the top of Devil's Dyke towards Reach. The site has extensive chalk grassland with diverse species, and areas of woodland and chalk scrub. There are unusual plants such as purple milk-vetch, bastard toadflax and pasque flowers.

Amongst Murray's other honours, he was named an All-Australian player in 1958 and 1966. His 333 games for Fitzroy was a then VFL record, but 208 of these games resulted in losses, the most ever suffered by a single player in the VFL/AFL, and played 44 games for East Perth. His total of 377 games was an elite football record until 1979, when it was broken by Barry Cable. He also played 24 matches for Victoria and six for Western Australia in interstate football. From 1975 until 1976, Murray served as captain-coach of the Sandringham Football Club in the Victorian Football Association. At the end of the 1996 season, Fitzroy merged with the Brisbane Bears to form the Brisbane Lions. Murray was a great supporter of the new entity, and the Lions' club championship award, the Merrett–Murray Medal, is part-named in Murray's honour.

She was a Country Liberal Party member of the Northern Territory Legislative Assembly from September 2001 to September 2010, representing the Alice Springs-based electorate of Araluen. She was the Shadow Attorney-General, and Shadow Minister for Justice, Health, Family and Community Services, Business and Industry, Women's Policy, Territory Development, the AustralAsia Railway, Police, Fire and Emergency Services, Central Australia and Defence Support. Until 29 January 2008 she was also the Opposition Leader. Carney announced her resignation from parliament on 19 August 2010, effective 3 September. She cited health reasons as the primary cause of her resignation. Biography=Early life Carney was born in Melbourne, Victoria, and studied at Bendigo High School before commencing a law degree at the University of Melbourne. She graduated in 1989, and moved to Alice Springs the following year in order to do her articles. In 1990, she was admitted to legal practice, and worked as a solicitor for the next seven years. In 1997, she opened her own local practice, which she operated until deciding to contest pre-selection for the Legislative Assembly seat of Araluen at the 2001 election. Carney is openly lesbian, and has been in a same-sex relationship for over twenty years. Career Carney's bid for the pre-selection gained some media attention, as she was a reasonably high-profile candidate, but she was ultimately overlooked by the Alice Springs branch, who instead chose Peter Harvey. However, John Elferink, a sitting MP who had lost his preselection for MacDonnell, complained to the party's Central Council, making claims of branch-stacking. The fallout from the letter was immense—on 25 November 2000, in what was dubbed by the local media as \\"The Night of the Long Knives\\", all the preselections of the Alice Springs branch were overturned. The Central Council preselected Carney for Araluen, reinstated Elferink's preselection for MacDonnell, and pushed aside sitting minister Loraine Braham in Braitling in favour of Harvey. The controversial and largely unprecedented decision from head office earned Carney many enemies in the local branch of the party. It was generally believed at the time that the Central Council's decision to preselect Carney for Araluen all but assured her a seat in parliament. Historically, Araluen had been a reasonably safe seat for the Country Liberal Party, and Labor had never come close to winning it. Longtime CLP MP Eric Poole held the seat with a seemingly insurmountable majority of 19.2 percent. However, Carney faced a significant challenge not only from Labor, but two well-known independents. The CLP lost over 27 percent of its primary vote from 1997, but Carney ultimately won by 134 votes. In opposition, Carney took responsibility for several portfolios, including tourism, correctional services and communications. While she often acted as a conservative voice in the assembly on many issues, advocating a particularly hard line on issues of law and order (including mandatory sentencing) and drug policy, this was not always the case, as she also clashed with her own party on several issues—most notably in 2003, when she crossed the floor to vote with the ALP in supporting legislation decreasing the age of consent for gay males. In mid-2003, Deputy Opposition Leader Mike Reed resigned, and Carney was widely tipped as the favourite to succeed him. However, in a surprise result—widely put down to both her poor relationship with the influential Alice Springs branch and her support, against their wishes, for Denis Burke's leadership, she was defeated by Dr. Richard Lim. However, she soon changed sides and decided to support Terry Mills after Burke refused to allow a conscience vote on the age of consent legislation. She was subsequently promoted, being made Shadow Attorney-General and Shadow Minister for Justice, and then again in late 2004, being made Shadow Minister for Health. Carney faced her first re-election bid at the 2005 election. While commentators were generally divided on whether she would hold her seat, as it was the CLP's most marginal, almost no one expected the final result. On election day, there were massive and unprecedented swings to Labor in every seat in the Territory—except Araluen. While Burke, who had not long before regained the leadership, lost his seat of Brennan, which was the safest CLP seat in the Territory, Carney easily held her seat with a swing in her favour in the vicinity of five percent, proving to be in the least danger of the CLP's elected members. Araluen was the only seat that saw a swing to the CLP, which was cut down to only four seats. Burke had already announced that he would stand down as leader if he lost the election. The loss of his own seat made this promise moot, and speculation turned to who would lead what remained of the CLP. Mills was unlikely to take up the leadership again after having resigned as leader not long before on the grounds that he had been ineffective, and potential aspirants John Elferink and Sue Carter had also been swept out in the Labor landslide. Carney emerged as the leading candidate in the CLP's much-reduced party room, and was elected as Burke's replacement with Mills as her deputy. Though she had not been Opposition Leader for long, Carney oversaw a change in Country Liberal Party policy, shifting it notably to the left—such as attacking the government's law and order policies from a humanitarian, rather than hardline perspective—a position more traditionally aligned with the Labor government. She adopted a somewhat more congenial attitude towards Chief Minister Clare Martin than Mills and Burke had taken, and tended to be more subtle in her means of attacking Martin. On 29 January 2008, Mills asked Carney if she was willing to swap posts with him, with Mills becoming leader and Carney becoming deputy leader. Carney refused, instead calling a leadership spill. The vote was tied at two votes apiece. Under CLP rules, Carney could have theoretically remained leader. However, Carney announced that a tie was not a vote of confidence and resigned, echoing Prime Minister John Gorton's move in 1971. This left Mills to take the leadership unopposed on a second vote. Carney announced her resignation from parliament on 19 August 2010, effective 3 September. She cited health reasons as the primary cause of her resignation. The CLP's refusal to disendorse Leo Abbott, who had been charged with domestic violence, as their candidate for the Federal seat of Lingiari was also a reason for her resigning, Robyn Lambley, a former deputy mayor of Alice Springs, was elected in her place in a by-election. Terry Mills went on to become Chief Minister by winning the 2012 election. Carney is the earliest CLP leader who did not head a Northern Territory government. Carney resigned from the CLP in June 2015, citing dissatisfaction with Chief Minister Adam Giles.Oaten, James; La Canna, Xavier.

History  Although the origin of the name Nightcliff has always been surrounded by conjecture and controversy, the naming can be tracked back to 8 September 1839. Early that day, , which was engaged on an excursion of the Australian coast, sailed into the area and anchored in Shoal Bay near Hope Inlet. John Lort Stokes, William Forsyth and several other crew members left Beagle on a longboat for an excursion and passed around Lee Point, in the vicinity of which, there appeared to be a major opening. Stokes was later to record. > \\"The sea breeze setting in early, we did not reach it till after dark, when > we landed for observations at a cliffy projection near the eastern entrance > point: this we found to be composed of a kind of clay, mixed with calcareous > matter. We had some difficulty in landing, and then in scrambling up the > cliffs by the light of a lantern. If any of the watchful natives happened at > the time to be on the look out, they must have stood in astonishment at > beholding such strange persons, who at such a time of night, with no > ostensible object were visiting their shores\\".Stokes, John. (1846). > Discoveries in Australia, with an account of the coasts and rivers explored > and surveyed during the voyage of the Beagle, 1837–1843. Volume 2. Accessed > online (1 September 2007). The term 'Night Cliff' was thus applied to the locality, and it subsequently appeared in this form on Surveyor-General George W. Goyder's original plan of 1869. Goyder also mentioned the locality a couple of times in the diary he kept as leader of the Northern Territory Survey Expedition. Despite these well established facts, many people have insisted that the name was derived from a misspelling of the name of John George Knight, one of the best known government officials in Darwin for nearly two decades prior to his death in 1892. It was known that Knight enjoyed visiting the Nightcliff environs and it is believed that he spent long periods of contemplation on the cliff tops. As late as 1952, a former resident who had lived in Darwin between 1876 and 1926 wrote to the Northern Territory News insisting that the area was known during that period as \\"Knightscliff\\". It is evident that many Territorians have preferred this variant form of name in deference to one of the most highly distinguished local public figures of the late nineteenth century. However, records show that Knight did not arrive in Darwin until 1873, several years after the publication of Goyder's map. The Nightcliff foreshore was the site of Royal Australian Air Force camps with spotlights and large guns used to defend Darwin from bombing during the Second World War. During 1941, a naval outpost including a large concrete artillery outpost bunker was established on the headland. Various other defence facilities were constructed inland as large numbers of military personnel moved into the area. The 2/14 Field Regiment A.I.F. (Australian Infantry Force) was given the task of planning and constructing a hutted camp which became known as \\"Night Cliff's Camp\\". After the war, increasing pressure for suburban development caused the Nomenclature Committee of the N.T. to officially name the area on 29 October 1948. The conjoint version of the name, \\"Nightcliff\\" was adopted.Barter, Leith. (1994). From wartime camp to garden suburb: a short history of Nightcliff and Rapid Creek.

Along the footpath there is Nightcliff Jetty, Nightcliff Beach and Nightcliff Swimming Pool. On Sundays, the Nightcliff Markets occur from 6am to 2pm. The stalls at the markets are mainly food and drinks but there is also craft and massage stalls. A live music band usually plays music on the stage in the middle of the markets. Nightcliff Coastal Erosion The Nightcliff area is generally associated with its sister suburb, Rapid Creek, and the adjacent northern suburbs of Millner and Coconut Grove. Nightcliff has arguably become one of Darwin's most popular suburbs, as it is mostly situated directly on the coastal fringe. A lot of development has been completed on the coastal road, Casuarina Drive. Several well-known and long-established sports clubs are associated with the Nightcliff regional area, including the Nightcliff Football Club and the Nightcliff Baseball Club. Close to the foreshore is Nightcliff Primary School, one of Darwin's oldest schools. Nightcliff Middle School provides education for student in years 7 to Year 9.  Coastal erosion  The eponymous cliffs of Nightcliff are being actively eroded and around or more of cliff loss has been recorded in the 2014–2016 period. Areas of Nightcliff have been shored up using concrete boulders to form a sea wall.

It originally aired on the Fox network in the United States on February 6, 2000. In the episode, the Simpson family rescues a diving horse named Duncan from the abuse of his owner and keeps him as a pet. When the cost of keeping Duncan rises, Homer and Bart train him to be a racehorse. Duncan wins several races and, as a result, Homer is threatened with death by a group of jockeys. Meanwhile, Lisa is upset over her school unfairly losing the musical band competition at a state fair and writes a letter to U.S. President Bill Clinton in protest. The episode features several guest appearances; horse race caller Trevor Denman stars as himself, commentating the races in the episode, and voice artist Jim Cummings provides the animal sounds made by Duncan. Randy Bachman and Fred Turner appear as themselves as their rock band Bachman–Turner Overdrive performs at the state fair. \\"Saddlesore Galactica\\" was written by Tim Long and directed by Lance Kramer. A number of meta-references are included in the episode, such as the character Comic Book Guy telling the Simpsons that they have owned a horse before in the episode \\"Lisa's Pony\\". Around 9.6 million American homes tuned in to watch the episode during its original airing. In 2008, it was released on DVD, along with the rest of the episodes of the eleventh season. \\"Saddlesore Galactica\\" is despised by many television critics and fans according to Long. It has been described by About.com's Nancy Basile as one of the season's worst episodes, by Marco Ursi of Maclean's as the worst episode of the series, and has frequently been cited by fans as an example of the show jumping the shark. Criticism has been directed at its outlandish plot, which, among other things, features elf-like jockeys who lure Homer into their secret lair where they threaten him to stop Duncan from winning. Plot Lisa and the other members of Springfield Elementary's school band enter a music competition together at a state fair, performing James Brown's \\"Living in America\\". However, they lose to the Ogdenville Elementary band, which performs John Philip Sousa's \\"Stars and Stripes Forever\\" and uses red, white, and blue glowsticks to form a flag. Lisa accuses Ogdenville of cheating as the use of visual aids is against the rules of the competition. She later writes a letter to President Clinton, complaining about the situation. At the fair, Homer and Bart see a horse named Duncan that can dive into pools. The Simpsons take Duncan home after his sleazy owner is accused of animal cruelty and flees. However, they find themselves spending $500 a week for Duncan's upkeep. Homer and Bart try to think of a way that Duncan can make money to help offset the costs of keeping him. Bart discovers that Duncan is a fast runner and suggests that he should be a racehorse. Homer enters Duncan at the Springfield Downs race track, with Bart as the jockey. However, a frightened Duncan loses his first race as he refuses to leave the stall until all other horses have finished. Homer and Bart find a strategy for Duncan to win by turning him into a frightening horse named \\"Furious D\\", complete with dyed hair and one of Lisa's bracelets for a nose ring. He intimidates the other horses and wins several races. Homer is soon invited by the losing jockeys to have a beer in their lounge, which turns out to be a secret lair. The jockeys reveal themselves to be crazy, arrogant elf-based creatures and threaten to eat Homer's brain unless he makes Duncan lose the upcoming Springfield Derby. Though frightened at first, Homer changes his mind due to his loyalty to his son and his horse as well as his own pride, vowing to deal with those \\"murderous trolls\\". Duncan wins the Derby, sending the jockeys into a rage, and they begin chasing after Homer and Bart with swords. However, Marge and Lisa spray the jockeys with water to subdue them, and Homer stuffs them all into a garbage bag and leaves them at the curb to be hauled away with the garbage. Homer and Bart prepare to retire Duncan from racing so he can become a stud. President Clinton then shows up at the Simpsons's house and presents Lisa with a plaque, overruling the state fair judges and declaring Springfield Elementary as the winner of the music competition. Production Randy Bachman guest starred in the episode as himself, appearing as part of Bachman–Turner Overdrive despite having left the band at that time. \\"Saddlesore Galactica\\" was written by Tim Long and directed by Lance Kramer as part of the eleventh season of The Simpsons (1999–2000). The title is a reference to the science fiction television series Battlestar Galactica. The idea of Duncan originally being a diving horse was inspired by an actual diving horse that used to jump into a pool at Steel Pier in Atlantic City, New Jersey at the beginning of the 20th century;Meyer, George (2008).

Audio commentary for \\"Saddlesore Galactica\\", in The Simpsons: The Complete Eleventh Season [DVD]. 20th Century Fox. When the animation process began, Kramer drew instructions to his animators on how horses move when they run and how their ankles work. He has said that because Duncan was a large part of the story, \\"we wanted him to have somewhat of a personality. So when everybody knew how to draw the horse and we got that out of the way, they could animate the horse acting.\\" Voice artist Jim Cummings provided the animal sounds made by Duncan in the episode. American horse race caller Trevor Denman guest starred in the episode as himself, commentating on Duncan's races over the public-address system. Randy Bachman and Fred Turner, known for their rock band Bachman–Turner Overdrive, made an appearance in the episode as themselves. They perform on stage at the state fair during the beginning of the episode. When Bachman and Turner tell the audience that they are going to play some songs from their new album, Homer immediately yells out demands for them to play their old song \\"Takin' Care of Business\\". The band starts the song and Homer then yells, \\"Get to the 'workin overtime' part!\\" The band obliges, skipping straight to the chorus. Bachman had left the band when \\"Saddlesore Galactica\\" was recorded and because of tension between him and Turner, the two recorded their lines separately on different occasions.Scully, Mike (2008). Audio commentary for \\"Saddlesore Galactica\\", in The Simpsons: The Complete Eleventh Season [DVD]. 20th Century Fox. Long has said that the Simpsons staff members \\"were thrilled to have [them] on the show\\" and that the pair \\"could not have been nicer.\\" Meta-references The episode is heavily self-referential and contains a number of meta-references. When the Simpsons take Duncan home from the fair, Comic Book Guy points out to the Simpsons that they have already taken in a horse as a pet (as seen in \\"Lisa's Pony\\"), and that \\"the expense forced Homer to work at the Kwik-E-Mart, with hilarious consequences.\\" In another scene later in the episode, when Lisa points out to Marge that Marge is showing signs of gambling problems, Comic Book Guy shows up again wearing a T-shirt that says \\"Worst Episode Ever\\" and tells Lisa: \\"Hey, I'm watching you!\\" This refers to the fact that Marge's gambling problems have already been explored in the episode \\"$pringfield\\". Jonathan Gray analyzed the self-referentiality in The Simpsons in his 2006 book Watching with The Simpsons: Television, Parody, and Intertextuality, writing that \\"Sitcoms constantly 'reset' themselves, living in [...] an 'existential circle' in which nothing really changes, and every episode starts more or less where the last one started; and The Simpsons frequently plays with this sitcom clock, and with the amnesia of sitcom memory. The family members often forget important events in their 'history' [...]\\". Gray noted that in \\"Saddlesore Galactica\\", \\"the action continues as normal, as sitcom memory (or lack thereof) is pointed out but comically not acted upon. Thus, where David Grote [author of The End of Comedy: The Sit-Com and the Comedic Tradition] (1983: 67) notes that sitcom episodes 'live in a kind of time-warp without any reference to the other episodes,' producing a situation whereby everything 'remains inviolate and undisturbed, no matter what transitory events may occur' (1983: 59), The Simpsons comically reflects upon this.\\" Reception The episode originally aired on the Fox network in the United States on February 6, 2000. It was viewed in approximately 9.6 million households that night. With a Nielsen rating of 9.5, \\"Saddlesore Galactica\\" finished 29th in the ratings for the week of January 31–February 6, 2000. It was the second highest-rated broadcast on Fox that week, following an episode of Malcolm in the Middle. On October 7, 2008, \\"Saddlesore Galactica\\" was released on DVD as part of the box set The Simpsons – The Complete Eleventh Season. Staff members Tim Long, Lance Kramer, Mike Scully, Matt Groening, George Meyer, Ian Maxtone- Graham, Matt Selman, and Tom Martin participated in the DVD audio commentary for the episode. Deleted scenes from the episode were also included on the box set. According to Long, \\"Saddlesore Galactica\\" is considered by many critics and fans as one of the worst episodes in the history of the show, particularly for the scenes featuring the jockey elves.Long, Tim. (2008). Audio commentary for \\"Saddlesore Galactica\\", in The Simpsons: The Complete Eleventh Season [DVD]. 20th Century Fox. In 2007, Maclean's writer Marco Ursi named it his least favorite episode of The Simpsons, elaborating: \\"This is the one where the Simpsons get a horse – again – and the plot devolves into something involving the secret land of the jockeys. Making meta-references to the fact you’ve just made your 'worst episode ever' doesn’t make it any funnier.\\" Nancy Basile of About.com listed the episode as one of the worst episodes of the season—one of the episodes that made her \\"cringe because they included blatant gimmicks and outlandish plots\\". Despite its criticisms, \\"Saddlesore Galactica\\" received some positive reviews. While reviewing the eleventh season of The Simpsons, DVD Movie Guide's Colin Jacobson commented on the episode, writing: \\"I remember that 'Saddlesore' was much despised when it first aired, though I can’t recall if I joined that chorus as well. Maybe the many iffy episodes since early 2000 have made it look better, but I think that 'Saddlesore' offers a decent number of laughs. It goes off onto some dopey tangents and displays an unnerving tendency toward self-awareness, but it provides reasonable entertainment.\\" DVD Talk's Ian Jane described the cameo appearance by Bachman and Turner as \\"fun\\".

In total he wrote sixteen monologues for Stanley Holloway, whilst Holloway himself wrote only five. Family background Edgar's Great grandfather was James Henry Marriott. His parents were Jane (also known as Jenny) née Taylor, born in London in 1856, and Richard Horatio Marriott Edgar (1847–1894), only son of Alice Marriott (1824–1900), proprietress of the Marriott family theatre troupe. Richard was born in Manchester, Lancashire, near Christmas 1847 as Richard Horatio Marriott; both his two sisters, Adeline Marriott (b. 1853) and Grace Marriott (b. 1858) were also born in Lancashire. Later all three children chose to take the surname of their mother's husband, Robert Edgar, whom she married in 1856.FreeBMD marriage record, June 1856 Richard and Jane married in March 1875, with Richard being unaware that he had fathered an illegitimate namesake son, Richard Horatio Edgar Wallace, with widowed actress Mrs Mary Jane \\"Polly\\" Richards, after a brief sexual encounter. Polly, having invented an obligation in London to hide her pregnancy, gave birth in secret on 1 April 1875, almost a month after Richard and Jenny married. This son became the famous journalist, novelist, playwright and screenplay writer Edgar Wallace. Richard and Jenny Taylor's children were Alice Marriott Edgar (b. 1876, London), twins Richard and Jennifer Marriott Edgar (b. 1878, London), after whose births the family moved to Scotland, where George was born, then returning to London, where Joseph Marriott Edgar was born in 1884 and Adeline Alice Edgar in 1886.

Monologues the Tower Holloway was already enjoying some success with the monologue format, with such classics as Sam, Pick Oop Tha' Musket. Edgar asked him if he had heard a story about a couple who had taken their son to the zoo, only to see the lad eaten by a lion. Holloway had indeed heard the story, and shortly afterwards Edgar supplied him with a script. The Lion and Albert became one of Holloway's most popular pieces, one of many he recorded beginning in 1930. The lion of the poem is named \\"Wallace\\", which was the name of the first African lion to be bred in Britain, living from 1812 until 1838, and his name became a popular one for lions.Wallace the lion at ravishingbeasts.com Edgar gave the poem the title The Lion and Albert, but some later performances and re-publications used the form Albert and the Lion.The Lion and Albert A pub on Blackpool Promenade also uses the latter form. The monologues were designed to be spoken rhythmically with piano accompaniment, which in many cases was also composed by Edgar.for examples see The texts were published by Francis, Day & Hunter during the 1930s in three collections.

It was originally a traveling theater ensemble with many members, most notably Ulf Dageby, Anders Melander, Totta Näslund, Nikke Ström, Hans Mosesson and Pale Olofsson. History Initially formed as a free theater group in Lund in 1968, Nationalteatern moved to Gothenburg and started to put heavy emphasis on the musical part of the plays. The leader of the group in the early days was Anders Melander, who also played most of the instruments on the group's debut album, Ta det som ett löfte...ta det inte som ett hot (Take it as a promise...don’t take it as a threat). On the second album, Livet är en fest (Life is a party), Ulf Dageby was allowed more creative room, and he later evolved into the group's driving force. The album was a more straightforward rock album than the previous one, a formula that proved very successful. In 1977, many members of Nationalteatern played a significant part in The Tent Project. The next year saw the release of Barn av vår tid (Children of our time) – the first album featuring Totta Näslund – and still later Rövarkungens ö (The Island of the Bandit King). After 1980, the group moved away from the theatrical work and concentrated on music, calling themselves a rock orchestra. The group dissolved soon afterward, but the new millennium has seen several reunions of Nationalteatern, touring all over Sweden, even after Totta Näslund died in 2005. No new songs or albums have yet been recorded. In 2002 a tribute album, Nationalsånger - Hymner från Vågen och EPAs torg, was released, featuring several of Sweden's most famous musicians (such as Backyard Babies, The Hellacopters, The Soundtrack of Our Lives, Lisa Miskovsky, and The Ark) performing Nationalteatern songs. Their music, which was composed to the plays the group wrote and performed at youth community centers in Sweden, was written in a youth-in-trouble-theme, often containing an anti-drug message.

The Graeco-Armeno-Aryan group supposedly branched off from the parent Indo-European stem by the mid-3rd millennium BC. Relation to the possible homeland In the context of the Kurgan hypothesis, Graeco-Aryan is also known as \\"Late Proto-Indo-European\\" or \\"Late Indo-European\\" to suggest that Graeco-Aryan forms a dialect group, which corresponds to the latest stage of linguistic unity in the Indo-European homeland in the early part of the 3rd millennium BC. By 2500 BC, Proto-Greek and Proto-Indo-Iranian had separated, moving westward and eastward from the Pontic Steppe, respectively.Martin Litchfield West, Indo-European poetry and myth (2007), p. 7. If Graeco-Aryan is a valid group, Grassmann's law may have a common origin in Greek and Sanskrit. However, Grassmann's law in Greek postdates certain sound changes that happened only in Greek and not Sanskrit, which suggests that it could not have been inherited directly from a common Graeco-Aryan stage. Rather, it is more likely that an areal feature spread across a then-contiguous Graeco- Aryan–speaking area. That would have occurred after early stages of Proto- Greek and Proto-Indo-Iranian had developed into separate dialects but before they ceased to be in geographic contact. Scientific discussion Evidence for the existence of a Graeco-Aryan subclade was given by Wolfram Euler's 1979 examination on shared features in Greek and Sanskrit nominal inflection.Wolfram Euler: Indoiranisch-griechische Gemeinsamkeiten der Nominalbildung und deren indogermanische Grundlagen [= Aryan-Greek Communities in Nominal Morphology and their Indoeuropean Origins].

Graeco-Aryan is invoked in particular in studies of comparative mythology such as Martin Litchfield West (1999) and Calvert Watkins (2001).Calvert Watkins (2001), How to Kill a Dragon, Oxford University Press, . A widely rejected hypothesis has placed Greek in a Graeco-Armenian subclade of Indo-European, though some researchers have integrated both attempts by including also Armenian in a putative Graeco-Armeno-Aryan language family, further divided between Proto-Greek (possibly united with Phrygian) and thus arriving at an Armeno-Aryan subclade, the putative ancestor of Armenian and Indo-Iranian.Handbook of Formal Languages (1997), p. 6.Indo-European tree with Armeno-Aryan, separate from Greek Graeco-Aryan has comparatively wide support among Indo-Europeanists who support the Armenian hypothesis, which asserts that the homeland of the Indo-European language family was in the Armenian Highlands.Renfrew, A.

A commercial for \\"Alone Again, Natura-Diddily\\" that aired before the episode was broadcast was criticized by many viewers because it appeared the episode would be parodying an incident at Lowe's Motor Speedway in Charlotte, North Carolina that left three spectators dead. Then- Fox affiliate WCCB in Charlotte, North Carolina refused to show the commercial, but after viewing the episode they came to the conclusion that it was not making fun of the incident. Reviews of \\"Alone Again, Natura-Diddily\\" from television critics have been mixed. Plot On a trip to the bird sanctuary, the Simpson family discovers that an oval racing track built around the sanctuary is opening that day, to Lisa's dismay. The family watches the stock car race from the stand and sees Ned Flanders and his family, who claims to enjoy the high levels of safety the drivers use. Later, a squad of cheerleaders fires free T-shirts from air cannons into the crowd, and Homer rudely demands one. Irritated, Maude leaves to buy hot dogs. The cheerleaders send a full salvo of T-shirts in Homer's direction, but at the last second he spots a bobby pin and bends over to pick it up, just as Maude returns. The T-shirts hit Maude and she falls over the bleachers to the ground, where Dr. Hibbert declares her dead. Everyone offers their condolences to a devastated Ned, and Bart reluctantly plays a Christian video game with Rod and Todd. Homer accompanies Ned back home after the funeral and talks with him later that night when Ned is unable to sleep due to his loneliness and concern over having to raise his sons alone. Feeling bad for his part in Maude's death, Homer secretly makes a videotape of Ned to show to single women across Springfield in order to help him get on with his life. Ned gets to date several women thanks to the tape, including Lindsey Naegle and Edna Krabappel, but none of them are successful. On a Saturday night, Ned prays to God, but becomes angry when he feels he is not getting any response. The next morning, Ned is still angry and tells his sons he will not be going to church, scaring them. Guilt-ridden, he later rushes to church and upon entering, sees a Christian rock band, Kovenant, performing. He is attracted to the singer, Rachel Jordan, who sings about not losing faith in God because He is always there for people. Inspired by the song, Ned later assists Rachel in loading some equipment onto her truck and confides in her of his loss, with which she sympathizes. He and Rachel become acquainted, but she has to leave for the next stop on the band's tour, promising to come back and meet up with him afterward. Production Maggie Roswell, the original voice of Maude. \\"Alone Again, Natura-Diddily\\" was written by Ian Maxtone-Graham and directed by Jim Reardon as part of the eleventh season of the show (1999–2000). When the writing staff conceived the idea for the speedway parts, they were thinking that it would be a great opportunity for them to get several NASCAR drivers to make guest appearances in the episode. However, according to Scully, they could not get a single one because \\"they were all concerned about the way we were portraying NASCAR\\".Scully, Mike. (2008). Commentary for \\"Alone Again, Natura-Diddily\\", in The Simpsons: The Complete Eleventh Season [DVD]. 20th Century Fox. Speedway racing is depicted in a negative light in the episode, with an overemphasis on crashes. The episode features the death of the character Maude Flanders, who had previously been voiced by cast member Maggie Roswell. This kill-off was the result of Roswell leaving The Simpsons in spring 1999 after a pay dispute with the Fox Broadcasting Company, which airs the show. Since 1994, she had been flying between her Denver home and Los Angeles twice a week to record episodes of The Simpsons. She eventually grew tired of this, and the price of plane tickets was constantly increasing. As a result, she asked Fox for a pay raise from $2,000 per episode to $6,000 per episode. However, Fox only offered her a $150 raise, which did not cover the travel costs, so she decided to quit. Voice actress Marcia Mitzman Gaven was hired to fill in for Roswell's characters, including Maude in this episode and the earlier episodes of the eleventh season, although the producers decided to kill her off to open up new storylines for the show. Executive producer Mike Scully said it \\"was a chance for one of our regular characters [Ned Flanders] to face a challenge and grow in a new direction. The idea came up quickly, we all latched on to it, and it just felt right. We didn't want to kill a character for the sake of killing. We wanted it to have consequences for surviving characters to deal with in future episodes.\\" Roswell returned to The Simpsons in 2002 after reaching a deal with Fox to record her lines from her home in Denver. Since returning, she has voiced Maude in flashbacks and as a ghost. When asked by The Denver Post on how she thought Ned was doing without Maude, she replied: \\"OK. But Maude was such a vulnerable character. Maude and Lisa and Marge were the only vulnerable characters, really, everybody else has an edge. So they [the staff] discovered that arc was lost, and now there are a lot of flashbacks with Maude.\\" Scully has noted that \\"there was a lot of discussion about making sure we [the staff] did deal with some of the emotional ramifications of death [in the episode] and not just make it all joke, joke, joke. But at the same time, we're a comedy, they're animated, they're not real.\\" In one of the first scripts for the episode there was a scene in which Rod and Todd discuss their mother's death. However, according to Maxtone-Graham, the writing staff decided to cut it because \\"it just never played anything but sad.\\" He added that the writers \\"really wanted to address how [the children] would feel\\" but they \\"could never pull it off without it just being sad.\\"Maxtone-Graham, Ian. (2008). Commentary for \\"Alone Again, Natura-Diddily\\", in The Simpsons: The Complete Eleventh Season [DVD]. 20th Century Fox. Scully has commented that it was a \\"very sweet scene\\" but it was too difficult to \\"get out of it comedically to the next scene.\\" Shawn Colvin voices Rachel Jordan American musician Shawn Colvin guest starred in the episode as Rachel Jordan, a character that she would later return to voice in the episode \\"I'm Goin' to Praiseland\\" (2001) from season twelve. In that episode, she stays at the Flanders' house with Ned, and leaves briefly after he attempted to mold her in the image of his deceased wife. At the end of the episode, however, she returns and has a date with him. Colvin told the Seattle Post-Intelligencer that being raised in Carbondale, Illinois meant she did not have to do much research for the guest appearance: \\"It's just very isolated [in Carbondale]. There was church music and that was about it. [...] I didn't have to dig too deep for the role. I suppose the whole 'Simpsons' thing is kind of like a hick town.\\" Colvin has shown a segment of her guest role on The Simpsons during some of her concerts, including one at Cape Cod Melody Tent in 2007. She has also performed the song that she sings in \\"Alone Again, Natura- Diddily\\" in concert. The Wisconsin State Journal reported that during her 2001 concert at Barrymore Theatre, the \\"loudest audience response came after she sang a ditty that she performed as a character on The Simpsons.\\" The song, called \\"He's the Man\\", later appeared on the 2007 soundtrack album The Simpsons: Testify. Broadcast and ratings According to executive producer Mike Scully, one of the reasons for killing off Maude was to increase ratings. The episode originally aired on the Fox network in the United States on February 13, 2000. It tied Dateline NBC for the 17th place (compared the season average of 37) in the ratings for the week of February 7–13, 2000, with a Nielsen rating of 10.7. The episode was the highest-rated show on Fox that week, and was viewed in approximately 10.8 million households. Scully has admitted that another reason for killing off Maude was to increase ratings for The Simpsons during the February sweeps.Close-up of the episode in a February 2000 issue of TV Guide. To bring in even more viewers for the broadcast, the Simpsons producers chose not to reveal beforehand who the character that would be killed off was to create speculation. Fox also decided not to send out screener tapes to television critics to keep it a secret. However, according to an article in the Contra Costa Times that was published on the day the episode aired, \\"all the advance rumors suggest that Ned Flanders' wife, Maude, should watch her back.\\" The revelation of the episode's title, \\"Alone Again, Natura-Diddly\\", was one of the reasons that the media and many people suspected Maude. As The Post-Standards William LaRue writes, \\"diddly\\" is the \\"familiar greeting of Maude's husband, Ned Flanders.\\" Roswell's announced departure strengthened this suspicion. Reception The episode has received mixed reviews from television critics. Gregory Hardy of the Orlando Sentinel placed it at number eleven on his list of the show's fifteen best episodes that target the world of sports. Writing for IGN, Robert Canning gave the episode a 7 out of 10 rating, commenting that he thought the three acts felt disconnected. He wrote: \\"First Maude dies, then Ned dates and now Ned questions his faith. To me, these three storylines would have been better served had they been the focus of their own individual episodes.\\" Canning added that he felt \\"the episode made a poor choice by rushing through the mourning period and moving right into Ned dating,\\" but that \\"the dating stuff, while, again, feeling hurried, was quite funny, especially Ned's date with Edna Krabappel.\\" DVD Movie Guide's Colin Jacobson commented on the episode in a negative way, writing that it was \\"a harsh and cynical move [to kill off Maude because of Roswell's departure], though I could forgive the decision if it produced a more satisfying episode. Perhaps the writers made this one super-sincere to counteract the inherent cynicism behind its origins, but the show just seems sappy and lame.\\" Winnipeg Free Press columnist Randall King wrote in his review of the eleventh season of The Simpsons that there is \\"something undeniably funny about having Maude Flanders die by a barrage of T-shirts fired by air cannons at a speedway. But the episode Alone Again Natura-Diddily was proof that the dependably brilliant series could – and did – go seriously wrong when it turned 11. Killing off Maude was a sin [...]\\". Controversy Before \\"Alone Again, Natura-Diddily\\" was broadcast, a promotional commercial aired on television that featured, among other things, the announcement that \\"one of Springfield's most beloved will die\\" and a snippet of a scene from the episode with the character Lenny, sitting in the speedway spectator stand, being hit by a car tire, giving the impression that he would be the one who would die. Many viewers of the commercial, including Speedway Motorsports, Inc. owned Lowe's Motor Speedway president and public address announcer Jerry Gappens, expressed their concern as it appeared the episode was parodying an actual incident that happened during a speedway race at Lowe's Motor Speedway in May 1999, in Charlotte, North Carolina, when flying debris in a crash killed three spectators. Gappens said that doing a parody of that was \\"a real insensitive thing to do, pretty irresponsible. Obviously what might appear funny in L.A. or New York isn't funny here in Charlotte.\\" Lowe's Motor Speedway announced to WSOC-TV's Channel 9 Eyewitness News on February 7, 2000 that they were thinking of placing a complaint to the Fox Broadcasting Company. WCCB, the then-Fox affiliate in Charlotte, refused to continue showing the commercial for the episode. As a result, Fox distributed a new commercial to the affiliate on February 9 that did not contain the scene with Lenny. Antonia Coffman, a spokeswoman for The Simpsons, told The Charlotte Observer that \\"the Lowe's incident didn't inspire the scene\\" and that the episode was not meant to offend anyone. After WCCB had gotten the opportunity to actually see the episode they decided that they would air it, realizing that the original commercial was misleading and that they did not think the episode was making fun of the incident. In the episode, the viewers can see that Lenny tries to get the attention of the cheerleaders by raising his hand so that they aim a T-shirt with the cannon at him. However, he is hit by a car tire instead. Unlike what the commercial implied, Lenny is not killed and is soon back in his seat. WCCB told the Associated Press that their interpretation of the scene was that someone threw the tire to Lenny because he was raising his hand, and that the tire did not actually come from a car crash on the track. Despite this, the affiliate announced that they would start the broadcast of the episode with a message warning viewers of the scene anyway.

Boyd family artistic dynasty The Boyd artistic dynasty began with the marriage of Emma Minnie à Beckett (known as Minnie) and Arthur Merric Boyd in 1886. Both were already established as painters at the time of their marriage. Their second-born son Merric Boyd married Doris Gough and had five artistic children, Lucy de Guzman Boyd, Arthur Boyd, Guy Boyd, David Boyd, and Mary Elizabeth Boyd. In 1948 David Boyd married Hermia Lloyd-Jones, the daughter of graphic artist Herman and Erica Lloyd-Jones. Following the tradition of their family, their three daughters Amanda, Lucinda, and Cassandra are artists. Education and career Boyd entered the Melba Memorial Conservatorium of Music in Melbourne at seventeen, but was conscripted to the army after one year. Upon his return, he studied art at the National Gallery School on an ex-serviceman's grant. In 1946, he worked with his brother Guy at the Martin Boyd Pottery in Sydney. He also established a pottery studio in London in the early 1950s and continued working mainly in pottery through to the mid-1960s. In 1956, Boyd and his wife became widely known as leading Australian potters. They introduced new glazing techniques and potter's wheel use in shaping sculptural figures. Boyd's painting career began in 1957 with a series of symbolic paintings on Australian explorers that aroused much controversy at the time, focusing as they did on the tragic history of the Aboriginal Tasmanians. In 1958 he exhibited a series of paintings based on the histological episodes in the explorations of Burke and wills and Bass and Flinders.Catalog, Exhibition by David Boyd: Oil Paintings, Australian Galleries, Notes by Jessie MacLeod, 28 October 1958 He joined the Antipodeans Group in the 1950s. Boyd discovered a technique in 1966 that he named Sfumato, after da Vinci's usage of the word to describe graduations of smoky tones in painting. Boyd's method achieved this effect through a new technique involving candle flame. Boyd and his family moved to Rome in 1961, and later moved to London. They also spent several years creating art in Spain and the south of France before returning permanently to Australia in 1975. David Boyd was artist-in-residence at the School of Law, Macquarie University, Sydney from 1993–1996. In a September 2004 art review, Alex McDonald of State of the Arts magazine stated that David Boyd's work was 'ahead of his time in addressing the mistreatment of Indigenous people in Australia, but commented that an 'explanation for his frosty reception from Australian critics and dealers may have something to do with his choice of subject matter'. McDonald explained that the controversy may have stemmed from the fact that the 'legal system, race relations and religion' are 'not exactly popular issues' and were not 'up for debate in the late 1950s'.

Its west end starts in Ontonagon and runs east to Baraga, some apart. The highway crosses streams and rivers in forest lands and provides access to a casino. The east end is located by the Keweenaw Bay of Lake Superior in the Keweenaw Bay Indian Community. There have been two highways in the state to carry the designation. The first was located in the southeastern Lower Peninsula. The current version of M-38 was created from a section of M-35 in the 1960s. This section was orphaned from the rest of M-35 when the highway was cancelled through the Huron Mountains. Route description M-38 begins at a four-way intersection in Ontonagon. US Highway 45 (US 45) runs north–south through this intersection while M-64 runs west and M-38 runs east on Steel Street. This intersection is both the eastern terminus of M-64 and the western terminus of M-38. From here, M-38 forms a segment of the Lake Superior Circle Tour along Ontonagon–Greenland Road to a junction with M-26 near Greenland. The roadway runs through forest land and crosses several small streams while traveling southeasterly. Outside of Greenland, M-38 curves to the north around town after intersecting Plank Road. On the east side of town, M-26 and M-38 meet and join in a concurrency after Ontonagon–Greenland Road meets Plank Road a second time. The two highways run together for just over a mile to the unincorporated community of Lake Mine. There, M-38 turns south through the community while M-26 turns off to the northeast. M-38 in Nisula The highway crosses a set of railroad tracks before turning east. At Post Office Road, M-38 meets a road named Old M-35 Road, a vestige of a highway straightening project during the time the highway was M-35. M-38 crosses the West Branch of the Firesteel River in hilly terrain through this area. The highway continues east and provides access to the Courtney Lake National Forest Campground west of the Houghton County line. East of Federal Forest Highway 16 (FFH-16) near Nisula, M-38 crosses the West Branch of the Otter River. It is along this section of roadway in Houghton County that the lowest annual average daily traffic (AADT) counts were measured by the Michigan Department of Transportation (MDOT) in 2007. An average of 680 vehicles traveled on the roadway, according to MDOT surveys. Of those vehicles, only 40 trucks on average were included in the traffic counts. East of Nisula, the roadway runs parallel to Mill Creek. Mill Creek flows into the West Branch of the Sturgeon River near the Baraga County line. East of the county line is the crossing over the Sturgeon River south of Pelkie, home of the Baraga County Fairgrounds. The trunkline crosses more hilly terrain while veering to the northeast. Continuing to the east, M-38 had its highest traffic usage in 2007. The AADT for the Baraga County segment of the highway was measured at 3,000 vehicles a day. The roadway continues east through Baraga County and runs downhill approaching Baraga and the Keweenaw Bay Indian Community, home of the first Native American casino in the United States. After passing through downtown Baraga on Michigan Avenue, M-38 ends at an intersection with US 41; on the western shore of Keweenaw Bay. History=Previous designation The first version of M-38 was designated in 1919 in the Lower Peninsula. It was located on Junction Road from M-10 (later US 10/US 23) southeast of Bridgeport to Frankenmuth, and then ran east to M-19 in the Peck area in 1919. The highway was transferred to county jurisdiction in late 1961 when Interstate 75 (I-75) was completed in the area. Current designation In January 1969, the Michigan Department of State Highways redesignated the western section of M-35 as M-38. M-35 was originally planned to start in Menominee and run north to Big Bay, turn west through the Huron Mountains in northern Marquette County and run west from Baraga to Ontonagon. The Huron Mountains portion of M-35 was never built due to opposition from Henry Ford and the Huron Mountain Club. This left M-35 discontinuous. It was later routed along US 41 from Negaunee to Baraga, connecting the two sections until the western section was given the M-38 designation. The original routing of M-38 in the Upper Peninsula ran from M-26 at Greenland to Baraga. US 45 was rerouted in 1971 along M-26 from Rockland to Greenland and Ontonagon–Greenland Road between those two towns. M-26 was shortened to end at the new US 45 in Greenland. This change to US 45 was reversed in 1973. M-26 was re-extended to Rockland, and M-38 was extended along M-26 to Ontonagon–Greenland Road to meet US 45 in Ontonagon. On October 11, 2006, the western terminus of M-38 was relocated about south to end at a junction with US 45 and the newly realigned M-64.

In captivity it can live for up to 35 years. It is found in lowland and montane, tropical and subtropical climates and in mountain rain forests up to 1,400 metres in Borneo, Sumatra, Java, the Malay Peninsula, Singapore, and southern Thailand. The rhinoceros hornbill is the state bird of the Malaysian state of Sarawak and the country's National Bird. Some Dayak people, especially the Ibanic groups, believe it to be the chief of worldly birds or the supreme worldly bird, and its statue is used to welcome the god of the augural birds, Sengalang Burong, to the feasts and celebrations of humankind. Contrary to some misunderstandings, the rhinoceros hornbill does not represent their war god, who is represented in this world by the brahminy kite.\\"Harrisson and Sandin give a slightly different interpretation. They state that the Hornbill image is used to show it, in an independent sense, as 'Chief of the Birds'. According to them it does not represent Lang, but quite simply represents a Hornbill, 'the Supreme Worldly Bird, who welcomes the invisible overhead approach of the God of Birds, Sengalang Burong' (1966: 124).\\" See p80 V.

Description The skull of B. r. silvestris The rhinoceros hornbill is a large arboreal hornbill, long. The weight varies by sex, with males weighing around and the females . The plumage is predominately black, with white legs and vent and a white tail with a black band. The huge bill and casque are orange and red, the colour coming from preen oil rubbed on from the preen gland above the tail. The eyes of the male are red with black rims, and white with red rims in the female. Behaviour=Diet and feeding A female eating a peanut The diet of the rhinoceros hornbill is dominated by fruit, but it will take any insect, small reptile, rodent, and smaller birds that it can catch. Breeding The courtship and bonding of these birds are critical, as the female must trust the male to provide her with everything when she is incubating and raising chicks. These hornbills make their nests inside tree trunks, and the female stays inside with the eggs and then with the chicks, while the male brings them food. After the eggs are laid, the male collects mud, and the pair pack that mud, along with food and feces, to wall up the entrance to the tree cavity. They leave a very small hole, just large enough for the male to feed the female, and later the chicks, and for the female to defecate through the hole. Once the chicks are fully feathered and old enough to leave the nest, the parents chip away the dry mud to let the chicks out. Status and conservation The rhinoceros hornbill faces a number of threats, including loss of its rainforest habitat, as well as hunting for its meat, and its skull and feathers. Habitat destruction has led to the loss of the large trees the species requires for breeding, which in turn makes it easier for poachers to find the rhinoceros hornbill. It is frequently shot at by poachers due to confusion with the highly sought-after helmeted hornbill. Due to this, the species was uplisted to vulnerable from near threatened on the IUCN Red List in 2018. Gallery Image: Rhinoceros_Hornbill.tifSepilok Nature Resort - Sabah, Borneo - Malaysia.

He was the older son of Negus Sahle Selassie and his wife Woizero Bezabish Wolde. Haile Melekot was half-brother to Darge Sahle Selassie. Rise to power His first wife was Woizero Ejigayehu (whom he married in 1844 and divorced in 1845); their one child, baptised Sahle Mariam, was renamed Menelik by Negus Sahle Selassie. Her background is disputed; some believe she was of Oromo origin, others insist that she was among the ladies who were brought from the Imperial court at Gondar to Ankober to instruct the royal women of Shewa on court etiquette so that the Shewan branch of the dynasty could adopt the same court practices as the elder Gondar branch.Marcus lists the numerous stories (Menelik II, pp. 16f), including \\"a persistent rumor\\" that Ijigayehu had been a Gurage slave. In May 1845 he married his second wife, Woizero Tideneqialesh, who was a former wife of a court official. Haile Melekot was known as Lij Besha Warad before he became king. It was well known that Sahle Selassie favored his younger son, Seyfe Sahle Selassie, and it was widely rumored that he would make his younger son his heir. However, he publicly announced that Haile Melekot would inherit the kingdom, had Seyfe swear to abide by this decision, and although mortally ill shortly before his death travelled to Debre Berhan where he asked his vassal Oromo lords to remain loyal to Haile Melekot.Marcus, Menelik II, p. 13 Nonetheless, in Mordechai Abir's words, Sahle Selassie's death \\"was a signal for a blood bath which surpassed anything that ever occurred in the annals of Showa.\\" The Abichu Oromo rose in open revolt, attempting to recover control of the district of Tegulet and came close to capturing the capital of Ankober. Only the loyalty of some of the other Oromo chiefs and the Shewan supply of firearms saved the capital. Haile Melekot afterwards managed to persuade the meet with him at Angolalla, where he persuaded them to end their revolt. By the beginning of 1848, he was firmly in control of his kingdom, and even organized a campaign against the Arsi Oromo, who had been raiding the south-western parts of Shewa for years. Reign Harold Marcus notes that \\"little is known or remembered of the reign of Sahle Selassie's son, except for its end.\\" While he is likely correct in stating that this lack of information \\"leads one to believe that his reign was undistinguished\\", one brief letter of Haile Melekot survives, undated but written in the spring of 1849 and addressed to \\"Victoria, Queen of the Ferangi\\" – i.e. the Europeans.This correspondence, with a discussion by Richard Pankhurst, has been published in David L. Appleyard (translator), Letters from Ethiopian Rulers (Early and Mid-Nineteenth Century) (Oxford: British Academy, 1985), pp. 79-84. According to Sven Rubenson, it was delivered by an Ethiopian pilgrim to the British consul at Cairo, who was on his way to Jerusalem; the pilgrim also informed the consul that a gift consisting of 26 elephant tusks and 31 rhinoceros horns were en route to the British at Aden. Although it was agreed that the pilgrim would stop on his return travel to pick up the British response, he was never seen again.Sven Rubenson, The Survival of Ethiopian Independence (Hollywood: Tsehai, 2003), p. 164. In this letter, Haile Melekot refers to the friendship between the United Kingdom and Shewa, asks why they did not send a servant on his father's death to bring condolences and for 1,500 Thalers, with a verbal message by the courier asking for skilled workmen. Misunderstanding the intent of this letter (and not for the last time the British government misunderstood Ethiopian customs), Lord Palmerston responded on 4 July 1849 that Shewa lay too far away to send any workmen \\"and, moreover, the workmen in her dominions are at present much employed.\\" With this letter a chest containing 300 sovereigns was sent; this gift was returned with a second letter containing the accusation that the coins were not made of gold but brass, and concluding, \\"Even if our friendship is gone, let there not be enmity between us.\\" Rubenson interprets this communication as evidence of Shewan \\"aloofness and suspicion\\" of European attention.He notes that the letter was sent not under the royal name of Haile Melekot, but as \\"Basad Wirad\\", the name he used before his coronation, and was most familiar to the Europeans visiting Shewa in his father's time knew him. The ruler, or at least his secretary, was unclear which country Victoria was queen over. As for the return of the coins, Rubenson believes \\"it is more likely that the King was prevented from accepting the gift by the same anti- European forces that had compelled Krapf and Harris to give up Shewa. Whatever the reason, the incident shows how difficult it was to create confidence and establish anythiing resembling ordinary diplomatic relations.\\"Rubenson, Survival, pp. 164f Inevitably, Haile Melekot's semi-independent kingdom (the Emperor of Ethiopia in Gondar was still nominally the liege lord of the King of Shewa) came to the attention of Tewodros II, a regional lord of Gonder, who successfully concluding the process of defeating the remaining local rulers (princes) of Ethiopia and reuniting Ethiopia. Haile Melekot allied himself with the Oromo in the province Wollo, which lay between him and Tewodros, but as Abir notes, he \\"was not made of the same stuff his father was, and could not provide the same inspiring leadership which had made Showa strong in the past.\\"Abir, Ethiopia, p. 180. The Shewan army failed to provide any effective help to the Oromo leaders in Wollo, and with an army of 50,000 men, Tewodros crushed his divided opposition. After a pause for the rainy season, Tewodros then entered northern Shewa in 1855. By this point Haile Melekot was discouraged and gravely sick.One source identifies the illness as malaria (Marcus, Menelik II, p. 18). His brother Seyfe, dissatisfied with his indecision, led the army south from Wollo to Menz then to Tegulet, abandoning Haile Melekot. The local governors were no match for the Emperor, and either were defeated or (like the governor of Efrata) went over to Tewodros' side. Rebellious Oromo burned Angolalla. The Negus of Shewa was horrified to learn that his mother Bezabish and his grandmother Zenebework (respectively widow and mother of the late Sahle Selassie) had crossed to the camp of Tewodros II and paid him homage in exchange for a guarantee that their personal lands would not be touched. A despondent Haile Melekot made a few skirmishes against Tewodros' forces, then destroyed his food stores and his capital of Ankober to keep it out of Tewodros' hands. He died of his illness in the town of Atakelt, and was hastily buried at Debre Gage in Tara. A handful of Shewan nobles fought on, until a final battle in Bulga, where they were defeated by a detachment of Tewodros' troops under Ras Ingida. Accepting that further resistance was not possible, they delivered Menelik, the son and heir of Haile Melekot, to Tewodros. Emperor Tewodros appointed Haile Melekot's brother Haile Mikael governor, and the independence of Shewa came to an end.  Aftermath  In an interesting postscript, Tewodros II is said to have disbelieved that Haile Melekot was really dead and demanded that his body be disinterred. When he saw the body of the dead king, the Emperor is said to have wept for him, saying it was a shame that illness should deny a brave man such as the King of Shewa, the honor of falling in battle. He ordered that Haile Melekot be re- buried with all the pomp and ceremony due to a king.Harold Marcus merely states that a Ge'ez manuscript written in Gondar, and now at the Institute of Ethiopian Studies in Addis Ababa, reports Tewodros attended his funeral.

They are often mentioned in journalism (cf. news style), research and police investigations. According to the principle of the Five Ws, a report can only be considered complete if it answers these questions starting with an interrogative word: * Who * What * When * Where * Why Some authors add a sixth question, how, to the list. Each question should have a factual answer—facts necessary to include for a report to be considered complete. Importantly, none of these questions can be answered with a simple \\"yes\\" or \\"no\\". In the United Kingdom (excluding Scotland), the Five Ws are used in Key Stage 2 and Key Stage 3 lessons (ages 7–14). Origin The Five Ws and How were long attributed to Hermagoras of Temnos. But in 2010, it was established that Aristotle's Nicomachean Ethics are in fact the source of the elements of circumstance or Septem Circumstantiae. Thomas Aquinas had much earlier acknowledged Aristotle as the originator of the elements of circumstances, providing a detailed commentary on Aristotle's system in his \\"Treatise on human acts\\" and specifically in part one of two Q7 \\"Of the Circumstances of Human Acts\\". Thomas Aquinas examines the concept of Aristotle's voluntary and involuntary action in his Summa Theologiae as well as a further set of questions about the elements of circumstance. Primarily he asks \\"Whether a circumstance is an accident of a human act\\" (Article 1), \\"Whether Theologians should take note of the circumstances of human acts?\\" (Article 2), \\"Whether the circumstances are properly set forth (in Aristotle's) third book of Ethics\\" (Article 3) and \\"Whether the most important circumstances are 'Why' and 'In What the act consists'?\\" (Article 4). > For in acts we must take note of who did it, by what aids or instruments he > did it (with), what he did, where he did it, why he did it, how and when he > did it. For Aristotle, the elements are used in order to distinguish voluntary or involuntary action, a crucial distinction for him.Sloan 2010, 236 These elements of circumstances are used by Aristotle as a framework to describe and evaluate moral action in terms of What was or should be done, Who did it, How it was done, Where it happened, and most importantly for what reason (Why), and so on for all the other elements: > Therefore it is not a pointless endeavor to divide these circumstances by > kind and number; (1) the Who, (2) the What, (3) around what place (Where) or > (4) in which time something happens (When), and sometimes (5) with what, > such as an instrument (With), (6) for the sake of what (Why), such as saving > a life, and (7) the (How), such as gently or violently…And it seems that the > most important circumstances are those just listed, including the Why. For Aristotle, ignorance of any of these elements can imply involuntary action: > Thus, with ignorance as a possibility concerning all these things, that is, > the circumstances of the act, the one who acts in ignorance of any of them > seems to act involuntarily, and especially regarding the most important > ones. And it seems that the most important circumstances are those just > listed, including the Why In the Politics, Aristotle illustrates why the elements are important in terms of human (moral) action: > I mean, for instance (a particular circumstance or movement or action), How > could we advise the Athenians whether they should go to war or not, if we > did not know their strength (How much), whether it was naval or military or > both (What kind), and how great it is (How many), what their revenues amount > to (With), Who their friends and enemies are (Who), what wars, too they have > waged (What), and with what success; and so on. Essentially, these elements of circumstances provide a theoretical framework that can be used to particularize, explain or predict any given set of circumstances of action. Hermagoras went so far as to claim that all hypotheses are derived from these seven circumstances: > In other words, no hypothetical question, or question involving particular > persons and actions, can arise without reference to these circumstances, and > no demonstration of such a question can be made without using them. In any particular act or situation, one needs to interrogate these questions in order to determine the actual circumstances of the action. > It is necessary for students of virtue to differentiate between the > Voluntary and Involuntary; such a distinction should even prove useful to > the lawmaker for assigning honors and punishments. This aspect is encapsulated by Aristotle in Rhetoric as forensic speech and is used to determine \\"The characters and circumstances which lead men to commit wrong, or make them the victims of wrong\\" in order to accuse or defend. It is this application of the elements of circumstances that was emphasised by latter rhetoricians. Rhetoric Even though the classical origin of these questions as situated in ethics had long been lost, they have been a standard way of formulating or analyzing rhetorical questions since antiquity.For more general discussion of the theory of circumstances, see e.g. Rita Copeland, Rhetoric, Hermeneutics, and Translation in the Middle Ages: Academic Traditions and Vernacular Texts, 1995. , p. 66ff, as well as Robertson The rhetor Hermagoras of Temnos, as quoted in pseudo-Augustine's De Rhetorica,Although attributed to Augustine of Hippo, modern scholarship considers the authorship doubtful, and calls him pseudo-Augustine: Edwin Carawan, \\"What the Laws have Prejudged: Παραγραφή and Early Issue Theory\\" in Cecil W. Wooten, George Alexander Kennedy, eds., The orator in action and theory in Greece and Rome, 2001. , p. 36. applied Aristotle's \\"elements of circumstances\\" (μόρια περιστάσεως) as the loci of an issue: :Quis, quid, quando, ubi, cur, quem ad modum, quibus adminiculis.Robertson, quoting Halm's edition of De rhetorica; Hermagoras's original does not survive :(Who, what, when, where, why, in what way, by what means) St. Thomas Aquinas also refers to the elements as used by Cicero in De Inventione (Chap. 24 DD1, 104) as: > Quis, quid, ubi, quibus auxiliis, cur, quomodo, quando. Similarly, Quintilian discussed loci argumentorum, but did not put them in the form of questions. Victorinus explained Cicero's application of the elements of circumstances by putting them into correspondence with Hermagoras's questions: quis=persona; quid=factum; cur=causa; ubi=locus; quando=tempus; quemadmodum = modus; quib/adminiculis=facultas Julius Victor also lists circumstances as questions. Boethius \\"made the seven circumstances fundamental to the arts of prosecution and defense\\": :Quis, quid, cur, quomodo, ubi, quando, quibus auxiliis. :(Who, what, why, how, where, when, with what) The question form was taken up again in the 12th century by Thierry de Chartres and John of Salisbury. To administer suitable penance to sinners, the 21st canon of the Fourth Lateran Council (1215) enjoined confessors to investigate both sins and the circumstances of the sins. The question form was popular for guiding confessors, and it appeared in several different forms:Citations below taken from Robertson and not independently checked. :Quis, quid, ubi, per quos, quoties, cur, quomodo, quando.Mansi, Concilium Trevirense Provinciale (1227), Mansi, Concilia, XXIII, c. 29. :Quis, quid, ubi, quibus auxiliis, cur, quomodo, quando.Constitutions of Alexander de Stavenby (1237) Wilkins, I:645; also quoted in Thomas Aquinas Summa Theologica I-II, 7, 3. :Quis, quid, ubi, cum quo, quotiens, cur, quomodo, quando.Robert de Sorbon, De Confessione, MBP XXV:354 :Quid, quis, ubi, quibus auxiliis, cur, quomodo, quando.Peter Quinel, Summula, Wilkins, II:165 :Quid, ubi, quare, quantum, conditio, quomodo, quando: adiuncto quoties.S.

Kendall Soulen, Handbook of Biblical Criticism, (Louisville, 2001, ) s.v. Locus, p. 107; Hartmut Schröder, Subject-Oriented Texts, p. 176ff In the 16th century, Thomas Wilson wrote in English verse: In the United States in the 19th century, Prof. William Cleaver Wilkinson popularized the \\"Three Ws\\" – What? Why? What of it? – as a method of Bible study in the 1880s, although he did not claim originality. This eventually became the \\"Five Ws\\", but the application was rather different from that in journalism: > \\"What? Why? What of it?\\" is a plan of study of alliterative methods for the > teacher emphasized by Professor W.C. Wilkinson not as original with himself > but as of venerable authority. \\"It is, in fact,\\" he says, \\"an almost > immemorial orator's analysis.

The \\"Five Ws\\" (and one H) were memorialized by Rudyard Kipling in his Just So Stories (1902), in which a poem, accompanying the tale of The Elephant's Child,The poem compares Kipling's own day-to-day situation as a writer/journalist, with that of Queen Victoria (\\"a person small\\") who \\"keeps ten million serving men\\", and, unlike Kipling, \\"gets no rest at all\\". opens with: By 1917, the \\"Five Ws\\" were being taught in high-school journalism classes,Leon Nelson Flint, Newspaper Writing in High Schools, Containing an Outline for the Use of Teachers, University of Kansas, 1917, p. 47. and by 1940, the tendency of journalists to address all of the \\"Five Ws\\" within the lead paragraph of an article was being characterized as old-fashioned and fallacious: Starting in the 2000s, the Five Ws were sometimes misattributed to Kipling, especially in the management and quality literature,Simon Burtonshaw- Gunn, The Essential Management Toolbox, 2009, , pp. 55, 68, 198e.g. in E.

Released on September 15, 1971, it was the first album on David Geffen's Asylum label. Backing musicians include John Beck and Jim Pons from the Leaves. While the majority of the album was produced by Henry Lewy, Graham Nash handled the duties for the single \\"Jesus Was a Cross Maker\\", with his production designed to aim for radio airplay. In 2017 Intervention Records reissued Judee Sill on 180-gram double 45RPM vinyl. The reissue earned a score of 10 for sound quality from noted vinyl critic Michael Fremer. Songs Sill had played piano since her childhood, and honed her skills at reform school in the early 1960s where she was sent for forging checks. After a drugs bust, Sill spent time in jail where she kicked her heroin addiction and made a promise to pursue a songwriting career. The songs that appear on Judee Sill were mostly composed in 1969–71. In 1969, Sill was hired by the Turtles to write songs for $35 a week for their publishing company, Blimp Music. The earliest of these are \\"Lady-O,\\" which was recorded by the band, \\"Crayon Angels,\\" \\"My Man on Love,\\" \\"Lopin' Along Thru the Cosmos,\\" \\"Enchanted Sky Machines,\\" and \\"Abracadabra.\\" The latest additions to the album were \\"The Archetypal Man,\\" \\"Ridge Rider,\\" and the single \\"Jesus was a Cross Maker.\\" Originally, two other new songs, \\"The Pearl\\" and \\"The Phoenix,\\" were slated for inclusion, but were removed from the track list to make room for \\"Jesus was a Cross Maker.\\" They were re-recorded and appeared on Sill's second album, Heart Food, in 1973. Musically, the songs are delivered in an acoustic style on guitar and, for \\"Jesus was a Cross Maker\\" and \\"Enchanted Sky Machines,\\" piano. The songs, after work by Sill and Lewy, feature elements of pop, folk, country, and gospel, but also strong classical influences. Two of Sill's biggest influences were Bach and Ray Charles. Lyrically, Sill's songs follow a theme of finding redemption. Live Sill began touring as an opening act in late 1970, a year before the release of Judee Sill. Her first major tour was with Crosby & Nash, and she also opened for Cat Stevens, Gordon Lightfoot and Tom Paxton. A full opening-act performance, recorded on October 3, 1971, in Boston in support of Crosby & Nash, appears on the Rhino reissue of Judee Sill. The set was recorded two days after the release of the \\"Jesus was a Cross Maker\\" single. Sill did not enjoy working as a support act. She told NME in April 1972: \\"At the start it was hell. As I walked on stage I used to think, \\"Oh God I'd rather die than do this. I'd rather stick a knife in my heart than go out and say, \\"Nice to be here!\\" Unfortunately, sometimes I've played with rock groups which is - urrrrrgh - terrible, ridiculous in fact. If somebody is ready to hear rock and roll they're ready to have a certain part of their mind or body stimulated. It's asking too much of anybody to suddenly switch round and have another part of them stimulated by something else.\\" Track listing All tracks arranged and composed by Judee Sill. ;Side one #\\"Crayon Angels\\" – 2:35 #\\"The Phantom Cowboy\\" – 1:40 #\\"The Archetypal Man\\" – 3:35 #\\"The Lamb Ran Away with the Crown\\" – 3:10 #\\"Lady-O\\" – 3:10 #\\"Jesus Was a Cross Maker\\" – 3:20 ;Side two #\\"Ridge Rider\\" – 4:28 #\\"My Man on Love\\" – 3:23 #\\"Lopin' Along Thru the Cosmos\\" – 3:00 #\\"Enchanted Sky Machines\\" – 2:40 #\\"Abracadabra\\" – 1:54 Personnel *Judee Sill – guitar, piano & vocals *Clydie King, Rita Coolidge, Venetta Fields – background vocals *Don Bagley, Bob Harris – orchestration *David Crosby - guitar *Graham Nash - organ & production on \\"Jesus Was a Cross Maker\\" ;Production *Henry Lewy, John Beck, Jim Pons - production *Graham Nash - production on \\"Jesus Was a Cross Maker\\" *Larry Cox - engineering on \\"Jesus Was a Cross Maker\\" *Gary Burden - art direction, design *Andy Zax - reissue production Versions and tributes to Sill Cass Elliot covered \\"Jesus Was A Crossmaker\\" on her eponymous fourth studio album in 1972.

The cod was dried on places like this one in Vágur on Suðuroy. It was laid on the flat rocks. The Sloop Period is a period in Faroese history, where the Faroese society transformed from a feudal society to a semi-industrial society. The period spans from the 1880s to the beginning of World War II. History The name of the period comes from the fact, that a lot of Faroese persons bought used sloops, mainly smacks, from the UK, and this gave an uprise in fishery on the islands. A smack is called slupp in Faroese, from the English word sloop. The Faroe Islands got their first fishing fleet. These fishing vessels were fishing from spring to autumn mainly in the waters around Iceland. Faroese women got an opportunity to earn money for the first time, when they went to work in the fish industry on land, the fish which the sloops brought to land. The sloops were fishing cod, which was dried and salted, also known as klippfisk because they were often dried by lying on bare rocks. There are still two smacks from the Sloop period in the Faroe Islands, which are still sailing, but nowadays mainly for pleasure trips. The smack Johanna TG 326 from Vágur, was built in Rye, East Sussex in 1884, sold to Grimsby in October 1894 and to Jákup Dahl in Vágur on Suðuroy in December 1894. It was in active fishery until 1972. In 1981 it was in very bad shape and sold for 1 DKK to the local fond named after the smack Johanna TG 326. They collected money in order to restore the vessel and they managed to get it back into its original shape. In Tórhavn they have maintained the smack Westward Ho TN 54, which was built in Grimsby in 1884 and sold to T.F. Thomsen in Tvøroyri in Suðuroy in 1894. The name was Westward Ho from the beginning in England until 1895. From 1895-1908 it was named Viking, and since 1908 it has been called Westward Ho. Since the smack came to the Faroe Islands it has been fishing in the waters near Faroe Islands, Iceland, Greenland, Jan Mayen, Bear Island (Norway), Rockall.

The sound effects were very realistic, and many listeners were not aware the broadcasters were not announcing the action live. At that time some major league teams and almost all minor league baseball clubs used recreations of their road games as an economy measure. Availability Founded in 1948, the network was mainly in Texas and the southwest but did have 9 affiliates in Oregon, an outlet in Los Angeles, Seattle, and as of Sept. 29, 1950, WHAV in Haverhill, Massachusetts. At one time, it had about 500 radio stations on the line, being second in size only to the Mutual Broadcasting System. Major League Baseball It carried various types of programs (for instance, late night band remotes were another feature carried by Liberty) but McLendon, known as the \\"Old Scotchman\\", and his daily ball game recreations off the Western Union ticker provided the big money maker. The recreations used himself and future sportscasting stars such as Lindsey Nelson and Jerry Doggett. It was a live, not recreated, game that provided McLendon and Liberty with their greatest career moment. The Scotchman himself was behind the Liberty mic at the Polo Grounds in New York for the October 3, 1951 finale of the three-game National League play-off series between the New York Giants and Brooklyn Dodgers). Radio was still the more popular nationwide medium then. With Russ Hodges' famous radio call limited to the Giants' network, McLendon's call is how most Americans heard the NL clincher, including Giant Bobby Thomson's ninth-inning three-run homer into the left-field stands to win it for New York. Excerpts of the McLendon broadcast were highlighted in the 2001 HBO documentary Shot Heard 'Round the World. Rights fees According to Time magazine articles of the era, McLendon only paid Major League Baseball $1,000.00 per year for the rights to broadcast the games, but in 1951, the leagues raised the price to $250,000.00 per year, and prohibited broadcasts in any city which had a minor league franchise and in the northeastern and midwestern United States.The Liberty Broadcasting System Liberty baseball commentators *Bud Blattner (1950-1951) *Jerry Doggett (1950-1951) *Gordon McLendon (1949-1952) *Lindsey Nelson (1950-1951) *Wes Wise Demise Sports were the lifeblood of the Liberty Broadcasting System. Restrictions on Major League Baseball broadcasts in minor league franchise areas, as well as bans on National Football League broadcasts within a 75-mile range of league cities, were the one-two blow which ended the network. Since the baseball games were a major draw for both listeners and affiliates, the blackout was a disaster for the fledgling company, which had only posted modest profits during its first few years of operation. More than 100 stations left the network, and, faced with mounting debts, on May 16, 1952, the network ceased broadcasting. National Basketball Association Liberty also broadcast NBA games from roughly, the 1950-51 through 1951-52 seasons.

The mixture was formerly used as a tear gas. All members and the mixture are colourless liquids, although commercial or older samples appear yellowish. Use as a weapon Xylyl bromide is an irritant and lachrymatory agent. It has been incorporated in chemical weapons since the early months of World War I. Some commentators say the first use was in August 1914, when the French attacked German soldiers with tear gas grenades, but the agent used in that incident was more likely to be ethyl bromoacetate, which the French had tested before the war. The first extensive use of xylyl bromide was the firing by German forces of 18,000 \\"T-shells\\" at Russian positions in the Battle of Bolimów in January 1915. The shells were modified 15 cm (6 inch) artillery shells containing an explosive charge and c. 3 kg (7 lb) xylyl bromide. The attack was a complete failure because the winter weather was too cold to permit an effective aerosol, and the agent was either blown back towards the German lines, fell harmlessly to the ground, or was insufficiently concentrated to cause damage. A similar attack at Nieuwpoort in March 1915 was also unsuccessful. Nevertheless, because of its ease of manufacture xylyl bromide was widely used in World War I, in particular as a component of the Germans' Weisskreuz (white cross) mixture. Structural isomers Three isomers, collectively referred to by CAS registry number , are: * CAS RN : o-xylyl bromide (2-methylbenzyl bromide, systematic name 1-(bromomethyl)-2-methylbenzene) (NIST record) * CAS RN : m-xylyl bromide (3-methylbenzyl bromide, systematic name 1-(bromomethyl)-3-methylbenzene) (NIST record) * CAS RN : p-xylyl bromide (4-methylbenzyl bromide, systematic name 1-(bromomethyl)-4-methylbenzene) (NIST record) In the absence of clarification, the name \\"xylyl bromide\\" may refer to any one of these isomers or a mixture of all three.

History The term grew in use in the British media to identify the group as socially homogeneous and also as a convenient label, similar to the Young British Artists and Britpop labels of the same period. Many of the group's members appeared with each other in film and television productions in the mid-nineties, and later cast each other in their own productions. The core members of the group had lived close to each other in the Primrose Hill area of north London, as well as in neighbouring Belsize Park and Hampstead; however, the social focus for the group was really the Notting Hill area, several miles away in west London. Core members According to her obituary in the New York Times, Annabelle Neilson became a mainstay of the set, which included the Gallagher brothers Liam and Noel, Kate Moss, and Jude Law and Sadie Frost (before their divorce). Other members included: Films Frost, Law, Pertwee and Miller set up their own production company, Natural Nylon, which made feature films starring many members of the original set. Although he had no locational ties to the group, Scottish actor Robert Carlyle has also consistently appeared alongside the Primrose Hill actors, and has come to be synonymous with this era of British cinema.

Publication history Frederick Foswell first appeared, as the Big Man, in The Amazing Spider-Man #10 (March 1964), and was created by Stan Lee and Steve Ditko. The character subsequently appeared in The Amazing Spider-Man Annual #1 (1964), Amazing Spider-Man #23-27 (April–August 1965), #29-34 (October 1965-March 1966), #37 (June 1966), Amazing Spider-Man Annual #3 (1966), Amazing Spider-Man #42-47 (November 1966-April 1967), #49-52 (June–September 1967). The Big Man also made appearances in Marvel Team-Up #40 (December 1975) and Marvels #2 (February 1994). The character died in Amazing Spider-Man #52 (September 1967). The Big Man received an entry in the Official Handbook of the Marvel Universe Deluxe Edition #16, and in The Official Handbook of the Marvel Universe: Spider-Man #1 (2005). Fictional character biography Frederick Foswell was born in Queens, New York. He worked as a reporter at the Daily Bugle for evidently quite a number of years, though the sliding timescale puts some of the hints of this into question: in the Night Raven story in Marvel Super-Heroes (UK) #394 (February 1983), Foswell is referred to as a friend of Scoop Daly and as having attended Scoop Daly's funeral. A man named Fredrick was shown working for the Bugle in Sgt. Fury #110. Foswell begins leading a double life as the Big Man, head of New York's crime and the boss of the notorious Enforcers. Frail and diminutive in stature, Foswell conceals his identity by wearing a mask, oversized coat, and giant platform boots whenever he appears as the Big Man. Although he has a considerable run of success as a crime boss, a confrontation with Spider-Man ends with his Enforcers being apprehended, and shortly afterwards the police deduce his identity and arrest him.The Amazing Spider-Man #10 (March 1964) After Foswell serves his sentence, his Daily Bugle boss J. Jonah Jameson rehires him, an act of trust which immediately earns Foswell's gratitude.Amazing Spider-Man #23 (April 1965) When another masked crime lord called the Crime Master arises, working in collusion with the Green Goblin, Foswell again begins wearing a mask - an eyepatched face that he uses as the alter ego Patch. Acting as a stool-pigeon, he tips off the police to planned crimes while getting scoops.Amazing Spider-Man #26-27 (July–August 1965) Hoping to learn how his co-worker Peter Parker (Spider-Man's alter ego) always gets great photos of Spider-Man, Foswell follows him, and witnesses a (faked) conversation between Parker and Spider-Man indicating they've been conspiring to ensure that Parker is always present when Spider-Man goes into action. Parker and Foswell occasionally work together, with Peter tipping off Foswell as Spider-Man before a major bust and then taking pictures to go with Foswell's stories. Following a crime war, the Kingpin takes over New York's underworld. Foswell, his ego smarting at seeing another man in his place, tries to reinstate himself as the Big Man, but the Kingpin outwits him, instead forcibly enlisting him as a lieutenant.Amazing Spider-Man #50 (July 1967) When Kingpin kidnaps Jameson because of his editorials on the new crime wave, Spider-Man tries to rescue him, but is beaten by Kingpin.Amazing Spider-Man #51 (August 1967) Kingpin tries to drown both Jameson and Spider-Man, but Spider-Man uses his webbing to create an air bubble that keeps them both alive. The attempted murder of Jameson turns Foswell against Kingpin, who, sensing this, tries to kill him. However, Spider-Man enters and stops him. While Kingpin and Spider- Man battle, Foswell runs into the basement of the Kingpin's building to try to help Jameson. When he finds Jameson, Foswell protects him from the thugs trying to kill him, and takes a bullet meant for him. The Kingpin escapes, and Foswell dies from the bullet wound. Jameson memorializes him as a hero in the Daily Bugle.Amazing Spider-Man #52 (September 1967) Frederick Foswell was revealed to have a daughter named Janice.

His Patch persona appears in the episode \\"Reinforcement\\". Spider-Man asks him about the Master Planner. Foswell later uses his Patch alias again in the episode \\"Accomplices\\" to obtain information about an auction between the factions of Big Man, Doctor Octopus, Silvermane and Roderick Kingsley.

The article is written by Foswell, himself. In a later article, Foswell revealed that 'The Big Man' is in a gang war with the Russian mob, which Aleksei Sytsevich is notably a part of. In yet another article, this time posted by Ned Leeds, Foswell's identity is reported to now be exposed and that Foswell has been arrested for his crimes as 'The Big Man'. Foswell was featured in one final article, again written by Leeds. According to the article, Foswell was murdered at Rykers Island penitentiary and his body was found in a storage closet.

For seven years he attended the Victorian Artists' Society evening life drawing class three nights a week.AlbertTucker (1914 - 1999) Biography, Lauraine Diggins Fine Art  Influences  Tucker's main inspirations include post-impressionists, expressionists and social realists, as well as personal experience. Tucker's work was strongly influenced by the realistic reflections of two important émigré artists, Josl Bergner and Danila Vassilieff, who arrived in Melbourne in the late 1930s about the same time that Tucker began to explore images of the Great Depression. Tucker also met Sunday and John Reed, members of the Contemporary Art Society, which was set up in 1938 by George Bell, in opposition to the government Australian Academy of Art, which was believed to promote conservative art and not the modernists.'Brief History', Contemporary Art Society of Victoria Tucker's first significant works were produced during his involvement in the army. In 1940, Tucker was called up for army service and spent most of his time working in Heidelberg Military Hospital drawing patients suffering from wounds and mental illnesses as a result of war. He produced three important works at this stage, Man at Table, a pen and ink illustration of a man whose nose had been sliced off by a shell fragment, The Waste Land, an image of death sitting on a stool watching and waiting, and Floating Figures, of two figures floating down a hall, a third with a demented smile. All of these images illustrated the horror and madness of war, but in a style reflecting his social realists surrealistic and expressionistic style. In 1942, Tucker was discharged from the war and returned to Melbourne. An impression of Australian soldiers, clutching young women was the catalyst for his series of works known as the Images of Modern Evil, Victory Girls, depicting Melbourne nightlife. Tucker also took to photography, both of his own paintings, and to record the ideas and scenes he used to compose them, and inadvertently created a document of his time.The Vine, Vintage Melbourne through the lens of Albert Tucker Angry Penguins Tucker associated with John and Sunday Reed, who saw connections between Tucker's work and other artists, angry at the social situation. This so-called \\"Angry Decade\\" of the 1940s, saw artists Tucker become associated with the Angry Penguins, a group of modernist artists including Joy Hester, Sidney Nolan, John Perceval, Arthur Boyd and Noel Counihan. The Reeds' property at Heide was a major outlet for the expression of avant-garde ideas. The modernists and social realists shared the same concerns. These artists wrote for the publication Angry Penguins, published by Max Harris. Tucker's original influences, Bergner and Vassilieff, were part of this group. Post war In early 1947, Tucker traveled to Japan with the Australian army as an art correspondent. He produced a monochrome pen drawing called Hiroshima; it contains no figures, just the aftermath of the atomic bomb blast, with tents and shelters littering the landscape. In 1954 he met Sidney Nolan in Rome, when he produced Apocalyptic Horse and began painting Australia from memory. He was exhibited in the Venice Biennale in 1956 and then spent two years in London painting the Thames Series. He then moved to New York in 1958 and his subjects switched from the city to outback Australia. Where some works of Sidney Nolan and Russell Drysdale had reached international level, Tucker rejected them as being nationalistic. He depicted the landscape as being a harsh, barren and sterile wasteland. He distorted stereotypes and icons of the Australian bush, including convicts, Burke and Wills and the Kelly Gang. He was influenced by the sheer barrenness and hopelessness that the outback conveyed, and added these icons as pawns to the outback's deadly game. In 1959, Tucker won the Australian Women's Weekly Prize, which enabled him to spend two years in New York producing the Manhattan Series and Antipodean Heads. In 1960 he was awarded the Kurt Geiger Award by MOMA Australia which he used to return to Australia and mount his first Australian solo exhibition. He subsequently settled in Victoria and in 1964 he married his second wife Barbara Bilcock. In 1990 the National Gallery of Australia held a retrospective of his work.James Mollison and Jan Minchin, Albert Tucker: A Retrospective, National Gallery of Victoria, 1990, p117 Personal life Albert Tucker and Joy Hester in 1939 In 1941, Tucker married fellow artist Joy Hester, and they had a son, Sweeney. It emerged many years later that Tucker was not the boy's biological father—it was probably Australian jazz drummer Billy Hyde, with whom Hester had had a brief affair. His marriage broke down in 1947 and Tucker travelled to Japan and Europe, leading a bohemian life, painting, exhibiting and taking odd jobs. When Hester was later diagnosed with Hodgkin's lymphoma, she gave Sweeney into the care of the Reeds, who adopted him. Joy Hester died in 1960, and Sweeney committed suicide in 1979.AlbertTucker(1914 - 1999) Biography Lauraine Diggins Fine Art In his later years in the 1980s, and especially after the deaths of John and Sunday Reed, Tucker took on the task of recording the history of the artists circle he had known: :...the thing I became aware of was that there was no human face for that period. So this is where the accidental historian came into play. Because when I thought of John and Sunday, Danila and Joy already gone, then the rest of us of course would follow in rotation. There’s no escaping that simple brute reality of existence, and so I developed this tremendous urge...to try and get what I could done in painting what I knew of them all.Albert Tucker, Interview with Stephen Feneley July 1998 ABC Express Highlights The result was the series of portraits known as Faces I Have Met. :In each one I was trying to free myself as far as I could of any negative emotion or from the tensions and strains and relationships that had surged all around. One has to free oneself of malice or resentment. So in a sense it was also a spiritual exercise in self-purging and cleansing.Albert Tucker, Interview with Stephen Feneley July 1998 ABC Express Highlights Tucker's work is represented in all of the Australian State galleries as well as the National Gallery of Australia, the Guggenheim Museum and MOMA in New York. Tucker married Barbara Bilcock in 1963. It was the second marriage for both. Tucker died in 1999. Barbara Tucker controls the Tucker estate.

Parish church  Tinahely's parish church, St. Kevin's church, lies 2 km to the east of the village in the townland of Kilaveny overlooking the valley of the Derry stream. The church was erected in 1843 when it replaced another structure located in the adjacent townland of Whitefield which had been burned down on November 11, 1798 by Yeomen soldiers in reprisal for local activity during the 1798 Rebellion. The Whitefield church was replaced by a temporary wooden structure until the erection of St. Kevin's church. The original structure had been erected during the Penal Laws in 1700 and was cruciform in style with two transepts and a nave. Nothing now remains of the original church except for the cemetery that was attached to it. No burials have taken place in the cemetery since the mid 1900s.

Then known as the Morning Sentinel, it bought the Reporter-Star in 1931, when Martin Andersen came to Orlando to manage both papers. Andersen eventually bought both papers outright in 1945, selling them to the Tribune Company of Chicago in 1965. In 1973, the two publications merged into the daily Sentinel Star.

Mount Stuart was the son of the John Stuart, 1st Marquess of Bute and the grandson of Prime Minister John Stuart, 3rd Earl of Bute. His mother was the Hon. Charlotte Jane, daughter and heiress of Herbert Windsor, 2nd Viscount Windsor. He was born at Grosvenor Square, London in 1767 and educated at Eton and St John's College, Cambridge. In 1790, he was elected Member of Parliament for Cardiff, a seat he held until his death. He was appointed Colonel of the Glamorganshire Militia in 1791 and was also Lord- Lieutenant of Glamorganshire between 1793 and his death. Lord Mount Stuart married Lady Elizabeth McDouall-Crichton, daughter of Patrick McDouall- Crichton, 6th Earl of Dumfries, and his wife Margaret (née Crauford), on 12 October 1792.

It is the home of the Belleville Senators of the American Hockey League (AHL). Built in 1978, it was then known as the Quinte Sports Centre and eventually Yardmen Arena. It is part of a larger recreational complex with several ice rinks, a pool and other facilities. Description The arena's name is in honour of a small group of railroaders known as \\"The Belleville Yardmen\\" who raised more than to contribute to its construction. The arena was built with an international sized ice surface of 200 ft. length by 100 ft. width. It was the largest ice surface in the Ontario Hockey League. This has since been converted to a standard NHL-sized rink. The arena is one of four ice rinks in the Quinte Sports & Wellness Centre complex. Yardmen Arena has two balconies, on opposite sides of the ice. It was the only arena in the Ontario Hockey League to have a second level of seating until Budweiser Gardens was built in London, Ontario in 2002. History The arena was opened in 1978. The Belleville Bulls started as a Junior Tier II team in the OHA. On February 2, 1981, the OHL granted an expansion franchise to the city of Belleville and the ownership group of Dr. Robert L. Vaughan & Bob Dolan, and the Bulls joined the OHL. The team played in the arena until 2015, when it was sold and moved to Hamilton. The Yardmen Arena has hosted the OHL All-Star Game twice, in 1983 and 2006. Yardmen Arena hosted an NHL pre-season game between the Washington Capitals and Winnipeg Jets on September 14, 2013 as part of the Kraft Hockeyville festivities. Nearby Stirling-Rawdon won the Kraft Hockeyville contest in 2012, but the original game scheduled between the Toronto Maple Leafs and Columbus Blue Jackets was cancelled due to the 2012-13 NHL lockout. During the 2015–16 hockey season, Yardmen Arena hosted three Federal Hockey League games, with the intent of the league exploring the location for a team. If Belleville had been given a franchise, their nearest opponent would have been the Watertown Wolves across the US/Canada border, about 100 miles away in Watertown, New York. The games all had the Berlin River Drivers as the home team against and the Port Huron Prowlers on December 12, the Danbury Titans on January 2, and the Dayton Demolition on February 13. In summer 2016, it was reported that the Ottawa Senators were considering moving their American Hockey League affiliate, then known as the Binghamton Senators, to Yardmen Arena for the 2017–18 AHL season. Upgrades would have to be made to accommodate an AHL franchise including repairing the boards, the floor refrigeration system, and increasing the arena's capacity. The transfer was confirmed in September 2016, after Belleville City Council approved a $20.5 million upgrade to the arena. The upgrades included an increase in capacity, a new NHL-sized rink, new home team dressing room, new refrigeration system, new score clock, new washrooms and a new public entrance and in effect lead to a rebuilding of the arena. The Belleville Senators agreed to a lease for eight years. The team played their first month of the 2017–18 AHL season on the road and opened their inaugural season at the Yardmen Arena on November 1, 2017, to a sold out crowd. On September 19, 2018, the Senators sold the naming rights of the arena and it became officially known as CAA Arena for the 2018–19 season. The naming rights contract is for seven years.

Marketed as being designed for fire fighting, search and rescue, maritime patrol, cargo, and passenger transportation, it has a capacity of of water, or up to 72 passengers. The name Altair was chosen after a competition amongst Beriev and Irkut staff in -- , as a reference to the name of the alpha star in the Eagle constellation and because: \\"Al\\" is the first part of the name of the Beriev A-40 Albatross amphibious aircraft, whose layout was the development basis for the creation of the Be-200; \\"ta\\" stands for Taganrog; and \\"ir\\" stands for Irkutsk. Development Initiated in 1989 under the design leadership of Alexander Yavkin, to meet a perceived need for a civilian flying boat smaller than Beriev's military A-40, the Be-200 shares a similar layout to the A-40 but is about half the weight. Russian government approval for a purpose-designed water bomber was granted on 8 December 1990. Details of the project were announced, and a model displayed at the 1991 Paris Air Show. In Perestroika-era Russia, Beriev needed funds to develop the new aircraft, and turned to the Irkutsk Aircraft Production Association (now part of the Irkut Corporation), which was looking to diversify into civilian projects, to help to develop and build the Be-200. Beriev was responsible for development, design and documentation; systems-, static-, flight- and fatigue-testing of prototypes; certification and support of the production models. Irkut's duties comprised production preparation; manufacture of tooling; production of four prototypes and production aircraft; and spare parts manufacture. Both companies now fall under the umbrella of the state-owned United Aircraft Corporation. Beriev developed unique fire-fighting equipment for the Be-200, allowing it to scoop water while skimming the water surface at 90-95% of takeoff speed. This system was developed using a specially modified Be-12P, coded '12 Yellow'. After installation of the fire-fighting system, the aircraft was registered RA-00046 and given the designation Be-12P-200. This modified Be-12 was used to develop both the fire-fighting system and methods of operation. The Be-200's first flight from land was scheduled for 1997, but was eventually achieved by the first prototype aircraft on 24 September 1998. The aircraft was then transferred from Irkutsk to Taganrog after 26.5 flying hours, and the first take off from water was conducted on 10 September 1999 in Taganrog. The second Be-200 flew on August 27, 2002. This aircraft was built as a Be-200ES, being fitted to the specifications of the launch customer, EMERCOM, the Russian Ministry of Emergency Situations. In 2001, as part of a marketing program, the Be-200 was displayed at two large exhibitions in the Pacific Ocean region; the International Maritime and Aerospace Exhibition LIMA'01 in Malaysia and the Korean Aerospace and Defence Exhibition KADE'01 in South Korea. In 2002, the Be-200 participated in international aviation exhibitions, successfully demonstrating its capabilities to potential customers in France and Greece with 15 demonstration flights made from land, eight from water. A total of over was flown across Europe. Irkut and EADS signed a memorandum of understanding in May 2002 to jointly carry out a market study and to define the conditions and costs of international certification and the logistics of setting up a worldwide after-sales service. The study was completed in July 2003, revealing a potential market for up to 320 aircraft over 20 years. The two companies, with Rolls-Royce Deutschland, planned to obtain Western certification during -- and offer a Rolls-Royce BR715 powered aircraft for Western markets. This version was to be given the designation Be-200RR. The original Be-200 prototype (RF-21511) was earmarked to be converted into the Be-200RR prototype. However, efforts were discontinued toward a Rolls-Royce version since a joint study concluded in 2004 that because the intended BR715 engine would require extensive redevelopment due to weight and salt-water corrosion issues, break-even would require sales of too many aircraft. The first production aircraft, a Be-200ES flew on . It was delivered to EMERCOM on . Seven aircraft have been ordered by EMERCOM, five have been delivered. The fifth airframe was used for the European certification process which was expected to be completed in 2008. EASA eventually certified the Be200ES-E on 7 September 2010. The remaining two were scheduled for delivery by the end of 2008. EMERCOM has an option to buy a further 8 Be-200s, with a decision expected during the latter part of 2008.Flightglobal—Russia's OAK in bid to boost sales of Be-200 In 2010, production of the Be-200 was decided to switch to the Centre of competence for amphibian aircraft and flying boats in Taganrog. An assembly line was set up using tooling and equipment received from Irkut's main manufacturing site in Irkutsk, Siberia. This will allow the Irkut Corporation to concentrate on other more lucrative projects. Production of the Be-200 will remain under the umbrella of the United Aircraft Corporation.Flightglobal—Russia sets up central production site for amphibious aircraft First Taganrog-built aircraft was delivered in early 2017. In April 2018, Safran and UEC Saturn agreed to re-engine the BE-200 with the PowerJet SaM146 from the Sukhoi Superjet instead of the Progress D-436. The hope was that the more-modern SaM146 engine, which has passed international certification and complies with prospective ICAO requirements, will allow the aircraft to be more fully introduced to the European and American markets. One snag was encountered in April 2019 when Russia's ministry of industry and trade objected to the Be-200ChS-146 project because the new engines contained components from NATO countries. However, the project was apparently only suspended and not cancelled, even though Russian certification of the re-engined aircraft has been pushed to November 2021. Design The Be-200's engines are located high and to the rear in order to keep them clear of spray. The Be-200 is a high-wing T-tail monoplane. The hull is of single step design with a high length-to-beam ratio, which contributes to stability and controllability in water. The Be-200 airframe is constructed of aluminium alloys with corrosion-protection treatments. Selective use is made of titanium, composites and other corrosion-free materials. The wings are fitted with underwing stabiliser floats. The hydraulically operated retractable landing gear units all retract rearward, and each unit is twin- wheeled. A water rudder provides steering when in the water. It can operate from either a 1,800 m long runway or an area of open water not less than 2,300 m long and 2.5 m deep, with waves of up to 1.3 m high. The aircraft is powered by two, over fuselage, pylon-mounted Progress D-436TP engines. The D-436TP is a specific \\"maritime\\" corrosion-resistant version of the D-436 three shaft turbofan engine, designed especially for the Be-200 amphibian, by Ivchenko Progress ZMKB and manufactured by Motor Sich in Ukraine. These are mounted above the wingroot pods on the landing gear fairings to prevent water spraying into the engines during take-off and landing. The Digital Flight Control (Fly- by-wire) cockpit is fitted with modern navigation systems such as satellite navigation, FMS, autopilot and weather radar. The ARIA 200-M all-weather integrated avionics system, developed by Honeywell with the Moscow Research Institute of Aircraft Equipment, uses six 152 x 203 mm (6 x 8 in) LCDs to display information to the crew of two. The multirole Be-200 can be configured as an amphibious water drop fire-fighting aircraft, a freighter, or as a passenger aircraft—the pressurised and air conditioned cabin allowing transportation of up to 72 passengers. The Be-200 can also be equipped for special missions. When configured as an air ambulance, the aircraft can carry up to 30 stretcher patients and seven seated patients or medical crew. In the search and rescue role, the aircraft can be equipped with searchlights and sensors, an inflatable boat, thermal and optical surveillance systems, and medical equipment. The search and rescue variant can accommodate up to 45 people. The aircraft is also capable of being configured for anti-submarine warfare duties. The Be-200 in amphibious water drop fire-fighter configuration suppresses fires by dropping water contained in eight ferric aluminium alloy water tanks, located under the cabin floor in the centre fuselage section. Four retractable water scoops, two forward and two aft of the fuselage step, can be used to scoop a total of 12 tonnes of water in 14 seconds. Alternatively, the tanks can be filled from a hydrant or a water cistern on the ground. The water tanks can be removed quickly for carrying cargo. Water can be dropped in a single salvo, or in up to eight consecutive drops. The aircraft also carries six auxiliary tanks for fire-retarding chemical agents, with a total capacity of 1.2 m³. The aircraft can empty its water tanks over the site of a fire in 0.8 to 1.0 seconds when flying above the minimum drop speed of 220 km/h (135 mph, 120 kn) Operational history fires in the summer of 2007, but has yet to secure any firm orders from Europe. The first documented operational use of the Be-200 was from . For this period a Be-200ES was operated from Sardinia (Italy) by SOREM, the official operator of fire- fighting equipment of Italian Civil Defense Department (Protezione Civile). The aircraft, flown by joint Russian-Italian flight crew performed more than 100 flights with about 90 hours flown. During seven hours of operational flights, the aircraft participated in the extinguishing of four forest fires and dropped . The partnership was renewed in 2005, with Be-200ES () based at Sardinia between July and September. The aircraft flew 150 hours covering 63 missions, including ferry flights, and 435 scoops and drops of water, the total mass of which exceeded . In 2006, aircraft () was again leased by the Portuguese Fire Fighting Services (SNBPC – Serviço Nacional de Bombeiros e Protecção Civil) for evaluation during the forest fire season. On , the Russian crew of the Be-200 leased by Portugal were carrying out a water pick- up from the Aguieira dam near Santa Comba Dão, when on climbing away they clipped treetops and at least one of the Progress D-436TP engines suffered ingestion damage and had to be shut down. The aircraft recovered safely to land at Monte Real air force base, from which it had been operating. After repairs, the aircraft completed the season in Portugal. In total, 42 flights were performed during operations in Portugal, with a total flying time of 119 hours. The aircraft performed 301 water scooping operations and dropped of water on fires.Flightglobal—Russian firefighting Be-200 under evaluation by Portugal stokes forest fire by dumping fuel In October 2006, two Be-200ES ( and ) were leased to Indonesia by EMERCOM, fighting firesSee 2006 Southeast Asian haze for more details on the 2006 fires in Indonesia for 45 days.

Beriev claims that representatives of the newly formed Portuguese government enterprise EMA (Empresa de Meios Aéreos) have expressed their interest in a long-term cooperation with Beriev and the Be-200 in Portugal. Two Be-200ES also operated in Greece, fighting the 2007 forest fires for the whole season and from . In April 2008, Azerbaijan became the first foreign customer for the Be-200, purchasing one Be-200ES from Russia. The aircraft (, formerly ) is operated by the Azerbaijan Ministry of Emergency Situations and can be operated as a fire-fighting, cargo and 43-seater passenger aircraft. In July--August 2010 it was used in Russia during the wildfires that spread across the country. In early December 2010, two Be-200ES aircraft were used to fight the 2010 Mount Carmel forest fire near Haifa, Israel.EMERCOM planes start putting out fires in Israel In Serbia one Be-200 belonging to Russian Ministry of Emergency Situations is stationed in summer on Niš Constantine the Great Airport. Aircraft has already operational history in 2012 and 2013. A Be-200 was dispatched by Russia in January 2015 to assist in search and recovery operations following the loss of Indonesia AirAsia Flight 8501 in the Java Sea. On October 20, 2015, two Be-200s were used by the Indonesian government to fight a forest fire in Sumatra. In August 2016 two Be-200 aircraft were sent to Portugal after being asked for help in extinguishing forest fires. Four days later it was reported that thanks to the work of the Russian Emergencies Ministry Be-200 pilots, the fire was prevented from spreading in the direction of two settlements: Castro Laboreiro with a population of 1,000 people, and Viaden de Baixo, where 15 farms were saved from fire, and Peneda-Gerês National Park. China bought two, with an option for two more, of the Be-200 aircraft during the Zhuhai Airshow in 2016. The contract was signed in June 2017. A firm called International Emergency Services (“IES”), housed at the Santa Maria Public Airport in California has been trying for some years to bring the BE-200 to the United States in its fire-fighting role. An organisation called the said in September 2014 that it had signed a collaboration agreement with IES to develop a U.S.-built BE-200 in Colorado; however, while the USAFAC website maintains a BE-200 photo, no further information is provided on the status of the project. There was also discussion at a Santa Maria Public Airport District meeting in October 2016 of IES, Seaplane Global Air Services (“SGAS”) and Airbus partnering to build the aircraft at the Santa Maria airport. Meanwhile, in September 2018, SGAS ordered from the manufacturer four Be-200ES aircraft with an option for six more. The first two aircraft will be equipped with D-436TP engines, the eight others with the SaM146 engines. According to some reports, SGAS has plans to wet- and dry-lease the water-bombers in partnership with IES, offering services in several countries, including the US, European nations, and Australia.

The Sleeman Centre has hosted concerts, sporting and family events as well as trade shows and conferences. It is home to the Guelph Storm of the major junior Ontario Hockey League. The arena hosted the 2002 Memorial Cup and the 2008 Founders Cup tournament. History The Guelph Sports and Entertainment Centre was built in 2000 at a cost of $21 million. A new arena for Guelph had been in discussion for well over a decade by Guelph City Council. The owners of the Guelph Platers, the OHL team at Guelph Memorial Gardens at the time, moved to Owen Sound in 1989 with one of the stated reasons was the lack of a new arena. Serious talks of a new arena for the Guelph Storm, which moved from Hamilton in 1991 and played out of the cramped Guelph Memorial Gardens, did not get started until the mid to late 1990s after the Guelph Storm's failed attempt to host the Memorial Cup. Finding a suitable location, as well as the cost, was debated for many years. Many sites had been looked at including the Memorial Gardens site, the Fountain Street parking lot, and in the west end of the city where there was plans to build a new recreation and community complex. When the Eaton's store at the Guelph Eaton Centre closed down, the city investigated the potential of building an arena where the now empty store stood. To acquire the property, the city had to purchase the mall from ING Barings for $1.7 million. The 5,000-seat arena was then built on the site of the former Eaton's store after the purchase of the mall in 1998 and demolition of the back section where the Eaton's store once stood. The city entered a public–private partnership agreement with Nustadia in 1998 to build and operate the Guelph Sports and Entertainment Centre for 30 years. The city contributed half of the cost of the project and also guaranteed a $9-million loan for capital costs, which was to be paid back by Nustadia. However, in 2001, the city of Guelph had to take over the $10 million \\"senior\\" loan for the Guelph Sports and Entertainment Centre, plus the $9.5 million \\"subordinated\\" loan the city was already paying due to Nustadia failing to make a June 1 quarterly payment of $181,250. The city had to pay $3 million over the a four-year span to make Nustadia's payments on its bank loan for the downtown arena. Nustadia stated that difficulties in making payments were attributed to a number of factors, including the failure to generate anticipated restaurant and food court revenue and lower-than-projected ticket sales from Guelph Storm hockey games. Nustadia expected 3,500 people per game but the average was closer to 2,800 in 2000–01. A four-year reprieve was granted by Guelph City Council so that Nustadia could operate under ideal conditions. Nustadia was to repay the money but with a clause in the agreement between the city and the developer giving either side the ability to walk away with no financial obligations to the other. That deal expired on June 30, 2005. In 2005, after the four year reprieve, the city took over ownership of the Guelph Sports and Entertainment Centre because Nustadia Developments Inc. decided to walk away from the downtown facility, completing a controversial transaction that had been expected for a few months. The deal at the time transferred the ownership from Guelph Centre Partners, a division of Nustadia that was managing the arena, to the city, and left the City of Guelph with nearly $4 million in unanticipated debt plus the $9-million loan previously guaranteed by the city.Guelph Mercury Articles http://kcal.ca/BidulkaGuelph.html In 2009, the City of Guelph announced plans to upgrade the Sleeman Centre starting spring 2010. This upgrade consisted of adding a video score clock to the arena that has four video replay screens as well as two LED rings at the top and bottom of the scoreboard. From 2009 to 2018, Guelph's junior B team, the Guelph Hurricanes (formerly known as the Guelph Dominators) moved to the Sleeman Centre for their regular season home games.

Layout In the main arena the seats are blue, with private suites located one level above the main seating area. The club seats are behind the player benches. There is also a restaurant behind the club seats as well as a 200 level VIP section on the same level of the private boxes. The arena has a standard four-sided scoreboard, which is blue to go with the arena theme colour. The concourse is wide and horseshoe shaped, as fans have to either exit to Old Quebec Street food court or go through the restaurant. Fans can walk all the way around the arena with uninterrupted views of the action on the ice.

It operated from 1964 to 2006, and was primarily used as an ice hockey venue for the Oshawa Generals. The auditorium was built as a replacement to the Hambly Arena, which burned down in 1953. The auditorium was part of a larger multi- purpose recreational complex. Construction The construction of the auditorium was led by a committee of residents with the slogan: \\"Let's build it ourselves, for ourselves.\\" Volunteers raised $1.4 million from the community to fund the project, including $476,000 from the local General Motors employees union (Canadian Auto Workers) through payroll reductions. The City of Oshawa provided 20 acres of land on Thornton Road South, previously designated for a cemetery. Groundbreaking for the project took place on February 28, 1964, and the formal opening took place on December 11, 1964. The auditorium capacity was 3,625 seated, and 4,025 including standing room. History The Oshawa Generals began play at the auditorium on December 15, 1964, and won 6–4 over the St. Catharines Black Hawks. While playing at the auditorium, the Generals won five J. Ross Robertson Cups, and the 1990 Memorial Cup. The Oshawa Generals hosted the 1987 Memorial Cup tournament at the auditorium. The Generals played their final at the auditorium on October 29, 2006, and won 8–6 over the Kingston Frontenacs. The Oshawa Legionaires won three regular season Metro Junior B League titles playing at the auditorium. The Oshawa Green Gaels moved into the auditorium partway through their seven consecutive Minto Cups from 1963 to 1969. The auditorium hosted the inaugural Wrigley Cup in 1974, a national midget hockey tournament for the top 12 teams in the country set up by Jack Devine and the Canadian Amateur Hockey Association. On April 22, 1979, the auditorium hosted two benefit concerts for the Canadian National Institute for the Blind by the Rolling Stones, after Keith Richards was charged with possession of heroin. The auditorium became home to the Oshawa Sports Hall of Fame on May 21, 1986. The auditorium became home to the world's longest hockey stick in 2003. In May 2006, Alice Cooper was one of the final concerts at the auditorium. Replacement In June 2005, construction began on a replacement arena in downtown Oshawa. The General Motors Centre opened as the city's new primary hockey venue in October 2006. The auditorium sat idle until demolition between April and July 2010. The former site of the auditorium became an indoor turf field.

It is located on the campus of Lambton College and opened in September 1998. The Progressive Auto Sales Arena is currently home to the Sarnia Sting OHL ice hockey team. The Sarnia Legionnaires (1969–) Junior B hockey club holds its training camp at the facility before moving to Sarnia Arena for its regular schedule. The arena features two NHL-sized ice pads, 43 luxury suites, and an in-house, full- service restaurant. Artists such as Crash Test Dummies, Blue Man Group, Bryan Adams and Elton John have played there, and it has also hosted Stars on Ice. History In 1994, the Newmarket Royals team was bought by the Ciccarelli brothers and moved to Sarnia, where they were renamed the Sarnia Sting. Though the Sting played their first three seasons at the Sarnia Arena, their relocation was conditional on a new arena being built by the city. The new arena would also become an issue in the November 1994 municipal elections. There were five sites up for consideration: *The former CNR railway lands on the banks of the St. Clair River. Proponents argued that placing the new arena here would revitalize Sarnia's declining waterfront. CNR maintained that they would restore the grounds before selling it for development. However, opponents pointed out that the site is not located close to major highways or hotels. More importantly, it was adjacent to the Imperial Oil plant in Chemical Valley and company officials warned that they would be unable to evacuate the arena if an accident occurred. *A vacant park, just next to CNR lands, bounded by Front Street, Christina Street, and Devine Street. Though considered a separate site, some suggested that it could be combined with the CNR lands for future expansion. *The former Holmes Foundry Caposite Plant site, bounded by North Christina Street and Exmouth Street. This was considered the best location, since it was close to the Blue Water Bridge border crossing, Highway 402, and the nearby Venetian Boulevard had several hotels (Holiday Inn, Best Western Guildwood Inn), with another hotel (Days Inn) and the Sarnia Golf and Curling Club on Christina Street. However, this was located in the village of Point Edward and many Sarnians, for political reasons, were opposed to building their arena there. (It was considered a lengthy and complicated process for Sarnia to annex the land from Point Edward.) *Lotte Neeley Park, on the northeast corner of the Highway 40-Highway 7 interchange (Highway 7 has since been downloaded to municipal authorities and renamed London Line 22). It has the advantage of being accessible to the aforementioned routes, Highway 402, and Sarnia Airport. In addition, there are plenty of motels and restaurants on Highway 7, which was known as the \\"Golden Mile\\" prior to being largely bypassed by Highway 402. *Lambton College, where the arena could take advantage of vacant parking lots. The proposed arena would be close to the Canterbury Inn hotel (now Lambton Inn), and shopping establishments on Murphy Road and Exmouth Road, namely big box stores and Lambton Mall. It is also close to Highway 402 and Highway 40, and is a short distance from the Highway 7 motels and restaurants Originally known as the Sarnia Sports and Entertainment Centre, the Royal Bank of Canada purchased the naming rights of the arena in October 2009 and renamed it RBC Centre. In September 2015, RBC chose to not renew the sponsorship, thus reverting the arena back to its original name. During the summer of 2016, the City of Sarnia reached an agreement with Progressive Auto Sales on a 10-year naming rights agreement. The new name became Progressive Auto Sales Arena. Renovations are taking place in December when the old scoreboard is going to be taken down along with the ad boards around the suites. A new LED scoreboard is being installed and a LED ribbon board around the suites and the approx. cost is $500,000.

Marie, Ontario, for 57 years from 1949 to 2006. It was located in the heart of the downtown district at 169 Queen Street. The Gardens was one of the first Northern Ontario arenas to have artificial ice, and seated 3,990 spectators. The arena was built as a war memorial, and hosted several teams over the years, but was primarily home to the Sault Ste. Marie Greyhounds of the Ontario Hockey League. The Memorial Gardens was ultimately replaced by the Steelback Centre, built directly adjacent to where the Gardens once stood. Beginning of an era On January 7, 1946, the City of Sault Ste. Marie voted to construct a new recreational facility with an arena. It was approved by city residents via questionnaire to replace the then existing Gouin Street Arena. Plans originally intended the facility to be multi-purpose, including an indoor pool, auditorium, and large outdoor fountains. Cost estimates at the outlook of the project were in the range of $400,000 CAD. The official groundbreaking ceremony took place on September 18, 1946. Work on the massive structure would take two and a half years to complete. Once completed, total costs were approximately $765,000 CAD. The Memorial Gardens officially opened February 20, 1949, with a crowd of 8,500 to mark the official dedication. About the Gardens The design of the Gardens' front facade was representative of Streamline Moderne architecture style, using straight lines and curved forms. The main entrance and lobby were on the first floor at street level, and the Greyhounds team offices were on the second floor above. Inside the front doors, the lobby featured cast iron gates through which spectators filed to have their tickets taken. Inside these gates were concessions and entrances to the seating areas. The seating area had main concourse around the top of arena, and an aisle around the boards at ice level for movement of spectators. The benches for hockey teams, and penalty boxes were located in these aisles. The seats were all wooden benches, painted light blue. The Gardens had more rows of seats at the ends of the arena, than along the sides. The concourse and seats along the sides, sloped downwards from the end sections, towards the middle sections. As a result of this there were four full sections in the Gardens in which every single seat was tilted on a diagonal angle. The upper concourse area was very narrow, along the sides, and it was also the standing room area. Memorial Tower The Gardens' most distinctive feature was the Memorial Tower and red-lighted beacon. The beacon was lit on nights the Greyhounds played home games. The tower was also in commemoration of soldiers who made the ultimate sacrifice during World War II. At the base of the tower, inside the building, stands a list among wreaths, bearing the names of those of Sault Ste. Marie's bravest who did not return. The tower is all that remains from the demolished structure of the Gardens. Other features Inside the Gardens, high above the ice at the south end was a memorial fresco featuring stained glass panels and a bronze angel, commemorating the war dead. The exterior of the south end of the arena had a large Greyhounds logo and a list of all the years that Sault teams had won league championships and the Memorial Cup. Underneath the stands on the east side, in the corridor beside the Greyhounds dressing room, was the \\"Greyhounds alumni wall\\". Every Greyhounds alumnus had his name painted on the wall under the year in which he graduated from the team. The exact wording at the beginning of the list read: Structural changes Since its inauguration in 1949, the building has seen some dramatic changes. * Interior lighting above the ice (1950) * Acrylic glass around the ice replacing chain link fencing (1952) * Metal roofing replacing roof shingles (1978) * Electrical wiring brought up to code (1980s) * Heating & Ventilation system upgrades (1980s) * Changeroom renovations (1980s) * Fire alarm system and Public Address system upgrades (1990) * Luxury boxes and media gondolas added (1993) * Exterior refinishing & whitewashing (1997) End of an era The last Greyhounds game was played on March 28, 2006, a playoff game versus the London Knights. David Bolland of the London Knights scored the last goal, in game four of the first round playoff series. The building was officially decommissioned and closed to the public on April 9, 2006 in much the same fashion that it was ceremonially opened. Royal Canadian Legion members and other dignitaries were on hand to bid farewell to an important piece of Northern Ontario, and Sault Ste. Marie's heritage. Demolition of the building's interior began on April 27, 2006, with final exterior demolition beginning May 27, 2006. At the time of demolition, the Sault Memorial Gardens was the second oldest operational arena in the Ontario Hockey League. Only the Windsor Arena was older. All that remains of the former building is the preserved Memorial Tower, and its beacon. The decision not to demolish the tower, shows its importance to local history, and to remember war veterans. The city block that contains the site of the tower, and the arena facility, is now known as Memorial Square. Events The Memorial Gardens played host to the Memorial Cup tournament in 1978 and 1993, as well as the 1979 OHL All-Star Game. The last big tournament played in the Gardens was the 2003 Air Canada Cup, Canada's national midget hockey championship. Aside from hockey, the 1990 Labatt Brier, the Canadian men's curling championship, and the 1996 Canadian National Gymnastics Championship were hosted in the Gardens. Artists that have performed at Memorial Gardens include, Stompin' Tom Connors, Randy Travis, Tom Cochrane, Bob Dylan, Kenny Rogers, Alice Cooper, Billy Ray Cyrus, Rush, The Tragically Hip, Rita MacNeil, Bryan Adams, Johnny Cash, Roy Orbison, Willie Nelson, Helix, Great White, and Honeymoon Suite, among others. Other larger performances include WWF Wrestling, Smurfs on Ice, and the PharmAssist Skate the Nation Tour. Photo gallery File:Sault_Memorial_Gardens_1.jpg Front entrance.

It is home to the Sudbury Wolves of the Ontario Hockey League. It has an ice size of 200' x 85', with a capacity of 4,640 seated, 5,100 standing and is wheelchair accessible. During the summer of 2007, the arena underwent extensive renovations, which added 12 private boxes and a new club seating section, with padded seats and refreshments services along with new washrooms, concession stand and lounge. Seating was sacrificed to make way for the improvements. Standing room capacity was shrunk from 1,000 to 500, while seating capacity was dropped by 150. The new arena capacity, with standing room patrons, became 5,100, down from 5,750. On November 5, 2015, a life size statue of Stompin' Tom Connors was unveiled on the grounds of the arena.

Established in November 1991, it became part of Dixons Retail in February 1993, and then part of Dixons Carphone, after the merger of Dixons Retail and Carphone Warehouse in August 2014. All of its physical shops in the United Kingdom now trade under the combined \\"Currys PC World\\" brand. All stores of PC City in Italy have now ceased trading.  History  In November 1991, Vision Technology Group Ltd, led by Jan Murray, opened the first PC World shop in Purley Way, Croydon. In February 1993, when Dixons Group plc (now Dixons Carphone) purchased the chain, there were four PC World shops in existence. There followed a period of expansion, as more shops were opened across the country. Jan Murray attainined an annual turnover of £50 million by April 1992, as he had opened the four largest flagship stores around London. This expansion was partly driven by a series of acquisitions, beginning with DN Computer Services in November 1996, followed by Byte Computer Superstores Ltd in April 1998, and MicroWarehouse in June 2004. In September 2006, PC World UK assumed management control of its French subsidiary. In 2006, there were 163 PC World shops in the United Kingdom and Ireland. In the United Kingdom, PC World Business was launched in September 1997. Since March 2001, PC World Business has been based in Bury, Greater Manchester, and has its own management team. In October 2006, PC World launched \\"The Connected Home\\", selling PC based home entertainment systems and installation services. During 2007 to 2008, PC World was due to undergo a style change, with a proposed new logo, staff uniforms, shop layouts, as part of its image re branding programme. The changes were trialled at branches in Brentford, Colchester, Portsmouth, Bournemouth, Southampton, Isle of Wight, Enfield, Burnley and North Shields. In August 2008, the \\"proposed\\" logo was shelved, in favour of a new logo. In December 2008, PC World reported its first ever loss, posting underlying losses of £29.8 million in the six months to October 2008, compared to a £52.4 million profit in 2007.  PC World today  PC World, Kensington High Street, London, (2010) PC World, Kingston Park, (2007). The shop carries the previous logo. (2000 to 2008) Outside Southampton Central PC World (December 2006). The shop carries the proposed \\"new\\" logo. (This was not rolled out, and a different design was later chosen.) The shops offer ranges of consumer oriented PCs, laptops and peripherals, including DSG shops' own brand Advent and PC Line. Shops also have a \\"KnowHow desk\\", which offers advice and services. Some shops also have a \\"Component Centre\\" area, which contains more basic PC components such as motherboards, hard drives and cases. On 13 December 2007, it was announced that PC World would begin selling Dell PCs in their shops. This was one of many moves Dell made to sell their desktops and laptops to a wider market. This also includes Dell selling their XPS systems in many HMV shops across the United Kingdom. PC World opened their first two in one megastore with Currys at Wandsworth Bridge, Fulham, on 29 October 2009, followed by Merry Hill Shopping Centre (West Midlands), Aintree (Merseyside) Teesside Park (Stockton- on-Tees) and Bridge of Dee (Aberdeen) in June and July 2010. PC World closed their last remaining standalone shop in Ayr, in the week commencing 26 March 2018. PC World’s website was merged into Currys in July 2019, resulting in the end of PC World as the separate retailer.  Criticisms  In February 2005, PC World attracted criticism, for the strong promotion of extended warranties (also known as insurance and support packages) and in May 2013, if an extended warranty is not purchased, customers are required to use outsourced, local rate telephone support for hardware issues or premium rate telephone lines (£1/minute, except for set up which is 75p/minute) for software issues. An internet survey by Which? in June 2004 ranked PC World joint last for customer satisfaction. In March 2006, PC World attempted to get away from its reputation for having sales staff on up to 20% commission, who would therefore use high pressure sales tactics with its \\"One Team\\" marketing campaign. The bonus is also based on other non monetary metrics, such as customer satisfaction. To compensate the 275 highest earners under the old scheme for reduced bonuses, their basic pay was raised by 16% from around £11,000 to around £13,000 per year. In December 2007, in an response to the perception that PC World staff are often young, and lacking in knowledge and communications skills, a set of e-learning courses called \\"The Power of Knowledge\\" were completed by 6,000 staff.Survey completed by staff The results were incorporated into their Christmas bonuses, as an incentive for staff to improve their knowledge. Another survey for Which? in January 2008 revealed that PC World was ranked in the bottom ten retailers in the United Kingdom. In June 2014, Which? also reported PC World overcharging for repairs, and lack of technical competence among technicians. This was from seven sampled shops. In March 2014, an \\"offensive\\" PC World logo was visible, if you had typed 'computer superstore' on Google. In June 2014, the BBC's consumer awareness programme Watchdog found that PC World was accused of misselling HDMI cables in 9 out of 15 test purchases, claiming that the more you pay the better the quality, which was a false statement.  Controversies  In November 1997, Gary Glitter took a laptop into a branch of PC World in Bristol for repair, where child abuse imagery was found by staff, who informed the police and Glitter was subsequently charged and found guilty of possessing child pornography. This conviction severely damaged Glitter's reputation, and effectively ended his career. In January 2006, after numerous complaints, PC World was forced to remove an advert, that gave misinformation about wireless networking. There have also been countless other complaints over adverts, particularly regarding goods advertised, but not actually available in the shops. In September 2007, a customer alleged that when he returned a laptop under warranty with a faulty hinge, PC World refused to honour their warranty because he had installed a Linux operating system on the laptop, and therefore had invalidated the warranty he had had on the product, although the fault was a hardware matter and would not have been affected by the operating system installed. In September 2009, PC World staff were investigated for posting abusive and offensive comments about customers on Facebook. Locations A combined Currys PC World was created here, on the Headrow, Leeds. This was when the Currys branch on Briggate was relocated within this PC World. (2013) PC World currently trades only in the United Kingdom and Ireland. It has previously traded in other European countries, but has disposed of these as the parent company refocussed. The European shops traded under the name PC City. In February 2007, the French shops were the first of the Mainland Europe shops to be closed down. In April 2009, the Swedish shops were closed down, and the online operation then switched to the ElectroWorld brand. 34 shops in Spain also operated under the brand PC City. In April 2011, however, all Spanish shops were closed, as part of Dixons Retail's withdrawal from the market in Spain.Link to PDF press release See also * Dixons * The Link ReferencesExternal links * PC World (UK) * PC World (IRL) Category:Consumer electronics retailers of the United Kingdom Category:Dixons Carphone Category:Retail companies of the United Kingdom Category:British companies established in 1991 Category:Retail companies established in 1991 Category:1991 establishments in England ","title":"PC World (retailer)"},{"id":"1890173","text":"Milton J. Franklyn (né Milton Julius Frumkin; September 16, 1897 – April 24, 1962) was a musical composer and arranger who worked on the Warner Bros. Looney Tunes animated cartoons. Career Franklyn was born in New York City September 16, 1897, to the marriage of Julius B. Frumkin (1874–1913) and Fanny Hertzberg (maiden; 1876–1932). Julius Frumkin had been the proprietor of Frumkin's Cigar Stores in Salt Lake City, notably the Mission Cigar Store at 139 South Main Street. Franklyn was three years old when his family moved from New York to Salt Lake City. Franklyn attended high school in Salt Lake City and graduated June 10, 1915. He finished one year at the University of Utah. He was the state junior tennis champion in Utah for six years.Oakland Tribune, June 30, 1929 The next two years were spent at the University of California, Berkeley, then he began a term at Pennsylvania University when he was called to service in World War One. Franklyn did not serve overseas; he trained as a naval officer for three months and then the Armistice was signed on November 11, 1918. He returned to Berkeley to finish his education.Long Beach Independent, June 30, 1957 As Franklyn could play a number of instruments, he joined a band in San Francisco and for the next few years played at the Palace and St. Francis hotels. He began his own nine-piece orchestra, known at various times as the Peninsula Band, the Super Soloists, and the Merrimakers, and appeared in San Mateo (1926 to June 1927), where he also owned a music store,San Mateo Times, December 2, 1926 and San Jose (1928 to January 1929), where he was Master of Ceremonies and wrote revues for the California TheatreSan José Evening News, Oct 27, 1928 before moving on to Fresno and Oakland. For two years he was emcee with Fanchon and Marco at Fox West Coast in San Diego; musical director and emcee with Paramount Publix Corporation, travelling to Seattle, Denver, Houston and Toledo; and finally worked on the Loew's circuit in Providence, Rhode Island and New York City from 1933 to 1935. Franklyn quit vaudeville to go to Hollywood in 1935 and spent a year doing occasional work. In early 1936, he joined Warner Bros. as music arranger to Carl Stalling, becoming music director in 1953. The first cartoon with Franklyn credited as a composer was Bugs and Thugs, released in 1954, though Franklyn estimated at the time his 599th cartoon for Warners was Past Perfumance.Long Beach Independent, August 15, 1954 Franklyn always composed his scores at home early in the morning; he only went to the studio to watch the 30-piece Warner Bros. Orchestra record the music or to view the finished cartoon. Among the songs Franklyn is said to have composed with director Chuck Jones and writer Michael Maltese is The Michigan Rag for the 1955 cartoon One Froggy Evening, featuring Michigan J. Frog.The Warner Bros. Cartoons, Friedwald and Beck, 1981. However, the ASCAP database lists only Maltese as the composer. He became the sole composer in 1958 upon Stalling's retirement. Death Franklyn died of a heart attack on April 24, 1962. At the time of his death, Franklyn was composing the score for a Tweety cartoon, The Jet Cage. The first two minutes of the cartoon were scored by Franklyn, the rest by William Lava, who had been working on the Warner Bros. main lot and replaced him as musical director. The Jet Cage opening credits lists Franklyn and not Lava, while the ASCAP database credits Franklyn with composing the opening title, with no mention of Lava, but a change in composing style in the cartoon is noticeable. Franklyn joined ASCAP in 1954 and was a member of the Academy of TV Arts and Sciences. He and his wife Charlotte K. Franklyn were registered Democrats.California Voter Registrations, 1946 After his death, Franklyn's music also appeared in Bugs Bunny on Broadway.

This district area is 3,811.9 square kilometres, and population (year 2000 census) was 35,300. It is 1200 km from the state capital, Kuching and 200 km from the capital city of Sabah, Kota Kinabalu. Etymology There are several versions of the origin of the name \\"Lawas\\". It reportedly came from the Malay word luas which means \\"spacious\\". During the earlier days, people tend to settle down in spacious areas and thus the town was born. In another version of the story, there was once a group of merchants who were attacked and chased by the pirates at the mouth of the Lawas river. The merchants managed to hid themselves in the middle of the jungle and the pirates could not find them. Feelling relieved and secure, the merchants returned to the sea. In the local dialect, \\"Lawas\\" means \\"relief, safe, and secure\\".  History  On 7 September 1901, British North Borneo Company (BNBC) had obtained the administrative rights of the Lawas river from Brunei Sultanate in order to stem the smuggling of weapons that worked against the BNBC government in North Borneo (present day Sabah) and the trading of slaves in the interior of the Lawas district. There were two types of rights exist in the Brunei administrative system: sungai kerajaan (government river) and sungai tulin (private river). Government control on the river includes the rights to all the minerals mined from the river and the right to interfere if there is any political disturbances around the river. Private ownership of the river functioned like a private inheritance which includes the right collect taxes from the residents living near the river. At that time, Pengiran Abu Bakar and Pengiran Tajudin had the private ownership of the Lawas river. They refused to surrender their private ownerships to BNBC but keen to sell their rights to Kingdom of Sarawak. When the British Consul at Labuan decided that BNBC should take over the Lawas river by force, Pengiran Abu Bakar quickly invited Rajah Charles Brooke from Kingdom of Sarawak to govern the Lawas river. BNBC initially was unhappy with the Brooke involvement in the administration of Lawas river. However, in November 1904, BNBC decided the sell their administrative right to Brooke in view of private owners unwilling to cooperate with BNBC; taking Lawas river by force will only spark more rebellion against BNBC and drain the BNBC cash reserves. On 19 January 1905, an agreement was signed between BNBC and Rajah Charles Brooke which saw the official handover of Lawas river to the Brooke government in exchange of 5000 pounds and several administrative areas around Brunei bay to BNBC. An agreement was later reached with the private owners to sell Lawas river to the Brooke government with reparation of 6,000 dollars per year to the private owners. GovernmentGeography and climateDemographics File:SIB Kampung Baru Mission, Lawas.jpgThe Borneo Evangelical Mission (SIB) church Lawas is made up of a population comprising Lun Bawang, Brunei Malay, Kedayan, and Chinese. The main spoken language is Brunei Malay, Kedayan, Lun Bawang and Hokkien.  Economy  As with Limbang, the town is a busy transit point between Sarawak, Sabah, and Brunei. Timber and agriculture are the mainstays of the economy. The highland area known as Ba'Kelalan has been experimenting with the cultivation of apples. In addition, the tourism industry is being developed in Ba'Kelalan. However, these plans have been met with controversy due to the probable effects on several traditional tribal villages. Plans to develop small and middle scale industries in Lawas have been proposed by the state government. At this time much of the land in Lawas, Sundar and Trusan has been transformed from padi fields into oil palm plantations. Lawas is also known as the producer of smoked fish called 'Tahai' in local dialect. One of the villages that produces 'Tahai' commercially is Kampung Awat-Awat in the Sundar sub-district.  Transport =Road Lawas, by virtue of its geographical location, is cut off from the rest of Sarawak's road network. It is however linked by main road to Sabah and Brunei's Temburong district. There is a good local road network around Lawas district which is relatively free of traffic jams. Travelling to or from Lawas by road requires undergoing immigration checks. Travelling to the rest of Sarawak requires a passport. Two road border crossings are located in Lawas district. *Mengkalap: Located to the west of Lawas town is the Mengkalap border checkpoint for traffic headed to or from Brunei. Immigration, Customs and Quarantine Complex is located here. Previously it was operating temporarily from a shoplot in Trusan Bazaar, 8 km from the actual Brunei-Malaysia border. The name of the Brunei checkpoint is Labu in Temburong district located at the border. *Merapok: Immigration guard posts are located here which borders with Sindumin checkpoint located in Sabah. In 2015, Merapok-Sindumin guard posts handled 700,000 visitors. File:MalaysiaExitMengkalap.jpgExit stamp from Mengkalap ICQS Checkpoint. File:MalaysiaEntryMerapok.jpgEntry stamp from Merapok ICQS Checkpoint. Water transport Another mode of transport is via the Lawas River. The cleaned river serves as an important link to neighbouring towns and deep interior settlements. Besides that, Lawas is also served by an airport. There has also been a plan to build a new airport. Commonly, four wheel drive would be the main transport for most of the highlanders. Brunei, Labuan and Limbang can be reached by boat. The journey will take around two hours to get to the destination. Boats to Brunei, Labuan and Limbang are available at Lawas Wharf every morning. The boats can accommodate around 150 passengers. Air transport Lawas is served by Lawas Airport (IATA: LWY). It has flights to Miri, Ba' Kelalan and Kota Kinabalu, Sabah. Public transport There is a local bus network as well as buses linking Lawas with Kota Kinabalu (Sabah), Miri (Sarawak) and Brunei.

The mall will houses a supermarket, departmental store and 132 commercial lots. Pasar Tamu Lawas The open-air market, locally known as tamu, is held weekly on from Friday evening until Saturday afternoon. Local produce such as fresh fruits, vegetables, fresh meat, Adan rice, Bario rice, Ikan Tahai, Hill salts (Garam Bakelalan), handycraft traditional and live poultry are sold. The days of this weekly community occasion differ from district to district. Activities *Pesta Lawas *Lawas Regatta *Irau Aco Lun Bawang Festival (Hari Gawai Dayak Harvest Festival) Places of interest One of the most popular tourist attractions in Lawas is its Tamu Lawas (or Lawas Produce Market), which is held every Saturday. Local products such as vegetables, fruits and sea products are sold by locals in this market which is frequented by locals and people from the neighbouring Temburong district of Brunei. Besides Tamu Lawas, other interesting places in Lawas are Punang Beach, Sungai Bangat Beach, Pa' Lelau in Merarap, Mount Murud, Kampung air Terjun (along Jalan Trusan). Kuala Lawas, Punang and Awat Awat are famous with its Kampung Air. It is similar to Kampung Ayer in Brunei but smaller. The main mode of transportation is perahu (boat) to cross the river.

The island is surrounded by many smaller ones including Eilean na Cloiche in the south east, Eilean an Fhèidh in the east, Flodaigh Mòr in the north east, Haunaray to the north, and Garbh Eilean Mòr between it and Grimsay. The north forms a peninsula called Rònaigh Beag, or little Ronay. The central section contains some seven or more lochs, which provide a freshwater supply. The entire island is rough, covered in outcrops and knolls, which may have been partly eroded by overgrazing.

In the north west, there is a headland (Rubha) and mountain (Beinn) of the priest (an t-sagairt), and a Rubha na Manach (monk's headland) in the south west. Martin Martin also mentions a chapel: :\\"in the Island Rona, called the Low-landers Chappel, because Seamen who dye in times of Fishing, are buried in that place.\\" This chapel was pre-Reformation. It is also possible that the island's name refers to St Ronan, as that of North Rona does. In the centre, there are several names related to \\"Druidhneach\\" (possibly druids), such as Loch nan Druidhneach. Such names often refer to neolithic remains. Other historical references occur in the island's names, such as Bàgh Clann Neill in the west, Rubha Creag Mhic Fhionnlaigh and Bàgh na h-Eireannach in the north. In 1826, there were 180 living on the island, but in 1831, the whole population was cleared to make way for sheep farming. See Highland Clearances. However, by 1841, 9 people were recorded, who may have moved back. The island was abandoned for good in 1931.

Earlier, it was the centre of Torgay Region, which was abolished in 1997. Today, it is the administrative centre of Torgay District, Kostanay Region. Established in 1956, it acquired the status of the city in 1965. The distance from the town of Arkalyk to Kostanay is , to Nur-Sultan is . Population: The Arkalyk Business Centre describes today's Arkalyk as \\"a city of miners, of regional administrators, and people excited to live in a regional center\\". Historically Arkalyk was a centre for the Soviet space programme. Cosmonauts would land on the huge central Kazakh steppe and come back to Arkalyk before heading to the Baikonur, the Soviet Union's premier \\"space city\\". Arkalyk is served by Arkalyk Airport. The city is linked by rail communication with the regional center (terminal station on a branch Esil - Derzhavinsk - Arkalyk). Roads Kostanay - Arkalyk tarmac, but is severely broken in the state. Roads Zhezkazgan - Arkalyk ground, in the wet weather becomes difficult even for freight transport because of mud. There is an airport (located 6 kilometers north-east of the city), capable of class aircraft Tu-154, Tu-134, etc. In Soviet times, it carried out flights to many cities in Kazakhstan, but since the mid-1990s an airport has been practically abandoned and used only sporadically during the search and rescue for the planting of manned spaceaids. History Arkalyk was founded in 1956 as a settlement of geologists and builders. By birth, it was obliged to open after the war for deposits of bauxite (raw material for aluminum production). On May 17, 1956, in a joint decree of the CPSU Central Committee and USSR Council of Ministers a separate line was written: «On the basis of Amangeldy bauxite deposits construct and put into operation Torghay bauxite mines ». In the 1960s Arkalyk was declared the All-Union shock Komsomol building, there was the young people flock from all over the USSR. In 1965 Arkalyk received city status and in 1971 became the center of the newly created Torghay area. In the 1980s the city reached its peak: it produced meat, poultry, and dairy. It functioned grain elevator, ceramic factory, sewing factory, the factory radio, factory built Aviamotornaya, Turgay bauxite mine (TBRU), which extracted up to 20% of bauxite ores in the USSR. But despite the industrial production, the economy of Torgay Region was behind other regions of Kazakhstan due to large agricultural sector which was 90%. The region constantly demanded subsidies from the national budget, so in June 1988 it was dissolved and its territory was divided between Kostanai and Aqmola areas. When the city stopped to be a regional center, some parts of the infrastructure was evacuated (for example, regional radio station), and a number of potential industrial sites was frozen. In 1989, active inhabitants of Arkalyk organized committee to restore Torgay Region. In August 1990, Torgay Region was re-established, and Arkalyk become the regional center again. Degradation of the city began in 1993-1994: production fell into decay. Migration began to other regions of Kazakhstan, Russia and Germany. Consequently, population of the city reduced. In 1991 it was 65,000 people, in 1999 it was 45,000, now it is 23,000 people. During 90s there were disrupted public services such as lengthy interruption of electricity, heat and water. In 1997, Turgay area has been disbanded again, and its territory was again moved into Kostanai and Akmola areas. Some of the city districts as a part of #6, all of #7 and #9 were completely abandoned by the 2000s. Migration from the city was a complicated process which started in 90s. Full optimization stopped in 2000–2001. Enterprising businessmen from other regions of Kazakhstan dismantled the houses by removing building materials. At the turn of 20th and 21st century, local authorities organized a campaign to relocate the remaining residents from the abandoned districts to the older city center, so the cost for municipal services would be reduced and communication would be significantly improved. Currently, the city of Arkalyk is included in the list of depressed cities of Kazakhstan due to a very high level of unemployment. Industry in the city is virtually non-existent, except for maintaining the life of city and Torgayskogo bauxite mine, which is housed in SC «Aluminum of Kazakhstan». All produced bauxiteore is sent to the aluminum plant in Pavlodar, and other regions. Establishment of an aluminum smelter in Arkalyk is difficult due to lack of water. Prospectives of Arkalyk are dual. On the one hand, the town has the bauxite mine which over the next 15–20 years will exhaust deposits and it will be possible to extract refractory clay only. On the other hand, there are a number of other minerals such as Jean-Arkalykskoe field has the shallow bed (up to 50 meters); Akzhalskoe field nefritoidov has the jewelry and raw materials; Akbulakskoe field has white marble; Agyrzhalskoe field has black marble; Jean-Arkalykskoe has deposits of therapeutic mineral waters. Development of these fields could lead to the economic and social revival of the region. Climate In Arkalyk, the climate is cold and temperate. There is more rainfall in winter than in summer. The Köppen-Geiger climate classification is Dfa. The average annual temperature in Arkalyk is . About of precipitation falls annually.

It can either be a standalone touchscreen computer used independently to perform tasks and operations, or a connectable apparatus used as a touchpad to control computers from a projector. They are used in a variety of settings, including classrooms at all levels of education, in corporate board rooms and work groups, in training rooms for professional sports coaching, in broadcasting studios, and others. The first interactive whiteboards were designed and manufactured for use in the office. They were developed by PARC around 1990. This board was used in small group meetings and round-tables. The interactive whiteboard industry was expected to reach sales of US$1 billion worldwide by 2008; one of every seven classrooms in the world was expected to feature an interactive whiteboard by 2011 according to market research by Futuresource Consulting. In 2004, 26% of British primary classrooms had interactive whiteboards. The Becta Harnessing Technology Schools Survey 2007 indicated that 98% of secondary and 100% of primary schools had IWBs. By 2008, the average numbers of interactive whiteboards rose in both primary schools (18 compared with just over six in 2005, and eight in the 2007 survey) and secondary schools (38, compared with 18 in 2005 and 22 in 2007). General operation and use An interactive whiteboard (IWB) device can either be a standalone computer or a large, functioning touchpad for computers to use. A device driver is usually installed on the attached computer so that the interactive whiteboard can act as a Human Input Device (HID), like a mouse. The computer's video output is connected to a digital projector so that images may be projected on the interactive whiteboard surface. The user then calibrates the whiteboard image by matching the position of the projected image in reference to the whiteboard using a pointer as necessary. After this, the pointer or other device may be used to activate programs, buttons and menus from the whiteboard itself, just as one would ordinarily do with a mouse. If text input is required, user can invoke an on-screen keyboard or, if the whiteboard software provides for this, utilize handwriting recognition. This makes it unnecessary to go to the computer keyboard to enter text. Thus, an IWB emulates both a mouse and a keyboard. The user can conduct a presentation or a class almost exclusively from the whiteboard. In addition, most IWBs are supplied with software that provides tools and features specifically designed to maximize interaction opportunities. These generally include the ability to create virtual versions of paper flipcharts, pen and highlighter options, and possibly even virtual rulers, protractors, and compasses—instruments that would be used in traditional classroom teaching. Uses for interactive whiteboards may include: * Running software that is loaded onto the connected PC, such as a web browsers or other software used in the classroom. * Capturing and saving notes written on a whiteboard to the connected PC * Capturing notes written on a graphics tablet connected to the whiteboard * Controlling the PC from the white board using click and drag, markup which annotates a program or presentation * Using OCR software to translate cursive writing on a graphics tablet into text * Using an Audience Response System so that presenters can poll a classroom audience or conduct quizzes, capturing feedback onto the whiteboard Common types of operation The majority of IWBs sold globally involve one of four forms of interaction between the user and the content projected on the whiteboard. These are an infrared scan technology; a resistive, touch-based board; an electromagnetic pen and associated software; and an ultrasonic pen. Operation of an infrared scan (IR touch) whiteboard An infrared interactive whiteboard is a large interactive display that connects to a computer and projector. The board is typically mounted to a wall or floor stand. Movement of the user's finger, pen, or other pointer over the image projected on the whiteboard is captured by its interference with infrared light at the surface of the whiteboard. When the whiteboard surface is pressed, software triangulates the location of the marker or stylus. Infrared IWBs may be made of any material, no dry-erase markers are involved, and may be found in many settings, including various levels of classroom education, corporate boardrooms, training or activity rooms for organizations, professional sports coaching facilities, and broadcasting studios. Operation of a resistive touch-based interactive whiteboard A touch-based IWB also involves a simple pointing device. In this case, the material of the board is important. In the most common resistive system, a membrane stretched over the surface deforms under pressure to make contact with a conducting backplate. The touch point location can then be determined electronically and registered as a mouse event. For example, when a finger is pressed on the surface, it is registered as the equivalent of the left mouse click. Again, such a board requires no special instruments. This leads to the claim of resistive systems manufacturers that such a whiteboard is easy and natural to use. It is, however, heavily dependent on the construction of the board itself. Operation of an electromagnetic pen- based interactive whiteboard An electromagnetic pen-based interactive whiteboard involves an array of wires embedded behind the solid board surface that interacts with a coil in the stylus tip to determine the horizontal and vertical coordinates of the stylus. The pen itself usually is passive, i.e., it contains no batteries or other power source; it alters the electrical signals produced by the board. For instance, when close to the surface of the board, the mouse pointer can be sensed, giving the board \\"mouse-over\\" capabilities. When it is pressed in against the board in one way, the board activates a switch in the pen to signal a mouse click to the computer; pressed in another way, contact with the board signals a click of the right mouse- button. Like a scaled-up version of a graphics tablet used by professional digital artists and designers, an electromagnetic IWB can emulate mouse actions accurately, will not malfunction if a user leans on the board, and can potentially handle multiple inputs. Operation of a portable ultrasonic, IR pen-based interactive whiteboard This technology uses infrared light and ultrasound positioning technology. The technology works in a similar way to lightning in a thunderstorm by computing the time difference between the speed of light and the speed of sound. An infrared IWB is also available in a portable format. After moving the set-up to a new location, the system acquires connection to the computer with a simple re-calibration of the projected image — again using the electronic pen. The device or bar scans a bracketed area (usually 3m by 1.5m, giving a whiteboard that is 110\\" wide). Typically, multiple brackets can be added, providing for users at different sites to share the same virtual whiteboard. A portable IR pen-based whiteboard works on a variety of surfaces — an existing whiteboard, a flat wall, even a chalkboard with dry-erase paint, transforms those surface into an interactive whiteboard. No battery is required for USB signal receiver and the unit can be mounted to the ceiling if a permanent solution is required. Made of a tiny and lightweight material, the PIWB is easy to transport. Operation of a Wiimote / IR-based interactive whiteboard A Wii-based IR system was invented by Johnny Chung Lee, PhD. in 2007. Lee claimed that the system \\"[m]akes a technology available to a much wider percentage of the population\\" (Speaking at TED, April 2008) by using an ordinary Wii remote control as a pointer and the IR camera on the front of the remote control as tracking device sensing light from an IR light pen. Lee produced several videos on YouTube about this system to demonstrate its operability, flexibility, and ease of use, and pointing out its modest price — the most inexpensive part is the infrared LED of the pen. This is an approach with a shallow learning curve since the gaming system is already familiar to many. A large programming support community may be available, both in opensource and commercial offerings.) However, the system cannot be used near direct sunlight, nor can it share the software of manufacturers of the IWB- types already mentioned. Certain considerations about the Bluetooth connection of the light pen also apply. Two lines of sight are involved (the controller and the pen) in the case of rear-projection case. unlike many others.) Operation of a virtual whiteboard via an interactive projector An interactive projector IWB involves a CMOS camera built into the projector, so that the projector produces the IWB image, but also detects the position of an active IR light pen when it contacts the surface where the image is projected. This solution, developed in 2007 and patented in 2010 by U.S. manufacturer Boxlight, like the other IR whiteboard systems, can suffer from potential problems caused by 'line of sight' between the pen and the projector/receiver and, like them also, does not provide mouse-over capability found in other solutions. Classroom uses In some classrooms, interactive whiteboards have replaced traditional whiteboards or flipcharts, or video/media systems such as a DVD player and TV combination. Even where traditional boards are used, the IWB often supplements them by connecting to a school network digital video distribution system. In other cases, IWBs interact with online shared annotation and drawing environments such as interactive vector based graphical websites. Brief instructional blocks can be recorded for review by students — they will see the exact presentation that occurred in the classroom with the teacher's audio input. This can help transform learning and instruction. Many companies and projects now focus on creating supplemental instructional materials specifically designed for interactive whiteboards. Electrokite out of Boston, MA, for example, will have the first complete curriculum for schools and districts. One recent use of the IWB is in shared reading lessons. Mimic books, for instance, allow teachers to project children's books onto the interactive whiteboard with book-like interactivity. Dixons City Academy in the North of England was the first non-college or university learning environment to make use of interactive whiteboards after the school's then principal Sir John Lewis showed a keen interest in the developing technology. An interactive whiteboard can now be found in every classroom of the school. Integration with a learner response system Some manufacturers also provide classroom response systems as an integrated part of their interactive whiteboard products. Handheld 'clickers' operating via Infrared or Radio signals, for example, offer basic multiple choice and polling options. More sophisticated clickers offer text and numeric responses and can export an analysis of student performance for subsequent review. By combining classroom response with an interactive whiteboard system, teachers can present material and receive feedback from students in order to direct instruction more effectively or else to carry out formal assessments. For example, a student may both solve a puzzle involving math concepts on the interactive whiteboard and later demonstrate his or her knowledge on a test delivered via the classroom response system. Some classroom response software can organize and develop activities and tests aligned with State standards. Research into impact of interactive whiteboards on education standards There are now several studies revealing contradictory conclusions about the effect of the use of IWBs is effective on student learning. A compilation of this research is available. London Challenge Study According to the findings of a study conducted by the London Institute of Education with the funding of the DfES evaluated the educational and operational effectiveness of the London Challenge element of the adoption of the use of interactive whiteboards in the London area under a program called \\"the Schools Whiteboard Expansion project.\\" At Key Stage 3, interactive whiteboards here associated with little significant impact on student performance in Mathematics and English and only a slight improvement in Science. In the same schools, at Key Stage 4, use of interactive whiteboards was found to have negative effects for Mathematics and Science, but positive effects for English. The authors cite several possible causes for the Key Stage 4 findings, including: a Type II statistical error, disruption to teaching methods leading to reduced pupil performance when IWBs were installed, or a non-random deployment decision of IWB installation resulting in a skew of the data. The DfES Primary Schools Whiteboard Expansion project At the same time, there is evidence of improved performance gains with the use of interactive whiteboards. The BECTA (UK) commissioned a study into the impact of Interactive Whiteboards over a two- year period. This study showed a very significant learning gains, particularly with second cohorts of students, where they benefited from the teacher's experience with the device. Between 2003 and 2004, The DfES Primary Schools Whiteboard Expansion project (PSWE) provided substantial funding to 21 local authorities for the acquisition and use of interactive whiteboards in UK primary schools. The BECTA-sponsored study investigated the impact of this investment with 20 local authorities, using data for 7272 learners in 97 schools. Variables considered in the research included length of exposure to interactive whiteboard technology, the age of pupils (down to individual birthdays), gender, special needs, entitlement to free schools meals and other socio-economic groupings. The implementation and impacts of the project were evaluated by a team at Manchester Metropolitan University, led by Professor Bridget Somekh. To date it is the largest and longest study conducted into the impact of interactive whiteboards. =Key findings= The principal finding of this large-scale study was that, \\"[w]hen teachers have used an interactive whiteboard for a considerable period of time (by the autumn of 2006 for at least two years) its use becomes embedded in their pedagogy as a mediating artefact for their interactions with their pupils, and pupils' interactions with one another.\\" The authors of the study argued that \\"mediating interactivity\\" is a sound concept, offering \\"a ... theoretical explanation for the way in which the multi-level modelling (MLM) analyses link the length of time pupils have been taught with interactive whiteboards to greater progress in national test scores year on year.\\"'' The research showed that interactive whiteboard technology led to consistent gains across all key stages and subjects with increasingly significant impact on the second cohorts, indicating that embedding of the technology into the classroom and teacher experience with the technology are key factors. Gains were measured in 'months progress' against standard measures of attainment over the two-year study period. In infant classes, ages 5–7: * In Key Stage 1 Maths, high attaining girls made gains of 4.75 months over the two years, enabling them to catch up with high attaining boys. * In Key Stage 1 Science, there was improved progress for girls of all attainment levels and for average and high attaining boys. * In Key Stage 1 English, average and high attending pupils all benefited from increased exposure to interactive whiteboards There was also clear evidence of similar impacts in Key stage two – ages 7 – 11 * In Key Stage 2 Maths, average and high attaining boys and girls who had been taught extensively with the Interactive Whiteboard made the equivalent of an extra 2.5 to 5 months progress over the course of the two years. * In Key Stage 2 Science, all pupils, except high attaining girls made greater progress with more exposure to the IWB, with low attaining boys making as much as 7.5 months additional progress * In Key Stage 2 writing, boys with low attainment made 2.5 months of additional progress. There was no adverse impact observed at any level. Additional research Glover & Miller conducted a study on the pedagogic impact of interactive whiteboards in a secondary school. They found that although interactive whiteboards are theoretically more than a computer if it is only being used as an adjunct to teaching its potential remains unrealized. The authors' research was primarily to ascertain the extent and type of use in the classroom. In order to determine if any change in pedagogy or teaching strategies was taking place the researchers conducted a detailed questionnaire. The authors found that the teachers used the IWBs in one of three ways; as an aid to efficiency, as an extension device, and as a transformative device. They noted that teachers' use of the technology was not primarily affected by training, access, or software availability. When used as a transformative device (approximately 10% of teachers taking part in the study) the impact on pedagogy was transformative. In recent times, manufacturers of IWB technology have been setting up various online support communities for teachers and educational institutions deploying the use of the interactive whiteboards in learning environments. Such websites regularly contribute research findings and administer free whiteboard lessons to promote widespread use of interactive whiteboards in classrooms. Benefits Some of the benefits of using interactive whiteboards include: *Group interaction. Interactive whiteboards promotes collaboration among students and group discussion and participation. They can be an effective tool for brainstorming due to the fact that notes can be taken on the board and saved to be shared and distributed to students later. Criticisms According to a 11 June 2010 Washington Post article: * Many academics question industry-backed studies linking improved test scores to their products. And some go further. They argue that the most ubiquitous device-of-the-future, the interactive whiteboard - essentially a giant interactive computer screen that is usurping blackboards in classrooms across America - locks teachers into a 19th-century lecture style of instruction counter to the more collaborative small-group models that many reformers favor. The same article also quotes Larry Cuban, education professor emeritus at Stanford University: * There is hardly any research that will show clearly that any interactive whiteboards will improve academic achievement. An article posted on the National Association of Secondary School Principals web site details pros & cons of interactive whiteboards. A report on interactive whiteboards from London's Institute of Education said: * Although the newness of the technology was initially welcomed by pupils any boost in motivation seems short-lived. Statistical analysis showed no impact on pupil performance in the first year in which departments were fully equipped. The report highlighted the following issues: * Sometimes teachers focused more on the new technology than on what pupils should be learning. * The focus on interactivity as a technical process can lead to some relatively mundane activities being over-valued. Such an emphasis on interactivity was particularly prevalent in classes with lower-ability students. * In lower-ability groups it could actually slow the pace of whole class learning as individual pupils took turns at the board. Academic literature reviews and research There are a number of literature reviews, findings and papers on the use of interactive whiteboards in the classroom: * McCrummen, S. \\"Some educators question if whiteboards, other high-tech tools raise achievement.\\" * Beauchamp, G., & Parkinson, J.

Technologies Interactive whiteboards may use one of several types of sensing technology to track interaction on the screen surface: resistive, electromagnetic, infrared optical, laser, ultra-sonic, and camera-based (optical). * Resistive – Resistive touchscreens are composed of two flexible sheets coated with a resistive material and separated by a microthin air gap. When contact is made to the surface of the touchscreen, the two sheets are pressed together, registering the precise location of the touch. This technology allows one to use a finger, a stylus, or any other pointing device on the surface of the board. * Active Electromagnetic Board – These interactive whiteboards feature an array of wires embedded behind the board surface interacts with a coil in the stylus tip to determine the (X,Y) coordinate of the stylus. Styli are either active (require a battery or wire back to the whiteboard) or passive (alter electrical signals produced by the board, but contain no batteries or other power source). In other words, there are magnetic sensors in the board that react and send a message back to the computer when they are activated by a magnetic pen. * Passive Electromagnetic Board - In contrast to an active electromagnetic board this one does not contain the sensing technology in the board itself, but in the pen. Tiny magnetic fibers are embedded in the whiteboard and form a pattern that an electromagnetic coil in the pen is able to sense. Therefore, the pen is able to calculate its location on the whiteboard and sends this information to a computer. *Capacitive – Just like the electromagnetic type, the capacitive type works with an array of wires behind the board. In this case however the wires interact with fingers touching the screen. The interaction between the different wires (laminated in a patented X- and Y-axis manner) and the tip of the finger is measured and calculated to a (x, y) coordinate. Other types include Projected Capacitive, which uses an Indium Tin Oxide (ITO)http://multimedia.3m.com/mws/media/788463O/tech-brief-projected- capacitive-technology.pdf?fn=Projected%20Capacitive%20Technology grid sandwiched between clear film and the newest type using Transparent Electrodes replacing the ITO. * Optical: # Infrared light curtain – When pressed to the whiteboard surface, the finger or marker sees the infrared light. Software then manipulates the information to triangulate the location of the marker or stylus. This technology allows whiteboards to be made of any material; with this system no dry-erase marker or stylus is needed. # Laser light curtain – An infrared laser is located in each upper corner of the whiteboard. The laser beam sweeps across the whiteboard surface—much like a lighthouse sweeps light across the ocean—by using a rotating mirror. Reflectors on the stylus or marker reflect the laser beam back to the source and the (X,Y) position can be triangulated. This technology may be combined with a hard (usually ceramic on steel) surface, which has long life and erases cleanly. Markers and styli are passive, but must have reflective tape to work. # Projector/Laser light curtain – A dual infrared laser device is positioned in the top middle area of a flat surface. The laser beam sweeps across the surface creating an invisible curtain. The projector, usually an ultra short throw projector) has a built in camera with an infrared filter that scans the projected area. When a pointer, finger or marker disrupts the laser curtain, an X,Y position can be traced. This is one of the few optical technologies that do not require a reflecting frame in the perimeter of the projected area to work. # Frustrated total internal reflection – Infrared light bounces within a flexible and transparent surface. When the surface is deformed through a finger press the internal reflection is disrupted and the light escapes the surface where it is then sensed by cameras. Image processing software turns the light spots observed by the cameras into mouse or pointer movements. # Camera Pen and Dot Pattern – These interactive whiteboards have a microscopic dot pattern embedded in the writing surface. A wireless digital pen contains an infrared camera that reads the dot pattern to determine the exact location on the board. The digital pen uses this pattern to store the handwriting and upload it to a computer. The accuracy is high since the coordinates are usually fixed at about 600 dots per inch. With the electronics in the pen, the whiteboard is passive (containing no electronics or wiring). This is licensed as Anoto technology. # Wii Remote IWB – A Wii Remote is connected to a computer through its Bluetooth connection capabilities. Using open-source software and an IR-Pen (a pen made with a momentary switch, power source and an Infrared Led) any surface (desk/floor/wall/whiteboard/LCD) can be turned into an Interactive Whiteboard. Being more portable and typically more affordable, BoardShare is a completely portable these may also require a laptop and projector*. The Wii Remote has a very accurate Infrared Light tracking camera. Once calibrated, the Wii Remote detects a mouse click at the screen location of the IR-Pen. The Wii remote was first adapted for use as an interactive whiteboard by Johnny Chung Lee. *DST [Dispersive Signal Technology] A touch causes vibrations which create a bending wave through the substrate, which is detected by corner-mounted sensors. Using advanced digital signal processing and proprietary algorithms, an accurate touch location is identified. A touch is activated by a finger or stylus touching the glass substrate and creating a vibration. The vibration radiates a bending wave through the substrate, from the point of contact and spreading out to the edges. Sensors in the corners convert the vibrational energy into electrical signals. Through advanced Digital Signal Processing, we are able to apply dispersion correction algorithms which analyze the signals and report an accurate touch. * Ultrasonic: # Ultrasonic only – These devices have two ultrasonic transmitters in two corners and two receivers in the other two corners. The ultrasonic waves are transmitted by the whiteboard surface. Some little marks in the whiteboard borders create reflecting waves for each ultrasonic transmitter at different and recognizable distances. Touching with a pen or even the finger in the whiteboard causes these point waves to be suppressed, and the receivers communicate the fact to the controller. # Hybrid Ultrasound and Infrared – When pressed to the whiteboard surface, the marker or stylus sends out both an ultrasonic sound and an infrared light. Two ultrasonic microphones receive the sound and measure the difference in the sound's arrival time, and triangulate the location of the marker or stylus. This technology allows whiteboards to be made of any material, but requires a suitably adapted active dry-erase marker or stylus. Potential issues Permanent markers and use of regular dry erase markers can create problems on some interactive whiteboard surfaces because interactive whiteboard surfaces are most often melamine, which is a porous, painted surface that can absorb marker ink. Punctures, dents and other damage to surfaces are also a risk. Some educators have found that the use of interactive whiteboards reinforces an age-old teaching method: the teacher speaks, and students listen. This teaching model is contrary to many modern instructional models. Front and rear projection Interactive whiteboards are generally available in two forms: front projection and rear projection. *Front-projection interactive whiteboards have a video projector in front of the whiteboard. A disadvantage of front-projection whiteboards is that the presenter, standing in front of the screen, must extend his or her arm with or without a stylus to avoid casting a shadow. This is not a disadvantage of Ultra-Short-Throw (UST) projectors, which cast an image from above and just in front of the IWB surface, removing the presenter from the beam's path. *Rear-projection interactive whiteboards locate the projector or emissive display behind the whiteboard sensing surface so that no shadows occur. This also avoids the problem with front-projection boards that the presenter has to look into the projector light while speaking to the audience. However, rear-projection systems are generally significantly more expensive than front-projection boards, are often very large, and cannot be mounted flush on a wall, although in-wall installations are possible. Some manufacturers also provide an option to raise and lower the display to accommodate users of different heights. Short-throw projection systems and interactive whiteboards Some manufacturers offer short-throw projection systems in which a projector with a special wide angle lens is mounted much closer to the interactive whiteboard surface and projects down at an angle of around 45 degrees. These vastly reduce the shadow effects of traditional front-projection systems and eliminate any chance for a user to see the projector beam. The risk of projector theft, which is problematic for some school districts, is reduced by integrating the projector with the interactive whiteboard. Some manufacturers have provided a unified system where the whiteboards, short throw projection system and audio system are all combined into a single unit which can be set at different heights and enable young children and those in wheelchairs to access all areas of the board. Reduced installation costs make these short- throw projection systems cost effective. Calibration In most cases, the touch surface must be initially calibrated with the display image. This process involves displaying a sequence of dots or crosses on the touch surface and having the user select these dots either with a stylus or their finger. This process is called alignment, calibration, or orientation. Fixed installations with projectors and boards bolted to roof and wall greatly reduce or eliminate the need to calibrate. A few interactive whiteboards can automatically detect projected images during a different type of calibration. The technology was developed by Mitsubishi Electric Research Laboratories Inc and is disclosed in patent 7,001,023. The computer projects a Gray Code sequence of white and black bars on the touch surface and light sensitive sensors behind the touch surface detect the light passing through the touch surface. This sequence allows the computer to align the touch surface with the display; however, it has the disadvantage of having tiny fiber-sized \\"dead spots\\" in the resistive touch surface where the light sensors are present. The \\"dead spots\\" are so small that touches in that area are still presented to the computer properly. Another system involves having a light sensor built into the projector and facing the screen. As the projector generates its calibration image (a process called \\"training\\"), it detects the change in light reflected from the black border and the white surface. In this manner it can uniquely compute all the linear matrix transform coefficients. Yet another system includes a camera built into the handheld pen, with human imperceptible targets injected into the image stream sent to the projector or display, containing positioning information, where the camera detects that information and calculates position accordingly, requiring no calibration at all. Such a technology and system is integrated into penveu, and is further disclosed in patent 8,217,997 Associated equipment A variety of accessories is available for interactive whiteboards: * Mobile stand – Allows the interactive whiteboard to be moved between rooms. Many are height adjustable as well. * Personal Response System – Allows students to answer test questions posted on the whiteboard or take part in polls and surveys. * Printer – Allows copies of the whiteboard notes to be made. * Remote control – Allows the presenter to control the board from different parts of the room and eliminates on-screen toolbars. * Slate or tablet – Allows students control of the whiteboard away from the front of the room. * Track – Allows the whiteboard to be placed over a traditional whiteboard or tackboard to provide additional wall space at the front of the room. Some tracks provide power and data to the whiteboard as well. * Video projector – Allows a computer display to be projected onto the whiteboard. 'Short Throw' projectors are available from some manufacturers that mount directly above the board minimizing shadow effects. 'Ultra Short Throw' projectors are even more effective. * Wireless unit – Allows the interactive whiteboard to operate without wires to the computer, e.g. Bluetooth.

It is a north-south route north of Sierra Vista, and an east- west route east of the city. It passes through the San Pedro Riparian National Conservation Area at milepost 329; the riparian area makes up a large part of the southern section of the San Pedro Valley. Route description The northern terminus of SR 90 is located at an interchange with I-10 west in Benson. It heads south from the interchange and provides access to Kartchner Caverns State Park. It continues south from the state park to a junction with SR 82 north of Huachuca City. It continues towards the south, but curves towards the southeast before passing through Huachuca City. SR 90 continues to the southeast passing through the Fort Huachuca Military Reservation and passes near the Sierra Vista Municipal Airport. The highway turns towards the east as it enters Sierra Vista. It continues to the east along the north side of the city before curving towards the south to a junction with SR 92. As SR 92 continues south from the junction, SR 90 turns towards the east. It continues to the east until curving towards the southeast near the overpass over the San Pedro & South Western Railroad line. The highway continues to the southeast to its eastern terminus at a junction with SR 80 between Tombstone and Bisbee. History The highway was designated in 1936, but constructed in the 1940s, and originally covered the route from Sierra Vista to US 80 near Bisbee. In 1961, the road was extended north, overtaking State Route 92's path to Whetstone and continuing north to Benson, providing easier access to Sierra Vista and Fort Huachuca from the north. This segment was widened to four lanes in the 1990s. Junction listSpur Route SR 90 has a spur route, logged as two separate sections and located entirely within the city of Sierra Vista. Both sections of the spur are less than and are located near Fort Huachuca. East leg State Spur Route 90 (1) (SR 90 Spur) is a long spur route of SR 90\\\\. The route begins immediately south of SR 90 on Buffalo Soldier Trail. The spur travels north along Buffalo Soldier Trail to a traffic light with SR 90 and the second SR 90 Spur. The second spur begins at the western end of the intersection. The remainder of Buffalo Soldier trail acts as the western edge of Sierra Vista. The road also provides a direct connection to SR 92 and can be used as a bypass of downtown Sierra Vista by SR 90 traffic headed to SR 92\\\\. All of SR 90 Spur is unsigned. West leg State Spur Route 90 (2) (SR 90 Spur) is a long spur route of SR 90\\\\. The route starts close to a checkpoint at the eastern gate of Fort Huachuca.

Tullio Arena) is a multi-purpose indoor arena in the downtown area of Erie, Pennsylvania. It is home to the Erie Otters of the Ontario Hockey League and the Erie BayHawks of the NBA G League. It was built in 1983 as part of the Louis J. Tullio Plaza, which also includes the Warner Theatre and UPMC Park - all of which are administered by the Erie County Convention Center Authority. The arena is named for the Erie Insurance Group, which purchased the naming rights in May 2012. History Erie Insurance Arena was built for $9.3 million in 1983. It opened in June 1983 with a Beach Boys concert. Since then, it has hosted entertainers including Elton John, Rod Stewart, Cher, KISS, Barry Manilow, Alan Jackson, Trans-Siberian Orchestra, and Alice Cooper. Erie Insurance Arena has also featured Disney on Ice, World Wrestling Entertainment, Total Nonstop Action Wrestling, the Harlem Globetrotters, and Ringling Bros. and Barnum & Bailey Circus. In May 2012, the Erie County Convention Center Authority and the Erie Insurance Group announced a 10-year, $3 million naming agreement that would rename the former Louis J. Tullio Arena, \\"Erie Insurance Arena.\\" This renaming coincided with the completion of the current $42 million renovation project that was completed in September 2013. The renovation, designed by Friday/Sink Combs Dethlefs Joint Venture Architects, modernized the arena and added some new sections and a landscaped park entrance. Construction on the project was carried out by the Pittsburgh- based Turner Construction Company. Improvements included additional seating and concourses. To accommodate this, its footprint expanded from the original to . This increased the venue's capacity to 6,833 for hockey, 6,754 for basketball and about 9,000 for concerts. Erie Insurance Arena now has enlarged lobbies, more box office windows, luxury suites, administrative offices, mechanical rooms, training areas, new locker rooms, and a club level sponsored by the Erie Times-News. Funding for the renovations derived from $32 million pledged by former Pennsylvania governor Ed Rendell, combined with $10 million paid by Erie County. The arena has hosted numerous high school and college basketball games. Two of the most notable basketball games were between Cathedral Preparatory School and McDowell and local colleges, Gannon University and Mercyhurst University. Both games featured rival schools. Both games generated the most attended high school and college basketball games in city history, both selling out at 5,500. In September 2014, the Erie County Convention Center Authority completed a $1.4 million upgrade to the arena which had been dropped from the previous renovation due to a tightened budget. This upgrade included a closed-circuit video system, high-definition video panels on the east and west ends of the arena, and a high-definition \\"center ice\\" video scoreboard.

The volcano is of the cinder cone (or scoria-cone) type, and is on the northeast corner of the Thadra table mountain in the al Jaww basin, an erosional divide between Harrat ar-Rahah and Harrat al 'Uwayrid. Its eruption history is currently unknown, but geological studies have shown that Hallat al Badr erupted some time during the Holocene period, and the most recent lava flows were in the al Jaww basin.G. F. Brown, D. L. Schmidt, A. C. Huffman Jr., “Geology of the Arabian Peninsula: Shield Area of Western Saudi Arabia,” U.S. Geological Survey 560-‐A [Part 1] (1989): pp. 152-‐154.

Gunkel writes, \\"The characteristic Israelite narratives of Yahweh's appearance in the burning thorn bush (Exod. 3:2), in the burning and smoking Sinai (Exod. 19:9, 20:18; Deut. 4:11), and especially in the pillars of smoke and fire (Exod. 13:21)... can be explained originally from the fact that, in Israel's earliest belief, Yahweh was the god of the Sinai volcano.\\"Hermann Gunkel, Genesis (trans. M.E. Biddle; Macon, GA: Mercer University Press, 1997), p. 181. This possibility would exclude all the peaks on the Sinai Peninsula and Mount Seir, but would match a number of places in northwestern Saudi Arabia, of which Hala-'l Badr is the most prominent. Beke renounced his theory that Sinai was a volcano when he learned that Mount Baghir (also \\"Mountain of Light\\"), his volcanic Mount Sinai which was just northeast of the Gulf of Aqaba, was not a volcanic mountain after all.Charles Beke, The Late Dr. Charles Beke's Discoveries of Sinai in Arabia and of Midian (ed. Emily Beke London: Trübner, 1878), p. 436. In part, Humphreys' argument that Hallat al Badr is Mount Sinai rests on Alois Musils' argument that the itinerary stations given in Numbers 33 lead directly to Badr; he also reports that a volcano in the region erupted in 640 AD, but it is not known exactly which volcano this was. James K. Hoffmeier argues that the route suggested by Humphreys would have put the supposed volcano behind the Israelites at times, not in front. He also notes that the words for \\"cloud\\" and \\"pillar of cloud\\" appear frequently in Numbers - it covers the mountain, the temple built on top of the mountain, \\"it occupies the holy of holies in Solomon's temple\\" and \\"Numbers 12:5 specifically refers to God coming down in a pillar of cloud to denounce Miriam's charges against Moses after departing the mountain of God.\\" Thus \\"fire and cloud are understood to be vessels of theophany.\\" See also *Edomites Citations and notesExternal links * Google Maps satellite view * Graphs showing volcanic eruptions of the time, based on ice cores * Category:Volcanoes of Saudi Arabia ","title":"Hala-'l Badr"},{"id":"1890218","text":"Interior of USA Hockey Arena The USA Hockey Arena is a multi-purpose arena in Plymouth Township, Michigan, opened in 1996. Originally known as the Compuware Sports Arena, its name was shortened to Compuware Arena on September 11, 2007, to better market the venue for non-sporting events it hosted. It was renamed again to USA Hockey Arena in 2015 when the USA Hockey Foundation purchased the arena.http://www.usahockey.com/news_article/show/498327?referrer_id=1710470 History Peter Karmanos, the President of Compuware and owner of the Detroit Whalers, arranged to build the Whalers a new home as soon as the 1995–96 season ended after playing that season at Oak Park Ice Arena and The Palace of Auburn Hills. The Compuware Sports Arena was constructed in six months time, ready for the 1996–97 season. The team remained the Detroit Whalers after moving to Plymouth Township and then were renamed the Plymouth Whalers in 1997–98. The complex features two arenas: the main arena, where the Whalers played their home games, is standard NHL-size and has seating for roughly four thousand people; it also has a larger (in terms of ice area) Olympic-size ice surface, which has much more limited seating (800 seats) on only one side of the ice. The Olympic Arena is the home ice of Detroit Catholic Central High School although they occasionally play games in the main arena when strong attendance is anticipated. The two arenas share concession stands, both of which have openings for both arenas simultaneously, allowing one set of staff to serve both arenas simultaneously. Attached to the complex is \\"CJ's Brewing Companyhttp://www.cjsbreweryplymouth.com/\\". The arena was home to the now defunct Detroit Ignition, a Major Indoor Soccer League / XSL team, as well as the Compuware Ambassadors minor hockey program. Previously, the arena hosted the now defunct Detroit Rockers of the National Professional Soccer League during its last season in 2000-2001 The arena also hosts the annual MHSAA high school state championships for boys ice hockey. On October 22, 2006, TNA hosted Bound for Glory (2006) at the arena. During the summer months, the arena's parking lot is home to a drive-in movie theater that features double feature first run movies on three giant screens. It also hosts the commencement ceremonies for Adlai E. Stevenson High School (Livonia, Michigan), Northville High School, as well as for other high schools. In November 2014, it was reported that USA Hockey had reached an agreement to eventually take over Compuware Arena by mid-2015, with an intent to relocate the National Team Development Program from Ann Arbor to Plymouth, and use the facility to \\"host and showcase other USA Hockey programs and international events\\". The Plymouth Whalers were to remain a tenant, but were ultimately sold in January 2015 and re-located to Flint. In April 2017, USA Hockey Arena hosted the 2017 IIHF Women's World Championship.

She is a daughter of the Speaker of the United States House of Representatives Nancy Pelosi and Paul Pelosi.  Early life and education  Pelosi was born and raised in San Francisco, California. The youngest of five children, she earned a B.A. from Loyola Marymount University. In 1993, she received a master's degree from the USC Annenberg School for Communication and Journalism. Career Pelosi has produced 12 HBO documentary films with Sheila Nevins. In October 2020, Pelosi released American Selfie: One Nation Shoots Itself on Showtime. On The Daily Show, Pelosi talked about filming the National Guard's use of chemical agents at the protest outside the White House on June 1, 2020. Pelosi spent a decade as a field producer at NBC News. In 2000, while working as a producer for NBC covering George W. Bush's presidential campaign. She brought along a handheld camcorder documenting 18 months of her experience on the campaign trail; the footage was used to create Journeys with George, a documentary that earned her six Emmy nominations. In 2001, Sheila Nevins convinced Pelosi to leave network news to work exclusively for HBO. During the 2004 Democratic primaries, Pelosi returned to the campaign trail, this time following the Democratic candidates. Her HBO documentary, Diary of a Political Tourist, was accompanied by her first book Sneaking into the Flying Circus: How the Media Turn Our Presidential Campaigns into Freak Shows, about the process of selecting candidates for President of the United States. She stated that her conversations with Candy Crowley of CNN, Howard Dean, and Wesley Clark inspired her to write a book. In 2006, Pelosi created the documentary about evangelical Christians called Friends of God: A Road Trip with Alexandra Pelosi which featured former pastor Ted Haggard. After it aired on HBO in 2007, she made a follow-up film, The Trials of Ted Haggard, chronicling the exile of Ted Haggard from New Life Church after his sex and drug scandal, which The New York Times called \\"strangely intriguing\\". The LA Times review said, \\"this heartbreaking little film that may wind up being the most powerful indictment of homophobia since Brokeback Mountain.\\" Pelosi went back on the campaign trail in 2008 to document the birth of the Tea Party movement at Republican campaign events for her film, Right America: Feeling Wronged - Some Voices from the Campaign Trail, which premiered on HBO on President's Day 2009. CNN reported in July 2010 that Pelosi was no longer making political documentaries. Her 2010 HBO film, Homeless: The Motel Kids of Orange County follows the children of the working poor in Orange County, California. The New York Times praised the film for \\"advancing a theme of the failed American dream.\\" On July 4, 2011, HBO debuted Pelosi's next film Citizen U.S.A.: A 50 State Road Trip. Pelosi traveled to all 50 states to attend naturalization ceremonies and interviewed immigrants as they became legalized American citizens. The film was released with a coffee table book titled Citizen USA: A 50 State Road Trip. Pelosi was at the 2013 Sundance Film Festival with her film Fall to Grace, about disgraced former New Jersey governor Jim McGreevey. She was spotted around Park City with fellow headliner Kenneth Cole. In 2015, Pelosi returned to San Francisco to make a film about the tech boom's impact on the city. According to Recode, it's \\"a clear-eyed, sober recap of what's been going on...Pelosi's tale is also deeply personal; she grew up in San Francisco, but she has lived in New York for a long time. A key theme of the documentary is that the San Francisco to which she's returning is very different from the one she left.\\" Variety called San Francisco 2.0 \\"one of her finest.\\" San Francisco 2.0 was nominated for an Emmy for best business reporting. In 2016, Pelosi made Meet the Donors: Does Money Talk? about money's influence in politics. In a profile in Vogue, Pelosi calls her film a \\"light romp into the road map of the people and places that are funding our elections.\\" The film drops in on a handful of folks who rank on the OpenSecrets.org list of top donors. Uproxx described it as watching \\"Pelosi meet with an assortment of billionaire donors, asking them why they give millions to candidates, how this funding affects campaigns, and all the access these hefty donations can get you.\\" On the press tour for the film, Pelosi talked about everything she has learned in her lifetime on the political fundraising circuit The Words That Built America, Pelosi's eleventh film, premiered on July 4, 2017, narrated by Pulitzer Prize winning David McCullough, is a reading of the U.S. Constitution read by all the living presidents, vice presidents, 50 US senators of both parties, Supreme Court justices, and others. It includes a reading of the Declaration of Independence read by The Rock, Meryl Streep, Robert De Niro, Robert Redford, Sean Hannity, Kid Rock, and other celebrities. It closes with middle-school children from the United Nations International School reading the Bill of Rights and summaries of the other amendments. On Anderson Cooper 360, Anderson Cooper talked about hanging out with Pelosi's two sons on the set. According to The Port Arthur News, Pelosi was spotted in Port Arthur filming a new HBO documentary about Trump's America. Outside the Bubble: A Roadtrip with Alexandra Pelosi aired on HBO in October 2018. According to IMDB, \\"Pelosi sets out on a cross-country trip to engage in conversations with fellow Americans in an effort to gain an unfiltered understanding of other perspectives.\\" According to The New York Times,\\"It's not just another episode of the learned cosmopolitan descending from the ivory tower to produce anthropological discourses on that strange creature known as the Trump voter and make it back to the big city in time for a martini. Though she is Democratic royalty, Ms. Pelosi has spent much of her career dissecting, with compassion, the psyche of the political right in America.\\" In January 2019, Pelosi debuted \\"Goodbye Congress\\" on HBO's Vice News Tonight - the film that features exit interviews with 14 retiring members of Congress, including Speaker Paul Ryan and 7 other Republicans who explain how Washington works. Personal life On June 18, 2005, in Greenwich Village, she married Dutch journalist, lawyer, and United States correspondent Michiel Vos (born on December 19, 1970 in Groningen, the Netherlands).

It contains a small number of marine benthic worm-like species. The first known species (Xenoturbella bocki) was discovered in 1915 by Sixten Bock, but it was only properly described in 1949 by Einar Westblad. Description Xenoturbella bockii longitudinal section Xenoturbella has a very simple body plan. It consists of dorsoventrally flattened acoelomate animals, with an anterior circumferential furrow. It shows two ciliated epithelial layers: an external epidermis and an internal gastrodermis lining the simple sac-like gut. The multiciliated epiderm displays unique interconnected ciliary rootlets and mode of withdrawal and resorption of worn epidermal cells. The mouth is a mid-ventral pore leading to a gastral cavity, and there is no anus: waste is dispelled through the same opening as food is taken in. The nervous system is composed by a net of interconnected neurons beneath the epidermis, without any concentration of neurons forming ganglia or nerve cords. Species of Xenoturbella also lack a respiratory, circulatory and excretory system. In fact, there are no defined organs, except for an anterior statocyst containing flagellated cells and a frontal pore organ. There are no organized gonads, but gametes are produced. Adults producing sperm are very rarely observed, but eggs and embryos are known to occur in follicles. Eggs of Xenoturbella are wide, pale orange and opaque. Newly hatched embryos are free- swimming (tending to stay close to water surface) and ciliated. They feature no mouth and they do not apparently feed. They are similar to the juveniles of acoelomate Neochildia fusca.  Systematics = Etymology  The term Xenoturbella derives from the Ancient Greek word (), meaning \\"strange, unusual\\", and from the Latin word turbella meaning \\"stir, bustle\\". This refers to the enigmatic, unusual taxonomic status of the animal, initially considered as related to turbellarians, a group of flatworms whose aquatic species stir microscopic particles close to their ciliated epidermis.  Taxonomy  Currently the genus Xenoturbella contains 6 recognized species:WoRMS: Xenoturbella Westblad, 1949 * Xenoturbella bocki Westblad, 1949WoRMS: Xenoturbella bocki (Westblad, 1949) [Xenoturbella westbladi Israelsson, 1999http://www.marinespecies.org/aphia.php?p=taxdetails&id;=879660 AphiaID: 879660 has been DELETED - reason: Database artifact, incorrect authority - WoRMS]Xenoturbella westbladi Israelsson, 1999 - WoRMS] * Xenoturbella churro Rouse, Wilson, Carvajal & Vrijenhoek, 2016 * Xenoturbella hollandorum Rouse, Wilson, Carvajal & Vrijenhoek, 2016 * Xenoturbella japonica Nakano, 2017 * Xenoturbella monstrosa Rouse, Wilson, Carvajal & Vrijenhoek, 2016 * Xenoturbella profunda Rouse, Wilson, Carvajal & Vrijenhoek, 2016  Phylogeny = Among species  To date, the genus Xenoturbella is composed of six species distributed into a shallow-water clade — three species up to — and a deep-water clade — three species deeper than . The two smaller species, X. bocki and X. hollandorum, which are up to long, are found in shallower waters less than deep. They form a clade together with a third species, X. japonica, which is slightly over long and was found in waters less than deep. Three larger species, X. monstrosa, X. churro, and X. profunda, which were or greater long and lived in deeper waters , form another clade.  Among animals  The systematic and phylogenetic position of Xenoturbella among animals has been considered enigmatic since its discovery. An early DNA analysis suggested a close relationship to molluscs, but it was probably a result from contamination with DNA of molluscs that Xenoturbella consumes. A subsequent study suggested a placement of the genus in its own phylum, Xenoturbellida, as a deuterostome clade and sister group to the Ambulacraria. The deuterostome affiliations were then recovered by studies that indicate a basal position of this phylum within the deuterostomes or in a sister group relationship with the Ambulacraria. However, morphological characters, such as the structure of epidermal cilia, suggested a close relationship with Acoelomorpha, another problematic group. The study of the embryonic stages of Xenoturbella also showed that it is a direct developer without a feeding larval stage, and this developmental mode is similar to that of acoelomorphs. Molecular studies based on the concatenation of hundreds of proteins revealed indeed a monophyletic group composed by Xenoturbella and Acoelomorpha.Hejnol, A., Obst, M., Stamatakis, A., Ott, M., Rouse, G. W., Edgecombe, G. D., et al. (2009). Assessing the root of bilaterian animals with scalable phylogenomic methods. Proceedings of the Royal Society, Series B, 276, 4261–4270. This clade was named Xenacoelomorpha. The monophyly of Xenacoelomorpha soon became established, but its position as either a basal bilaterian clade or a deuterostome remained unresolved until 2016 when two new studies, with increased gene and taxon sampling, again placed Xenoturbella as the sister group of Acoelomorpha within Xenacoelomorpha, and placed Xenacoelomorpha as sister to Nephrozoa (Protostomia plus Deuterostomia), and therefore the basalmost bilaterian phylum.

Early life Born in Rome, Giuseppe was son of Luigi, a wine dealer with republican sympathies, and Elena Cortesia. He graduated at Liceo Torquato Tasso and attended the Sapienza University of Rome until the 1915, when Italy declared war to the Central Powers. The same year, he left his studies to enlist himself in the Italian Royal Army. Wounded in battle, he obtained a Medal of Military Valor after World War I. In 1919, Bottai met Benito Mussolini during a Futurist meeting and contributed to establish the Fasci Italiani di Combattimento (\\"Italian Fasces of Combat\\"). In 1921, Bottai ended his studies at law faculty and became a freemason, member of the Gran Loggia d'Italia. At the same time he also started a journalist career in the Il Popolo d'Italia, the newspaper of the recently-founded National Fascist Party. During the March on Rome, Bottai was along with Ulisse Igliori and Gino Calza-Bini, the head of the Roman squadrismo, supporting the Blackshirts' political violence. Political career Bottai serving in the French Foreign Legion After 1921 election, Bottai was elected in the Chamber of Deputies for the National Blocs but was removed for his young age. He returned to the Chamber in 1924 and syayed until 1943. In 1923, he became leader of the intransigent national- syndicalist and revolutionary faction of fascism. To support his ideas, Bottai founded Critica fascista (\\"Fascist Critic\\"), a cultural periodical, co- operating with other left-leaning fascists like Filippo De Pisis, Renato Guttuso and Mario Mafai. Bottai worked to the Ministry of Corporations, introducing the Labour Charter and planning a \\"Corporative Academic Pole\\" in Pisa, from 1926 to 1932, when he was excluded by Mussolini from the Ministry. In 1933, Bottai established and chaired the National Institute of the Social Security (, INPS). He was appointed Fascist Governor of Rome (1935–1936) but resigned to fight in the Second Italo-Ethiopian War with the rank of major. In 5 May 1936, Bottai and Pietro Badoglio entered in Addis Abeba, and Bottai was appointed as vity governor. After the war, Bottai returned in Rome to be Education Minister. During his ministry, Bottai proclaimed a law (the so- called \\"Bottai Law\\") on safeguarding public and cultural heritage and the preservation of natural beauties. He also co-worked with art critics Giulio Carlo Argan and Cesare Brandi to improve the Italian cultural life. In the late 1930s, Bottai became more radical and a germanophile. In 1938 he expressed support to Raical Laws against Italian Jews, and in 1940, he founded Primato (\\"Record\\"), a magazine that supported the Aryan race's supremacy and interventionism in the war. Bottai thought that the \\"Fascist Revolution\\" was incomplete and that what was needed was a return to the original, \\"pure\\" fascism. World War II However, the Italian intervention in World War II resulted in disaster. The Campaign on the Eastern Front caused the death or the injury of approximately 77,000 soldiers, with more than 39,000 injured. Bottai voted for Mussolini's arrest, which had been proposed by Dino Grandi, on 25 July 1943 after Italy's defeat had become evident. In 1944, the Italian Social Republic condemned Bottai to death, during the Verona trial, but Bottai hid in a Roman convent. In 1944, Bottai enlisted in the French Foreign Legion with the pseudodyn Andrea Battaglia. He fought in Provence during Operation Dragoon and then in the Western Allied invasion of Germany. Later life After the war, Bottai remained in France and continued to serve in the Foreign Legion until 1948, when he was discharged. For his role in the final stages of World War II, he got an amnesty for his role in fascism. Returning in Italy in 1953, Bottai founded the periodical ABC (not to be confused with the magazine with the same name) and Il Popolo di Roma, which was financed by ex-fascist Vittorio Cini, who supported centrist and conservative views. Bottai's died in Rome in 1959. At his funeral was Aldo Moro, who like his father, had been Bottai's friend and assistant during his career.

Aside from its runtime system, which is written in C, SML/NJ is written in Standard ML. It was originally developed jointly by Bell Laboratories and Princeton University. Its name is a reference both to the American state of New Jersey in which Princeton and Bell Labs are located and to Standard Oil of New Jersey, the famous oil monopoly of the early 20th century. Features SML/NJ extends the SML'97 Basis Library with several additional top-level structures: * System info – the \`SysInfo\` structure provides information about the runtime system, such as the operating system kind, type and version and whether or not the machine supports multiprocessing. * Weak pointers – the \`Weak\` structure provides support for weak pointers. * Lazy suspensions – the \`Susp\` structure implements the suspensions necessary for lazy evaluation (as opposed to eager evaluation). * Compiler internals – the \`Internals\` structure provides access to several of the compiler internals, including methods to instantiate and modify the signal table. * Unsafe access – the \`Unsafe\` structure provides unsafe access to data structures and runtime-system functions. * Visible compiler structures – SML/NJ also includes structures that provide access to the ML compiler, which contains substructures for execution profiling, control of compiler error- message printing and warnings, and customizable pretty printing. Additionally, SML/NJ provides some syntactic constructs that are not standard features of SML'97: * Vector expressions and patterns – SML/NJ allows the creation of vectors with the \`#[exp0, exp1, ..., expn−1]\` syntax and allows pattern- matching on them with analogous syntax. * Or-patterns – SML/NJ extends the syntax of SML'97 patterns to allow for a matching multiple patterns in a single rule, provided each pattern has the same type, using \`(apat1  ...  apatn) => exp\` . * Object language embedding – SML/NJ provides the quote/antiquote syntax that permits the embedding of expressions in an object language's concrete syntax within ML expressions and programs. * Higher-order modules – SML/NJ supports the parametrization of functors by allowing functors to be components of structures, in addition to Standard ML's parametric modules in the form of functors. Successor ML features With the 110.81 release, the evolution of SML/NJ is geared towards evolving the Standard ML Basis library and supporting Successor ML features. In the current release, the Successor ML features can be enabled using the command-line option \`-Cparser.succ-ml=true\`. The Successor ML documents have been extracted from the SML/NJ '97 TeX files and made available as a GitHub repository of TeX documents which the community is expected to collaborate and grow the language. In addition, HaMLet has a complete implementation of Successor ML features. The practical knowledge so gained, is being incorporated in SML/NJ as it evolves through its releases.

The monohull sportsboat is notable for its ability to plane over the water downwind in modest winds, and for its combination of a simple design that is highly tunable. The Melges 24 has more than 850 boats sold, and is the most popular design produced by Melges Performance Sailboats, a United States company founded by Harry Melges, father of former Olympic sailor Buddy Melges. The boat was designed in 1992 by the Reichel/Pugh design team, and went into production in 1993. Of the nearly nine hundred Melges 24s that have been produced, approximately half were sold in North America with the remainder in Europe, and with fleets in Japan as well.. Fleets are now growing in the Asia Pacific with Northshore Yachts taking the role of building boats for the Australasian Countries. They have built 9 so far with a growing fleet of around 10 Melges 24 in Australia. The boat is long and wide at the beam. The fractional rig carries around 1000 square feet (93 m²) of sail area, main, jib and spinnaker combined. Upwind, it has a mainsail and 100% jib. Downwind, it has a large 670 square foot (62 m²) Asymmetrical spinnaker that flies from a retractable bowsprit. The boat's hull is made from lightweight fiberglass. The mast, rudder, bowsprit, and keel fin are made from carbon fiber for light weight. The hull is generally flat on the bottom, making it plane easily. The 630 pound (286 kg) keel bulb can retract up to the hull bottom to make it easier to put on a trailer. The boat is generally raced with a crew of four or five. Because the boat sails faster with a heavier crew, class rules for racing limit crew weight to 827 pounds (375 kg) total. Unlike most spinnaker- rigged keelboats, the Melges 24 is designed so that no foredeck work is required to fly the spinnaker; it is launched, trimmed, and doused from a launch bag in the pit. Reichel/Pugh also designed other modern Melges boats, including the Melges 17, Melges 32 and Melges 20.

In June 2009, the Adelaide Institute was linked with an American white supremacist, James von Brunn, charged with killing a security guard in Washington's Holocaust Museum.Adelaide Institute's online link to white supremacist gunman Töben and his associates at the Adelaide Institute have denied \\"being Holocaust deniers\\" in interviews conducted by Australian media, claiming they cannot deny that which never happened. The Institute's stated goal is to expose the myth of the Holocaust. Activities Supporters of the Institute have in the past been active in organisations such as Australians For Free Speech, which held a rally in 1994. The Institute has also been implicated in distributing Holocaust denialist material through mainstream and alternative publications. Letters to the editor and talk radio appear to be the favourite means of disseminating the worldview of the Institute. Prior to the opening of the film Schindler's List in Adelaide, members of the institute distributed Holocaust denial pamphlets on the street and through the mail, apparently targeting those of Jewish background. Additionally, members of the Institute sent materials denying the Holocaust to prominent Australian newspapers masquerading as objective movie reviews, some of which reached publication. The activity of the Institute appears to have declined since its initial burst of activity in the mid-1990s. The Institute does however still maintain a website on which statements on various issues are posted from time to time. Legal action against Töben The Adelaide Institute website triggered the arrest of Fredrick Töben in Germany in 1998 for breaching Germany's Holocaust Law, Section 130, that outlaws \\"Incitement to hatred\\". Töben was sentenced in April 1999 to 10 months in prison, but had already served seven months during trial, and was released upon payment of a $5000 bond-Kaution. The Institute's website was drawn to the attention of the Australian Human Rights and Equal Opportunity Commission (HREOC) in 2000, which ruled in Jones v Toben [2000] HREOCA 39 that a person contravenes section 18C of the Racial Discrimination Act when they refer to the treatment of Jews in the 1930s and 1940s as having been \\"mythologised\\".. The HREOC found that the Adelaide Institute had breached section 18C by publishing material on the website the consequences of which were \\"vilificatory, bullying, insulting and offensive\\" to the Jewish population, and ordered Töben to close the site and apologise to the people he had offended. As rulings of the HREOC are not enforceable at law, the case went to the Federal Court of Australia to enforce the Commission's decision. The Court ordered in 2002 that Töben remove from the Adelaide Institute website any material which conveys one or any of the following imputations: * there is serious doubt that the Holocaust occurred * it is unlikely that there were homicidal gas chambers at Auschwitz * Jewish people who are offended by and challenge Holocaust denial are of limited intelligence * some Jewish people, for improper purposes, including financial gain, have exaggerated the number of Jews killed during World War II and the circumstances in which they were killed. In Toben v Jones (2003) 129 FCR 515, [2003] FCAFC 137, the Full Court of the Federal Court dismissed an appeal from those orders, in which Töben challenged the constitutional validity of section 18C.. Electronic Frontiers Australia spoke out against the ruling, taking the view that \\"when encountering racist or hateful speech, the best remedy to be applied is generally more speech, not enforced silence.\\"EFA Letter to HREOC, Oct 1998 One of the reasons mentioned is that suppressing such content results in perception that the speaker must have something important to say, and \\"massively increased interest in what would otherwise be marginal ideas.\\" Associates * John Tuson Bennett (1937–2013), one of Australia's longest and most active Holocaust deniers, active in the Holocaust denial movement since the late 1970s. *Kerry Bolton, a New Zealand political activist who published many books promoting an extreme neo-Nazi, anti-Semitic viewpoint.

It is a strong base (pKb=-1.76), much like the other alkali metal hydroxides such as sodium hydroxide and potassium hydroxide. In fact, caesium hydroxide is corrosive enough to dissolve through glass quickly . Due to its high reactivity, Caesium Hydroxide is extremely hygroscopic. Laboratory caesium hydroxide is typically a hydrate. It is an anisotropic etchant of silicon, exposing octahedral planes. This technique can form pyramids and regularly shaped etch pits for uses such as Microelectromechanical systems. It is known to have a higher selectivity to etch highly p-doped silicon than the more commonly used potassium hydroxide. This compound is not commonly used in experiments due to the high extraction cost of caesium and its reactive behaviour.

Whilst Cumbernauld was designated a new town in 1955, the Village itself has a pre-mediaeval history, with a Roman settlement being built in the area due to its proximity to the Antonine Wall. After the Roman period the settlement remained and grew to such an extent that the Comyn family built their chapel there. It is recorded that, in 1500, the Black Death led to a special plea from the surviving people of Cumbernauld to the church authorities in Glasgow to allow them to establish their own cemetery rather than taking all their dead to St. Ninian's in Kirkintilloch. This source is also quoted in \\"Excavations at 3-11 Main Street, Cumbernauld\\". The villagers were granted permission to do so, and used the ground at the existing Comyns' chapel which dates from the end of the 12th century. Farming in long strips or Lang Riggs was carried out in the village. The Flemings (who would become the Earls of Wigtown) later took over the Comyns' castle in Cumbernauld. In the 18th century this was replaced by Cumbernauld House The Wynd with a pend rather than an early underpass and pavements beside the road Guy's MeadowBy the Seventeenth century the main industry of the Village was hand loom weaving, but this subsequently changed as due to the village's proximity to the Forth and Clyde canal and rich source of natural minerals and stone it became a site of mining and quarrying. The Village was also the site of a number of tenant held farms on the Flemings' estate. The 19th century Groome's Gazetteer states that Cumbernauld is: \\"A picturesque old place, sheltered to E and SE by the grounds of Cumbernauld House, it was created a burgh of barony in 1649, and has a post office under Glasgow, a branch of the Royal Bank, a local savings' bank, 2 chief inns, gas-works, many new handsome villas, and a cattle-fair on the second Thursday of May. The parish church here is an old building, containing 660 sittings; the Free church dates from 1826, having belonged to the Original Secession, but has been lately almost rebuilt; and there is also a new U.P. church. Handloom weaving of checks and other striped fabrics is still carried on, but mining and quarrying are the staple industry. Pop. (1861) 1561, (1871) 1193, (1881) 1064.\\" Cumbernauld had one of the oldest curling societies in the world which was established in the 18th century. The curling pond was near the Spur Inn, on the other side of the Bog Stank to the village. October 1878 was a difficult time locally made worse by the failure of the Bank of Glasgow in which much of the village's money was invested. As the mining industry declined the village was further boosted by the decision to site a new town in the vicinity, with Cumbernauld lending its name to this new town. Today Looking North from Wilderness Brae to entrance to Village near old curling pond Pebbled Monster Today, Cumbernauld Village is quite characteristically different from most of the rest of the town, as it contains a high number of local amenities, and its structure of having pavements beside the roads in the Village is quite unlike the rest of the planned new town, with the possible exception of Condorrat which, like Cumbernauld Village, is a settlement of many years' standing before the new town's construction. Cumbernauld Village has an active local community and local people are involved in the Village Community Council and in Cumbernauld Village Action for the Community. The latter is a community group campaigning for improvements to the amenity of the Village. Cumbernauld United FC Cumbernauld's non-league (junior) football team, Cumbernauld United, play in the Village at Guy's Meadow. Cumbernauld United also have a full youth academy with teams at all age groups from under 6 upwards, considered by many as one of the best in Central Scotland.

He has had much success crossing over into the American comic book market. Primarily working for Marvel Comics, Jenkins had a big part shaping the characters of the company, helping via the Marvel Knights imprint to propel Marvel from Chapter 11 bankruptcy before choosing to focus on independent publications. He is also noted for his groundbreaking narrative work in the field of video games, and is recognized as one of the world's preeminent \\"cross-media\\" creators for his work across such multiple media as animation, video games, comic books, and film. Despite his commercial success, Jenkins is a noted advocate for creators' rights thanks in part to his early days at Mirage Studios and Tundra Publishing, where he witnessed first hand the drafting of the Creators Bill of Rights. He has spoken frequently in support of mentoring, and the need for hands-on education in the entertainment industry. Jenkins is the Founder and Chief Creative Officer of META Studios, a cross-media development and production house based in Atlanta, Georgia. His current projects include Commissioner Gordon and Black Adam with DC Comics. Early life Paul Jenkins was raised by a single parent in the West Country of his native United Kingdom. He gained his first writing and directing experience while studying for his degree in acting. Jenkins moved to the United States in 1987, where he first taught music and drama to learning-disabled children before embarking on a successful career in the entertainment industry. Career After moving to the US, he joined Mirage Studios in 1988, where he worked as editor/production manager. He edited Kevin Eastman and Peter Laird's books, including Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles, and even negotiated their licensing deals. Seeing the TMNT were fully owned and controlled by Eastman and Laird, Jenkins gained an important understanding of the benefits of cross-media development and ancillary exploitation. Leaving Mirage, Jenkins followed Eastman to Tundra Publishing - another Eastman publishing venture - where he became Editor-in- Chief at the age of 24. His duties also included heading the production and licensing departments. During this time, Jenkins edited such notable comics creators as Alan Moore, Neil Gaiman, Dave McKean, and George Pratt. This was followed by stints as Editor-in-Chief at Majestic Entertainment and the short- lived Scoreboard Comics. Tired of editing, Jenkins pitched to several companies as a writer. Despite minimal writing experience, he journeyed to San Diego Comicon where he approached DC Comics' Vertigo editor Lou Stathis and pitched for the prestigious gig as writer of Hellblazer. In 1994, with no previous mainstream credits to his name, he took over as writer of Hellblazer, and began what would go on to be a five-year-long stint. His work on this title gained him attention in the American comic industry, and as of January 2016, his complete run has been collected. Paul's Marvel Comics career began in 1997, when he worked on reviving some of the company's horror-themed properties. He relaunched the psychological horror title Werewolf By Night, writing six issues, until the title was canceled to start the anthology title Strange Tales, the first two issues of which printed the rest of his Werewolf By Night story. Later in the year, he and artist Jae Lee were responsible for launching the critically acclaimed and commercially successful Marvel Knights series Inhumans. The limited series ran twelve issues between November 1998 and October 1999, and earned Jenkins an Eisner Award.\\"1999 Will Eisner Comic Industry Awards\\". Hahn Library Comic Book Awards Almanac. Retrieved 23 March 2014. In 2000, Jenkins and Lee followed up their collaboration with another five issue Marvel Knights limited series, this time concerning The Sentry, a series Jenkins had unsuccessfully pitched to Marvel and DC Comics for a number of years. Although the mentally tortured hero was an original creation of Jenkins', Marvel ran a marketing hoax claiming that the character was a long- lost Silver Age creation of Stan Lee himself, even pre-dating the Fantastic Four. Several years later, Brian Michael Bendis reused the Sentry by making him a member of the New Avengers : Jenkins himself was featured as a character in the storyline which reintroduced the Sentry.New Avengers Vol. 1 #07-10 2005 Also in 2000, Jenkins given writing assignments in the mainstream Marvel Universe. In March, he was made the regular writer on The Incredible Hulk. Like in much of his earlier work, Jenkins conducted a psychiatric examination of Bruce Banner, including a look at Banner's multiple Hulk personas. His 20 issue run on The Incredible Hulk ran until November 2001. During this same period, Jenkins became the regular writer of Peter Parker: Spider-Man. Taking over the title from issue 20, in August 2000, he wrote it until its end in August 2003. Marvel placed him on The Spectacular Spider-Man Vol.2, which Jenkins wrote for most of its three-year run, which paired him with artist Humberto Ramos. In 2001 he collaborated with penciller Andy Kubert on the six- issue limited series Origin, which for the first time revealed the details of Wolverine's childhood and early life. The title was one of the biggest sales successes of that year for Marvel. Jenkins later wrote Wolverine: The End, a story addressing plot threads begun in Origin, although it is not a direct sequel, as Marvel's The End stories are not canon. Jenkins later wrote Wolverine for Marvel, and The Darkness for Top Cow. Another project undertaken by Jenkins for Marvel was the Mythos series of one-shots where Jenkins, with Paolo Rivera's painted artwork, would retell the origin stories of Marvel's movie adapted characters to bridge the gap between the movie and the comic book versions of the characters. In 2005 Jenkins wrote the Dark Horse Comics six issue miniseries Revelations, illustrated by Ramos, and Marvel's The Sentry with artist John Romita Jr.. In 2006 he wrote his own independent comic, Sidekick, published by Image Comics.Paul Jenkins Civil Wars and Sidekicks , Cinescape, 26 September 2006 That same year, he wrote Civil War: Front Line, a tie-in to Marvel's crossover storyline, \\"Civil War\\" that depicted the transformation of Robbie Baldwin from Speedball to Penance,\\"Paul Jenkins on Penance\\" .

Opened on 24 February 1914, it was India's first sea bridge, and was the longest sea bridge in India until the opening of the Bandra-Worli Sea Link in 2010. The rail bridge is, for the most part, a conventional bridge resting on concrete piers, but has a double-leaf bascule section midway, which can be raised to let ships and barges pass through. Until 1988, the Pamban bridge was the only surface transport that connected Tamil Nadu's island of Rameswaram to the mainland. In Dec-2018, the bascule of this bridge was damaged, which suspended the transportation on the bridge for 3 months. Rail movement was again restored on 27 February 2019. In 1988, a road bridge was also constructed parallel to the rail bridge. This road bridge is also known as Indira Gandhi Road Bridge. The Pamban Road Bridge connects the National Highway (NH 49) with the Rameswaram island. It stands on the Palk Strait and between the shores of Mandapam (a place on the Indian mainland) and Pamban (one of the fishermen town in Rameswaram island). It was inaugurated by former Indian Prime Minister Rajiv Gandhi on 2 October 1988. This 2.345 km long Bridge took close to 14 years to be completed.  Location  The Pamban railway bridge spans a 2.065 m wide strait between the Indian mainland and Rameswaram Island. The mainland end of the bridge is located at . The bridge is located in the world's second most corrosive environment after Florida, making its maintenance a challenging job. The location is also a cyclone-prone high wind velocity zone.  Design  Lifting spans allow small ships to pass through The railway bridge is located above sea level and is long. The bridge consists of 143 piers and has a double-leaf bascule section with a Scherzer rolling type lift span that can be raised to let ships pass. Each half of the lifting span weighs . The two leaves of the bridge are opened manually using levers.  Planning and construction  Plans for a bridge to connect to mainland was suggested in 1870 as the British Administration sought ways to increase trade with Ceylon. The construction began in August 1911 and was opened on 24 February 1914. The adjacent road bridge was opened in 1988. As of 5 December 2018, the bridge was closed due to a crack in the bridge and the maintenance work is going on. The Indian Railway Minister Piyush Goyal announced that a new railway bridge will be constructed near the old Pamban Bridge at a cost of Rs. 250 crores. This new dual track bridge is planned to be constructed in automotive mode, allowing two ships to pass this bridge at the same time.  Maintenance  The bridge was damaged during the 1964 Rameswaram cyclone and required repair work. Strengthening work was carried out on the bridge under the supervision of E. Sreedharan in 2009 to enable it to carry goods trains. On 13 January 2013, the bridge required repair work to the piers after suffering minor damage from a naval barge. In 2016, the Ministry of Railways sanctioned to replace the existing long rolling type span with a long single truss span which could be opened automatically. All train movement was stopped from 5 December 2018 when a fissure was noticed on 4 December 2018. Rail movement on the bridge is restored as of 10 March 2019.  Railway  The railway bridge carried metre gauge trains connecting Mandapam on mainland India to Pamban. Indian Railways upgraded the bridge to carry broad gauge trains and the work was completed on 12 August 2007. From Pamban, the railway line bifurcated, one line towards Rameshwaram about up and another branch line of terminating at Dhanushkodi. The Boat mail express runs from Chennai Egmore to Rameswaram. The train ran up to Dhanushkodi until 1964 when the metre-gauge branch line from Pamban to Dhanushkodi was destroyed during the 1964 Dhanushkodi cyclone.  Road  Pamban Road Bridge The construction works of Pamban Road bridge was commenced on 17 November 1974 by the Indian Highway department and contracted to M/S Neelakandan Brothers Engs, Madras. After the 1978 cyclone the work was carried out slowly, and few years later the contract was given to the New Gammon India Ltd. The Government sanctioned 16.6514 crore INR by 1986. The work was completed on 1988.  Accidents  On 23 December 1964, an estimated storm surge struck the island, overturning the Pamban-Dhanuskodi passenger train killing all 150 passengers on board. On 13 January 2013, the bridge suffered minor damage when a naval barge drifted into it.

The gun carrier was designed to transport a 6-inch howitzer or a 60-pounder gun forward soon after an attack to support infantry in advanced positions. Gun carriers were first used in the Battle of Pilckem Ridge (31 July – 2 August 1917) during the Third Battle of Ypres (31 July – 10 November 1917). The carriers moved guns and equipment but were used for the rest of the war mainly for carrying equipment and supplies through areas under fire, where porters in the open would have suffered many casualties. The 6-inch howitzer could be fired while mounted, making the Gun Carrier Mark I the first modern self- propelled gun, a weapon capable of independent action and having tactical mobility on the battlefield. Background In early 1916, the tactical conditions on the Western Front could leave infantry who had captured positions exhausted, disorganised, short of supplies, out of touch with the rear and incapable of defeating a counter-attack. Allied artillery was being moved by tractor and an armoured, tracked vehicle would allow artillery to be moved in areas under German fire. Major John Greg, an engineer working for Metropolitan, Carriage, Wagon and Finance, proposed to build special mechanised artillery, using parts of the Tank Mark I. Greg began work on a design with Major Walter Wilson, an inventor who had worked on the Tank Mark I, on 7 March.. At first, carriage of the BL 6-inch howitzer, 8-inch howitzer or the 60-pounder gun (5-inch) was envisaged but the idea of transporting the 8-inch howitzer was dropped. On 3 March 1917, the prototype was tested at Oldbury with other experimental vehicles at a Tank Trials Day. Design The prototype Gun Carrier Mark I (War Department serial number GC 100) was long, and included a Tank Mark I steering tail; with the tail and carrying a gun, the equipment was long. The vehicle was wide and high. The gun carrier moved on tracks wide and about high. The empty weight was and the vehicle was propelled by a Daimler engine The vehicle had a Tank Mark I transmission of a primary gearbox with two forward and one reverse gear; there were two-speed secondary gears for each track. The gun carrier was operated by a commander, driver and two gearsmen. An armoured box enclosed the rear half of the vehicle, overhanging the tracks which ran through a gap. The front half of the machine had a platform for a gun with two armoured cabs, one for the driver and one for the commander, above the tracks at the front on each side. The vehicle had an endurance of about eleven hours, with a top speed of on flat ground and could cross trenches up to wide. There was no room for track spuds to be attached and in tests, it was found that mud and debris clogged the track runs, pierced the superstructure and holed the radiators above them. A 6-inch howitzer or a 60-pounder gun could be winched backwards onto the gun platform at the front and secured, the wheels being removed and hung over the sides of the gun carrier. Sixty rounds of ammunition were carried for either gun bringing the weight to for the 6-inch howitzer and for the 60-pounder. The armoured box at the back accommodated an eight-man gun crew and each vehicle carried a machine-gun. Production=Gun Carrier Mark I Work by Greg and Wilson began on 7 March 1916 but only with GHQ approval, which was received on 17 May 1916. The Ordnance Board refused to approve the design on 15 June 1916 and Albert Stern, the Secretary of the Landship Committee appealed to David Lloyd George, the Minister of Munitions. Lloyd George over- ruled the Board and unilaterally placed an order for fifty vehicles the next day. On 29 May 1917 the War Office ordered The prototype was built by the Metropolitan Carriage, Wagon & Finance Co. and was finished on 1 January 1917. An order was placed with Kitson & Co. in Leeds for 49 gun carriers (changed to 47 gun carriers and two salvage vehicles on 16 October 1917). Trials of the prototype began around 2 February 1917 and at Shoeburyness ranges the 60-pounder was fired from the carrier. Six gun carriers and the two salvage vehicles were delivered to the army in the second quarter of 1917, the third quarter, the fourth quarter and the last five in the first quarter of 1918 at a price of £168,000 for the carriers and £10,000 for the two salvage vehicles. Salvage vehicles The two forward driving cabs were removed, the carrying platform was covered and a hand-crane to lift -loads on a jib or using shear legs. The box had a cab in front, behind which was a winding drum connected to the engine for hauling with a wire hawser; the price of the two vehicles was £10,000. In December a third vehicle was equipped with a Priestman Brothers clamshell steam-grab. David Fletcher suggests this was the track chassis of the prototype Gun Carrier The Gun Carrier Machine – Part I 2017 Gun Carrier Mark II A revised Gun Carrier Mark II was designed but only a mock- up was built. The hull covered two-thirds of the length of the vehicle and the carrying platform was moved to the back. The front end was built on similar lines to Tank Marks IV and V, with the tracks raised at the front for climbing obstacles. The vehicle was to be powered by a 150-hp Ricardo engine through epicyclic gears. Guns would be embarked at the rear and retain their wheels but not fire from the vehicle. Operational service=1917 Gun Carrier arrived in France before the Third Battle of Ypres (31 July – 10 November 1917) and was attached to XVIII Corps for field trials. The gun carrier was first used at the Battle of Pilckem Ridge (31 July – 2 August 1917) and the steering tail was soon dispensed with. During the fighting in Flanders, the carrier brought several hundred tons of ammunition and several 60-pounder guns forward. On at least one occasion, a 6-inch howitzer was fired from which then changed position to confuse the Germans. The 1st Gun Carrier Company was formed on 6 September and greatly eased the task of moving supplies, each carrier moving loads of which would have needed a carrying party of By the end of the year carriers were in France. As supply tanks, the gun carriers had much greater capacity than converted Mark I and Mark IV tanks and were in constant demand. Seven gun carriers were available for the opening of the Battle of Cambrai on 20 November 1917. 1918 In June 1918, the two gun carrier companies were converted to supply companies and attached to the 3rd and 5th Tank Brigades. At the Battle of Hamel (4 July 1918), Captain James Smith led the four machines of the 1st Gun Carrier Company forward with of engineer stores to within of the final objective, within thirty minutes of its capture. As the vehicles returned the crews picked up seventy wounded soldiers and transported them to a dressing station. Four officers and sixteen men transported the equivalent of the equivalent of about two infantry battalions' worth of stores and equipment. One gun carrier moved of barbed wire, pickets, sheets, fifty tins of water, bombs, of ammunition and twenty boxes of hand grenades. When the 1st and 2nd Supply companies reached France, they joined the 1st and 4th Tank Brigades and the 3rd, 4th and 5th Supply companies were posted to Blingel Camp, near Bermicourt which had driving and maintenance facilities. In late July the 3rd and 5th Supply companies were re-equipped with Mark IV supply tanks and Mark IVs with fitments to haul sledges full of supplies. By August the 1st Gun Carrier Company was attached to the 5th Tank Brigade and the 2nd Company to the 3rd Tank Brigade. The carriers of the 1st Gun Carrier Company were allotted to the Australian Corps during the Battle of Amiens (8–12 August 1918). On the night of the 1st Gun Carrier Company drove to an orchard on the west of Villers-Bretonneux carrying explosives. A shell from a German battery near Chipilly ignited a camouflage net on one of the carriers, thick smoke rose and German artillery bombarded the orchard. The vehicle crews and some Australian gunners rescued three carriers which were driven out of danger but the rest exploded; Major W. Partington, commander of the 1st Gun Carrier Company was wounded. When not needed for tank support, the gun carriers shifted engineer stores and ammunition for the infantry, being of great use in areas swept by machine-gun fire. The 2nd Gun Carrier Company carried forward a 6-inch howitzer to conduct harassing fire at night, moving around to deceive the Germans. Several gas attacks were carried out by gun carriers moving Livens projectors and gas bombs over ground too cut up for wheeled vehicles. The cross-country mobility of the gun carriers enabled more bombs to be fired in the dark and the carriers to vacate the area before dawn. For the remainder of the war, gun carriers were in great demand to carry tank supplies over ground unfit for wheeled vehicles. On 18 September, during the Hundred Days Offensive, Australian infantry were so understrength during operations against the Hindenburg outpost-line, that two gun carriers moved supplies to the first objective. Eleven days later, the 5th Tank Supply Company, with supported the Australian Corps at the Hindenburg Line. Analysis Once the gun had been winched aboard and fixed to a cross beam, it was near its usual firing position. In a 2013 publication, John Glanfield described the vehicle as a \\"dual self-propelled gun/gun carrier\\". The vehicle had been designed for the 6-inch howitzer, which could be fired from the vehicle and the 60-pounder Mk II, none of which were in France in 1917 and the Mk I had to be disembarked to fire. As supply vehicles, the gun carriers excelled, being able to carry a heavy load on the platform, rather than inconveniently placed inside a converted tank.

It was built in 1960 by money from the estate of the late Louis Carlisle Walker at a cost of $1 million, and on October 27, 1960 was given to the City of Muskegon. It is currently home to the Muskegon Lumberjacks of the United States Hockey League, Muskegon Risers SC of Major Arena Soccer League 2, and the West Michigan Ironmen indoor football team. The arena was built on a site of a former supermarket, and in addition to sports is also used for concerts, trade shows, conventions and other events. The arena measures from the arena floor to the ceiling. The arena contains of arena floor space, and can seat up to 4,900 for basketball, up to 5,200 for concerts, and 4,000 for ice shows and wrestling. The Arena has gone through several renovations, with the most recent two occurring in 2010-2011 and another in 2017-2018. Both renovations included removing seats from the arena, which once had more than 5,000 seats. The most recent renovation, which is still ongoing as of January 11, 2018, includes the addition of Rad Dads restaurant on the building's east side, behind section 109. A portion of a former Plumb's grocery store, built in 1936, was actually incorporated into the Arena; it was known as the LC Walker Arena annex, used for conventions, banquets, meetings and other special events. Now, the area is used by Peak Performance, an athletic training and rehabilitation center. Louis Carlisle Walker Louis Carlisle Walker (1875–1963) was a furniture maker, an 1896 graduate of the University of Michigan and founder of the Shaw-Walker company which revolutionized the office furniture industry. His success in business was matched by his generosity to the community, and the arena bore his name until 2019. ReferencesExternal links *L.C.

Glover. He describes what he calls the \\"Nice guy Syndrome\\", a condition in men who appear to be always nice and who try to avoid conflict at all costs. Glover's premise is that nice guys have been conditioned by their childhoods and by society to believe that they will be successful only if they make everyone happy and never cause any problems for others. However, this desire for approval results in self- loathing. In other words, nice guys want approval, but don't think they deserve it. This creates internal frustration, since nice guys never try to obtain what they want in life. In addition, the nice guy's desire to obtain approval from everyone (especially women), often causes him to actually behave in very un-nice ways. This includes dishonesty (about themselves), passive- aggressive behavior, and inauthenticity. Dr. Glover's prescription involves getting nice guys to recognize that their needs and desires are important, and that to make others happy they must first learn to make themselves happy. One of the primary ways advised in the book to remedy this is for nice guys to learn to embrace and develop their masculine traits, instead of fearing and suppressing them.

Biography=Early years William Paul Jenkins (known as Paul Jenkins) was born in 1923 in Kansas City, Missouri, where he was raised. He met Frank Lloyd Wright who was commissioned by the artist's great-uncle, the Rev. Burris Jenkins (whose own motto was to \\"live dangerously\\") to rebuild his church in Kansas City, Missouri after a fire.Machin, Julian. Paul Jenkins: Painter whose art brimmed with the energy of life, The Independent, London, June 28, 2012.\\"Religion: Something New in Churches.\\" Time. December 2, 1940. (Wright suggested that Jenkins should think about a career in agriculture rather than art.) The young Jenkins also visited Thomas Hart Benton and confided his intention to become a painter. The Eastern art collection of the Nelson-Atkins Museum (then, the William Rockhill Nelson Art Gallery) had an early influence on him.Jenkins, Paul, and Suzanne Donnelly Jenkins. 1983. Paul Jenkins, Anatomy of a Cloud. New York: Harry N. Abrams. In his teenage years, Jenkins moved to Struthers, Ohio to live with his mother, Nadyne Herrick, and stepfather, who both ran the local newspaper, the Hometown Journal (then the Struthers Journal). After graduating from Struthers High School, he served in the U.S. Maritime Service and entered the U.S. Naval Air Corps during World War II. In 1948, he moved to New York City where, on the G.I. Bill, he studied at the Art Students League of New York with Yasuo Kuniyoshi for four years, and with Morris Kantor. During that time, he met Mark Rothko, Jackson Pollock, Lee Krasner, and Barnett Newman. In 1953, he traveled to Europe, working for three months in Taormina in Sicily before settling in Paris, France. From 1955 on, the artist shared his time between New York and Paris.Nordland, Gerald. 1971. Paul Jenkins retrospective. Houston, Tex: Museum of Fine Arts; distributed by Universe Books, New York. Chronology=1950s In 1953, after studying with Yasuo Kuniyoshi at the Art Students League of New York, Jenkins traveled to Italy and Spain, settling in Paris where his first solo exhibition took place in 1954 at Studio Paul Facchetti on the rue de Lille. Paul Facchetti, with the help of Alfonso Ossorio, held in 1952, an exhibition of the work of Jackson Pollock in his gallery, which was well known for showing works by abstract artists of the time, among others. Jenkins' first solo exhibition in the US took place in 1954 at the pioneering gallery of Zoe Dusanne in Seattle. His first solo exhibition in New York was held in 1956 at the Martha Jackson Gallery, a leading gallery of the time.Martha Jackson Gallery Archives. UB Art Galleries. The Whitney Museum of American Art in New York purchased the painting \\"Divining Rod\\" from this exhibition. In the '50s, Jenkins achieved prominence both in New York and Europe for his early abstractions. At the Gutai exhibition held at the Martha Jackson Gallery in New York in 1958, Jenkins is invited by Jiro Yoshihara to work with Gutai in Osaka; however, Jenkins waited until 1964 to implement this invitation.Paul Jenkins Archive. Gutai. From the artist's studio in Paris in 1959, Peggy Guggenheim purchased \\"Osage,\\" a work on canvas, and continued to later purchase the artist's work. Jenkins continued to experiment with flowing paints, pouring pigment in streams of various thicknesses, with white linear overlays. Jenkins, described as an abstract expressionist, would at times call himself \\"an abstract phenomenist.\\" His early works were made in oil on primed canvas, as he continued working on paper with ink and with watercolor. In 1959 and 1960, he explored the writings of Goethe and Kant. Influenced by Goethe's color theories, he began to preface the titles of his works with the word \\"Phenomena\\" followed by a key word or phrase. Regarding his paintings, he once said, \\"I have conversations with them, and they tell me what they want to be called.\\" 1960s Gradually in 1960 he moved away from working in oil on canvas to acrylic. Jenkins began to paint using an ivory knife, a key tool in the creation of his work: The art historian Albert E. Elsen has noted: \\"Jenkins was not staining his canvas, because of the sizing and priming.\\"Elsen, Albert. Paul Jenkins. Harry N Abrams, Inc., NY 1973. Throughout the 60s, his work was shown worldwide, at major galleries and museums in Tokyo, London, New York, Paris, Amsterdam and elsewhere. In 1963, he took over Willem de Kooning's light-infused loft at Union Square in New York City where he worked until the end of 2000.London Times Obituary. July 21, 2012. In 1964, he traveled to Tokyo for his exhibition at the Tokyo Gallery and worked with Gutai in Osaka. Gutai works in Jenkins' collection are later shown in a 2009 exhibition curated by Ming Tiampo at the Pollock-Krasner House & Study Center in The Springs, East Hampton, then traveling to The Harold B. Lemmerman Gallery, New Jersey City University. In 2010, this exhibition traveled to UB Anderson Gallery of the State University of New York Buffalo.\\"Under Each Other’s Spell: The Gutai and New York.\\" Apr 10-Aug 22 2010. The Ivory Knife, a film by the Martha Jackson Gallery and Red Parrot, receives the Golden Eagle Award at the 1966 Venice Film Festival and is shown at the Museum of Modern Art in New York. His play, Strike the Puma, is published by Editions Gonthier in 1966, and in 1968 is performed off Broadway in New York City. During this time, Harry Abrams decides against including what the artist called his \\"black and white photo montages\\" in the forthcoming monograph then in preparation and published in 1973 with text by the late art historian Albert E. Elsen. Fragments of these autobiographical montages are later integrated into expanded collages that form Anatomy of a Cloud, published by Harry N. Abrams in 1983.Paul Jenkins Collages. Website. In 1968, Jenkins began the creation of a limited number of solid and unique sculptures in glass with Egidio Costantini in Murano. Several of these works were shown in the 2007 exhibition Viva Vetro! Glass Alive! Venice and America, 1950-2006.Art Net. Paul Jenkings. Group Exhibitions. 1970s Sculpture, already present in the artist's life in the 1950s, comes to the forefront with a series of works. In 1971, invited by Philip Pavia to participate in the Sculptors' Symposium held at the Cooper-Hewitt Museum in New York, Jenkins carves a 2-ton block of French limestone currently in the collection of the Hofstra Museum Sculpture Garden in Hempstead, New York. In this decade, the artist creates the first drawing for Meditation Mandala, a sculpture project for a park. Meditation Mandala is then cast in bronze, together with the sculptures Shakti Samothrace, Excalibur and Echo Chamber.Paul Jenkins Sculpture Collages, a little known aspect of the artist's work, begin to come into view. Prior to publication of Anatomy of a Cloud in 1983 by Harry N. Abrams, the artist's collages were largely unknown. A notable exception is the 1978 exhibition at the Gimpel Weitzenhoffer Gallery in New York, which integrated sculptural elements with collage. Yet, as early as the mid-fifties, visitors to the artist's Paris studio could see abstract collaged interior doors, as well as an inner wall later called Hokusai Arch, consisting of collaged Japanese woodcuts. In 1971-1972 a retrospective of works on canvas organized by Gerald Nordland and Philippe de Montebello took place at the Houston Museum of Fine Arts and the San Francisco Museum of Art. The Corcoran Gallery of Art in Washington, D.C. initiates an exhibition of his watercolors which traveled across the US for two years. In 1977, he begins to work in watercolor and on canvas in St. Croix in the Caribbean and is strongly influenced by the physicality of working outside, reminiscent of Taormina where he was confronted by color in a direct and decisive way. Jenkins gained a level of notoriety when his paintings appeared in the Academy Award- nominated 1978 movie An Unmarried Woman directed by Paul Mazursky.[32] (People Magazine, June 19, 1978). In 1979, during a long stay in the Caribbean, impasto begins to appear in Jenkins' paintings and he completes Phenomena Forcing a Passage at the Mark, a decisive painting to him in discovering the scraped veils with prism concentrates. 1980s As he pursued working in acrylic and in watercolor, Jenkins began to build full-scale elements of the Meditation Mandala sculpture in steel at the Shidoni Foundry in Tesuque, New Mexico; these elements are later installed in the Sculpture Garden of the Hofstra Museum.Hofstra University Museum, Paul Jenkins. At Shidoni Foundry, he also casts a unique sculpture in bronze, Four Corners. In 1987, through the initiative of Jean-Louis Martinoty, the Paris Opera stages Shaman to the Prism Seen, a dance-drama written by Jenkins retracing the passage of colors through the prism. Jenkins paints two canvases 30 x 40 feet each for the stage set, together with vertical paintings on canvas as sentinel elements for the stage, as well as costumes and silks, and creates a sculptural prism dais for Shaman.Bellet, Harry. Mort à New York de Paul Jenkins, peintre expressionniste abstrait, Le Monde, June 20, 2012. During the preparation of his monograph Anatomy of a Cloud, Jenkins creates collages in honor of the French theatre director and actor, Jean-Louis Barrault. These collages are shown at the French Cultural Services of the French Embassy in New York. At Barrault's request, these works travel to the theatre of the Renaud-Barrault Company, Le Théâtre du Rond-Point in Paris, to inaugurate La Maison Internationale du Théâtre, whose insignia is created from a work by the artist. The director, Alan Schneider, enters Anatomy of a Cloud into his workshop of actors at the University of California, San Diego. Jenkins begins to use granular poured veils on scraped prism forms; abstract collage elements integrate themselves in the works on canvas. Anatomy of a Cloud, an autobiographical book of what the artist calls \\"word impressions\\" and collages, is published by Harry N. Abrams in New York in 1983 and receives the silver medal from the Art Directors Club of New York. 1990s In 1990, invited by Abba Eban, Jenkins traveled to Israel and the following year to Japan and to Italy. In Paris, he created a series of original lithographs on stone entitled, Seven Aspects of Amadeus and the Others. In 1991, Jenkins' Polyptychs on canvas entitled, Conjunctions and Annexes are shown in New York at the Gimpel Weitzenhoffer Gallery; a book of the same title is published with a text by Pascal Bonafoux.Jenkins, Paul. 1991.

In the late 1990s, the Steel elements of Meditation Mandala made by the artist at the Shidoni Foundry in New Mexico were installed in the sculpture garden of Hofstra University in Hempstead, NY.Hofstra University Outdoor Sculpture Collection In 1999, the Hofstra Museum held an exhibition of the artist's works on canvas from 1954-1960 in New York and Paris.Paul Jenkins: 1954 - 1960, The Early Years in New York and Paris.

Early life A resident of Shamong Township, New Jersey, she is a graduate of Life Center Academy in Burlington, New Jersey.Hafetz, David. \\"Ambitious 17-year-old Proves She's In A Class By Herself\\", The Philadelphia Inquirer, May 17, 1997. Accessed May 13, 2011. \\"Today, Richardson graduates from Burlington County College with an associate's degree in liberal arts - just less than a month before she goes back to the Life Center Academy in Burlington Township to claim her high school diploma.\\" Career Her recording debut was in 2000 as the singer for 1 plus 1. Their single \\"Cherry Bomb\\" from the Elektra Records album of the same title reached the Top 40 of the Billboard Hot Dance Club Play chart in 2001, as well as the Top 50 in the Dance chart. Despite the initial promise of success, Richardson expressed displeasure with the marketing direction for 1 plus 1, and the act was recreated as alternative rock band MNQNN (pronounced \\"mannequin\\"). This music, differing greatly from the prior 1 plus 1 work, prompted Elektra to release them from their recording contract. MNQNN played rock clubs for a couple of years before the band went on an indefinite hiatus in June 2003. Richardson persuaded Josh Deutsch of Virgin Records to sign her to that record label. She reconnected with Steve Sydelink who had worked in her bands and was the drummer in Madonna's band. In 2004, Richardson returned to major label recording, after Sydelink introduced her to record producer Stuart Price (also known as Jacques Lu Cont) under the name 'Juliet'. The album resulting from this project, Random Order, was released in August 2005; reviews of advance copies have been well received by critics.BBC.co.ukBillboard.comJivemagazine.com The advance single, \\"Avalon\\", reached the top 5 on the European Dance chart in May 2005, and number one on the US Billboard Hot Dance Club Play chart in March 2005. \\"Avalon\\" was popular at the 2005 'Miami Winter Music Conference'. The song also reached the Top 30 of the UK Singles Chart in April 2005. She scored a second number one on the US dance chart in August with \\"Ride the Pain\\". In August 2005, Richardson released her debut album on Virgin Records. Recorded with the help of record producer Stuart Price of Les Rythmes Digitales, Zoot Woman and Madonna's Confessions On A Dance Floor fame, the album drew comparisons to a young Annie Lennox or Madonna thanks to her coolly emotional delivery with a sultry sexual charge. Richardson collaborated with other producers on the album, Guy Sigsworth on the song \\"New Shoes\\" and Jacknife Lee on \\"Ride The Pain\\". UK radio DJ Pete Tong supported \\"Avalon\\" on his show. Overall the album mixed old school electro and funk with modern-day pop sensibilities. In 2007 she collaborated with David Guetta on \\"Do Something Love\\" for his Pop Life album. Personal life In December 2012, Richardson and her husband Kyle Korver welcomed their first child, a girl named Kyra Elyse.Hawks' Kyle Korver Welcomes Baby Girl She gave birth their first son, Knox Elliot, on October 4, 2014.

Running roughly in an \\"L\\"-shaped pattern, SR 92 begins at SR 90 in Sierra Vista and ends at a traffic circle in Bisbee along SR 80, running entirely within Cochise County. The route was constructed and numbered as SR 92 in the late 1930s with a route that traveled further north past Sierra Vista than it does today. The routing was corrected in the 1960s. Route description SR 92 begins at an intersection with Fry Boulevard in Sierra Vista. SR 90 is the designation along the roads heading north and east from the intersection. From here, SR 92 heads south through Sierra Vista, passing by residential areas in a desert terrain. The road then passes through the town of Nicksville while the west side of the route is flanked by the Coronado National Forest, in which Huachuca Mountains are located. SR 92 then turns eastward, passing within several miles within the Mexico–United States border. The route passes the town of Palominas before turning northeast. The roadway enters the town of Bisbee, meeting its terminus at a traffic circle in the city. The highway is maintained by the Arizona Department of Transportation (ADOT), which is responsible for maintaining SR 92 like all other highways around the state. As part of this role, ADOT periodically surveys traffic along its routes. These surveys are most often presented in the form of average annual daily traffic, which is the number of vehicles who use the route on any average day during the year. In 2009, ADOT calculated that around as few as 3,700 vehicles used the route daily near Palominas and as many as 31,000 daily near the northern terminus at Sierra Vista. No part of the highway has been listed in the National Highway System, a system of roads in the United States important to the nation's economy, defense, and mobility. History The highway was designated in 1936, originating at SR 82 in Whetstone and heading south into Sierra Vista. From there, it turned east for a stretch and then turned south following its current route to Bisbee. At this time, the section of the route corresponding to the current routing was paved, while the northern section was still a gravel road. The northern section was improved in 1942. In 1961, SR 90 took over the segment of SR 92 north of Sierra Vista, leaving SR 92 to the section south of the city and east to Bisbee. Since then, the routing has not been modified.

The gorge is around 4 km in length of which 1 km is accessible to visitors by means of wooden walkways (closed in winter months). It has a depth of up to 300m and in some places is only a few meters wide. At the end of the gorge is a waterfall. It receives around 100,000 visitors a year. Waterfall in the Gorge The waters of the Großarler Ache, a mountain stream, formed the gorge over thousands of years. In 1875 work began by members of the Pongau Alpine Club to make the gorge accessible, however was unfinished due to a lack of funds. Prince Johann II. of Liechtenstein, who ran a hunting lodge in the nearby Großarl, donated 600 guilders for an expansion of the work. At the completion of work in 1876 the gorge was renamed to honour the generous donation from the Prince. According to legend, the gorge was created when the devil full of anger and rage over a failed plan, flew across the canyon throwing water into it with such force as to carve the rock.

It is home to the Macon Mayhem, a minor-league hockey team in the Southern Professional Hockey League. The Centerplex was previously home to the Macon Whoopee (ECHL), Macon Whoopee (CHL) and Macon Trax ice hockey teams and also the Macon Knights arena football team. Seating 7,182 for hockey and arena football and up to 9,252 for concerts. History Macon Centreplex was built in 1968 as the first facility of its size and kind in the state. Mayor Ronnie Thompson was among its most influential backers. Thompson, who served from 1967-1975, blocked an appearance at the facility by the boxer Muhammad Ali because the mayor objected to Ali's Conscientious Objector status during the Vietnam War. The Centreplex quickly became Central Georgia's premier sports, entertainment and trade show venue, with concerts by well-known performers such as Elvis Presley. Presley performed at the centreplex on April 15, 1972, afternoon show and evening show, April 24, 1975, August 31, 1976, and June 1, 1977.

The shows aired on Spike on November 3, 2011 and November 10, 2011. The arena underwent major renovations in 1996 including the addition of the Edgar H. Wilson Convention Centre, which hosts conventions, trade shows and banquets. Three luxury suites were added in 2003 and the Centreplex's exterior redone, resulting in the addition of a giant \\"M\\" at the main entrance on the arena.

The site offers news, satire, blogs and original content, and covers politics, business, entertainment, environment, technology, popular media, lifestyle, culture, comedy, healthy living, women's interests and local news featuring columnists. It has been described as mostly liberal-leaning. Founded by Andrew Breitbart, Arianna Huffington, Kenneth Lerer, and Jonah Peretti, the site was launched on May 9, 2005 as counterpart to the conservative news site Drudge Report. In March 2011, it was acquired by AOL for US$315 million, making Arianna Huffington editor-in-chief. In June 2015, Verizon Communications acquired AOL for US$4.4 billion and the site became a part of Verizon Media. In 2012, the website became the first commercially run United States digital media enterprise to win a Pulitzer Prize. The site offers content posted directly on the site as well as user- generated content via video blogging, audio, and photo. History The Huffington Post was launched on May 9, 2005 as a commentary outlet, blog, and an alternative to news aggregators such as the Drudge Report. It was founded by Arianna Huffington, Andrew Breitbart, Kenneth Lerer, and Jonah Peretti. Prior to this, Arianna Huffington hosted the website Ariannaonline.com. Her first foray into the Internet was the website Resignation.com, which called for the resignation of President Bill Clinton and was a rallying place for conservatives opposing Clinton. An early Huffington Post strategy was crafting search engine optimized stories and headlines based around trending keywords, such as \\"What Time Is the Super Bowl?\\" In August 2006, Huffington Post raised a $5 million Series A round from SoftBank Capital and Greycroft. In December 2008, Huffington Post raised $25 million from Oak Investment Partners at a $100 million valuation and Fred Harman of Oak Investment Partners joined its board of directors. The money was to be used for technology, infrastructure, investigative journalism, and development of local versions. In June 2009, Eric Hippeau, co-managing partner of Softbank Capital, became CEO of HuffPost. In January 2011, the Huffington Post website received 35% of its traffic from web search engines, compared to 20% at CNN. This strategy appealed to AOL CEO Tim Armstrong, who tried to implement similar SEO-driven journalism practices at AOL at the time of its acquisition of Huffington Post. In March 2011, AOL acquired Huffington Post for 315 million. As part of the deal, Arianna Huffington became president and editor-in-chief of Huffington Post and existing AOL properties Engadget, TechCrunch, Moviefone, MapQuest, Black Voices, PopEater (now HuffPost Celebrity), AOL Music, AOL Latino (now HuffPost Voices), AutoBlog, Patch, and StyleList. The Huffington Post subsumed many of AOL's Voices properties, including AOL Black Voices, which was established in 1995 as Blackvoices.com, and AOL Latino, Impact (launched in 2010 as a partnership between Huffington Post and Causecast), Women, Teen, College, Religion, and the Spanish-language Voces (en español). The Voices brand was expanded in September 2011 with the launch of Gay Voices, dedicated to LGBT- relevant articles. By late 2013, the website operated as a \\"stand-alone business\\" within AOL, taking control of more of its own business and advertising operations, and directing more effort towards securing \\"premium advertising\\". In June 2015, Verizon Communications acquired AOL for US$4.4 billion and the site became a part of Verizon Media. Arianna Huffington resigned to pursue other ventures, and in December 2016 was succeeded as editor-in-chief by Lydia Polgreen. In April 2017, Polgreen announced the company would rebrand, changing its official full name to HuffPost, with changes also to the design of its website and logo and content and reporting. On January 24, 2019, 20 employees were laid off as a part of Verizon Media laying off 7% of its staff. The opinion and health sections were eliminated. Pulitzer Prize finalist Jason Cherkis lost his job.

Criticism and controversy=Unpaid bloggers The site originally published work from both paid reporters and unpaid bloggers. In February 2011, Visual Art Source, which had been cross-posting material from its website, went on strike against HuffPost to protest its writers not being paid. In March 2011, the strike and the call to boycott was joined and endorsed by the National Writers Union and NewsGuild-CWA; however, the boycott was dropped in October 2011. In April 2011, HuffPost was targeted with a multimillion-dollar lawsuit by Jonathan Tasini on behalf of thousands of uncompensated bloggers. On March 30, 2012, the suit was dismissed with prejudice by the court, holding that the bloggers had volunteered their services, their compensation being publication. In 2015, Wil Wheaton stated that he refused to allow his work to be reused for free on the site. The practice of publishing blog posts from unpaid contributors ended in January 2018. This transformed the site, which had become notable for featuring extensive sections in broad range of subjects from a significant number of contributors. Some of the contributors included: * Arianna Huffington * Barack Obama on politics * Robert Reich on politics * On February 17, 2016, Catherine, Duchess of Cambridge (Kate Middleton) guest- edited articles to bring attention to mental health issues affecting young people. * Harry Shearer on life issues * Jeff Pollack on music * Roy Sekoff on politics * Craig Taro Gold, spiritual author * Jeff Halevy on health * Cenk Uygur * Diane Ravitch on education * Jacob M.

Steven Novella, president of the New England Skeptical Society, criticized HuffPost for allowing homeopathy proponent Dana Ullman to have a blog on the site.  Apology by the South African edition  In April 2017, HuffPost South Africa was directed by the press ombud to apologize unreservedly for publishing and later defending a column calling for disenfranchisement of white men which was declared malicious, inaccurate and discriminatory hate speech.  Jeffrey Epstein  In July 2019, HuffPost was criticized for publishing a story written by Rachel Wolfson, a publicist, that praised Jeffrey Epstein. Editors later removed the article at the author's request. Political stance HuffPost has been described as a mostly liberal or liberal-leaning magazine, although there is a perception that it defends the centrist establishment of the Democratic Party.Budak, Ceren and Goel, Sharad and Rao, Justin M., Fair and Balanced? Quantifying Media Bias through Crowdsourced Content Analysis (November 17, 2014). Available on ssrn.com or dx.doi.org Commenting in 2012 on increased conservative engagement on the website despite its reputation as a liberal news source, HuffPost founder Arianna Huffington stated that her website is \\"increasingly seen\\" as an Internet newspaper that is \\"not positioned ideologically in terms of how we cover the news\\". According to Michael Steel, press secretary for Republican Speaker of the House John Boehner, Republican aides \\"engage with liberal websites like The Huffington Post [anyway, if for] no other reason than [because] they drive a lot of cable coverage\\". Jon Bekken, journalism professor at Suffolk University, has cited The Huffington Post as an example of an \\"advocacy newspaper\\". The Wall Street Journal editor James Taranto has mockingly referred to it as the \\"Puffington Host\\", while Rush Limbaugh has referred to it as the \\"Huffing and Puffington Post\\". During the 2016 United States presidential election, HuffPost regularly appended an editor's note to the end of stories about candidate Donald Trump, reading: \\"Donald Trump regularly incites political violence and is a serial liar, rampant xenophobe, racist, misogynist and birther who has repeatedly pledged to ban all Muslims—1.6 billion members of an entire religion—from entering the U.S.\\" After Trump was elected on November 8, 2016, HuffPost ended this practice.

The team moved to Market Square Arena in 1974. In 1976, the Pacers became a franchise in the National Basketball Association (NBA) when the ABA merged with the NBA. The Pacers returned for a night when they played their first pre-season game of the 2008–09 season at the Pepsi Coliseum on October 8, 2008, hosting the then-New Orleans Hornets. 7,439 people watched the Pacers lose to the Hornets 105–71. The Pacers wore uniforms based on the 1967 to 1971 uniform design. Former ABA Pacers George McGinnis, Darnell Hillman, Bob Netolicky, Don Buse, Jerry Harkness, Steve Green, Tom Thacker, Bill Newton, and Wayne Pack, attended the game and were recognized during a halftime ceremony. During the game's first quarter, former Championship Pacers coach and current radio commentator Slick Leonard sat on the Pacers' bench as head coach, while then-head coach Jim O'Brien joined Mark Boyle for the radio broadcast. Ice hockey The Indianapolis Capitals of the American Hockey League played at the Coliseum from 1939 to 1952, winning the Calder Cup in 1942 and 1950.

The Indiana Ice of the United States Hockey League played at the Coliseum from 2004 to 2012, leaving due to the renovation. The Ice won the USHL's Clark Cup in 2009 while playing in the building. They did not return to the Coliseum upon the venue reopening, opting for withdrawal from competition or dormancy until another venue could be secured. Since 2014 the Indy Fuel hockey team has played in the arena. The Fuel are an ECHL team affiliated with the Chicago Blackhawks. The Coliseum hosted the American Hockey League's Calder Cup Final in 1942, 1943 and 1950; the International Hockey League's Turner Cup Final in 1957, 1958 and 1990; the Central Hockey League's Adams Cup Final in 1982, 1983 and 1984; and the United States Hockey League's Clark Cup Final in 2009. Eight of Indianapolis' nine hockey championship teams called the Coliseum home. The other was the 2014 Indiana Ice, who split their schedule between Bankers Life Fieldhouse and Pan Am Pavilion. Other sports teams and events The finals of the 1942–43 – 1944–45 Indiana High School Boys Basketball Tournaments were held at the Coliseum. On January 25, 2019, the Horizon League announced its Men's and Women's Basketball Championships would take place at the Coliseum, starting March 9–10, 2020.

These open cupboards typically had between one and three display tiers, and at the time, a drawer or multiple drawers fitted to them. The word cupboard gradually came to mean a closed piece of furniture.Andrews, John (2006) British Antique Furniture. Antique Collectors' Club ; p. 226 Types of cupboards=Airing cupboard An airing cupboard is a built-in storage space, sometimes of walk-in dimensions, containing a water heater, either an immersion heater for hot running water or a boiler for central heating water (hence, also \\"boiler cupboard\\"), or a hot water storage tank. Shelves, usually slatted to allow for circulation of heat, are positioned above or around the heater to provide room for clothing. The purpose is to allow air to circulate around the stored fabrics to prevent damp forming. Some variants of airing cupboards also serve as the linen cupboard, the storing area of the household's clean sheets and towels. In another version, the airing cupboard serves as a temporary drying space, either for laundry or for wet outdoor clothes and shoes. Its shelves can be used to fully remove traces of damp from dried clothing before the items are put away elsewhere in drawers and wardrobes. A moveable electrical version of this is a drying cabinet. Built-in cupboard A built-in cupboard is a storage space that forms part of the design of the room and is not free-standing or moveable. It is not the same as a cabinet. In the United Kingdom houses often have a built-in cupboard under the stairs. Linen cupboard A linen cupboard is an enclosed recess of a room used for storing household linen (e.g. sheets, towels, tablecloths) and other things for storage, usually with shelves, or a free-standing piece of furniture for this purpose. Stationery cupboard Most offices have a lockable repository for valuables. The heart of this is usually the supply of stationery.

He was primarily known for his promotion of White separatism, National Socialism, antisemitism, and Holocaust denial. Schmidt was arrested in Germany on hate charges in 1995, but avoided standing trial by returning to the USA while released on bail. Early life Schmidt was born on 24 April 1927, in Völklingen. During Nazi rule, he was a member of the Hitler Youth, and, by his own account, joined the Waffen-SS in 1943 at the age of 16, and served as a corporal in the SS Division Leibstandarte. Schmidt was wounded twice during campaigns in Hungary, Austria, and the Battle of the Bulge. He left Germany in 1947, arrived in the United States in 1949, and became a naturalized citizen in 1955 in Chicago.  Political activism = GANPAC  In 1983, Schmidt founded the German-American National Political Action Committee (GANPAC), which published the GANPAC Brief in English and the USA-Bericht ([U.S.A. Report]) in German. GANPAC was characterized as \\"pretending to represent the 52 million Americans of German descent\\" by the German magazine Der Spiegel, as \\"openly anti-Semitic\\" by The New York Times, and as \\"virulently anti-Semitic\\" by the Anti-Defamation League. GANPAC was also accused of promoting Holocaust denial. Between 1983 and 1985, GANPAC raised about $55,000 in contributions, but, unlike other political action committees, did not make any financial contributions until the late 1980s, when it began donating money to the election campaigns of conservative Republican candidates. When U.S. Senator Steve Symms gave a $1,000 contribution from GANPAC to the Anti-Defamation League of B'nai B'rith and the Idaho Holocaust Council, Schmidt complained to the Federal Election Commission. GANPAC also made a contribution to Democrat Bob Edgar who was running against Jewish Republican candidate Arlen Specter. The Santa Monica offices of GANPAC were fire-bombed in 1985, causing $50,000 in damage. Schmidt claimed the Jewish Defense League carried out the attack, a claim the JDL rejected. The GANPAC Brief was published out of Washington, D.C. (1983-1989), Santa Monica, California (1990-1993), Burke, Virginia (January–March 1994), and Pensacola, Florida (April 1994-July 2004).  GIEA  Schmidt also founded the German-American Information and Education Association (GIEA), which is presided over by E. Stanley Rittenhouse, a known anti-Semite, who \\"served as chief legislative representative for the Liberty Lobby, a far right organization founded by Willis Carto, whom the Anti- Defamation League calls \\"perhaps the most influential professional anti-Semite in the United States\\".  National Alliance  In one of his last speeches, William Luther Pierce briefly discussed a longtime friendship with Hans Schmidt. Arrest On 9 August 1995 Schmidt was arrested at the Frankfurt airport by German authorities after copies of his newsletter, USA-Bericht, were discovered. He was charged with \\"incitement to hate\\" (Volksverhetzung in German) as a result of a letter he had sent to a German state legislator in Schwerin. Schmidt came to regard the German government as treasonous and controlled by \\"Oberjuden\\" (\\"top Jews\\"), and claimed the U.S. embassy provided false information to Germany to persecute him. The ADL applauded his arrest. Due to poor health, he was released on bail in January 1996. He fled Germany and returned to the US to avoid further persecution. He wrote a book about this experience, titled Jailed in 'Democratic' Germany (1997). Later life and death Schmidt continued anti-Semitic campaigns, first by calling for a repeal of the Kosher tax (specifically addressing the Adolph Coors Brewing Co.), and later by writing a book entitled End Times/End Games (1999) where he listed all the ways \\"Aryans\\" were more accomplished than Jews and begged all Jews to voluntarily leave white-majority countries on their own accord. His influence waned as his friend Ernst Zundel's career withered, and he died in 2010. He had no known survivors.  Quotations  *In a postcard, GANPAC claimed that \\"Jews were not gassed by the Nazis ... the numbers and reports of predetermined extermination are greatly exaggerated by professional liars\\". *According to the German Verfassungsschutz, Schmidt, protected by US law, was very outspoken in his publications and cites an example from The Jewish Question in 20th Century in America\\": \\"In the last 200 years, European observers have noted that the Jews are not interested in 'Equality of the Races' but in destroying the white Race.\\" *The 1996 annual report of the Verfassungsschutz of Lower Saxony, quotes from an issue of USA-Bericht: \\"What I dislike most about Jews is their apparent deep dishonesty. [...] An outstanding example for this deep dishonesty of most of the Jews [...] is the constant denial of Jewish excessive power [...] [It is] of course indispensable that the Jews are pampered in Germany, just as in nature, it is a parasite's due.\\" Writings * Jailed in 'Democratic' Germany: The Ordeal of an American Writer (1997).

He held political offices, the most important being Lord President of the Council of Wales and the Marches. He became very wealthy and was a benefactor of a number of institutions. He was a co-founder of Brasenose College, Oxford and endowed a grammar school in the village of his birth in Lancashire. Early life and education Smyth was born in the south Lancashire village of Farnworth in the parish of Prescot, which now falls within the town of Widnes in the Borough of Halton. Smyth was the fourth son of Robert Smyth of Peel Hall.Poole, p21Fishwick, Henry; Ditchfield, P. H. (Peter Hampson) (1909).

Smyth went to the University of Oxford.Alumni Oxonienses 1500-1714, Smith-Sowton His college is uncertain, being either Oriel or Lincoln, or both in succession. In 1476 he gained the degree of bachelor of canon law and by 1492 he had received the degree of bachelor of civil law. Ecclesiastical life On 24 September 1485, one month after the battle of Bosworth and the consequent accession to the throne of Henry VII, Smyth was given the benefice of the deanery of Wimborne, Dorset, where Lady Margaret's parents were buried. On 20 October 1485 he was made a canon and prebendary of St Stephen's Chapel in the Palace of Westminster, where he became dean in 1490. He later obtained the livings of Combe Martin, Devon, of Great Grimsby and on 14 June 1492 he was instituted as rector of Cheshunt, Hertfordshire.Poole, p25 It is not possible to be sure about all his preferments because of his common name. On 1 October 1492 he became bishop of Coventry and Lichfield and was consecrated on 3 February 1493 by Archbishop Morton. On 6 November 1496 he was translated to the diocese of Lincoln.Fryde, et al., p. 256 Political life On 20 September 1485 Smyth gained a place in the Court of Chancery as keeper of the hanaper which gave him a salary for life.Poole, p. 23 In 1486 he obtained a grant for the custody of the daughters of Edward IV. In 1493 Smyth was appointed a member of Prince Arthur's Council of Wales and the Marches. In 1500 he was made Chancellor of the University of Oxford. Prince Arthur died in April 1502 and in August of that year Smyth became Lord President of the Council, giving him full responsibility for the exercise of royal power in Wales. He continued to hold this post until at least 1512 or, possibly, until his death. By August 1502 he was no longer Chancellor of Oxford University. Philanthropy In November 1495 Smyth refounded the hospital of St John the Baptist in Lichfield and added to it a school for poor children. In 1500 he founded the Cuerdley Chapel which was added to the south aisle of St Luke's Church, Farnworth for the use of his tenants from Cuerdley. The nearby village of Cuerdley was the seat of the very ancient Smith family of Cuerdley his armorial progenitorsReade, Compton (1904).

Around the same time he and Sir Richard Sutton set out to found a new college in Oxford. They rebuilt Brasenose Hall, added other existing halls to it, and having obtained a charter in 1512, called it \\"The King's haule and college of Brasennose\\". This is now Brasenose College. Smyth's intention at the college was to benefit clergy from the north of England. The twelve fellows of the college were to have been born in the diocese of Coventry and Lichfield, or to have come from Lancashire, and particularly from the area of his birthplace. He gave to the college his lands of Cold Norton and, by his will, a considerable legacy of lands, plate, vestments, manuscripts and books. Reputation and legacy Smyth's ecclesiastical, legal and political duties resulted in his having a very busy life, only at times being resident in his diocese. He was very wealthy and was described by Hugh Latimer as being one of the \\"unpreaching prelates\\"; no sermons by him survive. He indulged in nepotism. Matthew Smyth was the first principal of Brasenose College, a William Smyth was archdeacon of Northampton and then of Lincoln and another William Smyth was appointed to St John's Hospital at Lichfield. William Smyth died on 2 January 1514 at Buckden Palace, now in Cambridgeshire, one of the residences of the bishops of Lincoln. In addition to bequests to Brasenose College and Lincoln Cathedral, he made provision for a hospital at Banbury. He is buried in Lincoln Cathedral.

Over the next several years, more than $500,000 in WPA funds and more than a million adobe bricks were used for the construction of buildings. It took much longer than expected, finishing in 1957, seventeen years after construction began. Though the Coliseum took nearly two decades to complete, the rest of the fairgrounds did not take nearly as long, which enabled the State Fair to reopen in 1938. The Coliseum was dedicated at the opening of the 1957 New Mexico State Fair and was named in honor of Governor Tingley. Roy Rogers and Dale Evans played the entire run of that year's nine-day Fair. Notable events Tingley Coliseum is used for a myriad of civic gatherings, beyond the State Fair, including concerts, sporting events, and ice shows. Entertainers who have appeared at Tingley include Garth Brooks, Shakira, WWE, Wham!, UFC, The Kinks, Mötley Crüe, Ronnie James Dio, Quiet Riot, Dokken, Janet Jackson, Tom Petty and the Heartbreakers, Neil Young, Pearl Jam, AC/DC, Iron Maiden (1982), Metallica, KISS, Bob Dylan, Gloria Estefan, Jay-Z, Van Halen, Iron Maiden, Tool, Rush, Aerosmith, James Brown, Elton John, Cher, Ozzy Osbourne, Fleetwood Mac, Tina Turner, Eric Clapton, No Doubt, Bon Jovi, The Beegees, The Jackson 5, Vinnie Vincent Invasion, Chris Brown, Earth, Wind and Fire, Red Hot Chili Peppers, Eric Church, Prince, Olivia Newton John and Elvis Presley among others. It also hosted the 1987 Miss USA pageant. Floyd Mayweather Jr. fought the second fight of his undefeated career at the Coliseum. The PBR held one of their signature Built Ford Tough Series (formerly Bud Light Cup) events, the Ty Murray Invitational, annually, from 1997 to 2008. As of 2009, the event was moved to The Pit, on the University of New Mexico campus.

He was founder, with William Smyth, bishop of Lincoln, of Brasenose College, Oxford, and the first lay founder of any college. He is said to have come of a north-country family, the Suttons near Macclesfield, Cheshire. Little is known of his life, but he was a barrister, and in 1499 a member of the privy council. In 1513 he became steward of the monastery of Sion, a house of Brigittine nuns at Isleworth. How Smyth and Sutton came to plan a college is not known, but in 1508 we find Edmund Croston, or Crofton, bequeathing £6, 13s. 4d. towards the building of \\"a college of Brasynnose\\" if the projects of \\"the bishop of Lincoln and master Sotton\\" were carried into effect within a stipulated period. In the same year Sutton obtained a ninety-two year lease of Brasenose Hall and Little University Hall for £3 per annum, and from that time until the end of his life was occupied in purchasing estates with which he might endow the new college. He is thought to have contributed to the funds of Corpus Christi College, Oxford, as well. He was knighted some years before his death, which occurred about 1524.

Biography Horst Tappert was born on 26 May 1923 in Elberfeld (now Wuppertal), Germany. His father, Julius Tappert (1892–1957), was a civil servant; his mother was Ewaldine Röll Tappert (1892–1981). Following high school and at the age of 17, Tappert was drafted into the German Army during World War II. Aged 19 he was, according to his widow against his will, transferred from the Army to the Waffen-SS, where the author of the Derrick series, Herbert Reinecker, had also served; initially a member of a reserve anti-aircraft unit in Arolsen, he was listed as a grenadier with the 3rd SS Division Totenkopf in March 1943. In 1945 he was briefly a prisoner of war in Seehausen, Altmark. Following the war, he was hired as a bookkeeper at a theatre in Stendal, Germany, and became interested in acting. He took acting classes and gave his stage debut in Stendal, playing Dr. Stribel in Paul Helwig's Die Flitterwochen. In the following years, he changed employers several times and, in 1956, started working at the Kammerspiele, Munich. An independent actor since 1967, he worked as an actor until he died. In the late 1950s, Tappert started taking part in movie and television productions. His big breakthrough was in 1966 with the three-part television show Die Gentlemen bitten zur Kasse, in which he played train robber Michael Donegan. In 1968, he changed sides by playing Scotland Yard detective Perkins in Edgar Wallace movies. When the second public television station in Germany, the ZDF, started planning a new mystery series with a different type of investigator in 1973, he was chosen for the character of detective Stephan Derrick, with sidekick assistant Harry Klein (played by Fritz Wepper). The character of Stephan Derrick became a cult figure. The series was licensed in 104 countries and was popular with the Chinese, Japanese, and Italians (and even Pope John Paul II). The last of 281 episodes was filmed in 1998, when Tappert reached his self- imposed age limit of 75 years for being a television actor. Personal life Divorced twice, he last lived in Gräfelfing near Munich with his third wife, Ursula Pistor (married in 1957). He was the father of three children. Tappert enjoyed fishing and hunting. He had a summer holiday home on the coast of northern Norway, a country where he also became a popular visitor as Derrick as well as a private person. Tappert and his wife Ursula had a cabin in Hamarøy municipality in Nordland from 1990 to 2008 when, due to his age and failing health, they had to sell the cabin. His wife Ursula Pistor is also an actor, a graduate of the same acting school in Berlin as Ellinor Hamsun, daughter of Knut Hamsun. In interviews and his memoirs, Tappert did not elaborate on his World War II career, claiming to have served as a company medic in the Wehrmacht, after which he became a prisoner of war. In April 2013 it was revealed that he had joined the infamous 3. SS-Panzergrenadier-Division Totenkopf, then deployed on the Eastern Front, in March 1943. Historian Jan Erik Schulte, an expert on the history of the SS, said that the circumstances of Tappert's membership of the SS and the question of whether he was pressured or coerced into joining remain unclear. Tappert died on 13 December 2008 in Planegg, Germany.

Historia de la conquista de México. Madrid: 1684. Antonio de Solís y Ribadeneyra (18 July 161019 April 1686) was a Spanish dramatist and historian. His work includes drama, poetry, and prose, and he has been considered one of the last great writers of Spanish Baroque literature. He was born at Alcalá de Henares (or, less probably, Plasencia). He studied law at Salamanca, where he produced a comedy entitled Amour and Obligation, which was acted in 1627. He became secretary to the count of Oropesa, and in 1654 he was appointed secretary of state as well as private secretary to Philip IV. Later he obtained the lucrative post of chronicler of the Indies, and, on taking orders in 1667 severed his connexion with the stage. He died at Madrid on 19 April 1686. His Work Of his ten extant plays, two have some place in the history of the drama. El Amor al uso was adapted by Scarron and again by Thomas Corneille as L'Amour de la mode, while La Gitanilla de Madrid, itself founded on the novela of Cervantes, has been utilized directly or indirectly by Pius Alexander Wolff, Victor Hugo and Longfellow. The titles of the remaining seven are Triumph from Armor and Fortune, Eurídice y Orfeo, The Alcetzar del secretion, The Amazons, The Doctor Carlino, Un bobo hace ciento and Defend the Enemy. Amor y obligación survives in a manuscript at the Biblioteca Nacional. The Historia de la conquista de México, población y progresos de la América septentrional, conocida por el nombre de Nueva España, covering the three years between the appointment of Cortés to command the invading force and the fall of the city, deservedly ranks as a Spanish prose classic. It was first published in 1684 in Spain. French and Italian translations were published by the 1690s, and an English translation by Townshend appeared in 1724. The book was extremely popular on both sides of the Atlantic and was known to important figures in colonial Latin America and the British colonies. It remained the most important European source on Latin American history up through the first part of the nineteenth century.

Simple functions are sufficiently \\"nice\\" that using them makes mathematical reasoning, theory, and proof easier. For example, simple functions attain only a finite number of values. Some authors also require simple functions to be measurable; as used in practice, they invariably are. A basic example of a simple function is the floor function over the half-open interval [1, 9), whose only values are {1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8}. A more advanced example is the Dirichlet function over the real line, which takes the value 1 if x is rational and 0 otherwise. (Thus the \\"simple\\" of \\"simple function\\" has a technical meaning somewhat at odds with common language.) All step functions are simple. Simple functions are used as a first stage in the development of theories of integration, such as the Lebesgue integral, because it is easy to define integration for a simple function and also it is straightforward to approximate more general functions by sequences of simple functions. Definition Formally, a simple function is a finite linear combination of indicator functions of measurable sets. More precisely, let (X, Σ) be a measurable space. Let A1, ..., An ∈ Σ be a sequence of disjoint measurable sets, and let a1, ..., an be a sequence of real or complex numbers. A simple function is a function f: X \\\\to \\\\mathbb{C} of the form :f(x)=\\\\sum_{k=1}^n a_k {\\\\mathbf 1}_{A_k}(x), where {\\\\mathbf 1}_A is the indicator function of the set A. Properties of simple functions The sum, difference, and product of two simple functions are again simple functions, and multiplication by constant keeps a simple function simple; hence it follows that the collection of all simple functions on a given measurable space forms a commutative algebra over \\\\mathbb{C}. Integration of simple functions If a measure μ is defined on the space (X,Σ), the integral of f with respect to μ is :\\\\sum_{k=1}^na_k\\\\mu(A_k), if all summands are finite. Relation to Lebesgue integration Any non-negative measurable function f\\\\colon X \\\\to\\\\mathbb{R}^{+} is the pointwise limit of a monotonic increasing sequence of non-negative simple functions. Indeed, let f be a non-negative measurable function defined over the measure space (X, \\\\Sigma,\\\\mu) as before. For each n\\\\in\\\\mathbb N, subdivide the range of f into 2^{2n}+1 intervals, 2^{2n} of which have length 2^{-n}. For each n, set :I_{n,k}=\\\\left[\\\\frac{k-1}{2^n},\\\\frac{k}{2^n}\\\\right) for k=1,2,\\\\ldots,2^{2n}, and I_{n,2^{2n}+1}=[2^n,\\\\infty). (Note that, for fixed n, the sets I_{n,k} are disjoint and cover the non-negative real line.) Now define the measurable sets :A_{n,k}=f^{-1}(I_{n,k}) \\\\, for k=1,2,\\\\ldots,2^{2n}+1. Then the increasing sequence of simple functions :f_n=\\\\sum_{k=1}^{2^{2n}+1}\\\\frac{k-1}{2^n}{\\\\mathbf 1}_{A_{n,k}} converges pointwise to f as n\\\\to\\\\infty. Note that, when f is bounded, the convergence is uniform. This approximation of f by simple functions (which are easily integrable) allows us to define an integral f itself; see the article on Lebesgue integration for more details.  References  *.

The action spectra of chlorophyll molecules are slightly modified in vivo depending on specific pigment-protein interactions. An action spectrum is a graph of the rate of biological effectiveness plotted against wavelength of light. It is related to absorption spectrum in many systems. Mathematically, it describes the inverse quantity of light required to evoke a constant response. It is very rare for an action spectrum to describe the level of biological activity, since biological responses are often nonlinear with intensity. Action spectra are typically written as unit-less responses with peak response of one, and it is also important to distinguish if an action spectrum refers to quanta at each wavelength (mol or log-photons), or to spectral power (W). It shows which wavelength of light is most effectively used in a specific chemical reaction. Some reactants are able to use specific wavelengths of light more effectively to complete their reactions. For example, chlorophyll is much more efficient at using the red and blue regions than the green region of the light spectrum to carry out photosynthesis. Therefore, the action spectrum graph would show spikes above the wavelengths representing the colours red and blue. The first action spectrum was made by T. W. Engelmann, who split light into its components by the prism and then illuminated Cladophora placed in a suspension of aerobic bacteria. He found that bacteria accumulated in the region of blue and red light of the split spectrum. He thus discovered the effect of the different wavelengths of light on photosynthesis and plotted the first action spectrum of photosynthesis. Further examples include suppression of melatonin by wavelength and a variety of hazard functions, related to tissue damage from visible and near-visible light.

A leading member of the Norwich School of painters, he was elected vice-president of the Norwich Society of Artists in 1828 and became their president in 1829. He had wealthy patrons and was consistently praised by the Norfolk press for his successful London career. Stark was born in Norwich, the youngest son of an important dye manufacturer, Michael Stark, who is credited with the invention of the dye known as 'Norwich red'. On the completion of his education at Norwich School in 1811, he was apprenticed to John Crome, whose influence on his pupil was profound. His work was exhibited in London as early as 1811 and at the British Institution from 1814–18. In 1814 he moved away from Norwich to London, where he befriended the artist William Collins. In 1819 ill health forced him to return to Norwich, where lived for twenty years, before moving to Windsor in 1840, where he continued to produce landscapes. He returned to London in 1849, residing there until his death in 1859 at the age of 64. He is buried in the Rosary Cemetery in Norwich. Stark generally worked in oils, although his total output included etchings, watercolours and pencil and chalk drawings. His landscapes paintings often depicting woodland scenes that were pastiches of the seventeenth century Dutch masters. His works during the 1830s were more successful, and displayed a freshness that was previously lacking. In 1834 he published his admired Scenery of the Rivers of Norfolk, which consisted of thirty-six etchings produced by specialist engravers after his own paintings. This ambitious work was well-received at the time, but as with similar works published by other artists, it was financially unsuccessful. Life=Early life and apprenticeship to Crome St Michael Coslany, Norwich, where James Stark was baptised James Stark was born in Norwich on 19 November 1794, the son of Michael Stark (1748–1831) and his wife Jane Ivory. He was christened on 30 November 1794 at the Church of St Michael Coslany, Norwich, close to the family home.James Stark in \\"Parish registers, 1550–1900\\", FamilySearch ([Archdeacons transcripts for Norwich parishes, 1600–1812 James Stark]). James was the youngest son of eight siblings. His father Michael Stark was a Scottish-born dyer who had a considerable literary and scientific background, and who ran his own dyeing business on Duke Street, Norwich. Dye Works, Duke's Palace Bridge, a lithograph on paper by Stark depicting his father's dye works in Norwich. He is credited with a number of innovations in the dyeing industry, including the invention of the formula of 'Norwich red'.The Sessional Papers of the House of Lords, in the Session 1840, p. 304. James Stark showed a talent for art from an early age. He was educated at Norwich School, where he became friends with John Berney Crome, the son of the artist (and his teacher) John Crome. Two of Stark's pencil drawings were exhibited in Norwich in 1809, and he exhibited for the first time in London in 1811, at the age of seventeen, when his painting A view on King Street river, Norwich was shown at the Royal Academy. Because of his poor health, which dogged him throughout his life, his initial ambitions to become a farmer were never realised. In 1811 he was apprenticed for three years to John Crome. Two letters from Crome to his teenage pupil survive. One, dated 3 July 1814 and sent to Starks' house in London, contains a reminder to submit work to the Norwich Society of Artists' forthcoming exhibition. The second letter is considered by art historians to be important, as it reveals how Crome was able to impart his knowledge to his pupils. Amongst other suggestions, the letter encouraged Stark to consider using more \\"breadth\\". Crome was a strong influence on Stark, who was his favourite pupil, and Crome's preoccupation with depicting trees and woodland scenes led Stark to produce many such scenes himself. He was elected as a member of the Norwich Society of Artists in 1812. He exhibited at the British Institution between 1814 and 1818, winning a prize of £50 in 1818. Artistic career Margaret Carpenter, Norfolk Museums Collections In 1814, following the end of his Norwich apprenticeship, Stark moved to London. There he befriended and became influenced by the artist William Collins. In 1817 he became a student at the Royal Academy. The Bathing Place, Morning was sold in 1817 to the Henry Hobart, the Dean of Windsor. For a short period he shared lodgings with the portrait painter Joseph Clover. During this period he began to sell paintings to wealthy patrons: both the Marquis of Stafford and the Countess de Grey bought works from him. After only two years of study in London, debilitating ill health forced him to return to Norwich, where he remained for nearly twenty years, until his final move from the city in 1830. There he devoted himself to painting the scenery around the city and executing a series of paintings of Norfolk rivers, which were eventually engraved and published in 1834. Regarded during his lifetime by his friends as one of the leaders of the Norwich School of painters, he was elected Vice-President of the Norwich Society of Artists in 1828 and President in the following year, at a time when the Society was struggling to survive. In 1840 Stark moved to Windsor, where he lived for ten years. During this period in his life he painted many pictures of the scenery along the Thames and in Windsor Great Park, producing images of trees that revealed his improved understanding of their structure. Family life and final years On 7 July 1821 he married Elizabeth Younge Dinmore of King's Lynn. In 1830, he moved to London, taking up residence in Beaumont Row, Chelsea. Elizabeth Stark died in 1834, three years after the birth of their son, Arthur James Stark. He moved back to London in 1849 to further his son's artistic education, residing at Mornington Place, Camden Town. James Stark died in March 1859. His body was interred in the family burial plot in the Rosary Cemetery, Norwich. Development as an artist Stark mainly worked in oils, though he was also a watercolourist, and produced drawings in pencil and chalk. He initially followed his teacher John Crome in producing works with soft greys and pinks, in a style similar to that of Crome's Back of the New Mills (c. 1815). His first important success occurred the same year, when he exhibited The Bathing Place – Morning. His Lambeth, looking towards Westminster Bridge (1818), now in the Yale Center for British Art collection in New Haven, Connecticut, provides an indication of Stark's initial technique, which Andrew Hemingway describes as \\"a fairly broad style comparable with that of his fellow pupils\\". Stark's early paintings were followed by landscapes of a repetitive and stylized kind, generally depicting woodland glades, and for which he is generally best known today. These scenes fell into the trap of being \\"a mere pastiche of the seventeenth formula\\", containing ochre, red and green pigments to depict scenes containing poorly-drawn trees. Such works were exhibited under the title Landscape. By 1825, the London Magazine was reporting that Stark's subject matter lacked development, tending as he did to base his works on the paintings of seventeenth-century Dutch masters such as Meindert Hobbema and Jacob van Ruisdael. By the mid-1830s, Stark had moved away from the influence of the Dutch masters and was producing paintings that showed nature less heavily and more freely. These works have more descriptive titles. Not all his critics were pleased: the Norfolk Chronicle complained in 1829 of Stark's move away from depicting formulaic scenes towards a greater use of bright colours and more brilliant lighting effects. His work during this period in his artistic career became more successful, according to Hemingway. The numerous sketches of the Norfolk countryside he had previously produced gave his exhibited works a freshness that was previously lacking, and which was more appealing to the critics. Cromer, exhibited at the British Institution in 1837, is a good example of this new kind of work, and shows the influence of his friend William Collins and the Norwich artist John Thirtle. Like many of his later works, it is based on earlier sketchwork. Like many painters of the Norwich School, Stark produced his own etchings, but these were not exhibited. As they generally lacked a title, they are nowadays difficult to identify and are little known. Geoffrey Searle, in his survey of the etchings produced by the Norwich School, describes Stark's own etchings as \\"having a distinctive charm\\". The article on Stark in the 1911 Encyclopædia Britannica noted that \\"his works charm rather by their gentle truth and quietness of manner than by their robustness of view or by their decisiveness of execution\\". Exhibitions and publications James Stark exhibited paintings throughout his working life. The Norwich Society of Artists, which was inaugurated in 1803 and held annual exhibitions almost continuously until 1833, exhibited 105 works by Stark from 1809–32, of which seventy-three were landscapes and four were of marine scenes. During his career he had many wealthy patrons and was regarded in London as a successful provincial artist. He was consistently praised by the Norfolk press. In 1817, when only twenty- three, he and his friend John Berney Crome had been praised in the Norwich Mercury \\"for their great and rapid strides\\". As well as exhibiting in London and Norwich, Stark had his paintings shown in exhibitions as far afield as Glasgow, Edinburgh and Dublin. Stark wrote an essay On the moral and political influence of the Fine Arts, published in the Norwich Mercury on 26 May 1827, criticising those who were apparently indifferent towards the financial plight of the Norwich Society of Artists. Subsequent exhibitions of works by Stark include an exhibition held in 1887. (subscription required) Pupils Stark taught his own son Arthur, as well as Alfred Priest, Henry Jutsum and Samuel David Colkett, all of whom emerged to become minor artists.Cust, Dictionary of National Biography, 1885–1900, Volume 30. Their artistic styles were heavily influenced by their teacher, and none of them produced notable works of art. Arthur James Stark specialised in depicting landscapes and animals, and drew the cattle on a few of his father's pictures.

It is the location where the enamel, which covers the anatomical crown of a tooth, and the cementum, which covers the anatomical root of a tooth, meet. Informally it is known as the neck of the tooth. The border created by these two dental tissues has much significance as it is usually the location where the gingiva attaches to a healthy tooth by fibers called the gingival fibers. Active recession of the gingiva reveals the cementoenamel junction in the mouth and is usually a sign of an unhealthy condition. There exists a normal variation in the relationship of the cementum and the enamel at the cementoenamel junction. In about 60–65% of teeth, the cementum overlaps the enamel at the CEJ, while in about 30% of teeth, the cementum and enamel abut each other with no overlap.

Early life Beverley Jane Moxon was born in Morley, West Riding of Yorkshire on 28 March 1957 to Clive and Mavis Moxon. Clive was a baker and Mavis was a concert pianist. She has a younger sister called Stephanie. She attended Elmfield and Peel Street schools in Morley, and also Bruntcliffe High School in Morley. Career At the age of seven, Callard made her acting debut as Darius the page boy. After leaving school in 1973, she took a job as a shorthand typist. She later turned to acting and appeared on stage as Jaqui Coryton in Noël Coward's Hay Fever, Liz and Rita in Billy Liar and The Wicked Queen in Snow White. Callard made her television debut (as Beverley Sowden) in the Yorkshire Television soap Emmerdale Farm as Angie Richards in 1983. Other roles followed, including parts in Hinge & Bracket: Dear Ladies, Hells Bells, Will You Love Me Tomorrow and The Practice. She has released books and exercise videos called Real Results, Rapid Results, Ultimate Results and Lasting Results. She also appeared on GMTV and This Morning and has had a fitness page in the Daily Mirror. In 2000, she played the part of Barbara in the BBC sitcom The Peter Principle. In 2001, Callard was cast as Flo Henshaw in the BBC Three sitcom Two Pints of Lager and a Packet of Crisps and continued in the role for two years. During this time, she also guested on Sky1's Mile High. Between June and December 2010, Callard was a recurring panellist on ITV's talk show Loose Women. She was due to appear as the Wicked Queen in the Christmas pantomime Sleeping Beauty at the Lyceum Theatre, Sheffield, from December 2011, but had to withdraw from the production for undisclosed health reasons. She was subsequently replaced by her former Coronation Street co-star Margi Clarke. She made her return to the stage in 2012 playing Mari Hoff in a British touring production of The Rise and Fall of Little Voice. In 2019, she performed in a touring production of The Rocky Horror Picture Show at the Liverpool Empire. Coronation Street In 1984, Callard played Gail (Helen Worth) and Brian Tilsley's (Christopher Quinten) friend June Dewhurst in Coronation Street. In 1989, she returned to the series in the more significant role of Liz McDonald. Callard's first appearance as Liz aired on 27 October 1989. Callard's character of Liz McDonald has since been abused, a kidnap victim, a harassed mother and an unfaithful wife. Callard left Coronation Street in November 1998 to concentrate on her other career as an aerobics instructor and to spend more time with her family. In 2003, she returned to Coronation Street. In March 2011, Callard returned to Coronation Street having left for a short break in November 2010. Her last scenes before another exit were shown in April 2011 as she left Coronation Street, seemingly for good. In 30 May 2013, it was announced that she would return, again in the role of Liz McDonald; she returned on screen on 14 October 2013. In March 2016, Callard announced a two- month break from the series, as a result of her ongoing battle with clinical depression. She returned to filming in May 2016. In November 2019, Callard announced her departure from Coronation Street. Her final scenes will air in 2021. Personal life Aged 16, Callard, then pregnant, married Paul Atkinson in 1974. She later miscarried. Two years later, the couple had their first child, a daughter named Rebecca Callard, who later became an actress. A year later, the couple divorced, with Callard later recalling: \\"we were too young. He had an alcohol-induced violent side.\\" In 1980, Callard married David Sowden, an economics teacher. During the marriage, Callard had an abortion. In 1988, the couple separated amicably. Callard fell pregnant in 1989 to Steve Callard, and the couple married. Their son, Joshua was born in 1990. The pair separated due to Steve's infidelity, once occurring whilst Callard was recovering from cervical cancer treatment. In 2008, it was announced that Callard's pay, along with other Street stars, would be cut due to the credit crunch. She personally suffered the most, losing 40% of her earnings.\\"Callard's Corrie pay packet slashed\\" 13 August 2008, Digital Spy\\"More Corrie stars face large salary cuts\\" 17 August 2008, Digital Spy In 2016, Callard spoke about her nervous breakdown in 2009 and her depression. Callard now lives with her fourth husband, Jon McEwan, in Eccles, Salford, with McEwan's son Ben. They married on 30 October 2010, at the Hazelwood Castle Hotel, near Leeds.

Julius Stinde (28 August 1841 – 5 August 1905), German author, was born at Kirchnüchel in Holstein, the son of a clergyman. Having attended the gymnasium at Eutin, he was apprenticed in 1858 to a chemist in Lübeck. He soon tired of the shop, and went to study chemistry at Kiel and Giessen where he proceeded to the degree of PhD. In 1863 Stinde received an appointment as consulting chemist to a large industrial undertaking in Hamburg; but, becoming editor of the Hamburger Gewerbeblatt, he gradually transferred his energies to journalism. His earliest works were little comedies, dealing with Hamburg life, though he continued to make scientific contributions to various journals. In 1876 Stinde settled in Berlin and began the series of stories of the Buchholz family, vivid and humorous studies of Berlin middle-class life by which he is most widely known. He died at Olsberg. The first of the series Buchholzens in Italien (translated by HF Powell, 1887) appeared in 1883 and achieved an immense success. It was followed by Die Familie Buchholz in 1884 (translated by LD Schmitz, 1885); Frau Buchholz im Orient in 1888; Frau Wilhelmine (Der Familie Buchholz letzter Teil; translated by HF Powell, 1887) in 1886; Wilhelmine Buchholz Memoiren, in 1894; and Hotel Buchholz; Ausstellungserlebnisse der Frau Wilhelmine Buchholz, in 1896.

Arkive Distribution and habitat O. cataphractus is endemic to the Succulent Karoo biome in the Northern and the Western Cape provinces of South Africa, where it occurs from the southern Richtersveld to the Piketberg Mountains and the southern Tankwa Karoo. It inhabits rock outcrops and mountain slopes, preferably on sandstone substrate. Ecology=Diet The armadillo girdled lizard feeds mainly on small invertebrates, such as insects and spiders, but sometimes also may take plant material. In captivity, it is commonly fed crickets. In the wild, its most common prey items are termites, especially Microhodotermes viator and Hodotermes mossambicus. Behavior The armadillo girdled lizard is diurnal. It hides in rock cracks and crevices. It lives in social groups of up to 30 to 60 individuals of all ages, but usually fewer. Males are territorial, protecting a territory and mating with the females living there. In its defensive position it looks like an Ourobouros The armadillo girdled lizard possesses an uncommon antipredator adaptation, in which it takes its tail in its mouth and rolls into a ball when frightened. In this shape, it is protected from predators by the thick, squarish scales along its back and the spines on its tail. This behavior, which resembles that of the mammalian armadillo, gives it its English common names. Reproduction The female armadillo girdled lizard gives birth to one or two\\"Cordylus cataphracus \\". Animal Diversity Web live young; the species is one of the few lizards that does not lay eggs. The female may even feed her young, which is also unusual for a lizard. Females give birth once a year at most; some take a year off between births. Conservation The species Ouroborus cataphractus was classified by the IUCN as Vulnerable until 1996, but has since been downgraded to Least Concern. This is mostly due to a general cessation of collection for the pet trade, which was a significant drain on populations but is now illegal. The armadillo girdled lizard is thought to be somewhat susceptible to fluctuations in its primary foodsource (termites), which in turn can be impacted by climatic events such as changes in rainfall patterns, as well as to habitat changes through invasive alien plant species and poor fire management.

Stevens — the latter published a catalogue of the collectionPtolemy’s Geography: a brief account of all the printed editions down to 1730. The Life of Thomas Hariot and the \\"Hercules Club\\" \\"In the year 1877 the late Mr. Henry Stevens of Vermont, under the pseudonym of ' Mr. Secretary Outis,' projected and initiated a literary Association entitled THE HERCULES CLUB. The following extracts from the original prospectus of that year explain this platform: \\"The objects of this Association are literary, social, antiquarian, festive and historical ; and its aims are thoroughly independent research into the materials of early Anglo-American history and literature. The Association is known as THE HERCULES CLUB, whose Eurystheus is Historic Truth and whose appointed labours are to clear this field for the historian of the future.\\" The founders of the club believed that many valuable historical documents of the Age of Discovery still awaited publication and selected ten topics for which members would contribute research and writings. The ambitious list of topics which they selected for their initial publication were as follows: # Waymouth (Capt. George) Voyage to North Virginia in 1605. By James Rosier. London, 1605, 4° # Sil. Jourdan's Description of Barmuda. London, 1610, 4° # Lochinvar. Encouragements for such as shall have intention to bee Vndertakers in the new plantation of Cape Breton, now New Galloway. Edinburgh, 1625, 4° # Voyage into New England in 1623-24.. By Christopher Levett. London, 1628, 4° # Capt. John Smith's True Relation of such occurrences of Noate as hath hapned in Virginia. London, 1608, 4° # Gosnold's Voyage to the North part of Virginia in 1602. By John Brereton. London, 1602, 4° # A Plain Description of the Barmudas, now called Sommer Islands. London, 1613, 4° # For the Colony in Virginia Brittania, Lavves Divine Morall and Martiall, &c.; London, 1612, 4° # Capt. John Smith's Description of NewEngland, 16l4-15, map. London, 1616, 4° # Hariot (Thomas) Briefe and true report of the new found land of Virginia. London, 1588, 4° \\"The co-operative objects of the Association, however, appear never to have been fully inaugurated, although a large number of literary men, collectors, societies and libraries entered their names as Members of the Club. All were willing to give their pecuniary support as subscribers to the Club's publications, but few offered the more valuable aid of their literary assistance; hence practically the whole of the editing also devolved upon Mr. Henry Stevens. \\"He first took up No. 10 on the above list, Hariot's Virginia. His long and diligent study for the introduction thereto, resulted in the discovery of so much new and important matter relative to Hariot and Raleigh, that it became necessary to embody it in a separate volume, as the maximum dimensions contemplated for the introduction to each work had been exceeded tenfold or more.\\" On Stevens' death in 1886, the completion of the project devolved upon his son Henry N. Stevens who assessed the situation as follows: \\"Ever since 1886 I have from time to time unsuccessfully endeavoured to enlist the services of various editors competent to complete the projected eleven volumes of the Hercules Club publications, but after a lapse of nearly fourteen years I have awakened to the fact that no actual progress has been made, and that I have secured nothing beyond the vague promise of future assistance.\\" However all was not lost. Mr Stevens (Jr.) found that \\"On collating the printed stock I found that the two volumes, Hariot's Virginia and the Life of Hariot, were practically complete, the text of both all printed off, and the titles and preliminary leaves and the Index to Hariot's Virginia actually standing in type at the Chiswick Press just as my father left them fourteen years ago!\\" Thus it was not until 1900, almost 300 years after Hariot's death that the first serious biography appeared. Even so, the work was not widely distributed, only 162 copies had been printed and one of these deposited in the Harvard College Library. In 1972 the Burt Franklin Press, NYC, issued a reprint edition of the 'Life of Hariot\\" making it finally available to the literary public. And so 350 years after Hariot's death the true story of his life began slowly to appear.

They are involved in amelogenesis, the development of enamel. Amelogenins are type of extracellular matrix protein, which, together with ameloblastins, enamelins and tuftelins, direct the mineralization of enamel to form a highly organized matrix of rods, interrod crystal and proteins. Although the precise role of amelogenin(s) in regulating the mineralization process is unknown, it is known that amelogenins are abundant during amelogenesis. Developing human enamel contains about 70% protein, 90% of which are amelogenins.  Function  Amelogenins are believed to be involved in the organizing of enamel rods during tooth development. The latest research indicates that these proteins regulate the initiation and growth of hydroxyapatite crystals during the mineralization of enamel. In addition, amelogenins appear to aid in the development of cementum by directing cementoblasts to the tooth's root surface.  Variants  The amelogenin gene has been most widely studied in humans, where it is a single copy gene, located on the X and Y chromosomes at Xp22.1-Xp22.3 and Yp 11.2 [5]. The amelogenin gene’s location on sex chromosomes has implications for variability both between the X chromosome form (AMELX) and the Y chromosome form (AMELY), and between alleles of AMELY among different populations. This is because AMELY exists in the non-recombining region of chromosome Y, effectively isolating it from normal selection pressures. Other sources of amelogenin variation arise from the various isoforms of AMELX obtained from alternative splicing of mRNA transcripts. Specific roles for isoforms have yet to be established. Among other organisms, amelogenin is well conserved among eutherians, and has homologs in monotremes, reptiles and amphibians.  Application in sex determination  Differences between the X chromosome and Y chromosome versions of the amelogenin gene (AMELX and AMELY respectively) enable it to be used in sex determination of unknown human samples. AMELX’s intron 1 contains a 6-base-pair deletion relative to intron 1 of AMELY. This can be detected at low cost using polymerase chain reaction (PCR) of intron 1, followed by gel electrophoresis. Two bands of DNA, at 555 bps and 371 bps, are resolved if both the AMELX and AMELY versions of the gene are present (i.e. the sample is from a male) or one band of DNA, at 555 bps, if the AMELX version only is present (i.e. the sample is from a female). However because of AMELY variation among individuals and populations, this method of sex determination is not 100% accurate. Mutation in regions of AMELY intron 1 commonly used as primer annealing sites may disable PCR amplification. A 6bp insertion to AMELY intron 1 results in an amplicon identical in length to that of AMELX. In some males AMELY may be deleted entirely. In any of these cases only one band is visualized during gel electrophoresis of PCR products, causing misidentification of the sample as female. The misidentification rate may vary among populations, but in general appears to be low. In one study in Spain, the amelogenin sex determination test using AMELX (977bps) and AMELY (790bps) bands was performed for 1224 individuals of known gender with a 99.84% (1222/1224) accuracy rate. Another study in India, however, found 5 of its 270 men studied (1.85%) possessed an AMELY deletion, terming them “deleted-amelogenin males” (DAMs). In response the authors suggested that while the amelogenin sex test may be accurate in general, other Y chromosome markers such as SRY, STR, or 50f2 can be used for less ambiguous gender identification.  Clinical significance  Mutations in AMELX can cause amelogenesis imperfecta, a disorder of tooth enamel development.

Whereas in the simple moving average the past observations are weighted equally, exponential functions are used to assign exponentially decreasing weights over time. It is an easily learned and easily applied procedure for making some determination based on prior assumptions by the user, such as seasonality. Exponential smoothing is often used for analysis of time-series data. Exponential smoothing is one of many window functions commonly applied to smooth data in signal processing, acting as low-pass filters to remove high-frequency noise. This method is preceded by Poisson's use of recursive exponential window functions in convolutions from the 19th century, as well as Kolmogorov and Zurbenko's use of recursive moving averages from their studies of turbulence in the 1940s. The raw data sequence is often represented by {x_t} beginning at time t = 0, and the output of the exponential smoothing algorithm is commonly written as {s_t}, which may be regarded as a best estimate of what the next value of x will be. When the sequence of observations begins at time t = 0, the simplest form of exponential smoothing is given by the formulas: : \\\\begin{align} s_0& = x_0\\\\ s_{t}& = \\\\alpha x_{t} + (1-\\\\alpha)s_{t-1},\\\\ t>0 \\\\end{align} where \\\\alpha is the smoothing factor, and 0 < \\\\alpha < 1. Basic (simple) exponential smoothing (Holt Linear) The use of the exponential window function is first attributed to Poisson as an extension of a numerical analysis technique from the 17th century, and later adopted by the signal processing community in the 1940s. Here, exponential smoothing is the application of the exponential, or Poisson, window function. Exponential smoothing was first suggested in the statistical literature without citation to previous work by Robert Goodell Brown in 1956, and then expanded by Charles C. Holt in 1957. reprinted in The formulation below, which is the one commonly used, is attributed to Brown and is known as “Brown’s simple exponential smoothing”. All the methods of Holt, Winters and Brown may be seen as a simple application of recursive filtering, first found in the 1940s to convert FIR filters to IIR filters. The simplest form of exponential smoothing is given by the formula: :s_t = \\\\alpha x_{t} + (1-\\\\alpha) s_{t-1} = s_{t-1} + \\\\alpha (x_{t} - s_{t-1}). where \\\\alpha is the smoothing factor, and 0 \\\\le \\\\alpha \\\\le 1. In other words, the smoothed statistic s_t is a simple weighted average of the current observation x_t and the previous smoothed statistic s_{t-1}. Simple exponential smoothing is easily applied, and it produces a smoothed statistic as soon as two observations are available. The term smoothing factor applied to \\\\alpha here is something of a misnomer, as larger values of \\\\alpha actually reduce the level of smoothing, and in the limiting case with \\\\alpha = 1 the output series is just the current observation. Values of \\\\alpha close to one have less of a smoothing effect and give greater weight to recent changes in the data, while values of \\\\alpha closer to zero have a greater smoothing effect and are less responsive to recent changes. There is no formally correct procedure for choosing \\\\alpha. Sometimes the statistician's judgment is used to choose an appropriate factor. Alternatively, a statistical technique may be used to optimize the value of \\\\alpha. For example, the method of least squares might be used to determine the value of \\\\alpha for which the sum of the quantities (s_t - x_{t+1})^2 is minimized. Unlike some other smoothing methods, such as the simple moving average, this technique does not require any minimum number of observations to be made before it begins to produce results. In practice, however, a “good average” will not be achieved until several samples have been averaged together; for example, a constant signal will take approximately 3 / \\\\alpha stages to reach 95% of the actual value. To accurately reconstruct the original signal without information loss all stages of the exponential moving average must also be available, because older samples decay in weight exponentially. This is in contrast to a simple moving average, in which some samples can be skipped without as much loss of information due to the constant weighting of samples within the average. If a known number of samples will be missed, one can adjust a weighted average for this as well, by giving equal weight to the new sample and all those to be skipped. This simple form of exponential smoothing is also known as an exponentially weighted moving average (EWMA). Technically it can also be classified as an autoregressive integrated moving average (ARIMA) (0,1,1) model with no constant term. Time constant The time constant of an exponential moving average is the amount of time for the smoothed response of a unit step function to reach 1-1/e \\\\approx 63.2\\\\,\\\\% of the original signal. The relationship between this time constant, \\\\tau , and the smoothing factor, \\\\alpha , is given by the formula: :\\\\alpha = 1 - e^{-\\\\Delta T \\\\over \\\\tau} Where \\\\Delta T is the sampling time interval of the discrete time implementation. If the sampling time is fast compared to the time constant (\\\\Delta T \\\\ll \\\\tau) then :\\\\alpha \\\\approx { \\\\Delta T \\\\over \\\\tau } Choosing the initial smoothed value Note that in the definition above, s_0 is being initialized to x_0. Because exponential smoothing requires that at each stage we have the previous forecast, it is not obvious how to get the method started. We could assume that the initial forecast is equal to the initial value of demand; however, this approach has a serious drawback. Exponential smoothing puts substantial weight on past observations, so the initial value of demand will have an unreasonably large effect on early forecasts. This problem can be overcome by allowing the process to evolve for a reasonable number of periods (10 or more) and using the average of the demand during those periods as the initial forecast. There are many other ways of setting this initial value, but it is important to note that the smaller the value of \\\\alpha, the more sensitive your forecast will be on the selection of this initial smoother value s_0.\\"Production and Operations Analysis\\" Nahmias. 2009.Čisar, P., & Čisar, S. M. (2011). Optimization methods of EWMA statistics. Acta Polytechnica Hungarica, 8(5), 73-87. Page 78. Optimization For every exponential smoothing method we also need to choose the value for the smoothing parameters. For simple exponential smoothing, there is only one smoothing parameter (α), but for the methods that follow there is usually more than one smoothing parameter. There are cases where the smoothing parameters may be chosen in a subjective manner — the forecaster specifies the value of the smoothing parameters based on previous experience. However, a more robust and objective way to obtain values for the unknown parameters included in any exponential smoothing method is to estimate them from the observed data. The unknown parameters and the initial values for any exponential smoothing method can be estimated by minimizing the sum of squared errors (SSE). The errors are specified as e_t=y_t-\\\\hat{y}_{tt-1} for t=1,...,T (the one-step-ahead within-sample forecast errors). Hence we find the values of the unknown parameters and the initial values that minimize SSE=\\\\sum_{t=1}^T (y_t-\\\\hat{y}_{tt-1})^2=\\\\sum_{t=1}^T e_t^2 Unlike the regression case (where we have formulae to directly compute the regression coefficients which minimize the SSE) this involves a non-linear minimization problem and we need to use an optimization tool to perform this. “Exponential” naming The name 'exponential smoothing' is attributed to the use of the exponential window function during convolution. It is no longer attributed to Holt, Winters & Brown. By direct substitution of the defining equation for simple exponential smoothing back into itself we find that : \\\\begin{align} s_t& = \\\\alpha x_t + (1-\\\\alpha)s_{t-1}[3pt] & = \\\\alpha x_t + \\\\alpha (1-\\\\alpha)x_{t-1} + (1 - \\\\alpha)^2 s_{t-2}[3pt] & = \\\\alpha \\\\left[x_t + (1-\\\\alpha)x_{t-1} + (1-\\\\alpha)^2 x_{t-2} + (1-\\\\alpha)^3 x_{t-3} + \\\\cdots + (1-\\\\alpha)^{t-1} x_1 \\\\right] \\\\+ (1-\\\\alpha)^t x_0. \\\\end{align} In other words, as time passes the smoothed statistic s_t becomes the weighted average of a greater and greater number of the past observations s_{t-1},..., s_{t-}, and the weights assigned to previous observations are proportional to the terms of the geometric progression 1, (1-\\\\alpha), (1-\\\\alpha)^2,..., (1-\\\\alpha)^n,... . A geometric progression is the discrete version of an exponential function, so this is where the name for this smoothing method originated according to Statistics lore. Comparison with moving average Exponential smoothing and moving average have similar defects of introducing a lag relative to the input data. While this can be corrected by shifting the result by half the window length for a symmetrical kernel, such as a moving average or gaussian, it is unclear how appropriate this would be for exponential smoothing. They also both have roughly the same distribution of forecast error when α = 2/(k+1). They differ in that exponential smoothing takes into account all past data, whereas moving average only takes into account k past data points. Computationally speaking, they also differ in that moving average requires that the past k data points, or the data point at lag k+1 plus the most recent forecast value, to be kept, whereas exponential smoothing only needs the most recent forecast value to be kept. In the signal processing literature, the use of non-causal (symmetric) filters is commonplace, and the exponential window function is broadly used in this fashion, but a different terminology is used: exponential smoothing is equivalent to a first-order Infinite Impulse Response or IIR filter and moving average is equivalent to a Finite Impulse Response filter with equal weighting factors. Double exponential smoothing Simple exponential smoothing does not do well when there is a trend in the data, which is inconvenient. In such situations, several methods were devised under the name \\"double exponential smoothing\\" or \\"second-order exponential smoothing,\\" which is the recursive application of an exponential filter twice, thus being termed \\"double exponential smoothing\\". This nomenclature is similar to quadruple exponential smoothing, which also references its recursion depth. The basic idea behind double exponential smoothing is to introduce a term to take into account the possibility of a series exhibiting some form of trend. This slope component is itself updated via exponential smoothing. One method, sometimes referred to as \\"Holt-Winters double exponential smoothing\\" works as follows: Again, the raw data sequence of observations is represented by x_t, beginning at time t=0. We use s_t to represent the smoothed value for time t, and b_t is our best estimate of the trend at time t. The output of the algorithm is now written as F_{t+m}, an estimate of the value of x_{t+m} at time m > 0 based on the raw data up to time t. Double exponential smoothing is given by the formulas : \\\\begin{align} s_0& = x_0\\\\ b_0& = x_1 - x_0\\\\ \\\\end{align} And for t > 0 by : \\\\begin{align} s_{t}& = \\\\alpha x_{t} + (1-\\\\alpha)(s_{t-1} + b_{t-1})\\\\ b_{t}& = \\\\beta (s_t - s_{t-1}) + (1-\\\\beta)b_{t-1}\\\\ \\\\end{align} where \\\\alpha (0 \\\\le \\\\alpha \\\\le 1) is the data smoothing factor, and \\\\beta (0 \\\\le \\\\beta \\\\le 1) is the trend smoothing factor. To forecast beyond x_t is given by the approximation: \\\\begin{align} F_{t+m}& = s_t + m \\\\cdot b_t \\\\end{align} Setting the initial value b is a matter of preference. An option other than the one listed above is \\\\frac{x_n-x0}n for some n. Note that F0 is undefined (there is no estimation for time 0), and according to the definition F1=s0+b0, which is well defined, thus further values can be evaluated. A second method, referred to as either Brown's linear exponential smoothing (LES) or Brown's double exponential smoothing works as follows. : \\\\begin{align} s'_0& = x_0\\\\ s_0& = x_0\\\\ s'_{t}& = \\\\alpha x_{t} + (1-\\\\alpha)s'_{t-1}\\\\ s_{t}& = \\\\alpha s'_{t} + (1-\\\\alpha)s_{t-1}\\\\ F_{t+m}& = a_t + mb_t, \\\\end{align} where at, the estimated level at time t and bt, the estimated trend at time t are: : \\\\begin{align} a_t& = 2s'_t - s_t\\\\ b_t& = \\\\frac \\\\alpha {1-\\\\alpha} (s'_t - s_t). \\\\end{align} Triple exponential smoothing (Holt Winters) Triple exponential smoothing applies exponential smoothing three times, which is commonly used when there are three high frequency signals to be removed from a time series under study. There are different types of seasonality: 'multiplicative' and 'additive' in nature, much like addition and multiplication are basic operations in mathematics. If every month of December we sell 10,000 more apartments than we do in November the seasonality is additive in nature. However, if we sell 10% more apartments in the summer months than we do in the winter months the seasonality is multiplicative in nature. Multiplicative seasonality can be represented as a constant factor, not an absolute amount. Triple exponential smoothing was first suggested by Holt's student, Peter Winters, in 1960 after reading a signal processing book from the 1940s on exponential smoothing. Holt's novel idea was to repeat filtering an odd number of times greater than 1 and less than 5, which was popular with scholars of previous eras. While recursive filtering had been used previously, it was applied twice and four times to coincide with the Hadamard conjecture, while triple application required more than double the operations of singular convolution. The use of a triple application is considered a rule of thumb technique, rather than one based on theoretical foundations and has often been over-emphasized by practitioners. \\\\- Suppose we have a sequence of observations x_t, beginning at time t=0 with a cycle of seasonal change of length L. The method calculates a trend line for the data as well as seasonal indices that weight the values in the trend line based on where that time point falls in the cycle of length L. Let s_t represent the smoothed value of the constant part for time t, b_t is the sequence of best estimates of the linear trend that are superimposed on the seasonal changes, and c_t is the sequence of seasonal correction factors. We wish to estimate c_t at every time tmod L in the cycle that the observations take on. As a rule of thumb, a minimum of two full seasons (or 2L periods) of historical data is needed to initialize a set of seasonal factors. The output of the algorithm is again written as F_{t+m}, an estimate of the value of x_{t+m} at time t+m>0 based on the raw data up to time t. Triple exponential smoothing with multiplicative seasonality is given by the formulas : \\\\begin{align} s_0& = x_0\\\\ s_{t}& = \\\\alpha \\\\frac{x_{t}}{c_{t-L}} + (1-\\\\alpha)(s_{t-1} + b_{t-1})\\\\ b_{t}& = \\\\beta (s_t - s_{t-1}) + (1-\\\\beta)b_{t-1}\\\\ c_{t}& = \\\\gamma \\\\frac{x_{t}}{s_{t}}+(1-\\\\gamma)c_{t-L}\\\\ F_{t+m}& = (s_t + mb_t)c_{t-L+1+(m-1)\\\\mod L}, \\\\end{align} where \\\\alpha (0 \\\\le \\\\alpha \\\\le 1) is the data smoothing factor, \\\\beta (0 \\\\le \\\\beta \\\\le 1) is the trend smoothing factor, and \\\\gamma (0 \\\\le \\\\gamma \\\\le 1) is the seasonal change smoothing factor. The general formula for the initial trend estimate b is: : \\\\begin{align} b_0& = \\\\frac{1}{L} \\\\left(\\\\frac{x_{L+1}-x_1}{L} + \\\\frac{x_{L+2}-x_2}{L} + \\\\ldots + \\\\frac{x_{L+L}-x_L}{L}\\\\right) \\\\end{align} Setting the initial estimates for the seasonal indices c_i for i = 1,2,...,L is a bit more involved. If N is the number of complete cycles present in your data, then: : \\\\begin{align} \\\\ c_i& = \\\\frac{1}{N} \\\\sum_{j=1}^{N} \\\\frac{x_{L(j-1)+i}}{A_j} \\\\quad \\\\forall i& = 1,2,\\\\ldots,L \\\\ \\\\end{align} where : \\\\begin{align} A_j& = \\\\frac{\\\\sum_{i=1}^{L} x_{L(j-1)+i}}{L} \\\\quad \\\\forall j& = 1,2,\\\\ldots,N \\\\end{align} Note that A_j is the average value of x in the jth cycle of your data. Triple exponential smoothing with additive seasonality is given by: \\\\begin{align} s_0& = x_0\\\\ s_{t}& = \\\\alpha (x_{t}-c_{t-L}) + (1-\\\\alpha)(s_{t-1} + b_{t-1})\\\\ b_{t}& = \\\\beta (s_t - s_{t-1}) + (1-\\\\beta)b_{t-1}\\\\ c_{t}& = \\\\gamma (x_{t}-s_{t-1}-b_{t-1})+(1-\\\\gamma)c_{t-L}\\\\ F_{t+m}& = s_t + mb_t+c_{t-L+1+(m-1)\\\\mod L}, \\\\end{align}  Implementations in statistics packages  * R: the HoltWinters function in the stats package and ets function in the forecast package (a more complete implementation, generally resulting in a better performance). * Python: the holtwinters module of the statsmodels package allow for simple, double and triple exponential smoothing. * IBM SPSS includes Simple, Simple Seasonal, Holt's Linear Trend, Brown's Linear Trend, Damped Trend, Winters' Additive, and Winters' Multiplicative in the Time-Series modeling procedure within its Statistics and Modeler statistical packages.

A demotion may also lead to the loss of other privileges associated with a more senior rank and/or a reduction in salary or benefits. An employee may be demoted for violating the rules of the organization by a behavior such as excessive lateness, misconduct, or negligence. In some cases, an employee may be demoted as an alternative to being laid off, if the employee has poor job performance or if the company is facing a financial crisis. A move to a position at the same rank or level elsewhere in the organization is called a lateral move or deployment. A voluntary move to a lower level is also a deployment as it is not a compulsory reduction in level. Demotion is often misinterpreted simply as the opposite of a promotion, however it is only one means of undergoing a reduction in work level. Types Within the continuum of disciplinary options available within most organizations, a demotion falls in the middle range of severity. Minor violations of rules, or the first violation of a rule will typically result in a verbal or written warning or a suspension without pay. At the other extreme, for severe violations of the rules, such as embezzlement or sabotage, an employee will typically be fired and/or the company will file criminal or civil charges.

This article specifically provides special quotas for the Malay and other indigenous peoples of Malaysia in admission to the public service, awarding of public scholarships, admission to public education institutions and the awarding of trade licences. It also authorises the government to create Malay monopolies in particular trades. The given reason for this affirmative action was carried out because the Malays and other aborigines were discriminated against in employment during over 100 years of British colonial rule. Britain colonised Malaysia from 1786 to 1957 after the Anglo- Dutch Treaty of 1824. During these years, the British refused to employ Malay Indonesians and Malaysians, preferring to employ only Chinese and Indians. Critics have called such affirmative action for the Malays racial discrimination against other Malaysian citizens, with the goal of creating ketuanan Melayu (Malay supremacy). \\"Malaysian Malaysia\\" is not a mere tautology, because it distinguishes between nationality and ethnic classification. The complaint was that Malaysia was not being \\"Malaysian\\" by discriminating against non-Malays and was rather being a \\"Malay Malaysia\\". Early use The phrase \\"Malaysian Malaysia\\" is widely associated with Lee Kuan Yew, then leader of the Singapore-based People's Action Party (PAP), the prime constituent in the Malaysian Solidarity Convention, who was foremost a critic against the racial policy. In a speech, Lee scoffed at what he viewed as the discriminatory social contract in the constitution that allowed citizenship to non-Malays while providing for special programs and policies for Malays: \\"According to history, the Perak Man was believed to survive in Malaysia 10,000 years ago and more skeletons were found in Sarawak indicating the human living there since 3,000 – 4,000 years ago. Of the 50.1% percent Malays in Malaysia today,https://www.cia.gov/library/publications/the-world- factbook/geos/my.html about one-third are comparatively new immigrants like the secretary-general of UMNO, Dato' Syed Ja'afar Albar, who came to Malaya from Indonesia just before the war at the age of more than thirty. Therefore the supporters of \\"Malaysian Malaysia\\" argue that it is wrong and illogical for a particular ethnic group to think that they are more entitled to be called Malaysians than others, and that the others can become Malaysian only through their favour.\\"Ye, Lin-Sheng (2003). The Chinese Dilemma, p. 43. East West Publishing. . The campaign for a \\"Malaysian Malaysia\\" was not viewed highly by the government of Malaysia and the parties in the ruling coalition of the Alliance (later the Barisan Nasional). Those against the concept of a Malaysian Malaysia cited the fact that Malaya was progressively colonised by the British from the mid-19th century to its height in 1926. During this period, a large number of immigrant labourers, including Chinese and Indian peoples, came to Malaysia and Singapore. They suggest that during the colonial era, the Malays were forced to accommodate other peoples. Those historic immigrants and their descendants allowed to remain after the nation achieved independence should understand their presence was a privilege, not a right. Such people said that the influx of immigrants had negatively affected the rights and resources of the Malays. The argument was made in spite of the existence of Malay-Chinese Peranakans since the late 18th century, as well as regular Chinese merchant presence in Malaya long before the arrival of the British. Some politicians in the United Malays National Organisation (UMNO) thought Malaysian Malaysia threatened the Malays' special position in Malaysia. They considered Lee to be a dangerous and seditious trouble-maker; one politician called him a traitor to the country. The more moderate Prime Minister of Malaysia, Tunku Abdul Rahman, was perturbed by the campaign. He thought it would lead to trouble, as he believed that the Malays were not ready to compete without their special privileges. Eventually, Singapore was expelled from the Federation of Malaysia in 1965. Contemporary use In 1999, controversy was reignited when Lim Kit Siang of the Democratic Action Party (DAP, the former Malaysian branch of the PAP) called for a second campaign for a \\"Malaysian Malaysia\\". Then acting UMNO Youth Chief Hishamuddin Hussein angrily responded with a warning not to \\"play with fire,\\" and accused Lim of politicising an issue that had been decided at independence with the social contract. Lim argued that the concept of a Malaysian Malaysia did not differ much from the government policy of establishing a Bangsa Malaysia (Malaysian race or Malaysian nation). Some noted that Hishamuddin's grandfather, Dato' Onn Ja'afar, the founder of UMNO, had left the party to form the Independence of Malaya Party based on the concept of eliminating special privileges for the Malays. In 2006, at the Johor UMNO convention, Johor Menteri Besar (Chief Minister) Abdul Ghani Othman linked the \\"Malaysian Malaysia\\" campaign to those advocating the Bangsa Malaysia concept, insinuating that Bangsa Malaysia was a threat to the Bumiputra/Malay privileges granted under Article 153 of the Constitution.Nambiar, Ravi & Nadzmi, Siti Nurbaiyah (7 November 2006). \\"No Bangsa Malaysia in Constitution, says Najib\\", p. 6. New Straits Times. However, others criticised Ghani, with Deputy Prime Minister Najib Tun Razak stating: \\"It (Bangsa Malaysia) does not question the special rights of the Malays, our quota or anything of that sort.\\"Tan, Marsha, Teh, Eng Hock, Vijayan, Meera & Zolkepli, Farik (7 November 2006). Bangsa Malaysia in mind . The Star. 1Malaysia concept 1Malaysia or One Malaysia (Malay: Satu Malaysia) is a Malaysian idea introduced by the sixth Malaysian Prime Minister, Najib Tun Razak on 5 April 2009. The main motto is People First; Performance Now (Rakyat Didahulukan, Pencapaian Diutamakan). 1Malaysia concept according to YAB Dato'Sri Mohd Najib Tun Abdul Razak explanation: \\"We stand, we think and act as a Malaysia race. And we take actions based on the needs of all ethnic groups in our country; (\\"Kita berdiri, kita berfikir dan bertindak sebagai bangsa Malaysia. Dan kita mengambil tindakan-tindakan berdasarkan kehendak semua kumpulan etnik dalam negara kita;). While 1Malaysia does not seek to do away with Article 153 of the Malaysian Constitution it does place a strong emphasis on protecting the rights and welfare of non-Malays. This means that 1Malaysia still doesn't provide an equal right for all citizens as per 1960s Malaysian Malaysia associated to Mr. Lee Kuan Yew which later then became the prime minister the Republic of Singapore. 1Malaysia concept is to harmonise citizens of the country regardless of race without changing its racial identity. Integration under 1Malaysia is different from assimilation concept where the identity of various races were wiped out and replaced by a common national identity. Instead 1Malaysia appreciate and respect principals of Federal Constitution and ethnic identity of various races in Malaysia, and consider it as an asset or an advantage that can be proud of. 1Malaysia stressed an acceptance attitude within multi-racial citizens society, where a race/ethnic accept the racial differences of others in order for all to live together by respecting each other as a citizen in one country.

It occurred in 1521 following extensive manipulation of local factions and exploitation of pre- existing divisions by Spanish conquistador Hernán Cortés, who was aided by the support of his indigenous allies and his interpreter and companion La Malinche. Although numerous battles were fought between the Aztec Empire and the Spanish-led coalition, which was itself composed primarily of indigenous (mostly Tlaxcaltec) personnel, it was the siege of Tenochtitlan—its outcome probably largely determined by the effects of a smallpox epidemic (which devastated the Aztec population and dealt a severe blow to the Aztec leadership while leaving an immune Spanish leadership intact)—that directly led to the downfall of the Aztec civilization and marked the end of the first phase of the Spanish conquest of the Aztec Empire. The conquest of Mexico was a critical stage in the Spanish colonization of the Americas. Ultimately, Spain conquered Mexico and thereby gained substantial access to the Pacific Ocean, which meant that the Spanish Empire could finally achieve its original oceanic goal of reaching the Asian markets. Early events=The road to Tenochtitlan In April 1519 Hernán Cortés, a ruthlessly ambitious nobleman recently landed in Cuba, and the leader of the third Spanish expedition to the coast of Mexico, landed as directed by the survivors of the previous two expeditions at San Juan de Ulúa, a good harbour on Mexico's east coast, with 508 soldiers, 100 sailors, and 14 small cannons. Diego Velázquez de Cuéllar, the Governor of Cuba, called for Cortés to lead an expedition into Mexico after favourable reports from two previous expeditions to Yucatán caught the interest of the Spanish in Cuba.Conquistadors, with Michael Wood – website for 2001 PBS documentary Under the pressure of his relatives who had a different leader in mind, Velázquez regretted his decision and revoked Cortés' mandate to lead the expedition even before Cortés left Cuba. Thus Cortés had to fight for his survival as a leader while still in Cuba; twice messengers from Velázquez arrived to depose him, and twice they were spoken to with honeyed words and dissuaded from executing their mission. After Cortés sailed, Velázquez sent an army led by Pánfilo de Narváez to take him into custody. But Cortés used the same legal tactic used by Governor Velázquez when he invaded Cuba years before: he created a local government and had himself elected as the magistrate, thus (in theory) making him responsible only to the King of Spain. Cortés followed this tactic when he and his men established the city of Villa Rica de la Vera Cruz, also known as Veracruz, seven miles from the harbour of San Juan de Ulúa. An inquiry into Cortés' action was conducted in Spain in 1529 and no action was taken against him. Cortés chanced to land at the borders of Cempoala, a recently Aztec-subdued vassal state with many grievances against them. Coming into contact with a number of polities who resented Aztec rule, Cortés claimed he has arrived on the orders of his Emperor to put things in order, abolish human sacrifices, teach the locals the true faith and \\"stop them from robbing each other\\", and was successful in enforcing excellent behaviour of his army when among potential allies. Cortés clashed with some of these polities, among them the Totonacs and Tlaxcalans. The latter gave him two good day battles and one night battle, and kept up a strong defence, holding off his army on a hilltop for two weeks. His numerically inferior force finally triumphed when the minds of Tlaxcalans opened up to consideration of his ceaseless offers of peace, notably Xicotencatl the Elder and his wish to form an alliance with the Spaniards against the Aztecs which was the proffered aim of Cortés as well. It once was widely believed that the Aztecs first thought Cortés was Quetzalcoatl, a mythical god prophesied to return to Mexico—coincidentally in the same year Cortés landed and from the same direction he came. This is now believed to be an invention of the conquerors, and perhaps natives who wished to rationalize the actions of the Aztec tlatoani, Moctezuma II. Most scholars agree that the Aztecs, especially the inner circle around Moctezuma, were well convinced that Cortés was not a god in any shape or form.\\"The Mexico Reader: History, Culture, Politics\\". Joseph, Gilbert M. and Henderson, Timothy J. Duke University Press, 2002. Messages between Cortés and Moctezuma, however, frequently allude to the legend, which was widely known across the Aztec dominions to both Aztecs and their subjects, and strongly influenced them, as Bernal Díaz del Castillo repeatedly mentions. Moctezuma sent a group of noblemen and other emissaries to meet Cortés at Quauhtechcac. These emissaries brought golden jewelry as a gift, which greatly pleased the Spaniards.\\"General History of The Things of New Spain.\\" de Sahagun, Bernardino. The Human Record: Sources of Global History, Volume II. Andrea, Alfred J. and James H. Overfield. Boston: Houghton Mifflin, 2005. 128–33. According to the Florentine Codex, Lib. 12, f.6r., Moctezuma also ordered that his messengers carry the highly symbolic penacho (headdress) of Quetzalcoatl de Tula to Cortés and place it on his person. As news about the strangers reached the capital city, Moctezuma became increasingly fearful and considered fleeing the city but resigned himself to what he considered to be the fate of his people.\\"Visión de los vencidos.\\" León-Portilla, Miguel (Ed.) [1959] (1992). The Broken Spears: The Aztec Account of the Conquest of Mexico, Ángel María Garibay K. (Nahuatl- Spanish trans.), Lysander Kemp (Spanish-English trans.), Alberto Beltran (illus.), Expanded and updated edition, Boston: Beacon Press. . Cortés continued on his march towards Tenochtitlan. Before entering the city, on November 8, 1519, Cortés and his troops prepared themselves for battle, armoring themselves and their horses, and arranging themselves in proper military rank. Four horsemen were at the lead of the procession. Behind these horsemen were five more contingents: foot soldiers with iron swords and wooden or leather shields; horsemen in cuirasses, armed with iron lances, swords, and wooden shields; crossbowmen; more horsemen; soldiers armed with arquebuses; lastly, native peoples from Tlaxcalan, Tliliuhquitepec, and Huexotzinco. The indigenous soldiers wore cotton armor and were armed with shields and crossbows; many carried provisions in baskets or bundles while others escorted the cannons on wooden carts. Cortés' army entered the city on the flower- covered causeway from Iztapalapa, associated with the god Quetzalcoatl. Cortés was amicably received by Moctezuma. The captive woman Malinalli Tenépal, also known as Doña Marina, translated from Nahuatl to Chontal Maya; the Spaniard Gerónimo de Aguilar translated from Chontal Maya to Spanish. Moctezuma was soon taken hostage on November 14, 1519, as a safety measure by the vastly outnumbered Spanish. Another reason for his sudden capture was news that Moctezuma received from one of his messengers. It was reported to Moctezuma that at least eight hundred more Spaniards in thirteen great ships had arrived on the coast. Moctezuma received this information a few days before Cortés did. Cortés had been communicating to the crown that he had the entire situation under control and was practically running the city of Tenochtitlan. With the vast new Spanish ships forces on the horizon, sent by his enemy Diego Velázquez, they could only revoke his commission and recall him, thus ending his campaign in Mexico and probably dooming the Spanish attempt for a lightning conquest, as no other Spanish leader could wield authority as effectively both among the natives and the Spaniards. Therefore, Cortés made the decision to abruptly abduct the tlatoani; only with a knife to his throat could Cortés ensure his cooperation.\\"Malintzin's Choices\\" Camilla Townsend University of New Mexico Press, 2006 According to all eyewitness accounts, Moctezuma initially refused to leave his palace but after a series of threats from and debates with the Spanish captains, and assurances from Doña Marina, he agreed to move to the Axayáctal palace with his retinue. The first captain assigned to guard him was Pedro de Alvarado. Other Aztec lords were also detained by the Spanish, when they started questioning their captive tlatoani's authority. The palace was surrounded by over 100 Spanish soldiers in order to prevent any attempt at rescue.Cervantes de Salazar, Francisco. \\"Crónica de la Nueva España. Madrid: Linkgua Ediciones, 2007. Tensions mount between Aztecs and Spaniards It is uncertain why Moctezuma cooperated so readily with the Spaniards. It is possible he feared losing his life or political power; however, one of the effective threats wielded by Cortés was the destruction of his beautiful city in the case of fighting between Spaniards and Aztecs (which ultimately came to pass). This Moctezuma at all costs wanted to avoid, vacillating and deferring the rupture until this policy claimed his life. It was clear from the beginning that he was ambivalent about who Cortés and his men really were, whether they be gods, descendants of a god, ambassadors from a greater king, or just barbaric invaders. From the perspective of the tlatoani, the Spaniards might have been assigned some decisive role by fate. It could also have been a tactical move: Moctezuma may have wanted to gather more information on the Spaniards, or to wait for the end of the agricultural season and strike at the beginning of the war season. However, he did not carry out either of these actions even though high-ranking military leaders such as his brother Cuitlahuac and nephew Cacamatzin urged him to do so.Hassig, Ross. Mexico and the Spanish Conquest. New York: Longman, 1994. With Moctezuma captive, Cortés did not need to worry about being cut off from supplies or being attacked, although some of his captains had such concerns. He also assumed that he could control the Aztecs through Moctezuma. However, Cortés had little knowledge of the ruling system of the Aztecs; Moctezuma was not all-powerful as Cortés imagined. Being appointed to and maintaining the position of tlatoani was based on the ability to rule decisively; he could be replaced by another noble if he failed to do so. At any sign of weakness, Aztec nobles within Tenochtitlan and in other Aztec tributaries were liable to rebel. As Moctezuma complied with orders issued by Cortés, such as commanding tribute to be gathered and given to the Spaniards, his authority was slipping, and quickly his people began to turn against him. Cortés and his army were permitted to stay in the Palace of Axayacatl, and tensions continued to grow. While the Spaniards were in Tenochtitlan, Velázquez assembled a force of nineteen ships, more than 1400 soldiers with twenty cannons, eighty horsemen, one-hundred and twenty crossbowmen, and eighty arquebusiers under the command of Pánfilo de Narváez to capture Cortés and return him to Cuba. Velázquez felt that Cortés had exceeded his authority, and had been aware of Cortés's misconduct for nearly a year. He had to wait for favorable winds, though, and was unable to send any forces until spring. Narváez's troops landed at San Juan de Ulúa on the Gulf of Mexico coast around April 20, 1520.Hassig (2006, p. 107). After Cortés became aware of their arrival, he left Pedro de Alvarado in charge in Tenochtitlan with 80 soldiers, and brought all his forces (about two hundred and forty men) by quick marches to Narváez's camp in Cempohuallan on May 27. Several negotiations between the two Spaniards took place on the way, in which Cortés was able to persuade many persons of weight in Narváez's camp to incline to his side. Cortés attacked Narváez's camp late at night; his men, much superior in experience and organization, wounded Narváez in the eye and took him as a hostage quickly; also taken were his principal adherents, de Salvatierra and Diego Velasquez (the nephew of the Governor of Cuba). Evidence suggests that the two were in the midst of negotiations at the time, and Narváez was not expecting an attack. Cortés then completed winning over Narváez's captains with promises of the vast wealth in Tenochtitlan, inducing them to follow him back to the Aztec capital. Narváez was imprisoned in Vera Cruz, and his army was integrated into Cortés's forces. Rapid deterioration of relations=Massacre at the festival of Tóxcatl Conquistador Pedro de Alvarado. During Cortés's absence, Pedro de Alvarado was left in command in Tenochtitlan with 80 soldiers. At this time, the Aztecs began to prepare for the annual festival of Toxcatl in early May, in honor of Tezcatlipoca, otherwise known as the Smoking Mirror or the Omnipotent Power. They honored this god during the onset of the dry season so that the god would fill dry streambeds and cause rain to fall on crops. Moctezuma secured the consent of Cortés to hold the festival, and again confirmed permission with Alvarado.Levy, Buddy, Conquistador: Hernan Cortes, King Montezuma, and the Last Stands of the Aztecs, (New York: Bantam Books, 2008), 163–64. Alvarado agreed to allow the festival on the condition that there would be no human sacrifice, but the Toxcatl festival had featured human sacrifice as the main part of its climactic rituals. The sacrifice involved the killing of a young man who had been impersonating the Toxcatl deity for a full year. Thus, prohibiting human sacrifice during this festival was an untenable proposition for the Aztecs. Before the festival, Alvarado encountered a group of women building a statue of Huitzilopochtli and the image unsettled him, and he became suspicious about the eventuality of human sacrifice. He tortured priests and nobles and discovered that the Aztecs were planning a revolt. Unable to assert control over events, he sequestered Moctezuma and increased the guards around the tlatoani.Levy, Buddy, Conquistador: Hernan Cortes, King Montezuma, and the Last Stands of the Aztecs, (New York: Bantam Books, 2008), 166. By the day of the festival, the Aztecs had gathered on the Patio of Dances. Alvarado had sixty of his men as well as many of his Tlaxcalan allies into positions around the patio. The Aztecs initiated the Serpent Dance. The euphoric dancing as well as the accompanying flute and drum playing disturbed Alvarado about the potential for revolt. He ordered the gates closed and initiated the killing of many thousands of Aztec nobles, warriors and priests.Levy, Buddy, Conquistador: Hernan Cortes, King Montezuma, and the Last Stands of the Aztecs, (New York: Bantam Books, 2008), 168–70. Alvarado, the conquistadors and the Tlaxcalans retreated to their base in the Palace of Axayacatl and secured the entrances. Alvarado ordered his men to shoot their cannons, crossbows and arquebuses into the gathering crowd. The result either preempted or triggered the Aztec revolt, which was, however, inevitable from the moment of Moctezuma's capture and was accelerated by the split of the Spanish forces. Alvarado forced Moctezuma to appeal to the crowd outside the Palace and this appeal temporarily calmed them.Levy, Buddy, Conquistador: Hernan Cortes, King Montezuma, and the Last Stands of the Aztecs, (New York: Bantam Books, 2008), 170–71. The massacre had the result of resolutely turning all the Aztecs against the Spanish and completely undermining Moctezuma's authority.Levy, Buddy, Conquistador: Hernan Cortes, King Montezuma, and the Last Stands of the Aztecs, (New York: Bantam Books, 2008), 171. Aztec revolt Alvarado sent word to Cortés of the events, and Cortés hurried back to Tenochtitlan on June 24 with 1,300 soldiers, 96 horses, 80 crossbowmen, and 80 arquebusiers. Cortés also came with 2,000 Tlaxcalan warriors on the journey. Cortés entered the palace unscathed, as the hostilities had not started yet, although the Aztecs had probably planned to ambush him. The Aztecs had already stopped sending food and supplies to the Spaniards. They became suspicious and watched for people trying to sneak supplies to them; many innocent people were slaughtered because they were suspected of helping them.* A few days after the great forces of Cortés got into Tenochtitlan, the roads were shut and the causeway bridges were raised. The Aztecs halted any Spanish attacks or attempts to leave the palace. Every Spanish soldier that was not killed was wounded. Cortés failed to grasp the full extent of the situation, as the attack on the festival was the last straw for the Aztecs, who now were completely against Moctezuma and the Spanish. The military gains of the attack therefore had a serious political cost for Cortés. His new followers were greatly disturbed at the power of the Aztecs, and held Cortés to be a liar since nobody revered them and brought them food and gifts as Cortés had promised. Cortés attempted to parlay with the Aztecs, and after this failed he sent Moctezuma to tell his people to stop fighting. However, the Aztecs refused. The Spanish asserted that Moctezuma was stoned to death by his own people as he attempted to speak with them. Three stones hit him, one of them on the head, so cerebral hematoma is possible. Moctezuma refused all medical help as well as food, and died soon after the attack.Smith 1996, 2003, p. 275. The Aztecs later claimed that Moctezuma had been murdered by the Spanish. Two other local rulers were found strangled as well.Gruzinski, Serge. The Aztecs: Rise and Fall of an Empire, \\"Abrams Discoveries\\" series. New York: Harry N. Abrams, 1992. Moctezuma's younger brother Cuitláhuac, who had been ruler of Ixtlapalapan until then, was chosen as the Tlatoani. La Noche Triste and the Spanish flight to Tlaxcala La Noche Triste – The Sad Night The flight of the Spanish from Tenochtitlan was a crushing defeat for Cortés that was just short of annihilation. It is still remembered as \\"La Noche Triste,\\" The Night of Sorrows. Popular tales say Cortés wept under a tree the night of the massacre of his troops at the hands of the Aztecs. Initially, Cortés resolved to fight the Aztec troops opposed to him and win the city in direct conflict. This stemmed from three errors of judgment: 1\\\\. Underestimation of the Aztecs. Cortés fought the Tabascans, the Cempoalans, the Tlaxcalans and found them strong opponents, but always prevailed. He had never fought an Aztec army before and did not expect such resolve and martial skill as he encountered – although all his previous foes warned that the Mexicans were the greatest warriors they had ever seen and could not be withstood within their city. 2\\\\. Overrating his forces. Since Cortés won all his battles in Mexico before this while at the head of much inferior forces, being in charge of a nearly full Spanish tercio must have made him feel invincible. In fact, the only serviceable portion of his army were his old followers with great experience of Mexican warfare, who were by this time severely whittled down by wounds and disease. The newly-arrived Narvaéz's men did not have experience in local fighting and were worth much less in combat - and eventually perished in much greater numbers than the veterans. 3\\\\. Unprepared for enemy tactics. The Aztecs had fought for the lake cities many times before and their tactics were excellent - the use of canoes, the use of flat roofs with prepared missiles, dropping down into the lake when cornered, and destroying bridges. Cavalry could not operate in these conditions and control of the water was crucial, which Cortés did not realize at first. With this mindset, Cortés launched an attack directly at the chief temple of the city, the Cue of Huichilopotzli. In spite of determined opposition, the Spanish push got them to the top of the temple's 114 steps, but at a great loss. Cortés aimed at routing the Aztecs and by holding both Moctezuma and the great temple - being able to offer peace once again. However, the Spanish attack encountered such fierce resistance and numerous fatalities among his men, that the plan fell apart. The retreat to Spanish quarters was as hard as the attack, and part of their quarters were plundered in the meantime. The direct loss of nearly a hundred men dead and the fierce spirit of the Aztecs who refused to be cowed by his ascent of the temple convinced Cortés that a night escape was now his only option for survival. Though a flight from the city would make Cortés appear weak before his indigenous allies, it was this or death for the Spanish forces. Cortés and his men were in the center of the city, and would most likely have to fight their way out no matter what direction they took. Cortés wanted to flee to Tlaxcala, so a path directly east would have been most favorable. Nevertheless, this would require hundreds of canoes to move all of Cortés's people and supplies, which he was unable to procure in his position. Cortés therefore had to choose among three land routes: north to Tlatelolco, which was the least dangerous path but required the longest trip through the city; south to Coyohuacan and Iztapalapa, two towns that would not welcome the Spanish; or west to Tlacopan, which required the shortest trip through Tenochtitlan, though they would not be welcome there either. Cortés decided on the west causeway to Tlacopan, needing the quickest route out of Tenochtitlan with all his provisions and people. Heavy rains and a moonless night provided some cover for the escaping Spanish. On that \\"Sad Night,\\" July 1, 1520, the Spanish forces exited the palace first with their indigenous allies close behind, bringing as much treasure as possible. Cortés had hoped to go undetected by muffling the horses' hooves and carrying wooden boards to cross the canals. The Spanish forces were able to pass through the first three canals, the Tecpantzinco, Tzapotlan, and Atenchicalco. However, they were discovered on the fourth canal at Mixcoatechialtitlan. One account says a woman fetching water saw them and alerted the city, another says it was a sentry. Some Aztecs set out in canoes, others by road to Nonchualco then Tlacopan to cut the Spanish off. The Aztecs attacked the fleeing Spanish on the Tlacopan causeway from canoes, shooting arrows at them. The Spanish fired their crossbows and arquebuses, but were unable to see their attackers or get into formation. Many Spaniards leaped into the water and drowned, weighed down by armor and booty. When faced with a gap in the causeway, Alvarado made the famous \\"leap of Alvarado\\" using a spear to get to the other side. Approximately a third of the Spaniards succeeded in reaching the mainland, while the remaining ones died in battle or were captured and later sacrificed on Aztec altars - these were reported to be mostly the followers of Narváez, less experienced and more weighted down with gold, which was handed out freely before the escape. After crossing over the bridge, the surviving Spanish had little reprieve before the Aztecs appeared to attack and chase them towards Tlacopan. When they arrived at Tlacopan, a good number of Spaniards had been killed, as well as most of the indigenous warriors, and some of the horses; all of the cannons and most of the crossbows and other weapons were lost. In all battles with main Aztec forces after that, Spaniards noted their lost arms being used against them. The Spanish finally found refuge in Otancalpolco, where they were aided by the Teocalhueyacans. The morning after, the Aztecs returned to recover the spoils from the canals. To reach Tlaxcala, Cortés had to bring his troops around Lake Texcoco. Though the Spanish were under attack the entire trip, because Cortés took his troops through the northern towns, they were at an advantage. The northern valley was less populous, travel was difficult, and it was still the agricultural season, so the attacks on Cortés's forces were not very heavy. As Cortés arrived in more densely inhabited areas east of the lake, the attacks were more forceful.  Battle of Otumba  Battle of Otumba Before reaching Tlaxcala, the scanty Spanish forces arrived at the plain of Otumba Valley (Otompan), where they were met by a vast Aztec army intent on their destruction. The Aztecs intended to cut short the Spanish retreat from Tenochtitlan and annihilate them. Here, the Aztecs made their own errors of judgement by underestimating the shock value of the Spanish caballeros because all they had seen was the horses traveling gingerly on the wet paved streets of Tenochtitlan. They had never seen them used in open battle on the plains. By marshalling on an open plain, they also allowed experienced Spanish commanders to bring to bear their own tactics, weaponry, and the know-how of European warfare. Despite the overwhelming numbers of Aztecs and the generally poor condition of the Spanish survivors, Cortés snatched victory from the jaws of defeat. He spotted the Aztec commander in his ornate and colourful feather tlahuiztli and immediately charged him with several horsemen, killing the Aztec commander and most other leaders as they were clearly marked by their golden plumage and an easy target for a charge. The many Tlaxcalan allies of the Spanish are mentioned as playing an important role in the battle, armed with Spanish swords and shields. The Spanish suffered some losses, but were victorious over the Aztecs, who then retreated and were pursued by cavalry. When Cortés finally reached Tlaxcala five days after fleeing Tenochtitlan, he had lost over 860 Spanish soldiers, over a thousand Tlaxcalans, as well as Spanish women who had accompanied Narváez's troops. Cortés claimed only 15 Spaniards were lost along with 2,000 native allies. Cano, another primary source, gives 1,150 Spaniards dead, though this figure was likely too high and might encompass the total loss from entering Mexico to arriving into Tlaxcala. Cortés' chaplain back in Spain, Francisco López de Gómara, estimated that 450 Spaniards and 4,000 allies had died. Other sources estimate that nearly half of the Spanish and almost all of the natives were killed or wounded. The women survivors included Cortés's translator and lover La Malinche, María Estrada, and two of Moctezuma's daughters who had been given to Cortés, including the emperor's favorite and reportedly most beautiful daughter Tecuichpotzin (later Doña Isabel Moctezuma). A third daughter died, leaving behind her infant by Cortés, the mysterious second \\"María\\" named in his will. Both sides attempt to recover=Shifting alliances Cuitláhuac had been elected as the emperor immediately following Moctezuma's death. It was necessary for him to prove his power and authority to keep the tributaries from revolting. Usually, the new king would take his army on a campaign before coronation; this demonstration would solidify necessary ties. However, Cuitláhuac was not in a position to do this, as it was not yet war season; therefore, allegiance to the Spanish seemed to be an option for many tributaries. The Aztec Empire was very susceptible to division: most of the tributary states were divided internally, and their loyalty to the Aztecs was based either on their own interests or fear of punishment. It was necessary for Cortés to rebuild his alliances after his escape from Tenochtitlan before he could try again to take the city. He started with the Tlaxcalans. Tlaxcala was an autonomous state, and a fierce enemy of the Aztecs. Another strong motivation to join forces with the Spanish was that Tlaxcala was encircled by Aztec tributaries. The Tlaxcalans could have crushed the Spaniards at this point or turned them over to the Aztecs. In fact, the Aztecs sent emissaries promising peace and prosperity if they would do just that. The Tlaxcalan leaders rebuffed the overtures of the Aztec emissaries, deciding to continue their friendship with Cortés. Cortés managed to negotiate an alliance; however, the Tlaxcalans required heavy concessions from Cortés for their continued support, which he was to provide after they defeated the Aztecs. They expected the Spanish to pay for their supplies, to have the city of Cholula, an equal share of any of the spoils, the right to build a citadel in Tenochtitlan, and finally, to be exempted from any future tribute. Cortés was willing to promise anything in the name of the King of Spain, and agreed to their demands. The Spanish did complain about having to pay for their food and water with their gold and other jewels with which they had escaped Tenochtitlan. The Spanish authorities would later disown this treaty with the Tlaxcalans after the fall of Tenochtitlan. Cortés needed to gain other new allies as well. If the Spaniards were able to prove they could protect their new allies from the possibility of Aztec retribution, changing sides would not be too difficult for other tributaries. After Cortés' forces managed to defeat the smaller armies of some Aztec tributary states, Tepeyac, and later, Yauhtepec and Cuauhnahuac were easily won over. Cortés also used political maneuvering to assure the allegiance of other states, such as Tetzcoco. In addition, Cortés replaced kings with those who he knew would be loyal to him. Cortés now controlled many major towns, which simultaneously bolstered Cortés's forces while weakening the Aztecs. Though the largest group of indigenous allies were Tlaxcalans, the Huexotzinco, Atlixco, Tliliuhqui- Tepecs, Tetzcocans, Chalca, Alcohua, and Tepanecs were all important allies as well, and had all been previously subjugated by the Aztecs. Even the former Triple Alliance member city of Tetzcoco (or Texcoco) became a Spanish ally. As the rebellion attempt led by the Tetzcocan Tlatoani, Cacamatzin, in times of Moctezuma's reclusion was conjured by the Spanish, Cortés named one of Cacamatzin's brothers as new tlatoani. He was Ixtlilxóchitl II, who had disagreed with his brother and always proved friendly to the Spanish. Later, Cortés also occupied the city as base for the construction of brigantines. However, one faction of Tetzcocan warriors remained loyal to the Aztecs. Cortés had to put down internal struggles among the Spanish troops as well. The remaining Spanish soldiers were somewhat divided; many wanted nothing more than to go home, or at the very least to return to Vera Cruz and wait for reinforcements. Cortés hurriedly quashed this faction, determined to finish what he had started. Not only had he staked everything he had or could borrow on this enterprise, he had completely compromised himself by defying his superior Velázquez. He knew that in defeat he would be considered a traitor to Spain, but that in success he would be its hero. So he argued, cajoled, bullied, and coerced his troops, and they began preparing for the siege of Mexico. In this Cortés showed skill at exploiting the divisions within and between the Aztec states while hiding those of his own troops. Smallpox reduces the local population While Cortés was rebuilding his alliances and garnering more supplies, a smallpox epidemic struck the natives of the Valley of Mexico, including Tenochtitlan. The disease was probably carried by a Spanish slave from Narváez's forces, who had been abandoned in the capital during the Spanish flight. Smallpox played a crucial role in the Spanish success during the Siege of Tenochtitlan from 1519–1521, a fact not mentioned in some historical accounts. The disease broke out in Tenochtitlan in late October 1520. The epidemic lasted sixty days, ending by early December.León, Portilla Miguel. 2006 The Broken Spears: the Aztec Account of the Conquest of Mexico. Boston: Beacon It was at this event where firsthand accounts were recorded in the Florentine Codex concerning the adverse effects of the smallpox epidemic of the Aztecs, which stated, \\"many died from this plague, and many others died of hunger. They could not get up and search for food, and everyone else was too sick to care for them, so they starved to death in their beds. By the time the danger was recognized, the plague was well established that nothing could halt it\\". The smallpox epidemic caused not only infection to the Mexica peoples, but it weakened able bodied people who could no longer grow and harvest their crops, which in turn led to mass famine and death from malnutrition. While the population of Tenochtitlan was recovering, the disease continued to Chalco, a city on the southeast corner of Lake Texcoco that was formerly controlled by the Aztecs but now occupied by the Spanish. Reproduction and population growth declined since people of child-bearing age either had to fight off the Spanish invasion or died due to famine, malnutrition or other diseases.(Leon-Portilla 1962: 117, León, Portilla Miguel. 2006 The Broken Spears: the Aztec Account of the Conquest of Mexico. Boston: Beacon Diseases like smallpox could travel great distances and spread throughout large populations, which was the case with the Aztecs having lost approximately 50% of its population from smallpox and other diseases.(Diamond 1999: 210), Diamond, Jared M. 1999 Guns, Germs, and Steel: the Fates of Human Societies. New York: Norton. The disease killed an estimated forty percent of the native population in the area within a year. The Aztecs codices give ample depictions of the disease's progression. It was known to them as the huey ahuizotl (great rash). Cuitlahuac contracted the disease and died after ruling for eighty days. Though the disease also affected the Spanish-aligned forces somewhat, it had more dire consequences for the leadership on the side of the Aztecs, as they were much harder hit by the smallpox than the Spanish leaders, who were largely resistant to the disease. Aztecs regroup It is often debated why the Aztecs took little action against the Spanish and their allies after they fled the city. One reason was that Tenochtitlan was certainly in a state of disorder: the smallpox disease ravaged the population, killing still more important leaders and nobles, and a new king, Cuauhtémoc, son of King Ahuitzotl, was placed on the throne in February 1521. The people were in the process of mourning the dead and rebuilding their damaged city. It is possible that the Aztecs truly believed that the Spanish were gone for good. In addition, Cortés astutely directed his forces in multiple directions in preparing his encirclement of the Aztec capital, and knew how to use the military initiative that he gained after the battle of Otumba. Staying within Tenochtitlan as a defensive tactic may have seemed like a reliable strategy at the time. This would allow them the largest possible army that would be close to its supplies, while affording them the mobility provided by the surrounding lake. Any Spanish assault would have to come through the causeways, where the Aztecs could easily attack them. As the only Aztec victory against the Spanish was won in the city using their peculiar urban warfare tactics, and as they counted on retaining control over the water, it seems natural that they wanted to risk their main army only to defend their capital. However, it would not be correct to infer that the Aztecs were passive observers of their fate - they did send numerous expeditions to aid their allies against Cortés at every point, with 10 to 20 thousand forces risked in every engagement, such as in Chalco and Chapultepec. They were driven back every time, and some of the native allies won their own victories over the Aztecs, as their dread of their invincible overlords faded with every success of Cortés. Siege of Tenochtitlan=Cortés plans and prepares Cortés's overall plan was to trap and besiege the Aztecs within their capital. Cortés intended to do that primarily by increasing his power and mobility on the lake, while protecting \\"his flanks while they marched up the causeway\\", previously one of his main weaknesses. He ordered the construction of thirteen sloops (brigantines) in Tlaxcala, by his master shipbuilder, Martín López. Cortés continued to receive a steady stream of supplies from ships arriving at Vera Cruz, one ship from Spain loaded with \\"arms and powder\\", and two ships intended for Narváez. Cortés also received one hundred and fifty soldiers and twenty horses from the abandoned Panuco River settlement. A large source of succour for Cortés were the misguided expeditions by Francisco de Garay, the Governor of Jamaica, who kept sending ship after ship to aid his original Panuco venture long after it had been destroyed and abandoned; all of these ships and forces ended up reinforcing Cortés before the siege.Diaz, B., 1963, The Conquest of New Spain, London: Penguin Books, Cortés then decided to move his army to Texcoco, where he could assemble and launch the sloops in the creeks flowing into Lake Texcoco. With his main headquarters in Texcoco, he could stop his forces from being spread too thin around the lake, and there he could contact them where they needed. Xicotencatl the Elder provided Cortés with over ten thousand Tlaxcalan warriors under the command of Chichimecatecle. Cortés departed Tlaxcala on the day after Christmas 1520. When his force arrived at the outskirts of Texcoco, he was met by seven chieftains stating their leader Coanacotzin begs \\"for your friendship\\". Cortés quickly replaced that leader with the son of Nezahualpilli, baptized as Don Hernán Cortés. After winning over Chalco and Tlamanalco, Cortés sent eight Mexican prisoners to Cuauhtemoc stating, \\"all the towns in the neighborhood were now on our side, as well as the Tlaxcalans\\". Cortés intended to blockade Mexico and then destroy it. Once Martin López and Chichimecatecle brought the logs and planks to Texcoco, the sloops were built quickly. Cuauhtemoc's forces were defeated four times in March 1521, around Chalco and Huaxtepec, and Cortés received another ship load of arms and men from the Emperor. On 6 April 1521, Cortés met with the caciques around Chalco, and announced he would \\"bring peace\\" and blockade Mexico. He wanted all of their warriors ready the next day when he put thirteen sloops into the lake (misleadingly called \\"launches\\" in some translations). He was then joined at Chimaluacan by twenty thousand warriors from Chalco, Texcoco, Huejotzingo, and Tlaxcala. Cortés fought a major engagement with seventeen thousand of Cuauhtemoc's warriors at Xochimilco, before continuing his march northwestward. Cortés found Coyoacan, Tacuba, Atzcapotzalco, and Cuauhitlan deserted. Returning to Texcoco, which had been guarded by his Captain Gonzalo de Sandoval, Cortés was joined by many more men from Castile. Cortés then discovered a plot aimed at his murder, for which he had the main conspirator, Antonio de Villafana, hanged. Thereafter, Cortés had a personal guard of six soldiers, under the command of Antonio de Quiñones. The Spaniards also held their third auctioning of branded slaves, Mexican allies captured by Cortés, \\"who had revolted after giving their obedience to His Majesty.\\" Cortés had 84 horsemen, 194 arbalesters and arquebusiers, plus 650 Spanish foot soldiers. He stationed 25 men on every sloop, 12 oarsmen, 12 crossbowmen and musketeers, and a captain. Each sloop had rigging, sails, oars, and spare oars. Additionally, Cortés had 20,000 warriors from Tlaxcala, Huexotzinco, and Cholula. The Tlaxcalans were led by Xicotencatl II and Chichimecatecle. Cortés was ready to start the blockade of Mexico after Corpus Christi (feast). Cortés put Alvarado in command of 30 horsemen, 18 arbalesters and arquebusiers, 150 Spanish foot soldiers, and 8,000 Tlaxcalan allies, and sent him, accompanied by his brother Jorge de Alvarado, Gutierrez de Badajoz, and Andrés de Monjaraz, to secure Tacuba. Cristóbal de Olid took 30 horsemen, 20 arbalesters and arquebusiers, 175 foot soldiers, and 8,000 Tlaxcalan allies, accompanied by Andrés de Tapia, Francisco Verdugo, and Francisco de Lugo, and secured Coyohuacan. Gonzalo de Sandoval took 24 horsemen, 14 arquebusiers and arbalesters, 150 Spanish foot soldiers, and 8,000 warriors from Chalco and Huexotzinco, accompanied by Luis Marin and Pedro de Ircio, to secure Ixtlapalapan. Cortés commanded the 13 sloops. Cortés' forces took up these positions on May 22. The first battles An encounter between Spanish and Aztec combatants as depicted in the History of Tlaxcala. The forces under Alvarado and Olid marched first towards Chapultepec to disconnect the Aztecs from their water supply. There were springs there that supplied much of the city's water by aqueduct; the rest of the city's water was brought in by canoe. The two generals then tried to bring their forces over the causeway at Tlacopan, resulting in the Battle of Tlacopan. The Aztec forces managed to push back the Spanish and halt this assault on the capital with a determined and hard-fought land and naval counterattack. Cortés faced \\"more than a thousand canoes\\" after he launched his thirteen sloops from Texcoco. Yet a \\"favorable breeze sprang up\\", enabling him to overturn many canoes and kill or capture many. After winning the First Battle on the Lake, Cortés camped with Olid's forces. The Aztec canoe fleets worked well for attacking the Spanish because they allowed the Aztecs to surround the Spanish on both sides of the causeway. Cortés decided to make an opening in the causeway so that his brigantines could help defend his forces from both sides. He then distributed the sloops amongst his attacking forces, four to Alvarado, six for Olid, and two to Sandoval on the Tepeaquilla causeway. After this move, the Aztecs could no longer attack from their canoes on the opposite side of the Spanish brigantines, and \\"the fighting went very much in our favour\\", according to Díaz. With his brigantines, Cortés could also send forces and supplies to areas he previously could not, which put a kink in Cuauhtémoc's plan. To make it more difficult for the Spanish ships to aid the Spanish soldier's advance along the causeways, the Aztecs dug deep pits in shallow areas of the lakes, into which they hoped the Spaniards would stumble, and fixed concealed stakes into the lake bottom to impale the launches. The Spanish horses were also ineffective on the causeways. Cortés was forced to adapt his plans again, as his initial land campaigns were ineffective. He had planned to attack on the causeways during the daytime and retreat to camp at night; however, the Aztecs moved in to occupy the abandoned bridges and barricades as soon as the Spanish forces left. Consequently, Cortés had his forces set up on the causeways at night to defend their positions. Cortés also sent orders to \\"never on any account to leave a gap unblocked, and that all the horsemen were to sleep on the causeway with their horses saddled and bridled all night long.\\" This allowed the Spanish to progress closer and closer towards the city. The Spaniards prevented food and water from reaching Tenochtitlan along the three causeways. They limited the supplies reaching the city from the nine surrounding towns via canoe, by sending out two of their launches on nightly capture missions. However, the Aztecs were successful in setting an ambush with thirty of their pirogues in an area in which they had placed impaling stakes. They captured two Spanish launches, killing Captain de Portilla and Pedro Barba. The Spanish advance closer During the siege of Tenochtitlan, Hernan Cortés narrowly escaped capture by Aztec warriors. Detail of a painting at the Museo de América, Madrid, Spain. After capturing two chieftains, Cortés learned of another Aztec plot to ambush his launches with forty pirogues. Cortés then organized a counter-ambush with six of his launches, which was successful, \\"killing many warriors and taking many prisoners.\\" Afterwards, the Aztec \\"did not dare to lay any more ambuscades, or to bring in food and water as openly as before.\\" Lakeside towns, including Iztapalapa, Churubusco, Culuacan, and Mixquic made peace with the Spaniards. The fighting in Tenochtitlan was described by the American historian Charles Robinson as \\"desperate\\" as both sides battled one another in the streets in a ferocious battle where no quarter was given nor asked for.Robinson, Charles The Spanish Invasion of Mexico 1519–1521, London: Osprey, 2004 p. 58. Cuauhtemoc then attacked all three Spanish camps simultaneously with his entire army on the feast day of St. John. On the Tacuba Causeway across Lake Texcoco connecting Tenochtitlan to the mainland along a street now known as Puente de Alvarado (Alvarado's Bridge) in Mexico City, Pedro de Alvarado made a mad cavalry charge across a gap in the Causeway. As Alvarado and his cavalry emerged on the other side of the gap with the infantry behind, Aztec canoes filled the gap. Pedro de Alvarado was wounded along with eight men in his camp. Alvarado escaped from the ambush, but five of his men were captured and taken off to the Great Temple to be sacrificed. Much to their horror, the Spanish from their positions could see their captured comrades being sacrificed on the Great Pyramid, which increased their hatred of the Aztecs.Robinson, Charles The Spanish Invasion of Mexico 1519–1521, London: Osprey, 2004 p. 59. At the end of each day, the Spanish gave a prayer: \\"Oh, thanks be to God that they did not carry me off today to be sacrificed.\\" Cortés then decided to push forward a simultaneous attack towards the Mexican market square. However, he neglected to fill in a channel as he advanced, and when the Aztec counter-attacked, Cortés was wounded and almost captured. Cristóbal de Olea and Cristóbal de Guzmán gave their lives for Cortés, and sixty-five Spanish soldiers were captured alive. Cuauhtemoc then had five of their heads thrown at Alvarado's camp, four thrown at Cortés' camp, six thrown at Sandoval's camp, while ten more were sacrificed to the Huitzilopochtli and Texcatlipoca idols. Díaz relates, \\"...the dismal drum of Huichilobos sounded again,...we saw our comrades who had been captured in Cortés' defeat being dragged up the steps to be sacrificed...cutting open their chests, drew out their palpitating hearts which they offered to the idols...the Indian butchers...cut off their arms and legs...then they ate their flesh with a sauce of peppers and tomatoes...throwing their trunks and entrails to the lions and tigers and serpents and snakes.\\" Cuauhtemoc then \\"sent the hands and feet of our soldiers, and the skin of their faces...to all the towns of our allies...\\" The Aztec sacrificed a batch of Spanish prisoners each night for ten nights. The Aztec cast off the cooked limbs of their prisoners to the Tlaxcalans, shouting: \\"Eat the flesh of these teules [\\"Gods\\"-a reference to the early belief that Spanish were gods] and of your brothers because we are sated with it\\". The Aztec continued to attack the Spaniards on the causeways, \\"day and night\\". The Spanish allies in the cities surrounding the lake lost many lives or \\"went home wounded\\", and \\"half their canoes were destroyed\\". Yet, \\"they did not help the Aztec any more, for they loathed them.\\" Yet, of the 24,000 allies, only 200 remained in the three Spanish camps, the rest deciding to return home. Ahuaxpitzactzin (later baptized as Don Carlos), the brother of the Texcoco lord Don Fernando, remained in Cortés' camp with forty relatives and friends. The Huejotzinco Cacique remained in Sandoval's camp with fifty men. Alvarado's camp had Chichimecatecle, the two sons of Lorenzo de Vargas, and eighty Tlaxcalans. To maintain the advance, Cortés razed every neighborhood he captured, using the rubble to fill up canals and gaps in the causeways to allow his infantry and cavalry to advance in formation, a fighting tactic that favored the Spanish instead of engaging in hand-to-hand street fighting, which favored the Aztec. Cortés then concentrated on letting the Aztec \\"eat up all the provisions they have\\" and drink brackish water. The Spaniards gradually advanced along the causeways, though without allies. Their launches had freedom of the lake, after devising a method for breaking the impaling stakes the Aztec had placed for them. After twelve days of this, the Spanish allies realized the prophecy by the Aztec idols, that the Spaniards would be dead in ten days was false. Two thousand warriors returned from Texcoco, as did many Tlaxcan warriors under Tepaneca from Topeyanco, and those from Huejotzingo and Cholula. Cuauhtemoc then enlisted his allies in Matlazingo, Malinalco, and Tulapa, in attacking the Spaniards from the rear. However, Cortés sent Andrés de Tapia, with 20 horsemen and 100 soldiers, and Gonzalo de Sandoval, with 20 horsemen and 80 soldiers, to help his allies attack this new threat. They returned with two of the Matlazingo chieftains as prisoners. As the Spanish employed more successful strategies, their stranglehold on Tenochtitlan tightened, and famine began to affect the Aztecs. The Aztecs were cut off from the mainland because of the occupied causeways. Cortés also had the advantage of fighting a mostly defensive battle. Though Cuauhtémoc organized a large-scale attack on Alvarado's forces at Tlacopan, the Aztec forces were pushed back. Throughout the siege, the Aztecs had little aid from outside of Tenochtitlan. The remaining loyal tributaries had difficulty sending forces, because it would leave them vulnerable to Spanish attack. Many of these loyal tributaries were surrounded by the Spanish. Though the tributaries often went back and forth in their loyalties at any sign of change, the Spanish tried hard not to lose any allies. They feared a \\"snowball effect\\": if one tributary left, others might follow. Therefore, they brutally crushed any tributaries who tried to send help to Tenochtitlan. Any shipments of food and water were intercepted, and even those trying to fish in the lake were attacked. The situation inside the city was desperate: because of the famine and the smallpox there were already thousands of victims, women offered to the gods even their children's clothes, so most children were stark naked. Many Aztecs drank dirty, brackish water because of their severe thirst and contracted dysentery. The famine was so severe that the Aztecs ate anything, even wood, leather, and bricks for sustenance. The Spanish continued to push closer to Tenochtitlan. The Aztecs changed tactics as often as the Spanish did, preventing Cortés's forces from being entirely victorious. However, the Aztecs were severely worn down. They had no new troops, supplies, food, nor water. The Spanish received a large amount of supplies from Vera Cruz, and, somewhat renewed, finally entered the main part of Tenochtitlan. The Aztecs' last stand Cortés then ordered a simultaneous advance of all three camps towards the Tlatelolco marketplace. Alvarado's company made it there first, and Gutierrez de Badajoz advanced to the top of the Huichilopotzli cu, setting it afire and planting their Spanish banners. Cortés' and Sandoval's men were able to join them there after four more days of fighting. The Spanish forces and their allies advanced into the city. Despite inflicting heavy casualties, the Aztecs could not halt the Spanish advance. While the fighting in the city raged, the Aztecs cut out and ate the hearts of 70 Spanish prisoners-of-war at the altar to Huitzilopochtli. By August, many of the native inhabitants had fled Tlatelolco. Cortés sent emissaries to negotiate with the Tlatelolcas to join his side, but the Tlatelolcas remained loyal to the Aztecs. Throughout the siege, the Tlaxcalans waged a merciless campaign against the Aztecs who had long oppressed them as for a hundred years the Tlaxcalans had been forced to hand over an annual quota of young men and women to be sacrificed and eaten at the Great Pyramid of Tenochtitlan, and now the Tlaxcalans saw their chance for revenge.Robinson, Charles The Spanish Invasion of Mexico 1519–1521, London: Osprey, 2004 p. 60. The American historian Charles Robinson wrote: \\"Centuries of hate and the basic viciousness of Mesoamerican warfare combined in violence that appalled Cortés himself\\". In letter to the Holy Roman Emperor Charles V, Cortés wrote: > \\"We had more trouble in preventing our allies from killing with such cruelty > than we had in fighting the enemy. For no race, however savage, has ever > practiced such fierce and unnatural cruelty as the natives of these parts. > Our allies also took many spoils that day, which we were unable to prevent, > as they numbered more than 150,000 and we Spaniards only some nine hundred. > Neither our precautions nor our warnings could stop their looting, though we > did all we could...I had posted Spaniards in every street, so that when the > people began to come out [to surrender] they might prevent our allies from > killing those wretched people, whose numbers was uncountable. I also told > the captains of our allies that on no account should any of those people be > slain; but there were so many that we could not prevent more than fifteen > thousand being killed and sacrificed [by the Tlaxcalans] that day\\". Throughout the battles with the Spanish, the Aztecs still practiced the traditional ceremonies and customs. Tlapaltecatl Opochtzin was chosen to be outfitted to wear the quetzal owl costume. He was supplied with darts sacred to Huitzilopochtli, which came with wooden tips and flint tops. When he came, the Spanish soldiers appeared scared and intimidated. They chased the owl- warrior, but he was neither captured nor killed. The Aztecs took this as a good sign, but they could fight no more, and after discussions with the nobles, Cuauhtémoc began talks with the Spanish. After several failed peace overtures to Cuauhtémoc, Cortés ordered Sandoval to attack that part of the city in which Cuauhtémoc had retreated. As hundreds of canoes filled the lake fleeing the doomed city, Cortés sent his brigantines out to intercept them. Cuauhtémoc attempted to flee with his property, gold, jewels, and family in fifty pirogues, but was soon captured by Sandoval's launches, and brought before Cortés. The surrender \\"The Torture of Cuauhtémoc\\", a 19th-century painting by Leandro Izaguirre The Aztec forces were destroyed and the Aztecs surrendered on 13 August 1521, Julian Date. Cortés demanded the return of the gold lost during La Noche Triste. Under torture, by burning their feet with oil, Cuauhtémoc and the lord of Tacuba confessed to dumping his gold and jewels into the lake. Yet, little gold remained, as earlier, a fifth had been sent to Spain and another kept by Cortés. \\"In the end...the remaining gold all fell to the King's officials.\\" Cuauhtémoc was taken prisoner the same day, as related above, and remained the titular leader of Tenochtitlan, under the control of Cortés, until he was hanged for treason in 1525 while accompanying a Spanish expedition to Guatemala. Casualties and atrocities \\"The Last Days of Tenochtitlan, Conquest of Mexico by Cortez\\", a 19th-century painting by William de Leftwich Dodge. 100,000 to 240,000 were killed in the campaign overall including warriors and civilians. As many as 40,000 Aztecs bodies were floating in the canals or awaiting burial after the siege. Almost all of the Aztec nobility were dead, and the remaining survivors were mostly young women and very young children. At least 40,000 Aztecs civilians were killed and captured. After the Fall of Tenochtitlan the remaining Aztec warriors and civilians fled the city as the Spanish allies, primarily the Tlaxcalans, continued to attack even after the surrender, slaughtering thousands of the remaining civilians and looting the city. The Tlaxcalans did not spare women or children: they entered houses, stealing all precious things they found, raping and then killing women, stabbing children. The survivors marched out of the city for the next three days. One source claims 6,000 were massacred in the town of Ixtapalapa alone. Due to the wholesale slaughter after the campaign and the destruction of Aztec culture some sources such as Israel Charney, John C. Cox, and Norman Naimark have likened the siege to a genocide. Although some reports put the number as low as forty, the Spanish lost over 100 soldiers in the siege, while thousands of Tlaxcalans perished. It is estimated that around 1,800 Spaniards died from all causes during the two-year campaign—from Vera Cruz to Tenochtitlan. (Thomas, pp. 528–29) The remaining Spanish forces consisted of 800–900 Spaniards, eighty horses, sixteen pieces of artillery, and Cortés' thirteen brigantines. Other sources estimate that around 860 Spanish soldiers and 20,000 Tlaxcalan warriors were killed during all the battles in this region from 1519–1521. It is well accepted that Cortés' indigenous allies, which may have numbered as many as 200,000 over the three-year period of the conquest, were indispensable to his success.Black, Jeremy, ed.

The game is also variously known as Murder Wink, Killer, Murder in the Dark, Lonely Ghost and Killer Killer. The practical minimum number of players is four, but the spirit of the game is best captured by groups of at least six players or more. Gameplay In each round of play, one player is secretly assigned the role of \\"murderer\\", perhaps by handing every player a playing card with a particular card signifying that the recipient is the murderer. The murderer has the ability to \\"kill\\" other players by making eye contact and winking at them. If a player is winked at, they must count silently to five before feigning sudden death, and either lying on the floor where they died, or silently leaving the playing area. If a player suspects they know the identity of the murderer, they may raise their hand and announce \\"I accuse\\", without naming their suspect. At this point, the game pauses and the accuser asks for somebody to second their accusation, again with neither naming a suspect. When they have a seconder, both of these players simultaneously point to their suspect; if they are both pointing to a player who admits to being the murderer, the game ends. Otherwise (if they are pointing to different players, or to an innocent player) the accusers are both eliminated as if they had been murdered. Players are forbidden from communicating their thoughts on who the murderer might be, and players who are not the murderer are not allowed to wink. The objective of the murderer is to murder as many people as possible without being caught. Detective In one variant of the game, sometimes played by children as a class activity in elementary school, another player, unaware of the murderer's identity, is assigned the role of \\"detective\\". All other players sit in a circle around the detective, whose objective is to correctly identify and accuse the murderer, minimizing the number of murder victims. A limit is often imposed upon the number of accusations the detective can make. In this version of the game, players other than the murderer and detective do not know the murderer's identity, and have no role to play in the game other than to die noticeably if winked at. Harpo Marx in his book Harpo Speaks described a version of this game at the home of Alexander Woollcott, called \\"Murder\\". Lots are drawn to choose a District Attorney, then drawn a second time to choose (known only to him- or herself) a Murderer. The D.A. leaves the house and the social evening proceeds as normal. As soon as the Murderer is alone with someone, he says to that person \\"You are dead\\". The victim must immediately feign death until discovered, then the D.A. is summoned and questions the suspects (everyone) as to where they were, what they were doing, and with whom. The D.A. then uses deductive reasoning to solve the case. Marx said he played the Murderer once, and wrote the deadly phrase on a piece of toilet paper. His victim, Alice Duer Miller, pulled it down and properly \\"died\\" on the toilet, but grade-school dropout Marx was immediately identified when she was found; he had written \\"You are ded\\". Variations The \\"Deadly Handshake\\" variation has players walking around and routinely shaking hands as though greeting one another at a party, and the murderer kills by using a special handshake, such as tickling the victim's palm. It is recommended that victims do not \\"die\\" immediately, but take a few steps or shake hands with one or two other people before doing so. In \\"Lonely Ghost\\", a player may challenge the murderer (the \\"Lonely Ghost\\") by approaching them and asking them directly. In another variant of the basic game, a player may simply point to their suspect and call out their accusation. If the accuser is correct, they win the game, otherwise they are eliminated. In some variants, a wrongly accused player is also eliminated. \\"Cops and Robbers\\" is a drinking game variation of Wink murder. It uses the Ace and King to identify the \\"Cop\\" and the \\"Robber.\\" How a cop or a robber relates is not known. The game starts by using the same number of playing cards as players, including one Ace and one King. The rest of the cards are usually number cards which represent the number of seconds to drink. Play begins by shuffling the cards and laying them all face down. Each player grabs a card and keeps it to themselves. The player with the Ace is the player who winks to one other player. The player who got winked then says something like \\"The deal has been made.\\" Usually this player waits a few seconds before making that statement. Once \\"the deal has been made\\" the player with the King turns over their card and begins the \\"interrogation.\\" This player tries to guess who did the winking. As they choose a player, they turn over their card and if they did not have the Ace, the other player drinks the number on the card. If they correctly chose the player with the Ace, that player must finish their beverage. If the player with the Ace winks at the player with the King, an immediate \\"social\\" is called and everyone drinks. Because no one knows who will choose the Ace or King, all players are involved in either winking or looking for a wink. This can also be played with other drinking games like \\"drink, drank or drunk\\" to expedite the festivities. The \\"Slit Throat\\" variation has players walking around in the Dark, wandering the halls and rooms of a building. Identities are given out at the beginning with Ace of Spades as Murderer (depending on number of players, there can be multiple Murderers), Kings are Detectives (at least double the number of Murderers), all other cards are towns people (Town Mob). As people wander the halls, the Murderer kills people in the Dark by slitting their throat with a finger (or tapping them on the shoulder) and tells them where to lay down and die, the Murderer then walks away from the victim as they proceed to lie down. The Murderer may steal the Identity Card of the victims. All dead people must remain silent and can only answer YES if asked if they are dead. When somebody discovers a dead person they quickly move to turn on the nearest light and yell \\"Murder in the Dark\\". Then everybody comes to the room for a town meeting, including all people killed that round. A Detective may reveal him/herself to lead the meeting by showing off their badge (King Identity Card). During the meeting the townspeople tell the Detective what they saw and who they suspect. The Detective may then decide to accuse a player of being the Murderer or close the meeting and continue the game if they are not ready to do so. If a Detective accuses wrongly, (s)he is killed by the town mob and the next round begins. The town mob may also accuse by majority vote, but kill the accused when innocent. After a wrong accusation the game automatically goes on to the next round. The lights are turned off and people resume wandering through the building. During the town meetings the Murderer may lie as much as they want to fool the Detective and/or Town Mob. Only when properly accused the Murderer must admit to guilt and the game is over and (s)he loses. If the Murderer successfully kills off everybody, (s)he turns on the light and declares him/herself the winner and the game is over.

It is located in the Port Lands area of the Toronto waterfront at 470 Unwin Avenue, adjacent to the site of the decommissioned Hearn Generating Station. Corporate support The Portlands Energy Centre is owned and operated as a 50/50 joint partnership between Ontario Power Generation and TransCanada Corporation (now TC Energy). Technical specifications of the plant The technical specifications of the plant in the original submission of the environmental review report (a less rigorous form of a full environmental assessment) to the Ministry of the Environment in November 2003 have been significantly altered. This was due to the government instructing Ontario Power Generation to stop participating in projects which use more environmentally acceptable generations systems, such as co-generation.Memorandum of Agreement between the Crown and Ontario Power Generation, August 17, 2005 Originally, the plant was described as two identical 275 MW power train systems, each comprising a 175 MW GE 7FA gas turbine generator, and other equipment. This proposed configuration was capable of producing over 272,000 kilograms per hour of steam for district heating. This design would, according to a PEC newsletter, allow for the efficiency of the plant to be “about 55% compared to 35% for a typical fossil power plant” There were also plans to include “Canada’s largest solar array” capable of producing “hundreds of kilowatts” though no actual specification seems to have ever been given. Local opposition=Environmental issues The original design met with some community resistance and many local residents, all local politicians and a number of significant City of Toronto departments including the Works Department and the Board of Health. These groups called for a full Environmental Assessment (EA) as a way to resolve some of the technical and health related issues with the plant. The Ontario Liberal Government denied a full EA. Over time, the plan was altered significantly in a way that reduced the efficiency and aesthetic virtues of the plant. In November 2004, the proponents hosted a meeting to tell the community that the generation of steam for district heating was no longer going to happen and that the solar panels were no longer going to be included. It was also noted that the attempts to make the exterior of the plant aesthetically pleasing had been dropped in favour of a shed type design. Location issues The plant was met with considerable local opposition, since it was to be sited on the Waterfront, which is currently undergoing a revitalization process, and has been striving to be a “world leader in sustainable design” (according to the Corporation Chair, Robert Fung). The Ontario Liberal Government decided that, despite significant opposition, the project would be allowed to move forward without a full Environmental Assessment. The Toronto Waterfront Revitalization Corporation played a more neutral role, offering criticism of the plant but falling short of calling for a change of plans.

It is part of the non-amelogenins, which comprise 10% of the total enamel matrix proteins. It is one of the key proteins thought to be involved in amelogenesis (enamel development). The formation of enamel's intricate architecture is thought to be rigorously controlled in ameloblasts through interactions of various organic matrix protein molecules that include: enamelin, amelogenin, ameloblastin, tuftelin, dentine sialophosphoprotein, and a variety of enzymes. Enamelin is the largest protein (~168kDa) in the enamel matrix of developing teeth and is the least abundant (encompasses approximately 1-5%) of total enamel matrix proteins. It is present predominantly at the growing enamel surface.  Structure  Enamelin is thought to be the oldest member of the enamel matrix protein (EMP) family, with animal studies showing remarkable conservation of the gene phylogenetically. All other EMPs are derived from enamelin, such as amelogenin. EMPs belong to a larger family of proteins termed 'secretory calcium-binding phosphoproteins' (SCPP). Similar to other enamel matrix proteins, enamelin undergoes extensive post-translational modifications (mainly phosphorylation), processing, and secretion by proteases. Enamelin has three putative phosphoserines (Ser54, Ser191, and Ser216 in humans) phosphorylated by a Golgi-associated secretory pathway kinase (FAM20C) based on their distinctive Ser-x-Glu (S-x-E) motifs. The major secretory product of the ENAM gene has 1103 amino acids (post-secretion), and has an acidic isoelectric point ranging from 4.5–6.5 (depending on the fragment). At the secretory stage, the enzyme matrix metalloproteinase-20 (MMP20) proteolytically cleaves the secreted enamelin protein immediately upon release, into several smaller polypeptides; each having their own functions. However, the whole protein (~168 kDa) and its largest derivative fragment (~89 kDa) are undetectable in the secretory stage; these are existent only at the mineralisation front. Smaller polypeptide fragments remain embedded in the enamel, throughout the secretory stage enamel matrix. These strongly bind to the mineral and retard seeded crystal growth.  Function  The primary function of the proteins acts at the mineralisation front; growth sites where it is the interface between the ameloblast plasma membrane and lengthening extremity of crystals. The key activities of enamelin can be summarised: * Necessary for the adhesion of ameloblasts to the surface of the enamel in the secretory stage * Binds to hydroxyapatite and promotes crystallite elongation * Act as a modulator for de novo mineral formation It is speculated that this protein could interact with amelogenin or other enamel matrix proteins and be important in determining growth of the length of enamel crystallites. The mechanism of this proposed co-interaction is synergistic (\\"Goldilocks effect\\"). With enamelin enhancing the rates of crystal nucleation via the creation of addition sites for EMPs, such as amelogenin, to template calcium phosphate nucleation. It is best thought to understand the overarching function of enamelin as the proteins responsible for correct enamel thickness formation.  Clinical significance  Mutations in the ENAM gene can cause certain subtypes of amelogenesis imperfecta (AI), a heterogenous group of heritable conditions in which enamel in malformed. Point mutations can cause autosomal-dominant hypoplastic AI, and novel ENAM mutations can cause autosomal-recessive hypoplastic AI. However, mutations in the ENAM gene mainly tend to lead to the autosomal-dominant AI. The phenotype of the mutations are generalised thin enamel and no defined enamel layer. A moderately higher than usual ENAM expression leads to protrusive structures (often, horizontal grooves) on the surface of enamel, and with high transgene expression, the enamel layer is almost lost.

He was the first cousin once removed of the explorer and author Wilfred Thesiger (1910–2003), and the nephew of the 2nd Lord Chelmsford, who, exactly a week after Ernest's birth, famously led his troops in battle against – and suffered a defeat at the hands of – a Zulu army at the Battle of Isandlwana. Thesiger attended Marlborough College and the Slade School of Art with aspirations of becoming a painter, but quickly switched to drama, making his professional debut in a production of Colonel Smith in 1909. He also processed with the Men's League for Women's Suffrage at the mass rally in 1909. After the outbreak of World War I, on 31 August 1914, he volunteered with the British Army's Territorial Force, enlisting into the 2nd Battalion of the 9th London Regiment (Queen Victoria's Rifles), as Rifleman No.2546 at its Regimental Headquarters in London's West End. After training in England for three months, he was sent to the Western Front in late 1914 with the Q.V.R.'s 1st Battalion. On 1 January 1915, he was wounded in the trenches, and medically evacuated back to England.Thesiger's World War I Medal Index Card, The National Archive, Kew, Surrey, England, Order Code: WO 372/19/199216. http://discovery.nationalarchives.gov.uk/details/r/D5521869. His interest in needlework had begun with buying and repairing pieces of historical embroidery with his brother in law William Ranken whilst in France. After the incident in a barn explosion, his hands had been damaged and on return home, despite the Ministry of Pensions declaring it “too effeminate an occupation for men”, Thesiger developed small sewing kits for soldiers similarly injured to provide activity and pain relief. This became The Disabled Soldiers' Embroidery Industry, 42 Ebury Street, London. As Honorary Secretary Cross-Stitch, Thesiger was convinced that needlework could improve injured men's morale and earn some money, as he also obtained commissions, including an altar frontal for private use in Buckingham Palace. At a dinner party shortly after his return, someone asked him what it had been like in France, to which he is supposed to have responded \\"Oh, my dear, the noise! and the people!\\" In 1917, he married Janette Mary Fernie Ranken (1877–1970), sister of his close friend and fellow Slade graduate William Bruce Ellis Ranken. In her biography of Thesiger's friend, Ivy Compton-Burnett, Hilary Spurling suggests that Thesiger and Janette wed largely out of their mutual adoration of William, who shaved his head when he learned of the engagement. Another source states more explicitly that Thesiger made no secret of his bisexuality. Thesiger moved in several artistic, literary and theatrical circles, and is reported to have spent time with Queen Mary, both doing needlework and commenting on the sexuality of proposed honours nominees. At various times, he frequented the studio of John Singer Sargent, befriended Mrs. Patrick Campbell, visited and corresponded with Percy Grainger and worked closely with George Bernard Shaw, who wrote the role of the Dauphin in Saint Joan for him. Somerset Maugham, on the other hand, responded to Thesiger's inquiry as to why he wrote no parts for him with the quip, “But I am always writing parts for you, Ernest. The trouble is that somebody called Gladys Cooper will insist on playing them.” Thesiger was in the cast of Maugham's highly successful 1921 play The Circle, produced at the Haymarket Theatre (also with Fay Compton and Leon Quartermaine). Early stage career Thesiger first came to public notice in the farce A Little Bit of Fluff by Walter W. Ellis at the Criterion Theatre in 1915-18. He played the comic hero Bertrand Tully over 1,200 times, and received very favourable reviews. The London Standard wrote, “The character of Bertram Tully...is one of the happiest seen on the stage for a decade past...Mr. Ernest Thesiger achieved a real triumph.”Tyler, H Little Bit of Fluff”, Ernestthesiger.org, accessed 18 March 2018 He reprised the role in the 1919 film version, and in a 1923 revival at the Ambassadors Theatre. In 1925, Thesiger appeared in drag in Noël Coward's On with the Dance, and later played the Dauphin in Shaw's Saint Joan. He wrote an autobiography Practically True, published in 1927, which covers his stage career. An unpublished memoir written near the end of his life is housed in the Ernest Thesiger Collection at the University of Bristol Theatre Collection. Film career Thesiger made his film debut in 1916 in The Real Thing at Last, a spoof presenting Macbeth as it might be done by an American company, in which he did a drag turn as one of the Witches. Thesiger also played the First Witch in a 1941 production of Macbeth directed by John Gielgud. He performed more small roles in films during the silent era, but worked mainly on the stage. He had a larger role in an early film for director Alfred Hitchcock, the silent Number 13 (1922), but this was never completed due to lack of funds. =Work with James Whale= When he appeared in a Christmas production of The Merry Wives of Windsor in 1919, Thesiger met and befriended James Whale. After Whale moved to Hollywood and had found success with the films Journey's End (1930) and Frankenstein (1931), the director was commissioned to direct the screen adaptation of J. B. Priestley's Benighted as The Old Dark House (1932), starring Charles Laughton in his first American film, together with Boris Karloff and Raymond Massey. Whale immediately cast Thesiger in the film as Horace Femm, launching his Hollywood career. The following year Thesiger appeared (as a Scottish butler) with Karloff in a British film The Ghoul. When Whale agreed to direct Bride of Frankenstein in 1935, he insisted on casting Thesiger as Dr. Septimus Pretorius, instead of the studio's choice of Claude Rains. Partly inspired by Mary Shelley's friend John Polidori and largely based on the Renaissance physician and botanist Paracelsus, it became Thesiger's most famous role. Arriving in the United States for the filming of Bride of Frankenstein, Thesiger immediately set up a display in his hotel suite of all his needlework, each with a price tag, and during the making of the film he would work on needlework, one of his hobbies.\\"Ernest Thesiger - Expert Embroiderer 1944\\", British Pathé newsreel After Bride Originally cast to play the luddite sculptor Theotocopolous in H.G. Wells's Things to Come (1936), Thesiger's performance was deemed unsuitable by the author, and so was replaced by Cedric Hardwicke, although he was retained on the parallel production of Wells's The Man Who Could Work Miracles. Around this same time Thesiger published a book, Adventures in Embroidery, about needlework, which was his expert hobby. The remainder of Thesiger's career was centered on the theatrical stage, though he did appear in supporting roles in films produced in Britain, prominent among which is The Man in the White Suit (1951), starring Alec Guinness. He plays “Sir John,” the most powerful, the richest, and the oldest of the industrialists (jointly with the trade unions) trying to suppress Guinness's invention of a fabric that never wears out and never gets dirty. Thesiger made several appearances on Broadway, notably as Jacques to Katharine Hepburn's Rosalind in the longest-running production of As You Like It ever produced on Broadway. Later films included The Horse's Mouth (1958) with Alec Guinness, Sons and Lovers (1960), and The Roman Spring of Mrs. Stone, with Vivien Leigh and Warren Beatty (1961). That same year he made his final stage appearance—a mere week before his death—in The Last Joke, with John Gielgud and Ralph Richardson. Later life In 1960, Thesiger was awarded the Commander of the Order of the British Empire (CBE). He was Vice Patron of the Embroiderers Guild. His last film appearance was a small role in The Roman Spring of Mrs. Stone (1962). Shortly after completing it, Thesiger died in his sleep from natural causes on the eve of his 82nd birthday. His body was buried in Brompton Cemetery in London. Legacy In the fictionalised James Whale biopic Gods and Monsters (1998), Thesiger was portrayed by Arthur Dignam. And the real Thesiger is seen in the film when Brendan Fraser, as Whale's gardener, sits at a bar watching a televised showing of the original 1935 Bride of Frankenstein.

It is known for its annual festivals and its Etruscan archeological site. Geography Castiglion Fiorentino lies at the centre of a triangle formed by the cities of Florence, Siena and Perugia. Situated on a hilltop, above sea level, the town overlooks the Val di Chio and the Preappenines. Slightly more than 13,000 people live in the city (2013). The village of Manciano, known locally as \\"Misericordia\\", lies a mile to the west. History Due to the overall infrastructure, town walls, and building architecture, for many years scholars considered the town to have been established in the late medieval time frame. More recent excavations, however, have found the remains of an Etruscan city wall (c. 4th century BC) underneath the current Piazzale del Cassero, and have discovered the remains of an Etruscan temple under one of the town's churches, la chiesa di Sant'Angelo, which was built in the twelfth century. Documents from the 10th century mention a town named \\"Castiglione\\" in the feudal property of the Marquis of Monte Santa Maria. During the following century, the town became a part of the Diocese of Arezzo. From the 12th century the town was a free commune, until 1289 when, in the wake of the battle of Campaldino, it became part of the Republic of Florence. Arezzo and Siena joined forces against the Florentines in later years and reconquered Castiglione Aretino (as it was known then), which was then fortified under the direction of Bishop Guido Tarlati, Lord of Arezzo. Following Tarlati's death in 1336, Florence again gained control of Castiglione, until 1344, when it was acquired by Perugia, and renamed Castiglione Perugino. In 1369 the townspeople revolted against the Perugians, giving themselves to the Papal States; by 1384 the Florentines seized the town and bestowed its current name, Castiglione Fiorentino. During the 15th century, Castiglion Fiorentino suffered from repeated outbreaks of the plague, blamed at the time on the marshy areas surrounding the city. At the dawn of the 16th century, the Sienese army, led by Pietro Strozzi, gained control of the area, holding Castiglion Fiorentino until 1654, when the area became part of the Grand Duchy of Tuscany. For the next two hundred years, the Medici Grand Dukes ruled the city, until in 1765 the House of Lorraine gained power. The new dynasty encouraged the reclamation of marshlands, leading to a period of economic and population growth for Castiglion Fiorentino. From 1800 to 1814, the town was garrisoned by Napoleon's troops. After the Congress of Vienna in 1815, the town was returned to Tuscany, to which it remained until 1861, when the Grand Duchy was annexed to the newly created Kingdom of Italy. Military activity during World War II damaged part of the town center as well as much of the surrounding countryside. Main sights Views from Castiglion Fiorentino. The first of the existing city walls, including Porta Fiorentina, the main entrance to the town's historical center, was erected in the 13th century, then enlarged in the 14th under the Perugians to connect the castle to the outside walls. An anti-gate containing the Medici coat of arms is located outside of the walls, while the inside of the gate is constructed of three arches under a statue of the town's patron saint, St. Michael. The town's fortress, the Cassero, was completed in 1367. In the 15th century, the nuns of San Girolamo used the fortress as a convent, and by the 19th century much of the fortress had been destroyed, with the remaining structure used as a prison. The Pinacoteca, or Municipal Art Gallery, occupies the former church of Sant'Angelo. Built on the site of an Etruscan temple, the church of Sant'Angelo was built in Romanesque style between 1229 and 1239. The church has served as a hospital, wine cellar, and workshop before being renovated and used as an official museum and art gallery. In 1513 Vasari constructed a nine arch loggia (Logge del Vasari) in Piazza del Comune, overlooking the valley. The Logge were restored once between 1560 and 1570 and then again in the first part of the 20th century. Nearby is the Castello di Montecchio, which once was given to the British mercenary John Hawkwood. Culture Castiglion also has many festivals throughout the year including the famous \\"Palio dei Rioni\\" on the third Sunday of June. Similar to the festival in Siena, the Palio dei Rioni is a horse race around Piazza Garibaldi, including a colourful and energetic display of the ancient custom of flag-waving, which dates back to the 13th century. During the week leading up to Easter Sunday, the parade along the city's streets, re- enacting a scene from the Passion as they have done annually for the past four hundred years. In addition to the spring poppies, summer sunflowers and the famous Tuscan Cypress and Olive trees the beautiful green hillsides and country lanes are a must for any traveller any time of the year. Economy Much of the town's economy is based on agricultural and cattle ranching. Other residents are employed at pasta factories, sausage factories and sugarhouses. Some artisans create ceramics, and an additional 27% of the town's workers are employed by the service industry. Education Young children are educated at a school within the town. Older children attend secondary school in Arezzo. In June, 1989, Texas A&M; University opened the Santa Chiara Study Center in Castiglion Fiorentino. Approximately 100 students from Texas A&M; and other American universities, including Texas Tech University, University of Texas at Austin, Cal Poly Pomona, Colorado State University, University of Houston, and Kansas State University, study at Santa Chiara each semester, studying landscape architecture, art, architecture, literature, horticulture, music and international business. The Santa Chiara center is named after the building in which it is found, which is a former convent of the Order of Poor Clares. The building still contains the Church of Saint Clare (Santa Chiara in Italian), although it is now considered to be structurally unsound and is not used. Found on the southeast edge of town, the building has also been used as a girl's academy, but was vacant when Texas A&M; began to use the building which is operated by the Italart Cultural Association. The city of Castiglion Fiorentino owns and restored the building. Texas A&M; also sends some of its rising freshmen every summer, most of which are national scholars (National Merit Finalists and National Hispanic Scholars) for a two and a half week trip named the Memorial Student Center Champe Fitzhugh International Honors Leadership Seminar in Collaboration with the LAUNCH office at Texas A&M; University, College Station (formerly the Agricultural and Mechanical College of Texas) .

Function  Ameloblastin, also known as amelin, is a gene-specific protein found in tooth enamel. Although less than 5% of enamel consists of protein, ameloblastins comprise 5–10% of all enamel protein. This protein is formed by ameloblasts during the early secretory to late maturation stages of amelogenesis. Although not completely understood, the function of ameloblastins is believed to be in controlling the elongation of enamel crystals and generally directing enamel mineralization during tooth development. Other significant proteins in enamel are amelogenins, enamelins, and tuftelins. This gene encodes the nonamelogenin enamel matrix protein ameloblastin. The encoded protein may be important in enamel matrix formation and mineralization. This gene is located in the calcium-binding phosphoprotein gene cluster on chromosome 4. Mutations in this gene may be associated with dentinogenesis imperfecta and autosomal dominant amelogenesis imperfecta. [provided by RefSeq, Aug 2011].

The organization works mainly in the United States but also focuses on developing countries. The Guttmacher Institute uses studies to help support policy making and program reform. The Institute is named after obstetrician- gynocologist and the former president of Planned Parenthood, Alan F. Guttmacher. The Guttmacher Institute has many sources of funding nationally and internationally. One of the Institute's biggest projects is keeping a running list of the reproductive health laws and policies throughout the United States.  History  Founded in 1968, the Guttmacher Institute was originally called the Center for Family Planning Program Development and was a branch of Planned Parenthood. After Alan Guttmacher’s death, the Center for Family Planning Program Development was renamed and became an independent non- profit organization. In 2007, the organization officially split from Planned Parenthood.  Activities  The Guttmacher Institute continually updates its analysis of state and national laws and policies about contraception and abortion. The Institute keeps a record of the restrictions that different states have put in place for reproductive health. The organization also keeps data about how teens are affected by pregnancy and the number of teens who use contraception. Internationally, the Guttmacher Institute uses methodologies to give an approximation of abortions in places where the data is not as accessible or the abortions happen outside of the health care setting. In 2013, it was awarded a Population Center grant by the US National Institutes of Health in support of the Guttmacher Center for Population Research Innovation and Dissemination. The Guttmacher Institute has received Charity Navigator’s highest 4-star rating annually since 2010. In 2011 and 2013, the Institute was named the number one organization in the field of reproductive health by Philanthropedia.  Funding  The Institute was first started in 1968 as part of Planned Parenthood, with its funding being solely from Planned Parenthood. Once the Guttmacher Institute was no longer connected to Planned Parenthood in 2007, the organization only received less than 1% of its funding from Planned Parenthood in 2010. Now, most of the funding is gained through private foundations based in the United States. Other funding does come from international organizations such as the World Health Organization and the World Bank. The Guttmacher Institute was awarded $3.9 million between 1986 and 2015 by the MacArthur Foundation including 13 grants in population and reproductive health.  Bias  The Guttmacher Institute isn’t affiliated with a political party, and so it is nonpartisan in the strict sense of the word. It is true that the group does work to \\"ensure that all women are able to exercise their reproductive rights and responsibilities,\\" which puts them among advocates of abortion rights. However, according to Factcheck.org, Guttmacher \\"provides the most highly respected statistics on the sexual health of women and men. Its figures on abortion are widely cited by the media as well as by groups on both sides of the political aisle.\\" See also Sharon Camp, former CEO ReferencesExternal links * Official website * Guttmacher Institute records at the Sophia Smith Collection, Smith College Category:Dupont Circle Category:Medical research institutes in the United States Category:Non-profit organizations based in Washington, D.C.

Born in Kansas City, Missouri, Wittig became a Wall Street investment banker. In 1995, Wittig, having earned millions in New York, was asked to return to Kansas as an executive at Western Resources (later renamed Westar Energy) by John E. Hayes, then CEO of Western and a customer of Wittig's at Salomon Brothers. At that time, Warren Buffett had taken over Salomon in the wake of a trading scandal \\"and decided to cut the exorbitant compensation of the firm’s managing directors.\\" Wittig accepted the Western invitation, and was named President in 1998 and Chairman and CEO in January 1999. He quickly became one of Topeka's most prominent citizens and was a generous contributor to local charities. Wittig supported the Multi-cultural Business Scholars Program at the University of Kansas and established a $250,000 scholarship in his family's name. He then purchased and renovated the mansion of former Kansas governor Alf Landon, the 1936 presidential nominee of the Republican Party. Wittig's remodeling of the home (appraised at roughly $2 million, compared to the median Topeka single family home value of $125,000) later became subject to much controversy. Among other unconventional initiatives taken by Wittig at Westar, he \\"bought around 30 percent of ADT, the home-security company, and then sold it for a pre-tax profit of $865 million to Tyco, making more for the staid utility in one year than it had made in many.\\" In 2002, it was revealed that there was some evidence that a Topeka banker had entered into an illegal loan with Wittig. The banker, Clinton (Del) Weidner, well known in Topeka for his charitable efforts, had informed Wittig that he was considering investing in a property development in Arizona and was in need of a $1.5 million loan to make a proper investment in the venture. Wittig loaned Weidner $1.5 million and Weidner increased the bank's line of credit to Wittig, ultimately by $2 million. The two men faced trial in 2003, and both were found guilty as charged. In February 2004, Weidner was sentenced to six years and six months in a federal prison in North Dakota. Wittig that same month was sentenced to four years in prison and fined $1 million. Concurrent with the loan to Weidner becoming public, Wittig and corporate strategy vice president Douglas Lake resigned from Westar amid charges of \\"looting\\" the utility company. Prosecutors contended that the two men had unjustly compensated themselves and used the company jet for non-business-related matters. The two men were put to trial on 39 charges in fall 2004. The tide seemed to be in favor of the prosecution, but the trial ended with a hung jury in December. A retrial with an added 40th charge was conducted during the late summer of 2005. On September 12, Wittig was convicted of 39 counts while Lake was convicted of 30; both were convicted of the 40th charge, forfeiture, later that week. On April 4, 2006, US District Judge Julie Robinson sentenced Wittig to 18 years and ordered him to pay a $5 million fine in addition to $14.5 million in restitution. Wittig faced a maximum of 455 years behind bars and intended to appeal. On January 5, 2007, the 10th U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals overturned the convictions of Wittig and Lake in the Westar Energy case. Wittig was freed from prison on February 12, 2007. Wittig was scheduled to be retried for the third time for looting Westar in September 2008. With delays, in July 2010, the new trial was set to begin September 20. However, the trial judge first was \\"expected to rule whether to proceed at all (and, if so, on what basis), in light of the Supreme Court’s ruling [in June] on the conviction of the former Enron executive Jeffrey Skilling, which appears to limit the government’s use of the so-called honest services statute to seek convictions in corruption cases.

Cohan, The New York Times \\"Opinionator\\" blog, July 22, 2010, 9:06 pm. Retrieved 2010-07-23. In 2010 all charges against Wittig were dismissed. In July, 2011, Wittig settled a dispute with Weststar Energy for back compensation owed him. The settlement amount received by Wittig was $36,000,000 in cash, $3,100,000 in legal fees incurred by Wittig, and $2,700,000 in stock compensation.

In humans, the Tuftelin protein is encoded by the TUFT1 gene. It is an acidic protein that is thought to play a role in dental enamel mineralization and is implicated in caries susceptibility. It is also thought to be involved with adaptation to hypoxia, mesenchymal stem cell function, and neurotrophin nerve growth factor mediated neuronal differentiation.  Classification  There are two kinds of enamel proteins: Amelogenins & Nonamelogenins. Tuftelin falls under nonamelogenins.  Function  This protein is formed for a short time during amelogenesis. The function of tuftelins is under contention, but it is proposed that it acts to start the mineralization process of enamel during tooth development. Other significant proteins in enamel are amelogenins, enamelins, and ameloblastins.  Research  The human encoding gene for tuftelin (TUFT1) was cloned by Profs.

Then, she met Kimberly Page and she joined WCW's original Nitro Girls as Fyre on July 14, 1997, and stayed with them until 1999. She then opened a website as a model but shut it down after a couple of years. She appeared in a non-nude Nitro Girls pictorial in the September 1998 issue of Penthouse, along with Melissa Bellin, Chae An, and Kimberly Page. After the demise of the Nitro Girls in 2000, she was a member of the pop music group Diversity 5 with some other former Nitro Girls. Other media In 2001 she was actively involved with the development of a comic book entitled \\"Stiletto\\" about a bounty hunter portrayed by Teri. The book, published by Gypsy Press Comics, was originally to be titled \\"Nytro\\", but Turner Broadcasting would not allow them to use anything associated with their WCW franchise. Issue #1 of Stiletto formally debuted at the 2001 Wizard World Chicago convention on August 17, 2001. Personal life Byrne grew up in Atlanta and spent a lot of time in the stables in which her father raised Arabian horses. She devoted much of her time to speaking out against cruelty to animals and the inhumane treatment of greyhounds and saddlebred horses. Byrne later graduated from Arizona State University with Honors in Communication. Byrne lives in Charlotte, North Carolina. For the last nine years, she has worked for the University of Phoenix: two years in Atlanta as Enrollment Manager, then three years in Augusta, Georgia as director of enrollment before becoming regional director of enrollment for the Southeast region. Byrne still loves animals and enjoys spending time with her Belgian Draft Horse, a rescue. She believes very strongly in healthy living, and is a vegetarian and a yoga enthusiast.

These planes of relative weakness are a result of the regular locations of atoms and ions in the crystal, which create smooth repeating surfaces that are visible both in the microscope and to the naked eye.Hurlbut, Cornelius S.; Klein, Cornelis, 1985, Manual of Mineralogy, 20th ed., Wiley,  Types of cleavage  Miller indices {h k ℓ} Cleavage forms parallel to crystallographic planes: *Basal or pinacoidal cleavage occurs when there is only one cleavage plane. Graphite has basal cleavage. Mica (like muscovite or biotite) also has basal cleavage; this is why mica can be peeled into thin sheets. *Cubic cleavage occurs on when there are three cleavage planes intersecting at 90 degrees. Halite (or salt) has cubic cleavage, and therefore, when halite crystals are broken, they will form more cubes. *Octahedral cleavage occurs when there are four cleavage planes in a crystal. Fluorite exhibits perfect octahedral cleavage. Octahedral cleavage is common for semiconductors. Diamond also has octahedral cleavage. *Rhombohedral cleavage occurs when there are three cleavage planes intersecting at angles that are not 90 degrees. Calcite has rhombohedral cleavage. *Prismatic cleavage occurs when there are two cleavage planes in a crystal. Spodumene exhibits prismatic cleavage. *Dodecahedral cleavage occurs when there are six cleavage planes in a crystal. Sphalerite has dodecahedral cleavage.  Parting  Crystal parting occurs when minerals break along planes of structural weakness due to external stress or along twin composition planes. Parting breaks are very similar in appearance to cleavage, but only occur due to stress. Examples include magnetite which shows octahedral parting, the rhombohedral parting of corundum and basal parting in pyroxenes.  Uses  Cleavage is a physical property traditionally used in mineral identification, both in hand specimen and microscopic examination of rock and mineral studies. As an example, the angles between the prismatic cleavage planes for the pyroxenes (88–92°) and the amphiboles (56–124°) are diagnostic. Crystal cleavage is of technical importance in the electronics industry and in the cutting of gemstones. Precious stones are generally cleaved by impact, as in diamond cutting. Synthetic single crystals of semiconductor materials are generally sold as thin wafers which are much easier to cleave. Simply pressing a silicon wafer against a soft surface and scratching its edge with a diamond scribe is usually enough to cause cleavage; however, when dicing a wafer to form chips, a procedure of scoring and breaking is often followed for greater control. Elemental semiconductors (Si, , and diamond) are diamond cubic, a space group for which octahedral cleavage is observed. This means that some orientations of wafer allow near-perfect rectangles to be cleaved. Most other commercial semiconductors (GaAs, InSb, etc.) can be made in the related zinc blende structure, with similar cleavage planes.

As the wife of Booker T, she is best known for her time with World Wrestling Entertainment (WWE) as Queen Sharmell until her release in 2007. She first came to prominence in the wrestling world as Storm a member of the World Championship Wrestling dance troupe the Nitro Girls and she also played a character called Paisley. Sullivan-Huffman performed for Total Nonstop Action Wrestling (TNA) under the ring name Sharmell from 2007 until leaving the company in 2009. Early life and education Sullivan was valedictorian of Roosevelt High School in Gary, Indiana, in 1988, and graduated from Spelman College in Atlanta, Georgia in 1997 with a degree in mathematics. Miss Black America At age 20, Sullivan won the 1991 Miss Black America pageant (she was Miss Black Indiana), which was marred by accusations of rape by Miss Black Rhode Island, Desiree Washington, against pageant judge Mike Tyson. After winning the title, Sullivan began a career in professional dance, touring with several hip hop artists and R&B; bands, including a 3½ year stint with James Brown. Professional wrestling career=World Championship Wrestling (1998–2001) Sullivan joined World Championship Wrestling's Nitro Girl dance troupe in December 1998 under the name Storm. When the Nitro Girls began becoming more involved in WCW storylines, she was made the valet for The Artist, re-dubbing herself Paisley. As Paisley, she made her in-ring singles debut against Tammy Lynn Sytch on the April 26, 2000, episode of WCW Thunder, winning with a DDT. Following The Artist's release from WCW, Sullivan began valeting for Kwee Wee. She also formed an alliance with fellow former Nitro Girl Tygress, and the two ladies frequently double-teamed the Misfits In Action's valet Major Gunns. While in WCW, Sullivan was also a part of the pop music group Diversity 5 with other Nitro Girls Fyre, Spice, Chae, and Tygress. In 2001, when she signed with the WWF, she was replaced in the group by Chiquita Anderson (also a Nitro Girl). World Wrestling Federation/Entertainment (2001–2002; 2005–2007) In 2001, just before WCW was bought by the World Wrestling Federation (WWF), Sullivan was released from WCW and signed a developmental contract with WWF with the intent of becoming a full-time in-ring performer and backstage interviewer. She was sent to Ohio Valley Wrestling to continue her training, and was made the valet for The Suicide Blondes, wearing a blonde wig and using the name Sister Sharmell. Her training, however, was cut short by an injury, forcing her to retire from in- ring work. In November 2001, Sullivan was called up and put in a backstage interview position on SmackDown!, which lasted until sometime in early 2002 before the company was renamed World Wrestling Entertainment.http://www.onlineworldofwrestling.com/bios/s/sharmell/ She retired from wrestling afterwards to run a clothing store in Houston, Texas. Sullivan was re-hired by the (now renamed) World Wrestling Entertainment in the spring of 2005, debuting as a face valet for her real-life husband Booker T. Together they took part in a feud with Kurt Angle, during which Angle continually sexually harassed Sharmell. Sharmell began turning heel in October when she started interfering in Booker's matches, presumably without his knowledge. Her heel turn was cemented she helped Booker win the United States Championship from Chris Benoit on the October 21 episode of SmackDown!, which preceded a heel turn by Booker the following week when he revealed he knew of her involvement in his matches the entire time. Sharmell and Booker T then began a feud with The Boogeyman, and during a handicap match at WrestleMania 22 The Boogeyman managed to kiss Sharmell while he had a mouth full of worms before winning the match. After Booker T's victory in the 2006 King of the Ring tournament, Booker T began referring to himself as \\"King Booker\\" and Sharmell as \\"Queen Sharmell\\". As part of their new on-screen personas, the duo began speaking in faux British accents and acting pompous. On the April 6, 2007, episode of SmackDown! Sharmell turned on King Booker, claiming his failure to defeat Matt Hardy that night—after Hardy had nearly attacked her during WrestleMania 23—meant Booker did not care about her honor. Later that night, as part of the storyline, Booker tried to impress Sharmell by attacking World Heavyweight Champion The Undertaker which ended in Booker being hit with a Tombstone Piledriver on the announce table and sprained Booker's neck, which put him out of action. On the June 11 episode of Raw, Sharmell and King Booker were drafted from SmackDown! to Raw as part of the WWE Draft. Due to conflicts with storyline and overall character direction, in October 2007, Sharmell, along with Booker, requested and were granted their releases from their contracts by WWE. She then made an appearance at the 2013 WWE Hall Of Fame to watch her husband get inducted. Total Nonstop Action Wrestling (2007–2009) Booker T and Sharmell (left) in Total Nonstop Action Wrestling At the Genesis pay per view on November 11, 2007, Sharmell debuted in TNA during the TNA World Heavyweight Championship match attacking Karen Angle. At Final Resolution on January 6, 2008, Sharmell and Booker T were booked into a mixed tag team match against Robert Roode and Ms. Brooks and won after she rolled-up Ms. Brooks. After the match, Roode was arguing with Ms. Brooks when Sharmell came back to stop Roode only to get hit in the face and kayfabe breaking her jaw. She made her return at Destination X, after the Booker T and Roode match, whipping Payton Banks and Roode. On April 13 at Lockdown, she and husband, Booker T defeated Robert Roode and Payton Banks. Sharmell was inactive following Booker's heel turn, but returned at Victory Road during the main event between Samoa Joe and her husband. She established herself as a heel during the match by making the three-count, allowing her husband to \\"win\\" the TNA World Heavyweight Championship. When Booker joined The Main Event Mafia in October 2008, Sharmell followed suit. On the November 20 edition of Impact!, Sharmell was challenged to a match with ODB at Final Resolution, which she accepted. Along with The Beautiful People, Sharmell fell to the team of ODB, Taylor Wilde, and Roxxi at Final Resolution. Sharmell was regularly seen bickering with fellow Mafia valet Jenna Morasca, leading to a catfight backstage on the May 28 edition of Impact! which led to Sharmell challenging Morasca to a match at Victory Road. She lost the match at Victory Road after Kong knocked her out then Morasca pinned her. She then competed in the TNA Knockout Tag Title tournament teaming with Traci Brooks to represent The Main Event Mafia, but they lost in the first round of the tournament to Awesome Kong and Raisha Saeed. At Bound for Glory Booker and Sharmell made their final appearance for TNA, before leaving the company. Other media During the week of November 5, 2007, she appeared on five episodes of Family Feud with Batista, Candice Michelle, Booker T, Mr. Kennedy, Layla El, Michelle McCool, Maria, Ric Flair, and Jonathan Coachman. Personal life Sullivan has a stepson Brandon, from Huffman's first marriage.Stated in the March 2005 issue of WWE RAW Magazine and in the book WWE Unscripted. She and Huffman began dating while they both worked for WCW. The couple were married in February 2005. Sullivan gave birth to twins, a boy and a girl, on August 5, 2010.

A History of Russia. New Haven. Connecticut: Yale University Press. 1961. online The family acquired great influence and wealth in the Polish–Lithuanian Commonwealth during the 16th century. History The first confirmed records of the Sapieha family date back to the 15th century, when Semen Sopiha () was mentioned as a writer (scribe) of the then King of Poland and Grand Duke of Lithuania, Casimir IV Jagiellon () for the period of 1441–49. Semen had two sons, Bohdan and Iwan. Possibly, the family of Semen Sopiha owned the village of Sopieszyno near Gdansk, which they left because of the Teutonic invasion. Sopieszyno is one of the oldest Pomeranian villages. The records have it that already in the 11th-12th centuries it was a knightly estate. It was then mentioned in 1399 as a village owned in fiefdom by knights subject to the Polish Crown. Their family could be involved in the Baltic-Volga trade, as many Pomeranian families. It is archeologically evident that the Western Dvina was part of the trade route from the Varangians to the Arabs. Their family's appearance near Smolensk corresponds to that. The creator of the fortune and power of the Sapieha family was the Court and Great Chancellor and Great Hetman of Lithuania, Lew Sapieha. The princely title of the Sapieha-Kodenski branch was recognized in Poland in 1572 and in Austria-Hungary in 1845, while that of the Sapieha-Rozanski line was officially acknowledged in Russia in 1880.Enache, Nicolas. La Descendance de Marie-Therese de Habsburg. ICC, Paris, 1996. pp. 72, 80-81. (French). On 14 September 1700, Michał Franciszek Sapieha had obtained the title of prince from Emperor Leopold I, but the title became extinct upon his death on 19 November 1700. That year, the family lost its dominant position in the Grand Duchy as a result of its defeat in the Lithuanian Civil War. In 1768, members of the Sapieha family obtained recognition of the princely title from the Polish Sejm. After the partitions of Poland, the family appeared in the list of persons authorised to bear the title of Prince of the Kingdom of Poland in 1824. The title was recognised in Austria in 1836 and 1840, and in Russia in 1874 and 1901. In 1905, the family obtained the qualification of Serene Highness in Austria. The maternal grandmother of Queen Mathilde of Belgium was a Princess of the house of Sapieha.

Set in three time periods, 1935 England, Second World War England and France, and present-day England, it covers an upper-class girl's half-innocent mistake that ruins lives, her adulthood in the shadow of that mistake, and a reflection on the nature of writing. Widely regarded as one of McEwan's best works, it was shortlisted for the 2001 Booker Prize for fiction. In 2010, TIME magazine named Atonement in its list of the 100 greatest English-language novels since 1923. In 2007, the book was adapted into a BAFTA and Academy Award-winning film of the same title, starring Saoirse Ronan, James McAvoy, and Keira Knightley, and directed by Joe Wright. Plot summary=Part one Briony Tallis, a 13-year-old English girl with a talent for writing, lives at her family's country estate with her parents Jack and Emily Tallis. Her older sister Cecilia has recently graduated from the University of Cambridge with Robbie Turner, the Tallis family housekeeper's son and Cecilia's childhood friend (Robbie received a first in English while Cecilia received a \\"humiliating third\\"), with whom she eventually develops a relationship. In the summer of 1935, Briony's maternal cousins, Lola and her twin brothers Jackson and Pierrot, visit the family after their parents are going through a bitter divorce. Briony's immaturity, and her inability to grasp certain situations which are beyond her understanding, lead her to misinterpret a scene she witnesses of a struggle between Robbie and Cecilia. What she believes to be a moment of sexual tension between Cecilia and Robbie is far from the reality of the situation and is the spark that begins Briony's fantasies. Briony misconstrues this situation and concludes that Robbie is acting aggressively toward Cecilia, due to their differences in gender and Briony's idea of male dominance over women. Robbie, meanwhile, begins to realise he has developed an attraction towards Cecilia, whom he has not seen in some time, and writes several drafts of a love letter to her expressing the feelings he has for her. He decides to give the letter to Briony to deliver to Cecilia for him; however, he inadvertently gives her a version he had meant to discard, which contains lewd and vulgar references (\\"In my dreams I kiss your cunt\\"). It becomes too late for Robbie to rectify his mistake and despite his instructions to Briony not to open the letter she disobeys him and reads it. Later the same evening, she walks in on Robbie and Cecilia having sex in the library. Briony misinterprets this as an assault and believes Robbie is a \\"maniac\\" from whom she must protect her sister. Later, there is a family dinner party attended by Briony's brother Leon and his friend Paul Marshall. When it is discovered the twins have run away, the party breaks into teams to search for them. In the darkness, while everyone is searching for the twins, Briony discovers her cousin Lola being raped by an assailant she cannot clearly see. Lola is unable/unwilling to identify the attacker. Briony accuses Robbie and identifies him to the police as the rapist, claiming she has seen his face in the dark. Her previous misinterpretations of seeing Robbie and Cecilia's struggle at the fountain, the letter, and the scene she witnesses in the library, lead Briony to accuse Robbie of raping Lola, despite having no solid proof that he was responsible. Robbie is taken away to prison, with only Cecilia and his mother believing his protestations of innocence. Briony perceives her actions to be heroic, fulfilling her fantasies of the criminal being locked up. As a result of this, Cecilia cuts off her family and refuses to speak to them again. Part two By the time Second World War has started, Robbie has spent several years in prison. He is released on the condition he enlists in the army. Cecilia has trained and become a nurse. She has cut off all contact with her family because of the part they played in sending Robbie to jail. Robbie and Cecilia have only been in contact by letter, since she was not allowed to visit him in prison. Before Robbie has to go to war in France, they meet once for half an hour, during Cecilia's lunch break. Their reunion starts awkwardly, but they share a kiss before leaving each other. In France, the war is going badly, and the army is retreating to Dunkirk. As the injured Robbie makes his way there, he thinks about Cecilia and past events such as teaching Briony how to swim, reflecting on Briony's possible reasons for accusing him. His single meeting with Cecilia is the memory that keeps him walking; his only aim is seeing her again. His condition deteriorates over the course of the section: He weakens and becomes delirious. At the end of part two, Robbie falls asleep in Dunkirk, one day before the evacuation begins. Part three Remorseful Briony has refused her place at Cambridge and instead is a trainee nurse in London. She has realised the full extent of her mistake and decides it was Paul Marshall, Leon's friend, whom she saw raping Lola. Briony still writes, although she does not pursue it with the same recklessness as she did as a child. Briony is called to the bedside of Luc, a young, fatally wounded French soldier. She consoles him in his last moments by speaking with him in her school French, and he mistakes her for an English girl whom his mother wanted him to marry. Just before his death, Luc asks, \\"Do you love me?\\" Briony replies, \\"Yes,\\" not only because \\"no other answer was possible\\" but also because \\"for the moment, she did. He was a lovely boy far away from his family and about to die.\\" Afterward, Briony daydreams about the life she might have had if she had married Luc and gone to live with him and his family. Briony attends the wedding of Paul Marshall and her cousin Lola — who has decided to marry her rapist — before finally visiting Cecilia. Robbie is on leave from the army, and Briony meets him unexpectedly at her sister's. Cecilia and Robbie both refuse to forgive Briony, who nonetheless tells them she will try to put things right. She promises to begin the legal procedures needed to exonerate Robbie, even though Paul Marshall will never be held responsible for his crime because of his marriage to Lola, the victim. Postscript The final section, titled \\"London 1999,\\" is narrated by Briony herself in the form of a diary entry. Now 77, she is a successful novelist who has recently been diagnosed with vascular dementia, so she is facing rapid mental decline and death. The reader learns that Briony is the author of the preceding sections of the novel. On the penultimate page, Briony reveals that Robbie Turner died of septicaemia — caused by his injury — on the beaches of Dunkirk, that Cecilia was killed when a bomb destroyed Balham Underground station during the Blitz, and Briony never saw them in 1940. Briony did attend Lola's wedding to Marshall, but confesses she was too \\"cowardly\\" to visit the \\"recently bereaved\\" Cecilia to make amends. The novel — which she says is factually true apart from Robbie and Cecilia being reunited — is her lifelong attempt at \\"atonement\\" for what she did to them. Briony justifies her invented happy ending by saying she does not see what purpose it would serve to give readers a \\"pitiless\\" story. She writes, \\"I like to think that it isn't weakness or evasion, but a final act of kindness, a stand against oblivion and despair, to let my lovers live and to unite them at the end.\\" Main characters * Briony Tallis – The younger sister of Leon and Cecilia Tallis, Briony is an aspiring writer. She is a thirteen-year-old at the beginning of the novel and takes part in sending Robbie Turner to jail when she falsely claims that he assaulted Lola. Briony is part narrator, part character and we see her transformation from child to woman as the novel progresses. At the end of the novel, Briony has realised her wrongdoing as a \\"child\\" and decides to write the novel to find atonement. * Cecilia Tallis – The middle child in the Tallis family, Cecilia has fallen in love with her childhood companion, Robbie Turner. After a tense encounter by the fountain, she and Robbie don't speak again until they meet before a formal dinner. When Robbie is falsely accused of rape shortly after, Cecilia loses her love to jail and war, and chooses not to contact any members of her family again. * Leon Tallis – The eldest child in the Tallis family, Leon returns home to visit. He brings his friend Paul Marshall along with him on his trip home. * Emily Tallis – Emily is the mother of Briony, Cecilia, and Leon. Emily is ill in bed for most of the novel, suffering from severe migraines. * Jack Tallis – Jack is the father of Briony, Cecilia, and Leon. Jack often works late nights and it is alluded to in the novel that he is having an affair. * Robbie Turner – Robbie is the son of Grace Turner, who lives on the grounds of the Tallis home. Having grown up with Leon, Briony and Cecilia, he knows the family well. He attended Cambridge University with Cecilia and when they come home on break, they fall in love. Robbie is sent to jail when Briony falsely accuses him of raping Lola. * Grace Turner – The mother of Robbie Turner, she was given permission from Jack Tallis to live on the grounds. She has become the family's maid and does laundry for the Tallises. When her son is falsely accused of raping Lola, only she and Cecilia believe he is innocent, and Grace chooses to leave the Tallis family. * Dolores ‘Lola’ Quincey – A 15-year-old girl who is Briony, Cecilia, and Leon's cousin. She comes, along with her twin brothers, to stay with the Tallises after her parents' divorce. Lola was supposed to assume the main role in Briony's play, until it was cancelled. She is also subject to rape while staying at the Tallis household. Lola appears later in the novel as a mature woman, married to Paul Marshall. She is red-headed and fair-skinned with freckles. * Jackson and Pierrot Quincey – Lola's younger twin brothers and Briony, Cecilia, and Leon's cousin. They come, along with their sister, to stay with the Tallises after their parents' divorce. Briony wants the twins to take a role in her play, but disputes mean the play is cancelled, upsetting them both. Pierrot appears later in the novel as an old man while his brother has died. * Danny Hardman – The handyman for the Tallis family. Robbie and Cecilia suspect he is responsible for Lola's rape until Briony tells them otherwise, prompting Robbie to say they owe him an apology. * Paul Marshall – A friend of Leon. He rapes Lola outside the Tallis household after dark; Briony, however, accuses Robbie of Lola's rape, and many years later Lola and Paul marry. Paul Marshall also owns a chocolate factory that manufactures 'Amo' bars – fake chocolate energy bars supplied to army troops, which earn him a considerable fortune. * Corporal Nettle – Nettle is one of Robbie's two companions during the Dunkirk evacuation. In the fourth and final section of the novel, an elderly Briony alludes to an \\"old Mr. Nettle\\" from whom she received a \\"dozen long letters\\" but whether this is the same person isn't made exactly clear. * Corporal Mace – Mace is the second of Robbie's two companions during the Dunkirk evacuation. He is last seen presumably rescuing an RAF man from a possible lynching by some infantrymen under the guise of wanting to do harm by drowning him in the \\"bloody sea.\\" * Betty – The Tallis family's servant, described as \\"wretched\\" in personality.

Controversy In late 2006, romance and historical author Lucilla Andrews said that McEwan had failed to give her sufficient credit for material on wartime nursing in London sourced from her 1977 autobiography No Time for Romance. McEwan professed innocence of plagiarism while acknowledging his debt to the author. McEwan had included Andrews among the acknowledgements in the book, and several authors defended him, including John Updike, Martin Amis, Margaret Atwood, Thomas Keneally, Zadie Smith, and the reclusive Thomas Pynchon.

Unlike the original Usenet, it was peered only between \\"sound sites\\" and employed a system of rules to keep out spam. Usenet II was backed by influential Usenetters like Russ Allbery. Sometime between 2010 and 2011,https://web.archive.org/web/20110514011614/http://www.usenet2.org/ the web page for Usenet II went offline. The newsgroup hierarchy in Usenet II revived the old naming system used by Usenet before the Great Renaming. All groups had names starting \\"net.\\", which serve to distinguish them from the \\"Big 8\\" (misc.*, sci.*, news.*, rec.*, soc.*, talk.*, comp.*, humanities.*). A separate checkgroup system, using the same technical mechanism as the one produced by David C. Lawrence for the Big 8, enforced the Usenet II hierarchy and prevents the creation of unauthorized newsgroups within it. The basic principles of operation were controlled by a Steering Committee, which appointed \\"hierarchy czars\\" who were responsible for the content of specific portions of the namespace, or hierarchies. Usenet II had strictly enforced rules. Readers of messages in Usenet II had to be fully compliant with the RFC 1036 (Usenet) standard plus some additional format compliance rules that were specific to Usenet II. A message header had to contain a valid email address in the From field. It was required to have an NNTP-Posting-Host header field containing a sound site. The distribution field was to be set to \\"4gh\\" (a reference to Shockwave Rider by John Brunner). If the Subject field started with \\"Re:\\", indicating a follow-up, there had to be a valid \\"References\\" field that contained the Message-ID of a previous message. Crossposts to groups outside the net.* hierarchy were cancelled automatically. No message were allowed to spawn a discussion in more than three newsgroups. This applied both to the \\"newsgroups\\" field and the \\"Followup-To\\" field. It was permissible to post the same message three times. Posting the same message every day or every week was not permitted. The effort to extend Usenet II was abandoned as technical means to fight spam and other abuse on traditional Usenet became more effective and spammers migrated from Usenet to email.

She was born during a failed saline abortion attempt. The 2011 film October Baby was loosely based on Jessen's life. Early life Jessen was born April 6, 1977 in Los Angeles, California. Her medical records indicate that she was born in the 30th week of pregnancy to a 17-year-old girl during a failed saline abortion. Jessen's birth certificate is signed by the doctor who was performing the abortion. Jessen weighed at birth, and was born with cerebral palsy, a motor condition that affects various areas of body movement, which she says was caused by the abortion attempt. She describes it as a \\"tremendous gift\\". Jessen spent three months in the hospital before being placed in foster care. She was adopted at the age of four. Career=1990s Jessen's career as an activist began in 1991, when she was 14, after her adoptive mother, Diana DePaul, told Jessen she was born to a 17-year-old girl, during a failed abortion attempt. Jessen has since campaigned against abortion, saying \\"It's more comfortable for people to think of abortion as a political decision, or a right. But I am not a right. I am a human being\\". Jessen said she's forgiven her birth mother, but is not interested in a relationship with her, citing a strong relationship with her adoptive mother. Jessen has also campaigned against exceptions to late-term abortion laws, on the grounds of fetal disability, citing her own disability. Jessen appeared on the Maury Povich Show with her adoptive mother in 1991. In reporting her story and publicizing Jessen's early life to the nation, The New York Times observed that Jessen and Becky Bell, a teenage girl who reportedly died as a result of a botched unsafe abortion in 1988, had become the symbols of America's debate over abortion and characterized them as \\"poster girls whose stories are being shrewdly marketed by their supporters to keep passions high.\\" Jessen is a stage name that was adopted when she began her activism. In 1995, four years after Jessen was placed in the national spotlight, author Jessica Shaver published a biography on Jessen. In early 1996, Festival of Light Australia sponsored an Australian tour,\\"Gianna - glad to be alive\\". Light. Australian Festival of Light and Community Standards Organisation, February 1996. p 12. during which Jessen spoke at venues in all states and territories.\\"How the media saw Gianna\\". Light. Australian Festival of Light and Community Standards Organisation. May 1996. p. 12. 2000s In his speech at the 2002 signing of the Born-Alive Infants Protection Act President George W. Bush mentioned Jessen, acknowledging her presence and extending his appreciation. In December 2005 Jessen travelled to London to support a campaign to reduce the number of abortions under the UK Abortion Act and to speak at a parliamentary meeting at the House of Commons. Both the Archbishop of Canterbury and the Archbishop of Westminster indicated that they hoped her story would encourage Parliament to look again at abortion. On May 8, 2006, the Colorado State House of Representatives considered a resolution honoring the 90th anniversary of a local branch of Planned Parenthood. Republican representative Ted Harvey invited Jessen to sing the national anthem to the House that day and then told her story \\"because, 'I just wanted to put a face to this celebration'.\\" In September 2008, Jessen was in Canberra, Australia, sponsored by the Australian Christian Lobby, to lobby federal politicians on late term abortions. The same month, Jessen appeared in a political advertisement during the 2008 US presidential campaign stating, \\"if Barack Obama had his way, I wouldn't be here\\", referring to Obama's opposition to \\"born alive\\" legislation. 2010s In September 2015, Jessen testified at a Congressional hearing investigating Planned Parenthood's practices regarding fetal tissue donation, following the Planned Parenthood 2015 undercover videos controversy. During her testimony, Jessen said she would ask Planned Parenthood the following question: \\"If abortion is about women’s rights, then what were mine?\\"  See also  * The Oldenburg Baby, a German child born after a failed abortion attempt  References  External links  * of Gianna Jessen *Gianna Jessen's page on The Abortion Survivors Network web site * Born Alive Truth political advertisement featuring Gianna Jessen critical of Barack Obama's position on Born Alive legislation * Gianna Jessen's address in Australia (YouTube) * Gianna Jessen's interview on the Maury Povich Show, 1991 *Gianna Jessen's testimony at Congressional Judiciary Committee hearing, September 9, 2015 Category:1977 births Category:American anti-abortion activists Category:Disability rights activists from the United States Category:Living people Category:People from Los Angeles Category:People with cerebral palsy Category:California Republicans Category:Tennessee Republicans Category:Activists from California Category:American adoptees ","title":"Gianna Jessen"},{"id":"1890964","title":"Great Offices of State"},{"id":"1890969","text":"Brain Bowl is an academic competition in which Florida Community College teams are pitted against one another. Teams consist of up to six players, only four of whom play at any given time. A moderator reads questions from four subject areas including humanities, mathematics, natural science and social sciences. Each area is equally represented. A buzzer system is used to identify the player who answers first. Ten points are awarded for correctly answering the tossup question. The team winning the tossup is eligible to win up to 30 points for correctly answering the follow-up bonus questions. After 24 questions, the team that has accumulated the most points wins the game. No questions about popular culture or media are used in Brain Bowl. Florida Brain Bowl Purpose The purpose of Brain Bowl competition is to recognize outstanding student academic achievement, to help focus community interest on academic excellence in Florida community colleges and to help foster relations among faculty and students as they work together on this joint project. History and Scholarships Florida Brain Bowl was created in the fall of 1981 and until 1991 was a joint project of the Florida State Department of Education and the Florida College System Activities Association (FCSAA). Since 1991, the FCSAA has been the sole sponsor of the Brain Bowl. After initially gaining the approval and support of the Florida Community College Council of Presidents, the fall of 1981 was spent developing rules and organizing regional competitions. The cash awards for the initial year came from a combination of funds from the legislative appropriation that established the Program to Recognize Initiative and Distinction in Education (PRIDE) and more than $12,000 that the founders of the Brain Bowl competition were able to raise from private sources. Since its inception in 1981, the Florida Community Colleges Brain Bowl competition has involved more than 1,000 students in regional and state competitions. During that time, the Florida Department of Education has awarded more than $80,000 to community college students who have competed in these tournaments. Private colleges and universities, as well as state supported universities, have made available almost $1 million worth of scholarship opportunities.

The stories are written by Peter Hogan, and drawn by Yanick Paquette and Karl Story with additional flashback sequences drawn by Eric Theriault. Each story is co-plotted by Alan Moore and Peter Hogan. It was published under Moore's America's Best Comics imprint through Wildstorm Comics, which is owned by DC Comics. Origin and backstory Terra Obscura first appeared in Tom Strong #11 (January 2001). Terra Obscura is an alternate version of Tom Strong's Earth located on the far side of the galaxy, discovered by Strong in 1968. On his visit to Terra Obscura, Tom meets his counterpart Tom \\"Doc\\" Strange, and the team of science-heroes known as the Society of Major American Science Heroes (SMASH). All the members of SMASH are based on characters previously published by Nedor Comics in the 1940s. With the original publisher's collapse, copyrights on the characters were not renewed upon 28 years of creation and so lapsed into the public domain. One of Nedor's many titles was America's Best Comics, and when the coincidence of this was pointed out to Alan Moore, he decided to incorporate these characters into his Tom Strong series. For their 2000 debut, Moore created a backstory for them, covering the time periods during which they were not actually being published. For the Terra Obscura spin-off, Moore worked out plots with Peter Hogan, who then wrote the scripts. Publishing history *Collections: ** Terra Obscura v1 ().

He played club rugby for London Welsh and then Saracens, before joining Cardiff Blues in 2003. The son of Jim Shanklin, who won four caps for Wales, Tom played for Wales at Under 19, Under 21 and Wales A levels and made his first international appearance for the senior side against Japan in Tokyo. Wales Shanklin made his debut in the Six Nations Championship against France in 2001; 32 years previously his father, Jim, had won his first international cap against the same opponents. At first Shanklin was regarded as a \\"super sub\\" in the Welsh side, but later established himself in the starting line-up. He produced some notable performances in the 2004 Autumn internationals, scoring eight tries in the four games. This included four tries against Romania and a spectacular try against New Zealand. He was sometimes played as a wing, but started all the 2005 Six Nations matches in his preferred position at centre. He was selected for the 2005 British and Irish Lions tour to New Zealand, but suffered a knee injury early in the tour which meant that he had to be replaced. As a result, he also missed the majority of the 2005–06 season. On 21 April 2009, Shanklin was named as a member of the British and Irish Lions for the 2009 tour to South Africa.BBC Sport : Lions Squad Announced But on 7 May it was announced that he would miss the tour because he required reconstructive surgery on his shoulder that would keep him out for 16 weeks. Shanklin won 70 caps for Wales (56 starts and 14 appearances as a substitute). He scored 20 tries, placing him 5th-equal (with Gerald Davies and Gareth Edwards) on the list of record try-scorers for Wales. Following a fourth knee operation in February 2011, on 21 April Shanklin announced his immediate retirement from all forms of the game.

Walker is Emeritus Director and Professor at the MRC Mitochondrial Biology Unit in Cambridge, and a Fellow of Sidney Sussex College, Cambridge.John Walker interviewed by Alan Macfarlane 14 January 2008 (film)Freeview Video of Fredrick Sanger in conversation with John Walker by the Vega Science TrustA three part video interview with Sir John Walker by the Vega Science Trust Early life and education Walker was born in Halifax, Yorkshire, the son of Thomas Ernest Walker, a stonemason, and Elsie Lawton, an amateur musician. He was brought up with his two younger sisters (Judith and Gen) in a rural environment and went to Rastrick Grammar School. At school, he was a keen sportsman and specialized in physical sciences and mathematics during his final three years there. He received a Bachelor of Arts degree in Chemistry from St Catherine's College, Oxford. Walker began his study of peptide antibiotics with Edward Abraham at Oxford in 1965 and received his Doctor of Philosophy degree in 1969. During this period, he became interested in developments in molecular biology. Career and research From 1969 to 1971, Walker worked at the University of Wisconsin–Madison, and from 1971-1974 in France. He met Fred Sanger in 1974 at a workshop at the University of Cambridge. This resulted in an invitation to work at the Laboratory of Molecular Biology of the Medical Research Council, which became a long-term appointment. Among the other staff was Francis Crick, who was well known for his discovery of the molecular structure of DNA. At first, he analyzed the sequences of proteins and then uncovered details of the modified genetic code in mitochondria. In 1978, he decided to apply protein chemical methods to membrane proteins. In this way, Walker characterized the subunit composition of proteins in the mitochondrial membrane and the DNA sequence of the mitochondrial genome. His landmark crystallographic studies of the F1-ATPase, the catalytic region of the ATP synthase (done in collaboration with crystallographer Andrew Leslie), from bovine heart mitochondria revealed the three catalytic sites in three different conformations imposed by the position of the asymmetric central stalk. This structure supported the binding change mechanism and rotary catalysis for the ATP synthase (and related enzymes), one of the catalytic mechanisms proposed by Paul Boyer. This work, published in 1994, led to Walker's share of the 1997 Nobel prize for chemistry. Since this structure, Walker and his colleagues have produced most of the crystal structures in the PDB of mitochondrial ATP synthase, including transition state structures and protein with bound inhibitors and antibiotics. Scientists trained in Walker's group at the MRC Laboratory of Molecular Biology in Cambridge or MRC Mitochondrial Biology Unit have gone on to determine crystal bacterial complex I and cryo-EM maps of mitochondrial complex I and vacuolar type ATPases.

The name of the genre was coined by Sounds journalist Garry Bushell, who actively championed many of its exponents. Punk pathetique was initially an attempt to characterize a group of London bands that embodied Cockney culture with a Dickensian working class attitude. Musically, it was related to (and had crossover with) the Oi! subgenre. The cover of the 1980 Bushell/Sounds compilation album Oi the Album described the record as featuring \\"ruck 'n' rollers and punk pathetiques\\". In contrast to harder-edged Oi! bands with more serious lyrics, punk pathetique bands focused on the naughty, silly and trivial. Max Splodge of Splodgenessabounds said: \\"The pathetique bands are the other side of Oi! We're working class too, only whereas some bands sing about prison and the dole, we sing about pilchards and bums. The audience is the same\\". Some punk pathetique bands had notable success in the UK charts. Toy Dolls reached No. 4 in December 1984 with \\"Nellie the Elephant\\". Splodgenessabounds reached No. 7 in 1980 with \\"Simon Templar,\\" and No. 26 with \\"Two Little Boys\\" later that year. According to Bushell: Peter and the Test Tube Babies were first featured in Sounds in July 1980, and made their vinyl debut on Oi! the Album later that year. They favoured absurd lyrics and strange titles, such as \\"The Queen Gives Good Blow Jobs\\" and \\"Elvis Is Dead (He Was 42 and a Fat Cunt)\\". Toy Dolls, based in Sunderland, shared the punk pathetique approach to nonsensical entertainment. Toy Dolls singer Michael \\"Olga\\" Algar told Sounds in March 1980: \\"We're a new wave group, but we're not serious. All our songs are pretty childish and infantile, but they're all based on things and people 'round here\\". Bushell wrote that punk pathetique peaked in autumn 1980, with the \\"Pathetique Convention\\" staged at the Electric Ballroom. However, music critic Dave Thompson has said, regarding Splodgenessabounds' 1981 album: Other punk pathetique bands included Television Personalities, Half Man Half Biscuit, the Shapes, the Gonads, the Adicts, Notsensibles, the Postmen, Desert Island Joe, the Hoopers, Pierre the Poet (Garry Butterfield), Paul Devine, Lord Waistrel & the Cosh Boys, Stephen Louis Knoche Jr & His Raging Cronies, the Alaska Cowboys, Percy Throwers Man Eating Plans, SexyCows, and the Orgasm Guerrillas. Later, the mantle was inherited by the Bus Station Loonies, Monkish and Macc Lads, who performed comic punk singalongs in very much the same style. Toy Dolls, Peter and the Test Tube Babies, the Gonads, and Splodgenessabounds continue to tour and record. In Germany, the similar Fun-Punk genre emerged in the mid-1980s as a response to hardcore punk, which at that time was marked by political correctness and negative imagery.Punk Rock BRD 1, Begleitheft Fun-Punk often dealt with absurd themes or alcohol and drug excesses.

The company merged with EKCO in 1960. Philips of the Netherlands acquired a majority shareholding in 1967, and later gained full ownership.  Early growth  W. G. Pye & Co. Ltd was founded in 1896 in Cambridge by William Pye, superintendent of the Cavendish Laboratory workshop, as a part-time business making scientific instruments. By the outbreak of World War I in 1914, the company employed 40 people manufacturing instruments used for teaching and research. The war increased demand for such instruments and the War Office needed experimental thermionic valves. The manufacture of such components afforded the company the technical knowledge needed to develop the first wireless receiver when the first UK broadcasts were made by the British Broadcasting Company in 1922. Instruments continued to be designed and manufactured under W G Pye Ltd, later situated in York Street Cambridge, while a separate company was started to build wireless components in a factory to become known as Cambridge Works at Church Path, Chesterton. A series of receivers made at Church Path were given positive reviews by Popular Wireless magazine. In 1924, Harold Pye, the son of the founder, and Edward Appleton, his former tutor at St John's College, Cambridge, designed a new series of receivers which proved even more saleable. In 1928 William Pye sold the company, now renamed Pye Radio Limited, to C. O. Stanley, who established a chain of small component-manufacturing factories across East Anglia. When the BBC started to explore television broadcasting, Pye found that the closest of their East Anglian offices was 25 miles outside the estimated effective 25-mile radius of the Alexandra Palace transmitter. Stanley was fascinated by the new technology and on his instructions the company built a high gain receiver that could pick up these transmissions. In 1937, a five-inch Pye television receiver was priced at 21 guineas (£22.05) and within two years the company had sold 2,000 sets at an average price of £34 (). The new EF50 valve from Philips enabled Pye to build this high-gain receiver, which was a Tuned Radio Frequency (TRF) type and not a superhet type. With the outbreak of World War II, the Pye receiver using EF50 valves became a key component of many radar receivers, forming the 45 MHz Intermediate Amplifier (IF) section of the equipment. Pye went on to design and manufacture radio equipment for the British Army, including Wireless Sets No. 10, 18, 19, 22, 62 and 68. Pye was also responsible for the early development work on the proximity fuze for anti-aircraft shells. Demo of television in Mons (Belgium) on 16 September 1947 In February 1944, Pye formed a subsidiary called Pye Telecommunications Ltd, which it intended would design and produce radio communications equipment when the war ended. This company grew to become the leading UK producer of mobile radio equipment for commercial, business, industrial, police and government purposes. Popular products included the Reporter, Cambridge, and Westminster series of VHF radio transceivers. The company also produced the PF8 UHF hand-held radios featured in episodes of The Professionals television series. After the war, Pye's B16T nine-inch table television was designed around the 12-year-old EF50 valve. It was soon superseded by the B18T, which used an extra high tension (EHT) transformer developed by German companies before the war to produce the high voltage required by the cathode ray tube. In 1955, the company diversified into music production with Pye Records. The Independent Television Authority (ITA) started public transmissions in the same year, so Pye produced new televisions that could receive ITV, and the availability of a second channel introduced the need for tuners. Pye's VT4 tunable television was launched in March 1954 and was followed by the V14. The V14 proved to be technically unreliable and so tarnished the Pye name that many dealers transferred their allegiance to other manufacturers. This failure so damaged corporate confidence that Pye avoided being first-to-market thereafter, although they developed the first British transistor in 1956. Pye television camera and monitor Pye TVT Ltd was formed to produce broadcast television equipment, including cameras, which were popular with British broadcasters including the BBC as well as achieving international sales. The early cameras were called \\"Photicon\\" and the later models by their Mk number: 2, 3, etc. The Mk7/8 solid-state monochrome cameras were the last to be produced. The Pye Mk6 image orthicon camera, known as the PC60, was the last version supplied to BBC Outside Broadcasts in 1963 for a new fleet of eight outside broadcast vans. These cameras were the first generation of outside broadcast cameras to feature a zoom lens, rather than a turret system. These three-tubed cameras were known for their reliability but were so heavy and unwieldy that they required a stretcher to carry them around the OB site. The Pye PC60 was eventually replaced by the EMI 2001 on BBC outside broadcasts but, during its lifespan, it was used on numerous high-profile productions including Wimbledon tennis and Open golf. The ITV companies purchased the popular Pye Mk3s, and to a lesser extent the Mk4s and Mk7s. Pye (TVT) never produced a colour broadcast television camera, but there was an abortive colour telecine camera; few if any were sold. The reason for this was probably the financial difficulties the company was in. In 1960, Pye acquired the Telephone Manufacturing Company. Company trouble and sell-off Not wishing to risk further damage to their fragile brand, Pye first used transistors in a product sold as a subsidiary brand: the Pam 710 radio (1956), with the transistors themselves labelled Newmarket Transistors (another subsidiary). When this proved acceptable the company launched the Pye 123 radio (1957, still with the Newmarket label on the novel internal components). Products such as these reversed the decline but the arrival of Japanese competition reduced demand to a level that threatened the viability of the manufacturing plants. In 1960, Pye merged with its rival EKCO to form British Electronic Industries Ltd, with C. O. Stanley as Chairman and E. K. Cole as Vice-Chairman. The company, like most of its domestic competitors, attempted to restore demand with price competition and, where viable production exceeded demand, sold excess stock at loss-making clearance prices. By 1966 Pye was in such difficulties that they started to reduce their manufacturing capacity with closure of the EKCO factory in Southend-on-Sea. Philips attempted to buy out the ailing Pye in 1966. The Trade Secretary Anthony Wedgwood Benn determined that a complete sale would create a de facto monopoly so he permitted the transfer of only a 60% shareholding, with an undertaking that the Lowestoft factory would continue to manufacture televisions. On 20 April 1964, BBC2 was launched, broadcasting entirely on the new television standard of 625-line UHF, but BBC1 and ITV would remain in 405-line VHF until 1969, when they began UHF broadcasting. During this transition, television receivers in the UK had to handle both the VHF and UHF wavebands, which added to the cost of producing the sets. The price of a dual-standard set, combined with the limited coverage of BBC2 and the highbrow programming on that channel, meant that initial sales of dual- standard sets were slow. The VHF system was finally switched off in the UK on 3 January 1985. PAL colour test signals began in 1966 and scheduled transmissions commenced on BBC2 on 1 July 1967, with a full colour service beginning on that channel on 2 December 1967. BBC1 and ITV followed suit on 15 November 1969. Colour broadcasting added further to the cost and complexity of producing television sets. The resulting high price and low coverage areas of the new technology delayed consumer adoption further: it wasn't until 1977 that the number of colour licences sold outnumbered those of black and white. In the early 1970s, Sony and Hitachi launched UK colour televisions that cost less than £200. Domestic manufacturers attempted to compete, but were handicapped by outdated manufacturing techniques and an inflexible workforce. Pye found themselves with high stocks and low cash flow at a time when industrial relations were poor, the low-growth economy of the time and limited scope for reducing costs. The Pye group of companies was bought outright by Philips in 1976. The Lowestoft factory was subsequently sold to Sanyo and Philips moved the manufacture of Pye televisions to Singapore. Prior to the manufacturing offshoring, the company produced a range of televisions branded 'Pye Chelsea'. The range were teak-clad with stainless steel 'feet' and sported three large channel selectors. Whilst unsuitable for the reception of the forthcoming Channel 4, the equipment would operate through early video recorders, machines with larger channel capability. The Chelsea range were popular with TV rental companies such as Radio Rentals, Rumbelows and Wigfalls. Maintenance of these sets continued well into the 1980s, with the northern rental chain Wigfalls being the last to withdraw them in 1988. In 1979 Pye were implicated in an episode of Granada's World in Action in relation to the sale of UHF and VHF radios as well as telephone intercept equipment which was used by the Ugandan Public Safety Unit, the secret police of Idi Amin's rule responsible for killing perhaps several hundred thousand Ugandans.World in Action: Inside Idi Amin's Terror Machine, first broadcast 13 June 1979 Pye had been supplying Uganda through Wilken Telecommunications, its East Africa distributor. The Pye brand enjoyed a short-lived renaissance in audio equipment (known as music centres) during the 1970s, and in the late 1980s with televisions, gaining something of a cult status among college students at the time. In recent years the Pye brand has enjoyed a resurgence on the UK market , with domestic products including DVD recorders. The Pye brand is one of a handful surviving today from the early domestic electronics era that dates to before World War II.

Stevens was born in Brussels. He came from a family involved with the visual arts: his older brother Joseph (1816–1892) and his son Léopold (1866–1935) were painters, while another brother Arthur (1825–1899) was an art dealer and critic. His father, who had fought in the Napoleonic wars in the army of William I of the Netherlands, was an art collector who owned several watercolors by Eugène Delacroix, among other artists. His mother's parents ran Café de l'Amitié in Brussels, a meeting place for politicians, writers, and artists. All the Stevens children benefited from the people they met there, and the social skills they acquired in growing up around important people. Education After the death of his father in 1837, Stevens left middle school to begin study at the Académie Royale des Beaux-Arts in Brussels, where he knew François Navez, the Neo-Classical painter and former student of Jacques-Louis David who was its director and an old friend of Stevens's grandfather. Following a traditional curriculum, he drew from casts of classical sculpture for the first two years, and then drew from live models. In 1843, Stevens went to Paris, joining his brother Joseph who already was there. He was admitted to the École des Beaux-Arts, the most important art school in Paris. Although it is said that he became a student of its director Jean Auguste Dominique Ingres, this is likely not true. An early picture by Stevens, The Pardon or Absolution (Hermitage, St. Petersburg), signed and dated 1849, shows his mastery of a conventional naturalistic style which owes much to 17th-century Dutch genre painting. Like the Belgian painter and friend with whom he stayed in Paris, Florent Joseph Marie Willems (1823–1905), Stevens carefully studied works by painters such as Gerard ter Borch and Gabriel Metsu.Thomas, Bernadette. \\"Alfred (Emile-Léopold) Stevens\\" in Oxford Art Online. Retrieved 27 December 2013. Career beginnings Stevens's work was shown publicly for the first time in 1851, when three of his paintings were admitted to the Brussels Salon. He was awarded a third-class medal at the Paris Salon in 1853, and a second-class medal at the Universal Exposition in Paris in 1855. His Ce qu'on appelle le vagabondage [What is called vagrancy] (Musée d'Orsay, Paris) attracted the attention of Napoleon III who, as a result of the scene in the picture, ordered that soldiers no longer be used to pick up the poor from the streets. Two other paintings he exhibited at the Salon in Antwerp that year, Chez soi or At Home (present location unknown) and The Painter and his Model (Walters Art Museum, Baltimore), introduced subjects from \\"la vie moderne\\" for which he became known: an elegant young woman in contemporary dress and the artist in his studio. In 1857, Stevens made his first important sale to a private collector, when Consolation was bought for a rumored 6,000 francs by the Berlin collector and dealer Ravéné. At the same time, he and his brother were becoming part of the art world of Paris, meeting people such as the Goncourt brothers, Théophile Gautier, and Alexandre Dumas at the salons of Princess Mathilde as well as popular cafés. In 1858, Stevens married Marie Blanc, who came from a rich Belgian family and old friends of the Stevens's. Eugène Delacroix was a witness at the ceremony. Mature career Elegant Figures in a Salon Le Bain The Psyché (My Studio), ca. 1871, Princeton University Art Museum During the 1860s, Stevens became an immensely successful painter, known for his paintings of elegant modern women. His exhibits at the Salons in Paris and Brussels attracted favorable critical attention and buyers. An excellent example of his work during this time is La Dame en Rose or Woman in Pink (Royal Museums of Fine Arts of Belgium, Brussels), painted in 1866, which combines a view of a fashionably dressed woman in an interior with a detailed examination of Japanese objects, a fashionable taste called japonisme of which Stevens was an early enthusiast. In 1863, he received the Legion of Honor (Chevalier) from the French government. In 1867, he won a first-class medal at the Universal Exposition in Paris, where he and Jan August Hendrik Leys were the stars of the Belgian section, and was promoted to Officer of the Legion of Honor. His friends included Édouard Manet, Edgar Degas, Charles Baudelaire, Berthe Morisot, James Abbott McNeill Whistler, Frédéric Bazille, and Puvis de Chavannes, and he was a regular in the group that gathered at the Café Guerbois in Paris. Stevens fought for the French during the siege of Paris in the Franco-Prussian War, but returned to Belgium with his wife and family before the Paris Commune. They returned after the war, and Stevens continued to achieve critical acclaim as well as great success with collectors. In 1875, he bought a grand house and garden in Paris on rue des Martyrs, which appeared in his paintings as well as those of other artists, including Édouard Manet's The Croquet Party (Städel Museum, Frankfurt am Main) from 1873. (He had to leave the house in 1880, however, to make way for the construction of a new street, which was named after him.) In 1878, he was made a Commander of the Legion of Honor and received another first-class medal at the Salon. Despite earning a considerable income through the sale of his paintings, Stevens found that a combination of bad investments and excessive spending caused him great financial difficulties during the 1880s. An additional expense came from summers by the sea, which a doctor told Stevens in 1880 were essential for his health. Thus the artist was glad to agree when the Paris dealer Georges Petit offered him 50,000 francs to finance his vacation in exchange for the paintings Stevens produced during that time. This deal, which lasted for three years, resulted in the sea becoming an important subject for him, and over the rest of his career, he painted hundreds of views of popular resorts along the Normandy coast and the Midi in the south. Many of them are painted in a sketchy style that shows the influence of the Impressionists. Stevens also began to take private students, including Sarah Bernhardt, who became a close personal friend, and William Merritt Chase. Other students were Berthe Art, Charles Bell Birch, Jules Cayron, Marie Collart-Henrotin, Louise De Hem, Harriet Campbell Foss, Georgette Meunier, Lilla Cabot Perry, Jean-Paul Sinibaldi, and Fernand Toussaint.Alfred Stevens in the RKD Late career The single most important work from the second half of Stevens's career is the monumental Panorama du Siècle, 1789–1889, which he painted with Henri Gervex. Stevens painted the women and details and Gervex the men, with the help of fifteen assistants. It was shown to great acclaim at the International Exhibition held in Paris in 1889. He also received several great professional tributes. In 1895, a large exhibition of his work was held in Brussels. In 1900, Stevens was honored by the Ecole des Beaux-Arts in Paris with the first retrospective exhibition ever given to a living artist. Supported by patrons led by the Comtesse de Greffulhe, it achieved social cachet as well as popular success. In 1905, he was the only living artist allowed to exhibit in a retrospective show of Belgian art in Brussels. Despite these exhibitions, he was not able to sell enough of his work to manage well financially. Having outlived his brothers and most of his friends, he died in Paris in 1906, living alone in modest rooms.

He is the only head of government to plead guilty to genocide, in the first group of such convictions since the Convention on the Prevention and Punishment of the Crime of Genocide came into effect in 1951. Kambanda holds a degree in commercial engineering and began his career as a low-level United Popular BPR banker, rising as a technocrat to become the chair of the bank. At the time of the April 1994 crisis he was vice president of the Butare section of the opposition Republican Democratic Movement (MDR). He was sworn in as prime minister on April 9, 1994 after the president Juvénal Habyarimana and prime minister Agathe Uwilingiyimana, were both assassinated. The opposition MDR had been promised the prime ministerial post in the transitional government established by the Arusha accords, but Kambanda leapfrogged several levels in the party's hierarchy to take the job from the initial choice, Faustin Twagiramungu. He remained in the post for the hundred days of the genocide until July 19, 1994. After leaving office he fled the country. Criminal responsibility Kambanda was arrested in Nairobi on July 18, 1997, after a seven-week multinational stakeout and transferred to the International Criminal Tribunal for Rwanda. The court accused him of distributing small arms and ammunition in Butare and Gitarama with the knowledge that they would be used to massacre civilians. He was found guilty after pleading guilty, a plea he later rescinded, but which rescission the Court did not accept. On September 4, 1998, the ICTR condemned Jean Kambanda to life imprisonment for: *Genocide, and Agreement to commit genocide *Incitement to genocide *Aiding and abetting genocide *Failing in his duty to prevent the genocide which occurred while he was prime minister *Two counts of crimes against humanity Joy Mukanyange, the Rwandan Ambassador to Tanzania was the only Rwandan official who attended the sentencing. She thought it fair that Kambanda received a life sentence and his crimes had been recognized by the international community. She noted that Rwanda was \\"not looking for revenge\\". This verdict was upheld by the ICTR Appeal Chamber on October 19, 2000, and Kambanda is currently jailed in Koulikoro Prison in Mali.  Blaming the army  Although Kambanda pleaded guilty after receiving legal counsel, his lawyer argued that the prime minister was a \\"puppet\\" of the military, who had dragged him from his bank, after killing the previous prime minister, to legitimize their control of their country. He asked the ICTR for a sentence of two years because he acted \\"under duress with limited responsibility\\". The court concluded that this defense against a charge of genocide was irrelevant. In 2006 he testified for the defence of Colonel Theoneste Bagosora in the 'Military 1' trial of senior military leaders. That testimony was the former Prime Minister's first and only public testimony on the 1994 events in Rwanda and in which he said that he had never found a plan to commit genocide. The decisions of the ICTR regarding Kambanda have been subject to criticism.  Responsible but not guilty  In his appeal, Kambanda said that his confession had been in error, due to poor or misunderstood counsel. He said that his objective was not to plead guilty but to tell the truth. According to the ICTR appeal: : \\"Kambanda noted that while he felt politically responsible for what happened, he did not feel guilty at the time and does not feel guilty now.\\"  Legal legacy  As a head of government convicted by an international court, Kambanda is an important figure, with the verdict against him forming a precedent against the legal principle of State Immunity (which was used to reject an extradition order for Augusto Pinochet, for example).House of Lords Should Stand on \\"Right Side of History,\\" says Rights Group - Human Rights Watch on the implications of the Kambanda conviction to Pinochet case (from 1998).

Although admitted crimes of action and inaction are cited, the commentary notes that Kambanda and Jean-Paul Akayesu (his fellow accused) were \\"Pillars of their communities\\".

The principal charge against the workings of the International Criminal Tribunal for Rwanda is that Kambanda's right to counsel was overridden. ::Although he was able to select his own choice of lawyer from a screened list, the court's Registrar held the final say. Not only was his attorney chosen by the court that was prosecuting him, the registrar is officially required to select a counsel 'prudently' with regard to their cost, and French and Canadian lawyers were initially excluded from the list (despite these countries supplying the majority of qualified French speakers who have passed the ICTR bar). ::Kambanda's decision to defend himself for four months was scarcely recorded in the court's proceedings, and when he opted for counsel, the first act of the counsellor (who is characterized as 'inept') was to sign a confession to the prosecution's case. This analysis concludes that the appeal was strategically flawed, and that the probable reason for the legal \\"carelessness\\" was that Kambanda was the face of genocide in Kigali; no more time could be wasted before he was given the court's most severe punishment, without recourse to appeal. ::Ultimately, the critique is not on the grounds of justice (Kambanda was certainly guilty), but concern that the court ultimately produced a show trial, since his appeal may not have been thrown out by the U.S. courts. * The International War Crimes Tribunal for Rwanda (ICTR) pressroom report on the Kambanda appeal - in which, among other things, the reasoning of incompetent representation and the credibility of a mistaken confession are rejected.

Myrick (May 28, 1832 – August 18, 1862), was a trader who, with his Dakota wife (Winyangewin/Nancy Myrick), operated stores in southwest Minnesota at two Indian agencies serving the Dakota (referred to as Sioux at the time) near the Minnesota River. In the summer of 1862, when the Dakota were starving because of failed crops and delayed annuity payments, Myrick is noted as refusing to sell them food on credit, allegedly saying, \\"Let them eat grass,\\" although the validity of that alleged quotation has come into dispute. Background In the summer of 1862, eastern bands of the Dakota people were living in a small reservation along the southern bank of the Minnesota River. Their crops had failed and the area had been overhunted, and they were starving. In a meeting at the Upper Sioux Agency on August 4, US Indian Agent Thomas Galbraith directed that only some food be released to the Dakota from the warehouse, as annuity supplies and payments had been delayed by the American Civil War and a government preoccupied with the Northern Virginia Campaign, which threatened the safety of the capital, Washington D.C. Andrew Myrick had stores at both Yellow Medicine (also known as the Upper Sioux Agency) and Redwood (Lower Sioux Agency). After Galbraith decided against issuing more of the annuity food, he turned to the store owners and workers and asked them what they were intending to do. Myrick had been told that the \\"traders paper\\", which allowed the traders to be paid directly from the annuity allotments for what they were owed on credit by Native Americans, was not going to be allowed this time. Death On August 18, 1862 Chief Little Crow led his warriors against U.S. settlements, beginning the Dakota War. Myrick was killed on the first day at the Battle of Lower Sioux Agency, where Dakota warriors took revenge at the agency for its failure to give them food.

It was the site of the Battle of Lower Sioux Agency on August 18, 1862, the first organized battle of the Dakota War of 1862. Today it is a historic site managed by the Lower Sioux Community in partnership with the Minnesota Historical Society. The site contains an interpretive center, self-guided trails, and a restored 1861 stone warehouse which is listed on the National Register of Historic Places. History The Lower Sioux Agency was established in 1853 by the United States government, to oversee the newly created Lower Sioux Indian Reservation. This reservation was to be the home for the Mdewakanton and Wahpekute bands following the 1851 Treaty of Mendota. On August 15, 1862, the Lower Sioux turned to the Agency staff for supplies. Representatives of the northern Sissetowan and Wahpeton Dakota bands had successfully negotiated to obtain food at the Upper Sioux Agency on August 4. However Thomas J. Galbraith, the Indian agent in charge, rejected the Lower Sioux bands as he would not distribute food to these bands without payment. At a meeting of the Dakota, the U.S. government and local traders, the Dakota representatives asked the representative of the government traders, Andrew J. Myrick, to sell them food on credit. His response was said to be, \\"So far as I am concerned, if they are hungry let them eat grass or their own dung.\\" On August 16, 1862, the treaty payments to the Dakota arrived in St. Paul, Minnesota, and were brought to Fort Ridgely the next day. They arrived too late to prevent violence. On August 17, 1862, four young Dakota men were on a hunting trip in Acton Township, Minnesota, during which one stole eggs and then killed five white settlers. Soon after, a Dakota war council was convened and their leader, Little Crow, agreed to continue attacks on the European-American settlements to try to drive out the whites. On August 18, 1862, Little Crow led a group that attacked the Lower Sioux Agency. Andrew Myrick was discovered trying to escape through a second-floor window of a building at the agency. Myrick's body later was found with grass stuffed into his mouth because of his recent statement (See above). The warriors burned the buildings at the Lower Sioux Agency, giving enough time for settlers to escape across the river at Redwood Ferry. Minnesota militia forces and B Company of the 5th Minnesota Volunteer Infantry Regiment sent to quell the uprising were defeated at the Battle of Redwood Ferry. Twenty-four soldiers, including the party's commander (Captain John Marsh), were killed in the battle. Throughout the day, Dakota war parties swept the Minnesota River Valley and near vicinity, killing many settlers. Numerous settlements including the Townships of Milford, Leavenworth and Sacred Heart, were surrounded and burned and their populations nearly exterminated. Current use The Lower Sioux Agency Interpretive Center Self-guided trails take visitors around the site. The 1861 granary is the only surviving structure from the agency. Interpretive signs mark the locations of other features, including the location of the Redwood Ferry crossing the Minnesota River.

His major work is the monument to the Duke of Wellington in St Paul's Cathedral. Early life Alfred Stevens was born on 30 December 1817 at Blandford Forum in Dorset, the son of a decorator and joiner. At the age of ten, he entered his father's workshop as an assistant. In 1833, the rector of his parish enabled him to go to Italy, where he spent nine years studying at Naples, Bologna, Siena, Pompeii, Capri, Rome, Milan, Venice, and Florence where he studied for a time at the Accademia di Belle Arti. Stevens had never attended an English school. In 1841, Bertel Thorvaldsen employed him for a year in Rome. After a significant period of study and training throughout Italy, Stevens returned to England. Career In 1845, Stevens obtained a tutorial position in the School of Design at Somerset House, London, where he remained until 1847. In 1850 he became chief artist to the Sheffield firm of H.E. Hoole and Co. who specialised in bronze and metal work. While in Sheffield it is thought that Stevens devised plans which were eventually integrated into the design of the ornate gateway of the Green Lane Works of 1860.A Popular History Of Sheffield, J. Edward Vickers, , Page 204 Gives details of Alfred Stevens work in Sheffield. Sheffield Hallam University - Public Art in Sheffield. Gives details of Stevens‘ work on Green Lane Works. In 1852 he returned to London. To this period belongs his design for the vases on the railings in front of the British Museum, and also the lions on the dwarf posts which were subsequently transferred to the inside of the museum. This cites: * Sir William Armstrong, Alfred Stevens (London, 1881) * H. Stannus, Alfred Stevens (London, 1891). Plaster and wax model for the Wellington Monument, 1857. Victoria and Albert Museum, London In 1856, Stevens took part in the competition for the Wellington monument, originally intended to be set up under one of the great arches of St Paul's Cathedral, though it was only consigned to that position in 1892. Stevens agreed to carry out the monument for £20,000 – a quite derisory sum, as it turned out. Stevens devoted most of his career to this grand monument, constantly harassed and finally worn out by the interference of government, want of money and other difficulties. Stevens did not live to see the monument set up. For many years it was placed in a small side chapel, where the effect was utterly destroyed and its magnificent bronze groups hidden from view. Stevens was aware of the position finally decided on for the work, and he suppressed the equestrian group intended for the summit and left the model for the latter feature in a rough state. On the removal of the monument from the chapel to the inter- columnar space on the north side of the nave for which it was originally designed, the model of horse and man was placed in the hands of another sculptor, to be worked upon and cast in bronze. It was still not completed by 1920, after years of work and polemics, and it was feared that it would have a disastrous result on the masterpiece as a whole. The president of the Royal Institute of British Architects declared that the structure would not bear the weight of the addition. The monument consists of a sarcophagus supporting a recumbent bronze effigy of the duke, over which is an arched marble canopy of late Renaissance style on delicately enriched shafts. At each end of the upper part of the canopy is a large bronze group, one representing \\"Truth tearing the tongue out of the mouth of False-hood\\", and the other \\"Valour trampling Cowardice underfoot\\". The two virtues are represented by very stately female figures modelled with wonderful beauty and vigour; the vices are two nude male figures treated in a very massive way. The vigorous strength of these groups recalls the style of Michelangelo, but Stevens's work throughout is original and has a very distinct character of its own. Model for \\"Valour and Cowardice\\", 1857-1866. Victoria and Albert Museum, London Owing to the many years he spent on this one work Stevens produced little other sculpture. In Dorchester House (demolished in 1929 to make way for the hotel of the same name), Park Lane, there was some of his work, most notably a mantelpiece supported by nude female caryatids in a crouching attitude, modelled with great largeness of style, now in the central refreshment room at the Victoria and Albert museum. He also designed the four mosaics of the prophets Isaiah, Jeremiah, Ezekiel and Daniel, which fill the spandrels under the dome of St Paul's Cathedral. One of his pupils was Edgar Bundy. Personal life and death Stevens resided at 7 Canning Place in Kensington, London. He died suddenly in his studio in London, aged 57. The cause of his death is unspecified. He is buried in the western part of Highgate Cemetery in North London. References * Sir Walter Armstrong, Alfred Stevens (London, 1881); Hugh Stannus, Alfred Stevens (London, 1891).

The elder Gretzky, an avid hockey player as a youth and a keen analyst of the game, is credited by his famous son as playing a key role in his phenomenal success as a player. Walter coached his hockey-loving son continuously, starting at age three, building him a backyard rink, devising creative exercises and drills, teaching him profound insights into how to play successfully, and accompanying him to most of his games.Wayne Gretzky Profile www.famoussportspeople.com/wayne- gretzky He is famous for instructing Wayne and his brothers to “Go to where the puck is going, not where it has been.\\" The elder Gretzky is well known in his own right for his contributions to minor hockey in Canada, and for his dedication to helping many local, provincial, and national charities, for which he has been honoured and recognized. Early life The Gretzky family were landowners in the Russian Empire, and supporters of Tsar Nicholas II originally from Grodno/Hrodna (now in the Republic of Belarus). Prior to the outbreak of the Russian Revolution, Gretzky's father Anton (\\"Tony\\") Gretzky (; pronounced Hretskyy), a white émigré, immigrated along with his family to Canada via the United States from Ukraine. Following World War I, Anton, who served in the Canadian Expeditionary Force, would marry his wife, Mary, who immigrated from Podhajce, interwar Poland (now Ukraine). Gretzky's ancestry is typically described as either Belarusian, Ukrainian, or Polish. In interviews, Walter Gretzky has stated that his parents were \\"White Russians from Belarus\\", and whenever anyone asked his father if they were Russian, he would reply, \\"Nyet. Belarus.\\" On other occasions he has mentioned his family's Polish ancestry. According to one source \\"the only Slavic language spoken in the Gretzky family [was] Polish,\\" of which Walter was a fluent speaker from childhood,http://www.waltergretzky.com/index.php?page=biography Tony and Mary owned a cucumber farm in Canning, Ontario where Walter Gretzky was born and raised. This is where he met his future wife, Phyllis Hockin at a wiener roast when she was 15 and he was 18. She was a descendant of British General Sir Isaac Brock, a hero of the War of 1812. They married in 1960, and moved to Brantford, Ontario, where Gretzky worked for Bell Telephone Canada. The family moved into a house on Varadi Avenue in Brantford seven months after the birth of their son, Wayne Gretzky, chosen partly because the yard was flat enough to be able to make an ice rink every winter. The couple would later have a daughter, Kim (b. 1963), and three more sons, Keith, Glen (b. 1969), and Brent. Unlike Walter, who did Sharp ViewCam commercials with Wayne and Wayne's son, Ty, Phyllis Gretzky mostly refused to embrace the celebrity that sprang from their son's exploits, although she did a commercial with Wayne for ProStars Cereal in the 1980s and appeared in the video Wayne Gretzky: Above and Beyond (1990). Background in sport Walter was an excellent athlete in high school. He excelled in track, setting school records in running, pole vault, and long jump. However, he was even better at hockey, and in his teens was a prolific goal-scorer during five years of play with the Junior B-level Woodstock Warriors. He set his sights on the National Hockey League (NHL), and some thought he was destined to make it there. A local car salesman, in order to encourage the rising hockey star, bestowed a new car on him for a nominal charge, so that he could more easily drive to hockey games in and around Woodstock, but his size and weight, at 5-foot-9 inches and 140 lbs, was a problem. He tried out for a major team at the Junior A level, but unfortunately, just a few weeks beforehand, came down with chicken pox, losing considerable weight. Although he scored just as many goals in the tryout game as any of his fellow hopefuls, he was judged to be too small for the higher league. He returned to play with the Woodstock team. Career Walter was an installer and repairman for Bell Canada for 34 years, retiring in 1991. A work-related injury he suffered in 1961 left him in a coma and resulted in deafness in his right ear. Five days after his 53rd birthday, in 1991, he suffered a near-fatal brain aneurysm which destroyed his short-term memory. His physical therapist, Ian Kohler, married his daughter Kim in 1995. His ordeal is the basis of the CBC movie Waking Up Wally: The Walter Gretzky Story. He spends his time helping charities and fundraisers and coaching at his summer youth hockey camp in California. In his book Walter recounts that during his recovery from his brain aneurysm, the only language he could speak was Ukrainian. Coaching Some said that his son Wayne, lauded by most sportswriters and the NHL itself as the greatest hockey player who ever lived, had God-given abilities, but Wayne gave a great deal of credit to his father's brilliant coaching. The elder Gretzky devised numerous creative ways to develop hockey skills. Walter's drills were his own invention, but were ahead of their time in Canada. Gretzky would later remark that the Soviet National Team's practice drills, which impressed Canada in 1972, had nothing to offer him: \\"I'd been doing those drills since I was three. My Dad was very smart.\\" > Some say I have a 'sixth sense' . . . Baloney, I've just learned to guess > what's going to happen next. Its anticipation. It's not God-given, it's > Wally-given. He used to stand on the blue line and say to me, 'Watch, this > is how everybody else does it.' Then he'd shoot a puck along the boards and > into the corner and then go chasing after it. Then he'd come back and say, > 'Now, this is how the smart player does it.' He'd shoot it into the corner > again, only this time he cut across to the other side and picked it up over > there. Who says anticipation can't be taught? In his autobiography, Wayne describes how his Dad would teach him the fundamentals of smart hockey, quiz style: > Him: \\"Where do you skate?\\" Me: \\"To where the puck is going, not where it's > been.\\" Him: \\"Where's the last place a guy looks before he passes it?\\" Me: > \\"The guy he's passing to.\\" Him: \\"Which means...\\" Me: \\"Get over there and > intercept it.\\" Him: \\"If you get cut off, what are you gonna do?\\" Me: \\"Peel.\\" > Him: \\"Which way?\\" Me: \\"Away from the guy, not towards him.\\" From September 2004 to April 2005, Walter was an assistant coach for the University of Pittsburgh inline hockey team. A long time friend of head coach Bob Coyne, Walter was hired by team president Ryan Gaus as an assistant coach, along with Bob Bradley and Tim Fryer.University of Pittsburgh Panthers Roller Hockey Team 2004–2005 Coaching Staff Pitt participated in the Eastern Collegiate Roller Hockey Association (ECRHA) at the Division I level.The Greater Ones – National Collegiate Roller Hockey Association Charity=CNIB Walter has been working for the CNIB (formerly the Canadian National Institute for the Blind). The entire Gretzky family is now associated with the CNIB. The Gretzky's support of the CNIB started when Walter’s son Wayne was 19 years old. Two completely blind boys started to talk to him, and one recognized Wayne just by his voice. Wayne felt a sense of compassion and persuaded his father to set up a golf tournament to raise cash for the CNIB. These tournaments soon gained fame and attracted NHL players and celebrities. Brendan Shanahan, the Toronto Maple Leafs, Brett Hull, Gordie Howe, Scott Stevens, Mark Messier, Marty McSorley, Glen Campbell and Paul Coffey are among hockey names that have attended. Celebrities who have attended include John Candy, Rob Lowe, Teri Garr, Alan Thicke, Jamie Farr, Bob Woods, Kevin Smith, and David Foster. All the money from these tournaments go across Canada to help visually impaired students have money and scholarships to go to universities. At the first tournament, Walter had enough money raised to award three scholarships; now he awards 15 scholarships a year. After eleven years, these tournaments had raised over three million dollars. SCORE program Another fundraiser that Walter Gretzky does is the SCORE program (Summer Computer Orientation Recreational Education). SCORE helps blind students learn computer skills that will be needed for jobs in the future and increases blind student’s access to computer programs and internet applications. So far SCORE has provided over 500 career positions for visually impaired students. Mementos Fans come to his house to see his basement, stuffed with mementos from Wayne's amateur career, and his backyard, which, every winter, was turned into a \\"rink\\" on which Walter taught his sons and their friends to play hockey. The \\"rink\\" was replaced by a swimming pool on the day Wayne was traded to the Los Angeles Kings. His other children – Kim, Keith, Glen, and Brent – were also athletic. Brent, drafted by the Tampa Bay Lightning, played 13 NHL games. Keith, drafted by the Buffalo Sabres in 1985, never made it to the NHL but has coached in the minors (he was Brent's coach when both were with the UHL Asheville Smoke). Kim was an exceptional track and field star, but broke her foot at the age of 15 and never ran again. Books Walter Gretzky has written two books: On Family, Hockey and Healing (2003), and Gretzky: From Backyard Rink to the Stanley Cup (1985), in which he recounted how he recognized Wayne's prodigious skills and shaped him into the most prolific scorer in hockey history. In an unusually frank 1990 interview with the Los Angeles Times, Wayne recounted how Walter would build him up one minute and tear him down the next, reminding him constantly that he could never have an \\"average\\" game. Personal Phyllis died of lung cancer at Brantford General Hospital on December 19, 2005. Her mother, Betty Hockin, died in Brantford on January 7, 2006 from complications from a heart attack. Walter Gretzky was named to the Order of Canada on 28 December 2007, \\"for his contributions to minor hockey in Canada and for his dedication to helping a myriad of local, provincial, and national charities.\\"\\"Walter Gretzky, Steve Nash named to Order of Canada.\\" CBC News, 28 Dec 2007. .

The aim of the poems is to demystify rural and small town American life. The collection includes 212 separate characters, in all providing 244 accounts of their lives, losses, and manner of death. Many of the poems contain cross-references that create an unabashed tapestry of the community. The poems originally were published in 1914 in the St. Louis, Missouri literary journal Reedy's Mirror, under the pseudonym Webster Ford. Content The first poem serves as an introduction: > \\"The Hill\\" > Where are Elmer, Herman, Bert, Tom and Charley, > The weak of will, the strong of arm, the clown, the boozer, the fighter? > All, all are sleeping on the hill. > One passed in a fever, > One was burned in a mine, > One was killed in a brawl, > One died in a jail, > One fell from a bridge toiling for children and wife— > All, all are sleeping, sleeping, sleeping on the hill. > Where are Ella, Kate, Mag, Lizzie and Edith, > The tender heart, the simple soul, the loud, the proud, the happy one?— > All, all are sleeping on the hill. > One died in shameful child-birth, > One of a thwarted love, > One at the hands of a brute in a brothel, > One of a broken pride, in the search for heart’s desire; > One after life in far-away London and Paris > Was brought to her little space by Ella and Kate and Mag— > All, all are sleeping, sleeping, sleeping on the hill. > Where are Uncle Isaac and Aunt Emily, > And old Towny Kincaid and Sevigne Houghton, > And Major Walker who had talked > With venerable men of the revolution?— > All, all are sleeping on the hill. > They brought them dead sons from the war, > And daughters whom life had crushed, > And their children fatherless, crying— > All, all are sleeping, sleeping, sleeping on the hill. > Where is Old Fiddler Jones > Who played with life all his ninety years, > Braving the sleet with bared breast, > Drinking, rioting, thinking neither of wife nor kin, > Nor gold, nor love, nor heaven? > Lo! he babbles of the fish-frys of long ago, > Of the horse-races of long ago at Clary’s Grove, > Of what Abe Lincoln said > One time at Springfield. > Each following poem is an autobiographical epitaph of a dead citizen, delivered by the dead themselves. Characters include Tom Merritt, Amos Sibley, Carl Hamblin, Fiddler Jones and A.D. Blood. They speak about the sorts of things one might expect: Some recite their histories and turning points, others make observations of life from the outside, and petty ones complain of the treatment of their graves, while few tell how they really died. The subject of afterlife receives only the occasional brief mention, and even those seem to be contradictory. Speaking without reason to lie or fear the consequences, they construct a picture of life in their town that is shorn of façades. The interplay of various villagers -- e.g. a bright and successful man crediting his parents for all he's accomplished, and an old woman weeping because he is secretly her illegitimate child -- forms a gripping, if not pretty, whole. Composition and publication history Many of the characters who make appearances in Spoon River Anthology were based on people that Masters knew or heard of in the two towns in which he grew up: Petersburg and Lewistown, Illinois. Masters sometimes substantially disguised the names of these real-life inspirations, but he sometimes disguised them only barely and, in a few cases, not at all. Most notable is Ann Rutledge, regarded in local legend to be Abraham Lincoln's early love interest (though there is no actual proof of such a relationship); Masters heard this legend from his grandfather. Rutledge's grave can be found in a Petersburg cemetery, and a tour of graveyards in both towns, especially Oak Hill Cemetery in Lewistown, reveals most of the surnames that Masters applied to his characters. After growing up and leaving Lewistown for Chicago, Masters met and befriended William Marion Reedy, the owner, publisher and editor of the St. Louis-based literary magazine Reedy's Mirror. By the time Masters wrote the poems that became Spoon River Anthology, he had published some poetry with some success; these prior poems, however, were more conventional in style and subject matter. Masters later wrote that it was Reedy, through his criticism and friendship, who encouraged him to write “something more distinctive than what I was doing, somehow, someway, but without telling me how to do it.” Masters in particular credited Reedy with introducing him to the Greek Anthology, a collection of classical period epigrams, to which Spoon River Anthology is stylistically similar. Spoon River Anthology originally was published in serial form in Reedy's Mirror from May 29, 1914 until January 5, 1915. The poems were attributed initially to the pseudonym Webster Ford. William Marion Reedy, owner, publisher and editor of the magazine revealed the poems’ true authorship in November 1914, after 21 weekly entries. The first bound edition of Spoon River Anthology was published by The Macmillan Company in 1915 with a total of 209 poems. Masters added 35 new poems in the 1916 edition, expanding on new characters with connections to some of the originals.http://spoonriveranthology.net/spoon/river/article/editionOrder Among these new additions were \\"Andy the Night-Watch\\", \\"Isa Nutter,\\" \\"Plymouth Rock Joe\\" and \\"The Epilogue.\\" Critical reception and legacy Spoon River Anthology was a critical and commercial success. Ezra Pound's review of the Spoon River poems begins: \\"At last! At last America has discovered a poet.\\" Carl Sandburg's review is similarly glowing: \\"Once in a while a man comes along who writes a book that has his own heart-beats in it. The people whose faces look out from the pages of the book are the people of life itself, each trait of them as plain or as mysterious as in the old home valley where the writer came from. Such a writer and book are realized here.\\" The book sold 80,000 copies over four years, making it an international bestseller by the standards of the day. Meanwhile, those who lived in the Spoon River region objected to their portrayal in the anthology, particularly as so many of the poems' characters were based on real people. The book was banned from Lewistown schools and libraries until 1974. Even Masters's mother, who sat on the Lewistown library board, voted for the ban. (Masters claimed \\"My mother disliked [the anthology]; my father adored it.\\" Despite this, the anthology remained widely read in Lewistown; local historian Kelvin Sampson notes that \\"Every family in Lewistown probably had a sheet of paper or a notebook hidden away with their copy of the Anthology, saying who was who in town.\\" Masters capitalized on the success of The Spoon River Anthology with the 1924 sequel The New Spoon River, in which Spoon River became a suburb of Chicago and its inhabitants have been urbanized. The second work was less successful and received poorer reviews. In 1933, Masters wrote a retrospective essay on the composition of The Spoon River Anthology and the response it received, entitled \\"The Genesis of Spoon River.\\" He recounts, among other things, the \\"exhaustion of body\\" that befell him while writing, which eventually manifested in pneumonia and a year-long bout of illness as the work was being prepared for publication. He claims that the Lewistown residents who strove to identify the poems' characters with real people did so only \\"with poor success.\\" More recently, Lewistown celebrated its relationship to Masters' poetry. The Oak Hill Cemetery features a memorial statue of Masters and offers a self-guided walking tour of the graves that inspired the poems. In 2015, the town celebrated the 100th anniversary of the anthology's publication with tours, exhibitions and theatrical performances. Today Spoon River Anthology often is assigned in high school and college literature classes and as a source of monologues for theatrical auditions. It is also often used in second year characterization work in the Meisner technique of actor training.

He served in the American Civil War, as well as for two subsequent decades before retiring as a rear admiral. Early life and career Wells was born in Reading, Pennsylvania, and attended school there. He was appointed as a midshipman in the Navy on September 25, 1840, and spent a year at the Mediterranean Station before serving at the Home Station from 1842 to 1843.

Its Roman name was Arpinum. In Roman times, the town produced two consuls of the Roman Republic: Gaius Marius and Marcus Tullius Cicero. History Pointed arch in the walls. The ancient city of Arpinum dates back to at least the 7th century BC. Connected with the Pelasgi, the Volsci and Samnite people, it was captured by the Romans and granted civitas sine suffragio in 305 BC. The city gained Roman suffrage in 188 BC and the status of a municipium in 90 BC. The town produced both Gaius Marius and Marcus Tullius Cicero, who were homines novi (people from new families who were elected to the Roman Senate, usually referring to those who had reached the office of Consul). Cicero, in speeches before the courts in Rome, would later praise his hometown's contributions to the Republic when attacked as a \\"foreigner\\", for Arpinum had twice borne men to save the Republic: Marius against the Cimbric invaders of 101 BC and Cicero himself against the Second Catilinarian conspiracy. Cicero in letters to his friend Atticus referred often to the peace and quiet of his beloved Arpinum. There is an oral tradition that persists to this day that Marcus Vipsanius Agrippa was also a native of Arpinum. Historians however have not been able to confirm his place of birth. Beside the ancient town of Arpinum there are the fortified remains of a much earlier Samnite town. The high defensive walls are of the polygonal type associated historically with these people. There is an example of an arch of this type which can still be still seen today. Dates are generally from the early Roman period to about 400 BC. The recent suggestions that these walls were created by some superior beings given their large size blocks is considered to be completely untrue and scurrilous. The Stone is some times referred to as puddingstone but in this case it seem to be of a more sedimentary dark gray type. Arpinum, Atina, and Cominium were known Samnite strongholds. The Valle di Comino nearby is considered to be strong Samnite and subsections of the tribes home lands and the language generally spoken up to the Roman assimilations was Oscan part of the \\"Co\\" group of Indo-European languages. Ancient Roman basalt pavement in Arpino In the early Middle Ages, the Roman duchy and the Duchy of Benevento contended for its strategic position. After the 11th century it was ruled by the Normans, the Hohenstaufen and by the Papal States. It was destroyed twice; in 1229 by Frederick II and in 1242 by Conrad IV. The castrato sopranist Gioacchino Conti, known as Il Gizziello or heb ceilliau, was born in Arpino in 1714. Main sights Attractions include the circuit walls in polygonal masonry.

Originally, and officially, known as the Monastery of Saint Mary of the Victory (), it was erected in commemoration of the 1385 Battle of Aljubarrota and would serve as the burial church of the 15th-century Aviz dynasty of Portuguese royalty. It is one of the best and original examples of Late Flamboyant Gothic architecture in Portugal, intermingled with the Manueline style.  History  Monastery of Santa Maria da Vitória. The monastery was built to thank the Virgin Mary for the Portuguese victory over the Castilians in the battle of Aljubarrota in 1385, fulfilling a promise of King John I of Portugal. The battle put an end to the 1383–85 Crisis. It took over a century to build, starting in 1386 and ending circa 1517, spanning the reign of seven kings. It took the efforts of fifteen architects (Mestre das Obras da Batalha), although for seven of them the title was merely honorary. The construction required an enormous effort, using extraordinary resources of men and material. New techniques and artistic styles, hitherto unknown in Portugal, were deployed. Cloister hall of the monastery. Work began in 1386 by the Portuguese architect Afonso Domingues, who continued until 1402. He drew up the plan, and many of the structures in the church and the cloister are his doing. His style was essentially Rayonnant Gothic; however, there are influences from the English Perpendicular Period. There are similarities with the façade of York Minster and with the nave and transept of Canterbury Cathedral. He was succeeded by Huguet from 1402 to 1438. This architect, who was probably of Catalan descent, introduced the Flamboyant Gothic style. This is manifest in the main façade, the dome of the square chapter house, the Founder's Chapel, the basic structure of the Imperfect Chapels and the north and east naves of the main cloister. He raised the height of the nave to 32.46 m. By altering the proportions he made the interior of the church seem even narrower. He also completed the transept, but he died before he could finish the Imperfect Chapels. Lateral view of the monastery and statue of Nuno Álvares Pereira. During the reign of Afonso V of Portugal, the Portuguese architect Fernão de Évora continued the construction between 1448 and 1477. He added the Cloister of Afonso V. He was succeeded by the architect Mateus Fernandes the Elder in the period 1480–1515. This master of the Manueline style worked on the portal of the Capelas Imperfeitas. Together with the famous Diogo Boitac he realized the tracery of the arcades in the Claustro Real. Work on the convent continued into the reign of John III of Portugal with the addition of the fine Renaissance tribune (1532) by João de Castilho. The construction came to a halt when the king decided to put all his efforts in the construction of the Jerónimos Monastery in Lisbon. The earthquake of 1755 did some damage, but much greater damage was inflicted by the Napoleonic troops of Marshal Masséna, who sacked and burned the complex in 1810 and 1811. When the Dominicans were expelled from the complex in 1834, the church and convent were abandoned and left to fall into ruin. In 1840, king Ferdinand II of Portugal started a restoration program of the abandoned and ruined convent, saving this jewel of Gothic architecture. The restoration would last till the early years of the 20th century. One of the last architects was master stonemason Jose Patrocinio de Sousa, responsible for rebuilding the monastery. It was declared a National Monument in 1907. In 1980 the monastery was turned into a museum. The Batalha convent was added in 1983 by UNESCO to its list of World Heritage sites.  Architecture tympanum and archivolts. The convent stands apart from the town. The western façade, facing the large square with its equestrian statue of general Nuno Álvares Pereira, is divided in three by buttresses and huge pilasters: the Founder's Chapel (Capelo do Fundador), the side wall of an aisle and the projecting portal. On the right side of this façade are the Unfinished Chapels (Capelas Imperfeitas), a separate octagonal structure added to the complex. Off the east side, next to the church choir is the Chapterhouse (Sala do Capitulo). The Cloister of King João I borders on the church and this chapterhouse. The structure continues into the cloister of King Afonso V (Claustro de D. Afonso V). On the northern side of the complex lies the Tomb of the Unknown Soldier from the First World War. The portal shows in the archivolt a profusion of 78 statues, divided over six rows, of Old Testament kings, angels, prophets and saints, each under a baldachin. The splays on both sides display (inferior copies of) statues of the apostles, with one standing on a chained devil. The tympanum shows Christ enthroned, sitting under a baldachin and flanked by the four Evangelists, each with his own attribute. Interior Nave and choir = Nave and choir = The church is vast and narrow (22 m) in proportion to its height (32.4 m). The nave was raised to its present height by the second architect, Huguet, altering the proportions of the church and giving it its present aspect. Its interior gives a sober and bare impression by its lack of ornaments and statues in the nave. The ribbed vaults, supported by compound piers, are closed by ornamented keystones. Light enters the church through ten stained- glass windows of the clerestory and the tall, traceried windows in the side walls and the transept and through the two rows of lanciform windows in the choir. The choir extends into two-bay transepts and consists of five apsidal chapels, with the central one projecting. Batalha probably had the first workshop for stained-glass windows in Portugal. The art was introduced to Portugal by German artists from the regions of Franconia and Nuremberg. The oldest windows date back to the end of the 1430s. But the Manueline, ogival stained-glass windows in the choir date from the 1520s and 1530s and were produced by Portuguese masters, among them Francisco Henriques. They represent scenes from the lives of Jesus and Mary: the Visitation, the Epiphany, the Flight into Egypt and the Resurrection of Christ. The architect Mateus Fernandes and his wife are buried under a marble tomb-slab close to the portal. The tomb of the knight Martim Gonçalves de Maçada, who saved the king's life during the battle at Aljubarrota, can be found close to the Capela do Fundador. = Founder's Chapel= Tomb of John I and Philippa The square Founder's Chapel () was built between 1426 and 1434 by the architect Huguet on orders of King John I to become the first royal pantheon in Portugal. It gives a perfect synthesis between Flamboyant Gothic and the English Perpendicular style, as Philippa of Lancaster had brought along a few English architects. The chapel consists of three notional bays and a central octagon buttressed by eight piers, adorned with crockets, supporting deeply stilted arches. The joint tomb of King John I of Portugal (d.1433) and his wife Philippa of Lancaster (d.1415) stands under the star vault of the octagon. Their statues lie in full regalia, with clasped hands (expressing the good relations between Portugal and England) and heads resting on a pillow, under elaborately ornamented baldachins. The coats of arms of the houses of Aviz and Lancaster are on top of these baldachins, together with the insignia of the Order of the Garter. On the cover plate of the tomb are inscribed in repetition the mottos of the king Por bem (\\"for the better\\") and of the queen Yl me plet (\\"I am pleased\\"). Tombs of the four princes (from left to right): Ferdinand, John, Henry, Peter This octagon is surrounded by an ambulatory with complex vaulting. At the south wall stand a row of recessed arches with the tombs of the four younger sons of John I, together with their spouses. From left to right: Ferdinand the Holy Prince (a bachelor, he died a prisoner in Fez in 1443; his bodily remains were later recovered and moved here in 1473); John of Reguengos, the Constable of Portugal (d.1442), with his wife Isabella of Barcelos (d.1466); Henry the Navigator (under a baldachin, d.1460, a bachelor); and Peter of Coimbra (regent for Afonso V, 1438–1448, who was killed at the Battle of Alfarrobeira in 1449; his remains were moved here in 1456) with his wife Isabella of Urgell (d.1459). The three tombs on the west wall are copies of the original tombs of King Afonso V (r.1438–1481), John II (r.1481–1495) (empty because Masséna's soldiers threw away the bones) and his son and heir, Prince Afonso (who died in an accident at the age of seventeen, predeceasing his father). = Unfinished Chapels = As Capelas Imperfeitas (The Unfinished Chapels) are a reminder that the monastery was never actually finished. They form a separate octagonal structure tacked on the choir of the church (via a retrochoir) and only accessible from the outside. It was commissioned in 1437 by King Edward of Portugal (\\"Dom Duarte\\", d.1438) as a second royal mausoleum for himself and his descendants. But he and his queen Eleanor of Aragon are the only ones buried here. (Eleanor died in exile in Toledo in 1445; her remains were moved here in 1456.) Interior of the Unfinished chapels The original design, begun by Huguet, was altered by successive architects, especially Mateus Fernandes (who is buried inside the church). The octagonal rotunda has seven radiating hexagonal chapels. In the corners of the chapels stand the massive unfinished buttresses that were intended to support the vault. These pillars, designed by Diogo Boitac, are decorated with Manueline motives carved in stone. The portal rises to a monumental fifteen metres. It was originally built in Gothic style, but was transformed beyond recognition by Mateus Fernandes into a masterpiece of Manueline style (completed in 1509). It is completely decorated into a lacework of sumptuous and stylized Manueline motives: armillary, spheres, winged angels, ropes, circles, tree stumps, clover-shaped arches and florid projections. This homage of King Manuel I to his predecessor King Edward mentions his motto Leauté faray tam yaserei (\\"I will always be loyal\\"). This motto is then repeated more than two hundred times in the arches, vaults and pillars of the chapels. The Renaissance loggia, added at about 1533, was probably meant for musicians. It is ascribed to the architect João de Castilho. = Chapterhouse = The Chapterhouse () reminds visitors of the military reason for the monastery's foundation: a military honor guard of two sentinels stands watch over the tombs of two unknown soldiers killed in World War I. This square room is especially notable for its star vault lacking a central support and spanning a space of 19 square meters. This was such a daring idea at the time that condemned prisoners were used to perform the task. It was completed after two failed attempts. When the last scaffolds were removed, it is said that Huguet spent the night under the vault to silence his critics. The stained-glass Renaissance window in the east wall dates from 1508. It depicts scenes of the Passion and is attributed to the Portuguese painters Master João and Francisco Henriques. = Royal Cloister = King John I Cloisters of Batalha Monastery. The Royal Cloister () was not part of the original project. It was built under the architect Fernão de Évora between 1448 and 1477. Its sober outward appearance is in stark contrast with the Flamboyant Gothic style of the church. The carved tracery decoration in Gothic style (including quatrefoils, fleurs-de-lis and rosettes) by Huguet in the ambulatory forms a successful combination with the Manueline style in the arcade screens, added later by Mateus Fernandes. Two different patterns alternate, one with the cross of the Order of Christ, the other with armillaries. The colonettes, supporting these intricate arcade screens, are decorated with spiral motives, armillaries, lotus blossoms, briar branches, pearls and shells and exotic vegetation. = Lavabo= Situated in the northwestern corner of the Claustro Real, this work of Mateus Fernandes consists of a fountain and two smaller basins above, illuminated by light seeping through the intricate tracery of the arches around it. = Cloister of King Afonso= This sober cloister next to the Claustro Real was built in conventional Gothic style with double pointed arches. It was constructed in the second half of the 15th century by the architect Fernão de Évora. It stands in contrast with the Manueline flamboyance of the somewhat larger Claustro Real. The keystones in the vault carry the coat-of-arms of D. Duarte I and Afonso V.

Alexander (November 18, 1929 – August 20, 2018) was an American zoologist who was a professor at the University of Michigan and curator at the university's museum of zoology of in Ann Arbor, Michigan. His scientific pursuits integrated the fields of systematics, ecology, evolution, natural history and behaviour. The salient organisms in his research are wide-ranging, from the orthopterans (grasshoppers, katydids and crickets) and cicadidae (cicadas) to vertebrates: dogs, horses, and primates, including humans. Biography Alexander obtained an associate of arts degree from Blackburn College (Carlinville, Illinois) in 1948, a bachelor of science in education (biology) and a PhD from Ohio State University in 1956. He joined the University of Michigan faculty in 1957. He was the Donald Ward Tinkle Professor of Evolutionary Biology from 1984–89 and was named the Theodore H. Hubbell Distinguished University Professor of Evolutionary Biology in 1989\\\\. He served as director of the Museum of Zoology from 1993–98. Alexander taught for over 40 years two graduate courses in alternate fall semesters: evolutionary ecology and evolution and behaviour; during these semesters he dedicated all his time to prepare his lecture materials — fresh and up-to-date every year — which included many a time novel, provocative ideas from his own students and university colleagues; amongst which Prof. Donald W. Tinkle, curator of herpetology at the UMMZ and evolutionary biologist, was very prominent until his death in 1980. His course lectures were perhaps the most popular in the schools of natural sciences and natural resources at the university and were often attended by other faculty members and visiting students including many from the social sciences (anthropology, geography, sociology, psychology, etcetera). In 1974 he created a detailed model for a eusocial vertebrate, having no idea that a mammal with these characteristics actually existed. It turned out that his hypothetical eusocial rodent was a \\"perfect description\\" of the naked mole-rat (Heterocephalus glaber). Publications Alexander's publications related to the evolution of behaviour and its bearing on human nature. After his retirement in 2000, he devoted most of his time to his horse farm, where he bred, reined, trained and rode them. On humans Books: * Darwinism and Human Affairs. Seattle: U.

It is composed of 19 villages with an overall leader called Eze Aro. Arochukwu is a principal historic town in Igbo land. It was also one of the cities in the Southern protectorate targeted by the British colonial government. Several historic tourist sites exist in the city. The mystic Ibini Ukpabi shrine, the slave routes and other relics of the slave trade era are frequently visited by tourists. It is also in the food belt of Abia state where most of the staple foods are produced.  History  Arochukwu is believed to have been the homeland of the Ibibio as they arrived in 300 AD from the Benue valley and founded early states like Obong Okon Ita and Ibom. Many years passed as Igbo immigrants came along and pressed into the Ibibio occupied territory and founded several states. The first Igbo group were the Ezeagwu group from Enugu led by their leader Agwu Inobia. As Aro- Ibibio wars occurred, there was a stalemate. In reaction, the Eze Agwu clan invited a priest named Nnachi from the Edda clan of northeastern Igboland and another group from the east of the Cross River through Nnachi. These people were identified as the Akpa people. Akpa forces led by Osim and Akuma Nnubi, they helped the Igbo forces capture the rest of the area. This formed the alliance of 19 new and old states in the area known as the Arochukwu kingdom around 1650–1700. The first king (or Eze Aro) of a unified Arochukwu was Akuma but after his death, Nnachi son's Oke Nnachi took over and his descendants have the throne to this day. By the mid-18th century, Arochukwu people founded many other communities both within and outside Igboland.Afigbo, AE. Groundwork of Igbo History. Lagos, Vista Books Limited, 1992Onwuejeogwu, MA. Igbo civilization: Nri kingdom and hegemony; London, Ethnographica, 1981 These migrations, influence of their god Ibini Ukpabi through priests, and their military power backed up by alliances with several related neighboring Igbo and eastern Cross River militarized states (particularly Ohafia, Abam, Abiriba, Afikpo, Ekoi, etc.) quickly established the Aro Confederacy as a regional economic power. However, Aro economic hegemony was threatened by the penetration of Europeans, mainly British colonists in the wake of the 20th century. Tensions finally led to bloodshed and the Anglo-Aro War took place from 1901–1902. The Aro Confederacy stoutly resisted but were eventually defeated. This helped the British to occupy the rest of what is now known as Eastern Nigeria. Demography The kingdom is Igbo mixed with Ibibio and Akpa. The main language in Arochukwu is Igbo while Ibibio is also spoken. The population of Arochukwu town is 10,776.

Development of Hungarian railways 1846-1913 1846-1918 The first steam locomotive railway line was opened on 15 July 1846 between Pest and Vác. This date is regarded as the birth date of the Hungarian railways. The Romantic poet Sándor Petőfi, later a leader of the Hungarian Revolution of 1848, rode on the first train and wrote an occasional poem, predicting that rails would connect Hungary like blood vessels in the human body. After the failed revolution, the existing lines were nationalized by the Austrian State and new lines were built. As a result of the Austro-Sardinian War in the late 1850s, all these lines were sold to Austrian private companies. During this time the company of Ábrahám Ganz invented a method of \\"crust-casting\\" to produce cheap yet sturdy iron railway wheels, which greatly contributed to railway development in Central Europe. Following the Austro-Hungarian Compromise of 1867 that created the Dual Monarchy of Austria-Hungary, transport issues became the responsibility of the Hungarian Government, which also inherited the duty to support local railway companies. This came at a considerable cost: in the 1874 fiscal year 8% of the annual budget went to railway company subsidies. This led the Hungarian Parliament to consider founding a State Railway in 1868. The goal was to take over and operate the Hungarian main lines. The branch lines were constructed by private companies. When the law in 1884 provided a simplified way to create Railway Companies many small branch line companies were founded. These, however, usually only constructed the lines, then made a contract with MÁV to operate them. Thus they also owned no locomotives or other rolling stock. MÁV made a contract only if the line, its equipment and buildings were constructed to MÁV standards. This helped to build standard station buildings, sheds, and accessories, all to the MÁV rules. Because of relatively high prices the traffic density was considerably lower in Hungary than in other countries. To change this the Interior Minister, Gábor Baross, introduced the zone tariff system in 1889. This system resulted in lower prices for passenger trips and goods transport but it induced a rapid increase in both and so higher overall profits. In 1891 the Hungarian lines of the StEG were bought by the Hungarian State directly from the French owners and became MÁV lines. In 1890 most large private railway companies were nationalized as a consequence of their poor management, except the strong Austrian-owned Kaschau-Oderberg Railway (KsOd) and the Austrian-Hungarian Southern Railway (SB/DV). They also joined the zone tariff system, and remained successful until the end of World War I when Austria-Hungary collapsed. By 1910 MÁV had become one of the largest European railway companies, in terms of both its network and its finances. Its profitability, however, always lagged most Western European companies, be they publicly or privately owned. The Hungarian railway infrastructure was largely completed in these years, with a topology centred on Budapest that still remains. By 1910, the total length of the rail networks of the Hungarian Kingdom reached , the Hungarian network linked more than 1,490 settlements. Nearly half (52%) of the Austro-Hungarian Empire's railways were built in Hungary, thus the railroad density there became higher than that of Cisleithania. This has ranked Hungarian railways the 6th most dense in the world (ahead of countries as Germany or France). In 1911 a new locomotive numbering system was introduced which was used until the beginning of the 21st century and is still in use for motive power purchased before then. The notation specifies the number of driven axles and the maximum axle load of the locomotive. =The Hungarian Locomotive (engines and wagons bridge and iron structures) factories= Despite the Hungarian factories were independent companies, the largest suppliers of MÁV were the MÁVAG company in Budapest (steam engines and wagons) and the Ganz company in Budapest (steam engines, wagons, the production of electric locomotives and electric trams started from 1894). and the RÁBA Company in Győr.

In 1894, Kálmán Kandó developed high-voltage three-phase AC motors and generators for electric locomotives. The first-ever electric rail vehicle manufactured by Ganz Works was a 6 HP pit locomotive with direct current traction system. The first Ganz made asynchronous rail vehicles (altogether 2 pieces) were supplied in 1898 to Évian-les-Bains (Switzerland), with a , asynchronous-traction system. The Ganz Works won the tender of electrification of railway of Valtellina Railways in Italy in 1897. Italian railways were the first in the world to introduce electric traction for the entire length of a main line, rather than just a short stretch. The Valtellina line was opened on 4 September 1902, designed by Kandó and a team from the Ganz works. The electrical system was three-phase at 3 kV 15 Hz. The voltage was significantly higher than used earlier, and it required new designs for electric motors and switching devices. In 1918, Kandó invented and developed the rotary phase converter, enabling electric locomotives to use three-phase motors whilst supplied via a single overhead wire, carrying the simple industrial frequency (50 Hz) single phase AC of the high voltage national networks. 1918-1939 At the end of World War I, after the peace treaty of Trianon that reduced Hungarian territory by 72%, the railway network was cut from around (the long MÁV-owned network decreased to ). The number of freight cars was 102,000 at the end of World War I, but after 1921 only 27,000 remained in Hungary, of which 13,000 were in working order. The total number of locomotives was 4,982 in 1919, but after the peace treaty, only 1,666 remained in Hungary. As many existing railway lines crossed Hungary's new borders, most of these branch lines were abandoned. On the main lines, new border stations had to be constructed with customs facilities and locomotive service. Between the world wars, development focused on existing multiple- track lines and adding a second track to most main lines. An electrification process started, based on Kálmán Kandó's patent on a single-phase 16 kV 50 Hz AC traction and his newly designed MÁV Class V40 locomotive, which used a rotary phase converter unit to transform the catenary high voltage current into multiphase current with regulated low voltage that fed the single multi- phase AC induction traction motor. Most main lines' cargo and passenger trains were hauled by the MÁV Class 424 steam locomotive, which became the MÁV's workhorse in the late steam era. From 1928 onwards 4- and 6-wheeled gasoline (and later diesel) railcars were purchased (Class BCmot) and by 1935 57% of branch lines were served by railcars. The rest of MÁV's passenger network remained steam based with slow pre-war locomotives and 3rd class \\"wooden bench\\" carriages (called in Hungarian, a name nowadays applied to low cost airlines). In the early 1930s, almost all Hungarian branch line operators went bankrupt because of the Great Depression. DSA, the Hungarian successor to the former Austrian-Hungarian Southern Railway, went into receivership. MÁV took over DSA's branch lines and all property in 1932 and continued to operate them. MÁV thus became the only major railway operator in Hungary, the impact of the few other independent railway companies (GySEV, AEGV) being negligible. 1939-1950 MÁV Siemens Taurus at Szőny During late World War II the Hungarian railway system suffered tremendous destruction. More than half the main lines and a quarter of the branch lines were inoperable. 85% of all bridges were destroyed, 28% of all buildings were ruined and another 32% of them inoperable. The rolling stock was either destroyed or distributed to many other European countries. Only 213 locomotives, 120 railcars (there was no fuel in the last days of the war to move them away), 150 passenger cars and 1,900 freight cars were in working order. These were prized and signed as \\"trophies\\" by the Soviet Red Army. After World War II the track, buildings and service equipment were repaired with tremendous efforts in relatively short time. By 1948 most of the railway system was operable, some larger bridges needing more time to be rebuilt. The first electrified section was already in use by October 1945. The Red Army sold back the confiscated rolling stock and locomotives were returned from Austria and Germany. To accelerate reconstruction MÁV purchased 510 USATC S160 Class locomotives which became MAV Class 411. 1950-2000 MÁV Siemens Desiro Diesel at Óbuda Station in Budapest In the 1950s, an accelerated industrialization was ordered by the Hungarian Socialist Workers' Party and the railway was considered a backbone of these efforts. Overloaded trains were hauled by badly maintained locomotives on poor quality tracks. Unrealistic Five Year Plans were specified; not fulfilling them was considered sabotage. After accidents, railway workers were given show trials and sometimes even sentenced to death. All the time the production of steam locomotives continued, but at first in small numbers, as the Hungarian industry was fully booked producing Soviet war reparations. This included steam locomotives to Soviet designs, passenger and freight cars, and many other goods. The development of diesel locomotives started. The successor of the Kandó V40 locomotives, the Class V55 proved to be a failure and MÁV decided to purchase no more phase converter engines. During the 1956 Hungarian Revolution the railways were not seriously damaged. After the suppressed Revolution the system of Five-Year Plans was reintroduced but with lower targets. In 1958 steam locomotive manufacturing stopped in Hungary. 600 HP diesel-electric locomotives (Class M44) and 450 HP diesel hydraulic switchers (Class M31) were manufactured. Inside of an InterCity carriage By 1964, the German-designed, domestically-built MÁV Class V43 four- axle 25 kV AC 50 Hz electric locomotive entered service and eventually some 450 of this reliable engine became the workhorse of MÁV traction in passenger as well as freight service. Heavy diesel engines arrived from the USSR (M62) and Sweden/United States (M61). Track maintenance, however, always remained poor, preventing the rolling stock from using the system to its fullest. To this day (particularly ) remains the top speed for trains in Hungary, though EU funds have become available to upgrade the network, especially tracks of the Trans-European Transport Networks. (Since Hungary lies in Central Europe, many important railway lines go through the country.) During the 1990s the state-owned MÁV gradually abandoned its most rural routes, but large scale passenger service cuts were blocked by political pressure. Still, the quality of general passenger service deteriorated considerably since Hungary converted to capitalism, as MÁV became focused on the more profitable cargo business. Relatively few people have access to the higher-quality \\"Intercity\\" express trains because of the unbalanced topography of the Hungarian railway network. Further expansion is also hampered by the shortage of high-quality passenger carriages. 2000-2010 Edmonson tickets.alt= MÁV-START carriage in Zürich As the post-2000 Hungarian political establishment became very much focused on the perceived \\"autobahn-gap\\" compared to better-routed Slovakia and especially Croatia and decided to upgrade the highway system, there was no significant domestic funding for developing the Hungarian Railway especially for the small regional lines. Recent developments include the purchase of twelve Siemens Desiro diesel railbuses for commuter routes and the order for Swiss Stadler Flirts, a type of very advanced electric self-propelled train for medium range shuttle paths, which is mired in a selection scandal against Bombardier's more established, but conservatively engineered Talent trains. The GySEV Győr-Sopron-Ebenfurti Vasút Rt. line (connecting two Hungarian and one Austrian city) is managed jointly by the two states. In 2006 the government was elected for promises, among those are making the lines between cities double-tracked, electrified, and validated for 160 km/h (by this transferring highway-cargo of companies to more environment-friendly, faster and greater capacity transportation). This was supposed to be done by first building the new track then building the remaining one in the place of the original one. The only possible way to finance the project was with the help of EU funds. EU supervision revised the plans and the projected cost but this delayed starting. During construction, the actual billings were also checked. Because of the delay and the lengthy construction works, most of the lines are still not opened in the planned state. The building works are largely forgotten by public consciousness because of the following: On 7 December 2006, as part of a broader economic restriction package, the Hungarian government announced its intention to stop operation on 14 regional lines with a total length of . The government, referring to an obligation under the constitution, ensured access to public transit in all settlements by installing bus routes and buses from Volánbusz Mass-Transit Company. This in cases when single railway stations served multiple villages, meant bus stations were established in the centers or ends of each settlement. This and increasing frequency theoretically can be done while eliminating the high fuel (diesel or electricity) consumption of the trains and their maintenance cost. A very common Stadler Flirt at Pilisvörösvár The first plans of János Kóka, Minister of the Economy and Transport, were more radical, abandoning 26 lines (or 12% of the entire network), but they were met with strong opposition from the local municipalities, parliamentary opposition parties and civic organizations. The main opposition party claimed that these measures were directed against more rural areas, especially small villages. The issue was heavily politicized. People considered the buses less safe or fast, especially in winter. Since the government wanted to avoid costly environmental protection and recultivation regulations, the railway lines will not be formally ceased, with the tracks removed, just the service suspended indefinitely. However, because of widespread scrap metal theft in Hungary, this effectively means the tracks are written off. On 4 March 2007 service was suspended on 14 lines: Pápa-Környe, Pápa-Csorna, Zalabér-Zalaszentgrót, Lepsény-Hajmáskér, Sellye-Villány, Diósjenő-Romhány, Kisterenye-Kál-Kápolna, Mezőcsát-Nyékládháza, Kazincbarcika-Rudabánya, Nyíradony-Nagykálló, Békés- Murony, Kunszentmiklós-Dunapataj, Fülöpszállás-Kecskemét and Kiskőrös-Kalocsa. Many of these have since been reopened by the new government. On 20 April 2007, the Index news web portal published material from internal MÁV studies, which indicated the new company leadership and the government intend to close all small regional railway lines after 2008, to eliminate sources of reincurring unfinanced expenses at MÁV (the to-be-closed lines' expenses are ten times as large as their incomes). This would leave only the international railway lines and large rural-to-town routes running. However, in 2010, when Fidesz returned to power, the new government announced that they would undo a plethora of transportation decisions made by the socialists. Ten rural railway lines, previously closed with the reason of low revenues, were reopened with much fanfare. The government states both bus and railway system have to be developed, and most settlements shouldn't be limited to have only one type of station. 2013 In February 2013, for the first time in its history, the railway started to train women drivers. The Times quoted a spokesman as saying that since there are no steam trains, there is no need for heavy lifting.Először ülhet nő mozdonyra  Stadler KISS  MÁV-Start Stadler KISS in Dunakeszi MÁV-Start entered into a framework contract with Stadler in 2017 for the purchase of a maximum of 40, 6-train unit motor trains, of which 11 will be the first installments. The wagon body and bogie of the motor trains is assembled in Szolnok, the non-driven middle wagon section and the final assembly of the trains take place at the Dunakeszi Vehicle Repair, so the domestic production rate of the trains will be more than 50%. In 2018, MÁV- Start called for an additional 8 motor trains, and in 2019, preparations for drawing up the remaining 21 began. Trains will run on the Budapest-Cegléd- Szolnok and Budapest-Szob railway lines from 2020, both of which are the busiest in the country. On 16 July 2019, the first motor train, numbered 815,001, was publicly displayed. All trains are expected to operate on the Budapest suburban lines by 2021.

He is considered one of the pioneering figures in defining the Asian Underground genre by mixing disparate genres of music such as Indian classical and folk with electronica, rock, pop and ambient music. In addition to production, remixing, and DJ work, Kale is known for his tabla drumming and film composition. Biography=Early life Born as Utkarsh Kale on 1 November 1974 to Indian Marathi speaking immigrants in West Bromwich, UK, Kale was raised in Stony Brook, New York after his parents relocated in 1977. Kale took an interest in drums and eventually became a tabla player. His father introduced him to a broad range of music, which included traditional Indian music, classical, rock, and even early hip-hop. From this broad range of influences, Kale, who was self-taught, developed his own style, which eventually led to his \\"electric tabla\\". Tabla Beat Science In 2000, Bill Laswell founded Tabla Beat Science, inviting Kale, along with Zakir Hussain, Talvin Singh, Trilok Gurtu and Sultan Khan. Together, the group released Tala Matrix that year. The album is considered to be one of the most influential Asian Fusion albums to date, and the group embarked on a tour, of which one of the shows was later released on DVD. Solo career While a Music Production and Performance student at New York University, Kale began playing in bands and working as a session musician. In 1999, Kale began work on his first EP, Classical Science Fiction from India and began hosting bi-weekly \\"Futureproof\\" events, which consisted of DJ and electric tabla sets. These events attracted the attention of San Francisco label Six Degrees Records. Soon after, Kale became the first Indo-American to be signed to a solo recording contract in the United States, a move which was followed by Kale's first full-length album, Realize, in 2001.\\"CD REVIEWS: Eric's Trip, Corrosion Of Conformity, Arling & Cameron and many more\\". Chart Attack, August 07, 2001. Paul Gangadeen Realize, often considered as a major milestone in what Kale called \\"Asian Massive\\", was followed with 2002's Asian Massive Tour, which also featured Midival Punditz and Cheb i Sabbah, and 2003's Liberation. Zakir Hussain also was featured in the album and in the major attraction of the album \\"Milan\\". Kale's third album, 2006's Broken English, was predominantly set to English lyrics, a shift from his previous albums. His follow-up Breathing Under Water, released in 2007, was the result of a two-year collaboration with sitar instrumentalist Anoushka Shankar. In 2011, Kale released Cinema, which is influenced by Kale's experiences in composing for Bollywood. He also won GIMA Awards best fusion album for the same, beating A.R.Rahman. Other work Kale has composed for crossover and Bollywood films including Chutney Popcorn, Indian Cowboy, Ocean of Pearls, and Pyaar Impossible!. His tracks have also been featured in shows such as HBO's True Blood and Real Time with Bill Maher. Two of his songs were included in as sample music in Windows Vista by Microsoft. Kale's songwriting credits include songs with Sting and Norah Jones, and has remixed songs by artists including Paula Cole, Yoko Ono, and The Cure. Kale also worked with Midival Punditz on a rescoring of Bruce Lee's Enter the Dragon. In 2012 Kale was one of an esteemed group of music producers selected to take part in MTV India's music incubation project: Coke Studio for its second season. Working with Indian artists including Warren Mendonsa, Monali Thakur, Benny Dayal, Apeksha Dandekar and more, he produced some of the series most innovative and well received tracks.

Often simply referred to by her given name \\"Momoe,\\" Yamaguchi is one of the most successful singers in Japanese music, releasing 32 singles, including three number one hits, and 21 studio albums. She also starred in 15 feature films and several television serial dramas. At age 21, Yamaguchi retired at the height of her popularity to marry her frequent costar, Tomokazu Miura; she has never performed or made a public appearance since. Therefore, she is called a legendary idol in Japan.  Biography =Early life and career Momoe Yamaguchi was born in Tokyo, Japan in 1959. Not long afterwards she was left in the care of her maternal grandparents. At around four, she returned to her parents and the family then moved to Yokohama. Without her father, a medical doctor who was already married to another women with children, having never married her mother. The family moved once again to Yokosuka. Her mother raised Momoe and her younger sister Toshie by herself. Toshie Yamaguchi studied in the states from part of high school to college while Momoe made a life in Japan. Momoe has a niece in the US who she has never met. Yamaguchi began a career in show business while she was still a student in junior high school. At the end of 1972, at the age of 13, Yamaguchi, along with many of her schoolmates, applied by postcard to appear on the idol talent search television show Star Tanjō!. After a series of successful preliminary auditions, she appeared on the show covering a hit song \\"Kaiten Mokuba\\",, lit. \\"Merry-go-round\\" by Yumi Makiba earlier that year. Though she finished second, Yamaguchi received offers from several music producers, and signed with Hori Productions. Her family moved to Tokyo. Yamaguchi transferred to Shinagawa Joshi Gakuin, and then attended Hinode Joshi Gakuin High School, a school which allows its students to carry on careers in show business. Initially she was promoted together with two other singers, Junko Sakurada and Masako Mori, as the Hana no Chūsan Torio (meaning \\"The lovely trio of third-year middle school students\\") since they were all in the third year of middle school (chūsan). Her first single, \\"Toshigoro\\", coupled with her first movie of the same title, did not fare well in the charts, peaking at 37 on the Oricon singles chart. But her second single \\"Aoi Kajitsu\\" peaked at number 9. Japanese pop culture historians have credited its success to its suggestive lyrics. The chorus goes \\"You can do what ever you want with me; it's OK if rumors spread that I'm a bad girl\\". Anata ga nozumu nara, watashi nani o sarete mo ii wa. ikenai musume da to uwasa sarete mo ii. Her early songs were written for her by the Hori Productions songwriting team of composer Shunichi Tokura and lyricist Kazuya Senge. One of her biggest hits was her 5th single \\"Hito natsu no Keiken\\" (\\"an experience one summer\\"), which includes lyrics like \\"I'll give you the most precious thing a girl has\\"., Anata ni onna no ko no ichiban taisetsu na mono o ageru wa. and \\"Everyone experiences it at least once, the sweet trap of seduction\\"., Dare demo ichido dake keiken suru no yo, yūwaku no amai wana. The suggestive lyrics attracted widespread press interest. The young singer was frequently asked salacious questions such as \\"What do you think a girl's most precious thing is?\\", to which she replied magokoro (\\"her devotion\\"). Rising popularity By the end of 1974, her phenomenal popularity was demonstrated by her being invited to be the opening female singer for the 25th Kōhaku Uta Gassen, Japan's most popular musical show, with the song Hito Natsu No Keiken. She would continue to appear in this show every year until her retirement. With her increasing popularity, Yamaguchi gained more control over her career and was able to select her own songwriters. One of her choices was Ryudo Uzaki. She chose him because she liked his song \\"Secret Love\\", recorded by the Down Town Boogie Woogie Band. Their first collaboration resulted in the single \\"Yokosuka Story\\" in 1976, written by Uzaki with lyrics by his wife, Yoko Aki. Aki was inspired to write the song because both she and Yamaguchi, whom she had never met when the song was originally ordered, had both lived in Yokosuka. \\"Yokosuka Story\\" was Yamaguchi's biggest hit, selling more than 600,000 copies, and peaked at number one on the charts. This was the beginning of a collaboration with the husband and wife songwriting team which only ended with Yamaguchi's retirement. Songs were also written for her by writers such as Masashi Sada, who wrote one of her most popular hits, \\"Cosmos\\". Her popularity as a singer was paralleled by rising success in a series of films and television programs. Her second film, Izu no Odoriko, paired her with actor Tomokazu Miura, chosen because he had previously done a commercial for Glico with her. Although Yamaguchi was 15 while Miura was 22, they had great screen chemistry, and became known as the Momoe-Tomokazu \\"golden combi\\".ゴールデン・コンビ They starred together in a total of 14 of her 17 movies, one every winter and summer. As she became popular, her father, Kubo, decided to cash in on her success. He held bogus \\"press conferences\\" unauthorized by either Yamaguchi or her management company, and in various ways disrupted her career. Since Yamaguchi was still a minor, he sued for the right of parental authority. shinken The court case ended in a victory for her mother. Yamaguchi declared in her autobiographical book that she ended her relationship with her father, and would never acknowledge his existence again. She also expressed the regret that if she had not become famous, this would not have happened. By the end of her career, Yamaguchi's music became more sophisticated. Her 12th and 18th albums, Golden Flight and L.A. Blue, were recorded in London and Los Angeles respectively, using local musicians and production staff. Her 21st album, Phoenix Densetsu, was written as a rock opera. Because she wanted to make a rock song before she ended her career, Uzaki and Aki wrote \\"Rock 'n Roll Widow\\" for her, which was included on the concept album Moebius's Game. When her television series were broadcast in China in the 1980s, she also became hugely popular as an actress there. In China she is known as 山口百惠 (the final character is slightly different from that used in Japan), pronounced \\"Shan Kou Bai Hui\\". According to a 2000 poll by the \\"News Station\\" news magazine programme, she was the Japanese person known most widely among the Chinese. Marriage and retirement With the on-screen romances between Yamaguchi and Tomokazu Miura, an off-screen romance grew. During a trip to Hawaii in early 1979, Miura proposed to Yamaguchi. She accepted, and she also said that she would retire from entertainment to marry him. Yamaguchi announced their relationship at a concert in October 1979, and the announcement about their marriage date and her retirement was made in March 1980. Billboard magazine stated in 1980 that the farewell concert by Momoe Yamaguchi was expected to gross $2.22 million. She performed the farewell concert at the Nippon Budokan on 5 October 1980, released her last album This is my trial on 21 October 1980, and released her last single \\"Ichie\\" on 19 November 1980. By the time of her retirement, Yamaguchi was responsible for over 25% of the sales at Horipro. She also wrote the lyrics to this song under the pen name \\"Kei Yokosuka\\", and continued to write a few songs for a while after retirement, such as Ann Lewis's La Saison from 1982. In her autobiographical book, Aoi Toki, she said that she disliked repeatedly singing the same songs. She also stated that she wanted to stop working to devote all her time to the wellbeing of her husband. She also said in an interview at the time of retirement that she did not want to continue working as a singer or an actress. On 15 October 1980, Yamaguchi officially retired from show business, and on 19 November 1980, the pair were married. Despite several rumors of her comeback, she has devoted herself to being a homemaker and mother to two sons. Her husband, Tomokazu Miura, continued to work as an actor, even though his career up to then had mostly consisted of playing romantic leads in her films and television series. After retirement In 1981, she wrote a book of autobiographical essays called Aoi Toki, which sold over a million copies in its first month of publication. Despite her retirement, she is a regular feature in weekly entertainment magazines. Her family suffered considerable difficulty in attending school events due to television crews and photographers, who sometimes used deception to gain access. Fans have frequently been found hanging around her residence, and in at least one case a fan even broke in. In 1999, her husband, Tomokazu Miura, wrote a part- autobiography Hishatai detailing the problems the couple had faced. Her two sons, Yūtarō and Takahiro Miura, both also entered careers in entertainment. Yūtarō entered the music business under the pseudonym \\"Yū\\" in a now-defunct group called \\"Peaky Salt\\". Initially it was not known that he was Momoe and Tomokazu's son. Takahiro is an actor who has appeared in several films and television programs. Takahiro is also a qualified lifeguard because he was a swimmer and surf lifesaver from high school and university. Yamaguchi's hobby is quilt making, and she exhibits her quilts under her married name, \\"Momoe Miura\\". In 2011, she was selected in a poll as \\"The ideal mother\\". New musical products continue to go on sale, such as a boxed DVD set of her appearances on television program Yoru No Hitto Sutajio (\\"Evening Hit Studio\\") in 2010. In a November 2011 television interview, Ryudo Uzaki said that she still receives a healthy income from record royalties. Her television dramas continue to be available on DVD, and from 2010 have been repeated daily on the TBS Channel cable television station. In 2011, Tomokazu Miura wrote a book entitled Aishō (compatibility) explaining the secret of their happy marriage. In 2012, the couple came first for the seventh consecutive year in a poll by the Meiji Yasuda life insurance company to find \\"the ideal celebrity couple\\" as considered by married people in their 20s to 50s.

Covers Her songs are regularly covered by other performers. Ayako Fuji released an \\"enka\\" version of her hit Manjushaka in 2003. Cosmos has been covered by many artists, including its creator, Masashi Sada, as well as Akina Nakamori. Imitation Gold was covered by Tak Matsumoto with Mai Kuraki in 2003. In 2004, a tribute album Yamaguchi Momoe Toribyuto Thank You For ... appeared of Yamaguchi covers by singers such as Masaharu Fukuyama, Sowelu, and Hiromi Iwasaki. A second volume, Yamaguchi Momoe Toribyuto Thank You For ... Part 2, with more covers, came out in 2005. In the 1980s, Chinese-language versions of some of her songs, such as \\"Manjushaka\\" () as , or \\"Rock'n'Roll Widow\\" as \\"\\" were released by Hong Kong singer Anita Mui. In English, in 1991 The Nolans released an album of songs entitled \\"Playback Part 2\\" containing well-known Yamaguchi songs with English lyrics. (The lyrics are largely newly written rather than translations of the originals, although some of the English parts of the originals are preserved.) This was re-issued as \\"The Nolans Sing Momoe 2005\\" in 2005. These albums were released only in Japan. Rina Rahman covered her song \\"Akai Unmei\\" in Malay language, entitled \\"Ku Ingin Bahagia\\".  Filmography = Films  Apart from her first film Toshigoro and two concert films, all of Yamaguchi's films, from Izu no odiroko on, were romantic stories costarring Tomokazu Miura. Many of them were directed by Katsumi Nishikawa and were remakes of the director's own films. Except for White Love (set in Spain) and Furimukeba Ai (set in San Francisco), almost all of the romantic films with Miura were based on Japanese literary works. * Toshigoro () (directed by Ichimura) * Izu no Odoriko () (from the short story \\"The Dancing Girl of Izu\\" by Yasunari Kawabata) (directed by Katsumi Nishikawa) * Shiosai () (directed by Katsumi Nishikawa) * Onēchan Ote Yawaraka ni () (as herself, her only non-starring role) * Zesshō () (1975) (directed by Katsumi Nishikawa) * Eden no Umi () (directed by Katsumi Nishikawa) * Kaze tachinu () (directed by Mitsuo Wakasugi) * Shunkinshō () (directed by Katsumi Nishikawa) * Doro darake no Junjō () (directed by Sokichi Tomimoto) * Kiri no Hata (), (directed by Katsumi Nishikawa) * Furimukeba Ai (), (directed by Nobuhiko Obayashi), also titled Take me away! * Honō no Mai () (directed by Yoshisuke Kawasaki) * White Love () (directed by Tsugunobu Kotani) * Tenshi o Yuwaku () (directed by Toshiya Fujita) * Koto () (1980) (directed by Kon Ichikawa) =Concert films= * Hana no Kō Ni Torio Hatsukoi Jidai () * Masako, Junko, Momoe - Namida no Sotsugyōshiki Shuppatsu ()  Television  On television, most of Yamaguchi's appearances were in a series of dramas with Ken Utsui. Each of these dramas went on for about twenty-six episodes, or half a year. Starting with Kao de waratte and going on to the so-called Akai Series, in each serial drama she and Utsui played a different father and daughter. Echoing Yamaguchi's real-life family issues, all of the Akai series consisted of complex, melodramatic family circumstances such as hidden adoption (Akai Meiro, Akai Giwaku, Akai Kizuna), mistaken identity (Akai Unmei), murder (Akai Meiro, Akai Unmei) or illness (leukemia via radiation poisoning in Akai Giwaku, paralysis via an accidental shooting in Akai Shogeki). Some of the serial dramas in the Akai series did not feature Yamaguchi, such as Akai Gekiryu starring Yutaka Mizutani, in which she made a guest appearance in the first episode. Each of the Akai series which she appeared in, except Akai Meiro, featured a title song sung by Yamaguchi herself. The final Akai program, Akai Shisen, was a two-part story starring her and Tomokazu Miura based on Deadline at Dawn, a novel by William Irish whose Japanese title is Akatsuki no shisen (). For the first time Ken Utsui appeared in it not as the father of Yamaguchi's character, but instead in a small part as a carjacking victim and pilot. It also featured cameos from Rentarō Mikuni and Gin Maeda who had starred in Akai Unmei. * Kao de Waratte () * Ginga Terebi Shōsetsu Akari no Urumu Koro () – Three episodes of a long-running NHK series * Akai Meiro () * Akai Giwaku () Theme song Arigato, Anata * Akai Unmei () Theme song Akai Unmei * Nogiku No Haka () (1977) based on a story of Itō Sachio * Akai Shōgeki () Theme songs Akai Shogeki and Hashire, Kaze To Tomo Ni * Akai Kizuna () Theme song Akai Kizuna (Reddo Senseshon) (red sensation) * Hito wa Sore wo Sukyandaru to Iu () * Yamaguchi Momoe Intai Kinen Supesharu Dorama \\"Akai Shisen\\" ()  See also  * Notes on lyrics of \\"Hito Natsu no Keiken\\" from Japanese Wikipedia. * Akai series, from Japanese Wikipedia. * List of best- selling music artists in Japan Notes References  External links   Category:1959 births Category:Living people Category:Actresses from Tokyo Category:Musicians from Shibuya Category:Japanese female pop singers Category:Japanese idols Category:20th-century Japanese actresses ","title":"Momoe Yamaguchi"},{"id":"1891204","text":"Moz may refer to: Places *Porto de Moz, municipality in the state of Pará in the Northern region of Brazil People *Maurice (given name), as a nickname *Morris (given name), as a nickname Marketing *Moz the Monster, 2017's John Lewis Christmas advert Entertainment *Moz & Cat, 2009 Malayalam psychological comedy drama film * Moz, a musical project of American musician/composer James Brand Abbreviations and acronyms * MOZ Mozambique * MOZ Moorea Airport (IATA code), in Moorea, French Polynesia * p-Methoxybenzyl carbonyl ","title":"Moz"},{"id":"1891208","text":"EA Mobile Inc. is an American video game development studio of the publisher Electronic Arts (EA) for mobile platforms.

As a publishing company in the wireless video game industry, EA Mobile's primary service is linking game developers, who generally develop the games from idea to playable software, with wireless telecommunications service providers or \\"carriers\\", who sell the games to their customers. To this end, they maintain strong relationships with major companies in both groups. In addition, they create, purchase, and maintain proprietary software libraries to aid developers with whom they have working relationships, a common practice among electronic game publishers. They also do the majority of the work regarding quality assurance for their games. History=Foundation EA Mobile was founded in 2004 by a group of EA company veterans. The group was formed/led by John Batter (General Manager) and included Linda Chaplin (head of US sales), Lincoln Wallen (CTO), John Burn (head of European sales), Jay Miller (US sales) and Mike McCabe (head of Asian sales). EA Mobile launched the division and products simultaneously in the US, Europe and Asia. JAMDAT aqcuisition In 2006, EA Mobile expanded its footprint by acquiring JAMDAT Mobile. JAMDAT was founded by Scott Lahman and Zack Norman, two ex-Activision executives, and Austin Murray in March 2000. They were joined in November of that year by Mitch Lasky, who had also worked at Activision, who became the CEO of JAMDAT. JAMDAT went public in late 2003 and gained immediate success after the release of several The Lord of the Rings tie-in mobile games. On December 9, 2005, it was announced that JAMDAT was going to be purchased by Electronic Arts for US$680 million. The acquisition occurred on February 14, 2006, and the JAMDAT name was retired. As of November 21, 2006, the Sepulveda Center or Jamdat building (Visible from the 405 Freeway in West Los Angeles), sign has been removed from both sides of the building. KBS Realty purchased the property in June 2006, and will become the anchor tenant. As of December 8, 2006, EA Mobile LA has been relocated to the EA Los Angeles building in Playa Vista, Los Angeles, California. The same merger of offices happened in Montreal, where Jamdat Montreal moved from its Old-Montreal location to new offices one floor above EA Montreal's studios located in Place Ville-Marie (Downtown Montreal). Further expansion On August 8, 2007, it was announced that Barry Cottle will join EA Mobile as the new Senior Vice President and General Manager. In October 2010, EA Mobile announced the acquisition of UK based iPhone and iPad games publisher 'Chillingo' for US$20 million in cash. While Chillingo publishes the popular Cut the Rope game, the deal did not include those properties. In July 2015, Samantha Ryan became the new SVP and General Manager of EA Mobile replacing Frank Gibeau. And the following year in a restructuring across parent company, EA, she also added oversight of Maxis, and BioWare. As of 2017, EA Mobile have an annual revenue topping almost $700 million and employees around 800 people. Controversy=Rock Band On May 2, 2012, Rock Band on iOS informed users that the game would no longer be playable after May 31, 2012. While EA Mobile have previously pulled games from the App Store such as The Simpsons: Tapped Out, they had either remained playable for anyone who had downloaded it or been free-to-play. Further adding to the controversy was that the app was still being sold on the App Store for its full price with no warning to customers after this message was going out.

He is best known as the leader of the Homestake experiment in the 1960s-1980s, which was the first experiment to detect neutrinos emitted from the Sun; for this he shared the 2002 Nobel Prize in Physics. Early life and education Davis was born in Washington, D.C., where his father was a photographer for the National Bureau of Standards. He spent several years as a choirboy to please his mother, although he could not carry a tune. He enjoyed attending the concerts at the Watergate before air traffic was loud enough to drown out the music. His brother Warren, 14 months younger than he, was his constant companion in boyhood. He received his B.S. from the University of Maryland in 1938 in chemistry, which is part of the University of Maryland College of Computer, Mathematical, and Natural Sciences. He also received a master's degree from that school and a Ph.D. from Yale University in physical chemistry in 1942. Career Davis spent most of the war years at Dugway Proving Ground, Utah observing the results of chemical weapons tests and exploring the Great Salt Lake basin for evidence of its predecessor, Lake Bonneville. Upon his discharge from the army in 1946, Davis went to work at Monsanto's Mound Laboratory, in Miamisburg, Ohio, doing applied radiochemistry of interest to the United States Atomic Energy Commission. In 1948, he joined Brookhaven National Laboratory, which was dedicated to finding peaceful uses for nuclear power. Davis reports that he was asked \\"to find something interesting to work on,\\" and dedicated his career to the study of neutrinos, particles which had been predicted to explain the process of beta decay, but whose separate existence had not been confirmed. Davis investigated the detection of neutrinos by beta decay, the process by which a neutrino brings enough energy to a nucleus to make certain stable isotopes into radioactive ones. Since the rate for this process is very low, the number of radioactive atoms created in neutrino experiments is very small, and Davis began investigating the rates of processes other than beta decay that would mimic the signal of neutrinos. Using barrels and tanks of carbon tetrachloride as detectors, Davis characterized the rate of the production of argon-37 as a function of altitude and as a function of depth underground. He deployed a detector containing chlorine atoms at the Brookhaven Reactor in 1954 and later one of the reactors at Savannah River. These experiments failed to detect a surplus of radioactive argon when the reactors were operating over when the reactors were shut down, and this was taken as the first experimental evidence that neutrinos causing the chlorine reaction, and antineutrinos produced in reactors, were distinct. Detecting neutrinos proved considerably more difficult than not detecting antineutrinos. Davis was the lead scientist behind the Homestake Experiment, the large-scale radiochemical neutrino detector which first detected evidence of neutrinos from the sun. He shared the Nobel Prize in Physics in 2002 with Japanese physicist Masatoshi Koshiba and Italian Riccardo Giacconi for pioneering contributions to astrophysics, in particular for the detection of cosmic neutrinos, looking at the solar neutrino problem in the Homestake Experiment. He was 88 years old when awarded the prize. Personal life Davis met his wife Anna Torrey at Brookhaven and together they built a 21-foot wooden sailboat, the Halcyon. They had five children and lived in the same house in Blue Point, New York for over 50 years. He died in Blue Point, New York from Alzheimer's Disease.

Cycles Follis built a range of bicycles, but was particularly well known for its tandems and racings. During the 1940s and 1950s, he received many patents, mostly on brakes and drivetrain components. In the 1940s and 1950s Follis had teams and individual racers competing for him in his own name, most notably Jean Forestier, who won numerous races and three stages of the Tour de France in 1954-1957, finishing 4th overall in 1957 and winning the green jersey. In 1973, the granddaughter of the founder Joseph Follis, Myriam, took over. She was married to the former employee Jean-Claude Chollet, and they ran the business until its closure in 2007. The entire production of this period were hand-crafted, made to measure steel frames and forks. Consequently, there was no serial production. Customers could determine if they preferred lugs or fillet brazed frames as well as practically any other detail. This included part specifications and paint, and only complete bicycles were sold. Many tandems and racing bicycles were made for and branded by the financing, sometimes competing companies. The company celebrated its 100th birthday in 2003 by offering 100 bicycles numbered on the steerer tube badge. The company is no longer in business, as the couple retired in the summer of 2007.

It was designed so it could cross churned-up countryside and trenches. A single prototype was built, and followed by an improved model (the TOG 2), but interest faded with the successful performance of another cross-country design, the Churchill tank, and the mobile war that was being fought. History In July 1939, the Special Vehicle Development Committee was drawn up for future tank designs suitable for Great War conditions under Sir Albert Gerald Stern; who had been on the original Landship Committee and head of the Tank Supply Depot during World War I. The committee included others who had been instrumental in the development of the tank during the Great War: former Director of Naval Construction, Sir Eustace Tennyson d'Eyncourt, General (retired) Sir Ernest Swinton, engine designer Harry Ricardo, the gearbox and transmission expert Major Walter Gordon Wilson. Unsurprisingly they got the nickname \\"The Old Gang\\" and the initials TOG were applied to their designs. Together, they proposed the development of a heavy tank design, which they entrusted to another of the first tank's developers and builder of the first tank, Sir William Tritton of Foster's of Lincoln. Their specification was comprehensive. As well as being able to operate across ground broken up by shelling and waterlogged, it was expected to resist 47-mm anti-tank guns and 105-mm field guns or howitzers at . Main armament would be a field gun mounted in the front - effective against thick reinforced concrete - and two 2-pounder guns, the latter in sponsons. For use against infantry, there would be Besa machine guns covering \\"all arcs\\" \\\\- one firing forward, one in each sponson, and one firing to the rear. The design was later revised with smaller sponsons containing only the Besa machine guns. To provide cover four smoke mortars were included.White, p66 Design work by Fosters began in December 1939, resulting in a wooden mock-up. Designed with trench crossing abilities to the fore and the capability to carry infantry as well, the design as built was a large hull with side doors supported on broad tracks, with a 2-pdr-gun-armed Matilda II infantry tank turret. The front plate of the hull carried the 75 mm gun and mounting as used on the French Char B1 tank. .Chamberlain and Ellis p78Neither of the planned sponson designs was ever actually installed on the prototype hull It was realised that running the track drive over the top of the hull was not necessary and work began on a follow-up design in June 1940. The prototype TOG I was delivered in October 1940. Due to the weight, electrical drive was used - the engine driving two generators connected to an electrical motor for each track. The steering wheel was connected to a potentiometer that varied the voltage to the track motors. This strained the drive and track. Due to these problems, it was converted to a hydraulic drive designed by Fluidrive Engineering, a process that took until May 1943 after which it was called TOG 1A. The fluid drive was not satisfactory either. The prototype was sent to Chobham and then seems to have disappeared into history.

Ekman is now a Catholic. Ekman is married to Birgitta Ekman and has 4 sons, Aron, Jonathan, Samuel and Benjamin. Ministry In his youth, Ekman was a left-leaning atheist and sympathiser of Swedish Communist party KFML(r) before becoming a Christian, just before graduating from high school in 1970. He studied ethnography, history and theology at Uppsala University and in January 1979 was ordained in the Church of Sweden, returning to Uppsala University to work as the chaplain for several years. He studied for a year at Rhema Bible Training Center in Tulsa, Oklahoma, United States and upon his return to Uppsala in 1983 founded the Charismatic Evangelist church Livets Ord. He remained pastor of the church until passing on the pastorship to Robert Ekh in 2002 to focus on international work, though he later took up the position again. He also founded Livets Ord University and Word of Life Bible School. Through his church he has sent missionaries to Bangladesh, Russia, Ukraine, Armenia, Azerbaijan, Tajikistan, Afghanistan, Albania, Israel and India. Word of Life is also the host for the annual Christian event \\"Europe Conference.\\" In the former USSR he started to preach in pentecostal churches and in stadiums. In Riga, Latvia he worked closely with Aleksej Ledyaev and the \\"New Generation Church\\" where he is a pastor. In almost every big city of the former USSR a Word of Life Church and a New Generation Church was established. The number of people reached with the Gospel can be estimated to be between 250,000–500,000 people. Cooperation with New Generation Church ended in March 2004 in doctrinal disagreement. In the charismatic world, Ulf Ekman is considered to be a mentor, a spiritual father, and a pastor of pastors. Reverend Kong Hee has once claimed Ulf Ekman to be one of his mentors, and over the years they have developed a close relationship.  Conversion  During his Sunday service on 3 March 2013, Ekman informed the assembly of a major change – he, its founder and its pastor for 30 years, would resign in May and be succeeded by Joakim Lundqvist, the up–to–then youth pastor of the congregation.http://ulfekman.org/default.aspx?idStructure=8758 On 9 March 2014, Ekman announced his and his wife's leaving Livets Ord with the intent of joining the Catholic Church. The couple described the split as mainly amicable, and Ekman explained their decision in a lengthy sermon, claiming Jesus’ appeal, in 1 Corinthians 1:10, for unity among Christians, as well as growing and more enthusiastic theological closeness to Catholic doctrine - including during a lengthy stay in Israel, where the couple took up residence in the early 2000s - as the main reasons. Earlier harsh condemnation of the Catholic Church made the decision controversial both among the Christian community and in national debate, where Ekman’s firebrand image had been debated for decades.\\"Därför lämnar jag Livets Ord och blir katolik\\" He indicated, that he received a confirming word of prophecy ahead of his decision from a pastor that just had attended Kenneth Copeland's Charismatic Evangelical Leadership Conference in February 2014,Ulf Ekman says Prophetic Word Confirmed his Catholic Conversion a Conference to which Pope Francis sent a video message through Tony Palmer urging for the protest of the Reformation to come to an end. Theology Like many new Christian movements, Word of Life has been criticized by other Christians, but in particular by the media. Many critics claim that Word of Life's teachings about health and economic abundance created a survival of the fittest attitude, in opposition to the Christian ascetic ideal of being poor and humble. Ekman and Word of Life always responded to this criticism by saying that they strongly believed in God's promises in the Bible. Ekman claimed that a false image was created in the Swedish media on Word of Life as being against, for example, disabled persons, when the outspoken message was that God promises deliverance from sickness. Ekman's theology, along with other representatives of the Word of Faith movement, was criticized for having gnostic elements. A thesis written by Kent Gunnarsson at Umeå University, published in 2004, had this claim.Den kristna gnosticismens återkomst, Kent Gunnarsson. . Full text available (as of 2019-09-21) at http://umu.diva- portal.org/smash/get/diva2:142960/FULLTEXT01.pdf The opponent at the dissertation, Professor Alexander Radler, criticized Gunnarsson for a too-wide definition of Gnosticism. Radler appreciated Gunnarsson's thesis for its rich information about modern Gnosticism, but thought that Ekman's teachings could not be seen as gnostic. Ekman's own attitude against Gnosticism is negative. Later on, Ekman rarely preached the typical Word of Faith teachings. He partially criticized some of them (for example, the Jesus Died Spiritually doctrine), but also wrote and said that the ground for his preaching was the revelation in the Bible he got from first listening to teachers like Kenneth Copeland and later studying at Kenneth Hagin's school in Tulsa. Ekman seems to have broadened his doctrinal horizons with studies in patristic and church history. He has now an ecumenical approach to other congregations. In 2006 the bishop of the Roman Catholic Diocese of Stockholm, Anders Arborelius, was invited to Word of Life church in Uppsala for a public discussion. Through the Livets Ord University, which is a branch of the Oral Roberts University, Ekman published a theological magazine called Keryx, containing articles from a broad, classical Christian point of view. This magazine had articles from different Christian traditions and excerpts from patristic writings. Keryx But a critical analysis of the Word of Faith movement's own teachings hasn’t been published to this day. In 2014, Ekman and his family converted to Roman Catholicism. He claims that the Catechism of the Catholic Church is \\"the best book he has ever read\\". In his 2015 book Den stora upptäckten. Vår väg till katolska kyrkan he claims that an important factor in his conversion to Catholicism was information about Međugorje in Herzegovina and subsequent visit to the place, where Ulf and Birgitta met with Franciscan Jozo Zovko.Den stora upptäckten: Vår väg till katolska kyrkan av Ulf och Birgitta Ekman, Catholica, pp. 59,66-67.

Originally named Carthay Center, the neighborhood was later re-named after the famed Carthay Circle Theatre. Geography The neighborhood is bounded by Wilshire Boulevard to the north, Olympic Boulevard to the south, and Fairfax Avenue to the east. The neighborhood of South Carthay is located south of Olympic Boulevard. History Originally named Carthay Center, Carthay Circle was developed as an upscale residential district in 1922 by J. Harvey McCarthy, who founded the 136-acre, mainly Spanish Revival, community. No two homes are alike due to the rule that all homes had to be designed individually by an architect, and notable designers such as Irving Gill, Paul Williams and Robert Byrd contributed to the neighborhood. The master plan for Carthay Circle was designed by leading early 20th century architects Aleck Curlett and his partner Claud Beelman (designer of MGM Studios and Downtown LA's Eastern Columbia Building) in conjunction with landscape architects Cook & Hall (Wilbur D. Cook is also noted for creating the master plan for the neighboring city of Beverly Hills). McCarthy named the streets in honor of prominent figures of the California Gold Rush. He also planned the neighborhood around a shopping center. Carthay Circle was one of the first planned communities in Los Angeles, and the first in the city to feature underground utilities. The success of Carthay Circle served as the catalyst for the growth of the entire Mid-City area. The main feature of the neighborhood was the Carthay Circle Theatre, the “Showplace of the Golden West,\\" that opened May 18, 1926 and soon became the focal point of Carthay Center. The theater, site of film premieres including Disney's Snow White and the Seven Dwarfs (their first full-length animated film) and the West Coast premiere of Gone with the Wind, inspired the community to change the name from “Carthay Center” to “Carthay Circle.” The theater was demolished in 1969 to make way for a new office complex, 1 Carthay Plaza, today known as Carthay Campus, designed in the mid-century Brutalist architectural style. A large-scale replica of Carthay Circle Theater opened in 2012 at Disney California Adventure Park in Anaheim, California.

Professional wrestling career=Early career Poling was trained as a wrestler by Larry Sharpe. He debuted in 1990, wrestling on the independent circuit under the ring name \\"Al the Sledgehammer\\". Extreme Championship Wrestling (1994-1996) Poling achieved his greatest national exposure in Eastern Championship Wrestling (ECW) in the mid-1990s. He debuted in ECW as an unnamed \\"handler\\" to Sabu on the January 18, 1994 episode of Eastern Championship Wrestling by defeating Chad Austin. He joined Paul Heyman's Dangerous Alliance stable with Sabu and The Tazmaniac. His gimmick was as an enforcer of the \\"extreme\\" attitude; he was named 911 at The Night the Line Was Crossed on February 5, where he defeated Chad Austin in a rematch. As part of his monstrous persona, he would frequently perform the chokeslam on others with little provocation, which made him quickly popular with the crowd as a fan favorite. He received his first title shot in ECW at When Worlds Collide, where he challenged Mikey Whipwreck for the ECW Television Championship but got disqualified after chokeslamming the referee. He would then enter a rivalry with Mr. Hughes, whom he defeated at Hardcore Heaven. On August 27, at the NWA World Title Tournament, 911 participated in the namesake tournament for the vacant NWA World Heavyweight Championship, where he defeated Doink the Clown in the quarter-final after four chokeslams, before losing to 2 Cold Scorpio in the semi-final. He closed the year by defeating The Pitbulls in a handicap match at Holiday Hell. Poling received the Pro Wrestling Illustrated Rookie of the Year award due to his enormous popularity in ECW for the year 1994. Poling had two big matches in 1995, scoring wins over Ron Simmons at Hostile City Showdown and Jim Steele at Barbed Wire, Hoodies & Chokeslams. At the 1996 House Party event, 911 teamed with Rey Misterio, Jr. to defeat The Eliminators in a tag team match, which would turn out to be his last match in ECW. He got involved in a brawl with Taz after the match and a feud evolved between the two, but it was scrapped as Poling left the promotion by early 1996 after a falling out backstage with Paul Heyman over the former's treatment of the ring crew. World Championship Wrestling (1996-1997) Poling wrestled in World Championship Wrestling (WCW) in 1996 and 1997, under the names Tombstone, Sledge Hammer and Big Al. Poling did not portray the Big Al who feuded with Tank Abbott in WCW in early 2000. Return to ECW In 1998, Poling returned to ECW at UltraClash in Philadelphia, Pennsylvania, chokeslamming Bill Wiles. Poling was then accompanied by manager Judge Jeff Jones, who proclaimed 911 to be the true giant of professional wrestling. They were then interrupted by Spike Dudley and had an impromptu match, which 911 lost in under a minute. Independent circuit Throughout the late 1990s, 911 appeared with the New Jersey based Jersey All Pro Wrestling promotion, winning the JAPW Heavyweight Championship on two occasions. He made an appearance at Pro-Pain Pro Wrestling A War Renewed on June 29, 2002 in Philadelphia, Pennsylvania, interfering on the behalf of Tod Gordon and Sabu, delivering a chokeslam to Sandman (who had just been betrayed by his partner, Bill Alfonso). At Hardcore Homecoming in 2005 he chokeslammed both Danny Doring and Roadkill. He wrestled at New York Wrestling League in 2008. Personal life Poling resides in West Creek, New Jersey and has eight children.

Spatiotemporal gene expression is the activation of genes within specific tissues of an organism at specific times during development. Gene activation patterns vary widely in complexity. Some are straightforward and static, such as the pattern of tubulin, which is expressed in all cells at all times in life. Some, on the other hand, are extraordinarily intricate and difficult to predict and model, with expression fluctuating wildly from minute to minute or from cell to cell. Spatiotemporal variation plays a key role in generating the diversity of cell types found in developed organisms; since the identity of a cell is specified by the collection of genes actively expressed within that cell, if gene expression was uniform spatially and temporally, there could be at most one kind of cell. Consider the gene wingless, a member of the wnt family of genes. In the early embryonic development of the model organism Drosophila melanogaster, or fruit fly, wingless is expressed across almost the entire embryo in alternating stripes three cells separated. This pattern is lost by the time the organism develops into a larva, but wingless is still expressed in a variety of tissues such as the wing imaginal discs, patches of tissue that will develop into the adult wings. The spatiotemporal pattern of wingless gene expression is determined by a network of regulatory interactions consisting of the effects of many different genes such as even-skipped and Krüppel. What causes spatial and temporal differences in the expression of a single gene? Because current expression patterns depend strictly on previous expression patterns, there is a regressive problem of explaining what caused the first differences in gene expression. The process by which uniform gene expression becomes spatially and temporally differential is known as symmetry breaking. For example, in the case of embryonic Drosophila development, the genes nanos and bicoid are asymmetrically expressed in the oocyte because maternal cells deposit messenger RNA (mRNA) for these genes in the poles of the egg before it is laid. The gamma-crystalline promoter drives expression of the green fluorescent protein reporter gene exclusively in the eye of an adult frog. Identifying spatiotemporal patterns One way to identify the expression pattern of a particular gene is to place a reporter gene downstream of its promoter. In this configuration, the promoter gene will cause the reporter gene to be expressed only where and when the gene of interest is expressed. The expression distribution of the reporter gene can be determined by visualizing it. For example, the reporter gene green fluorescent protein can be visualized by stimulating it with blue light and then using a digital camera to record green fluorescent emission. If the promoter of the gene of interest is unknown, there are several ways to identify its spatiotemporal distribution. Immunohistochemistry involves preparing an antibody with specific affinity for the protein associated with the gene of interest. This distribution of this antibody can then be visualized by a technique such as fluorescent labeling. Immunohistochemistry has the advantages of being methodologically feasible and relatively inexpensive. Its disadvantages include non-specificity of the antibody leading to false positive identification of expression. Poor penetrance of the antibody into the target tissue can lead to false negative results. Furthermore, since immunohistochemistry visualizes the protein generated by the gene, if the protein product diffuses between cells, or has a particularly short or long half-life relative to the mRNA that is used to translate the protein, this can lead to distorted interpretation of which cells are expressing the mRNA. In situ hybridizations of genes expressed in arteries (top) and veins (bottom) in zebrafish. Blue staining indicates presence of the gene mRNAs. Panels on the left are normal animals, while animals on the right are mutated in the Notch gene. Fish lacking Notch have fewer arteries and more veins at this point in developmental time. In situ hybridization is an alternate method in which a \\"probe,\\" a synthetic nucleic acid with a sequence complementary to the mRNA of the gene, is added to the tissue. This probe is then chemically tagged so that it can be visualized later. This technique enables visualization specifically of mRNA-producing cells without any of the artifacts associated with immunohistochemistry. However, it is notoriously difficult, and requires knowledge of the sequence of DNA corresponding to the gene of interest. A method called enhancer-trap screening reveals the diversity of spatiotemporal gene expression patterns possible in an organism. In this technique, DNA that encodes a reporter gene is randomly inserted into the genome. Depending on the gene promoters proximal to the insertion point, the reporter gene will be expressed in particular tissues at particular points in development. While enhancer-trap derived expression patterns do not necessarily reflect the actual patterns of expression of specific genes, they reveal the variety of spatiotemporal patterns that are accessible to evolution. Reporter genes can be visualized in living organisms, but both immunohistochemistry and in situ hybridization must be performed in fixed tissues. Techniques that require fixation of tissue can only generate a single temporal time point per individual organism. However, using live animals instead of fixed tissue can be crucial in dynamically understanding expression patterns over an individual's lifespan. Either way, variation between individuals can confound the interpretation of temporal expression patterns. Methods to control spatiotemporal gene expression Several methods are being pursued for controlling gene expression spatially, temporally and in different degrees. One method is by using operon inducer/repressor system which provides temporal control of gene expression. To control gene expression spatially inkjet printers are under development for printing ligands on gel culture. Other popular method involves use of light to control gene expression in spatiotemporal fashion. Since light can also be controlled easily in space, time and degree, several methods of controlling gene expression at DNA and RNA level have been developed and are under study. For example, RNA interference can be controlled using light and also patterning of gene expression has been performed in cell monolayer and in zebrafish embryos using caged morpholino or peptide nucleic acidAlexander Heckel, Günter Mayer, \\"The Chemical Biology of Nucleic Acids\\", Chapter 13.

It was based on the book Expedition, by sci-fi/fantasy artist and writer Wayne Douglas Barlowe, who was also executive producer on the special. It premiered on May 14, 2005. The show uses computer- generated imagery, which is interspersed with interviews from such notables as Stephen Hawking, George Lucas, Michio Kaku and Jack Horner. The show was filmed in Iceland and Mono Lake in California. Plot Alien Planet starts out with an interstellar spacecraft named Von Braun, leaving Earth's orbit. Traveling at 20% the speed of light (37,000 miles/s), it reaches Darwin IV in 42 years. Upon reaching orbit, it deploys the Darwin Reconnaissance Orbiter, which looks for potential landing sites for the probes. The first probe, Balboa, explodes along with its lifting body transport during entry, because one of its wings failed to unfold. Two backup probes, Leonardo da Vinci (nicknamed Leo) and Isaac Newton (nicknamed Ike), successfully land on the planet, and learn much about its bizarre indigenous lifeforms, including an apparently sapient species. The robotic probes sent out to research on Darwin IV are called Horus Probes. Each Horus probe consists of an high, long inflatable, hydrogen-filled balloon, which is covered with solar receptors, a computer 'brain', a 'head' covered with sensors, and several smaller robots that can be sent to places too dangerous for the probes themselves. The probes have a limited degree of artificial intelligence, very similar to the 'processing power' of a 4-year-old. All the real thinking is done by a supercomputer in the orbiting Von Braun. The probes are programmed with different personalities; Ike is more cautious, while Leo is the risk-taker. The two probes are also equipped with a holographic message that will be projected to any sentient life found on Darwin. After the two probes inflate their gas-bags, they encounter a voracious Arrowtongue and watch it pursue a Gyrosprinter. Later that night, the twins find the wreckage of Balboa and are ordered to split up, Ike studying the unique plant life and Leo going after big game. Ike's voyage takes him to one of Darwin IV's pocket forests, where he encounters a flock of Trunk Suckers and their predator, the Daggerwrist. Before his research is finished, a massive hurricane-like storm hits and Ike must take to the sky, launching weather balloons. Leo goes to the mountain ranges and finds a herd of Unths engaged in rutting-like behavior. Afterward, Leo finds a pair of Bladderhorns engaging in combat. It tries to communicate with one, but a sonic ping interrupts the conversation and scares off the animal, and he is knocked out by a mysterious creature. Ike ventures to the meadows and gullies of Darwin IV, encountering massive Grovebacks and a herd of Littoralopes. Flying above, dangerous predators: the Skewers. Leo gets destroyed by a mysterious and evasive creature, and Ike, ordered by the Von Braun to search for Leo's attacker, hopes to find a new sentient species. Ike's route takes him across perilous terrain, and across the Amoebic Sea in its quest for Leo. As it embarks on its journey, one of the Grovebacks seen earlier falls victim to a swarm of Beach Quills. Ike then finds a pack of Prongheads hunting a Gyrosprinter, and crosses the Amoebic Sea (which attempted to attack Ike), encountering a herd of giant Sea Striders. Ike manages to find Leo after a harrowing experience with a Skewer which tries to attack it, but is killed by a spear thrown by the newly discovered floating Eosapien. Shortly afterward, Ike communicates with the Eosapien tribe and discovers that they are truly intelligent. Ike launches a camera disk to record the moment, or perhaps \\"to assess the threat\\" due to a third Eosapien appearing; however one of the Eosapiens mistakes it as an attack and destroys the camera disk. Before shutting down, the wrecked camera disk records the Eosapien tribe carrying Ike away. Commentary from notable people discussing the details behind the fictional world of Darwin IV and the likelihood of extraterrestrial life, in general, is interspersed throughout the movie. Craft The following are the craft and probes that appear in the film: Von Braun The cruise speed of the Von Braun is 20% the speed of light. At this speed, it reaches the planet Darwin IV in 42 years. The Von Braun, named after Wernher von Braun, has two primary propulsion systems: nuclear ion engines for low-speed maneuvers during the first year of spaceflight and an antimatter catalyst to accelerate to 20% the speed of light. Once in orbit it deploys the Darwin Reconnaissance Orbiter and the landing probes. It also has artificial intelligence computers to act as the central command for the mission. During the long cruise to Darwin IV, a metal-composite dust shield protects the spacecraft from interstellar debris. It is jettisoned before Von Braun brakes in orbit around Darwin IV. Finally, it has a diameter communications dish, deployed in orbit, for information transfer to Earth. It transfers a large amount of information via a laser beam at a frequency of 8 GHz in the X-band. Darwin Reconnaissance Orbiter The Darwin Reconnaissance Orbiter (DRO) was deployed in orbit around Darwin IV from the Von Braun. The spacecraft has a mass of about 5,000 kilograms. Unlike the nuclear-powered Von Braun, the DRO utilizes solar panels, capable of generating several megawatts for power. Its primary purpose was to look for potential landing sites for the Horus probes and to map the entire planet. After deployment, the DRO utilizes its own booster rocket to place it in the proper orbit. The DRO studied the planet for about 1 Darwin IV year (about 1.6 Earth years) to ensure the Horus probes would not land in unacceptable conditions. Instruments carried on the DRO include a synthetic aperture radar, a visible light camera, a near-infrared camera, and a spectrometer. The exact timing of the landings would be determined by computers in the Von Braun based on data from the DRO. Horus Probes The Horus probes are used for the surface operations of the Darwin IV expedition. The Von Braun carries three probes. Each probe is essentially identical with the exception of their behavior and external color. Each probe is carried to the surface in a lifting body lander. The probes also have the intelligence on par with a 4-year-old child. =Probe Balboa= Probe Balboa, named after Vasco Núñez de Balboa, was the first probe launched to explore Darwin IV. However, it experienced a malfunction while the two small wings/fins were unfolding. When it entered Darwin IV's atmosphere, non-heat-resistant material that was exposed caught fire, leading to the breakup of the craft. If Probe Balboa's entry into Darwin IV atmosphere is watched carefully, it can be seen that the right wing/fin does not extend and lock into place. Probe Balboa was never given a nickname. It was the shortest lasting probe, since it was never activated. Its color is red. =Probe Da Vinci= Probe Leo, named after Leonardo da Vinci, was the second probe to attempt landing on Darwin IV, which was a success. Leo was programmed to take risks and be adventurous, and study animal life. It explored the planet for several days before it went offline due to an Eosapien attack. It came back online momentarily, launching a camera disk, which disturbed the Eosapiens and provoked them to attack a second time. Leo never came back online. Its color is blue. =Probe Newton= Probe Ike, named after Isaac Newton, was the third and final probe to land. He was programmed to be more observational and avoid risks. His first objective was the study of plant life; but Ike encountered many more creatures in the process. After Leo went offline, the Von Braun commanded probe Newton to search for Leo and to take more risks studying animal life. On the way, Ike traveled some distance and discovered several new aliens. Upon arrival at Leo's final transmission site, Ike was almost killed by a Skewer, but was miraculously saved by an Eosapien's spear. It is unknown if this was simply pure luck, or, as a genuine form of extraterrestrial intelligence, if it willingly saved Ike's life. Ike then showed the Eosapien the Earth communication message. Ike was surrounded by Eosapiens and launched its sixth and last camera disk. The Eosapiens thought the camera disk was a threat and attacked it and possibly Ike, thus terminating surface operations of the mission. If an observer looks carefully, they can see that Ike is last seen being carried away by the Eosapien tribe and is presumed to have been destroyed, although his true fate is still debatable. It was the longest-lasting probe on Darwin IV. Its color is yellow. Mini probes The Horus probes (Leo, Ike, and Balboa) carry mini-probes to venture into places too dangerous or too small for the Horus probes. The spiders and disks can be collected and recharged, while the balloons cannot. =Camera disks= Camera disks are small, flying-saucer like disks that can be launched and fly at high speeds. The disks are equipped with two small cameras to record video. The disks were considered as threats by the Eosapiens (Probably because they see them as throwing weapons) and was the main culprit for the probe's destruction. Leo, Ike, and Balboa each have six of them. Ike constantly launched camera disks to study life-forms. Camera disks 1, 5, and 6 from Ike were destroyed by native life. They were lost to - Daggerwrists (Because it \\"wasn't interested in posing\\"), Sea Striders (One stepped on the disk by accident), and Eosapiens (They mistook it for a threat for some reason, probably seeing it as throwing a weapon). One of Leo's camera disks was destroyed by an Eosapien (Again, because the disk was mistaken for a threat). =Weather balloons= Green weather balloons are used to help Ike, Leo, and Balboa analyze the current weather conditions. They are built with a sensor that tells the Horus probes what is going on. They also have a small camera. Unlike the camera disks and spider probes, the weather balloons are not retrieved for re-use. It is unknown if any of them got destroyed by some force. =Robotic spiders= These robotic spiders are four-legged, and are used to help the Horus probe See also *Natural History of an Alien *Extraterrestrial - similar National Geographic Channel documentary program *The Future Is Wild - documentary series on possible future evolution of life on planet Earth External links  Alien Planet at Discovery Channel, captured by the Wayback Machine Category:Discovery Channel original programming Category:2000s American television specials Category:Documentary films about space Category:2005 television specials Category:Speculative evolution Category:American robot films Category:American films Category:Extraterrestrial life in popular culture ","title":"Alien Planet"},{"id":"1891371","text":"The European Agricultural Guarantee Fund (EAGF) consumes a large part of the general budget of the European Union.

Erik Johan Stagnelius (14 October 17933 April 1823) was a Swedish Romantic poet and playwright. 1810 to 1840 was a time of blossoming in Swedish poetry, and there were several writers of distinguished merit, among them Esaias Tegnér, Erik Gustaf Geijer, Per Daniel Amadeus Atterbom and Stagnelius. The brief and mysterious life and death of Erik Johan Stagnelius have given a romantic interest to all that is connected with his name. Life Stagnelius was born in Gärdslösa, Öland, where his father was a vicar; he was later bishop in Kalmar on the nearby mainland, which probably influenced Stagnelius's spiritual thinking. He came from a large family. Stagnelius showed a natural gift for poetic writing from an early childhood. He took his Bachelor's Degree from Uppsala University in 1814 and got an employment as a clerk in Stockholm. As a person he was said to have been unattractive and unkempt. A woman who knew him, said of his appearance \\"where in this shabby person lies the beauty which his poetry expresses?\\". He was notably gloomy and lived alone for most of his life, although he seemed to flourish during brief visits to his home town. As he first arrived to Stockholm, he strived for success as a poet, but basically this did not come until after his death. His first publication was the epic of Wladimir den store ('Vladimir the Great'; 1817); followed by the romantic poem Blenda. His singular dramas, Bacchanterna ('The Bacchantes'; 1822), Sigurd Ring, which was posthumous, and Martyrerna ('The Martyrs'; 1821), are esteemed by many critics to be his most original productions. His mystical lyrics, entitled Liljor i Saron ('Lilies in Sharon'; 1820), and his sonnets, which are best read in Swedish, may be recommended as among the most delicate products of the Scandinavian mind. It is believed that he suffered a chronic physical condition (a side effect of his alleged intense alcohol consumption or possibly Noonan syndrome have been suggested by Swedish researchers) causing him increasing pain, and that he used opium as his main remedy. On the details of his life, little is known. He had only a few friends, and no female companionship. Following his death in Stockholm at the age of 29, no relatives were present at the funeral. Poetry Stagnelius has been compared, and not improperly, to Shelley. Several of Stagnelius poems were translated into English by Edmund Gosse (1886). The bulk of his poetry was found in a sack in his shabby apartment after his death. They were almost sent to be burnt, but were instead kept, and several are still appreciated today for their romantic and mystic/spiritual qualities. Perhaps the best known are the poem \\"Näcken,\\" a romantic verse-based poem about the Nix; Till förruttnelsen ('For Decay') and Resa, Amanda, jag skall ('Travel, Amanda, I shall') Philosophy His thinking, which is evident from his later works, is influenced by mystics and romantic philosophers. He was also partly influenced by gnostic beliefs. Not proper, perhaps, in the Christian 19th century Sweden, this possible belief has been thoroughly examined, and is believed to have originated by a reading of the Swedish translation of Ginza Rba, the holy works of the Mandaeism, published as Adam's Book. Other persons whose works he read and were likely influences were Schelling, Jakob Böhme and Plato.

History The symmetrical bridge as seen from the Douro River In March 1952, a preliminary project for a roadway bridge was adjudicated to Professor Edgar António Mesquita Cardoso, by the JAE. It was approved in 1955. The construction of the bridge proceeded in May 1957. By decree 42/234, dated 22 April 1959, the Ministério das Obras Públicas (Public Works Ministry) promoted, through their respective City Councils, the construction of modest dwellings for the accommodation of families who needed to be demolished, as a result of the construction of access to the bridge. By 22 June 1963, the bridge was concluded and inaugurated. At the time of its completion, the bridge's main span of was the largest of any concrete-arch bridge in the world. In the 1990s, the elevators on the bridge were deactivated. A process to classify the bridge began on 16 February 2011. An announcement was issued on 18 September 2012 (13409/2012) on the project to classify the bridge as a Monumento Nacional (National Monument), establishing its respective Special protection Zone.

Architecture A look at one of the bronze statues on the larger pillars The bridge is isolated over the Douro river, supported over the northern margin along the Arrábida escarpment and along the southern margin at ravine in the area of Candal. It is implanted downstream from the D. Luís Bridge, and is the closest to the mouth of the Douro River, establishing a connection between the IC1 (in Vila Nova de Gaia) and Porto beltway (VCI). The structure is an iron, archway bridge, constructed of reinforced concrete, asphalt deck. The deck is supported by a dual archway, united by corner narrow elements in concrete crosses. There are 76 pillars, with the largest four located near the main supports, near the massive rectangular columns, with smaller pillars regularly spaced along the exterior surfaces. These larger columns have elevators that link the deck level to the marginal roadway along the Douro. The elevator volumes, facing the interior of the bridge, include addorsed sculptures. The deck includes six lines of traffic for vehicular traffic (part of the European route E01 system) and two narrower lines for pedestrian passage. The total length of the deck is with a width of The arch has a rise of , and the maximum clearance above river level is above the Douro. The cost of construction was 126 million escudos.

The Pratihara kings, predominantly the worshipers of Lord Shiva were great builders and architecturally brilliant. They were ardent patrons of art and sculpture. The Trinetreshwar temple is an ornate and evolved example of its time portraying the Gurjjar Pratihar style. Owing to the reign of the Pratihar kings, the regions were later called as the Panchal region. The temple was later reconstructed without changing its architectural beauty by the King of Lakthar, Karansinghji in memory of his son. The Tarnetar temple is surrounded by three Kunds : the Vishnu Kund, the Bhrahma Kund and the Shiv Kund - south of which a cellar is built. It is popularly believed that a dip in its waters is as holy as a dip in the sacred River Ganges.

He is known for winning the first series of Big Brother in 2000. He is trained as a bricklayer, and has appeared in numerous television series related to building since winning Big Brother. Craig’s last TV appearance was in Stars in Their Eyes as Tom Jones.  Life and career  The younger of two children, his family moved to Newport, Shropshire in the late 1980s. At 18, Phillips secured a day release bricklayers apprenticeship whilst employed with Wrekin Council's construction department. He also attended further night school classes in advanced brickwork and civil engineering. Having qualified with a City & Guilds, Phillips went on to set up his own building company. In the 1990s, he presented Renovation Street with Linda Robson for Carlton ITV before being brought in as the DIY expert for the BBC on an exclusive contract in 2001. After leaving Big Brother as the first winner, Phillips announced he was giving his £70,000 prize fund to his friend Joanne Harris, who had Down syndrome, to pay for her heart and lung transplant. He had begun raising money with friends for Harris sometime before entering Big Brother, raising only small amounts of money towards the £250,000 needed for her operation, but within 6 days of winning, he achieved the target required for her life saving operation thanks to public support and donations from celebrities. Harris died in April 2008. He has featured in comedy series Bo' Selecta! and appeared in the reality series Back To Reality, raising £40,000 for Macmillan Cancer Trust. At Christmas 2000, Phillips released the charity single, \\"At This Time of Year\\" through Warner Music. The single went to Number 14 in the UK Singles Chart, achieving silver disc status, and raising over £40,000 for the Down's Syndrome Association. It stayed in the top 40 for three weeks. Since then, he appeared in videos for two other Xmas singles – \\"Bo Selectas! Proper Crimbo\\" which reached No. 4 in 2003 and Ricky Tomlinson's \\"Xmas My A*se\\" which reached 25 in 2006. In 2001, Phillips appeared on Lily Savage's Blankety Blank; in 2003, Phillips appeared on the fifth series of Fort Boyard. Phillips has presented numerous televisions programmes, including Housecall, Housecall in the Country, Builders Sweat and Tears, Our House, Trading Up, Big Strong Boys, Boyz in the Wood, Big Strong Boys in the Sun, Renovation Street, Trading Up in the Sun, House Trap and Craig’s Trade Tips. He also has a production company called Avent Productions. For Avent, he has presented Conversion; a 10-part series for Discovery Realtime, and the sixth series of Hung, Drawn & Broke, a 6-part series filmed for British Forces Broadcasting Service. The company also produces corporate productions many of these for building companies. In 2007, Phillips joined the team of 60 Minute Makeover for ITV. He appeared in 80 episodes in 2008. In February 2009, Phillips appeared in Ant & Dec's Saturday Night Takeaway in \\"Escape from Takeaway Prison\\" for six weeks. In summer 2009, he released his debut autobiography. In July 2009, Phillips returned to the Big Brother house to help celebrate the show's tenth anniversary. In 2010, Phillips appeared on Big Brother again, and competed in a shed building task. He also appeared in Dermot's Last Supper, a special to celebrate the ending of Big Brother. In April 2011, he hosted a show called Celebrity DIY with Craig Phillips for Home. In June 2011, he also hosted If It's Broke, Fit It for Home. In 2018, Phillips married Laura Sherriff, after the couple had dated for two years. Rather than asking for gifts from guests, he and Sherriff asked that the attendants donate to hospice charities instead. In 2019, he announced that he had a child with Sherriff, and later confirmed he is set to have another child in 2020. In June 2020, he made a guest appearance on Big Brothers's Best Shows on E4, where he talked about watching his series back.

Although most Quechua speakers are native to the country of origin, there are some significant populations living in Ecuador, Bolivia, Chile, Colombia and Argentina. The most common Quechua dialect is Southern Quechua. The Kichwa people of Ecuador speak the Kichwa dialect; in Colombia, the Inga people speak Inga Kichwa. The Quechua word for a Quechua speaker is runa or nuna (\\"person\\"); the plural is runakuna or nunakuna (\\"people\\"). \\"Quechua speakers call themselves Runa -- simply translated, 'the people.'\\"https://www.frommers.com/destinations/peru/in-depth/language Some historical Quechua people are: * The Chanka people, who lived in the Huancavelica, Ayacucho, and Apurímac regions of Peru. * The Huanca people of the Junín Region of Peru, who spoke Quechua before the Incas did. * The Inca, who established the largest empire of the pre-Columbian era. * The Chincha, an extinct merchant kingdom of the Ica Region of Peru. * The Qolla who inhabited the Potosi Potosi, Oruro, and La Paz departments of Bolivia. * The Cañari of Ecuador, who adopted the Quechua language from the Inca. Historical and sociopolitical background The speakers of Quechua, who total some 4.4 million people in Peru, 1.6 million in Bolivia, 2.2 million in Ecuador (Hornberger and King, 2001), and according to Ethnologue (2006) 8,200 in Chile, 60,000 in Argentina, and a few hundred in Brazil, have an only slight sense of common identity. The various Quechua dialects are in some cases so different that no mutual understanding is possible. Quechua was not only spoken by the Incas, but also by their long-term enemies of the Inca Empire, like the Huanca (Wanka is a Quechua dialect spoken today in the Huancayo area) and the Chanka (the Chanca dialect of Ayacucho) of Peru, and the Kañari (Cañari) in Ecuador. Quechua was spoken by some of these people, for example, the Wanka, before the Incas of Cusco, while other people, especially in Bolivia but also in Ecuador, adopted Quechua only in Inca times or afterward. Quechua became Peru's second official language in 1969 under the infamous dictatorship of Juan Velasco Alvarado. Recently there have been tendencies toward nation building among Quechua speakers, particularly in Ecuador (Kichwa) but also in Bolivia, where there are only slight linguistic differences from the original Peruvian version. An indication of this effort is the umbrella organization of the Kichwa peoples in Ecuador, ECUARUNARI (Ecuador Runakunapak Rikcharimuy). Some Christian organizations also refer to a \\"Quechua people\\", such as the Christian shortwave radio station HCJB, \\"The Voice of the Andes\\" (La Voz de los Andes).CUNAN CRISTO JESUS BENDICIAN HCJB: \\"El Pueblo Quichua\\". The term \\"Quechua Nation\\" occurs in such contexts as the name of the Education Council of the Quechua Nation (Consejo Educativo de la Nación Quechua, CENAQ), which is responsible for Quechua instruction or bilingual intercultural schools in the Quechua-speaking regions of Bolivia. Some Quechua speakers claim that if nation states in Latin America had been built following the European pattern, they should be a single, independent nation. Material culture and social history Quechua woman with llamas (Cusco Department, Peru) Despite their ethnic diversity and linguistic distinctions, the various Quechua ethnic groups have numerous cultural characteristics in common. They also share many of these with the Aymara, or other indigenous peoples of the central Andes. Traditionally, Quechua identity is locally oriented and inseparably linked in each case with the established economic system. It is based on agriculture in the lower altitude regions, and on pastoral farming in the higher regions of the Puna. The typical Andean community extends over several altitude ranges and thus includes the cultivation of a variety of arable crops and/or livestock. The land is usually owned by the local community (ayllu) and is either cultivated jointly or redistributed annually. Beginning with the colonial era and intensifying after the South American states had gained their independence, large landowners appropriated all or most of the land and forced the native population into bondage (known in Ecuador as Huasipungo, from Kichwa wasipunku, \\"front door\\"). Harsh conditions of exploitation repeatedly led to revolts by the indigenous farmers, which were forcibly suppressed. The largest of these revolts occurred 1780–1781 under the leadership of José Gabriel Kunturkanki. Some indigenous farmers re-occupied their ancestors' lands and expelled the landlords during the takeover of governments by infamous dictatorships in the middle of the 20th century, such as in 1952 in Bolivia (Víctor Paz Estenssoro) and 1968 in Peru (Juan Velasco Alvarado). The agrarian reforms included the illegal expropriation of large landowners. In Bolivia there was a redistribution of the land to the indigenous population as their private property. This disrupted traditional Quechua and Aymara culture based on communal ownership, but ayllus have been retained up to the present time in remote regions, such as in the Peruvian Quechua community of Q'ero. Quechua woman with children The struggle for land rights continues up to the present time to be a political focal point of everyday Quechua life. The Kichwa ethnic groups of Ecuador which are part of the ECUARUNARI association were recently able to regain communal land titles or the return of estates—in some cases through militant activity. Especially the case of the community of Sarayaku has become well known among the Kichwa of the lowlands, who after years of struggle were able to successfully resist expropriation and exploitation of the rain forest for petroleum recovery. A distinction is made between two primary types of joint work. In the case of mink'a, people work together for projects of common interest (such as the construction of communal facilities). Ayni is, in contrast, reciprocal assistance, whereby members of an ayllu help a family to accomplish a large private project, for example house construction, and in turn can expect to be similarly helped later with a project of their own. In almost all Quechua ethnic groups, many traditional handicrafts are an important aspect of material culture. This includes a tradition of weaving handed down from Inca times or earlier, using cotton, wool (from llamas, alpacas, guanacos, vicunas) and a multitude of natural dyes, and incorporating numerous woven patterns (pallay). Houses are usually constructed using air- dried clay bricks (tika, or in Spanish adobe), or branches and clay mortar (“wattle and daub”), with the roofs being covered with straw, reeds, or puna grass (ichu). The disintegration of the traditional economy, for example, regionally through mining activities and accompanying proletarian social structures, has usually led to a loss of both ethnic identity and the Quechua language. This is also a result of steady migration to large cities (especially to Lima), which has resulted in acculturation by Hispanic society there. Foods and crops Quechua peoples cultivate and eat a variety of foods. They domesticated potatoes and cultivate thousands of potato varieties, which are used for food and medicine. Climate change is threatening their potato and other traditional crops but they are undertaking conservation and adaptation efforts. Quinoa is another staple crop grown by Quechua peoples. Ch’arki (the origin of the English word jerky) is a Quechua dried (and sometimes salted) meat. It was traditionally made from llama meat that was sun- and freeze-dried in the Andean sun and cold nights, but is now also often made from horse and beef, with variation among countries. Pachamanca, a Quechua word for a pit cooking technique used in Peru, includes several types of meat such as chicken, beef, pork, lamb, and/or mutton; tubers such as potatoes, sweet potatoes, yucca, uqa/ok’a (oca in Spanish), and mashwa; other vegetables such as maize/corn and fava beans; seasonings; and sometimes cheese in a small pot and/or tamales. Guinea pigs are also sometimes raised for meat. Other foods and crops include the meat of Llamas and Alpacas as well as beans, barley, hot peppers, coriander, and peanuts. Examples of recent persecution of Quechuas Hilaria Supa, human rights activist and Peruvian politician Up to the present time Quechuas continue to be victims of political conflicts and ethnic persecution. In the Peruvian civil war of the 1980s between the government and Sendero Luminoso about three-quarters of the estimated 70,000 death toll were Quechuas, whereas the war parties were without exception whites and mestizos (people with mixed descent from both natives and Spaniards).Orin Starn: Villagers at Arms: War and Counterrevolution in the Central-South Andes. In Steve Stern (ed.): Shining and Other Paths: War and Society in Peru, 1980–1995. Duke University Press, Durham und London, 1998, The forced sterilization policy under Alberto Fujimori affected almost exclusively Quechua and Aymara women, a total exceeding 200,000. The Bolivian film director Jorge Sanjines dealt with the issue of forced sterilization in 1969 in his Quechua-language feature film Yawar Mallku. Perceived ethnic discrimination continues to play a role at the parliamentary level. When the newly elected Peruvian members of parliament Hilaria Supa Huamán and María Sumire swore their oath of office in Quechua—for the first time in the history of Peru in an indigenous language—the Peruvian parliamentary president Martha Hildebrandt and the parliamentary officer Carlos Torres Caro refused their acceptance. Mythology Practically all Quechuas in the Andes have been nominally Roman Catholic since colonial times. Nevertheless, traditional religious forms persist in many regions, blended with Christian elements - a fully integrated Syncretism. Quechua ethnic groups also share traditional religions with other Andean peoples, particularly belief in Mother Earth (Pachamama), who grants fertility and to whom burnt offerings and libations are regularly made. Also important are the mountain spirits (apu) as well as lesser local deities (wak'a), who are still venerated especially in southern Peru. The Quechuas came to terms with their repeated historical experience of tragedy in the form of various myths. These include the figure of Nak'aq or Pishtaco (\\"butcher\\"), the white murderer who sucks out the fat from the bodies of the indigenous peoples he kills,Examples (Ancash Quechua with Spanish translation) at and (in Chanka Quechua) and a song about a bloody river.Karneval von Tambobamba.

Reclam, Leipzig 1976, p. 172 In their myth of Wiraquchapampa,Thomas Müller and Helga Müller-Herbon: Die Kinder der Mitte. Die Q'ero-Indianer. Lamuv Verlag, Göttingen 1993, the Q'ero people describe the victory of the Apus over the Spaniards. Of the myths still alive today, the Inkarrí myth common in southern Peru is especially interesting; it forms a cultural element linking the Quechua groups throughout the region from Ayacucho to Cusco.Juliane Bambula Diaz und Mario Razzeto: Ketschua-Lyrik. Reclam, Leipzig 1976, pp. 231 ff. Some Quechua people consider classic products of the region - such as the Corn beer Chicha, Coca leaves and local potatoes as having a religious significance, but this belief is not uniform across communities. Contribution in modern medicine Quinine, which is found naturally in bark of cinchona tree, is known to be used by Quechuas people for malaria-like symptoms. When chewed, coca acts as a mild stimulant and suppresses hunger, thirst, pain, and fatigue; it is also used to alleviate altitude sickness. Coca leaves are chewed during work in the fields as well as during breaks in construction projects in Quechua provinces. Coca leaves are the raw material from which cocaine, one of Peru's most historically important exports, is chemically extracted. Traditional clothing Quechua woman and child in the Sacred Valley, Peru Many indigenous women wear the colorful traditional attire, complete with bowler style hat. The hat has been worn by Quechua and Aymara women since the 1920s, when it was brought to the country by British railway workers. They are still commonly worn today. The traditional dress worn by Quechua women today is a mixture of styles from Pre- Spanish days and Spanish Colonial peasant dress. Starting at puberty, Quechua girls begin wearing multiple layers of petticoats and skirts; the more petticoats and skirts worn by a young woman, the more desirable a bride she would be, due to her family's wealth (represented by the number of petticoats and skirts). Married women also wear multiple layers of petticoats and skirts. Younger Quechua men generally wear Western-style clothing, the most popular being synthetic football shirts and tracksuit pants. In certain regions, women also generally wear Western-style clothing. Older men still wear dark wool knee-length handwoven bayeta pants. A woven belt called a chumpi is also worn which provides protection to the lower back when working in the fields. Men's fine dress includes a woollen waistcoat, similar to a sleeveless juyuna as worn by the women but referred to as a chaleco. Chalecos can be richly decorated. The most distinctive part of men's clothing is the handwoven poncho. Nearly every Quechua man and boy has a poncho, generally red in colour decorated with intricate designs. Each district has a distinctive pattern. In some communities such as Huilloc, Patacancha, and many villages in the Lares Valley ponchos are worn as daily attire. However most men use their ponchos on special occasions such as festivals, village meetings, weddings etc. As with the women, ajotas, sandals made from recycled tyres, are the standard footwear. They are cheap and durable. A ch'ullu is frequently worn. This is a knitted hat with earflaps. The first ch'ullu that a child receives is traditionally knitted by his father. In the Ausangate region chullos are often ornately adorned with white beads and large tassels called t'ikas. Men sometimes wear a felt hat called a sombrero over the top of the ch'ullu decorated with centillo, finely decorated hat bands. Since ancient times men have worn small woven pouches called ch'uspa used to carry their coca leaves.

Along the way they meet up with another progressive punk band, Minor Threat, whom they hang out with at the Dischord house for about a week near the end of their ill-fated tour. Plot The bands head north up through San Francisco, Oregon, and Seattle. The film documents Social Distortion and Youth Brigade live shows; it also features Minor Threat at band practice. At one point in the movie, Social Distortion's Mike Ness sits on a porch and writes future underground hit Another State of Mind. The film documents not only the complex and challenging social dynamics of the punk scene, the touring bands and their crew, but also documents the DIY punk touring circuit in its infancy. A final bus break-down in D.C. causes Social Distortion to split up. Liles and Danell abandon the group to stay with friends of Brinson's, where they voice their exhaustion with the tour and the rest of the group. Out of desperation, the others go to the local Kmart to shop for tarps with the members of Minor Threat. Mike Ness ends up being stranded when the rest of Social Distortion heads back to OC where they feel they have a better chance of making money rather than staying on the difficult tour. Ness has really no choice but to grab a flight back to LA himself and try to regroup. Youth Brigade rents a truck and drives back to Los Angeles. Four cast members have died since the making of this film; Dennis Danell (brain aneurysm in 2000) and Brent Liles (traffic accident in 2007) of Social Distortion, and road crew members Louis Dufau (drug overdose in 1988) and Dominic Mastergeorge (died in Middletown, Connecticut in 1995http://www.deathfigures.com/index.php?id=Ma-4421082). Additionally, Marcel, a wheelchair-using punk who is shown in the Montreal scene died in 1984. Manon Brière, another young Montreal punk, is still around and she fronted bands Generatorz and Maninc Manon and the Guest List. In the mid 1980s Mike Brinson went to nuclear engineering school in the Navy. He currently resides in Indiana where he has 2 sons and works in the aerospace industry. Strangely, in the beginning of the documentary, Dennis Danell jokingly says that he's 38 and old. On February 29, 2000, Danell died at the age of 38.

Eleven assorted punks would be traveling across the country in a broken down school bus. It was a chance to explore and document the punk community more extensively than ever before. On August 17, 1982, armed with one production assistant, Stuart and Small set off in their rental truck on this journey through the underground. For six weeks and ten thousand miles, they recorded the adventures of the two touring bands - Youth Brigade and Social Distortion. More than just concert footage, this film documents the rich collection of characters in and around the tour, and the hardships and dangers of life on the road. The film was made on the cheap side and the scenes that feature instructions for slam dancing were filmed as filler so that the film would be at a viable length for release and distribution. The poster was designed by Josh Freeman, now president and creative director of FreeAssociates, the design/advertising agency in Los Angeles.

In the film, she is played by Swiss actress Ursula Andress and due to her heavy accent was dubbed by Nikki van der Zyl. In the film series, Ryder is widely regarded as the first Bond girl, although she is not the first woman in the film to be with Bond (that distinction belongs to Sylvia Trench, while Miss Taro was Bond's first mission-related \\"conquest\\"). Ryder's entrance in the film, emerging from the ocean in a white bikini, holding two large seashells, while the sun shines on her wet blonde hair, is considered a classic James Bond moment, establishing both the character and actress as a sex symbol. The bikini is a movie invention - in the corresponding scene of the original novel, the character Honeychile Rider emerges wearing her belt only.The James Bond Phenomenon: A Critical Reader edited by Christoph Lindner, 2003, page 70A Brief Guide to James Bond By Nigel Cawthorne, 2012For His Eyes Only: The Women of James Bond edited by Lisa Funnell, 2015, page 13 Andress referred to the Dr. No bikini as the \\"secret of her success\\".Kathryn Westcott (5 July 2006). The bikini: Not a brief affair BBC Accessed 2008-02-15. As an homage, Halle Berry performed a similar scene in an orange bikini in the 20th James Bond film, Die Another Day. Ursula Andress was later mentioned by name in the novel On Her Majesty's Secret Service, and described as a \\"beautiful movie star\\". As such, Andress is the first of only two entertainers that have actually starred in a Bond film to be mentioned by Fleming in his James Bond novels. The other is David Niven who co-starred as James Bond in the 1967 film adaptation of Casino Royale which also starred Andress. Novel Honeychile Rider is a Jamaican shell diver, descended from an old-established colonial family. She was orphaned at the age of five when her parents' house was burned down. She then lived with her black nanny in a cellar until she was 15, when her nanny died. Rider reveals that she was also raped as a young girl by the overseer of the property on which she lives. She later avenged her rape by killing the man with a poisonous spider. Rider is an independent and very beautiful woman, with the minor imperfection of a broken nose, a lasting memory of the time the overseer punched her in the face to subdue her before sexually assaulting her. She became a shell diver near Crab Key in order to make enough money by selling the shells to American collectors, so that she can then have plastic surgery performed on her nose. While on Crab Key, she meets James Bond and confides in him she dreams of becoming a call girl in New York City order to live a good lifestyle. Bond gently dissuades her, citing how sordid prostitution is. Rider and Bond are later captured by Dr. Julius No, who attempts to kill Rider by tying her to some rocks and allowing crabs to eat her alive. However, she is aware that the crabs do not like human flesh and they won't attack her. She escapes, meets up with a badly injured Bond and, after Bond kills Dr. No's three hired assassins, they steal his armored dune buggy and escape to Bond's hidden canoe. Rider then single-handedly sails them back to Jamaica while Bond lies unconscious in the bottom of the canoe. She then tends his wounds until he can get to a hospital the next day. It is implied in the book that she and Bond will later travel to New York City where Rider will get her nose fixed; and that on her return, she will work at the Jamaican natural history museum. Before they part, Bond and Rider have dinner at her home, and the couple share a romantic night together before Bond leaves Jamaica. In later novels, Bond divulges that Honeychile Rider moved to Philadelphia, where she married a doctor by the name of Wilder and had two children with him. Film Honey Ryder is a beachcomber making a living selling seashells in Miami. As in the novel, she is a very independent woman claiming to not need help from anyone. Resourceful and courageous, Ryder states that she can defend herself against any hostile when she first meets Bond. Although she is at first wary of Bond, he is allowed to get closer when he comments that his intentions are honourable. Like Pussy Galore in Goldfinger, Ryder does not appear until halfway through the film. She comes out of the ocean singing \\"Under the Mango Tree\\", Bond startles her when he joins in singing. She pulls her dagger out, wary of Bond's position but grows to trust him. Ryder shows Quarrel and Bond a secret way to escape No's men, while being chased. After they evade No's men, she tells Bond how her father died when on Crab Key, and that she was raped by a local landlord. Ryder relates how she got her revenge by putting a black widow spider in his mosquito net and causing his lingering death. When in a marshy region of the island, Quarrel, Bond and Ryder have a close encounter with No's \\"dragon\\". Quarrel dies and the remaining two get captured. No's men wash away radiation that Honey and Bond got on their clothes and they get rooms of luxury. The next day, they meet Doctor No. When in conversation, No has Ryder taken away. After Bond kills No, he saves her from the island and they make love in a towed boat.

It is located at Prinzregentenstraße 1 at the southern edge of the Englischer Garten, Munich's largest park.  History =Nazi Germany The building was constructed from 1933 to 1937 following plans of architect Paul Ludwig Troost as Nazi Germany's first monumental structure of Nazi architecture and as Nazi propaganda.Catherine Hickley (March 1, 2017), Should Munich contemporary art museum reveal or obscure its Nazi history? The Art Newspaper. The museum, then called Haus der Deutschen Kunst (\\"House of German Art\\"), was opened on 18 July 1937 as a showcase for what the Nazi Party regarded as Germany's finest art, with celebrations including a historical pageant and a military parade.Catherine Hickley (March 1, 2017), Should Munich contemporary art museum reveal or obscure its Nazi history? The Art Newspaper. The inaugural exhibition was the Große Deutsche Kunstausstellung (\\"Great German Art Exhibition\\"), which was intended as an edifying contrast to the condemned modern art on display in the concurrent Degenerate Art Exhibition. On 15 and 16 July 1939, the Große Deutsche Kunstausstellung inside the Haus der Deutschen Kunst was complemented by the monumental Tag der Deutschen Kunst celebration of \\"2,000 years of Germanic culture\\" where luxuriously draped floats (one of them carrying a 5 meter tall golden Nazi Reichsadler) and thousands of actors in historical costumes paraded down Prinzregentenstraße for hours in the presence of Adolf Hitler, Hermann Göring, Joseph Goebbels, Heinrich Himmler, Albert Speer, Robert Ley, Reinhard Heydrich, and many other high-ranking Nazis, with minor events taking place in the Englischer Garten nearby. The 1939 Tag der Deutschen Kunst was documented by a group of hobby cinematographers on 16 mm Kodachrome color movie. The resulting 30-minute film is still pristine today due to Kodachrome's unusual archival properties, and is available in a variety of editions on VHS and DVD, such as Farben 1939 - Tag der Deutschen Kunst in München. Post-war After the end of World War II, the museum building was first used by the American occupation forces as an officers' mess; in that time, the building came to be known as the \\"P1\\", a shortening of its street address. The building's original purpose can still be seen in such guises as the swastika-motif mosaics in the ceiling panels of its front portico. Beginning in 1946, the museum rooms, now partitioned into several smaller exhibition areas, started to be used as temporary exhibition space for trade shows and visiting art exhibitions. Some parts of the museum were also used to showcase works from those of Munich's art galleries that had been destroyed during the war. The original steps at the building's entrance were removed to make way for a road tunnel, which opened in 1972.Catherine Hickley (March 1, 2017), Should Munich contemporary art museum reveal or obscure its Nazi history?

Early years He was born to a large family with eight other children. His family was poor, and when he was 10, his father fell sick and Robertino helped the family by delivering bakery products to restaurants. He enjoyed singing folk songs on his way and was noticed by people for his singing voice. After a request to perform at a wedding in a restaurant, Robertino was sought after by other restaurants who competed for his service. Robertino was singing at Cafe Grand Italia where Neapolitan actor Totò and Danish TV producer Volmer Sørensen noticed him. Sørensen was vacationing in Rome with his wife, singer Grethe Sønck, who noticed the boy. Sørensen persuaded his father to sign a contract, which stated that the boy would sing till age 17, and became his producer. That led to performances on Danish TV shows, tours of Scandinavia and Europe. Robertino would spend months on tour, singing up to three concerts a day, until his voice started to change.

The aging process takes place in ripening cellars of the Herve countryside, sometimes cut into its chalky rock. Herve comes from the Belgian town of the same name, which was part of the Duchy of Limburg. It has been produced since the 15th century. Other variants of pungent and soft \\"Limburger\\" cheeses are now made in many countries, using the name derived from the old Duchy. It is sometimes flavored with herbs. Herve has a pale yellow interior with a glossy reddish- brown coating created by the bacteria that grow during its 3-month aging. It is usually shaped into a brick when sold. The taste and flavor of the cheese deepens during the period of ripening. When young, the interior is sweet, and with age it becomes spicy. Because it is so strong, Herve is best eaten with dark breads and beers. It is often regarded as one of the most popular cheeses in Belgium.

He was the second son of Prime Minister Lord Salisbury. Educated at Eton and Oxford, he was rector of Hatfield for 28 years before being appointed bishop. Married in 1887, he had three daughters and four sons, three of whom were killed in the First World War. As bishop he was generally liked, but had a reputation for eccentricity.\\"A Field Guide to the English Clergy' Butler-Gallie, F p17: London, Oneworld Publications, 2018 Biography William Cecil (as he was generally known) was born at Hatfield House, the second son of Prime Minister Robert Arthur Talbot Gascoyne-Cecil, the 3rd Marquess of Salisbury. He was educated at Eton, where he was bullied and nicknamed \\"Fish\\", a name that stuck with him among family and friends throughout his life. Following Eton he was educated at University College, Oxford where he gained a third in law. After leaving university, Cecil worked for a few months in London's East End slums. He was ordained in 1887, and married Lady Florence (\\"Fluffy\\") Mary Bootle-Wilbraham, daughter of Edward Bootle-Wilbraham, 1st Earl of Lathom on 16 August of the same year. They had four sons and three daughters. Their eldest son Randle William was born 28 November 1889 and was killed in action during the First World War on 1 December 1917. Their third and fourth sons were also killed in that war: John Arthur (28 March 1893 – 27 August 1918) and Rupert Edward (20 January 1895 – 11 July 1915). Their second son Victor Alexander (21 May 1891 – 17 January 1977) was wounded twice in the war, but survived. Their three daughters were Eve Alice (13 January 1900 – 1994) who married Vice-Admiral Richard Shelley, her twin sister Mary Edith (13 January 1900 – 1994), and Anne (8 October 1906 – 23 October 1924). Cecil's first curacy was in Great Yarmouth, but this lasted for less than a year, because in 1888 his father had him appointed as Rector of Hatfield, which came with a fine rectory some distance from the town. However he persuaded his father to build him a smaller house nearer to the town so he could be closer to his parishioners. He remained in that post for the next 28 years, also becoming Rural Dean of Hertford from 1904; a chaplain to King Edward VII from 1909; and an honorary canon of St Alban's Cathedral from 1910. In 1908 he attended the fifth Lambeth Conference which led him to an interest in China, which country he later visited several times. He tried unsuccessfully to establish a Christian university there and in 1910, with his wife, he wrote a book: Changing China.Available from the Internet Archive. Bishopric In 1916 the then Prime Minister, H. H. Asquith offered him the post of Bishop of Exeter, and although initially unwilling to move, he finally accepted. Trevor Beeson, in his book The Bishops (2002), expresses surprise at the appointment, stating that it was \\"easily the most extraordinary episcopal appointment of the twentieth century\\" because of his total unsuitability \\"by aptitude and experience for a bishopric\\". Beeson went on to surmise that only a person with a large personal income such as Cecil could have been appointed to the see at the time because one third of its annual income was being paid as a pension to his predecessor, Archibald Robertson who had resigned aged 63 and lived until 1931. Cecil's episcopate was notable for its tolerance. He took the view that the principles of the Church were broad enough to allow wide latitude in the permissible forms of religious service, so he did not try to enforce any particular theological school of thought, and maintained a friendly relationship with the leaders of Nonconformist groups. He did, however, quarrel with his cathedral when he suggested the abolition of the office of the Dean, with the money that would be saved being used to pay for a suffragan bishop to increase pastoral care in the diocese. His proposal did not come to fruition and was put down as one of \\"Love in a Mist's\\" madcap ideas. Eccentricity As bishop, Cecil gained a reputation for eccentricity and the nickname of \\"Love in a Mist\\" was given to him, according to Beeson, on account of his \\"administrative ineptitude and autocratic unwillingness to take advice\\", ameliorated by a most loving personality. Beeson relates several instances of Cecil's eccentric behaviour. On one occasion a guest having tea with him at his home was surprised when he fed pieces of crumpets to two rats that came out of holes in the floor, and threw powdered copper sulphate on the fire to turn the flames green, remarking that he liked the colour. Once, goes another story, while robing in the vestry before a service, he held a handkerchief between his teeth, but forgot to return it to his pocket and proceeded to the altar with it still hanging from his mouth. He had been heard to complain that the Bible was \\"an awkward book\\", and while travelling around his diocese he would often ring up his wife to ask where he was. Shortly after his death in 1936, he was commemorated in the cathedral by two sculptures, both bearded: one is on the screen of the Speke chapel in which he is depicted as St Martin giving his cloak to a beggar; the other, as St Peter, is high up on the bishop's throne and was created in 1938 by the Exeter woodcarver, Herbert Read.

However, the party did win 4 seats to the Singaporean Legislative Assembly in the general election of 1959 under the leadership of former Chief Minister Lim Yew Hock, with a popular vote of 107,755 or 20.7% of the total number of votes. Following the election, the Liberal Socialist Party merged into it. After the entry of Singapore into Malaysia in the context of merger, it did not play a significant role in the national referendum of 1962 which approved the merger. It contested the general election of 1963 as part of the conservative Singapore Alliance Party, which was a branch of the federal Alliance Party. Its presence within the Singapore Alliance sparked friction with elements of the Singapore branch of the United Malay National Organisation. The Singapore Alliance fared poorly during the elections against the incumbent People's Action Party (PAP) with the Singapore's People Alliance losing all four seats. This has been partly attributed by historian Albert Lau to the failure of Lim Yew Hock to stand in the elections. Meanwhile, the political focus shifted towards the PAP-UMNO rivalry within Malaysia and rivalry between the PAP and the Barisan Sosialis.

It is located across from Westfield Garden State Plaza shopping mall. A big-box store (also supercenter, superstore, or megastore) is a physically large retail establishment, usually part of a chain of stores. The term sometimes also refers, by extension, to the company that operates the store. The store may sell general dry goods, in which case it is a general merchandise retailer (however traditional department stores, as the predecessor format, are generally not classified as \\"big box\\"), or may be limited to a particular specialty (such establishments are often called \\"category killers\\") or may also sell groceries, in which case some countries (mostly in Europe) use the term hypermarket, whereas in the U.S. there is no specific term for the format, which both Target and Walmart offer in most branches. Typical architectural characteristics include the following: * Large, free-standing, cuboid, generally single-floor structure built on a concrete slab. The flat roof and ceiling trusses are generally made of steel, and the walls are concrete block clad in metal or masonry siding. * The structure typically sits in the middle of a large, paved parking lot. It is meant to be accessed by vehicle, rather than by pedestrians. * Floor space several times greater than traditional retailers in the sector, providing for a large amount of merchandise; in North America, generally more than 50,000 square feet (4650 m2), sometimes approaching 200,000 square feet (18,600 m2), though varying by sector and market. In countries where rentable space is at a premium, such as the United Kingdom, the relevant numbers are smaller and stores are more likely to have two or more floors. Big box stores are often clustered in shopping centers known as retail parks in the U.K. and, in the United States, when they range in size from to , they are referred to as power centers.\\"U.S. Shopping-Center Classification and Characteristics\\", International Council of Shopping Centers Commercially, big-box stores can be broken down into two categories: general merchandise (examples include Walmart, Kmart and Target), and specialty stores (such as Home Depot, Barnes & Noble, or Best Buy) which specialize in goods within a specific range, such as hardware, books, or consumer electronics respectively. In the late 20th and early 21st centuries, many traditional retailers—such as Tesco and Praktiker opened stores in the big-box-store format in an effort to compete with big-box chains, which are expanding internationally as their home markets reach maturity.CQ Researcher: Big-Box Stores. September 10, 2004. Criticism=Labor Big-box development has at times been opposed by labor unions because the employees of such stores are usually not unionized. Unions such as the United Food and Commercial Workers Local 770 and the Joint Labor Management Committee of the Retail Food Industry have expressed concern about the grocery market because stores such as Kmart, Target, and Walmart now sell groceries. Unions and cities are attempting to use land-use ordinances to restrict these businesses. Urban planning 2011 photo of a Sears big box store with subway station in Rego Park, Queens, New York City, New York. This location closed in 2017. Because it is generally inaccessible to pedestrians and often can only be reached by motor vehicles, the big-box store has been criticized as unsustainable and a failure of urban planning. Big-box stores in various countries=Australia Interior of Mitre 10 MEGA, a big box hardware store in Australia The first company in Australia to use the big-box model was IKEA beginning operation in Australia in 1975. Bunnings Warehouse followed in 1995 and Mitre 10 Australia adopted the model with the \\"Mitre 10 Mega\\" stores first opening at Beenleigh, Queensland in 2004. Costco has since expanded across Australia since opening its first store in 2009. Canada Apart from major American big-box stores such as Walmart Canada and briefly now- defunct Target Canada, there are many retail chains operating exclusively in Canada. These include stores such as (followed after each slash by the owner) Hudson's Bay/Home Outfitters, Loblaws/Real Canadian Superstore, Rona, Winners/HomeSense, Canadian Tire/Mark's/Sport Chek, Shoppers Drug Mart, Chapters/Indigo Books and Music, Sobeys, and many others. The indigenous Loblaw Companies Limited has expanded and multiplied its Real Canadian Superstore (and Maxi & Cie in Quebec) branded outlets to try to fill any genuine big-box market and fend off the damaging competition that a large Walmart penetration would inflict on Canadian-based retailers. In the early 21st century, commercial developers in Canada such as RioCan chose to build big-box stores (often grouped together in so-called \\"power centres\\") in lieu of traditional shopping malls. Examples include Deerfoot Meadows (Calgary), Stonegate Shopping Centre and Preston Crossing (Saskatoon), South Edmonton Common (Edmonton), and Heartland Town Centre (Mississauga). There are currently more than 300 power centers, which usually contain multiple big-box stores, located throughout Canada. China Most large grocery stores in China are of the big box variety, selling big screen TVs, computers, mobile phones, bicycles, and clothing. Many foreign names appear, such as Carrefour, Auchan, Tesco, Lotte Mart, and Walmart, as well as dozens of Chinese chains. Most stores are three stories with moving sidewalk-style escalators. Some stores are so large as to have 60 checkout terminals and their own fleet of buses to bring customers to the store at no charge. France Many configurations exist: the hypermarket that sells many kinds of goods under one roof (like French chains Carrefour, Auchan, and E.Leclerc), most of which are integrated within a shopping mall; the supermarket that is a smaller version of a hypermarket; the market located in city centres; the department store, which first appeared in Paris, then opened in other parts of the world; the \\"category killer\\" superstore that mainly sells goods in a particular domain (automotive, electronics, home furniture, etc.); and the warehouse store.  Hong Kong  A superstore in Hong Kong To contend against Carrefour, PARKnSHOP opened the first superstore in 1996 based on the concept of a wet market. Most superstores in Hong Kong emphasizes one-stop shopping, such as providing car park services. Today, PARKnSHOP has more than 50 superstores and megastores, making it the largest superstore network in Hong Kong. The first Wellcome superstore opened in 2000 and it has only 17 superstores. In addition, CRC has four superstores in Hong Kong. However, because Hong Kong is a very densely populated city, the sizes of superstores are considerably smaller than those in other countries. Some superstores are running at deficit, such as Chelsea Heights which therefore has stopped selling fresh fish. Furthermore, some PARKnSHOP superstores and megastores, such as Fortress World, belong to the same corporation, Hutchison Whampoa. India India is going through a retail revolution since the late 1990s, following the introduction of Big Bazaar in 2001. However, even before that, large retail stores were not uncommon in India. Spencer's, a popular hypermart, traces its history as far back as 1863. Likewise Saravana Stores operating as a large independent showroom format since 1969, continue to grow in a mammoth manner. Saravana Stores operating format is said to be the inspiration for Big Bazaar's Kishore Biyani. Similarly, conglomerates, such as Raheja's, Future Group, Bharti, Godrej, Reliance, and TATA, have over the last decade ventured into large-format retail chains. However, most of the stores opened in large malls and not as independent big box format stores, even though small and medium enterprises (SMEs) still account for the majority of the daily consumer transaction needs. However, the most successful consumer retail chain that took the market and penetrated also to tier 2 and tier 3 cities was D Mart, owned by Avenue Supermarkets Limited. An attempt was made to allow international large format retailers such as Walmart into the country. However, it was successfully opposed by small retailers citing job elimination due to increased efficiency and lowered prices due to fewer losses and lower costs. India's true Big box format store was opened by IKEA in city of Hyderabad. Republic of Ireland In Ireland, large merchandise stores in the style of U.S. superstores were not a part of the retail sector until the late 20th century. Dunnes Stores have traditionally had a supermarket-plus- household-and-clothes model and now have some large stores. Tesco Ireland now runs upwards of 19 hypermarkets across the country. New Zealand The big- box phenomenon hit New Zealand in the late 1980s, with the introduction of Kmart Australia and later the \\"Warehouse\\" superstore, a local company. Mitre 10 New Zealand opened their first Mega in 2004 at Hastings, New Zealand six months before the Australian Mega store; it opened to great success with 20 more stores opening within two years. Australian-owned Bunnings Warehouse opened its first store in New Zealand in 2006. United Kingdom In the United Kingdom, Makro and Costco membership-only warehouse club stores have been around for 3 decades. General merchandise shops along the lines of U.S. superstores are not a large part of the retail sector, but this has been changing in recent years, with the creation of extra-large supermarkets such as Tesco and Asda selling a broader range of non-food goods, typically in out- of-town shopping centres or retail parks. As in the US, such large shops are sometimes called anchor tenants. The growth of online retail and budget retail has led to these chains moving away from the large out-of-town supermarkets which have waned in popularity. The term \\"big-box store\\" is not used in the UK. \\"Superstore\\" is sometimes used, but with a slightly different meaning: on road signs it means \\"large supermarket\\"; in self-service shop names it denotes an outlet larger than that particular chain's usual size. United States Exterior of a SuperTarget in McDonough, Georgia Interior of a Lowe's big-box hardware store in Brooklyn In the United States, some big-box stores may specialize in categories of merchandise (\\"category killer\\"), such as Best Buy in electronics and appliances and Kohl's, Burlington, and Nordstrom Rack in apparel and home furnishings. Big-box general merchandise retailers such as Target and Walmart are similar to the global concept of a hypermarket, although they do not always have a grocery section, and the term \\"hypermarket\\" is not in common use in the United States. \\"Discount store\\", \\"megastore\\", and \\"superstore\\" are sometimes used in addition to the industry term \\"general merchandise retailer\\". The category has its origins with Walmart, Kmart and Meijer in the 1960s, which were called \\"discount stores\\" — still an industry term for this type of store — and which between the 1960s and 1980s started to open larger-format stores called \\"megastores\\".Natalie Zmuda, \\"Walmart, Target, Kmart Johl's lead 50 years of retail revolution\\", AdAge, March 19, 2012 Warehouse club stores are another category of big box general merchandise stores, such as Sam's Club, Costco, and BJ's Wholesale Club. They require membership to purchase and often require purchasing larger quantities of goods at once.

Mally was one of the founders of deontic logic and is mainly known for his contributions in that field of research. In metaphysics, he is known for introducing a distinction between two kinds of predication, better known as the dual predication approach.  Life  Mally was born in the town of Kranj () in the Duchy of Carniola, Austria-Hungary (now in Slovenia). His father was of Slovene origin, but identified himself with Austrian German culture (he also Germanized the orthography of his surname, originally spelled Mali, a common Slovene surname of Upper Carniola). After his death, the family moved to the Carniolan capital of Ljubljana (). There, Ernst attended the prestigious Ljubljana German-language Gymnasium. Already at a young age, Mally became a fervent supporter of the Pan-German nationalist movement of Georg von Schönerer. In the same time, he developed an interest in philosophy. In 1898, he enrolled in the University of Graz, where he studied philosophy under the supervision of Alexius Meinong, as well as physics and mathematics, specializing in formal logic. He graduated in 1903 with a doctoral thesis entitled Untersuchungen zur Gegenstandstheorie des Messens (Investigations in the Object Theory of Measurement). In 1906 he started teaching at a high school in Graz, at the same time collaborating with Adalbert Meingast and working as Meinong's assistant at the university. He also maintained close contacts with the Graz Psychological Institute, founded by Meinong. In 1912, he wrote his habilitation thesis entitled Gegenstandstheoretische Grundlagen der Logik und Logistik (Object-theoretic Foundations for Logics and Logistics) at Graz with Meinong as supervisor. From 1915 to 1918 he served as an officer in the Austro-Hungarian Army. After the end of World War I, Mally joined the Greater German People's Party, which called the unification of German Austria with Germany. In the same period, he started teaching at the university and in 1925 he took over Meinong's chair. In 1938, he became a member of the National Socialist Teachers League and two months after the Anschluss he joined the NSDAP. He continued teaching during the Nazi administration of Austria until 1942 when he retired. He died in 1944 in Schwanberg. Philosophical work=Mally's deontic logic Mally was the first logician ever to attempt an axiomatization of ethics (Mally 1926). He used five axioms, which are given below. They form a first-order theory that quantifies over propositions, and there are several predicates to understand first. !x means that x ought to be the case. Ux means that x is unconditionally obligatory, i.e. that !x is necessarily true. ∩x means that x is unconditionally forbidden, i.e. U(¬x). A f B is the binary relation A requires B, i.e. A materially implies !B. (All entailment in the axioms is material conditional.) It is defined by axiom III, whereas all other terms are defined as a preliminary. \\\\begin{array}{rl} \\\\mbox{I.} & ((A\\\\; \\\\operatorname{f}\\\\; B) \\\\And (B \\\\to C)) \\\\to (A\\\\; \\\\operatorname{f}\\\\; C) \\\\ \\\\mbox{II.} & ((A\\\\; \\\\operatorname{f}\\\\; B) \\\\And (A\\\\;\\\\operatorname{f}\\\\;C)) \\\\to (A\\\\; \\\\operatorname{f}\\\\; (B \\\\And C)) \\\\ \\\\mbox{III.} & (A\\\\; \\\\operatorname{f}\\\\; B) \\\\leftrightarrow\\\\; !(A \\\\to B) \\\\ \\\\mbox{IV.} & \\\\exists U\\\\; !U \\\\ \\\\mbox{V.} & eg (U\\\\; \\\\operatorname{f}\\\\; \\\\cap) \\\\end{array} Note the implied universal quantifiers in the above axioms. The fourth axiom has confused some logicians because its formulation is not as they would have expected, since Mally gave each axiom a description in words also, and he said that axiom IV meant \\"the unconditionally obligatory is obligatory\\", i.e. (as many logicians have insisted) UA → !A. Meanwhile, axiom 5 lacks an object to which the predicates apply, a typo. However, it turns out these are the least of Mally's worries (see below). Failure of Mally's deontic logic Theorem: This axiomatization of deontic logic implies that !x if and only if x is true, OR !x is unsatisfiable. (This makes it useless to deontic logicians.) Proof: Using axiom III, axiom I may be rewritten as (!(A → B) & (B → C)) → !(A → C). Since B → C holds whenever C holds, one immediate consequence is that (!(A → B) → (C → !(A → C))). In other words, if A requires B, it requires any true statement. In the special case where A is a tautology, the theorem has consequence (!B → (C → !C)). Thus, if at least one statement ought be true, every statement must materially entail it ought be true, and so every true statement ought be true. As for the converse (i.e. if some statement ought be true then all statements that ought be true are true), consider the following logic: ((U → !A) & (A → ∩)) → (U → !∩) is a special case of axiom I, but its consequent contradicts axiom V, and so ¬((U → !A) & (A → ∩)). The result !A → A can be shown to follow from this, since !A implies that U → !A and ¬A implies that A → ∩; and, since these are not both true, we know that !A → A. Mally thought that axiom I was self-evident, but he likely confused it with an alternative in which the implication B → C is logical, which would indeed make the axiom self-evident. The theorem above, however, would then not be demonstrable. The theorem was proven by Karl Menger, the next deontic logician. Neither Mally's original axioms nor a modification that avoids this result remains popular today. Menger did not suggest his own axioms. (See also deontic logic for more on the subsequent development of this subject.) Metaphysics In metaphysics, Mally is known for introducing a distinction between two kinds of predication, a strategy better known as the dual predication approach, for solving the problem of nonexistent objects (Mally 1912). He also introduced a similar strategy, the dual property strategy, but did not endorse it. The dual property strategy was eventually adopted by Meinong. Mally developed a realistic approach to ontology (Mally 1935) and saw himself in opposition to the Vienna Circle and the logical positivists. Legacy Mally's metaphysical work influences some contemporary metaphysicians and logicians working in abstract object theory, especially Edward Zalta. The analytic philosopher David Kellogg Lewis argued forcefully that the name of the fictional Australian poet Ern Malley, created by James McAuley and Harold Stewart, was an allusion to Mally.

Aperture priority, often abbreviated A or Av (for aperture value) on a camera mode dial, is a setting on some cameras that allows the user to set a specific aperture value (f-number) while the camera selects a shutter speed to match it that will result in proper exposure based on the lighting conditions as measured by the camera's light meter. This is different from manual mode, where the user must decide both values, shutter priority where the user picks a shutter speed with the camera selecting an appropriate aperture, or program mode where the camera selects both. Uses=Depth of field As an image's depth of field is inversely proportional to the size of the lens's aperture, aperture priority mode is often used to allow the photographer to control the focus of objects in the frame. Aperture priority is therefore useful in landscape photography, for example, where it may be desired that objects in foreground, middle distance, and background all be rendered crisply, while shutter speed is immaterial. To obtain this large depth of field, a narrow aperture (identified by a high f-number, e.g. f/16 or f/22) is necessary. Aperture priority mode also finds use in portrait photography, where a wide aperture (identified by a low number, e.g. f/1.4 or f/2.8) and therefore smaller depth of field may be desired to throw the background out of focus and make it less distracting. Shutter speed Another common use of aperture priority mode is to indirectly affect shutter speed for a desired effect. In landscape photography, a user might select a small aperture when photographing a waterfall, so that the camera will select a slow shutter speed (to allow a sufficient amount of light to reach the film or sensor for proper exposure), thereby causing the water to blur through the frame. At the contrary, a larger aperture allows to shorten the shutter speed reducing the hand jitter by taking a picture without a tripod or, in alternative, a lower ISO to enhance the image quality by reducing the noise. When shooting a portrait in dim lighting, the photographer might choose to open the lens to its maximum aperture in hopes of getting enough light for a good exposure while maintaining the shortest possible shutter speed to reduce blur.

Delano grew up in Newburgh, New York, and spent three years in Hong Kong. She gave birth to Franklin in 1882, and was a devoted mother to him for the remainder of her life, including home schooling and living close by in adulthood. She had a complex relationship with her daughter-in-law Eleanor, which has led to media portrayals of her as a domineering and fearsome mother-in-law, though these are at odds with other views. She died in 1941, with her son, then the President, at her side. Childhood Sara Delano was born at the Delano Estate in the town of Newburgh, New York, to Warren Delano Jr. and Catherine Robbins Lyman. She had ten siblings, two of whom died as small children. Three more died in their twenties. In 1862, Sara, her mother Catherine, and six brothers and sisters traveled to Hong Kong on the clipper ship Surprise, where they joined Warren Delano who had resumed his business of trading in opium, then still legal. On board ship, Sara enjoyed spending time in the sailmaker's loft listening to the sailmaker tell sea stories. Her brother Fred discovered Catherine's journal of the voyage many years later, in 1928. In 1865, she moved with her family back to Newburgh. She was educated at home, aside from a brief period in a girls' school in Dresden, Germany in 1876. Delano was described as 5'10\\" (178 cm), and an intelligent debutante beauty in her youth. She was also known for her sense of purpose that many young women of her age and class lacked at the time. Family After many suitors, Sara married James Roosevelt I in 1880. Two years later, she gave birth to a son, Franklin Delano Roosevelt, on January 30, 1882. After the birth of her son, doctors advised Sara not to have any more children, and thus the young Franklin became the focus of her attention. Many wealthy parents of this time period relied on servants to care for their children, but not Sara. She taught Franklin reading and geography, and employed tutors rather than sending him to a conventional school. After the death of her husband in 1900, she temporarily moved to Boston, Massachusetts to be close to her son who was then studying at Harvard University. Sara did not approve of many of the women that her son courted. When Franklin fell in love with his distant cousin, Eleanor Roosevelt, Sara was determined to change his mind. She tried to coerce him out of the engagement, but with no luck, she insisted that her son keep his arrangement a secret for over a year. Sara was heavily involved in the lives of Franklin and Eleanor's children. She often offered advice on how to raise them, and frequently undermined the couple's disciplinary skills by spoiling her grandchildren. Eleanor often relied on Sara's direction to make her feel more secure in her role of being a mother. Though Sara became known popularly as a stereotypical domineering mother-in-law after being portrayed as much in the film Sunrise at Campobello, her actual relationship with Eleanor was much more complex. The pair grew close during the early years of the marriage as Eleanor's mother had died when she was young, and she used Sara as a surrogate mother to discuss issues. She supported Eleanor after she discovered Franklin's affair with Lucy Mercer, which put the marriage close to collapse. However, the relationship began to be more distant after Eleanor became more heavily involved in politics and activism. Franklin Roosevelt never had a home of his own that was separate from that of his mother's. In 1906, Roosevelt commissioned a pair of houses to be built at E 65 Street, New York City, as a wedding present for Franklin and his wife, Eleanor, on the strict condition that she could move in next to them. She oversaw a series of connecting doors between the houses, allowing her access to the drawing room and children's bedrooms in the neighbouring property. Her son and daughter-in-law moved out after Franklin took office in the White House in 1933. She lived to see Franklin elected President of the United States three times, becoming the first Presidential mother to vote for her son. Sara continued to support her son's career, even standing in as First Lady on several occasions. She was always prepared to say something positive about her son, and remained highly protective of him and his family. fireside chat four days after his mother's death, FDR wears a black armband of mourning (September 11, 1941) Death Sara Delano Roosevelt died on September 7, 1941 with the President at her side, two weeks before her 87th birthday. \\"Minutes after her death, the largest oak tree at Hyde Park toppled to the ground.

His mother's memory is commemorated with the Sara Delano Roosevelt Park in New York City's Lower East Side, which was dedicated during her lifetime, in 1934. She was buried next to her husband at the churchyard at St. James Episcopal Church in Hyde Park. In 2003, the City University of New York announced they would restore Roosevelt's former home, now known as the Sara Delano Roosevelt Memorial House, on 47 East 65th Street, where she lived from 1908 until her death.

It consisted of the local branch of the United Malays National Organisation (UMNO), the Malay Union, the local chapters of the Malayan Chinese Association and the Malayan Indian Congress, and former Chief Minister Lim Yew Hock's Singapore People's Alliance (SPA). This alliance was formalized on June 24, 1963 as the Singaporean component of the ruling Alliance Party in Malaya. Its campaign policy during the 1963 elections was similar to what the UMNO used in federal elections in Malaysia, and alleged the ruling People's Action Party (PAP) mistreated the Malays, one of the major races in Singapore. While the Singapore Alliance also supported merger within the Federation of Malaysia and was anti-Communist, it sought to extend the same model of communal politics on the mainland to Singapore. Unlike the then-left-leaning and socialist PAP, it was identified with the political right. Throughout its history, the Singapore Alliance has only held seven seats with the SPA holding four seats and the Singapore United Malay National Organization occupying three seats in Malay-dominated areas like Geylang Serai, Kampong Kembangan, and the Southern Islands. During the 1963 general election, the Alliance performed poorly and lost all its seats. Its participation in the 1963 election further heightened tensions between UMNO and the PAP as they had earlier agreed neither side would participate in each other's elections until Malaysia, which Singapore was then an autonomous state of, was more mature. After the 1963 elections, the Singapore Alliance was left in the political wilderness. While the coalition was briefly reformed and re- registered as the \\"Alliance Party Singapura\\" in 1966, it did contest any future elections in Singapore and gradually faded from the political scene. Most of its component parties eventually ceased to operate with the exception of Pertubuhan Kebangsaan Melayu Singapura, which subsequently joined the Singapore Democratic Alliance.

It affects fish farms in Canada, Norway, Scotland and Chile, causing severe losses to infected farms. ISA has been a World Organisation for Animal Health notifiable disease since 1990. In the EU, it is classified as a non-exotic disease, and is monitored by the European Community Reference Laboratory for Fish Diseases. Virology ISA is caused by the infectious salmon anemia virus (ISAV). ISAV, a RNA virus, is the only species in the genus \\"Isavirus\\" which is in the family Orthomyxoviridae, and therefore related to the influenza viruses. The genome encodes at least 10 proteins. There are several distinct strains of the virus. The most common are a European strain and a North American strain. Pathology ISA virus causes severe anemia in infected fish. Unlike the mature red blood cells of mammals, the mature red blood cells of fish contain DNA, and can become infected by viruses. The fish develop pale gills, and may swim close to the water surface, gulping for air. However, the fish may show no external signs of illness and maintain a normal appetite, until suddenly dying. The disease can progress slowly throughout an infected farm and, in the worst cases, death rates may approach 100%. Post-mortem examination of the fish has shown a wide range of causes of death. The liver and spleen may be swollen, congested or partially already dead. The circulatory system may stop working, and the blood may be contaminated with dead blood cells. Red blood cells still present burst easily, and the numbers of immature and damaged blood cells are increased. Infectious salmon anemia appears to be most like influenza viruses. Its mode of transfer and the natural reservoirs of infectious salmon anemia virus are not fully understood. Apart from Atlantic salmon, both sea-run Brown trout (Salmo trutta) and Rainbow trout (Onchorhyncus mykiss) can be infected, but do not become sick, so it is thought possible that these species may act as notable carriers and reservoirs of the virus. Research shows that while several species of Pacific salmon can be carriers of the virus, even highly pathogenic strains, Pacific salmon currently show high relative resistance and no ISAV-related symptoms. However, the potential for ISAV adaptation to Pacific salmon exists. Epidemiology In the autumn of 1984, a new disease was observed in Atlantic salmon being farmed along the southwest coast of Norway. The disease, which was named infectious salmon anemia, spread slowly, but caused the death of up to 80% of salmon stock in some hatcheries.Collins Edexcel International GCSE Biology, Student Book () p. 328 By June 1988 it had become sufficiently widespread and serious to require the Norwegian Ministry of Agriculture, Fisheries and Food to declare it a notifiable disease. In the summer of 1996, a new disease appeared in Atlantic salmon being farmed in New Brunswick, Canada. The death rate of the fish on affected farms was very high and, following extensive scientific examination of the victims, the disease was named \\"hemorrhagic kidney syndrome.\\" Although the source and distribution of this disease was not known, the results of studies by Norwegian and Canadian scientists showed conclusively that the same virus was responsible for both infectious salmon anemia and hemorrhagic kidney syndrome. In May 1998, a salmon farm at Loch Nevis on the west coast of Scotland reported its suspicions of an outbreak of infectious salmon anemia. The suspicions were confirmed, and by the end of the year, the disease had spread to an additional fifteen farms not only on the Scottish mainland but also on Skye and Shetland. In 2008, there was an outbreak of ISA in Shetland. ISA was detected in fish from just one site. There is no evidence the disease has spread beyond this site, but two nearby SSF cages are under suspicion of carrying the disease and are also now clear of fish. In 2011, two wild Pacific salmon taken from the central coast of British Columbia were suspected to have ISA after preliminary tests showed possible evidence of the virus. However, extensive testing by the Canadian Food Inspection Agency to try to amplify and culture the virus were unsuccessful, prompting the agency to conclude that the ISA virus was not present. In February 2012, a confirmed outbreak of ISA in Nova Scotia resulted in the destruction of up to 750,000 salmon.Salmon virus confirmed at N.S. fish farm cbc.ca, from 8 March 2012 In July 2012, a confirmed outbreak of infectious salmon anemia in Newfoundland and Labrador, Canada, prompted the destruction of 450,000 farmed salmon by the Canadian Food Inspection Agency and an outbreak was also confirmed at another site in late 2012. In mid-2012, another outbreak was identified in Nova Scotia, with the 240,000 fish being allowed by CFIA to mature to market size before being harvested in early 2013 by the operator and processed for the consumer market. After being held by the CFIA, the fish was declared fit for human consumption despite the presence of the virus as the disease \\"poses no risk to human health\\". In January 2016, it was announced that the virus had been discovered in farmed and wild salmon British Columbia for the first time. In Chile, ISA was first isolated from a salmon farm in the 1990s and described for the first time in 2001, although the initial presence never resulted in widespread problems. However, since June 2007, the national industry has been dealing with a serious ISA outbreak which has not yet been completely brought under control and has been responsible for an important decline in the industry, closure of many farms and high unemployment. The virus was detected in an Atlantic salmon farm in Chiloé Archipelago in Los Lagos Region and spread to the fjords and channels of Aysén Region to the south almost immediately. Transmission The virus is spread by contact with infected fish or their secretions, or contact with equipment or people who have handled infected fish. The virus can survive in seawater, so a major risk factor for any uninfected farm is its proximity to an already infected farm. The Lepeophtheirus salmonis sea louse, a small crustacean parasite that attacks the protective mucus, scales and skin of the salmon, can carry the virus passively on its surface and in its digestive tract. Under laboratory conditions Lepeophtheirus salmonis can passively transfer ISA. It is not known whether the ISA virus can reproduce itself in the sea louse, although this is a possibility as viruses can use secondary vectors for transmission, for example Arboviruses such as dengue fever, West Nile virus, or African swine fever virus. Diagnosis Clinical signs and pathology may suggest infection. Viral identification is possible using immunofluorescence and PCR.Infectious Salmon Anaemia expert reviewed and published by WikiVet, accessed 10 October 2011. Treatment and control There is no treatment once fish are infected. ISA is a major threat to the viability of salmon farming and is now the first of the diseases classified on List One of the European Commission’s fish health regime. Amongst other measures, this requires the total eradication of the entire fish stock should an outbreak of the disease be confirmed on any farm. The economic and social consequences of both the disease and the measures used to control it are thus very far reaching. Infectious salmon anemia is currently regarded as a serious threat not only to farmed Atlantic salmon, but also to dwindling stocks of wild Atlantic salmon. Recent research involving a multi-year study of wild Atlantic salmon from North America shows that infected salmon that survive infection generate antibodies against the virus. Work is now underway to develop a vaccine against ISA. Evolution There are several distinct strains of the virus, some are pathogenic and some are not. The most common are a European strain and a North American strain. Genetic research into the ISA virus shows that the European and North American strains of the virus diverged from each other sometime around 1900. This research points out that starting in 1879 when rainbow trout were first brought to Europe from North America, there were many transfers of fish across the Atlantic ocean which may have carried the ISA virus. Some species were introduced to Europe from North America, and some species were introduced to North America from Europe. Given that the virus did not evolve into two separate strains until around 1900, and given how many transfers of fish there were, according to this research, \\"At present it is therefore not possible to suggest a geographical origin of the ISA virus.\\" Another study suggests that this virus was introduced into Norway between 1932 and 1959 and that the original strain was the European subtype found in North America. The strains found in Chile were transmitted from Norway between 1995 and 2007.

Andréasson has created children's comics since 1944, mainly for the Swedish market, but his works have been published in several languages. He created mostly his own, original characters and features, which included the comic features \\"Brum\\", \\"Lille Rikard och Hans Katt\\" (Little Rikard and his cat), \\"Rulle och Maja\\" (Rulle and Maja), \\"Nicke Bock\\" (Nicke goat), \\"Åsnan Kal\\" (Kal the donkey), \\"Nalle Ritar och Berättar\\" (Nalle draws and tells), \\"Teddy\\", \\"Habibu\\" and \\"Pellefant\\". His most famous creation, however, is \\"Bamse\\", created in the 1960s, an often educational comic featuring \\"the world's strongest bear\\". This feature was highly successful, and was followed by several animated cartoons, as well as a comic book. The comic book started in 1973, featured exclusively Swedish material, and is still one of Sweden's most popular comic books today. In the 1970s, Andréasson began contracting other artists to do the artwork, while he still wrote the stories and kept a strict editorial control of the contents. For example, he refused to publish commercial ads in a magazine aimed at children. He was also rather restrictive with using his creations for commercial merchandising (sans for a few exceptional cases). He retired in 1990, and left his comic to the publishing house Egmont.

Course The Putumayo River forms part of Colombia's border with Ecuador, as well as most of the frontier with Peru. Known as the Putumayo in the former three nations, it is called the Içá when it crosses into Brazil. The Putumayo originates in the Andes Mountains east of the city of Pasto, Colombia. It empties into the Solimões (upper Amazon) near the municipality of Santo Antônio do Içá, Brazil. Major tributaries include the Guamués River, San Miguel, Güeppí, Cumpuya, Algodón, Igara-Paraná, Yaguas, Cotuhé, and Paraná de Jacurapá rivers. The river flows through the Solimões-Japurá moist forests ecoregion. History=Exploration In the late 19th century, the Içá was navigated by the French explorer Jules Crevaux (1847–1882). He ascended it in a steamer drawing of water, and running day and night. He reached Cuembí, above its mouth, without finding a single rapid. Cuembí is only from the Pacific Ocean, in a straight line, passing through the town of Pasto in southern Colombia. Creveaux discovered the river sediments to be free of rock to the base of the Andes; the river banks were of argillaceous earth and the bottom of fine sand. Rubber boom era During the Amazon rubber boom of the late 19th and early 20th centuries, the land around the Putumayo became a major rubber-producing region, where Julio César Arana's Peruvian Amazon Company maintained a production network centered on the nearby city of Iquitos. This production network mainly relied on the labor of indigenous Indians, who suffered from widespread human rights abuses. These abuses were first publicized in 1909 within the British press by the American engineer Walter Hardenburg, who had been briefly imprisoned by Arana's private police force in 1907 while visiting the region; Hardenburg later published his book The Putumayo: The Devil's Paradise in 1913. In response to Hardenburg's exposé, the British government sent the consul Roger Casement (who had previously publicized Belgian atrocities in the rubber business of the Congo Free State) to investigate the matter; between 1910 and 1911, Casement subsequently wrote a series of condemnatory reports criticizing the atrocities of the PAC, for which he received a knighthood.Fintan O'Toole, \\"The Multiple Hero\\", The New Republic, 2 August 2012, accessed 23 October 2014 Casement's reports later formed much of the basis for the 1987 book Shamanism, Colonialism, and the Wild Man by the anthropologist Michael Taussig, which analyzed how the acts of terror committed by British capitalists along the Putumayo River in Colombia had created a distinct \\"space of death.\\" Modern-day Today the river is a major transport route. Almost the entire length of the river is navigated by boats. Cattle farming, along with the rubber trade, is also a major industry on the banks of the Içá. Rubber and balatá (a substance very much like gutta- percha, to the point where it is often called gutta-balatá) from the Içá area are shipped to Manaus, Brazil. On March 1, 2008, Raúl Reyes and 14 of his fellow Revolutionary Armed Forces of Colombia guerrilla companions were killed while on the Ecuadorian side of the border by Colombian military forces.

The house retains its Tudor chapel, with stained glass. The classical portico on the north front, the first of its kind in England, was added in 1654 by Inigo Jones's pupil John Webb for the lawyer and politician Chaloner Chute. In the mid-eighteenth century The Vyne belonged to Horace Walpole's close friend John Chaloner Chute, who designed the Palladian staircase, whose magnificent apparent scale belies its actual small size. In 1827, The Vyne was inherited by William Lyde Wiggett Chute from the reverend Thomas Vere Chute. Chute lived there from the death of Elizabeth Chute, widow of William Chute, in 1842 until his death in 1879 during which time he greatly improved the estate, particularly the access routes which were known for their poor quality. Horace Walpole had described them in the eighteenth century as so bad that the house \\"must be approached upon stilts\\". His improvements were recorded in articles\\"Farming in Hampshire\\", Vol. XLVIII. that he wrote for the journal of the Royal Agricultural Society of England.

For most of his life Baudouin de Courtenay worked at Imperial Russian universities: Kazan (1874–1883), Dorpat (as Tartu, Estonia was then known) (1883–1893), Kraków (1893–1899) in Austria-Hungary, and St. Petersburg (1900–1918), and in Russia he is recognized as a Russian scientist.Бодуэн де Куртенэ, Иван Александрович // Новая иллюстрированная энциклопедия. Кн. 3. Би-Ве. — М.: Большая Российская энциклопедия, 2003. — 256 с.: ил. — С. 27 — 28. — (кн. 3), . In 1919-1929 he was a professor at the re-established University of Warsaw in a once again independent Poland.  Biography  He was born in Radzymin, in the Warsaw Governorate of Congress Poland (a state in personal union with the Russian Empire), to a family of distant French extraction. One of his ancestors had been a French aristocrat who immigrated to Poland during the reign of Polish King August II the Strong. In 1862 Baudouin de Courtenay entered the \\"Main School,\\" a predecessor of the University of Warsaw. In 1866 he graduated from its historical and philological faculty and won a scholarship of the Russian Imperial Ministry of Education. After leaving Poland, he studied at various foreign universities, including those of Prague, Jena and Berlin. In 1870 he received a doctorate from the University of Leipzig for his Polish-language dissertation On the Old Polish Language Prior to the 14th Century. Baudouin de Courtenay established the Kazan school of linguistics in the mid-1870s and served as professor at the local university from 1875. Later he was chosen as the head of linguistics faculty at the University of Dorpat (now Tartu, Estonia) (1883–1893). Between 1894 and 1898 he occupied the same post at the Jagiellonian University in Kraków only to be appointed to St. Petersburg, where he continued to refine his theory of phonetic alternations. After Poland regained independence in 1918, he returned to Warsaw, where he formed the core of the linguistics faculty of the University of Warsaw. From 1887 he held a permanent seat in the Polish Academy of Skills and from 1897 he was a member of the Petersburg Academy of Sciences. In 1925 he was one of the co-founders of the Polish Linguistic Society. His work had a major impact on 20th-century linguistic theory, and it served as a foundation for several schools of phonology. He was an early champion of synchronic linguistics, the study of contemporary spoken languages, which he developed contemporaneously with the structuralist linguistic theory of Swiss linguist Ferdinand de Saussure. Among the most notable of his achievements is the distinction between statics and dynamics of languages and between a language (an abstract group of elements) and speech (its implementation by individuals) – compare Saussure's concepts of langue and parole. Together with his students, Mikołaj Kruszewski and Lev Shcherba, Baudouin de Courtenay also shaped the modern usage of the term phoneme (Baudouin de Courtenay 1876–77 and Baudouin de Courtenay 1894),Baudouin de Courtenay (1876–7), A detailed programme of lectures for the academic year 1876-77, p. 115.Baudouin de Courtenay (1894), \\"Próba teorii alternacji fonetycznych\\", Część I – Ogólna RWF, 20, pp. 219–364; translated in German in Jan. 1895 as Versuch einer Theorie phonetischer Alternationen [An Attempt at a Theory of Phonetic Alternations]; excerpts in English in A Baudouin de Courtenay Anthology: The Beginnings of Structural Linguistics, ed. and trans.

His work on the theory of phonetic alternations may have had an influence on the work of Ferdinand de Saussure according to E. F. K. Koerner.E. F. K. Koerner, Ferdinand de Saussure: Origin and Development of His Linguistic Thought in Western Studies of Language. A contribution to the history and theory of linguistics, Braunschweig: Friedrich Vieweg & Sohn [Oxford & Elmsford, N.Y.: Pergamon Press], 1973. Three major schools of 20th-century phonology arose directly from his distinction between physiophonetic (phonological) and psychophonetic (morphophonological) alternations: the Leningrad school of phonology, the Moscow school of phonology, and the Prague school of phonology. All three schools developed different positions on the nature of Baudouin's alternational dichotomy. The Prague School was best known outside the field of Slavic linguistics. Throughout his life he published hundreds of scientific works in Polish, Russian, Czech, Slovenian, Italian, French and German. Apart from his scientific work, Baudouin de Courtenay was also a strong supporter of the national revival of various national minority and ethnic groups. In 1915 he was arrested by the Okhrana, the Russian secret service, for publishing a brochure on the autonomy of peoples under Russian rule. He spent three months in prison, but was released. In 1922, without his knowledge, he was proposed by the national minorities of Poland as a presidential candidate, but was defeated in the third round of voting in the Polish parliament and eventually Gabriel Narutowicz was chosen. He was also an active Esperantist and president of the Polish Esperanto Association. In 1927 he formally withdrew from the Roman Catholic Church without joining any other religious denomination. He died in Warsaw. He is buried at the Protestant Reformed Cemetery in Warsaw with the epitaph “He sought truth and justice\\". His daughter, Cezaria Baudouin de Courtenay Ehrenkreutz Jędrzejewiczowa was one of the founders of the Polish school of ethnology and anthropology as well as a professor at the universities of Vilnius and Warsaw. He appears as a character in Joseph Skibell's 2010 novel, A Curable Romantic. Baudouin de Courtenay was the editor of the 3rd (1903–1909) and 4th (1912–1914) editions of the Explanatory Dictionary of the Live Great Russian language compiled by Russian lexicographer Vladimir Dahl (1801–1872).

It is the third book featuring his private eye Lew Archer. Plot introduction Middle-aged Mrs. Samuel Lawrence gives Lew Archer 50 dollars for one day of his time to find her daughter Galatea (a.k.a. Galley) who has been missing since just before Christmas. Archer soon discovers she was married to a small-time mobster named Joe Tarantine. Starting the investigation in the most likely place, with Tarantine's brother, Mario, Lew finds the man in the hospital after a severe beating that has left him almost unrecognizable. And shortly after that, a big-time mobster offers him five thousand to find Tarantine. The investigation quickly gains a body count and Lew is constantly drawn from Los Angeles to Pacific Point (a fictionalized version of La Jolla ), Palm Springs, San Francisco, and back again, trying to tie together details that seem as random as they are violent. As the bodies pile up, so does Archer's confusion, but he remains undeterred by the situation, relying on his well-honed instinct for deviant behavior and the venal intentions of others. Still, the bodies accumulate at an alarming rate, a handsome part-time actor found dead in his apartment, a newlywed husband on the lam, a boat piled on the rocks, fast-talking women, everybody with a handout or hidden agenda. Reception This book introduces the second of two cities Ross invented and was to use commonly in his work, Pacific Point, located south of Los Angeles. Anthony Boucher described it as: \\"The best novel in the tough tradition I've read since Farewell, My Lovely and possibly since The Maltese Falcon.\\"Anthony Boucher, New York Times book review, August 5, 1951. Dick Lochte wrote: \\"I'm not sure why I prefer The Way Some People Die to The Moving Target, the first book in the series, or The Galton Case, in which Macdonald distances himself from the influence of Chandler. I just like the nastiness of the plot and the sharpness of the dialogue.\\" References Category:1951 American novels Category:Lew Archer (series) Category:Novels by Ross Macdonald Category:Alfred A.

Personal life Espino, a Mexican-American, was born in North Hollywood, California. Espino is from the \\"hood\\", and sees boxing as an escape from this - looking to the day when he can present his family the keys to a new house. His mother is legally blind, and has a younger sister who is seeking a BA in Psychology. Espino is by nature a polite and quiet character, as well as a bit of a foodie. In 2011, he married his sweetheart, Ana, with whom he has a daughter, Abigail Angel Espino. Boxing career He was placed on the West Coast Team in reality tv show The Contender, and was matched against Peter Manfredo, the high-ranked boxer who had been reinstated into the show by popular vote amongst the contestants. He was unlucky to lose, the three judges giving Manfredo 144 points and Espino 141 - the maximum for the five round fight being 150. On losing, he was hugely upset at missing his opportunity to lift his family out of their \\"plight\\". However, he won his next fight on the Contender rematch undercard, stopping Jonathan Reid in the fifth round out of five, and proceeded from there to go on an eleven fight winning streak from 2005 to 2009. He was able to win the WBC Caribbean Boxing Federation Middleweight title during this time, and established himself as a nice action fight on Telefutura boxing cards. This resulted in him getting a shot at WBC/WBO Middleweight champion Kelly Pavlik. Middleweight Title Shot Miguel fought Kelly Pavlik on December 19, 2009 at the Beeghly Center on the campus of Youngstown State University for the WBC, WBO and Ring Magazine middleweight titles. Miguel lost by way of fifth-round knockout after giving a spirited effort in which he went inside and traded with the champion, but while both guys landed a lot on each other, the power difference was clearly in Pavlik's favor, as he dropped Espino a lot prior to the stoppage.http://sports.espn.go.com/sports/boxing/news/story?id=4639682 The Fighter Miguel Espino appeared on The Fighter as Alfonso Sanchez who appears during the climax of the movie.

Although they disbanded soon after, Cugowski and Romuald Lipko reformed the band in 1974 and were active until 2014.  History = Early days (1969–1974)  The band was started in 1969 with jam sessions by Krzysztof Cugowski (vocals), Krzysztof Brozi (lead guitar), Janusz Pędzisz (bass guitar) and Jacek Grün (drums). They performed cover versions of John Mayall, Jimi Hendrix and Led Zeppelin in local venues and disbanded after making a few radio recordings and several concerts. In 1970 Cugowski joined a band Stowarzyszenie Cnót Wszelakich, led by his school mate Romuald Lipko. Soon the band was renamed to Budka Suflera. After few member changes the band finally made in March 1974 to be their first major recording, \\"Sen o dolinie\\" as the Polish cover of Bill Withers' \\"Ain't No Sunshine\\". The song received much airplay, which resulted in an offer from Polskie Nagrania record label, as well as numerous concert proposals.  Breakthrough (1975–1976)  In autumn 1974, they recorded \\"Cień wielkiej góry\\", inspired by death of Polish mountaineers Zbigniew Stepek and Andrzej Grzązek in the Himalayas in 1973. It instantly became a hit and appeared on many compilations and live albums since then. The band also recorded \\"Lubię ten stary obraz\\" in November 1974 and \\"Memu miastu na do widzenia\\" in the beginning of 1975. The drummer Zbigniew Zieliński was replaced by Tomasz Zeliszewski soon after this. The first album, entitled Cień wielkiej góry after its first track, was released in 1975. This record saw some contributions from Czesław Niemen, who played his Moog synthesizer psychedelic parts in a majestic rock suite called \\"Szalony koń\\". Clocking over 19 minutes, this track took a whole B-side of the long play. The radio hit \\"Sen o dolinie\\" as well as \\"Memu miastu na do widzenia\\" were not placed on the album. The first one was rejected by the record label, because it was a cover of a foreign artist and the latter was written by Lipko solely (there was a sort of deal among the band members, they wanted only songs written by Cugowski and Lipko together on the first album). The release became a success and the band went on a tour to East Germany. There, few German versions of band's greatest hits were recorded. There were plans to release an album in Germany, but they failed as Cugowski missed a recording session. A second attempt failed, too, because of the exhausting tour that ended just before. In 1976 another band's record, named Przechodniem byłem między wami was released. It did not repeat the success of its predecessor. After the release, Cugowski decided to leave the band and start a solo career. He was replaced by Stanisław Wenglorz, an ex-singer of Skaldowie. He has only appeared on few records (\\"Rozmowa\\", \\"Kula nocnego światła\\", \\"Ślady na piasku\\", \\"Życiowy numer\\"), then unreleased and quit soon after. The next vocalist became Romuald Czystaw.  Members  The band's line-up has changed many times over the years. Since 2005 the band members are: * Krzysztof Cugowski – vocals * Romuald Lipko – keyboards * Tomasz Zeliszewski – drums * Łukasz Pilch – guitar * Mirosław Stępień – bass guitar * Piotr Kominek – keyboards * Anna Patynek – percussion * Małgorzata Orczyk – backing vocals * Irena Kijewska – backing vocals  Discography = Studio albums  * Cień wielkiej góry (1975) * Przechodniem byłem między wami (1976) * Na brzegu światła (1979) * Ona przyszła prosto z chmur (1980) * Za ostatni grosz (1982) * Czas czekania, czas olśnienia (1984) * Giganci tańczą (1986) * Ratujmy co się da (1988) * Cisza (1993) * Noc (1995) * Nic nie boli, tak jak życie (1997) * Bal wszystkich świętych (2000) * Mokre oczy (2002) * Jest (2004) POL #2 * Zawsze czegoś brak (2009) POL #19  Minialbums  * American Tour (1987) * 4 Pieces to Go (1992)  Live albums  * Budka w Operze, Live from Sopot '94 (1994) * Akustycznie (1998) * Live at Carnegie Hall (2000)  Compilation albums  * 1974–1984 (1984) * The Best of Urszula & Budka Suflera (1988) * Greatest Hits (1992) * Underground (1993) * Greatest Hits II (1999) * Antologia 74-99 (1999) * Budka Suflera dla tp.internet (2000) * The Best Of (5 track CD) (2002) * Palę sobie...

He was appointed the twenty-second Poet Laureate Consultant in Poetry to the Library of Congress in 1973. Background Hoffman was born in New York City. Career During World War II, he served in the Army Air Corps, where he served stateside as a technical writer and as the editor of an aeronautical research journal, experiences detailed in his memoir Zone of the Interior. He was educated at Columbia University, earning a B.A. (1947), an M.A. (1949), and a Ph.D. (1956). He was a member of the Boar's Head Society there. In 1954, Hoffman published his first collection of poetry, An Armada of Thirty Whales. This collection was chosen by W. H. Auden as part of the Yale Series of Younger Poets, and Auden commended it in his introduction as \\"providing a new direction for nature poetry in the post- Wordsworthian world.\\" He has since published ten additional collections of poetry, a memoir, and seven volumes of criticism. Reviewing Beyond Silence in The New York Times Book Review in 2003, Eric McHenry found Hoffman a poet of remarkable consistency, \\"no less joyful or engaged at 80 than he was at 25.\\" Hoffman has taught at Columbia University, Swarthmore College, and the University of Pennsylvania. He retired from the latter as Felix Schelling Professor of English Emeritus, and its Philomathean Society in 1996 published an anthology of poetry in honor of his efforts to bring contemporary poets to give readings in their halls. He is a chancellor emeritus of the Academy of American Poets. From 1988 to 1999, he served as Poet in Residence at the Cathedral of St. John the Divine in New York City, where he administered the American Poets' Corner.

From 1965 the couple spent summers in Brooksville, Maine.Fall 2011 Brooksville Breeze.pdf - Brooksville Maine Retrieved 2017-04-10. In 2008 Orchises Press brought out a selection of McFarland's poems, Over the Summer Water, with an introduction by Hoffman. Hoffman bears an uncanny facial resemblance to Edgar Allan Poe, about whom he wrote an intriguing study worthy of the master himself. Hoffman was one of Philadelphia's Franklin Inn Club notable members. Daniel Hoffman was one of the named plaintiffs in \\"Authors Guild vs. Google\\" (2005), the purpose of which was to prevent Google from providing a complete searchable index of extant books.

It went ‘My lola , my lola, drink some Pakola’. Origin Pakola was the creation of seven brothers from the Teli family of Dhoraji in India who migrated to Pakistan in 1947. The idea of Pakola came from its founder Haji Ali Mohammad, who dreamed of developing a drink that portrayed the true reflection and taste of Pakistan. In order to pursue his dream, Haji Ali Mohammad opened a small factory with only two machines at Lawrence Road in Karachi with Pakola Ice-cream Soda being the initial product. The drink was launched at Pakistan Air Force Base on the anniversary of Pakistan's Independence, 14 August 1950, in the presence of the first Prime Minister, Liaquat Ali Khan. Later when Pakistan Beverages (PB) came into existence at SITE Karachi, the brand Pakola was produced there. In 1979 when Pakistan Beverages was announced as a production facility for Pepsi, Mehran Bottlers came into existence and continued to produce the drink along with other products such as Apple Sidra and Bubble Up. Mehran Bottlers was managed by his nephews Zafar Habib and Arif Habib. In 2004, Mehran Bottlers and Pakistan Beverages started manufacturing cans in Pakistan. In 2004, Zeeshan Z. Habib took charge as the chief executive officer of Mehran Bottlers. Mehran Bottlers is now among the few companies that are certified HALAL, HACCP, ISO and by the FDA. In 2007, with the exception of Karachi, the Teli family gave the franchise rights of Pakola to the Leghari family who previously owned Pepsi Sukkur. The Leghari family has the right to sell Pakola nationally with the exception of Karachi, while all exports are done from the Karachi plant. Since the company's founding, many beverages have been introduced in the local as well as the international market, but none have overtaken the original Pakola drink. Varieties Several of the variants that have been introduced by Pakola: *Pakola Ice Cream Soda (1950) *Pakola Orange (1985) *Pakola Raspberry (1985) *Pakola Lychee (1991) *Pakola Fresh Lime (2006) *Pakola Water (2015) *Pakola Pomegranate (2016) Ingredients Pakola is made with carbonated water, sugar, citric acid, cream soda artificial flavor, Color: FD&C; Bleu No 1 (E 133), FD&C; Yellow No.5 (E 102), and sodium benzoate. A typical can of Pakola (8.5 fl ounces/250 ml) has 33 g of sugar, 15 mg of sodium, 0 g of cholesterol, 0 g fat, 0 g of protein, and 130 calories. Production Pakola is currently produced by two companies, Mehran Bottlers Limited and Gul Bottlers. Distribution Pakola is now available in America, Africa, Australia, Canada, Middle East, New Zealand and the United Kingdom. It is the only carbonated beverage manufactured in Pakistan that is exported globally. Glass bottles Due to the introduction of the capacity tax in 2013, Pakola discontinued the production and distribution of all glass-bottled products. The tax was levied on the overall production and distribution of the machinery instead of output, which was detrimental for companies with lower productions or smaller markets. After the collapse of this system, Mehran Bottlers quickly set up their PET lines to grasp the market once again.

It originally aired on the Fox network in the United States on November 12, 1992. After meeting his new neighbor, Laura, Bart develops a crush on her, only to later discover that she has a boyfriend, Jimbo Jones, whom he attempts to scare off so that he can have a relationship with Laura. Meanwhile, Homer sues the Sea Captain Horatio McCallister after being kicked out of his all- you-can-eat restaurant while still hungry. The episode was written by Conan O'Brien and directed by Wes Archer. Plot The Simpsons' elderly neighbors, the Winfields, finally relocate because of Homer's antics. Bart and Lisa explore the old house while it is empty and up for sale, but Bart scares Lisa away from the basement. Bart turns around to see his new neighbor, Laura Powers. Surprised, he falls down in shock and is helped back up by her and the two become acquainted. Bart instantly develops a crush on her. After Marge visits Ruth Powers to welcome her to the area, she tells Marge that she has divorced, and both become friends. Meanwhile, after seeing a television advertisement about an all-you-can-eat seafood restaurant, Homer forces Marge to come with him, leaving Laura to babysit Bart and Lisa. Homer quickly enrages the Sea Captain, devouring nearly all the food in the buffet, and is eventually banished despite not being satisfied. Much to Marge's embarrassment, Homer sues the restaurant for false advertising. Lionel Hutz is employed to represent him in court and the case is successful after Hutz convinces the mostly overweight jury that a similar buffet mishap could befall them. To avoid further legal trouble, the Sea Captain and Homer eventually agree that Homer shall be displayed in the restaurant as \\"Bottomless Pete: Nature's Cruelest Mistake\\" to draw in more customers to the restaurant and offset the cost of his eating. Meanwhile, Bart is delighted at having Laura babysitting him and attempts to impress her. She later asks him to come to his treehouse, as she has important news. She tells him she is dating Jimbo Jones, one of the bullies from his school, which dismays Bart. When Laura invites Jimbo over to the Simpson household, Bart, in an attempt to break them up, prank calls Moe's Tavern, giving his name as \\"Jimbo Jones\\", and telling Moe where he lives. Mistakenly believing Jimbo was the one who had been pranking Moe all the time, he rushes into the Simpson house brandishing a large \\"rusty and dull\\" kitchen knife and looking for Jimbo, causing Jimbo to burst into tears and beg for his life. Laura breaks up with Jimbo for not being the tough \\"outlaw\\" she thought he was. She tells Bart that she would date him if he were older, and the episode ends with the pair laughing after prank-calling Moe again. Production Conan O'Brien wrote the episode. The episode was written by Conan O'Brien and directed by Wes Archer. The episode's original subplot was intended to include American actor and comedian Don Rickles as a guest star presenting a comedy show and Homer laughing excessively at his jokes, until Rickles ridicules him. The pair were intended to start fighting and end up having to go to court. Despite O'Brien and other production staff being sure that Rickles would appear in the episode, he was reportedly upset by the concept of the storyline, as he did not wish to be portrayed as a \\"mean guy\\". When attending a Fox Broadcasting Company publicity event in New York City with Rupert Murdoch, show producer Matt Groening was introduced by Murdoch to Rickles. Rickles began shouting at Groening, accusing him of spying on his Las Vegas act and using material from that for the episode. The cast actually had been receiving recordings from Rickles from the 1950s to use as ideas on how to get the style for his animatic portrayal. Another side story the writers produced was for Homer to become an outstanding barber and hair dresser, but this was never used. \\"New Kid on the Block\\" features first time appearances from Laura Powers, Ruth Powers, and The Sea Captain. Hank Azaria based the Sea Captain's voice on that of actor Robert Newton.  Cultural references  The courtroom scene in which numerous sacks of letters to Santa Claus are delivered to court is a parody of the 1947 film Miracle on 34th Street. Hunks, the game show Homer is watching at the beginning of the episode, is a parody of Studs. The music playing while the moose eats the Simpsons' garbage is a reference to the TV show Northern Exposure. Reception In its original broadcast, \\"New Kid on the Block\\" finished 23rd in ratings for the week of November 9–16, 1992, with a Nielsen rating of 14.4, equivalent to approximately 13.4 million viewing households. It was the highest-rated show on the Fox network that week, beating Beverly Hills, 90210. In 1998, TV Guide included it in its list of the top twelve Simpsons episodes. Warren Martyn and Adrian Wood, the authors of the book I Can't Believe It's a Bigger and Better Updated Unofficial Simpsons Guide, commented that it was \\"a fun episode, introducing the Powers family [and featuring] the last appearance of the Winfields\\". In a 2008 article, Entertainment Weekly named Sara Gilbert's role as Laura Powers as one of the sixteen best guest appearances on The Simpsons.

It was signed by the Ottoman Minister of Marine Affairs Rauf Bey and the British Admiral Somerset Arthur Gough-Calthorpe, on board HMS Agamemnon in Moudros harbor on the Greek island of Lemnos.Karsh, Efraim, Empires of the Sand: The Struggle for Mastery in the Middle East, (Harvard University Press, 2001), 327. As part of several conditions to the armistice, the Ottomans surrendered their remaining garrisons outside Anatolia, as well as granted the Allies the right to occupy forts controlling the Straits of the Dardanelles and the Bosporus; and the right to occupy the same \\"in case of disorder\\" any Ottoman territory in the event of a threat to their security. The Ottoman army including the Ottoman air force was demobilized, and all ports, railways, and other strategic points were made available for use by the Allies. In the Caucasus, the Ottomans had to retreat to within the pre-war borders between the Ottoman and the Russian Empires. The armistice was followed by the occupation of Constantinople (Istanbul) and the subsequent partitioning of the Ottoman Empire. The Treaty of Sèvres (10 August 1920), which was signed in the aftermath of World War I, imposed harsh terms on the Ottoman Empire, but it was never ratified by the Ottoman Parliament in Istanbul. The Ottoman Parliament was officially disbanded by the Allies on 11 April 1920 due to the overwhelming opposition of the Turkish MPs to the provisions discussed in Sèvres. Afterward, the Turkish War of Independence was fought from 1919–1923. The Grand National Assembly of Turkey, established in Ankara on 23 April 1920 by Mustafa Kemal Pasha and his followers (including former MPs of the closed Ottoman Parliament), became the new de-facto government of Turkey. The Armistice of Mudros was superseded by the Treaty of Lausanne, signed on 24 July 1923, following the Turkish victory in the War of Independence. Background World War I took a chaotic turn in 1918 for the Ottoman Empire. With Yudenich's Russian Caucasus Army deserting after the collapse of the Russian Empire, the Ottomans regained ground in Armenia and even pushed into formerly Russian-controlled Caucasus with, at first, Vehip Pasha's Ottoman 3rd Army and, later beginning in June 1918, with Nuri Pasha's Army of Islam which excluded German officers and men. The Caucasus Campaign put the Ottomans at odds with their ally, Germany, which had been hoping to purchase Caucasus oil from the Bolshevik government in Moscow, while the Ottomans wanted to establish their eastern borders. The Ottoman armies advanced far into Caucasus, gathering supporters as far away as Tashkent, on the eastern side of the Caspian Sea. Additionally, with the Bolsheviks in power in Moscow, chaos spread in Persia, as the Russo-British favoring government of Ahmad Shah Qajar lost authority outside of the capital. In contrast, in Syria, the Ottomans were steadily pushed back by British forces, culminating in the fall of Damascus in October 1918. Hopes were initially high for the Ottomans that their losses in Syria might be compensated with successes in the Caucasus. Enver Pasha, one of the most influential members of the Ottoman government, maintained an optimistic stance, hid information that made the Ottoman position appear weak, and led most of the Ottoman elite to believe that the war was still winnable. Developments in Southeast Europe quashed the Ottoman government's hopes. The Macedonian front, also known as the Salonika campaign, had been largely stable since 1916. In September 1918, the Allied forces (under the command of Louis Franchet d'Espèrey) mounted a sudden offensive which proved quite successful. The Bulgarian army was defeated, and Bulgaria was forced to sue for peace in the Armistice of Salonica. That undermined both the German and Ottoman cause simultaneously, as the Germans had no troops to spare to defend Austria- Hungary from the newly formed vulnerability in Southeastern Europe after the losses it had suffered in France, and the Ottomans suddenly faced having to defend Constantinople against an overland European siege without help from the Bulgarians. Grand Vizier Talaat Pasha visited Berlin, Germany, and Sofia, Bulgaria in September 1918. He came away with the understanding that the war was no longer winnable. With Germany likely seeking a separate peace, the Ottomans would be forced to do so as well. Talaat convinced the other members of the ruling party that they must resign, as the Allies would impose far harsher terms if they thought the people who started the war were still in power. He also sought out the United States to see if he could surrender to them and gain the benefits of the Fourteen Points despite the Ottoman Empire and the United States not being at war; however, the Americans never responded, as they were waiting on British advice as to how to respond that never came. On October 13, Talaat and the rest of his ministry resigned. Ahmed Izzet Pasha replaced Talaat as Grand Vizier. Two days after taking office, he sent the captured British General Charles Vere Ferrers Townshend to the Allies to seek terms on an armistice. Negotiations The British cabinet received word of the offer and were eager to negotiate a deal. The standing terms of the alliance was that the first member that was approached for an armistice should conduct the negotiations; the British government interpreted that to mean that Britain conduct the negotiations alone. The motives for this are not entirely clear, whether it was the sincere British interpretation of the alliance terms, fears that the French would insist on over-harsh demands and foil a treaty, or a desire to cut the French out of territorial \\"spoils\\" promised to them in the Sykes–Picot Agreement. Townshend also indicated that the Ottomans preferred to deal with the British; he did not know about the American contact or that Talaat had sent an emissary to the French as well but that emissary had been slower to respond back. The British cabinet empowered Admiral Calthorpe to conduct the negotiations with an explicit exclusion of the French from them. They also suggested an armistice rather than a full peace treaty, in the belief that a peace treaty would require the approval of all of the Allied nations and be too slow. The negotiations began on Sunday, October 27 on HMS Agamemnon, a British battleship. The British refused to admit French Vice-Admiral Jean Amet, the senior French naval officer in the area, despite his desire to join; the Ottoman delegation, headed by Minister of Marine Affairs Rauf Bey, indicated that it was acceptable as they were accredited only to the British, not the French. Both sides did not know that the other was actually quite eager to sign a deal and willing to give up some of their objectives to do so. The British delegation had been given a list of 24 demands, but were told to concede on any of them if pressed, except occupation of the forts on the Dardanelles and free passage through the Bosphorus; the British desired access to the Black Sea for the Rumanian front. Prime Minister David Lloyd George also wanted to make a deal quickly before the United States could step in; according to the diary of Maurice Hankey: The Ottoman authorities, for their part, believed the war to be lost and would have accepted almost any demands placed on them. As a result, the initial draft prepared by the British was accepted largely unchanged; the Ottoman side did not know it could have pushed back on most of the clauses, and the British did not know they could have demanded even more. Still, the terms were largely pro-British and close to an outright surrender; the Ottoman Empire ceded the rights to the Allies to occupy \\"in case of disorder\\" any Ottoman territory, a vague and broad clause. The French were displeased with the precedent; French Premier Georges Clemenceau disliked the British making unilateral decisions in so important a matter. Lloyd George countered that the French had concluded a similar armistice on short notice in the Armistice of Salonica, which had been negotiated by French General d'Esperey and that Great Britain (and Tsarist Russia) had committed the vast majority of troops to the campaign against the Ottoman Empire. The French agreed to accept the matter as closed. The Ottoman educated public, however, was given misleadingly positive impressions of the severity of the terms of the Armistice. They thought its terms were considerably more lenient than they actually were, a source of discontent later when it seemed that the Allies had violated the offered terms during the Turkish War of Independence. Aftermath The Armistice of Mudros officially brought hostilities to an end between the Allies and the Ottoman Empire. However, incursions by the Italians and Greeks into Anatolia in the name of \\"restoring order\\" soon came close to an outright partition of the country. The Treaty of Sèvres in 1920 officially partitioned the Ottoman Empire into zones of influence; however, the Turkish War of Independence (1919–23) saw the rejection of the treaty by Turkish nationalist forces based in Ankara, who eventually took control of the Anatolian Peninsula. Ottoman territory in Syria, Palestine, and Arabia stayed as distributed by the Treaty of Sèvres while the borders of the Turkish nation-state were set by the Treaty of Lausanne in 1923.

Princeton, New Jersey, 1948) is an American creator of innovative musical instruments. He is most notable for his design of guitars and basses without a traditional headstock, which are called Steinberger instruments. He also has a line of electric basses and string instruments through his company called NS Design and was also the designer of the first ever Spector bass, the NS. In addition, Ned and Emmett Chapman, creator of the Chapman Stick, collaborated on the creation of the NS Stick, a guitar/bass \\"multi-mode\\" instrument sold by Stick Enterprises. Ned Steinberger began his design career creating furniture and custom cabinetry. In 1977, while working alongside luthier Stuart Spector, Ned designed his first musical instrument, the Spector NS-1 bass guitar. While attempting to source materials in an industrial area of New York City, he visited Lane Marine, a lifeboat builder, where he met with Bob Young, an engineer with deep knowledge of carbon fiber. Though Young was more than twice Steinberger’s age and had no experience with musical instruments, he joined forces with Steinberger after getting great feedback from his son, a recording engineer, who took to the instrument and understood the appeal of its construction.The Spector NS quickly became Spector’s most popular bass design and remains so to this day. Inspired by that first creation, Steinberger set out to explore the possibilities of bass design. His search lead to alternate materials, like carbon fiber and the headless concept. His company, Steinberger Sound, launched in 1980, found immediate success with the L2 bass. Steinberger headless guitars and other bass models followed. After selling Steinberger to the Gibson group of musical instruments, Ned started a second company, NS Design in 1990. NS Design continues Ned Steinberger's boundary- pushing designs with a family of bowed electric instruments as well as headless guitars and basses. Ned is the son of 1988 physics Nobel laureate Jack Steinberger (born 1921 in Germany).

Early life He began boxing at the age of five in Arlington, Virginia when his father who became his manager first brought him to Olympia Boxing Gym in Falls Church. Boxing immediately ignited interest in Jimmy when he realized the level of discipline, respect, and skill that was needed to be a great boxer. The Contender Lange was a contestant on the first season of the NBC reality TV show, The Contender, produced and hosted by Sylvester Stallone and Sugar Ray Leonard. Stallone’s brother attended one of Jimmy’s boxing matches in Washington DC and was so impressed, he recommended him for the show as one of the 16 boxers. Current special adviser, \\"First Lady of Boxing\\" Jackie Kallen served as 'den mother' on the show. On the show, Jimmy was placed on the East Coast team and fought Joey Gilbert in the final First Round fight, a fight Lange lost. Lange was originally scheduled to fight Anthony Bonsante however, an argument ensued over Bonsante choosing not to do so—possibly seeing Lange as a greater threat. Lange was voted back to fight in the top \\"fan favorite\\" fight at the show's finale where he beat contestant Tarick Salmaci in a majority decision. Professional career Lange is currently trained by highly regarded Don Turner who has worked previously with former world champions Evander Holyfield and Larry Holmes, among others. He became the WBE Junior Middleweight title holder after defeating local opponent Perry Ballard in a 4th round TKO in his hometown of Fairfax, VA on September 17, 2005. Lange fought a rematch with Joey Gilbert on February 18, 2006 at the Patriot Center in Fairfax, VA for the vacant NABO middleweight title. He lost the fight by TKO in the third round. Lange returned to the Patriot Center on October 7, 2006, to fightTommy Wilt. The former Contender star managed a TKO victory with 15 seconds remaining in the 10th and final round. Lange made his fourth consecutive appearance at the Patriot Center on December 9, 2006, fighting Fontaine Cabell for the WBC Continental Americas Jr. Middleweight title. The 12 round fight ended in a draw. In early 2007, International Hall of Fame trainer, Angelo Dundee, who has worked with top notch boxers such as Muhammad Ali, Sugar Ray Leonard and George Foreman, returned to Northern Virginia to be Chief Second for Jimmy. Lange and Fontaine were scheduled for a rematch on May 12, 2007. On May 12, 2007, Lange won the hard fought battle with Fontaine Cabell and won the match with an eighth-round TKO and earned the WBC Continental Americas Super Welterweight title. A shoulder injury requiring surgery forced Lange to voluntarily relinquish the belt which is now held by Julio Cesar Chavez, Jr. On November 1, 2008 at the Patriot Center in Fairfax, Virginia, in his first fight since the surgery, Jimmy appeared back in top form by winning a unanimous decision over Grover Wiley. In May 2009, he followed that fight up winning the WBC's USNBC belt via fifth-round TKO of Frank Houghtaling. Lange looked sharp in dismantling his former Contender teammate Jonathan Reid with a ninth round TKO to retain his WBC belt on September 26, 2009 at the Patriot Center. Six months later he returned to the Fairfax venue and lost his belt in a 12-round decision to Chase Shields on March 6, 2010. After the tough defeat, Lange got back on the winning streak with a pair of convincing victories over Jimmy LeBlanc (July 10, 2010, Patriot Center) and Mike McFail (August 20, 2010, Greensboro, NC). He kept the unbeaten streak going scoring a dramatic 10th round knockout of Joe Wyatt to capture the North American Boxing Association's U.S. 154-pound title on November 6, 2010 at the Patriot Center. Lange returned to the Patriot Center on March 12, 2011 and defeated Jimmy \\"The Fighting School Teacher\\" Holmes for his fourth straight win. He earned his 36th win with a unanimous decision over Mike McFail on June 25, 2011 in Virginia Beach. Headlining his 13th show in front of his hometown fans at the familiar confines of the Patriot Center on September 10, 2011, Jimmy beat Raul Munoz by 6th-round TKO to capture the World Boxing Union (WBU) championship. He successfully defended his WBU title and added the North American Boxing Union (NABU) with a 12-round unanimous shutout decision against Ruben Galvan on February 11, 2012 - his seventh consecutive win and 14th headlining event at the Patriot Center.

He committed suicide on February 14, 2005, while sitting in a car with his girlfriend and 2-year-old daughter. The motive for his suicide was not entirely clear. However, the fact that he had not been allowed to fight between the time of his elimination from The Contender and the show's finale (so as not to spoil the ending), along with the low self-esteem that may have resulted from his defeat on the show may have contributed to his suicide. Another contributing factor is considered to be the ongoing custody battle for his daughter. Turpin was one of many American reality show contestants to take his own life, but there have been examples elsewhere in the world. In 1997, Sinisa Savija, the first person ever voted off Expedition Robinson (the Swedish predecessor to Survivor) killed himself immediately after the episode aired. Najai Turpin's initials were imprinted on Ishe Oluwa Ali Smith's shorts during a match, and the episode in which Najai fought was dedicated to him.

Debuting in 1969, Brisco wrestled for multiple National Wrestling Alliance (NWA) territories throughout the 1970s and early-1980s, in particular Championship Wrestling from Florida and Mid-Atlantic Championship Wrestling, winning dozens of championships. Throughout his career, he teamed with his elder brother Jack as The Brisco Brothers. After retiring in 1985, Brisco moved into a backstage role with the World Wrestling Federation (now WWE). He had a late career resurgence between 1997 and 2000 alongside fellow veteran wrestler Pat Patterson as the onscreen \\"stooge\\" of WWE chairman Vince McMahon. Both Briscos were inducted into the WWE Hall of Fame in 2008. Amateur wrestling career Gerald Brisco grew up with five siblings and an absent father in Oklahoma. He followed his brother, Jack Brisco, into amateur wrestling, and was eventually awarded an athletic scholarship to Oklahoma State after winning two AAU tournaments.and only losing two HS matches placing second in Oklahoma States in his only two years of HS wrestling due to broken leg in football. He was a starter on the OSU freshman team winning several matches and tournaments. During the spring break of 1968, Brisco was in Missouri with Jack, and was asked to substitute for his brother's injured tag team partner despite his lack of professional training. After Brisco contracted hepatitis and injured his knee, he decided to drop out of college and become a full-time professional wrestler. Professional wrestling career= The Brisco Brothers (1969–1984)  Brisco in 1979 Brisco was trained by his brother and debuted in 1969 as his tag team partner, using the name Gerald Brisco. The Brisco Brothers were a highly successful team, amassing over twenty tag team championships over the course of thirteen years. They arrived in Florida in 1970 (with Brisco becoming Jerry Brisco) and dominated the singles and tag divisions for several years thereafter. It was also in the late 1970s that the Brisco's discovered Terry Bollea, the future wrestling legend best known as Hulk Hogan, who they introduced to Hiro Matsuda for training. Jerry Brisco would amass a number of singles championships throughout the 1970s, including becoming the first holder of Mid-Atlantic Heavyweight Championship. On June 20, 1981 he defeated Les Thornton for the NWA World Junior Heavyweight Championship. In 1983, while teaming in the Mid- Atlantic territory, the brothers turned heel against the team of Ricky Steamboat and Jay Youngblood, the NWA World Tag Team Champions. The two teams traded the belts back and forth until the feud culminated at the first Starrcade, with Steamboat and Youngblood regaining the championship. The brothers would hold the title one last time in 1984, ultimately losing to the team of Wahoo McDaniel and Mark Youngblood. They would leave the Mid-Atlantic area shortly after. The Briscos held minority interests in Georgia Championship Wrestling. In 1984, dissatisfied with the direction of the company and smaller than expected dividends, they convinced equally disgruntled majority shareholder Paul Jones to give them proxy voting of his shares. The three men and Jim Barnett sold their shares to Vince McMahon, enabling him to increase his dominance of the professional wrestling world. World Wrestling Federation/Entertainment/WWE (1984–2020) Brisco in 2012 at right The brothers entered the World Wrestling Federation in the fall of 1984, once again assuming their familiar role as fan favorites. The Briscos unsuccessfully challenged the North-South Connection, Adrian Adonis and Dick Murdoch, for the WWF World Tag Team Championship. Both men would retire from the ring in early 1985. After retiring, Brisco began working backstage as a road agent and booker for McMahon. Following the 1997 Montreal Screwjob, Brisco capitalized on his notoriety by becoming an onscreen \\"stooge\\" of Vince McMahon along with Pat Patterson. The duo portrayed a pair of bumbling comic heels and joined The Corporation and the McMahon-Helmsley Faction. They lampooned Hulk Hogan (then working for World Championship Wrestling, the rival of WWF) by mimicking his trademark gestures and using \\"Real American\\", his old entrance theme. drag at King of the Ring On the May 18, 2000 episode of SmackDown! Brisco won his first WWF championship when he pinned a sleeping Crash Holly to win the perpetually contested Hardcore Championship. Crash regained the title on June 12 but Brisco was intent on regaining. He pursued Holly around New York City but ran afoul of John Shaft, who had agreed to protect Holly. Brisco eventually regained the title the following week with the aid of Pat Patterson in the midst of a match between Crash and his cousin, Hardcore Holly. As Patterson and Brisco celebrated the victory, Patterson poured champagne in Brisco's eyes then broke a second bottle over his head. He then pinned the (kayfabe) unconscious Brisco to win the Hardcore Championship. Patterson hid from Brisco in drag in the women's locker room, and, after Brisco pursued him into the locker room, Vince McMahon booked them in a Hardcore Evening Gown Match at the King of the Ring. In the course of the match, Holly interfered and pinned Patterson, regaining the title once again. On July 15, 2005, Brisco was inducted into the George Tragos/Lou Thesz Professional Wrestling Hall of Fame. He appeared at WrestleMania 23 in a party scene and also on the July 23, 2007 edition of RAW. On March 29, 2008, Brisco and his brother were inducted into the WWE Hall of Fame the night before WrestleMania XXIV in Orlando, Florida. In June 2009, Brisco suffered three strokes. Four months later, it was announced that Brisco would not be returning to his position as a road agent in WWE. In March 2010, Jerry Brisco did return to the WWE as a talent scout and recruiter for NXT. According to Jim Ross, on October 19, 2011, Brisco suffered another stroke, a minor one. During the Raw Reunion episode on July 22, 2019, Brisco pinned Pat Patterson off-screen backstage to win the WWE 24/7 Championship. He became the third person to win both the WWE Hardcore Championship and the WWE 24/7 Championship. He would soon after lose the title to Kelly Kelly. He was furloughed, along with many other WWE employees, on April 15, 2020 and was officially released on September 10. Personal life Brisco is married, he and his wife Barbara have two sons named Wesley (born 1983) who is also a professional wrestler, known as Wes Brisco, a former FCW Tag Team Champion and Joseph who is a grad student at USF Tampa. Brisco also co-owned a body shop with his brother Bill, and longtime partner Travis Allred, known as the Brisco Brothers Body Shop. Jack Brisco was also a partner in the business before his death in 2010. The Briscos were inducted into the Chickasaw Nation Hall Of Fame in June 2016.

Although unsuccessful in defending the city, he was awarded the title of Gazi (\\"warrior\\" or \\"veteran\\") for gallantry in holding the city for five months against superior Russo-Romanian forces. In addition to his Adjutancy title, Osman received the Order of the Medjidie and the Imtiyaz Medal for his services to the Empire. He was made Marshal of the Palace by the Sultan and the Ottoman military anthem called Plevna March was composed for his achievements. The Istanbul suburb of Taşlıtarla was renamed Gaziosmanpaşa in his honour. Early life and education Osman Pasha in the early days of his military career Statue of Osman Pasha in Tokat Osman Nuri was born into the prominent Turkısh Yağcıoğulları family of the city of Tokat in Central Anatolia. His father was a civil worker who, soon after Osman's birth, was appointed to a position in the Ottoman capital, so the family moved to İstanbul. Osman attended the Beşiktaş Military High School and then graduated from the Ottoman Military College in 1852 as a Lieutenant, entering the Cavalry Arm at the beginning of the Crimean War. Military career He served in Crimea, where his bravery secured him a promotion as First Lieutenant. After the end of the war, Osman was appointed to the General Staff and, a year later, had risen to the rank of Captain with the title of Bey. In 1859 he was appointed as a military representative in the forming of the cadastral and census map of the Ottoman Empire, a job he fulfilled for the next two years. In 1861, Osman was sent to Beirut Vilayet, where a rebellion had been started by Yusuf Ekrem in Syria. In 1866 he was dispatched to another troubled area of the Empire, Crete, which was engulfed in a massive revolt. His efforts there were noticed by Serdar-ı Ekrem Omar Pasha, so he was promoted to Colonel and awarded the Order of the Medjidie, Third Class Order (Gold). His next appointment was Yemen, in 1868, where he was promoted to the rank of Major- General with the title of Pasha, but also caught a disease which forced him to return to Istanbul in 1871. After a few months of rest, he was placed in charge of the Third Army in Rumelia. In 1873 he became a Lieutenant General and returned for a short while to Istanbul, before being sent to Iskodra and later to Bosnia. His appointment there didn't last long because he couldn't get along with the local governor, Derviş Pasha, so he was moved to the Fourth Army. In 1876, the Principality of Serbia proclaimed its independence and declared war on the Ottoman Empire. Osman Pasha, who had at that time his headquarters at Vidin, defeated the Serbian Army, but in April 1877 Russia declared war on the Ottomans. The Russian troops crossed the Danube into Bulgaria and Osman, with his army of 15,000 men and 174 cannons, was tasked with protecting the important fortress of Nikopol. Before he could get there, the city fell on 16 July after the Battle of Nikopol. Osman knew that the Russian's next objective would be to cross the Balkan, the last important natural obstacle before Istanbul itself, but they could not risk that if they had a strong enemy force behind them. So he moved his army 20 miles south of Nikopol, at Plevna, a small town surrounded by hills and ravines. The first Russian attack was easily repulsed on 20 July. After that, Osman set about preparing for the next attack. He took advantage of the natural landscape and built a strong network of forts, trench lines, and redoubts that enabled him to fully use his superior armament (his troops had Krupp breech-loading artillery, long range Peabody-Martini rifles and Winchester repeaters, which severely outgunned and outranged the Russians). He also received 5,000 soldiers as reinforcements. On 30 July the Russians attacked again only to lose over 7,000 soldiers (almost a third of the attacking force). By now, with the Russian forces severely depleted and demoralized, Osman Pasha could have launched a counterattack that would have endangered the whole Russian army south of the Danube, but he chose to obey his orders and instead defended Plevna. The Russians were quick to recover. Grand Duke Nicholas, commander of the Russian troops, sent an urgent telegram to Prince Carol I of the newly independent Principality of Romania asking for Romanian support. The Romanian Army sent 40,000 soldiers with 112 guns, modern Krupp pieces equal to those of the Ottomans, and Carol I was named commander of the joint Russian-Romanian troops around Plevna. By now, the Allied Army numbered 80,000 soldiers against an Ottoman force of around 40,000. Against Carol's wishes, the Allies launched another large scale attack on Plevna on 11 September. After two days of fighting, even though the Allies had managed to dislodge the Ottomans from a few of the redoubts, almost all of them were recaptured, with the exception of Grivitza 1, taken by the Romanian soldiers. The Allies could not withstand such severe casualties, so they settled in for a siege and fully surrounded Plevna. Osman Pasha asked for permission to withdraw before the encirclement was complete, but he was denied. By December, with food and ammunition running low and his troops suffering from starvation, cold and disease, Osman knew he could not hold on throughout the winter and that no help from outside was available. Instead of surrendering, he chose to try and break through the siege lines. On 9 December, the Ottoman army attacked a sector of the Russian line and nearly broke through. But the Russians recovered and closed the breach after bitter hand-to-hand fighting, driving the Ottomans back. But the enveloped army could not return to Plevna because during the engagement with the Russian forces, the Romanian army had stormed the defenses protecting their rear, making a withdrawal to the fortifications impossible. Furthermore, Osman was wounded in the leg by a bullet and his troops panicked, thinking that he had died. With his army caught between the Allies, Osman Pasha had no choice but to capitulate surrender to Mihail Cerchez. In 1878, after the Treaty of Berlin was signed on 13 July, which recognized an autonomous Principality of Bulgaria and the independence of the Principality of Romania, the Principality of Serbia and the Principality of Montenegro from the Ottoman Empire, he returned from Russian captivity and received a hero's welcome in Istanbul, being named \\"Gazi\\" (Victorious) and promoted to the rank of Marshal. He would go on serving as War Minister on four occasions. Tomb of Osman Pasha On the night of 4 to 5 April 1900, he died in Istanbul. He was buried next to the Mosque of Fatih Sultan Mehmet as he requested. His tomb was personally commissioned by Abdülhamit II, who regarded him as one of his greatest generals. He is still revered in Turkey today as a sort of tragic hero who displayed gallant perseverance in the face of hopeless odds, and a Turkish flag is often seen draped on his tomb.  Siege of Plevna  During the Russian attack on Nikopol, Osman Pasha was in Vidin with his army. The Ottoman high command ordered Osman Pasha to reinforce Nikopol with 20,000 soldiers. While Osman was on his way to Nikopol, the city fell to the Russians on 16 July 1877. The Russians, knowing that Osman Pasha was heading to Nikopol, planned to intercept and attack his forces. Osman Pasha’s troops were 20 miles away from Nikopol. Osman Pasha quickly created a strong network of fortifications, raising earthworks with redoubts, digging trenches and gun emplacements. On 19 July, Russian troops reached Plevna and started bombarding the town. The next day Russian troops continued the bombardment, eventually forcing some Ottoman units off the outer defences. Niğbolu (Nicopolis, modern Nikopol) in 1877 was significant, as it was the site of an important Ottoman victory in 1396 which marked the expansion of the Ottoman Empire into the Balkans. Siege of Plevna Reinforcements began arriving to both sides, as fighting intensified, and the Russians launched an assault. During the first assault, the Russians suffered 4,000 casualties, while the Ottomans suffered 1,000. After this, Osman Pasha strengthened his defences. The Russians were reinforced by the army of Prince Carol I of Romania, who assumed command of the attacking army. On 31 July the Russians attacked Plevna again, but Ottoman troops managed to repulse the assault. After this second engagement, the Russians lost 10.000 men, while Ottomans lost 2,000. After suffering heavy casualties during the assault, the Russians sent out scouts, and resolved to cut off the Ottoman supply lines. To this end, Russian forces attacked the Ottoman garrison at Lovcha. This attack proved to be successful, and the Russians were able to cut off all communications and supply lines to Plevna. By now, Osman Pasha’s army had been reinforced to 30,000, while the Russian forces numbered 100,000. On 11 September, the Russians resumed the artillery bombardment, and mounted another assault. The assault succeeded in taking a few redoubts but Osman Pasha retook most of them. After the third battle, the Russians lost roughly 20,000 men, while the Ottomans lost only 5,000. Since the beginning of the war, Russian and Romanian losses reached up to 50,000. As more Russian and Romanian troops joined the siege, all attacks were halted. General Eduard Ivanovich Todleben came to see the situation of the siege. He was experienced in siege warfare, and decided to encircle the city. Osman Pasha and Alexander II of Russia The Russian-Romanian army closed in by 24 October, as supplies began to run low in the city. On 9 December, Osman Pasha decided to attempt replay attack and attacked the Russian contingent during the night. Close-quarters combat ensued, but the Russian forces outnumbered the Ottomans. Osman Pasha’s troops were driven back and he was struck in the leg by a stray bullet. Rumors of Osman Pasha’s death spread panic, and Ottoman troops were driven back and enveloped by Romanian forces. At the end of the breakout attempt, the Ottomans had lost 4,000, while the Russians lost 2,000. The next day, Osman Pasha capitulated, surrendering the city to the Romanian Colonel Mihail Cerchez. Plevna Marşi A popular Turkish march song about the Battle of Plevna was composed about him: Original lyrics, Turkish language: > Tuna nehri akmam diyor > Etrafımı yıkmam diyor > Tuna nehri akmam diyor > Etrafımı yıkmam diyor > Şanı büyük Osman Paşa > Plevne'den çıkmam diyor. > Şanı büyük Osman Paşa > Plevne'den çıkmam diyor. > > Düşman Tuna'yı atladı > Karakolları yokladı > Düşman Tuna'yı atladı > Karakolları yokladı > Osman Paşa'nın kolunda > Beşbin top birden patladı. > Osman Paşa'nın kolunda > Beşbin top birden patladı. > > Kılıcımı vurdum taşa > Taş yarıldı baştan başa > Kılıcımı vurdum taşa > Taş yarıldı baştan başa > Askerinle binler yaşa. > Namı büyük Osman Paşa. > Askerinle binler yaşa. > Namı büyük Osman Paşa. > > English translation: > > (single) > The River Danube says \\"I won't flow.\\". > It says \\"I won't ruin my sides.\\". > (chorus) > The River Danube says \\"I won't flow.\\". > It says \\"I won't ruin my sides.\\". > (single) > Osman Paşa, the Glorious, > Says \\"I won't leave Plevna.\\". > (chorus) > Osman Paşa, the Glorious, > Says \\"I won't leave Plevna.\\". > > (single) > The enemy crossed the Danube, > It attacked the fortifications. > (chorus) > The enemy crossed the Danube, > It attacked the fortifications. > (single) > From the posts of Osman Paşa, > Five thousand artilleries fired simultaneously. > (chorus) > From the posts of Osman Paşa, > Five thousand artilleries fired simultaneously. > > (single) > I struck my sword on a stone. > The stone was split from end to end. > (chorus) > I struck my sword on a stone. > The stone was split from end to end. > (single) > Osman Paşa, the Renowned, > Live thousands (of years) with your soldiers. > (chorus) > Osman Paşa, the Renowned, > Live thousands (of years) with your soldiers. > Zaplakala Šećer Đula During the battle, several Ottoman soldiers from Bosnia claimed that Osman had a relationship with a girl from Bosnia only known as \\"Đula\\". After the battle, returning Bosnian soldiers composed a poem about the suffering of Osman after they lost the battle and how he was sure that he'll never see his girl again. The poem is called \\"Zaplakala Šećer Đula\\", translated roughly to \\"The beautiful Đula started crying\\" or more accurately \\"The Sweet Rose Wept\\". The actual author of the poem is unknown and several people claimed to have written it. In Bosnia and Herzegovina, the poem is often played as a Sevdalinka. The Bosnian band \\"Divanhana\\" made a music video for it. The best known version of the poem: Original lyrics, Bosnian language: > Zaplakala šećer Đula > Osman paše vjerna ljuba > Moj Osmane gdje si bio > gdje si vojsku izgubio > > Evo mene Đulo mlada > ispod Plevna starog grada > sto mi care vojske dade > sve mi Đulo, za din pade > > Ja sam Đulo ropstva pao > britku sablju otpasao > pa sad nemam nikog svoga > osim Allaha jedinoga > > Đulo mlada preudaj se > meni nikad ne nadaj se > dušman me je zarobio > sa tobom me rastavio > > English translation: > > Sweet Djula started to weep, > Osman's Pasha faithful love. > \\"My Osman, where have you been, > where did you lose your army?\\" > > Here I am, young Djula, > below the old town of Plevna, > All the Army that was given to me my by the Emperor, > they all fell down in the name of faith. > > I am, Djula, a prisoner now, > I've surrendered my sharp sword, > Now I don't have anyone to call my own, > Except for God, One and Only. > > Young Djula, go ahead and re-marry, > Don't ever hope to see me again. > My adversary imprisoned me, > Disunited me from you. > ReferencesFootnotes * Parry Melanie (ed.)

Set in an alternative future where a Nordic supremacist and neo-fascist totalitarian regime has subjugated the United Kingdom, the film centers on V (portrayed by Hugo Weaving), an anarchist and masked freedom fighter who attempts to ignite a revolution through elaborate terrorist acts, while Natalie Portman plays Evey, a young, working-class woman caught up in V's mission and Stephen Rea portrays a detective leading a desperate quest to stop V. Produced by Silver Pictures, Virtual Studios and Anarchos Productions Inc., V for Vendetta was originally scheduled for release by Warner Bros. Pictures on 4 November 2005 (a day before the 400th Guy Fawkes Night), but was delayed; it instead opened in the United States on 17 March 2006 to mostly positive reviews from critics and was a box office success. However, Alan Moore, having been dissatisfied with the film adaptations of his other works, From Hell (2001) and The League of Extraordinary Gentlemen (2003), declined to watch the film and asked to be uncredited and not be paid royalties. V for Vendetta has been seen by many political groups as an allegory of oppression by government; anarchists have used it to promote their beliefs. David Lloyd stated: \\"The Guy Fawkes mask has now become a common brand and a convenient placard to use in protest against tyranny – and I'm happy with people using it, it seems quite unique, an icon of popular culture being used this way.\\" Plot In 2027, the world is in turmoil, with the United States fractured as a result of a second civil war and a pandemic of the \\"St. Mary's Virus\\" ravaging Europe. The United Kingdom is ruled as a Nordic supremacist and neo-fascist police state by the Norsefire Party, helmed by all-powerful High Chancellor Adam Sutler. Political opponents, immigrants, Jews, Muslims, atheists, homosexuals, and other \\"undesirables\\" are imprisoned and executed. On November 4, a vigilante in a Guy Fawkes mask, \\"V\\", rescues Evey Hammond, an employee of state-run British Television Network, from members of the \\"Fingermen\\" secret police. They watch his demolition of the Old Bailey, accompanied by fireworks and the \\"1812 Overture\\". Inspector Finch of Scotland Yard investigates V's activities. V hijacks a BTN broadcast to claim responsibility for the destruction, encouraging the people of Britain to rebel against their government and meet him on next year's Guy Fawkes Night outside the Houses of Parliament. The police attempt to capture V. Evey helps him escape but is knocked unconscious. V takes Evey to his home, where she is told she must remain for one year. V kills Lewis Prothero, Norsefire's chief propagandist, and Anthony Lilliman, the Bishop of London. Evey offers to help, but escapes to the home of her boss, talk show host Gordon Deitrich. In return for Evey trusting him, Gordon reveals subversive paintings, an antique Quran, and homoerotic photographs. V confronts Dr. Delia Surridge, who experimented on him and others at Larkhill concentration camp; seeing her remorse, he kills her painlessly. After Gordon satirizes the government on his show, his home is raided and Evey captured. She is tortured for information about V, her only solace being a note written by Valerie Page, a prisoner tortured and killed for being lesbian. Evey is to be executed unless she reveals V's location. When she says she would rather die, she is released, finding herself in V's home. V staged her imprisonment to free her from her fears. The note was real, passed from Valerie to V when he was imprisoned. While Evey initially hates V for what he did to her, she realizes she is a stronger person. She leaves him, promising to return before November 5. Reading Surridge's journal, Finch learns V is the result of human experimentation and is targeting those who detained him. Finch searches for V's true identity, tracing him to a bioweapons program in Larkhill. Finch meets William Rookwood, who tells him about the program. Fourteen years earlier, Sutler, Secretary of Defence at the time, launched a secret project at Larkhill which resulted in the creation of the St. Mary's virus. Creedy, the current leader of the Norsefire Party, suggested releasing the virus onto the UK. Targeting St. Mary's School, a tube station and a water treatment plant, the virus killed more than 100,000 people. The outbreak was blamed on a terrorist organisation. Norsefire used the fear and chaos to elevate Sutler to the office of High Chancellor, win an overwhelming majority in Parliament, and profit off the cure for the virus. Finch discovers that Rookwood was V in disguise. Though he initially disbelieves the story, his faith in the Norsefire government is shaken. As November 5 nears, V distributes thousands of Guy Fawkes masks. On the eve of November 5, Evey visits V, who shows her a train filled with ANFO explosives in the abandoned London Underground, set to destroy Parliament. He leaves it to Evey to decide whether to use it. V meets Creedy, with whom he made a deal to surrender in exchange for Sutler's execution. After Creedy executes Sutler, V reneges on his deal, killing Creedy and his men. Mortally wounded, V tells Evey he loves her before dying. Despite their earlier quarrels, Evey has grown close to V, and is visibly heartbroken by his death. Finch finds Evey placing V's body aboard the train. Disillusioned by the Party's regime, Finch allows Evey to send the train. Thousands of citizens wearing Guy Fawkes masks march toward the Houses of Parliament. The military receives no orders and allows the crowd to pass. As Parliament is destroyed, Finch asks Evey for V's identity, to which she replies, \\"He was all of us.\\" Cast Hugo Weaving in 2012. He portrayed V in the film, keeping his face hidden by his mask or obscured throughout. * Natalie Portman as Evey, an employee of the state-run British Television Network who is rescued by V from a gang of London's secret police and subsequently becomes involved in his life. * Hugo Weaving as V, a masked, charismatic and skilled anarchist terrorist who had been the unwilling subject of experimentation by Norsefire. James Purefoy originally portrayed the character, but left six weeks into filming. He remained uncredited, with Weaving replacing him on set and re-dubbing Purefoy's scenes. * Stephen Rea as Finch, the Chief inspector of New Scotland Yard and Minister of Investigations (the \\"Nose\\"), is the lead inspector in the V investigation, who, during his investigation, uncovers an unspeakable government crime. When asked whether the politics attracted him to the film, Rea replied \\"Well, I don't think it would be very interesting if it was just comic-book stuff. The politics of it are what gives it its dimension and momentum, and of course I was interested in the politics. Why wouldn't I be?\\" * Stephen Fry as Deitrich, a closeted gay talk show host. When asked in an interview what he liked about the role, Fry replied \\"Being beaten up! I hadn't been beaten up in a movie before and I was very excited by the idea of being clubbed to death.\\" * John Hurt as Adam Sutler, the former Conservative Member of Parliament and Under-Secretary for Defence, High Chancellor Sutler is the founder of Norsefire and is Britain's authoritarian elected leader. Hurt played a contrary role in another dystopian film: Winston Smith, a victim of the state in the film adaptation of Nineteen Eighty-Four. * Tim Pigott-Smith as Creedy, Norsefire's Party leader and the head of Britain's secret police (the \\"Finger\\"). * Rupert Graves as Stone, Chief Inspector Finch's sergeant. * Roger Allam as Lewis Prothero, the \\"Voice of London\\", a propagandist for Norsefire, and formerly the Commander of Larkhill concentration camp. * Ben Miles as Dascombe, the head of the government's propaganda division (the \\"Mouth\\") and chief executive of the British Television Network. * Sinéad Cusack as Delia Surridge, the former head physician at the Larkhill Detention Centre, now a coroner. * Natasha Wightman as Valerie, a lesbian imprisoned for her sexuality. * John Standing as Lilliman, a corrupt bishop at Westminster Abbey. * Eddie Marsan as Etheridge, the head of the government's audio-surveillance division (the \\"Ear\\"). Themes and interpretations V for Vendetta sets the Gunpowder Plot as V's historical inspiration, contributing to his choice of timing, language, and appearance. For example, the names Rookwood, Percy and Keyes are used in the film, which are also the names of three of the Gunpowder conspirators. The film creates parallels to Alexandre Dumas's The Count of Monte Cristo, by drawing direct comparisons between V and Edmond Dantès. (In both stories, the hero escapes an unjust and traumatic imprisonment and spends decades preparing to take vengeance on his oppressors under a new persona.) The film is also explicit in portraying V as the embodiment of an idea rather than an individual through V's dialogue and by depicting him without a past, identity or face. According to the official website, \\"V's use of the Guy Fawkes mask and persona functions as both practical and symbolic elements of the story. He wears the mask to hide his physical scars, and in obscuring his identity – he becomes the idea itself.\\" As noted by several critics and commentators, the film's story and style mirror elements from Gaston Leroux's The Phantom of the Opera. V and the Phantom both wear masks to hide their disfigurements, control others through the leverage of their imaginations, have tragic pasts, and are motivated by revenge. V and Evey's relationship also parallels many of the romantic elements of The Phantom of the Opera, where the masked Phantom takes Christine Daaé to his subterranean lair to re-educate her. As a film about the struggle between freedom and the state, V for Vendetta takes imagery from many classic totalitarian icons both real and fictional, including the Third Reich, the Soviet Union under Stalin and George Orwell's Nineteen Eighty-Four. For example, Adam Sutler primarily appears on large video screens and on portraits in people's homes, both common features among modern totalitarian regimes and reminiscent of the image of Big Brother. The slogan \\"Strength through Unity. Unity through Faith\\" is displayed prominently across London, similar in cadence to \\"War is Peace. Freedom is Slavery. Ignorance is Strength\\" in Orwell's book. There is also the state's use of mass surveillance, such as closed-circuit television, on its citizens. The name Adam Sutler is intentionally similar to Adolf Hitler. Like the so-called Führer, Sutler is given to hysterical speech. Also like Hitler, Sutler is a racial purist, although Jews have been replaced by Arabs and Muslims as the focus of Norsefire ethnoreligious propaganda and persecution. (This fact owes to the post-9/11 association of Islam and the Middle East with terrorism, combined with the fact that British Muslims far outnumber British Jews. The latter are certainly persecuted by Norsefire as well, since Norsefire is an Aryanist regime as well as a Christofascistic one.) Valerie was sent to a detention facility for lesbianism and then had medical experiments performed on her, reminiscent of the persecution of homosexuals in Nazi Germany and the Holocaust. The filmmakers added topical references relevant to a 2006 audience. According to the Los Angeles Times, \\"With a wealth of new, real-life parallels to draw from in the areas of government surveillance, torture, fear mongering and media manipulation, not to mention corporate corruption and religious hypocrisy, you can't really blame the filmmakers for having a field day referencing current events.\\" There are also references to an avian flu pandemic, as well as pervasive use of biometric identification and signal- intelligence gathering and analysis by the regime. Film critics, political commentators and other members of the media have also noted the film's numerous references to events surrounding the George W. Bush administration in the United States. These include the hoods and sacks worn by the prisoners in Larkhill that have been seen as a reference to the Abu Ghraib torture and prisoner abuse. The Homeland Security Advisory System and rendition are also referenced. One of the forbidden items in Gordon's secret basement is a protest poster with a mixed US–UK flag with a swastika and the title \\"Coalition of the Willing, To Power\\" which combines the \\"Coalition of the Willing\\" with Friedrich Nietzsche's concept of will to power. Despite the America-specific references, the filmmakers have always referred to the film as adding dialogue to a set of issues much broader than the US administration. When James McTeigue was asked whether or not BTN was based on Fox News Channel, McTeigue replied, \\"Yes. But not just Fox. Everyone is complicit in this kind of stuff. It could just as well been the Britain's Sky News Channel, also a part of News Corp.\\" Production=Development The film was made by many of the same filmmakers involved in The Matrix series. In 1988, producer Joel Silver acquired the rights to two of Alan Moore's works: V for Vendetta and Watchmen. After the release and relative success of Road House, writer Hilary Henkin was brought on to flesh out the project with an initial draft – one that bears little, if any, relation to the finished product, with the inclusion of overtly satirical and surrealistic elements not present in the graphic novel, as well as the removal of much of the novel's ambiguity, especially in regard to V's identity. The Wachowskis were fans of V for Vendetta and in the mid-1990s, before working on The Matrix, wrote a draft screenplay that closely followed the graphic novel. During the post-production of the second and third The Matrix films, they revisited the screenplay and offered the director's role to James McTeigue. All three were intrigued by the original story's themes and found them to be relevant to the contemporary political landscape. Upon revisiting the screenplay, the Wachowskis set about making revisions to condense and modernise the story, while at the same time attempting to preserve its integrity and themes. James McTeigue cites the film The Battle of Algiers as his principal influence in preparing to film V for Vendetta. Moore explicitly disassociated himself from the film due to his lack of involvement in its writing or directing, as well as due to a continuing series of disputes over film adaptations of his work. He ended cooperation with his publisher, DC Comics, after its corporate parent, Warner Bros., failed to retract statements about Moore's supposed endorsement of the film. Moore said that the script contained plot holes and that it ran contrary to the theme of his original work, which was to place two political extremes (fascism and anarchism) against one another. He argues his work had been recast as a story about \\"current American neoconservatism vs. current American liberalism\\". Per his wishes, Moore's name does not appear in the film's closing credits. Co-creator and illustrator David Lloyd supports the film adaptation, commenting that the script is very good but that Moore would only ever be truly happy with a complete book-to-screen adaptation. Casting James Purefoy was originally cast as V, but dropped out after six weeks into filming. Although at the time it was reported this was because of difficulties wearing the mask for the entire film, he later stated this was not the case. He was replaced by Hugo Weaving, who had previously worked with Joel Silver and the Wachowskis on The Matrix series. Director James McTeigue first met Natalie Portman during the filming of Star Wars: Episode II – Attack of the Clones, on which he worked as assistant director. In preparation for the role, Portman worked with dialect coach Barbara Berkery to speak in a British accent, studied films such as The Weather Underground, and read the autobiography of Menachem Begin. She received top billing for the film. Her role in the film has parallels to her role in Léon: The Professional. According to Portman: \\"the relationship between V and Evey has a complication [like] the relationship in that film.\\" She also had her head shaved oncamera during a scene in which her character is tortured. Filming V for Vendetta was filmed in London, England, and in Potsdam, Germany, at Babelsberg Studios. Much of the film was shot on sound stages and indoor sets, with location work done in Berlin for three scenes: the Norsefire rally flashback, Larkhill, and Bishop Lilliman's bedroom. The scenes that took place in the abandoned London Underground were filmed at the disused Aldwych tube station. Filming began in early March 2005 and lasted through early June 2005. V for Vendetta is the final film shot by cinematographer Adrian Biddle, who died of a heart attack on 7 December 2005, 4 days prior to its world debut.Guard, Howard Adrian Biddle obituary, www.guardian.co.uk, 18 January 2006. Retrieved 10 June 2012 To film the final scene at Westminster, the area from Trafalgar Square and Whitehall up to Parliament and Big Ben had to be closed for three nights from midnight until 5 am. This was the first time the security- sensitive area (home to 10 Downing Street and the Ministry of Defence) had ever been closed to accommodate filming. Prime Minister (at the time of filming) Tony Blair's son, Euan, worked on the film's production and is said (according to an interview with Stephen Fry) to have helped the filmmakers obtain the unparalleled filming access. This drew criticism of Blair from MP David Davis due to the film's content. However, the filmmakers denied Euan Blair's involvement in the deal, stating that access was acquired through nine months of negotiations with fourteen different government departments and agencies. Post-production The film was designed to have a retrofuturistic look, with heavy use of grey tones to give a dreary, stagnant feel to totalitarian London. The largest set created for the film was the Shadow Gallery, which was made to feel like a cross between a crypt and an undercroft. The Gallery is V's home as well as the place where he stores various artefacts forbidden by the government. Some of the works of art displayed in the gallery include The Arnolfini Portrait by Jan van Eyck, Bacchus and Ariadne by Titian, a Mildred Pierce poster, St. Sebastian by Andrea Mantegna, The Lady of Shalott by John William Waterhouse and statues by Giacometti. One of the major challenges in the film was how to bring V to life from under an expressionless mask. Thus, considerable effort was made to bring together lighting, acting, and Weaving's voice to create the proper mood for the situation. Since the mask muffled Weaving's voice, his entire dialogue was re-recorded in post-production. Differences between the film and graphic novel The film's story was adapted from Alan Moore and David Lloyd's graphic novel V for Vendetta; this was originally published between 1982 and 1985 in the British comic anthology Warrior, and then reprinted and completed by DC. Moore's comics were later compiled into a graphic novel and published again in the United States under DC's Vertigo imprint and in the United Kingdom under Titan Books. There are several fundamental differences between the film and the original source material. Alan Moore's original story was created as a response to British Thatcherism in the early 1980s and was set as a conflict between a fascist state and anarchism, while the film's story has been changed by the Wachowskis to fit a modern US political context. Alan Moore, however, charged that, in doing so, the story has turned into an American-centric conflict between liberalism and neoconservatism, and abandons the original anarchist–fascist themes. Moore states that \\"[t]here wasn't a mention of anarchy as far as I could see. The fascism had been completely defanged. I mean, I think that any references to racial purity had been excised, whereas actually, fascists are quite big on racial purity.\\" Furthermore, in the original story, Moore attempted to maintain moral ambiguity, and not to portray the fascists as caricatures, but as realistic, rounded characters. The time limitations of a film meant that the story had to omit or streamline some of the characters, details, and plotlines from the original story. Chiefly, the original graphic novel has the fascists elected legally and kept in power through the general apathy of the public, whereas the film introduces the \\"St. Mary's virus\\", a biological weapon engineered and released by the Norsefire Party as a means of clandestinely gaining control over their own country. Many of the characters from the graphic novel underwent significant changes for the film. V is characterised in the film as a romantic freedom fighter who shows concern over the loss of innocent life. However, in the graphic novel, he is portrayed as ruthless, willing to kill anyone who gets in his way. Evey Hammond's transformation as V's protégée is also much more drastic in the novel than in the film. Gordon, a very minor character in both versions, is also drastically changed. In the novel, Gordon is a small-time criminal who takes Evey into his home after V abandons her on the street. The two share a brief romance before Gordon is killed by a Scottish gang. In the film, however, Gordon is a well-mannered colleague of Evey's, and is later revealed to be gay. He is arrested by Fingermen for broadcasting a political parody on his TV program, and is later executed when a Quran is found in his possession. Release The film adopts extensive imagery from the 1605 Gunpowder Plot, in which a group of Catholic conspirators plotted to destroy the then Houses of Parliament in order to spark a revolution in England. The film was originally scheduled for release on the weekend of 5 November 2005, the Plot's 400th anniversary, with the tag line \\"Remember, remember the 5th of November\\", taken from a traditional British rhyme memorialising the event. However, the marketing angle lost much of its value when the release date was pushed back to 17 March 2006. Many have speculated that the delay was caused by the London tube bombing on the 7 July and the failed 21 July bombing. The filmmakers have denied this, saying that the delays were due to the need for more time to finish the visual effects production. V for Vendetta had its first major premiere on 11 December 2005, at Butt-Numb-A-Thon, followed by a premiere on 13 February 2006 at the Berlin Film Festival. It opened for general release on 17 March 2006 in 3,365 cinemas in the United States, the United Kingdom and six other countries. Promotion The cast and filmmakers attended several press conferences that allowed them to address issues surrounding the film, including its authenticity, Alan Moore's reaction to it and its intended political message. The film was intended to be a departure from some of Moore's original themes. In the words of Hugo Weaving: \\"Alan Moore was writing about something which happened some time ago. It was a response to living in Thatcherite Britain ... This is a response to the world in which we live today. So I think that the film and the graphic novel are two separate entities.\\" Regarding the film's controversial political content, the filmmakers have said that the film is intended more to raise questions and add to a dialogue already present in society, rather than provide answers or tell viewers what to think. Books The original graphic novel by Moore and Lloyd was re-released as a hardback collection in October 2005 to tie into the film's original release date of 5 November 2005. The film renewed interest in Alan Moore's original story, and sales of the original graphic novel rose dramatically in the United States. A novelisation of the film, written by Steve Moore and based on the Wachowskis' script, was published by Pocket Star on 31 January 2006. Spencer Lamm, who has worked with the Wachowskis, created a \\"behind-the-scenes\\" book. Titled V for Vendetta: From Script to Film, it was published by Universe on 22 August 2006. Home media V for Vendetta was released on DVD in the US on 1 August 2006, in three formats: a single-disc wide-screen version, a single-disc full-screen version, and a two-disc wide- screen special edition. The single disc versions contain a short (15:56) behind-the-scenes featurette titled \\"Freedom! Forever! Making V for Vendetta\\" and the film's theatrical trailer, whereas the two-disc special edition contains three additional documentaries, and several extra features for collectors. On the second disc of the special edition, a short Easter egg clip of Natalie Portman on Saturday Night Live can be viewed by selecting the picture of wings on the second page of the menu. The film has also been released on the HD DVD high definition format, which features a unique 'in- film experience' created exclusively for the disc. Warner Bros. later released the video on Blu-ray, on 20 May 2008. The film also saw release on Sony's PSP UMD format.V for Vendetta UMD, Amazon.com Reception=Box office By December 2006, V for Vendetta had grossed $132,511,035, of which $70,511,035 was from the United States.

The film was also successful in terms of merchandise sales, with hundreds of thousands of Guy Fawkes masks from the film having been sold every year since the film's release, as of 2011. Time Warner owns the rights to the image and is paid a fee with the sale of each official mask. Critical response On review aggregator Rotten Tomatoes, the film holds a 73% approval rating based on 248 reviews, with an average rating of 6.78/10. The website's critics consensus reads, \\"Visually stunning and thought-provoking, V For Vendetta political pronouncements may rile some, but its story and impressive set pieces will nevertheless entertain.\\" Metacritic, which uses a weighted average, assigned the film a score of 62 out of 100 based on 39 critics, indicating \\"generally favorable reviews\\". Audiences polled by CinemaScore gave the film an average grade of \\"B+\\" on an A+ to F scale. Ebert and Roeper gave the film a \\"two thumbs up\\" rating. Roger Ebert stated that V for Vendetta \\"almost always has something going on that is actually interesting, inviting us to decode the character and plot and apply the message where we will\\". Margaret Pomeranz and David Stratton from At the Movies stated that despite the problem of never seeing Weaving's face, there was good acting and an interesting plot, adding that the film is also disturbing, with scenes reminiscent of Nazi Germany. Jonathan Ross from the BBC blasted the film, calling it a \\"woeful, depressing failure\\" and stating that the \\"cast of notable and familiar talents such as John Hurt and Stephen Rea stand little chance amid the wreckage of the Wachowski siblings' dismal script and its particularly poor dialogue.\\" Sean Burns of Philadelphia Weekly gave the film a 'D', criticising the film's treatment of its political message as being \\"fairly dim, adolescent stuff,\\" as well as expressing dislike for the \\"barely decorated sets with television- standard overlit shadow-free cinematography by the late Adrian Biddle. The film is a visual insult.\\" On Alan Moore removing his name from the project, Burns says \\"it's not hard to see why,\\" as well as criticising Portman's performance: \\"Portman still seems to believe that standing around with your mouth hanging open constitutes a performance.\\" Harry Guerin from the Irish TV network RTÉ states the film \\"works as a political thriller, adventure and social commentary and it deserves to be seen by audiences who would otherwise avoid any/all of the three\\". He added that the film will become \\"a cult favourite whose reputation will only be enhanced with age.\\" Andy Jacobs for the BBC gave the film two stars out of five, remarking that it is \\"a bit of a mess ... it rarely thrills or engages as a story.\\" V for Vendetta received few awards, although at the 2007 Saturn Awards Natalie Portman won the Best Actress award. The film was nominated for the Hugo Award for Best Dramatic Presentation, Long Form in 2007. V was included on Fandomania list of The 100 Greatest Fictional Characters. Empire magazine named the film the 418th greatest movie of all time in 2008. Anonymous Anonymous is a collective international activist/hacktivist collective/movement that is widely known for its various cyber attacks against several governments, government institutions and government agencies, corporations, and the Church of Scientology. As its name denotes, it is not affiliated with the film, book, or author of V for Vendetta, its only link being the use of Guy Fawkes masks as its symbol and modus operandi. Due to its decentralised nature, its political agenda is large and diffuse and its actions and effectiveness vary. Supporters have called the group \\"freedom fighters\\" and digital Robin Hoods while critics have described them as \\"a cyber lynch-mob\\" or \\"cyber terrorists\\". In 2012, Time called Anonymous one of the \\"100 most influential people\\" in the world. Anonymous' media profile diminished in the late 2010s, but the group re-emerged in 2020 to support the George Floyd protests and riots. Political response V for Vendetta deals with issues of totalitarianism, criticism of religion, homosexuality, Islamophobia and terrorism. Its controversial story line and themes have been the target of both criticism and praise from sociopolitical groups. On 17 April 2006, the New York Metro Alliance of Anarchists organised a protest against DC Comics and Time Warner, accusing it of watering down the story's original message in favour of violence and special effects. David Graeber, an anarchist scholar and former professor at Yale University, was not upset by the film. \\"I thought the message of anarchy got out in spite of Hollywood.\\" However, Graeber went on to state: \\"Anarchy is about creating communities and democratic decision making. That's what is absent from Hollywood's interpretation.\\" Film critic Richard Roeper dismissed right-wing Christian criticism of the film on the television show Ebert and Roeper, saying that V's \\"terrorist\\" label is applied in the film \\"by someone who's essentially Hitler, a dictator.\\" LGBT commentators have praised the film for its positive depiction of gay people. Sarah Warn of AfterEllen.com called the film \\"one of the most pro-gay ever\\". Warn went on to praise the central role of the character Valerie \\"not just because it is beautifully acted and well- written, but because it is so utterly unexpected [in a Hollywood film].\\" David Walsh of the World Socialist Web Site criticised V's actions as \\"antidemocratic,\\" calling the film an example of \\"the bankruptcy of anarcho- terrorist ideology;\\" Walsh writes that because the people have not played any part in the revolution, they will be unable to produce a \\"new, liberated society.\\" The film was broadcast on China's national TV station, China Central Television (CCTV) on 16 December 2012 completely uncensored, surprising many viewers. While many believed that the government had banned the film, the State Administration of Radio, Film and Television stated that it was not aware of a ban; CCTV makes its own decisions on whether to censor foreign films. Liu Shanying, a political scientist at the Chinese Academy of Social Sciences who used to work for CCTV, speculated that the showing indicated that Chinese film censorship is getting loosened. Soundtrack The V for Vendetta soundtrack was released by Astralwerks Records on 21 March 2006. The original scores from the film's composer, Dario Marianelli, make up most of the tracks on the album. The soundtrack also features three vocals played during the film: \\"Cry Me a River\\" by Julie London, a cover of The Velvet Underground song \\"I Found a Reason\\" by Cat Power and \\"Bird Gerhl\\" by Antony and the Johnsons. As mentioned in the film, these songs are samples of the 872 blacklisted tracks on V's Wurlitzer jukebox that V \\"reclaimed\\" from the Ministry of Objectionable Materials. The climax of Tchaikovsky's 1812 Overture appears at the end of the track \\"Knives and Bullets (and Cannons too)\\". The Overture's finale is played at key parts at the beginning and end of the film. Three songs were played during the ending credits which were not included on the V for Vendetta soundtrack. The first was \\"Street Fighting Man\\" by the Rolling Stones. The second was a special version of Ethan Stoller's \\"BKAB\\". In keeping with revolutionary tone of the film, excerpts from \\"On Black Power\\" (also in \\"A Declaration of Independence\\") by black nationalist leader Malcolm X, and from \\"Address to the Women of America\\" by feminist writer Gloria Steinem were added to the song. Gloria Steinem can be heard saying: \\"This is no simple reform ... It really is a revolution. Sex and race, because they are easy and visible differences, have been the primary ways of organising human beings into superior and inferior groups and into the cheap labour on which this system still depends.\\" The final song was \\"Out of Sight\\" by Spiritualized. Also in the film were segments from two of Antonio Carlos Jobim's classic bossa nova songs, \\"The Girl From Ipanema\\" and \\"Quiet Nights of Quiet Stars\\". These songs were played during the \\"breakfast scenes\\" with V and Deitrich and were one of the ways used to tie the two characters together. Beethoven's Symphony No.5 also plays an important role in the film, with the first four notes of the first movement signifying the letter \\"V\\" in Morse code. Gordon Deitrich's Benny Hill-styled comedy sketch of Chancellor Sutler includes the \\"Yakety Sax\\" theme. Inspector Finch's alarm clock begins the morning of 4 November with the song \\"Long Black Train\\" by Richard Hawley, which contains the foreshadowing lyrics \\"Ride the long black train ... take me home black train.\\" Television series In October 2017, it was announced that Channel 4 was developing a television series based on the comic book.

Origins In the early days of cellular phone growth, wireless companies were concerned about showing investors a return and profits sufficient to cover the infrastructure costs. Cell phone towers situated in urban areas are typically not attractive and NIMBY neighbors made those costs higher. The carriers needed wide retail exposure and employed a distribution methodology that included making 'Agents' out of car stereo and alarm stores, car washes and other retailers since early cell phones were not mobile and needed to be installed in a vehicle. The advent of portable cell phones in the marketplace in the early 1990s meant more retailers could participate, since installations were not necessary for portable cell phones. Phones were distributed through cell phone wholesalers to these retail agents. Eventually, wireless carriers also began limited distribution of portable cellular phones to their 'agents' and retailers. The original membership 'big box' warehouse company, Price Club, located in San Diego, California, wanted to participate in the cellular phone sales for Price Club members. They contacted a cellular wholesaler, Beau Bennett, a San Diego resident and cellular wholesaler and asked to meet with him to discuss their options. In that subsequent meeting, Mr. Bennett showed Price Club buyers a range of portable cell phones and proceeded to layout a method to retail the phones with cell phone displays in Price Club warehouse stores. When the topic of profits arose, Mr. Bennett explained there were two channels of income related to cell phone service and equipment sales. There were adequate and typical profits on equipment and there was also an option for the retailer to participate in the carriers airtime profit. Airtime contracts could pay certain 'agents' as much as $350 and 7% of the customers monthly service bill for your customers, who signed airtime contracts for 2–3 years of cellular service. Price Club buyers explained that those profits were 'excessive' according to the corporate enshrined profit limits established by Price Club founders. This profit rejection was an issue that needed to be addressed and Price Club buyers asked Mr. Bennett to try and find a way for them to participate. After considering several options, Mr. Bennett eventually choose to form a third party company, called Cellular Order Desk, to provide trained employees located at an inside kiosk just inside the entrance of the first Price Club location, on Morena Blvd., in San Diego, California. The arrangement Mr. Bennett offered included a smaller profit than originally intended, but within Price Club profit limits, for each cell phone sold. Price Club buyers agreed to a one store trial which proved successful and popular with members. Eventually this first store-within-a-store program expanded to 3 additional locations, then to seven locations and eventually to all Price Club stores in Southern California. Price Club and Costco merged in 1993 and the first widely known store-within- a-store concept was expanded to include those additional warehouse locations in Southern California. Trained Cellular Order Desk employees staffed all stores and provided one-stop shopping for members. A customer could enter a Price Club/Costco warehouse location, choose a cell phone model and have it activated and available for pick-up at the Will Call window on the way out of the store. In those days, every cell phone had a programmable NAM which required pairing the phone ESN to the carriers service. Some early phones were programmed with an electronic NAM writer device, but the handsets sold at Price Club/Costco locations were primarily programmed with the cell phone keypad. This agreement is currently popular among filling stations and supermarkets. Many bookshops partner with coffee shops because customers often desire a place to sit and enjoy a drink while they browse. Companies employing this technique include BP/Amoco Sheetz, Exxon Mobil and Hollywood Video with its Game Crazy video-game boutiques. Often the store-within-a-store is an owned by a manufacturer, operating an outlet within a retail company's store. For example, the American department store Bloomingdale's has had such arrangements with Ralph Lauren, Calvin Klein, DKNY and Kenneth Cole. Neiman Marcus, another American department store, has had them with Armani and Gucci. A study by business-school academics found that the arrangement works, because the retailer offers prime locations for which it can charge high rents, the manufacturer makes a higher profit than it would through a wholesale model, and the consumer gets a lower price and better service. The operator of the store-within-a-store can provide these benefits because it receives all profits, instead of having to share them with the retailer, as it would in the traditional split between manufacturer and retailer activities. The study also found that the arrangement works best for relatively non-substitutable goods, like cosmetics and brand fashions.

Diagnosis The pragmatic challenge is to distinguish from aspiration pneumonia with an infectious component because the former does not require antibiotics while the later does. While some issues, such as a recent history of exposure to substantive toxins, can foretell the diagnosis, for a patient with dyphagia the diagnosis may be less obvious, as the dyshagic patient may have caustic gastric contents damaging the lungs which may or may not have progressed to bacterial infection. The following tests help determine how severely the lungs are affected: * Blood gases (measurement of how much oxygen and carbon dioxide are in your blood) * CT scan of chest * Lung function studies (tests to measure breathing and how well the lungs are functioning) * X-ray of the chest * Swallowing studies to check if stomach acid is the cause of pneumonitis Treatment Treatment is focused on reversing the cause of inflammation and reducing symptoms. Corticosteroids may be given to reduce inflammation, often before long-term scarring occurs. Antibiotics are usually not helpful or needed, unless there is a secondary infection. Oxygen therapy may be helpful.

The two men became the first Westerners to be executed under Malaysia's new tougher laws for drug offences that prescribe death for anyone convicted of having over 15 grams of heroin. Barlow was born in the United Kingdom in Stoke-on-Trent and held dual British and Australian nationalities. Barlow's family made appeals to Prime Minister of the United Kingdom Margaret Thatcher to make a protest about the impending execution, and Australian Minister for Foreign Affairs Bill Hayden made an appeal for clemency to the Malaysian government. The executions caused public outcry and strained political relations between Australia and Malaysia at the time. Background Between early 1981 and the end of 1983 Chambers had made at least twelve trips abroad to transport heroin to Australia. In 1980 Chambers imported heroin to Australia using body packing techniques, placing the drugs in his anus. The rest of the load was swallowed. He used the same technique in 1981 when, on transit in Singapore, customs officers detected two vials of personal-use heroin in his jacket pocket. He was released after bribing officers. Chambers and his then girlfriend, Susan Cheryl Jacobsen, decided to move to Melbourne to escape Perth's organised crime scene. Driving intoxicated near Penong, South Australia, Chambers crashed the vehicle. He was not seriously injured; Jacobsen, however, received severe injuries and spent several days in a coma before dying of her injuries on 20 May 1983. Planning The drug run was organised by Perth criminal John Asciak. Chambers was enlisted for the job due to his experience in the task. Asciak spent much time at the residence of his girlfriend Debbie Colyer-Long and got to know her boarder, Kevin Barlow. Asciak soon learned Barlow had little money and few prospects for regular work. At the time Barlow was on compensation after injuring himself at work. He was depressed, consuming a lot of alcohol and marijuana after losing his girlfriend. He had also been threatened with the repossession of his car. Though Barlow and Chambers later testified they were tourists travelling alone who met by chance in Singapore and then opted to travel together, their meeting in Singapore in October 1983 was planned by Asciak. Chambers had previously had a meeting with Barlow in Perth to approve him for the job. To help conceal their activities, Barlow had flown to Singapore directly from Perth, while Chambers had flown there via Sydney. After the Singapore meeting they disobeyed orders by travelling together and sharing the same hotel rooms; they had been directed to stay apart. Barlow was a novice on his first drug run; he was convinced by organisers that as Chambers was an experienced drug courier the plan would proceed smoothly. Barlow was initially confident the drug run would be successful. The proposed drug run had been openly discussed by John Asciak and Kevin Barlow in the household of Debbie Colyer-Long prior to the event. Colyer-Long's brother-in- law Trevor Lawson learned of it and had informed the National Crime Authority of the scheme. Drug trafficking Having met in Singapore, Barlow and Chambers travelled by train to Penang in Malaysia. The package of drugs had been buried on a beach in Penang. Chambers was given directions to the site and dug up the package. Barlow was present but had not known the location of the heroin. Initial plans were that Barlow and Chambers conceal the drugs by inserting some packages into their anuses and swallowing the rest. Barlow refused to do either, the former for reasons of distaste, the latter due to health concerns with that method. Chambers relented and placed the several packages of drugs, which were within plastic carry bags and wrapped in newspaper, into a newly purchased maroon suitcase. Barlow had become very nervous after the collection of the drugs.  Arrest  Barlow and Chambers were observed alighting from the same taxi at Bayan Lepas International Airport on 9 November 1983. Barlow carried the maroon suitcase and entered the airport. He bypassed the luggage scanning area and approached the check-in desk. Chambers, carrying Barlow's bags, paid the taxi, entered the airport and passed through the luggage scanning area, and joined Barlow at the check-in desk. They were detained by police, as Barlow was seen to be very nervous. Taken to an interview room they were asked to open the suitcases. Chambers opened the bags he was carrying. Barlow said he was unable to open the case he had carried and that it was Chambers' case. Chambers unlocked the case's combination locks and the drugs were found; however, he claimed he had not known the contents of the smaller carry bags the drugs were in. When police handcuffed them, they were reportedly \\"shivering terribly\\". Imprisonment on remand They were imprisoned in Penang Prison for all of 1984 and most of 1985. The prison was overcrowded. Built in 1849 to house up to 350 prisoners, in 1984 it housed 2000 people including women and babies. Barlow and Chambers were locked in a two by three-metre cell together with up to three other prisoners for 22 hours a day, with an exercise period being allowed only if all cellmates had behaved that day. Chambers was well liked in prison; however, Barlow had trouble adjusting, and was described as being a \\"lunatic\\" and \\"cracking up\\". Barlow attempted to excuse his actions by claiming that he had been forced to take the trip and his girlfriend threatened to leave him if he refused. Trial Their trial started 17 July 1985 at the High Court of Penang. The trial opened with both men claiming the drugs found in the maroon suitcase belonged to the other. Chambers was represented at the trial by Rasiah Rajasingham and Barlow by Karpal Singh. Chambers remained handcuffed through the trial. Barlow was not cuffed but used crutches due to a groin injury. The arresting officer testified that he saw Barlow holding the maroon suitcase and shivering while waiting to board the plane. The court heard that Chambers had acknowledged ownership of the suitcase two days after the arrest. Chambers testified in court that he didn't know about the drugs in the case, and that Barlow had also used the case. Chambers also testified that Barlow had attempted to bribe a policeman at the airport when the drugs were discovered. On 23 July the judge rejected Singh's attempt to have Rajasingham disqualified on grounds that he had received confidential information from Barlow in the nine months before the trial when he acted for both of the accused. The trial concluded 24 July and both men were found guilty. The trial judge deferred pronouncing sentence for a week to enable lawyers of the two men to prepare submissions to him which might be used in an appeal to the Supreme Court of Malaysia, and to hear submissions on behalf of Barlow that he should be allowed to return to Australia immediately for an operation on his leg. The prosecutors surmised that as they had arrived, stayed, and were leaving together, they had a common purpose of trafficking drugs. On 1 August 1985 Barlow and Chambers attended their sentencing hearing to learn they had received the death sentence by hanging. Police and legal sources confirmed that Chambers at least was the victim of an informer. Prior to his arrest three or four Penang drug dealers had been detained and interrogated about Chambers' movements. The informers' evidence was kept secret at the trial. The drug habits of Barlow and Chambers were likewise not mentioned at the trial as it would have prejudiced their cases, and exposed the heroin trade inside Malaysian prisons. Appeal They sought an appeal against the original sentence on the grounds that the original trial judge had drawn unwarranted inferences from circumstantial evidence and had erred on several points. Other arguments of the appeal revolved around the credibility of the arresting officer's testimony, and questions of whether Barlow and Chambers acted with a \\"common purpose\\" in trafficking in the drugs. On 15 December 1985 they were transferred to Kuala Lumpur for their appeal to the Malaysian Supreme Court. There they were imprisoned in Pudu Prison. Barlow continued to profess his innocence. Pudu Prison had been built in 1895 to hold about 700. By 1986 it held around 6,000 prisoners, almost 50 of whom were drug dealers sentenced to death. The appeal started on 16 December 1985. Chambers was represented at the appeal by Perth barrister Ron Cannon. Barlow's lawyer Karpal Singh was assisted by Melbourne barrister Frank Galbally at the appeal. Galbally was accompanied by Allen Bartholomew who was the Victorian Chief Prison Psychiatrist. On 16 December a row broke out between Singh and Galbally in the court room and was witnessed by press and court staff. The argument occurred after the judges had adjourned for the day and left the court, and lasted for about five minutes. Galbally had urged Singh to file an additional ground for appeal for their client. Singh had said there was \\"little point\\" doing this, as no fresh evidence was involved. Galbally believed Barlow's shivering could be attributed to a spinal injury; however, Singh reasoned that this was already adequately covered by medical evidence at the trial and in the existing appeal. At the appeal Singh had argued that Barlow's shivering could be attributed to his existing medical condition, or a foreigner's \\"unease\\" at being confronted by police. After the argument Singh finally left the room, warning Galbally over his shoulder not to criticise Malaysia's British-based legal system or suggest Australia's was superior. Singh attempted to have Galbally charged with contempt. The day after the row Galbally was asked for, and gave, an apology to the court for his words in court. The appeal court on 18 December 1985 upheld the trial judge's decision to invoke the death penalty because the amount of the drug carried was in excess of the 15 gram cut-off point used to distinguish users from traffickers. On death row, Chambers had taken up biblical studies with a Western Catholic Missionary. He broke down and wept in her arms in the dock when three appeals judges upheld the conviction. Galbally was not in court for the final decision of the appeal; Australian officials reported that he had left Malaysia on the night of 17 December after apologising to the Supreme Court over the row over contempt. After the result was publicised Galbally suggested that Barlow would have been found not guilty had the medical evidence he wanted introduced been admitted by the court. The evidence he wanted heard at the appeal was that Barlow had a nervous shake; the prosecution had used Barlow's shake at the time of his arrest as grounds for his guilt. After the rejection of the appeal, Australia's Foreign Minister Bill Hayden contacted the Governor of Penang asking that the sentence be commuted to imprisonment on humanitarian grounds. Hayden stated that \\"I have always been and remain firmly opposed to capital punishment, and accordingly I will be pressing the presentation of this appeal for clemency with a great sense of urgency.\\" Through the ordeal of Barlow and Chambers, their mothers, Sue Chambers and Barbara Barlow, publicly supported the defence of innocence. However, in a joint letter to the King of Malaysia Sultan Iskandar pleading for their lives, they acknowledged their sons' guilt, saying they \\"regretted their wrongdoing.\\" Execution Barlow and Chambers were hanged in Pudu Prison on 7 July 1986. The executioner was Rajendran Kuppasamy, who retired later that year. Kevin Barlow's mother Barbara Barlow reportedly prepared a suicide potion for her son to enable him to evade death by hanging. She prepared the mixture of 75 sleeping tablets dissolved in gin, whisky and brandy in her hotel room and smuggled it into the prison in a small plastic bottle concealed in her handbag. However, fearing her son would use it before all avenues of appeal had been exhausted she made the last-minute decision to keep the secret solution to herself.  Political statements  Malaysia had introduced the death penalty for drug trafficking in 1983 as a reaction to a burgeoning drug trade in the region. By mid 1986 Malaysia had hanged about 35 people in ten years, mostly Chinese Malaysians convicted of drug trafficking. Lawyers and government officials reportedly agreed that the country risked a political and ethnic outcry if it made exceptions based on the ethnicity of its defendants. As Australian public support for Barlow and Chambers was minimal, Malaysia risked little diplomatic damage from carrying out the execution. Australian Prime Minister Bob Hawke made a passionate plea for a stay of execution on behalf of the two men. Hawke later described the hanging as \\"barbaric\\", a remark which chilled Australian relations with Malaysia. Relations between the two nations were reportedly affected for a decade afterwards. In response to the argument that no one has the right to take another's life, then-Malaysian Prime Minister Mahathir Mohamad replied, \\"You should tell that to the drug traffickers.\\" At a press conference that was held after the hangings Mahathir criticised the use of the word \\"barbaric\\" and said it should not have been used to refer to Malaysia because \\"we have never had any lynchings and things like that which only barbarians like to do.\\" He also said that hanging as a method of executing criminals originated in the West. The then UMNO Youth Leader Anwar Ibrahim also said use of the term \\"barbaric\\" was regrettable. He said \\"It is a generative word that passes judgement on our society—something we cannot accept and did not expect from such a friendly country.\\" He argued that the consequences of drug trafficking were well known in Malaysia, and the need for strong deterrents to eliminate the activity was accepted internationally. The conference of State Legislative Assembly speakers in Shah Alam also rejected Hawke's comment. They said it gave the impression Australia belittled Malaysian law and \\"considers the capital punishment meted out to the two as uncivilised and unsuitable for this day and age.\\" The speakers at the conference unanimously passed an emergency resolution expressing their \\"grave view\\" of the statement. The conference felt that such comments should not have come from a national leader who upheld the law and that the statement had touched on the sovereignty of Malaysia's laws and the legal system.  Aftermath  After their sentencing an investigative trip by Detective Sergeant Carl Mengler of the National Crime Authority of Australia had included interviews with various Australians imprisoned in South East Asia for drug trafficking. Chambers had refused to meet him but Barlow gave information about the planning of the trip; however, he knew only sketchy details of the organisers. This meeting took place in January 1986. The information Barlow gave to Mengler during this interview was later corroborated by Debbie Colyer-Long. Australian Federal Police denied that they had tipped off Malaysian Police about the claims made by Trevor Lawson. In June 1988 in Perth, Western Australia, John Asciak was found guilty of conspiring with Barlow and Chambers to import 179 grams of heroin. He had been implicated by Barlow when he was interviewed in prison by the National Crime Authority of Australia in 1986. The court heard Asciak recruited Barlow, who he knew had financial problems, and offered him $6,000 to conduct the drug run. Barlow was later introduced to Chambers in Perth. Asciak, who denied the charges, was found guilty and sentenced to ten years in prison.  Dramatisations  * A four-hour television mini-series was released in 1988 entitled Barlow and Chambers: A Long Way From Home (Dadah is Death). * A BBC drama, produced by Richard Langridge and directed by Jane Howell, was made on a script by Michael Wall which followed the story closely and was transmitted on BBC2 in 1991 entitled Amongst Barbarians. * A 2004 Canadian movie, Manners Of Dying, follows the short story of that name by Yann Martel (Man Booker Prize winner) published in 1993, directed by Jeremy Peter Allen, refers to the executions through the name of its main character, Kevin Barlow.

The film concentrates on the backroom effort, with less attention paid to the on-field rugby. Even when rugby is shown, it is often cut with the reactions of the coaches on the bench and other backroom staff. The documentary balances pain of various injuries to Rob Howley, Will Greenwood and Doddie Weir, the tensions within the camp (Barry Williams fighting with Mark Regan), the humour of John Bentley's visit to the gym and Keith Wood, and finally jubilation after victory in the second Test. It is largely concerned with events up to the end of the second Test, with the third Test being dealt with via an textual epilogue. Due to its success, a follow-up documentary Living With The Lions 2 - The Final Week was produced. Both films are included in the DVD. Wales and Lions player John Taylor was an Executive Producer on the film. For the 2001 tour to Australia, another documentary was produced. However, the Lions lost that tour, and there were suggestions that it had been censored to edit out the fact that the players (especially Austin Healey) were displeased with the coach, Graham Henry.

Bacevich Jr. ( ); born July 5, 1947) is an American historian specializing in international relations, security studies, American foreign policy, and American diplomatic and military history. He is a Professor Emeritus of International Relations and History at the Boston University Frederick S. Pardee School of Global Studies. He is also a retired career officer in the Armor Branch of the United States Army, retiring with the rank of colonel. He is a former director of Boston University's Center for International Relations (from 1998 to 2005), now part of the Pardee School of Global Studies. Bacevich is the co-founder and president of the Quincy Institute for Responsible Statecraft. Bacevich has been \\"a persistent, vocal critic of the U.S. occupation of Iraq, calling the conflict a catastrophic failure.\\" In March 2007, he described George W. Bush's endorsement of such \\"preventive wars\\" as \\"immoral, illicit, and imprudent.\\" His son, Andrew John Bacevich, also an Army officer, died fighting in the Iraq War in May 2007. Early life and education Bacevich was born in Normal, Illinois, the son of Martha Ellen (née Bulfer; later Greenis) and Andrew Bacevich, Sr. His father was of Lithuanian descent and his mother was of Irish, German, and English ancestry. He graduated from the United States Military Academy at West Point in 1969 and served in the United States Army during the Vietnam War, serving in Vietnam from the summer of 1970 to the summer of 1971. Later he held posts in Germany, including in the 11th Armored Cavalry Regiment; the United States; and the Persian Gulf up to his retirement from the service with the rank of colonel in the early 1990s. His early retirement is thought to be a result of his taking responsibility for the Camp Doha (Kuwait) explosion in 1991 in command of the 11th Armored Cavalry Regiment. He holds a Ph.D. in American Diplomatic History from Princeton University, and taught at West Point and Johns Hopkins University before joining the faculty at Boston University in 1998. Writings Bacevich has described himself as a \\"Catholic conservative\\" and initially published writings in a number of politically oriented magazines, including The Wilson Quarterly. He advocates for a non- interventionist foreign policy. His recent writings have professed a dissatisfaction with the Bush Administration and many of its intellectual supporters on matters of U.S. foreign policy. On August 15, 2008, Bacevich appeared as the guest of Bill Moyers Journal on PBS to promote his book, The Limits of Power. As in both of his previous books, The Long War (2007) and The New American Militarism: How Americans are Seduced by War (2005), Bacevich is critical of U.S. foreign policy in the post-Cold War era, maintaining the United States has developed an over-reliance on military power, in contrast to diplomacy, to achieve its foreign policy aims. He also asserts that policymakers in particular, and the U.S. people in general, overestimate the usefulness of military force in foreign affairs. Bacevich believes romanticized images of war in popular culture (especially films) interact with the lack of actual military service among most of the U.S. population to produce in the U.S. people a highly unrealistic, even dangerous notion of what combat and military service are really like. Bacevich conceived The New American Militarism as \\"a corrective to what has become the conventional critique of U.S. policies since 9/11 but [also] as a challenge to the orthodox historical context employed to justify those policies.\\" Finally, he attempts to place current policies in historical context, as part of a U.S. tradition going back to the Presidency of Woodrow Wilson, a tradition (of an interventionist, militarized foreign policy) which has strong bi-partisan roots. To lay an intellectual foundation for this argument, he cites two influential historians from the 20th century: Charles A. Beard and William Appleman Williams. Ultimately, Bacevich eschews the partisanship of current debate about U.S. foreign policy as short-sighted and ahistorical. Instead of blaming only one president (or his advisors) for contemporary policies, Bacevich sees both Republicans and Democrats as sharing responsibility for policies which may not be in the nation's best interest. In March 2003, at the time of the U.S. invasion of Iraq, Bacevich wrote in the Los Angeles Times that \\"if, as seems probable, the effort encounters greater resistance than its architects imagine, our way of life may find itself tested in ways that will make the Vietnam War look like a mere blip in American history.\\" Bacevich's book American Empire: The Realities and Consequences of US Diplomacy, published in 2004, was highly praised by Professor of International Relations and author Peter Gowan for being \\"a tonic to read: crisp, vivid, pungent, with a dry sense of humour and sharp sense of hypocrisies.\\" Gowan describes Bacevich as a \\"conservative, who explains that he believed in the justice of America's war against Communism, and continues to do so, but once it was over came to the conclusion that U.S. expansionism both preceded and exceeded the logic of the Cold War, and needed to be understood in a longer, more continuous historical durée.\\" Bacevich wrote an editorial about the Bush Doctrine published in The Boston Globe in March 2007. In an article of The American Conservative dated March 24, 2008, Bacevich depicts Democratic Presidential candidate Barack Obama as the best choice for conservatives in the fall. Part of his argument includes the fact that \\"this liberal Democrat has promised to end the U.S. combat role in Iraq. Contained within that promise, if fulfilled, lies some modest prospect of a conservative revival.\\" He also goes on to mention that \\"For conservatives to hope the election of yet another Republican will set things right is surely in vain. To believe that President John McCain will reduce the scope and intrusiveness of federal authority, cut the imperial presidency down to size, and put the government on a pay-as-you-go basis is to succumb to a great delusion.\\" In the October 11, 2009, issue of The Boston Globe, he wrote that the decision to commit more troops to Afghanistan may be the most fateful choice of the Obama administration. \\"If the Afghan war then becomes the consuming issue of Obama's presidency – as Iraq became for his predecessor, as Vietnam did for Lyndon Johnson, and as Korea did for Harry Truman – the inevitable effect will be to compromise the prospects of reform more broadly,\\" Bacevich wrote. In his article \\"Non Believer\\" in the July 7, 2010, issue of The New Republic, Bacevich compared President George W. Bush, characterized as wrong-headed but sincere, with President Obama, who, he says, has no belief in the Afghanistan war but pursues it for his own politically cynical reasons: \\"Who is more deserving of contempt? The commander-in-chief who sends young Americans to die for a cause, however misguided, in which he sincerely believes? Or the commander-in-chief who sends young Americans to die for a cause in which he manifestly does not believe and yet refuses to forsake?\\"Bacevich, Andrew, \\"Non-Believer\\", The New Republic, July 7, 2010. Retrieved 2010-09-05. Referenced in Frank Rich, \\"Freedom's just another word\\", The New York Times, September 4, 2010 (September 5, 2010 p. WK8, NY ed.). In an October 2010 interview with Guernica Magazine, Bacevich addressed his seemingly contradictory stance on Obama. While Bacevich supported Obama during the 2008 presidential race in which Obama repeatedly said he believed in the Afghanistan war, Bacevich has become increasingly critical of Obama's decision to commit additional troops to that war: \\"I interpreted his campaign rhetoric about Afghanistan as an effort to insulate him from the charge of being a national security wimp. His decision to escalate was certainly not a decision his supporters were clamoring for.\\" Regarding nuclear policy in particular, Bacevich noted in The Limits of Power that there is no feasible scenario under which nuclear weapons could sensibly be used and keeping them entails many other risks: \\"For the United States, they are becoming unnecessary, even as a deterrent. Certainly, they are unlikely to dissuade the adversaries most likely to employ such weapons against us – Islamic extremists intent on acquiring their own nuclear capability. If anything, the opposite is true. By retaining a strategic arsenal in readiness (and by insisting without qualification that the dropping of atomic bombs on two Japanese cities in 1945 was justified), the United States continues tacitly to sustain the view that nuclear weapons play a legitimate role in international politics ... .\\"pp. 178-179 Bacevich's papers are archived at the Howard Gotlieb Archival Research Center at Boston University.  Personal life  On May 13, 2007, Bacevich's son, Andrew John Bacevich, was killed in action in Iraq by an improvised explosive device south of Samarra in Saladin Governorate. The younger Bacevich, 27, was a first lieutenant in the U.S. Army, assigned to the 3rd Battalion, 8th U.S. Cavalry Regiment, 1st Cavalry Division. Bacevich also has three daughters.
