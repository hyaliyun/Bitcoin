Raman Skirmunt was born in the village Parechcha in the Pinsky Uyezd of the Minsk Governorate (present-day Pinsk District of Belarus) into the local noble family of the Skirmunts. In early 20th century Skirmunt was among the leaders of the local krajowcy movement and advocated the creation of the Krajowcy Party of Lithuania and White Ruthenia as a common Polish-Belarusian-Lithuanian political organization. In 1906 Raman Skirmunt became a member of the Russian State Duma where he initiated creation of a Polish-Belarusian fraction, the so-called Western Borderlands Group (). Between 1910 and 1911 he was member of the State Council of Imperial Russia. In 1911 he returned to Belarus and worked as leader of the local zemstvo of Minsk. In 1917 Raman Skirmunt was head of the Minsk branch of the Belarusian Society for Assistance to War Victims. In March 1917 he became president of the Belarusian National Committee in Minsk.Biography at slounik.org In April 1917 he led the Belarusian delegation at talks with the Russian Provisional Government demanding autonomy for Belarus. In April 1918 Skirmunt became a member of the Council of the newly proclaimed Belarusian Democratic Republic, in July he became prime minister of Belarus and secretary for foreign affairs. In November 1918 he led the Belarusian diplomatic delegation in Germany and Switzerland seeking international recognition of Belarus. After the Polish- Soviet War and the division of Belarus according to the Riga Peace Treaty, he advocated autonomy for West Belarus within the Second Polish Republic but was not politically active any more, mostly concentrating on his life in his manor. In 1930 he was elected Senator. Raman Skirmunt was killed by locals by the order of the Soviet Commissioner Kholorova after the occupation of Western Belorussia by the Red Army. Ordered to take him and his brother-in-law Boleslaw Skirmunta to Pinsk. Without reaching the city, in the woods, they were stopped, given shovels and ordered to dig their graves. Roman Skirmunt, who at that time was 71 year old, leaned on the tree and said: \\"I did not deserve to myself to dig the grave.\\" Both of them were shot and thrown into the pit, even though they were not lightly powdered. In the neighboring village of Skyrmuntov Molodovo his other nephews were killed. According to historian I. K. Kiryanov Roman Skirmunt was killed by the NKVD. His cousin Konstanty Skirmunt was a notable Polish diplomat and minister of foreign affairs.

In 1930, an even higher Order was established, i.e. the Order of Solomon, which was a split off from the Order of the Seal of Solomon. The Order was conferred on members of imperial house and upon persons who had rendered meritorious services. After the deposition of Haile Selassie and dissolution of the Ethiopian Empire, the order continued as a house order to be awarded by the House of Solomon. Today, its current Grand Master is the President of the Crown Council, Prince Ermias Sahle Selassie, the grandson of Emperor Haile Selassie of Ethiopia.

Grades The Order has five grades. The superior class \\"Collar\\" was introduced in the Order by Empress Zauditu in 1922, but with the amendment in 1930, this grade was separated as independent order by Emperor Haile Selassie (i.e., as the Order of Solomon, with a single class of \\"Collar\\"). *Superior class: ** Collar (separated as independent order in 1930; limited to members of the imperial family and 5 ordinary recipients); *Five ordinary classes: ** Grand Cordon (limited to 15 recipients); ** Grand Officer (limited to 25 recipients); ** Commander (limited to 35 recipients); ** Officer (limited to 45 recipients); ** Chevalier (limited to 55 recipients.

It began south of Alexander at an intersection with Iowa 3 and ended at U.S. Route 18 (US 18) in Clear Lake. The highway was designated in 1920 as a spur route connecting Thornton to US 18, then Primary Road No. 19 (PR No. 19). After Interstate 35 (I-35) was completed through northern Iowa, Iowa 107's role in the primary highway system began to diminish. Portions of the route were removed from the system altogether. In 2003, the majority of the route was turned over to Franklin and Cerro Gordo counties. The only remaining segments were and in length, each segment wholly within the city limits of Meservey and Thornton. After it was discovered that the two segments were still being maintained by the Iowa Department of Transportation, the two communities were asked to accept jurisdiction of the segments. The City of Meservey accepted its section in 2010, and the City of Thornton accepted its section on June 30, 2011. Route description Iowa 107 began at an intersection with Iowa 3 south of Alexander. From Iowa 3, the highway passed through Alexander continued due north along a flat area of northwestern Franklin County. At Meservey, Iowa 107 crossed into Cerro Gordo County. north of Meservey, the highway turned east towards Thornton, splitting from County Road S14 (CR S14). The route's east‚Äìwest jaunt was long. At Thornton, the route turned north again. North of Thornton, Iowa 107 followed a straight highway that traveled over gently rolling hills and only passed a few houses until it reached Clear Lake. At the southern city limit, it intersected CR B35. When the route was nearly removed from the primary highway system in 2003, CR B35 served as the northern end of the route. In Clear Lake, the route skirted the downtown area to east before ending at US 18. History Designated in 1920, Iowa 107 originally was a spur highway connecting Thornton to Primary Road No. 19, now U.S. Route 18 in Clear Lake. In 1935, 107 was extended west and south through Meservey and Alexander to Primary Road 10, now Iowa Highway 3. Between 1935 and 1987, Iowa 107 was a highway. In 1987, the portion of Iowa 107 within Clear Lake's city limits was turned over to the city. Signs on US 18 in Clear Lake were changed to say To Iowa 107. On December 30, 2002, the Cerro Gordo County Board of Supervisors agreed to accept jurisdiction of the portion of Iowa 107 in rural Cerro Gordo County. The Iowa Department of Transportation accepted the transfer on February 18, 2003. The towns of Meservey and Thornton did not accept jurisdictional transfer of Iowa 107. In April 2003, the Iowa DOT drafted a report which identified roadways, including the Franklin County portion of Iowa 107, that would make a more efficient use of Iowa's Road Use Tax Fund if they were classified as secondary roads. Over 600 miles of roads, including the Franklin County portion of Iowa 107 was turned over to local jurisdictions on July 1, 2003. In early 2010, the Cerro Gordo County Engineer sent letters of inquiry to the cities of Meservey and Thornton regarding their interest in taking over their segments of Iowa 107.

Data are collected for both the unloaded and loaded use of power tools. The database was created by the National Institute for Occupational Safety and Health (NIOSH). Purpose This database was created in order to provide information to the general public about the sound and vibrations generated by power tools during their use. Many of these tools produce sound levels high enough to damage hearing if precautions are not taken. Since this information was not readily available in most cases, NIOSH created the Power Tools Database and ran tests on power tools to provide the information. According to NIOSH, the Power Tools Database \\"is particularly helpful in determining the 'real-world' noise level of power tools as they are used on the job.\\"NIOSH Power Tools DatabaseNational Academies, Institute of Medicine, Hearing Loss Research at NIOSH: Reviews of Research Programs of the National Institute for Occupational Safety and Health, Chapter 2 page 59 (National Academies Press, Washington DC) The database is a part of the much larger Hearing Loss Prevention Research Program conducted by NIOSH. The Hearing Loss Prevention Research Program is designed to reduce occupational hearing loss through research and the application of the research to real- world situations.NIOSH Hearing Loss Prevention Program Description This database advances this goal by informing buyers and users of power tools of the dangerous levels of noise and vibrations that they are exposed to while using the tools. By making people aware of how loud power tools actually are, NIOSH is attempting to encourage the design and production of quieter power tools and the proper use of hearing protectors when using such tools. The database is also part of a larger NIOSH prevention initiative called Buy Quiet. In recent years, Buy Quiet programs and initiatives have arisen in an effort to combat occupational noise exposures. These programs promote the purchase of quieter tools and equipment.https://www.cdc.gov/niosh/topics/buyquiet/default.html Noise-induced hearing loss (NIHL) is an increasingly common disorder often caused by work- related activities. Construction, manufacturing, and mining are some of the most susceptible occupations to NIHL, since many workers in these fields are exposed to high levels of noise on a daily basis.http://www.safetyandhealthmagazine.com/articles/9196-complacency-is-real A substantial part of this noise results from the use of power tools, which can produce dangerous levels of noise by themselves.Neitzel R, (2008) \\"How Bad is Construction Noise and What Can Be Done About It?\\" AudiologyOnline 9/22/2008 Although the loudness of power tools may be quite apparent to those using them, the actual level of noise produced was mostly unreported and not available easily in an online reference. This database provides detailed information about these noise levels so that appropriate action may be taken to protect workers from them. Method of testing The information in the database originates from testing done on power tools by NIOSH researchers. Testing is conducted in accordance with ISO 3744 and ANSI S12.15. Calibration of testing equipment is performed before tests begin. Tests are conducted in a semi-anechoic chamber with a test setup that includes a ten-microphone array and an accelerometer. In the case of testing power tools in the unloaded condition, the tool is suspended by cables and set to operate at full speed. For the loaded condition, the tool is used by a researcher to perform the task for which it was designed while another researcher runs the data acquisition programs. After data are collected, they are verified and analyzed before being entered into the NIOSH Power Tools Database. Scope Currently, the NIOSH Power Tools Database contains sound and vibrations data for 166 power tools, including 11 different types of tools from 18 manufacturers. Testing on additional power tools is in progress and the database will be updated to reflect new data acquired. The database is part of NIOSH's Buy Quiet efforts aimed at helping companies buy less noisy equipment that will result in less hearing loss. Other online resources include the \\"Practical Guide,\\" a noise meter showing the length of time when exposure to various everyday noises becomes hazardous,and employee training videos.http://ohsonline.com/articles/2013/06/01/noise-monitoring- resources.aspx ReferencesExternal links *NIOSH Power Tools Database * NIOSH Buy Quiet Topic Page Category:Power tools Category:Construction safety Category:Databases by subject ","title":"NIOSH Power Tools Database"},{"id":"24608400","text":"Thirupathiripuliyur is a neighbourhood of Cuddalore, Tamil Nadu, India.

Principles of Drug Action. The Basis of Pharmacology. Harper and Row, New York, 1968. The principle has wide applicability in pharmacology, physiology, nutrition, biochemistry, and system dynamics. It applies whenever a drug or nutrient is infused or ingested at a relatively constant rate and when a constant fraction is eliminated during each time interval. Under these conditions, any change in the rate of infusion leads to an exponential increase or decrease until a new level is achieved. This behavior is also called an approach to steady state because rather than causing an indefinite increase or decrease, a natural balance is achieved when the rate of infusion or production is balanced by the rate of loss. An especially important use of the plateau principle is to study the renewal of tissue constituents in the human and animal body. In adults, daily synthesis of tissue constituents is nearly constant, and most constituents are removed with a first-order reaction rate. Applicability of the plateau principle was recognized during radioactive tracer studies of protein turnover in the 1940s by Rudolph SchoenheimerSchoenheimer R. The Dynamic State of Body Constituents. Harvard University Press, Cambridge, MA, 1942. and David Rittenberg.San Pietro A, Rittenberg D. A study of the rate of protein synthesis in humans. II. Measurement of the metabolic pool and the rate of protein synthesis. J Biol Chem. 201:457, 1953. Unlike the case with drugs, the initial amount of tissue or tissue protein is not zero because daily synthesis offsets daily elimination. In this case, the model is also said to approach a steady state with exponential or logarithmic kinetics. Constituents that change in this manner are said to have a biological half- life. A practical application of the plateau principle is that most people have experienced \\"plateauing\\" during regimens for weight management or training for sports. After a few weeks of progress, one seems unable to continue gaining in ability or losing weight. This outcome results from the same underlying quantitative model. This entry will describe the popular concepts as well as development of the plateau principle as a scientific, mathematical model. In the sciences, the broadest application of the plateau principle is creating realistic time signatures for change in kinetic models (see Mathematical model). One example of this principle is the long time required to effectively change human body composition. Theoretical studies have shown that many months of consistent physical training and food restriction are needed to bring about permanent weight stability in people who were previously overweight.Chow CC, Hall KD. The dynamics of human body weight change. PLoS Comput. Biol. 4(3):e1000045, 2008. The plateau principle in pharmacokinetics Most drugs are eliminated from the blood plasma with first- order kinetics. For this reason, when a drug is introduced into the body at a constant rate by intravenous therapy, it approaches a new steady concentration in the blood at a rate defined by its half-life. Similarly, when the intravenous infusion is ended, the drug concentration decreases exponentially and reaches an undetectable level after 5‚Äì6 half-lives have passed.Pratt, WB and Taylor P, Principles of Drug Action: The Basis of Pharmacology. Churchill- Livingstone, New York, 1990Okpako, D.T. Principles of Pharmacology: A Topical Approach. Cambridge University Press. 1991. If the same drug is administered as a bolus (medicine) with a single injection, peak concentration is achieved almost immediately and then the concentration declines exponentially. Most drugs are taken by mouth. In this case, the assumption of constant infusion is only approximated as doses are repeated over the course of several days. The plateau principle still applies but more complex models are required to account for the route of administration. Equations for the approach to steady state Derivation of equations that describe the time course of change for a system with zero-order input and first-order elimination are presented in the articles Exponential decay and Biological half-life, and in scientific literature.Berlin CM, Schimke RT. Influence of turnover rates on the responses of enzymes to cortisone. Mol Pharmacol. 1:149, 1965. :C_t = C_0 e^{-k_e t} \\\\, *Ct is concentration after time t *C0 is the initial concentration (t = 0) *ke is the elimination rate constant The relationship between the elimination rate constant and half-life is given by the following equation: :k_e = \\\\frac{\\\\ln 2}{t_{1/2}}\\\\, Because ln 2 equals 0.693, the half-life is readily calculated from the elimination rate constant. Half-life has units of time, and the elimination rate constant has units of 1/time, e.g., per hour or per day. An equation can be used to forecast the concentration of a compound at any future time when the fractional degration rate and steady state concentration are known: :C_t = C_0 + (C_{ss} - C_0)(1 - e^{-k_e t})\\\\, *Css is concentration after the steady state has been achieved. The exponential function in parentheses corresponds to the fraction of total change that has been achieved as time passes and the difference between Css and C0 equals the total amount of change. Finally, at steady state, the concentration is expected to equal the rate of synthesis, production or infusion divided by the first-order elimination constant. :C_{ss}= \\\\frac{k_s}{k_e} \\\\, *ks is the rate of synthesis or infusion Although these equations were derived to assist with predicting the time course of drug action, the same equation can be used for any substance or quantity that is being produced at a measurable rate and degraded with first-order kinetics. Because the equation applies in many instances of mass balance, it has very broad applicability in addition to pharmacokinetics. The most important inference derived from the steady state equation and the equation for fractional change over time is that the elimination rate constant (ke) or the sum of rate constants that apply in a model determine the time course for change in mass when a system is perturbed (either by changing the rate of inflow or production, or by changing the elimination rate(s)). Estimating values for kinetic rate parameters When experimental data are available, the normal procedure for estimating rate parameters such as ke and Css is to minimize the sum of squares of differences between observed data and values predicted based on initial estimates of the rate constant and steady state value. This can be done using any software package that contains a curve fitting routine. An example of this methodology implemented with spreadsheet software has been reported.Hargrove JL, Heinz G, Heinz O. Modeling transitions in body composition: the approach to steady state for anthropometric measures and physiological functions in the Minnesota human starvation study. Dyn Med. 2008 Oct 7;7:16. The same article reports a method that requires only 3 equally spaced data points to obtain estimates for kinetic parameters. Spreadsheets that compare these methods are available.Three-point method explained The plateau principle in nutrition Dr. Wilbur O. Atwater, who developed the first database of food composition in the United States, recognized that the response to excessive or insufficient nutrient intake included an adjustment in efficiency that would result in a plateau. He observed: \\"It has been found by numerous experiments that when the nutrients are fed in large excess, the body may continue for a time to store away part of the extra material, but after it has accumulated a certain amount, it refuses to take on more, and the daily consumption equals the supply even when this involves great waste.\\"Atwater, W.O. The Potential Energy of Food. The Chemistry and Economy of Food. III. Century 1887; 34:397‚Äì405. In general, no essential nutrient is produced in the body. Nutrient kinetics therefore follow the plateau principle with the distinction that most are ingested by mouth and the body must contain an amount adequate for health. The plateau principle is important in determining how much time is needed to produce a deficiency when intake is insufficient. Because of this, pharmacokinetic considerations should be part of the information needed to set a dietary reference intake for essential nutrients. Vitamin C The blood plasma concentration of vitamin C or ascorbic acid as a function of dose attains a plateau with a half-life of about 2 weeks.Levine M, Conry-Cantilena C, Wang Y, Welch RW, et al. Vitamin C pharmacokinetics in healthy volunteers: evidence for a recommended dietary allowance. Proc Natl Acad Sci U S A. 93(8):3704‚Äì9, 1996. Bioavailability of vitamin C is highest at dosages below 200 mg per day. Above 500 mg, nearly all of excess vitamin C is excreted through urine. Vitamin D Vitamin D metabolism is complex because the provitamin can be formed in the skin by ultraviolet irradiation or obtained from the diet. Once hydroxylated, the vitamin has a half-life of about 2 months.Jones G. Pharmacokinetics of vitamin D toxicity. Am J Clin Nutr. 88:582S, 2008. Various studies have suggested that current intakes are inadequate for optimum bone health and much current research is aimed at determining recommendations for obtaining adequate circulating vitamin D3 and calcium while also minimizing potential toxicity.Heaney RP, Armas LA, Shary JR, Bell NH, Binkley N, Hollis BW. 25-Hydroxylation of vitamin D3: relation to circulating vitamin D3 under various input conditions. Am J Clin Nutr. 87:1738, 2008. Phytochemicals in foods and beverages Many healthful qualities of foods and beverages may be related to the content of phytochemicals (see List of phytochemicals in food). Prime examples are flavonoids found in green tea, berries, cocoa, and spices as well as in the skins and seeds of apples, onions, and grapes. Investigations into healthful benefits of phytochemicals follow exactly the same principles of pharmacokinetics that are required to study drug therapy. The initial concentration of any non-nutritive phytochemical in the blood plasma is zero unless a person has recently ingested a food or beverage. For example, as increasing amounts of green tea extract are consumed, a graded increase in plasma catechin can be measured, and the major compound is eliminated with a half-life of about 5 hours.Yang CS, Chen L, Lee MJ, et al. Blood and urine levels of tea catechins after ingestion of different amounts of green tea by human volunteers. Cancer Epidemiol Biomarkers Prev.7:351, 1998. Other considerations that must be evaluated include whether the ingested compound interacts favorably or unfavorably with other nutrients or drugs, and whether there is evidence for a threshold or toxicity at higher levels of intake. Transitions in body composition=Plateaus during dieting and weight loss It is especially common for people who are trying to lose weight to experience plateaus after several weeks of successful weight reduction. The plateau principle suggests that this leveling off is a sign of success. Basically, as one loses weight, less food energy is required to maintain the resting metabolic rate, which makes the initial regimen less effective.Freytag, C. Let's bust that plateau. Prevention magazine, May 2007 The idea of weight plateaus has been discussed for subjects who are participating in a calorie restriction experiment Das SK, Gilhooly CH, Golden JK et al. Long-term effects of 2 energy-restricted diets differing in glycemic load on dietary adherence, body composition, and metabolism in CALERIE: a 1‚Äìy randomized controlled trial. Am J Clin Nutr. 85:1023, 2007. Food energy is expended largely through work done against gravity (see Joule), so weight reduction lessens the effectiveness of a given workout. In addition, a trained person has greater skill and therefore greater efficiency during a workout. Remedies include increasing the workout intensity or length and reducing portion sizes of meals more than may have been done initially. The fact that weight loss and dieting reduce the metabolic rate is supported by research. In one study, heat production was reduced 30% in obese men after a weight loss program, and this led to resistance to further lose body weight.Chaput JP and Tremblay A. Adaptive Reduction in Thermogenesis and Resistance to Lose Fat in Obese Men. The British Journal of Nutrition. 102:488, 2009. Whether body mass increases or decreases, adjustments in the thermic effect of food, resting energy expenditure, and non-resting energy expenditure all oppose further change.Leibel RL, Rosenbaum M, Hirsch J. Changes in energy expenditure resulting from altered body weight. N Engl J Med. 332:621, 1995. Plateaus during strength training Any athlete who has trained for a sport has probably experienced plateaus, and this has given rise to various strategies to continue improving.Ganley, T. Dodging the Dreaded Plateau: Confusing Your Muscles to Make Fitness Gains. Tampa Bay Wellness. Tampa, Florida. June, 2008. Voluntary skeletal muscle is in balance between the amount of muscle synthesized or renewed each day and the amount that is degraded. Muscle fibers respond to repetition and load, and increased training causes the quantity of exercised muscle fiber to increase exponentially (simply meaning that the greatest gains are seen during the first weeks of training). Successful training produces hypertrophy of muscle fibers as an adaptation to the training regimen. In order to make further gains, greater workout intensity is required with heavier loads and more repetitions, although improvement in skill can contribute to gains in ability. When a bodily constituent adjusts exponentially over time, it usually attains a new stable level as a result of the plateau principle. The new level may be higher than the initial level (hypertrophy) in the case of strength training or lower in the case of dieting or disuse atrophy. This adjustment contributes to homeostasis but does not require feedback regulation. Gradual, asymptotic approach to a new balance between synthesis and degradation produces a stable level. Because of this, the plateau principle is sometimes called the stability principle. Mathematically, the result is linear dynamics despite the fact that most biological processes are non-linear (see Nonlinear system) if considered over a very broad range of inputs. Changes in body composition when food is restricted Data from the Minnesota Starvation Experiment by Ancel Keys and othersKeys A, Brozek J, Henschel A, Mickelsen O, Taylor HL. The biology of human starvation. Minneapolis,: University of Minnesota Press; 1950. demonstrate that during food restriction, total body mass, fat mass and lean body mass follow an exponential approach to a new steady state.Alpert SS. A two-reservoir energy model of the human body.Am J Clin Nutr. 32:1710, 1979. The observation that body mass changes exponentially during partial or complete starvation seems to be a general feature of adaptation to energy restriction.Kleiber M. The Fire of Life, An Introduction to Animal Energetics. New York: Huntington: Robert Kreiger; 1975 The plateau principle in biochemistry Each cell produces thousands of different kinds of protein and enzymes. One of the key methods of cellular regulation is to change the rate of transcription of messenger RNA, which gives rise to a change in the rate of synthesis for the protein that the messenger RNA encodes. The plateau principle explains why the concentration of different enzymes increases at unique rates in response to a single hormone. Because each enzyme is degraded with at a unique rate (each has a different half-life), the rate of change differs even when the same stimulus is applied. This principle has been demonstrated for the response of liver enzymes that degrade amino acids to cortisone, which is a catabolic hormone. The method of approach to steady state has also been used to analyze the change in messenger RNA levels when synthesis or degradation changes, and a model has also been reported in which the plateau principle is used to connect the change in messenger RNA synthesis to the expected change in protein synthesis and concentration as a function of time.Hargrove JL, Schmidt FH. The role of mRNA and protein stability in gene expression.FASEB J. 3:2360, 1989. The plateau principle in physiology Excessive gain in body weight contributes to the metabolic syndrome, which may include elevated fasting blood sugar (or glucose), resistance to the action of insulin, elevated low-density lipoprotein (LDL cholesterol) or decreased high- density lipoprotein (HDL cholesterol), and elevated blood pressure. Although obesity by itself is not considered a disease, it increases the risk for Diabetes mellitus type II. Because body mass, fat mass and fat free mass all change exponentially during weight reduction, it is a reasonable hypothesis to expect that symptoms of metabolic syndrome will also adjust exponentially towards normal values. The plateau principle in compartmental modeling Scientists have evaluated turnover of bodily constituents using radioactive tracers and stable isotope tracers.Berman M, Weiss MF, Shawn E. Some formal approaches to the analysis of kinetic data in terms of linear compartmental systems. Biophys J. 2:289, 1962. If given orally, the tracers are absorbed and move into the blood plasma, and are then distributed throughout the bodily tissues. In such studies, a multi-compartment model is required to analyze turnover by isotopic labeling. The isotopic marker is called a tracer and the material being analyzed is the tracee. In studies with humans, blood plasma is the only tissue that can be easily sampled. A common procedure is to analyze the dynamics by assuming that changes can be attributed to a sum of exponentials. A single mathematical compartment is usually assumed to follow first-order kinetics in accord with the plateau principle. There are many examples of this kind of analysis in nutrition, for example, in the study of metabolism of zinc,Wastney ME, House WA, et al. Kinetics of zinc metabolism: Variation with diet, genetics and disease. J. Nutr. 130:1355S, 2000. and carotenoids.Diwadkar-Navsariwala V, Novotny JA, Gustin DM, et al. A physiological pharmacokinetic model describing the disposition of lycopene in healthy men. J. Lipid Res. 44: 1927, 2003. The commonest assumption in compartmental modeling is that material in a homogeneous compartment behaves exponentially. However, this assumption is sometimes modified to include a saturable response that follows Michaelis‚ÄìMenten kinetics or a related model called a Hill equation. When the material in question is present at a concentration near the KM, it often behaves with pseudo first-order kinetics (see Rate equation) and the plateau principle applies despite the fact that the model is non-linear. The plateau principle in system dynamics Compartmental modeling in biomedical sciences primarily originated from the need to study metabolism by using tracers. In contrast, System dynamics originated as a simple method of developing mathematical models by Jay Wright Forrester and colleagues. System dynamics represents a compartment or pool as a stock and movement among compartments as flows. In general, the rate of flow depends on the amount of material in the stock to which it is connected. It is common to represent this dependence as a constant proportion (or first-order) using a connector element in the model. System dynamics is one application of the field of control theory. In the biomedical field, one of the strongest advocates for computer-based analysis of physiological problems was Dr. Arthur Guyton. For example, system dynamics has been used to analyze the problem of body weight regulation.Flatt JP. Carbohydrate-fat interactions and obesity examined by a two-compartment computer model.Obes Res. 12:2013, 2004. Similar methods have been used to study the spread of epidemics (see Compartmental models in epidemiology). Software that solves systems of equations required for compartmental modeling and system dynamics makes use of finite difference methods to represent a set of ordinary differential equations. An expert appraisal of the different types of dynamic behavior that can be developed by application of the plateau principle to the field of system dynamics has been published.Gallaher EJ.

Somme is powered by two SEMT Pielstick 16 PC2.5 V 400 diesel engines turning two LIPS controllable pitch propellers rated at . The vessel has a maximum speed of and a range of at . Somme has two dual solid/liquid underway transfer stations per side and can replenish two ships per side and one astern. The ship initially had capacity for of fuel oil, of diesel fuel, of JP-5 aviation fuel, of distilled water, of provisions, of munitions and of spare parts. These numbers change with the needs of the fleet. The Durance-class tankers all mount a flight deck over the stern and a hangar. The ships utilise A√©rospatiale Alouette III and Westland Lynx helicopters but are capable of operating larger ones from their flight deck. For defence, Somme initially mounted one Bofors 40 mm/L60 anti-aircraft (AA) gun in a single gun turret and two AA guns in a twin turret. The ship is equipped with two DRBN 34 navigational radars. The armament was later altered by removing the 20 mm guns and adding four M2 Browning machine guns and three launchers for Simbad Mistral surface-to-air missiles. The ship has a complement of 162 and is capable of accommodating 250 personnel. Construction and career HMS Northumberland in 2018 The fifth and final tanker of the Durance class was ordered in March 1984 as part of the 1984‚Äì1988 plan. The vessel was laid down on 3 May 1985 by Normed at their yard in La Seyne, France. Named for a river in France, the ship was launched on 3 October 1987 and given the pennant number A 631. Somme was commissioned into the French Navy on 7 March 1990. The Durance-class ships were assigned to the Force d'action navale (FAR, \\"Naval Action Force\\") after entering service. One of the BCRs is assigned to Indian Ocean as flagship of the French naval forces in the region. The ship is home ported in Brest, France. In April 2008, the commander of ALINDIEN, the French command in the Indian Ocean, commanded the strike from Somme that freed the yacht from Somali pirates. Serving as the command vessel for the French forces participating in Operation Atalanta, Somme was attacked approximately off the Somali coast in the night of 6 to 7 October 2009 by two motorboats of Somali pirates who mistook Somme for a civilian ship. Somme repelled the assault rifle attack without sustaining damage or casualties and captured five of the pirates. At the end of 2018, Somme underwent a refit at Brest, returning to service on 5 June 2019. In October 2019, Somme was deployed as part of Operation Corymbe, the French naval mission to the Gulf of Guinea, marking the first time a command ship was deployed there. During the deployment, Somme participated in the African naval exercise Grand African Nemo with 18 African nations.

Berry was sworn into office on December 1, 2009, after defeating incumbent Democrat Martin Ch√°vez. Berry became the first Republican Mayor of Albuquerque in over 30 years.City of Albuquerque. Bio: Mayor Richard J. Berry , City of Albuquerque, September 7, 2012. Early life, education, and business career Richard Berry was born in Waterloo, Iowa on November 5, 1962. He was raised in Nebraska and graduated from Beatrice Senior High School in Beatrice, Nebraska in 1981. Berry moved to Albuquerque in 1982 to attend the University of New Mexico on academic and athletic scholarships (track & field, decathlon). While at the Anderson School of Management, he met his future wife, Maria Medina. Berry graduated with a Bachelor of Business Administration in 1985. After graduating, he became an entrepreneur in the construction industry.

National leadership Berry served as the Chairman of the US Conference of Mayors Metro Economies Committee, as well as an elected member of the Advisory Board. In addition, he served as the Chairman of the Community Leaders of America (CLA) from 2013‚Äì2015. Budgets As Mayor, Berry reduced government spending by over $140 million, while keeping services to the community intact and without layoffs.Griswold, Shaun. Mayor Announces Budget Proposals, KOB, September 7, 2012. In addition, Berry has reduced the size of city government by over 300 positions, through attrition and vacancies. This attrition was made up partially by the 8% reduction in the city's police force during which time the city experienced a spike in violent crimes. Without raising taxes, he has increased the city's operating reserve percentage.Albuquerque Journal. Mayor Berry's Budget A Good Starting Point, Albuquerque Journal, September 10, 2012. Berry initiated an \\"Efficiency, Stewardship, and Accountability\\" program that encourages city employees to report areas of inefficiency or waste in resources, offering a cash incentive to employees to encourage participation. By 2015, the program had saved over $20 million. Other innovations included switching to one provider for insurance, saving of more than $4 million. The city has maintained its \\"AAA\\" S&P; bond rating.Albuquerque Journal Editorial Board. Albuquerque‚Äôs Fuel Wager Is a Good Bet, Albuquerque Journal, September 10, 2012. Education One of Berry's core focus areas is augmenting the existing educational system with smart public sector investments. One way he is doing so is through a program called Running Start for Careers, a nationally recognized apprenticeship and education program. This public-private partnership allows high school students to enroll in a semester-long, dual-credit career exploration class held at industry sites for work-and-learn programs. Participants have higher graduation rates, and the program has served over 1000 local students and the program has maintained a 98% graduation rate. Running Start for Careers was named one of the Top 25 \\"Innovations in Government\\" by the Harvard Ash Center in May 2015. Berry has also committed $100,000 a year to fund six \\"Homework Diner\\" locations. Homework Diner is a grassroots, community-led program that provides after-school tutoring and meal assistance to families. The program addresses two common barriers to education ‚Äì hunger and lack of parental involvement. Homework Diner provides free nutritious meals prepared by culinary students from the Central New Mexico Community College (CNM), and educators stay late to tutor children and help them with their homework. It brings families together around a table with a meal and involves parents in helping their children with their academics. The program's inter-generational approach also includes GED courses for parents who attend. Berry announced that the city will provide approximately $115,000 for an International Baccalaureate (IB) program at Sandia High School, the first program of its kind in the local public school district. The IB diploma program is a world- recognized college prep program for juniors and seniors based on rigorous academic standards. Qualified students from across Albuquerque will be encouraged to participate. APS expects IB to be offered to a junior class of 100-150 students beginning with the 2013-2014 school year.Albuquerque Public Schools.City to Help Fund IB Program at Sandia High , APS, September 10, 2012. Another initiative Berry put into action is TalentABQ, which helps people gain the certifications they need to show prospective employers that they have the skills to do the job and improve productivity in their businesses. The program tests people for free at 35 locations around the City of Albuquerque. In the last two years 14,000 people have decided to be tested to see what job they would be best at, nearly 42,000 assessments have been taken. The city is working with 250 businesses to go into skills based hiring. The City of Albuquerque has 622 people through TalentABQ and the skills-based hiring. Social initiatives In 2011 Berry launched a homelessness aid initiative, called Albuquerque Heading Home. This program provides chronically homeless, medically vulnerable individuals with housing through partnerships with local service providers. Since 2011, 646 individuals and families have been housed through the program. A study by the University of New Mexico found that it was 31% more cost-effective to house chronically homeless, medically-vulnerable individuals through the program than to let them remain on the streets. In August 2013, Berry announced a pay equity taskforce to address gender-based wage and salary inequality. As a result of task force recommendations, in May 2015 the City Council passed a bill supported by Berry that gave incentives to companies bidding for city contracts that can prove that they pay women within 10% of what they pay men in comparable jobs. In 2015, Berry launched the There's A Better Way campaign. The initiative helps to eradicate homelessness in the Albuquerque area. With the help of St. Martin's Hospitality Center, a van goes out in the morning picks up panhandlers and homeless people. They pay the individuals $9 an hour, give them lunch, and then at the end of the day go back to St. Martin's and get invited to engage into programs that may help them to end their homelessness. To date, about 1,200 day jobs have been provided and over 180 people have been connected with some kind of permanent employment opportunities. Through the program about 100,000 pounds of trash and weeds have been cleaned up from about 310 city blocks. Capital improvements Berry's administration completed the $93 million Paseo del Norte and I-25 interchange improvement project. This critical project is shortening commute times for over 56 million drivers a year and is estimated to bring nearly $3 billion in economic opportunity to Albuquerque in the coming decades. Transparency A leader in government transparency, Berry also launched ABQ-View. It allows citizens to easily access city spending data, employee salaries, vendor contracts, capital projects, audits, internal investigations, budget trending, travel expenses, and political contributions. This led to the City of Albuquerque to receive an A+ rating from the Sunshine Review for transparency in both 2011 and 2012.NMFOG announces 2012 Transparency Award winners, National Freedom of Information Coalition, September 7, 2012. To encourage city employees to cut spending and waste, Berry created the Efficiency, Stewardship and Accountability Award. This program allows employees to submit ideas for saving the city money in their own departments. If the idea results in actual savings, the employee's department is eligible for an efficiency bonus. The citizens of Albuquerque have saved over $1.4 million, much of it recurring. A recent ESA example involved identifying annual savings on cell phones of $344,000.Dyson, Stuart.

Public safety Berry's office claims that by stepping up community policing efforts in conjunction with smart policing technology Albuquerque has seen its crime rate drop to the lowest the city has seen in 20 years. Homicide totals, robberies, burglaries, auto theft, and property crime are all down since Berry took office, according to 2012 statistics from the Albuquerque Police Department.Albuquerque Police Department. Annual Reports, Albuquerque Police Department, September 10, 2012. However, media reports contradict some of these statements, with some reports showing an overall rise in violent crime and property crime from 2010 onwards, 2014 ranking as the most violent year for the last five years. Berry and then-Police Chief Raymond Schultz launched a new initiative in 2012 aimed to get more recruits into the police academy. \\"We are looking for the best and brightest,\\" Berry said; \\"We believe these new incentives will attract some of the best law enforcement recruits in our region.\\" The advertising campaign was called, \\"My Mommy and Daddy Are Heroes\\". However, those recruiting efforts have largely been unsuccessful. APD continues to suffer from a significant shortage of new officers and difficulty attracting qualified recruits, as of 2015. Berry has defended APD in several shootings, causing many protests in the city. Berry's platform for police reform and the department's lack of transparency have been met with national scrutiny and criticism. Albuquerque Police Department ‚Äì 2014 US DOJ Report Despite the Albuquerque Police Department's focus on the drop in crime rates, a 2014 Justice Department investigation into APD's practices resulted in a report citing numerous violations of individuals' constitutional rights and finding that the \\"department engages in a pattern or practice of using excessive force during the course of arrests and other detentions in violation of the Fourth Amendment and Section 14141.\\" US DOJ 2014, p. 1 The DOJ report includes specific examples of excessive and unnecessary use of force,US DOJ 2014, pp. 18‚Äì20 from a random sample of 200 force reports during Mayor Berry's term between 2009‚Äì2013 and includes recommendations for revising department policies and practices US DOJ 2014, p. 41 The report was submitted to Mayor Berry, APD Chief Gordon Eden, and Albuquerque City Attorney David Tourek on April 10, 2014.http://www.justice.gov/crt/about/spl/documents/apd_findings_4-10-14.pdf website=justice.govaccessdate=May 9, 2015 The report also notes that \\"Albuquerque police officers also often use less-lethal force in an unconstitutional manner\\" and that \\"The use of excessive force by APD officers is not isolated or sporadic. The pattern or practice of excessive force stems from systemic deficiencies in oversight, training, and policy. Chief among these deficiencies is the department‚Äôs failure to implement an objective and rigorous internal accountability system. Force incidents are not properly investigated, documented, or addressed with corrective measures.\\"US DOJ 2014, pp. 9‚Äì10 As of May 2015, more than a year after the DOJ report, APD's website does not outline any specific policy changes, or otherwise respond to the report, although it does provide a link.

Dick, first published in the September 1953 issue of Beyond Fantasy Fiction. Plot summary Shadrach Jones is an old man who owns and runs a gas station in the fictional town of Derryville, Colorado, along an old highway fallen into disrepair due to it having been replaced by a modern interstate highway. One night he counts the money he made that day and realizes that although his income is meager, it is enough to sustain a humble lifestyle that suits him. He then looks outside and sees sickly elves standing in the rain in front of his store. He invites them inside his home to comfort them and learns that they are an army with their king, who is ill and needs rest. They tell him that they are at war with trolls. Shadrach allows them to sleep in his bedroom while he sleeps in his living room. During the night, Shadrach feels foolish for believing in the existence of elves, and goes to check on them. He finds that the King of the Elves has died in his bed, but his last command to his subjects was that they should have Shadrach be the new King of the Elves, and have him lead them into battle against the trolls. Shadrach looks in the mirror and sees his aged face; immediately he thinks to tell his friend Phineas Judd of his royal status. The next day Shadrach tells Phineas that he is king, and by the end of the day the local community has all heard this news. Away from Shadrach, they question among themselves whether he actually believes that he is king, and why he would say this, and whether he is trying to get more customers for his gas station. That night, a messenger elf comes to Shadrach and tells him that he must help his staff develop battle plans against the trolls at a meeting tonight under the oak tree on Phineas‚Äô property. Shadrach thinks of his dinner, of being ready to serve customers the next day, and of the opinions of his human peers, and suggests that the elf choose a different person to be king. Still, he commits to attend the meeting. When he goes to attend at the appointed time the cold weather bothers him and on the way he passes Phineas at his home. When Phineas invites him inside for a short while, Shadrach gets comfortable inside and forgets his commitment as they reflect on their long friendship. At Phineas' advice Shadrach decides to return home to be warm and comfortable. As Phineas takes Shadrach outside, Shadrach realizes in the moonlight that Phineas is an inhuman, beastly troll. Phineas attacks Shadrach as legions of trolls pour from the shadows. Shadrach calls for help and attacks trolls as best he can while elves rush to his rescue. In the end, Shadrach has fought effectively and killed many trolls, including Phineas. The elves reveal Phineas to be the Great Troll, and are awed that he is defeated. With the trolls routed, Shadrach expresses a desire to return to his life as a gas station attendant, and the elves respect this. But after seeing his dilapidated home and gas station, he reconsiders, and accepts the status of King of the Elves. Possible Film adaptation In April 2008, Walt Disney Animation Studios announced a 3D animated feature film adaptation, titled King of the Elves. The film was originally to have been directed by Aaron Blaise and Robert Walker (directors of Brother Bear), and produced by Chuck Williams. Originally slated for release in 2012, the film was reported as shelved in December 2009. By July 2010, King of the Elves had gone back into development and it was being directed by Chris Williams, director of Bolt. About a year into Williams' effort, he decided that this was not the film he wanted to make and left the project.

Desaxe engines are usually automotive, but the term can also apply to steam engines. Scuderi Split Cycle Engine. If the offset is in the direction of rotation, it has the effect of increasing the leverage applied to the crankshaft during the \\"power\\" stroke, and reducing thrust wasted against the cylinder wall. In a conventional four- stroke engine, each of the strokes (intake, compression, power, exhaust) involves a nominal rotation of 180¬∞, totaling 720¬∞ for the complete 4-stroke combustion cycle. A desaxe engine adds to the duration of the two downward strokes (intake and power), and subtracts the same amount from the two upward strokes (compression and exhaust), with the total remaining 720¬∞. A typical desaxe engine will have strokes of 185¬∞ - 175¬∞ - 185¬∞ - 175¬∞, etc., with the differential roughly (but not directly) proportional to the percentage of offset distance to stroke length. The relative proportion of offset distance versus stroke length ranges from very small to almost 20%; viz. an engine with an 80 mm stroke may have a cylinder offset of 20 mm. Early adopters of the Desaxe Principle included Henry Ford who would fully implement the Desaxe offset into the Ford Flathead V8 engine throughout the 1930s while adopting greater offsets into the 1940s. Use of desaxe engines is now becoming more common.. The Volkswagen VR6 & VR5 engines have desaxe cylinders, with an offset of 12.5 mm. The front bank cylinders are offset forward of the crank while the rear are offset rearward. The Toyota Prius has desaxe cylinder bores offset by 13 mm. The new MT-09 motorcycle is the first Yamaha with desaxe pistons. Ford has a new series of engines called dragon series that have an offset crank shaft. All single crank split-single engines such as those used by DKW and Puch had, by necessity, highly desaxe cylinders. The Scuderi engine, as shown in the animated illustration, has highly desaxe cylinders. The compressor (blue) is offset a greater amount than the power cylinder (yellow). Its benefit is to give a better line of thrust from piston to crank though con-rod during downward power stroke but it has disadvantages in vibration and bore wall thrust.

He claimed to be a former occultist who was born into a 'witchcraft family' before converting to Christianity. He was a primary source for many Chick Publications works against Dungeons & Dragons, Catholicism, Neopaganism, and Christian rock. In his public appearances, Todd made a variety of claims about witches, Satanists, and the Illuminati, who he alleged were conspiring against Christians. These purported conspiracies often included government officials and leaders of Christian organizations. Investigative reports in magazines and books said there were many inconsistencies in his statements about anti- Christian conspiracies and his own past. In 1988 Todd was convicted in South Carolina on charges of rape and sentenced to 30 years in a prison. In 2004 he was released from prison and placed in a psychiatric facility, where he died in 2007. Biography=Speaking career Todd's earliest known public speaking engagements began in 1968, when he was preaching and married to a woman named Linda. He claimed he had been a witch while in the United States Navy, but converted to Christianity while visiting a southern Californian Pentecostal church. After disappearing from public sight for a few months, Todd returned without his wife, saying that God told them to seek other mates. In 1969, Todd joined the United States Army and was stationed in Germany for a few months before being discharged for psychiatric reasons and drug abuse. In 1972 Todd became associated with a Jesus Movement coffeehouse. In 1973, he appeared on a local Christian television show in Phoenix, Arizona, and was invited by evangelist Doug Clark to appear on his Amazing Prophecies show on the Faith Broadcasting Network. However, allegations surfaced that he had been making sexual advances toward young women and teenage girls at the coffeehouse, was incorporating witchcraft teachings into his Bible studies, carrying a .38 caliber handgun into church meetings, and using drugs. In addition, he impregnated his wife's teenage sister. Todd was dismissed from the coffeehouse ministry, and Clark denounced him on his television show. In 1974 Todd moved to Dayton, Ohio, where he opened an occult bookstore and began recruiting for a Wiccan coven. In 1976 Todd became the subject of a criminal investigation over reports that he was involving underage girls in sexual initiation rituals for his coven. Following an investigation of his activities by neopagan leaders Isaac Bonewits and Gavin Frost, which uncovered drug use and underage sex, Frost's Church and School of Wicca revoked the charter it had granted to Todd's coven. He was convicted of contributing to the delinquency of a minor and given a six-month sentence, but served only two months before being released due to epileptic fits. Todd resurfaced in the evangelical Christian community in late 1977, this time claiming the existence of a vast Satanic conspiracy led by an order of witches called the Illuminati, supposedly including a number of Christian organizations and well-known Christian figures such as Jim Bakker, Jerry Falwell, Billy Graham, Bob Jones, Sr., Oral Roberts, and Pat Robertson. He claimed to have given, as a member of the Illuminati, $8 million to Pastor Chuck Smith of Calvary Chapel to launch the Christian rock industry, which Todd said was a Satanic invention to entrap Christian young people in rock music and its \\"demonic beat\\". He claimed that Falwell had been bribed by the Illuminati with a $50 million donation. He also claimed that US President Jimmy Carter was the Antichrist and that Ayn Rand's 1957 novel Atlas Shrugged was the Illuminati's blueprint for unleashing a planned Satanic takeover. He urged Christians to stockpile weapons and food in preparation for a Satanic takeover in 1980. Tapes from Todd around 1979 indicate that he was then teaching Oneness Pentecostal (sometimes called \\"Jesus Only\\") theology. Todd significantly curtailed his public speaking after 1979, reportedly moving to rural Montana after issuing warnings that the Satanic takeover had begun. He was later reported to have delivered a speech in Cedar Falls, Iowa in 1983 at the invitation of Randy Weaver. Later life Todd was arrested in May 1987 for the rape of a University of South Carolina graduate student. After his arrest, he was additionally charged with sexually molesting two children who attended a karate school where he worked. He was convicted of the rape in January 1988 and sentenced to 30 years in state prison. In June of 1988, Todd, through his defense attorney, requested the return of a pair of pink women's panties, 64 photographs, two survival knives, a knife sharpener, a handgun, 99 cassette tapes and three copies of Todd's book 'How to Build an Ark: A Practical Guide to Survival'. Convicted rapist seeks return of panties, pictures UPI Archives. June 29, 1988. Accessed online October 6, 2020 In 2004, Todd was released, but he was put in the care of the Behavioral Disorder Treatment Unit run by the South Carolina Department of Mental Health. Claims and reactions Todd claimed to have served as a Green Beret in the Vietnam War, but his discharge papers list him as a general clerk/typist and do not record him having been in Vietnam. Army medical reports referred to \\"emotional instability with pseudologica phantastica\\" (compulsive lying), difficulty in telling reality from fantasy, homicidal threats he had made on another, false suicide reports, and a severe personality disturbance. Todd also claimed in his testimony to have murdered an officer in Germany and to have escaped prison with the help of the Illuminati, but his records show no such things occurred. These records were later recovered by investigative journalists working for Christianity Today, who found that he had never been to Vietnam. One report concluded that Todd found it difficult to distinguish reality and fantasy. Todd also claimed that John F. Kennedy was still alive and that he had been Kennedy's \\"personal warlock\\". While Todd claimed to have left witchcraft in 1972 and converted to fundamentalist Christianity, accounts have him being baptized into a Oneness Pentecostal church in Phoenix, Arizona in 1968, and leading a Wiccan group in Ohio in 1976. When confronted with the latter by Christian evangelists, Todd said that he had gone through a period of \\"backsliding\\" during that time. However, when a number of other inconsistencies in Todd's story were reported in the evangelical Christian media, and Todd began denouncing many Christian leaders as part of the Satanic conspiracy or the Illuminati, many evangelists denounced Todd and cut off any further association. Jack Chick was the only influential evangelist to continue to defend Todd. Todd's speaking engagements during 1978 and 1979 generated controversy and sometimes hysteria at the churches he spoke at. Frequently, there were claims by Todd of gunshots in the parking lot or attacks on his life after the services, but there were no witnesses to confirm his claims. Several Christian organizations and publications investigated Todd's claims and published articles disputing them. These included Cornerstone magazine, the Christian Research Institute, Christianity Today magazine, and the book The Todd Phenomenon by Darryl E. Hicks. Similarities to other preachers Todd was not the only speaker making the rounds in evangelical Christian circles in the 1970s warning young people against the occult. Todd's claims of being a Satanic high priest before his conversion were similar to claims by Hershel Smith and Mike Warnke. In one meeting between Todd and Warnke, the two had a backstage confrontation and Todd accused Warnke of stealing his testimony regarding the Illuminati. Publications based on Todd's claims Todd has appeared in several of Jack Chick's publications. Chick first promoted Todd's message in comic form in The Broken Cross, a comic that portrays a town controlled by organized Satanists, who ignore ritual murders and teach witchcraft to children in school. In another Chick comic book, Spellbound?, a character called \\"Lance Collins\\" describes himself as a former druid and member of the Illuminati. The character claims that Satanists control the rock music industry and are infiltrating churches, and urges Christians to burn their rock music records, Ouija boards and Dungeons & Dragons game sets. Both comics offer \\"deepest appreciation to John Todd, ex-grand Druid priest\\". Todd's stories about the Illuminati were published as the comic book The Illuminati and Witchcraft in 1980 by Jacob Sailor. His claims partially became the basis for a different book, Witchcraft and the Illuminati, published in 1981 by The Covenant, The Sword, and the Arm of the Lord, a Christian Identity group, and reprinted in 1999 by the Christian Patriot Association. This book repeated many of Todd's claims, including the alleged power structure of the Illuminati and the idea that Atlas Shrugged was the Illuminati's secret blueprint, but added Identity beliefs derogatory toward Jews and African-Americans. After Todd's veracity was questioned and investigated, Chick continued to defend him and publish tracts based on Todd's life. Author Cynthia Burack wrote that Chick often made \\"excuses for behaviours that were inconsistent with Todd's status as a high- profile Christian convert,\\" and that his \\"propensities to indulge in conspiracy theory and to lash out at putative allies who question his conclusions\\" in his defense of Todd and other controversial figures (namely Alberto Rivera and Rebecca Brown) resulted in a split between himself and the conservative Christian movement.

Within a few years, the 12\\" album was the format offered to the record buying public, remaining so until the mid-1980s when the Compact Disc took the market by storm. Shirley Bassey had been signed, a year earlier, to Philips by Johnny Franz and had released three singles which failed to chart, including her debut recording \\"Burn My Candle (At Both Ends)\\". But 1957 would bring her first chart success with the top ten hit \\"The Banana Boat Song\\". Philips were not certain to which market Shirley Bassey should be directed. They had recorded her singing Great American Songbook standards, novelty songs and even the blues. The opening track from the album, the only one previously released, is the title song \\"Born to Sing the Blues\\". This track was one of the three singles issued in 1956, as the B-side of \\"The Wayward Wind\\". After a successful live performance of the song on British television, John Franz decided to present her in an album of traditional blues songs. Several of the compositions that appeared on the album were written by W.C. Handy, known as \\"Father of the Blues\\". The recordings appear here in mono, no stereo versions are known to exist. In the 1970s Philips did re-issue them in an \\"electronically enhanced\\" stereo (also known as \\"pseudo-stereo\\"), but these added echoes proved unpopular, and these versions have not been re-released. For many years the recordings made by Bassey at Philips were not generally available on CD. Since the late 2000s they have fallen into the public domain and in the past few years, several compilations have been released on CD.

It is located along the western shores of the L'Assomption River. History Sainte-M√©lanie was formerly part of the territory of the Ailleboust Seignory, granted to Jean d'Ailleboust d'Argenteuil (1694-1785) in 1736. By 1800, Pierre-Louis Panet (1761-1812) was Lord of Ailleboust, whose daughter Charlotte-M√©lanie Panet (1794-1872) may have been the source of the name Sainte-M√©lanie, also a reference to Melania the Younger (383-439). Charlotte-M√©lanie's husband, Marc- Antoine-Louis L√©vesque (1782-1833), donated the land in 1814 for a chapel that was eventually built in 1830. The Parish of Sainte-M√©lanie was founded in 1832, and four years later in 1836, the post office opened under the name Daillebout.

It is located on Highway 49, approximately northeast of Grande Prairie, and has an elevation of . It was established on the banks of the Smoky River, downstream from its confluence with the Little Smoky River. The name Watino is derived from the Cree word \\"Wa-ye-te-naw\\", meaning \\"valley\\". When the Edmonton, Dunvegan and British Columbia Railway began to construct a railway bridge over the Smoky River in 1915, two temporary hamlets sprang up on either side of the river. On the east bank was the main railway camp, called Pruden's Crossing, and on the west, connected by a small cable ferry, was the hamlet of Smoky River, or \\"Old Smoky\\". The railway bridge was erected in 1916, and a railway siding situated on the west bank. It was here that Carl Donis opened the first post office, named Prudens Crossing, in 1917. The community was renamed Watino in 1921, and the post office name changed to the same in November 1925 . Eventually Watino contained a school, two grocery stores, two hardware stores, post office, three machine agencies, garage, grain elevator, restaurant, pool hall, community hall, and skating rink . There was also a railway station, a pump station, and coal dock for the steam trains, and stockyards on the railway, from which Egg Lake Ranch shipped 13 carloads of cattle to Chicago in 1920. The railway was the main mode of transportation until 1938, when the bush trail into the community was replaced by a highway and a connecting ferry over the Smoky River. In 1950, the establishment of the Park Brothers sawmill and planer made Watino boom. Watino declined in the 1970s and 1980s. In 1972, the Smoky River flooded, washing away much farmland in the valley, and in 1975 the grain elevator was removed. In 1987 another flood caused heavy damage to the east and west sides of the railroad bridge and forcing the closure of the CNR train system through Watino.

The company publishes free-to- play games for iPhone, iPad and Android devices. The company also publishes games for the web and Facebook.  History  Spill Group was formed by two Dutch entrepreneurs Peter Driessen and Bennie Eeftink in 2001. The first online games website was launched in 2004, in the Dutch market. At this time, the target audience was mostly teenager girls. In 2007 Spill Group acquired a majority share in the Chinese game development company zLong and began producing games. In 2007, portals were also expanded to the US and UK. The 2008 acquisition of the MMO (massive multiplayer online) site/community, onrpg.com, moved the company into the MMORPG segment. In July 2008, Spill group changed the company name and rebranded to Spil Games. In total, Spil Games expanded its segmented and localized approach with more than 50 websites where people can play games online in 20 languages. In May 2014 the company announced that it will let go of a substantial portion of its workforce ‚Äì 90 out of 240 full-time positions ‚Äì as a result of a move from website to mobile and tablet games. In September 2014, the company reorganised, closing its Dutch development studio and concentrating on mobile game publishing.  Turnaround  In February 2015, a new CEO was appointed. Tung Nguyen-Khac had been CEO of the gaming division of the German television company ProSiebenSat1. Venturebeat said of the move: \\"With the mobile-gaming industry growing to $25 billion in 2014, it's not surprising that a company like Spil would look for new leadership to help get a bigger piece of that action.\\" On 16, August, 2016 Spil Games announced it achieved 100 million downloads in the last 12 months. PocketGamer said of the announcement that Spil \\"had originally hoped to reach this milestone by the end of 2016, and has now revised its goal up to 150 million for the end of the year\\" By February 2017, the company had achieved 200 million mobile downloads. This grew to 250 million by July 2017. The company announced it hit 300 million installs in March 2018 with the growth being 95% organic. VentureBeat stated this is, \\"a testament to the company's method of testing titles on the web and then reposting the most popular titles as mobile apps. On 24 May 2018, it was announced Spil's COO Timm Geyer had been named the company's new CEO. As reported by PocketGamer.biz his focus will be building on Spil's strategy of bringing its most successful web IPs to mobile. On 19 June 2019, the mobile division of Spil Games was bought by Azerion, though the price is secret. The most popular game Trollface Quest Video Games was updated on 23 August 2019 with the new Azerion logo, completely replacing the Spil Games branding which was last available from the day before. Spil Games has continued to operate independently with a focus on its portal business.  New games  In the first part of 2016, the company announced and launched several game brands. In February 2016, it purchased the rights to the classic game Creatures In April 2016, Atari founder Nolan Bushnell announced that he would be working with Spil to develop several new mobile games. In May 2016, Spil Games acquired the browser game portal Mousebreaker. Europacorp, Luc Besson's film studio, selected Spil Games to create the official mobile game for Valerian and the City of a Thousand Planets, the director's upcoming $180M sci-fi movie. The company revealed the first details about the game in May 2017. Facebook chose Spil Games as a launch partner for Instant Games on 29 November. Spil's Endless Lake is one of 17 games to be featured in Instant Games where players can play games directly on Messenger or their Facebook News Feed. Three weeks later Facebook named Endless Lake as on its Games of the Year. Spil Games launched its second Instant Games, Tomb Runner, in April 2017. In May 2017, Spil Games launched Operate Now: Hospital a hospital simulation game for iOS and Android. The game exceeded 10 million installs in 6 months. Spil Games published Mahjong Crimes in November 2017; a new game bringing together Mahjong solitaire and the murder mystery Murder on the Orient Express by Agatha Christie.  Audience  In mobile, the company started from nowhere and had 50 million installs in 2015. By February 2017, the company had achieved 200 million mobile downloads. In March 2018 the company hit 300 million installs. Installs are driven by games like the Troll Face Quest series, which has racked up 100 million installs, Uphill Rush, which has garnered 25 million downloads, and Operate Now: Hospital, which has 15 million. Its games are also beginning to reach significant social and messenger audiences on Instant Games from Facebook.

Modern ultrasonic diagnostic medical scans are descendants of the equipment Wild and his colleagues developed in the 1950s. He has been described as the \\"father of medical ultrasound\\". Early life and education Wild was born in Kent, England.

Ultrasound Wild emigrated to the United States in 1946, taking a position at the University of Minnesota. After starting at the school's department of surgery, he shifted to the electrical engineering department in 1950. As a surgeon during World War II he had seen many patients who had suffered bowel failure experienced because of bomb explosions from German V-1 flying bombs and had developed a technique called the \\"Wild tube\\" to deal with the problem. After seeing patients in the U.S. with similar conditions, Wild conceived the idea of using ultrasound as a noninvasive means to determine the level of injuries suffered in the intestines of patients, with the sound bouncing back from the tissue identifying the thickness and resiliency of that portion of the intestine. He had developed the technique after having heard of high-frequency sounds being used as a means to identify cracks in tank armor. While the early machines operated at too low a resolution for the purpose of scanning the intestines, by 1951 he and Dr. John Reid gained access to equipment that operated at the 15 MHz range, providing the detail needed to scan internally and to distinguish between healthy and cancerous tissue. Wild and his team were able to take ultrasound scans of breast tissue that could be used as a noninvasive means to identify and diagnose tumors. Together with Reid, Wild developed tools for scanning rectal and vaginal tissues. Their work was published in the journal The Lancet in March 1951 and in Science in March 1952. Wild and Reid stated that they planned the \\"immediate application of echography to the detection of tumors in accessible sites in the living intact human organism\\" through the process of \\"record[ing] soft tissue structure by tracing the information obtained from a sound beam sweeping through the tissues onto a fluorescent television screen\\". They were credited in Diagnosis of Diseases of the Breast as \\"the first to develop equipment specifically designed for breast scanning\\", as well as \\"the first to differentiate between cystic and solid masses in the breast by means of ultrasonography\\". Wild earned the 1991 Japan Prize, with a cash prize of 10 million yen (then approximately US$370,000), in recognition for his innovations in the field of ultrasound imaging.Staff. \\"ST.

Biography = Early life  Sibley was born in Great Barrington, Massachusetts, on April 1, 1782, the son of Dr. John and Elizabeth Sibley. Due to his father's frequent travelling, early childhood for Sibley was spent living with his Puritan grandfather, Samuel Hopkins, in Rhode Island. Later on, Sibley moved with his mother to Fayetteville, North Carolina, where he received his education and apprenticed as a bookkeeper in the counting house of John Winslow.  Fort Bellefontaine  In 1805, through his correspondence with President Thomas Jefferson, Sibley's father was appointed as an Indian agent for the U.S. government in Natchitoches, Louisiana. George Sibley used his father's acquaintance with President Jefferson to get a position as assistant factor at Fort Bellefontaine at the mouth of the Missouri River near St. Louis, Missouri. Problems arose in 1807 between Sibley and the factor of Fort Bellefontaine, Rudolph Tillier, when Sibley questioned Tillier's bookkeeping methods. Disagreements grew between the two, to the point that Tillier fired Sibley. To defend himself, Sibley immediately undertook a trip to Washington, DC to give his side of the story.  Fort Osage  Sibley was cleared of wrongdoing because of his good reputation among friends William Clark and Acting Governor Frederick Bates. Consequently, Sibley was then given the position of factor at Fort Osage in western Missouri, near present-day Kansas City, Missouri, in 1808. While at Fort Osage, Sibley quickly engaged in creating relationships with the neighboring Osage tribes.http://www.fws.gov/refuges/profiles/index.cfm?id=21630 In 1811, he led an expedition, known as the George C. Sibley Expedition, to improve relations with the Pawnee and Kansa tribes, and also to locate the rumored Jefferson's salt mountain. Instead, he found it in the Salt Plains in northwest Oklahoma. He kept several journals of his travels, but never published them.http://www.forttours.com/pages/mohgeorge.asp Once the War of 1812 began, Sibley briefly moved back to St. Louis because it was feared that the British would entice the local Native American tribes to attack Fort Osage. This, however, lasted briefly, because the Osage tribes complained about having to travel the extra distance to St. Louis for their trade goods. As a result, in 1813, Sibley opened a temporary trading post in Arrow Rock, Missouri, for the duration of the war. While stationed at Fort Osage, in 1815, Sibley married Mary Easton, the daughter of prominent St. Louis attorney and Missouri's second attorney general, Rufus Easton. Sibley maintained this post until 1822, when the United States decided to formally end its Indian trade system. By this time, most of the Native Americans had been resettled outside of Missouri. After the trading post closed in 1822, George and Mary remained at Fort Osage, where he served as postmaster until the fort closed in 1825.  Santa Fe Trail  Around this time, trade between the United States and the Mexican government in Santa Fe was growing significantly. Consequently, Missouri Senator Thomas Hart Benton presented a petition to Congress to fund a survey of the road to Santa Fe. Congress granted this request, and soon after, George Sibley was put in charge of the expedition. Until this time, travelers between Missouri and Santa Fe periodically were raided by Indians along the way, so in addition to surveying the road, Sibley was required to negotiate treaties for safe passage along the route. The tasks for this assignment lasted between 1825 and 1827.  Linden Wood years  Once Sibley was finished, his wife Mary and he moved to St. Charles, Missouri, where he had owned land since 1814. Between 1827 and 1829, the Sibleys lived in town until the property that George owned could be cleared and a residence built. During this same time, Mary, who had been recorded as having taught children at Fort Osage, began teaching her sister, along with a few local children, in their home on a private basis. Mary‚Äôs career as an educator developed into The Linden Wood School for Girls, later known as Linden Wood College, and today known as Lindenwood University. By 1831, George had built a log cabin on their property and over the years expanded the structure as enrollment at the boarding school grew to over 20 women being taught by his wife. George had a limited role with the school, while Mary served as the school's lone headmaster and education, George helped Mary with the maintenance on and additions to the property and cabin and also produced the advertising and most of their correspondence. George remained active in public life. In 1833, Sibley ran as a Whig for U.S. Congress, but pulled out of the race at the last moment. Between 1839 and 1840, Sibley served as president of the Missouri Internal Improvements Board and as a railroad commissioner, and in 1844, he ran for a seat in the Missouri Senate, but lost. Privately, Sibley was very active with the Old School Presbyterian church. Through this involvement he became closely acquainted with abolitionist Elijah Lovejoy. Lovejoy, whose in- laws lived in St. Charles, visited the region often. On one occasion in 1837, after increasingly irritating area slave owners with his stories in the Alton Observer, an angry mob tried to lynch Lovejoy. Lovejoy escaped to Linden Wood, where Sibley provided him with a horse so he could get away into Illinois.  Retirement and death  After building Lindenwood College‚Äôs reputation as a predominant women‚Äôs school for its day, the Sibleys decided to retire from education and in 1853 deeded Lindenwood over to the Presbyterian Church. By this stage in his life, George Sibley was considered an invalid. As a result, he led a quiet life until he died on January 31, 1863. George and Mary Sibley are buried on the campus of Lindenwood University. Legacy George C. Sibley is the namesake of Sibley, Missouri.

The eight-day conference, conducted by Harvard College undergraduates, faculty, and prominent leaders from both nations, seeks to expose 600 Chinese high school students to liberal arts education. The conference includes Student Seminars led by 60 Harvard College undergraduate students, a Distinguished Speaker Series, and an entrepreneurial program organized in connection with China Thinks Big.  History  HSYLC's parent organization, HAUSCR, was founded in the fall of 2005 by seven Harvard College freshmen. HSYLC became the organization's flagship program, and the first conference was held in the summer of 2006. HSYLC 2006, supported by the Goldman Sachs Foundation and American Airlines, recruited 37 Harvard students to create and teach a curriculum at a school in Shanghai. The program received extensive media attention across China, bringing approximately 600 high school students from among thousands of applicants to participate. By 2008, the Chinese high school students at HSYLC represented 120 high schools from across China. By HSYLC 2016, the program consisted of separate sites in three cities, Beijing, Shanghai, and Hangzhou. HSYLC Hangzhou 2016 was organized in partnership with the 2016 G20 Hangzhou summit.  Student Seminars  At the heart of HSYLC's aim to foster Scholarship, the Student Seminars provide an enriching educational experience for Chinese high school students. Structured after Harvard College's own Freshman Seminar Program, seminars at HSYLC are designed and led by Harvard undergraduates who have extensive knowledge in a particular area of interest which they are passionate about teaching. Through a competitive application process, ninety to one hundred Seminar Leaders (SLs) are selected to lead week-long seminars in either Beijing, Shanghai, or Hangzhou, and are aided by a Teaching Assistant, a Chinese college student who undergoes a similarly rigorous application process. Each high school participant can explore a total of six seminar topics from a diverse array. In the past, seminars have ranged from the academic, such as The Game Theory of International Relations, Your Brain on Computers, and V.2.0: Present and Future Possibilities in Electronically Enhancing the Human Mind, to less conventional ones, including The Social Psychology of Love and Attraction and A History of Chocolate. Seminar leaders and students employ a holistic approach to exploring these topics, using historical, economic, literary, anthropological and ethnographic lenses of discipline. Beyond exposing students to new perspectives and new knowledge, these seminars introduce students to a new style of learning that incorporates active and collaborative research, critical analysis of sources and ideas, and Socratic discussions among peers.  Distinguished Speakers Series  Throughout the conference at least one speaker event is offered each day, providing students with an intensive experience and a rare opportunity to interact with some of the most distinguished figures around the world in a short period of time. Lectures place great emphasis on audience interaction. In the past years, HSYLC has been fortunate to host Mr. Jack Ma Yun, founder of Alibaba.com and CEO of Yahoo! China as well as Mr. John L.

Broadway, is a historic movie theater that opened in 1927 in the Broadway Theater District of Downtown Los Angeles. History The Tower Theatre, at South Broadway and West Eighth Street, was commissioned by H.L. Gumbiner. He would also build the Los Angeles Theatre in 1931. The Tower was the first theater designed by architect S. Charles Lee. Seating 900 on a tiny site (50 feet wide by 153 feet long), replacing the 650-seat 1911 Garrick Theatre, it was designed in powerful Baroque Revival style with innovative French, Spanish, Moorish, and Italian elements all executed in terra-cotta. Its interior was modeled after the Paris Opera House. Its exterior features a prominent clock tower, the very top of which was removed after an earthquake. The Tower was the first film house in Los Angeles to be wired for talking pictures, and it was the location of the sneak preview and Los Angeles premiere of Warner Bros.' revolutionary part-talking The Jazz Singer (1927), starring Al Jolson. It was the first theater in Los Angeles to be air conditioned. It opened in 1927 with the silent film The Gingham Girl starring Lois Wilson and George K. Arthur. For a while during the early 1950s, the name was changed to the Newsreel Theater.Photo of Tower Theater, 1951, with \\"Newsreel\\" on marquee, USC Digital Library Use as a filming location The Tower Theatre's exterior and/or interior can be seen in the following films and TV series: * The Omega Man (1971) * The Mambo Kings (1992) * Last Action Hero (1993) * Fight Club (1999) * Coyote Ugly (2000) * Mulholland Drive (2001) * The Prestige (2006) * Transformers (2007) * Twin Peaks (3rd season, 2017) * Nike, Inc. Dream Crazy (2018 ad)https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fq2CvmgoO7I&t;=81 Landmark status The Tower Theatre has been declared a Los Angeles Historic-Cultural Monument, HCM #450, by the Office of Historic Resources, Department of City Planning, City of Los Angeles. Current use As with many other historic theaters in Downtown Los Angeles, though largely intact, the theater was abandoned for many years because of migration of cinema attendance to Hollywood Boulevard and other Los Angeles locations. Over the years, its lobby has been leased to various vendors, and the auditorium has been used by the Living Faith Evangelical Church.  Refurbishment  In November 2015, the website DTLA Rising reported \\"insider info\\" that Apple Inc was interested in leasing the Tower for a retail store. Six months later, The Los Angeles Business Journal reported that Apple were \\"in the process of securing a lease\\". On August 2, 2018, The Los Angeles Times reported that Apple was submitting plans for the renovation of the building. The company also released an artist's rendering of the converted space.

It is a sinkhole lake that was created by a collapsing karst cave. It is located north-west of Tsumeb and only 100 meters from the main road B1. The lake was declared a national monument in 1972. The diameter of the lake is ; its depth is supposedly a maximum of 300 feet plus according to scans. According to a Namibian tourism information organisation, \\"the depth varies from sixty two meters at the side to one hundred meters in the center, and in some places leading off from the side depths of one hundred meters have been recorded\\", while an article in the Allgemeine Zeitung explains the depth problem: \\"the lake tapers into a lateral cave system making it impossible to determine its exact depth, estimated to be in access (sic) of 142 meters.\\" The lake was known to the San under the name Gaisis (\\"ugly\\"). When the Herero moved into the area, they named it Otjikoto (Otjiherero: \\"deep hole\\"). Namibia's Oshikoto Region, in which the lake is situated, is an alternative spelling of Otjikoto and derives its name from that of the lake. The first Europeans to discover the lake were Francis Galton and Carl Johan Andersson, who during their search for Lake Ngami came upon Otjikoto Lake in 1851. The lake was a dumping ground for German Schutztruppe during World War I; in June 1915 German troops dumped war materials in the lake before surrendering to stop the South African and British troops from using them. Most of the larger pieces have been recovered and are displayed in Tsumeb Museum, but at least two cannons, along with quantities of ammunition, are still in the lakeMonty Halls and the Kaiser's Gold, Channel 5 (UK), 25 Nov 2013 and can be viewed with a special diving permit. According to legend, the Germans also dumped a sealed safe into the lake. The search for it and the 6 million gold marks it is said to contain has as yet not been successful.http://www.montyhalls.co.uk/about-monty#am-tv-section Botanist Kurt Dinter visited the lake in 1911 and collected several hitherto unknown species of plants, among them grass of the genus Rottboellia. Tilapia guinasana, a species of cichlid fish which naturally was only found in Otjikoto's sister lake, Lake Guinas, was introduced to Otjikoto Lake.

It is a small fish, typically less than 7.62 cm (3 in) in length. Males are generally larger than females, and have bright-blue coloration, while females and juveniles are silvery or tan. A notable attribute of the desert pupfish is their ability to survive in environments of extreme salinity, pH, and temperature, and low oxygen content. The desert pupfish mates in a characteristic fashion, wherein compatible males and females will contact each other, form an s-shape, and jerk. Each jerk typically produces a single egg that is fertilized by the male and deposited in his territory. Breeding behavior includes aggressive arena-breeding and more docile consort-pair breeding. The desert pupfish is a federally listed endangered species in the United States. The desert pupfish was once a common fish, but it is now extirpated from most of its historical natural range. The decrease in population has been a trend since the early 1900s due to habitat destruction and fragmentation. It has been, and continues to be, preyed upon and displaced by non-native fishes, such as tilapia. Presently, the only remaining natural populations of the desert pupfish are located at a few sites in the Salton Sea drainage in California, and the Colorado River Delta in Baja California and Sonora, Mexico.Minckley 1973, U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service [USDI, FWS] 1993). The historic range of the desert pupfish included the lower Gila River basin in Arizona and Sonora, Mexico. It inhabited the Gila, Santa Cruz, San Pedro, and Salt Rivers as well as the lower Colorado River from around Needles, California, to the Gulf of California. Taxonomy and phylogeny Cyprinodon macularius was first described by Spencer Baird and Charles Girard in 1853. Originally, it was considered to be made up of three subspecies: the nominal desert pupfish (Cyprinodon macularius macularius), the Quitobaquito pupfish (Cyprinodon macularius eremus) and the undescribed Monkey Spring pupfish (Cyprinodon sp.).United States fish and Wildlife Service (1993). Desert Pupfish (Cyprinodon macularius) Recovery Plan. (Unpublished). Prepared for the USFWS, Region 2. The study of mitochondrial DNA variation between different populations of pupfish traditionally considered as C. macularius provide the basis for the species distinction between C. macularius and C. eremus. The mtDNA haplotypes of the pupfish endemic to the Rio Sonoyta Basin/Quitobaquito Springs and the pupfish endemic to the Salton Sea/Lower Colorado River Basin suggest sustained, mutually exclusive evolutionary histories. Furthermore, the differences between the frequency of inherited alleles of each species are significant enough to suggest that these individuals became separate species about 100,000 years ago. As a result, the three subspecies have been reclassified as three distinct species: the desert pupfish (C. macularius), the Sonoyta (Quitobaquito) pupfish (C. eremus), and the Santa Cruz (Monkey Spring) pupfish (C. arcuatus), with the Santa Cruz pupfish being described in 2002.United States Fish and Wildlife Service (2010). Desert Pupfish (Cyprinodon macularius); 5-Year Review: Summary and Evaluation. Phoenix, Arizona: USFWS. Description The desert pupfish is a small fish that is typically less than 7.62 cm (3 in) long; males are larger than females and generally have more vivid markings, especially during breeding seasons. Females and juveniles typically have tan or olive backs and silvery sides with narrow, dark vertical bars situated laterally. These bars are often interrupted to give the impression of a disjunct, lateral band. During mating season, males become bright blue on the dorsal portion of the head and sides, and yellow or orange on the caudal fin and posterior caudal peduncle.51 FR 10843 (1986-03-31). The dorsal profile of the desert pupfish is smoothly rounded, while its body is thickened and laterally compressed. The desert pupfish has a protruding mouth equipped with tricuspid teeth. Habitat and distribution U.S. distribution of C. macularius. The desert pupfish is found in shallow waters of desert springs, small streams, and marshes below 1,524 m (5,000 ft) in elevation. The species can tolerate high salinities, water temperatures, and lower oxygen content than most fish, and will occupy habitats inhospitable to invasive fish. Pupfish typically prefer clear waters with either rooted or unattached aquatic plants, restricted surface flow, or sand-silt substrates, and will do well if their habitats have little vegetation apart from mats of benthic algae.Dudek and ICF International (2012). Desert Renewable Energy Conservation Plan (DRECP) Baseline Biology Report. (Draft). Prepared for the California Energy Commission. The distribution of the desert pupfish historically ranged from the lower Colorado River in Arizona and California to the Gulf of Mexico and onto its delta in Sonora and Baja California. Specifically, the desert pupfish occurred the Salton Sink basin in California; the Gila River basin in Arizona and Sonora, including the Gila, Santa Cruz, San Pedro, and Salt Rivers; the Rio Sonoyta in Arizona and Sonora; Puerto Pe√±asco, Sonora; and the Laguna Salada basin in Baja California. A large population of desert pupfish is protected at the Cibola National Wildlife Refuge. Due to both habitat destruction and species reclassification, however, the desert pupfish has a smaller territory distribution than previously thought. As of 2010, naturally occurring populations of the desert pupfish are restricted in the United States to two tributaries and various shoreline pools and irrigation drains of the Salton Sea in California.Lau, S.; Boehm, C. (1991). A distribution survey of desert pupfish (Cyprinodon macularius) around the Salton Sea, California. Final Report for Section 6, Project No. EF9oXII-1. Prepared for the California Department of Fish and Game, Inland Fisheries Division. In Mexico, the desert pupfish is scattered along the Colorado River Delta and the Laguna Salada basin. Collectively, there are 11 known populations of extant wild desert pupfish within the United States and Mexico. Attempted reintroductions have yielded 16 transplanted populations in Arizona, as well as 46 captive or refuge populations in Arizona, California, and Mexico. Diet Pupfish are omnivores that forage in shallow water during early morning and late evening; they will move out of the shallows during the day when water temperatures may rise to 36 ¬∞C or higher to avoid heat death. The rate of surface foraging drops when water temperatures fall below 21 ¬∞C. Pupfish show some dietary preference towards nektonic organisms, going so far as to suppress or even eliminate local populations of mosquitoes. In the absence of mosquito prey, pupfish will consume benthic chironomid midges (both from substrate and from midwater when midges attempt to come to the surface), algae, small invertebrates, aquatic crustaceans, aquatic insect larvae, snails, detritus, and occasionally the eggs and young of its own species. Exposed eggs are typically and readily eaten by other pupfish of the same species if not laid in an inconspicuous area, while mobile fry are ignored unless adults are very hungry. Furthermore, though pupfish may engage in filial cannibalism, males have been observed using olfactory cues to distinguish between eggs fertilized by themselves and those fertilized by other males. This has been considered analogous to the defensive behavior of avian victims of nest parasitism, wherein they will reject alien eggs. Similarly, pupfish eggs are typically only consumed by females that do not spawn them; these two factors, coupled with the fact that males show sexual preference towards larger (and therefore more fecund) females, are consistent with parents maximizing the chances of offspring survival. Biology and ecology=Motor patterns The desert pupfish exhibits characteristic movements that can be grouped into various units as follows: *Meandering‚Äîthe female swims somewhat aimlessly in midwater or near the surface in slightly exaggerated movements. *Nuzzling‚Äîthe male swims directly under the meandering female, tilting his body upwards while keeping his head against or near the abdominal region of the female. *Contacting‚Äîas the female moves slowly, the male stays beside and slightly behind her, typically maintaining contact either side-to-side or snout-to- side. *Tilting and nipping‚Äîwhile swimming slowly, the female tilts her body downwards towards the substrate; from the tilted position, the female takes up a mouthful of substrate and drops her body to the bottom of the habitat. The female then expels the substrate and may nip two or three more times from the horizontal position. This action has been interpreted as food-seeking, and has been observed in other species as a signal for the moment of spawning. *Halting and sidling‚Äîafter nipping, the female will halt, whereupon the male will swim forward and laterally against the female, thrusting the area at the base of his anal fin against the posterior line of the female's abdomen. *S-shaping‚Äîseen from above, the pupfish forms an s-shape. Typically, both male and female will couple in parallel s-shapes on the bottom of their habitat during mating. *Wrapping‚Äîwhile both fish maintain an s-shape, the male will wrap his anal fin around the posterior area of the female's belly, forming a crude cup beneath her vent. *Jerking‚Äîwhile still in an s-shape, the pupfish will jerk its head in the opposite direction it is situated in, causing a contraction that reverses the direction of the s-shape. During jerking, the female will extrude an egg, while the male presumably releases his sperm. *Patrolling‚Äîthe territorial male will swim forwards in small, fast spurts, then stop abruptly before swimming in another direction. The male will patrol his entire territory in this way. *Facing and eyeing‚Äîtwo territorial males will approach each other head-on and face each other eye-to-eye with one to one-half body length between them. *Arching‚Äîthe pupfish will form a c-shape with the concave side facing the opponent fish. *Tail beating‚Äîa competing male will beat his caudal towards the opponent fish, causing the beating fish to swing away from its opponent. *Circling‚Äîtwo fish will circle each other at high speeds in a head-to-tail orientation; this is likely due to each fish simultaneously attempting to charge into the flank of its respective opponent, while dodging the charge of the other by turning. *Fleeing‚Äîa fleeing pupfish will swim rapidly towards cover, or, in its absence, towards the water's surface. *Escaping‚Äîa pupfish will dive into the substrate of its habitat and remain motionless. Reproduction The breeding season of the desert pupfish typically occurs during early spring and into winter when water temperatures exceed about 20 ¬∞C. Under conditions of abundant food and suitable temperature, the desert pupfish may become sexually mature as early as six weeks of age. Though they may start to breed during their first summer, most pupfish do not reproduce until their second. Breeding behavior includes both territorial arena-breeding (high aggression) and consort-pair breeding (low aggression). The former occurs in large habitats with high primary productivity, limited breeding substrates, and high population density, and it is the most common; the latter occurs in habitats with low primary productivity, abundant breeding substrates, and low population density. During the breeding season, male pupfish establish and actively patrol and defend individual territories that are typically less than 1 meter deep and 1‚Äì2 meters in area; these territories vary in size based on individual fish size, density of other male pupfish, and water temperature, and are associated with small structures or incongruities of substrate. Adult females will swim in loose schools and forage inconspicuously. When a female is ready to spawn, she will leave the school to enter the territory of an attractive male, and the mating process described above will commence. Breeding The reproductive behavior of the desert pupfish occurs in a characteristic fashion. Typically, males remain in their territory, while females, either alone or in groups, visit them: this is characteristic of arena-breeding. If a single female enters his territory, spawning occurs immediately; however, if multiple females are present, the male will swim from one female to the next until the proper response is given, whereupon spawning will occur. Females out of oestrus will continuously forage. Occasionally, a male from a neighboring territory will rush to the side of the female opposite the resident male and spawn with the pair. When a female is ready to spawn, she will typically nip and tilt every 3 to 5 seconds. At this point, the male will immediately contact and attempt to sidle the female. After the third to fifth nip, the female will halt, allowing the male to fully sidle. Sidling by the male causes the female to form an S-shape, which causes the male to also form an S-shape and concurrently wrap his anal fin around the female's vent. After the female is wrapped, both fish jerk; jerking typically causes the female to release one egg, while ostensibly causing the male to fertilize said egg. Though the pair usually separates to leave one fertilized egg in the substrate, the female will very occasionally immediately form an S-shape and both fish will again perform the jerking sequence. Spawning lasts from 30 minutes to 2 hours, with larger females spawning more than smaller females. Typically, the last coupling of the pupfish is the most prolonged, and several eggs are laid in succession. After copulation, both fish lie in the substrate, and after about 2 seconds, the male will contact the female again. If the female is finished spawning, she will flee in a \\"panicky\\" style with the male in pursuit. This chase lasts for about 5 minutes before the male swims to the bottom and both fish begin foraging. Extreme conditions C. macularius are euryhaline and eurythermal, tolerating temperatures between approximately 4¬∫ and 45 ¬∞C and salinities ranging from 0 to 70 parts per thousand, exceeding the tolerances of virtually all other freshwater fish. The desert pupfish can also survive dissolved-oxygen concentrations as low as 0.13 ppm. The desert pupfish has been noted to be more abundant in environments with high vegetative cover, pH and salinity, and low dissolved oxygen and sediment factors, thus suggesting that living in extreme conditions allows them to survive in environments that are hostile to invasive or nonnative fish. Management factors Listed as endangered in 1986, the desert pupfish has been the focus of many conservation studies and attempts. The threats to desert pupfish survival include the destruction of habitat, including loss and/or degradation of habitat through groundwater pumping and water diversion; contamination from agricultural return flows and other contaminants; and physical changes in water quality. Disease and predation due to invasive and nonnative species, as well as environmental competition and behavioral interference of these species are cited as possible threats, though the direct effects of these factors are unknown. Various management factors have been suggested as beneficial towards saving the desert pupfish, including the control and management of exotic and invasive species in pupfish habitats; the maintenance of water levels, quality, and the proper functioning condition of ponds, springs, and drains; the restoration and enhancement of degraded habitat; and the establishment of large primary refuge populations for each group of wild C. macularius. The reintroduction of the desert pupfish to wild habitats has been moderately successful, with the establishment of captive or refuge desert pupfish populations has been more fruitful. Water management has been largely cited as having the greatest impact on the survival of C. macularius.

The Esri UC comprehensively covers GIS from the perspective of Esri's software and approach; the technical workshops focus on Esri products, and occasionally on software by other vendors as it relates to Esri's products. GIS software by other vendors ‚Äì Autodesk, MapInfo, Google, and others ‚Äì is not the focus of the conference, although translation and interoperability issues may be addressed during technical workshops. alt=Jack Dangermond, President of Esri A number of awards are presented during the Plenary Session and throughout the conference week to honor organizations and individuals doing innovative and meaningful things with GIS. Recent plenary award presentations have included the Enterprise Application Award, Making a Difference Award, GIS Humanitarian Award, The President's Award, and Lifetime Achievement Award. Other conference aspects that highlight awards include the Special Achievement in GIS (SAG) Awards ceremony, Map Gallery and Virtual Map Gallery, User Software Applications Fair, sports activities, and other various contests such as scavenger hunts, satellite image picture puzzles (the Where in the World contest), and the closing session question poll. The conference's Student Assistantship Program was started in the early 1990s. Each year, up to 60 accepted students from around the world spend the week monitoring sessions and assisting with other event logistics. The assistantship is unpaid but provides conference registration, hotel accommodations, a stipend for meals, and free time to attend sessions and network. For two hours Wednesday night of conference week, the Exhibit Pavilion is opened to family and friends of attendees for Family Night. This is the only time that guests of attendees can visit the Exhibit Pavilion, where technology vendors and demonstrations are available‚Äîand attendees can show their guests what GIS involves. The GIS Kids Camp provides children of all ages with a way to explore GIS. Children learn how GIS helps them ask questions and visualize the answers. The camp was launched at the 1997 Esri UC in San Diego. Over the years, the program has introduced GIS to more than 1,500 children. A conference highlight is the Thursday Night Party, which has a different theme each year that ranges from Mardi Gras to a Renaissance Faire, to Oktoberfest. The Spatial Outlet and Bookstore offers T-shirts, mouse pads, and other event memorabilia. There are also GIS books for sale as well as author signings. This is the spot to acquire souvenirs and books from Esri Press, as well as other specialty merchandise. Over the last several years Esri, its business partners, and the San Diego venues have increased the ecofriendliness of the event. Examples of this include using reusable materials and recycled paper for promotional items such as tote bags and agendas; making previously printed items only available on the Web; selling organic T-shirts in the Spatial Outlet store; offering recycling bins, water in bottles which use less plastic, biodegradable food service items, and food purchased from local growers when possible; as well as encouraging and promoting resources for carpooling and renting a bike as transportation for the week. Esri turned 40 in 2009. Jack Dangermond (current president) and Laura Dangermond (current vice president) founded Esri in 1969 as a landscape architectural consulting firm. Esri products are used by nearly 80 percent of all GIS users. The company remains a private corporation with consistent annual growth and annual revenue of more than $610 million. There are more than 4,000 employees. The Esri headquarters are located in Redlands, California. There are 10 regional offices in the U.S. and a network of 80 international distributors with about a million users in 200 countries.

Chicago: Chicago Society of Artists, 1979 Mintz was born in Ostrowiec, Poland in 1907. He graduated from the Academy of Fine Arts in Warsaw in 1927 with a Master of Fine Arts degree and after a fellowship in Brazil, he immigrated to the United States, where he spent the majority of his professional years painting in the Chicago and Los Angeles areas. He was a visiting professor at Washington University in St. Louis in 1954‚Äì55 and professor of painting at the School of the Art Institute of Chicago (SAIC) from 1956‚Äì69 before he retiring from teaching to dedicate his time exclusively to painting. Mintz also taught at many Chicago area arts institutions, including the Evanston Art Center and the North Shore Art League. Mintz was a registered Illinois artist for the Works Progress Administration Federal Art Project during the 1930s. His artwork, realistic in the beginning, grew more and more abstract as his career progressed, reflecting the uncertainties of life between the two world wars. His Self-Portrait, painted in 1931, shows the artist in his early twenties, wearing a shirt and tie under his artist smock, and posed against a background of books as if to emphasize the artist as both a worker and an educated, thinking man. Mintz was active in Chicago‚Äôs Jewish community. Having lost his father, mother, sisters, and other relatives in the Holocaust, he sought out surviving members of his extended family during the postwar years, advertising in European newspapers and perusing thousands of telephone book pages. In 1987, he gathered the surviving members of the Mintz family for a reunion in Chicago. He died in Chicago in 2002. Mintz taught at the Art Institute of Chicago and Washington University in St. Louis.

It was not until 5 October 2009 that her partial remains were discovered, after a plastic bin bag containing human bones was located by a workman on the M5 motorway near Thornbury, South Gloucestershire. The bones, which included a pelvis, thigh bone and skull, were analysed and identified as belonging to Melanie Hall on 7 October 2009. It was determined that Hall had suffered severe fractures to her skull and face, and had been tied up with rope, although a definitive cause of death could not be established. Over the years, various people have been arrested but subsequently released. Background Hall was described by her parents as a \\"young, vibrant daughter\\". She had graduated from the University of Bath in 1995; Hall's mother, Pat Hall, said graduation had been a \\"cherished\\" dream of Melanie's for four years. Melanie Hall worked as a clerical officer at Bath's Royal United Hospital. Her father, Stephen Hall, has served Bath City Football Club as a chairman. Disappearance Hall had arranged to stay with her boyfriend Philip Karlbaum on 8 June and her mother dropped her off at his home. On the night of 8 June 1996 Hall went to Cadillacs nightclub in Bath with Karlbaum and another couple. Hall was reported as having had an argument with Karlbaum, and he left the club \\"upset\\" after he allegedly saw her dancing with another man. Hall was last seen sitting on a stool in the club at around 1.10am on 9 June 1996. She was reported missing on 11 June 1996 by her parents after she failed to turn up for work. Karlbaum described his devastation at her disappearance on 17 June 1996. Avon and Somerset police launched several searches of the River Avon after her disappearance and interviewed thousands of clubbers and taxi drivers. A ¬£10,000 reward was offered for information, the BBC show Crimewatch and Crimestoppers both made appeals to the public for information, as did Hall's sister Dominique, but no trace of Hall was found. Hall was declared legally dead on 17 November 2004. Discovery of remains On 5 October 2009, a motorway worker found a plastic bin bag containing bones while he was clearing a vegetation patch on a slip road at Junction 14 of the M5 motorway. The bones in the bag included a skull, pelvis and thigh bone and further remains were found buried and spread around the field by the side of the motorway. Police confirmed that the remains were human, and they showed a piece of jewellery found at the site to Mr and Mrs Hall, who confirmed that it had belonged to their daughter. Despite this, police refused to confirm that the body was that of Miss Hall until a post-mortem had been carried out. The remains were formally identified as being Hall's through dental records on 7 October. She had incurred severe blunt trauma to her head resulting in a fractured skull, cheekbone and jaw. Hall had also been tied up with a blue rope. Hall's parents launched a fresh appeal on 8 October for anyone with information to come forward, while Avon and Somerset CID DS Mike Britton stated that he was staying on after his retirement to continue working on the Hall disappearance, codenamed Operation Denmark, having spent 13 years on the case. On 29 October 2009, police announced that three keys to a Ford vehicle, possibly a Transit, Fiesta or Escort had been found near the body, and that they were working with Ford to try to identify the vehicle. Crimewatch also launched a fresh appeal for information, which resulted in more than 200 phone calls from the public. The reward for information leading to arrest was also increased to ¬£20,000. In October 2019, police revealed they had obtained a partial DNA profile from the rope wrapped around the bag containing Hall's remains and stated that they remained confident that Hall's killer would be caught. Her parents reinstated a ¬£50,000 reward for information leading to an arrest and conviction. Arrests In 2003, police arrested two men in connection with Hall's disappearance but they were released without charge after police searched buildings and a field near Bath. In 2009, a 37-year-old man confessed his involvement in Hall's murder to police in Greater Manchester, but was eliminated from the inquiry after undergoing psychiatric tests. In July 2010, a 38-year-old man from Bath was arrested on suspicion of Hall's murder and subsequently released on bail. In August 2010, a 39-year-old man from Wiltshire was arrested by police on suspicion of murder after handing himself in at a police station in the Avon and Somerset area. The man was subsequently released on bail. In October 2013, police said that they had found a white Volkswagen Golf car connected to their inquiries, and had received relevant information about the rope used to tie up Hall's body. On 25 November 2013, it was reported that a 44-year-old man had been arrested at an address in Bath, on suspicion of murder. The man was released on bail until 19 December, and a property at Roundhill Park, Whiteway, was searched. On 28 November 2014 it was reported that there was insufficient evidence to charge the suspect. On 23 June 2016, a 45-year-old man was arrested following retrieval of DNA from where Hall's remains were discovered, and released on bail a few days later. By October 2019, eleven arrests had been made during the police investigation but no one has ever been charged. Links to other cases Police have not ruled out links with the murder of estate agent Suzy Lamplugh (who disappeared in July 1986 and whose body has never been found) and the case of a serial sex attacker in Bath, nicknamed the \\"Batman rapist\\" after he left a baseball cap bearing a Batman logo at the scene of one attack. The unknown assailant is known to have attempted to carjack a woman at knifepoint, leaving her wounded when she fought back and managed to escape, in the same area of the city a few hours before Hall was abducted. It has also been suggested that there may be a link between Hall's murder and Levi Bellfield, who is serving life imprisonment with a whole life order for three murders committed between 2002 and 2004. A suggested link with convicted killer Christoper Halliwell, who is serving a life sentence with a whole life order for the murders of Sian O'Callaghan and Becky Godden-Edwards, has been ruled out by Avon and Somerset Police.

Evacuees on Interstate 4 leaving Florida's Gulf Coast during Hurricane Irma in 2017. Hurricane evacuation is the immediate and rapid movement of people away from the threat or actual occurrence of a hurricane. Local authorities (such as county judges and emergency managers) in a predicted hurricane path often recommend (voluntary evacuation) or order evacuation (mandatory evacuation) of designated flood zones due primarily to risk of storm surge. Evacuation=Determining whether evacuation is necessary Due to the danger of hurricanes, evacuating should always be an option during strong hurricanes. Some residents may believe that due to the monetary cost of evacuation and the price of not being there to care for their home, evacuation is not a good choice. Due to the potential health and safety risks, authorities in some areas should give evacuation their meaningful consideration. Hurricane evacuation can be vital to individual safety in some circumstances, including the following:\\"How Hurricanes Impact You\\" * past hurricanes have caused storm- surge damage * the home is built on a floodplain * living in a mobile home * the home lacks hurricane structural reinforcement \\"Against the Wind\\" * local officials recommend it Officials advise that people who are not evacuating should carefully monitor severe weather updates provided by emergency broadcasting services, since the direction and potential danger of a hurricane may change suddenly. Means Private cars may not be an efficient means of evacuating. The traffic jams that thousands of motorists experienced in South Carolina while fleeing Hurricane Floyd and Texas while fleeing Hurricane Rita exemplify the frustration of people trying to evacuate. Some jurisdictions have implemented contraflow lane reversal plans in an attempt to increase outbound traffic capacity from coastal areas, but traffic jams still occur in these situations. Many buses and coaches in New Orleans can change their destination boards to \\"EVACUATION\\" in times of a hurricane, effectively doubling as ambulances. Social capital refers to the connections between people: social networks and the reciprocity and trust within them. The social systems of communities can have a large impact on their ability and willingness to evacuate. Weak social networks within a community can make evacuation difficult. If people don't trust each other, then they are likely to fear that their homes or stores will be looted if they evacuate. Communities that have the physical capital, such as cars, to evacuate everyone may not have the social capital to facilitate sharing these resources. However, strong social networks within a community can also hinder evacuation by increasing the ties to the neighborhood and refusing to evacuate. Shadow evacuation There were an estimated 6.8 million Floridians who evacuated during Hurricane Irma, with some doing so twice. Subtle shifts in the storm's path first sent evacuees from the east to west coast of the state, and then north when Leon County ran out of hotel rooms and filled ten shelters with people, some of whom were from other parts of the state. Officials said 3 million of those evacuees were not actually in an evacuation zone. These \\"shadow evacuees\\" caused gridlock on Florida's Turnpike, which meant a 20-hour trek into Georgia as lines of cars escaped Florida, and state officials advised those not in an evacuation zone to stay home if they can next time because with the exception of mobile homes, evacuations in Florida are based on storm surge, not wind. This means people should evacuate tens of miles inland, not hundreds of miles north.\\"Some state officials want ‚Äúshadow evacuees‚Äù to stay home next hurricane\\" Palm Beach Daily News\\"Irma forced mass evacuations; officials urge staying home next time\\" Palm Beach Post Hurricane evacuation route A hurricane evacuation route sign on Tulane Avenue in New Orleans, Louisiana, after Hurricane Katrina. The signage below suggests tuning to WWL Radio or sister station WLMG for emergency information. Hurricane evacuation route marking near the Texas Gulf Coast A hurricane evacuation route (also called coastal evacuation route or evacuation route) is a highway in the United States that is a specified route for hurricane evacuation. Along the Gulf Coast, hurricane evacuation routes lead north and west for up to hundreds of miles to the safest major city. Along the Atlantic Coast, routes lead west. They are marked with blue signs that point in the correct direction. During mass evacuations, these roads (and especially interstate highways) have been set up with paved crossover lanes so that both north and southbound lanes flow north and west and eastbound lanes flow west, a procedure known as contraflow. In some cases, traffic may still be backed up, bumper-to-bumper. Every U.S. state bordering a marginal sea of the Atlantic Ocean primarily uses signed evacuation routes, with the exception of Connecticut, New Hampshire, and Rhode Island. Resistance to evacuating The longer people have lived in a coastal area, the less likely they are to evacuate. Hurricanes have a longer warning time than most disasters, but details of strength and track are only educated guesses. Official warnings, as with other scenario planning, are based on a worst case, which is not the most probable case. Thus, hurricanes can be predicted to hit a coastal town many times without the town ever actually experiencing the brunt of a storm. When this more probable case happens a number of times, people tend to take evacuation orders less seriously. If evacuation orders are given too early, the hurricane can change course and leave the evacuated area unscathed. People may think they have weathered hurricanes before, when in reality the hurricane didn't hit them directly, giving them false confidence. Those who have lived on the coast for ten or more years are the most resistant to evacuating. Despite mandatory evacuation orders, many people did not leave New Orleans, as Hurricane Katrina approached. Even after the city was flooded and uninhabitable, some people still refused to leave their homes.\\"New Orleans rescues continue, but some won't go\\" NPR 9-6-05\\"Rescuers urge residents to leave New Orleans\\" NPR 9-6-05 See also *Civil defense *Contraflow lane reversal *Emergency evacuation *Emergency management *Evacuation process simulation *List of mass evacuations *Emergency airplane evacuation *Shelter in place *Vertical and horizontal evacuation References * Abrahams, John: \\"Fire escape in difficult circumstances\\", chapter 6, In: Stollard, 1994, Design against fire. * Gershenfeld, Neil, Mathematical Modelling.

Early life Her first teacher and the most important was Mme Livia Va»õianu- VrƒÉbiescu. Krilovici completed her studies at the Ciprian Porumbescu music academy in Bucharest. She received a scholarship to go to Italy and study with coaches like Maria Caniglia and Luigi Ricci. Her talent, musicality and voice distinguished her in such international competitions as George Enescu 1964, Hertogenbosch 1966, Brussels 1966, and Montreal 1967, where she earned first prize and a gold medal. Debuting in 1966 at the National Opera of Bucharest as Donna Anna in Don Giovanni, she continued performing at the Opera of Bucharest, with achievements in lyric and dramatic roles. From 1968 to 1976 she was a member of the Hamburg State Opera. In 1971, she defected from Romania and settled in Germany. Germany In 1973, Krilovici became a German citizen. The artist, who was married until 1993 to the late baritone Kostas Paskalis (1929‚Äì2007), with whom she has two children, Constantin, b. 1974, and Alexandra, b. 1977, has performed in major world theatres, including Hamburg, Vienna, Chicago, Metropolitan Opera New York, Covent Garden, Rome, Berlin, Paris, Lisbon, La Fenice, Munich and Montreal. In 1968 and 1969, she was heard at the Toronto Opera House as Floria Tosca. In the years 1970‚Äì1978 she appeared at the Vienna State Opera in roles like Santuzza in Mascagni's Cavalleria rusticana, Tosca, and √âlisabeth de Valois in Verdi's Don Carlos. In 1972, she performed at the Deutsche Oper Berlin as Santuzza. Other guest appearances at La Fenice in Venice (1971, as Tosca), the Covent Garden Opera London (1971, Aida, opposite the celebrated Romanian mezzo-soprano Viorica Cortez), the Teatro Nacional de S√£o Carlos (1975 as Manon Lescaut and 1978 as Tosca), the Op√©ra national du Rhin, Strasbourg (1976, Tatiana in Eugene Onegin), the Op√©ra de Monte-Carlo (1979, √âlisabeth), La Monnaie (1979, Amelia in Donizetti's Il Duca d'Alba), and the Scottish Opera in Glasgow (1980, Tosca). In 1985‚Äì1986, she was a guest performer at the Op√©ra Royal de Wallonie Liege as Tosca. She was also a guest in Amsterdam, Copenhagen, Mexico City and 1982‚Äì1985 several times in Athens, where she sang Leonora in La forza del destino by Verdi. United States Krilovici had a successful United States career as well, making her debut there in 1972 at the San Francisco Opera as A√Øda. From 1972‚Äì1974, she sang at the Lyric Opera of Chicago as Mimi, the tragic heroine of Puccini's La boh√®me, and as Cio-Cio-San. She sang at the Opera House of New Orleans in 1975 as Tosca and appeared at Miami Opera in 1979 as √âlisabeth in Don Carlos. In the seasons 1973‚Äì1974 and 1975‚Äì1977 she was engaged at the New York Metropolitan Opera where she sang Cio-Cio-San, Giorgetta in Puccini's Il tabarro, and Leonora in Verdi's Il trovatore. She sang with renowned singers (Pl√°cido Domingo, Luciano Pavarotti, Tito Gobbi, Jos√© Carreras, Renato Bruson, Nikolai Giaurov, Nicola Ghiuselev, Giangiacomo Guelfi, Fiorenza Cossotto, Shirley Verrett, and Nicola Martinucci) and conductors (Claudio Abbado, Georg Solti, Nello Santi, Stein, Lorin Maazel, Riccardo Muti, and many others). Krilovici was not only known for her magnificent voice quality, but her stage presence and personality and her ability to give dimension to the characters she interpreted made her performances of Tosca, Butterfly, Aida, and Santuzza memorable. Greece In the early '90s, her Greek nationality on her mother's side, in addition to her marriage to Greek-born Paskalis, brought her to Athens, where she started her collaboration with the Athens National Opera. Greek audiences welcomed her as she sang at the Herodion and the Athens Concert Hall. Her new career as a teacher at the Maria Callas Athenaeum Conservatory has given her the opportunity to pass on her international experience to young singers, and her devotion and love towards them has made her successful. Many of her students are already following her steps in theaters all over the world. She also participates as a jury member in international competitions and gives master classes.

He is the author of a number of books on the subject, including Religion and the Racist Right: The Origins of the Christian Identity Movement (1996), A Culture of Conspiracy: Apocalyptic Visions in Contemporary America (2003), and Chasing Phantoms: Reality, Imagination, and Homeland Security Since 9/11 (2011). Barkun has acted as a consultant for the Federal Bureau of Investigation; as a member of the Special Advisory Commission to the FBI Critical Incident Response Group from late 1995 to early 1996, he provided training and background presentations on extremist groups. He serves on the editorial boards of Terrorism and Political Violence and Nova Religio, and was the editor of Communal Societies from 1987 to 1994. He edits the Religion and Politics book series for the Syracuse University Press. He won the 2003 Distinguished Scholar award from the Communal Studies Association, and the Myers Center Award for the Study of Human Rights for his book Religion and the Racist Right. Barkun focuses particularly on millenarian and utopian movements, terrorism and \\"doomsday weapons,\\" and the contemporary influence of the Protocols of the Elders of Zion (decades after it was exposed as a hoax). His books have been reviewed by The New York Times, The New York Sun, The Montana Professor, and Terrorism and Political Violence. In a 2004 review, historian Paul S. Boyer wrote that Barkun \\"knows his way around the arcane world of contemporary conspiracy theorists\\" more \\"than any other scholar in America.\\"  Conspiracy theory research  Barkun has classified conspiracy theories into three kinds: * Event conspiracy theories. This refers to limited and well-defined events. Examples may include such conspiracies theories as those concerning the Kennedy assassination, 9/11, and the spread of AIDS. * Systemic conspiracy theories. The conspiracy is believed to have broad goals, usually conceived as securing control of a country, a region, or even the entire world. The goals are sweeping, whilst the conspiratorial machinery is generally simple: a single, evil organization implements a plan to infiltrate and subvert existing institutions. This is a common scenario in conspiracy theories that focus on the alleged machinations of Jews, Freemasons, Communism, or the Catholic Church. * Superconspiracy theories. For Barkun, such theories link multiple alleged conspiracies together hierarchically. At the summit is a distant but all-powerful evil force. His cited examples are the ideas of David Icke and Milton William Cooper. *Barkun discusses four types of groups categorized by the nature of secrecy involved: a Type 1 conspiracy theory refers to a secret group which acts secretly, and a Type 3 conspiracy theory refers to a known group which acts secretly (Types 2 and 4 lie outside of conspiracy theory).

Manor The Domesday Book records that in 1086 Alkerton had two main manors. Miles Crispin held the larger manor as part of the Honour of Wallingford. Odo, Bishop of Bayeux, William the Conqueror's half-brother, held the smaller manor. Parish church The oldest parts of the Church of England parish church of St Michael and All Angels are the lower stages of the central bell tower, which date from the 12th century in the Transitional style between Norman and Early English Gothic. Towards the end of the 12th century the south aisle was added, linked with the nave by an Early English Gothic arcade of two bays. Early in the 13th century the east and west arches of the central tower were replaced with Early English Gothic ones. A stone effigy of a knight in an early 13th-century style was presumably added about the same time. Early in the 14th century the upper stages of the bell tower were built and the nave was rebuilt. Late in the 14th century a clerestory was added to the nave. The exterior of the clerestory is elaborately decorated with figures of men and animals carved from Hornton stone. The style of carving belongs to a school of 14th century north Oxfordshire masons whose work survives also at Adderbury, Bloxham and Hanwell. Early in the 17th century the rector, the mathematician Thomas Lydiat, had the chancel rebuilt in the Perpendicular Gothic style. In 1889 the architect JA Cossins restored the church building and added an organ chamber south of the tower and east of the south aisle. St Michael's is now a Grade I listed building. The tower has a chime of four bells but they are not currently ringable. The oldest bell was cast in about 1400 and another was cast in 1618. St Michael's is now one of eight ecclesiastical parishes in the Ironstone Benefice. Social and economic history The road into Alkerton from the southeast Thomas Lydiat was descended from Christopher Lydiat of London, who bought Alkerton manor house in 1567. Thomas Lydiat became rector of Alkerton in 1612 and had the rectory built in 1625. By 1624 Alkerton had a watermill, presumably on Sor Brook. It was absent from village records by 1778. An open field system prevailed in the parish until 1777, when an Act of Parliament was passed for its common lands to be enclosed. The main road between Banbury and Stratford-upon-Avon passes through the northeast part of the former parish of Alkerton. It was made into a turnpike in 1743‚Äì44. Since the 1920s it has been classified as part of the A422 road. In 1782 Alkerton had a public house, the White Lion. An elementary school was established in Alkerton as a National School, but it failed to attract as many children as it was intended to serve. In 1905 it was closed and its children were transferred to the larger National School in neighbouring Shenington. By 1959 the Oxfordshire Ironstone Company was a major owner of land around Alkerton. Amenities Alkerton's nearest public house, the New Inn, is on the Stratford Road about northeast of the village, in Wroxton Heath.

Only twelve individuals were brought to trial (with mixed results), and the proceedings were widely regarded at the time as a failure. In the longer term, however, the trials have been seen as a significant step towards the introduction of a comprehensive system for the prosecution of violations of international law. Background During the First World War the Allied leaders came up with a new concept, that once victory was achieved, defeated enemy leaders should face criminal charges for international law violations made during the war. On 25 January 1919, during the Paris Peace Conference, the Allied governments established the Commission of Responsibilities to make recommendations to that effect. As a result, articles 227‚Äì230 of the Treaty of Versailles stipulated the arrest and trial of German officials defined as war criminals by the Allied governments. Article 227 made provision for the establishment of a special tribunal, presided over by a judge from each of the major Allied powers ‚Äì Britain, France, Italy, United States and Japan. It identified the former Kaiser Wilhelm II as a war criminal, and demanded that an extradition request be addressed to the Dutch government, which had given him asylum in the Netherlands since his abdication in November 1918. Article 228 allowed the Allied governments to try alleged German war criminals in military tribunals. In violation of the legal principle of double jeopardy, Allied prosecutions could proceed even in cases where the accused had already been tried, convicted and sentenced in court-martial proceedings under German military law. The German government was required to comply with any extradition order issued by the Allied powers to that effect. Following the conclusion of the treaty, the Allied governments began their legal and diplomatic efforts to arrest the former Kaiser. On 28 June 1919, the day the treaty was signed, the President of the Paris Peace Conference addressed a diplomatic note to the Dutch government demanding the extradition of the ex-Kaiser. However, the former Kaiser was a very near relative of the Dutch Royal Family and on 7 July the Dutch Foreign Office replied that extradition of the Kaiser would be a violation of the Netherlands' policy of neutrality.Foreign Relations of the United States, 1919: Paris Peace Conference, vol. 13, pp. 374‚Äì375 Eventually the issue of bringing the ex-Kaiser to trial was dropped, and he remained at his Dutch estate of Huis Doorn until his death on 4 June 1941. In anticipation of further Allied action, the German National Assembly established a Central Bureau for the Defence of Germans Accused of War Crimes. On 4 October 1919, at a meeting in Berlin, Johannes Goldsche of the Prussian Bureau of Investigation reported that his office had compiled some 5,000 detailed dossiers on Allied war crimes, which could be made immediately available to defence counsel in the event of prosecutions being brought against German soldiers. The bureau had also investigated Allied allegations of German war crimes, but in this case was not planning to make its findings public for fear of possible repercussions from the Allies.De Zayas (1989), p. 9. The Reichsgericht building in Leipzig On 3 February 1920, the Allies submitted a further list of 900 names of alleged war criminals to the German government. However, the Germans refused to extradite any German citizens to Allied governments, and suggested instead trying them within the German justice system, i.e. at the Reichsgericht in Leipzig. This proposal was accepted by the Allied leaders, and in May 1920 they handed the Germans a reduced list of 45 accused persons. Not all these people could be traced, and in other cases there was difficulty in finding credible evidence.The Leipzig Trials, 1921, p. 9.Yarnall 2011, pp. 184‚Äì85. In the end only twelve individuals were brought to trial. The trials The trials were held before the Reichsgericht (comprising seven judges) in Leipzig from 23 May to 16 July 1921. The Heynen trial Sergeant Karl Heynen, who was charged with using corporal punishment, including his fists and rifle butt, against 200 British and 40 Russian POWs, who were under his command as forced laborers at the Friedrich der Grosse coal mine at Herne, in Westphalia. Heynen further stood accused, of having driven a British POW named Cross insane through various cruelties, including throwing the POW into a shower bath with alternating hot and cold water, for half an hour. It was further alleged that, after a British POW named MacDonald had escaped and been recaptured, that Heynen had hit MacDonald with his rifle butt, knocked him down and kicked him. Also, on October 14, 1915, Heynen stood accused of having threatened the POWs under his command with summary execution if they did not immediately return to work during at attempted strike. Heynen had already been court-martialed and convicted for these same offenses and had been sentenced to fourteen days \\"detention in a fortress\\", which was suspended until the end of the war. At the insistence of the British Government, however, double jeopardy was set aside and Heynen was retried for the same offenses. Heynen was acquitted for his actions during the strike, as the court ruled that POWs were entitled to complain but not to refuse to follow orders. Heynen was, however, convicted of fifteen other incidents of unnecessary brutality.Yarnall (2011), pp. 185‚Äì188. In passing sentence, the court declared, \\"One cannot help acknowledging that this is a case of extremely rough acts of brutality aggravated by the fact that these acts were perpetrated against defenceless prisoners against whom one should have acted in the most proper manner, if the good reputation of the German Army and the respect of the German Nation as a nation of culture was to be upheld... There can be no question of detention in a fortress in view of the nature of his offenses, especially those committed against prisoners who were undoubtedly sick. On the contrary, a sentence of imprisonment must be passed.\\" Even though imprisonment in a regular jail was considered degrading to military honour, Heynen was sentenced to ten months in a civilian prison. The M√ºller trial Captain Emil M√ºller, the former Commandant of the POW camp at Flavy- le-Martel, which had, long before his arrival, turned into, \\"a large cesspool\\", where 1,000 British POWs were squeezed into an area of only 60 square feet. Captain M√ºller was able to prove that he had tried very hard to improve conditions at the camp and was hamstrung from doing more by military bureaucracy. His lawyer was also able to show that a dysentery outbreak that killed 500 POWs had taken place after M√ºller's term as Commandant had ended. However, the court considered nine instances of deliberate personal cruelty to be proved, as well as an additional case in which M√ºller allowed a subordinate to mistreat a POW, other cases of breaches of regulations, as well as two cases of verbal abuse. The court sentenced M√ºller to six months in a civilian prison, with the time of detention during the trial counting as part of his sentence.Yarnall (2011), pp. 188‚Äì190. The term \\"command responsibility\\" was first used in the trial of Captain M√ºller.ICLR report on the Leipzig War Trials , lawreports.co.uk; accessed December 28, 2015. The Neumann trial Private Robert Neumann, who had guarded Allied POWs who were forced labourers at a chemical factory at Pommerensdorf, also stood accused on unnecessary brutality. In some cases, Neumann was able to demonstrate that he only followed orders from Sergeant Heinrich Trinke, who could not be found for trial. In other cases, however, Private Neumann was found to have physically abused POWs under his own initiative. The court considered twelve out of the seventeen charges against Neumann to be proved. In passing sentence,the court declared, \\"The accused kicked, struck, or otherwise physically ill-treated prisoners who were under his charge and were his subordinates. He did this deliberately and intended that his blows should hurt the prisoners. In doing this he had absolutely no justification.\\" Private Neumann was sentenced to six months in a civilian prison, with the four months he had already spent awaiting trial counting as part of his sentence.Yarnall (2011), pp. 190‚Äì191. The Dover Castle trial Kapit√§nleutnant Karl Neumann of U-boat , who had torpedoed and sunk the British hospital ship Dover Castle in the Mediterranean Sea on 26 May 1917, stood accused of war crimes on the high seas. Neumann was able to prove, however, that he had only followed orders from his superiors in the Imperial German Navy. The Imperial German Government had accused the Allies of using hospital ships for military purposes and had announced on 19 March 1917 that U-boats could sink hospital ships under certain conditions. The court held that Neumann believed the sinking to be a lawful act and found him not guilty of war crimes. The Llandovery Castle trial HMHS Llandovery Castle Oberleutnants Ludwig Dithmar and John Boldt also stood accused of war crimes on the high seas. They were two junior officers of the submarine SM U-86, which had not only torpedoed and sunk the Canadian hospital ship Llandovery Castle, but had also machine-gunned the survivors in the lifeboats. The sinking had taken place off the coast of Ireland on 27 June 1918 and was the deadliest Canadian maritime disaster of the First World War. 234 doctors, nurses, members of the Canadian Army Medical Corps, soldiers and seamen died in the sinking and in the subsequent machine-gunning of and ramming of the lifeboats by U-86's crew. Only 24 people, the occupants of a single life-raft, survived. Dithmar and Boldt were found guilty of war crimes and were both sentenced to four years in prison. The German Government had accused the Royal Navy of war crimes for similarly shooting the unarmed survivors of U-27 and for ramming a lifeboat containing the survivors of U-41 during the Baralong incidents and had been outraged by the British Government's refusal to prosecute the perpetrators. Even so, the sentences of Dithmar and Boldt were later overturned on appeal. The grounds were that they only followed orders and that their commanding officer alone was responsible. Their commanding officer, Helmut Br√ºmmer-Patzig, had fled to the Free City of Danzig and was never prosecuted. Max Ramdohr Max Ramdohr was charged with crimes against civilian noncombatants during the Rape of Belgium. He was found not guilty. The POW massacres trial Lieutenant-General Karl Stenger, the former commander of the 58th Infantry Brigade, stood accused of having ordered Major Benno Crusius in August 1914 to subject all French POWs to summary execution. Major Crusius stood accused of two separate massacres of French POWs, at Saarburg on 21 August 1914 and in a forest near Sainte Barbe on 26 August 1914. General Stenger, was able to prove that he had issued no such orders and, even though he could, like Peter von Hagenbach, have been convicted under the principle of command responsibility, the General was found not guilty of war crimes. In regard to both POW massacres, Major Crusius did not deny having passed on and carried out \\"the order\\". However, the court ruled that medical experts had convincingly demonstrated that, \\"at the moment when the alleged brigade order was passed on\\", Major Crusius \\"was suffering from a morbid derangement of his mental faculties which rendered impossible the exercise of his own volition. These experts do not hold that this was already the case on 21 August. The Court shares this view... As in accordance with practice, reasonable doubt as to the volition of the guilty party does not allow of a pronouncement of guilt, no sentence can be passed against Crusius as regards the 26th of August.\\"Yarnall (2011), p. 193. Despite being found not guilty by reason of insanity for the massacre at Saint Barbe, Major Crusius was found guilty of war crimes for the massacre at Saarburg on August 21, 1914. He was accordingly deprived of the right to wear an officer's uniform and was sentenced to two years in a civilian prison. The Laule trial Oberleutnant Adolph Laule stood charged with the killing of Captain Migat of the French Army, who has fallen asleep while his unit marched away. When Oberleutnant Laule and his men had come upon the Captain and attempted to take him prisoner, Migat had resisted, had shaken off the Germans who were attempting to restrain him, and had been shot in the back while running away. The court ruled, however, that Oberleutnant Laule had not fired the fatal shot or ordered his men to shoot. They had acted on their own, without orders. As a result, Oberleutnant Laule was found not guilty. The Cassel trial Lieutenant-General Hans von Schack and Major-General Benno Kruska were charged with 1,280 counts of murder, for their actions during a 1915 typhus outbreak at a POW camp at Cassel. The court noted, however, that out of eighteen German doctors assigned to the camp, only two failed to catch the disease and that four of them died from it. Also, thirty-four German guards at the camp had also caught typhus during the outbreak. The court ultimately ruled that, \\"what most contributed to the outbreak of the epidemic was the order of the Camp Commandant that the Russians were to be placed with the other prisoners. The responsibility for this, however, rests exclusively with the High Command of the Army. An order for this was given by the War Office on 18th October 1914, and this order states that it was advisable to place the Russian prisoners with their Allies, the English and French. From the medical point of view, the doctor at the camp made representations against this... The higher authorities insisted on their order, and the parties concerned had nothing to do but obey.\\"Yarnall (2011), p. 192. In acquitting both defendants, the court declared, \\"General Kruska, as well as General von Schack, is as the State Attorney has himself said, to be acquitted absolutely... The trial before this Court has not revealed even a shadow of proof for these monstrous accusations.\\"Yarnall (2011), pp. 192‚Äì193. Response Even though the sentenced were based on those given for the offenses under German military law, outside of the Weimar Republic, the trials were seen as a travesty of justice because of the small number of cases tried and the perceived leniency of the judges in passing sentence.Yarnall 2011, pp. 194‚Äì95. According to lawyer and historian Alfred de Zayas, however, \\"Generally speaking, the German population took exception to these trials, especially because the Allies were not similarly bringing their own soldiers to justice.\\"De Zayas (1989), p. 5. After Sergeant Karl Heynen was sentenced to ten months imprisonment, the Leipzig correspondent of the London Times' called the trial \\"a scandalous failure of justice\\". One British MP called for the trials to be moved to London. Another declared that the \\"contemptible\\" sentence given to Sergeant Heynen had reduced the trials to \\"a judicial farce\\".Yarnall (2011), p. 194. In response, the German Gazette commented, \\"The first verdict in the series of Leipzig trials has agitated public opinion in two great countries, Germany and England, in apparently sharply contrasting ways. The degree of punishment has been criticised in England in a way that is in the highest degree wounding to German sensibilities.\\"Quoted in Yarnall 2011, p. 194. Even though massacres of German POWs after they surrendered and were disarmed was common practice among soldiers from every Allied Army on the Western Front, Niall Ferguson (1999), The Pity of War: Explaining World War I, pages 371-386. French Prime Minister Aristide Briand was so outraged by the aquittal of Lieutenant-General Stenger for the two POW massacres that the French Mission observing the trials was recalled in protest.Yarnall (2011), p. 194. Within Germany, on the other hand, the trials were seen as excessively harsh for several reasons: * The accused seemed in several cases to have been only following orders; merely trying to perform their duty under difficult conditions. * Several of the charges seemed spurious. * Imprisonment in a civilian jail was regarded as insulting to military men. On 15 January 1922, a commission of Allied jurists, appointed to inquire into the trials, concluded that it was useless to proceed with them any further and recommended that the remaining accused should be handed over to the Allies for trial.Yarnall 2011, pp. 195‚Äì6. This was not done, and the trials were quietly abandoned. Claud Mullins, however, who had observed the trials on behalf of the British Government, argued that the trials needed to be understood in light of the pre-1945 German attitude towards authority. He commented, \\"I always think that it is significant that there are notices in many German railway carriages that, 'In case of a dispute as to whether the window should be open or closed, the guard will decide.' Germans have a respect for authority which we British can scarcely understand.\\"Yarnall (2011), p. 195. Mullins further argued that even brief terms in a civilian prison, rather than detention in a fortress, which was the usual punishment under German military law, were a far harsher sentence than people in Allied countries realized because of the very intense humiliation involved. \\"Six months in a civil jail,\\" he wrote, \\"thus meant far more than three years detention in a fortress, which is the usual military punishment. The Germans have always had strange ideas about service 'honour' and this 'honour' was deeply wounded by a sentence of imprisonment, such as mere civilians received.\\" Mullins concluded, \\"None the less the fact remains that these trials were neither 'a travesty of justice' nor a 'farce.' There was throughout a genuine desire to get to the bottom of the facts and to arrive at the truth. This and the fact that a German Court condemned the doctrines of brutality, which General von Fransecky and Admiral von Trotha applauded, are the important results that will live in history long after the miserable offenders have been forgotten.\\" Ottoman military tribunals The effort to prosecute Ottoman war criminals was also taken up by the Paris Peace Conference, and ultimately included in the Treaty of S√®vres (1920) with the Ottoman Empire. However, Armenian historian Vahakn N. Dadrian comments that the Allied efforts at prosecution were an example of \\"a retributive justice [that] gave way to expedience of political accommodation\\".Dadrian, History of the Armenian Genocide, pp. 310‚Äî11. Even so, Armenian poetPeter Balakian describes the Turkish courts martial as \\"a milestone in the history of war- crimes tribunals.\\"On April 24, the world must remember victims of Armenian genocide, Times Union Legacy Although largely regarded as a failure at the time, the Leipzig trials were the first attempt to devise a comprehensive system for prosecution of violations of international law. During the Second World War, Allied governments again decided to try, after the war, defeated Axis leaders for war crimes committed during the war. These initiatives eventually led to the Nuremberg Trials and International Military Tribunal for the Far East. Following the end of the Cold War, the same trend led to the establishment of the International Criminal Court in 2002.

(1986). Investigating the Unexplained. Prometheus Books. pp. 59-65. Early life The son of William Lingham Lees (1818‚Äì1880) and Elizabeth (n√©e Patch) (1819‚Äì1883), Robert Lees was born in Hinckley and spent his early years in Birmingham. It is claimed that, following the death of Prince Albert in 1861 the 13-year-old Lees went into a trance and communicated messages from Albert to Queen Victoria. It is further claimed that Lees lived for a period in Buckingham Palace so that Victoria could regularly talk to her beloved Albert through him.Gonz√°lez-Wippler, Migene 'What Happens After Death: Scientific & Personal Evidence for Survival' Published by Llewellyn Publications, U.S. pgs 100‚Äì101 (1997) Lees in the Leicester Chroicler None of these claims have been substantiated. The only Royal connection that has been uncovered between Lees and the Royal Family is a letter dated 23 January 1899 sent to Lees from the Privy Office thanking him for sending the Queen a copy of his book Through The Mists.'Robert James Lees and The Psychic Hunt For Jack The Ripper' The Whitechapel Society 1888 website In December 1871 Lees married Sarah Ann Bishop (1850‚Äì1912), whom he had first met as a boy while attending a Sunday School class in the Aston district of Birmingham. They had sixteen children, ten of whom survived to adulthood. In 1876 he moved to Manchester where he worked as a journalist for the Manchester Guardian. In 1878 Lees and his family moved to London, where he worked as a journalist in Fleet Street and where he befriended W.T. Stead. He worked on several London-based publications including George Newnes' Tit-Bits magazine.Biography on the R J Lees website Spiritualist Lees claimed to have had his first psychic experience aged three. He later wrote: > \\"I am personally aware that as a child I cried at being left in the darkness > unless I saw a mysterious and to others invisible kilted Highlander who > remained beside me talking or singing till I fell asleep. And even now, > after a lapse of half a century the vivid memory of his strong but kindly > face is as freshly recalled as if he had sat beside me whilst this New Year > was born.\\" Despite having had little formal education, Lees wrote a series of spiritualist books which continued to sell many years after his death. He claimed that these books had been dictated to him by friends from the spirit realm, and referred to himself as the Recorder. The best known is the three- volume series 'The Mists Trilogy' (Through the Mists, The Life Elysian, The Gate of Heaven), written between 1898 ‚Äì 1931. The Heretic was written as his only autobiographical novel which was a record of his many years in London. An Astral Bridegroom was a study into reincarnation.biography on Answers.comLees on the Revealing the Silence website Skeptics consider his psychic claims to be the result of self-delusion.Stein, Gordon. (1996). The Encyclopedia of the Paranormal. Prometheus Books. p. 585. Jack the Ripper At the time of the Jack the Ripper murders in 1888, Lees was living in the London area.Robert James Lees & Visions From Hell? by Jennifer D. Pegg on the Casebook:Jack the Ripper website His diary entries for 1888 reveal that on 2 October, during a month when no Ripper murders took place, Lees went to both the City of London Police and Scotland Yard offering his assistance in catching Jack the Ripper. However, he was turned away as a madman on both occasions, though Scotland Yard offered to write to him.Lees diary of 1888, in the Archive at Stansted Hall ‚Äì The College For Psychic Science One story, frequently quoted in books and films on the subject, is that Lees, using his psychic power, led the police to Jack the Ripper. This story first appeared in print on 28 April 1895, in The Chicago Herald. Another version of the same story was also published in The People on 19 May 1895. The Chicago Herald article claimed that, over a number of years, Lees had been troubled by psychic visions of Jack the Ripper killing his victims. Each of these visions came true. Lees became disturbed by the visions and sought medical advice, going abroad as a result, where he no longer had the visions. Back in London, he and his wife Sarah were travelling on an omnibus when a man got on at Notting Hill. Lees turned and told his wife that the man was Jack the Ripper. Even though his wife laughed at him, when the man got off the bus at Marble Arch, Lees followed him. Finding a police constable on the way, Lees told him of his suspicions, but the constable also laughed at him. After more murders, Lees was able to convince the police of the truth of his visions and led them to a fashionable house in London, which was home to a noted physician who had treated members of the Royal Family.Odell, Robin. (2006). Ripperology: A Study of the World's First Serial Killer and a Literary Phenomenon. Kent State University Press. p. 159 ] On being found in incriminating circumstances, the doctor was put in a lunatic asylum under the name of Thomas Mason 124, and a mock funeral held. According to the Chicago Herald, the tale had been related by a Dr. Howard of London, who, when drunk, had told the story to a man who then told the newspaper. Ripperologists disregard the story as a hoax. Obvious errors in the Chicago Herald story include the claim there had been 17 murders that took place over a number of years, but the actual number of Ripper victims was just five, with the actual murders occurring in just a few months in the Autumn of 1888. Melvin Harris in his book Jack the Ripper, The Bloody Truth provides convincing evidence that the story was a hoax. He believes that the hoaxers were the Whitechapel Club, Chicago. The offices of the club at that time were behind those of the Chicago Herald. According to Harris, the police had \\"denied that Lees was involved with the Ripper hunt. In fact, Robert Lees's own diary entries contradict this part of the tale. They show that he didn't approach the police until October 2, 1888 three days after the murders on the twenty-ninth.\\" In 1976, the Lees/Ripper story came into prominence again with the publication of Stephen Knight's book Jack the Ripper: The Final Solution. Ian Sharp had rediscovered the Chicago Herald article while researching Jack the Ripper for a BBC documentary that had been screened before the publication of Knight's book. The publication of The Final Solution saw the first time that the Chicago Herald article officially had been quoted in a major publication since The People had quoted it in 1895. Later years In 1902 Lees moved to Ilfracombe in Devon with his family from Plymouth and remained there until about 1928, when he returned to Leicester. Lees died at his home, 'Hazelhurst', Fosse Road South, Leicester, in 1931 at the age of 81 years. His body was cremated at Gilroes Cemetery and his ashes were interred in the grave of his wife in Score Woods Cemetery at Ilfracombe. A blue plaque to commemorate Lees was commissioned by the Hinckley Civic Society and was unveiled by a descendant of Lees on Saturday 2 May 2009.Plaque to Robert James Lees unveiled In fiction Robert James Lees has been depicted in several works on fiction related to the Jack the Ripper case. In the 1979 film Murder by Decree starring Christopher Plummer as Sherlock Holmes, Lees was played by Donald Sutherland.Murder by Decree (1979)] on the Internet Movie Database In the 1988 ITV mini-series Jack the Ripper starring Michael Caine, Lees was played by actor Ken Bones.Jack the Ripper (1988)] on the Internet Movie Database He is a character in the comic book From Hell, written by Alan Moore, although he is omitted from its film adaptation. In the graphic novel, Lees is portrayed as a charlatan, though he is ultimately ‚Äì and unwittingly ‚Äì instrumental in helping Chief inspector Abberline in identifying the Ripper.From Hell : a discussion of the Moore/Campbell series Interestingly, though this version of Lees admits privately that his visions were false, he also says that they all turned out to be true.

The June 2001 issue of Art in America, featured an article by Janet Koplos on his work. Abraham David Christian has been described as an \\"international artist whose work cannot be confined to any one country or defined by any one culture. Geometrical and shape-of-life forms reference the traditions of Eastern, Western, African and American cultures, even as they remain perfectly unique unto themselves. His paper and bronze sculptures convene the spirits of Renaissance art (Donatello and Michelangelo), the Classical abstract art of the avantgarde in the twentieth century (Giacometti, Brancusi, and David Smith), the most (so-called) ‚Äòprimitive‚Äô objects from the smallest villages in Africa, and the most (so- called) ‚Äòrefined‚Äô goddess or Buddha from India, Southeast Asia, or Japan. It is work that is both irrepressible and restrained, libidinal and Minimal, fragile and, of late, monumental. Before the term ‚Äòmulticultural‚Äô ever existed, Christian's sculptures and drawings took for their most basic premises the ‚Äòlanguage [or languages] of man‚Äô and the ‚Äòways of the world.‚Äô Work by the artist is represented in permanent collections worldwide, including the Neue Nationalgalerie, Berlin, the Museum Ludwig, Cologne, the St√§del Museum, Frankfurt, the Staatsgalerie Stuttgart, the Kunstmuseen Krefeld, the Wilhelm Lehmbruck Museum Duisburg, the Kunstmuseum Bonn, the Sprengel Museum Hannover, the Weserburg Museum f√ºr moderne Kunst Bremen, the Kunsthalle Mannheim, the Kunstmuseum D√ºsseldorf, the Museum K√ºppersm√ºhle f√ºr Moderne Kunst Duisburg, The Museum of Modern Art New York City, the Busch- Reisinger Museum Cambridge, MA, the Centre Pompidou Paris, the Mus√©e des Beaux Arts, Calais, the FRAC Collection, France, the National Museum of Modern Art, Tokyo, the Japanese Sword Museum Tokyo, the Tokyo Bijutsu Club, Tokyo, the Museum of Modern Art, Kamakura & Hayama, Fukuyama Museum of Art, Fukuyama, The Museum of Modern Art, Gunma, Takasaki and in company collections including the Fuji Xerox Collection, Tokyo, the Obayashi Corporation Collection, Tokyo, the Sammlung Nationalbank, Essen, the Sammlung Deutsche Bank, Frankfurt/M, the Munich Re Art Collection, Munich. Abraham David Christian has lectured at Keio University, Tokyo; Yamaguchi University, Yamaguchi-Shi, Japan; China Academy of Art, Hangzhou, China; the National university, Seoul, Korea; and extensively in Europe and the United States.

It is part of Solent and Southampton Water Ramsar site and Special Protection Area. It is an important refuge for both surface feeding and diving ducks and functions as an integral part of the marshland system of the west Solent. Location Sowley Pond is situated on the southern edge of the New Forest, approximately 1 km from the Solent and is midway between Lymington and Bucklers Hard. The road crossing the dam that was constructed to form the pond is part of the Solent Way long-distance footpath. History Sowley Pond was formed in the fourteenth century by monks from nearby Beaulieu Abbey who dammed the Crockford stream, which rises on Beaulieu Heath, to form a fishery. During the seventeenth and eighteenth centuries, the pond was used to supply water for an ironworks situated on the opposite side of the road on what is now Sandpit Lane. The Ironworks The Sowley ironworks were completed in the 1590s by the Earl of Southampton. It had a tenuous existence during the 17th century, but with the rapid expansion of Portsmouth dockyard the works were taken over by Henry Corbett, a specialist blacksmith from London, who set up a forge at Beaulieu in conjunction with Sowley. He was financed by Edmund Dummer, a former surveyor of the Navy, and naval contracts for wrought iron followed. Corbett died in 1708 and Dummer continued the business until 1712 when he went bankrupt and his brother Thomas (an ex-navy purser) continued to supply the navy until 1716. By the 1790s, the ironworks were leased by Charles Pocock who lived at the adjacent Sowley House but the ironworks became uneconomic and ceased operating after the Napoleonic Wars. The forge continued to operate until about 1822. At various times a water powered blast furnace existed as well as (intermittently) a finery forge. In the 1750s an air furnace was built. Today, the site of the furnace is indicated by a patch of reddened earth, around which is a heavy concentration of furnace slag. The site of the forge is near the edge of a hollow (wheelpit) below the dam,Jeremy Greenwood. A history of the ironworks at Sowley.2005. where heavy concentrations of forge cinder marks are evident. There is a local saying that \\"the Sowley hammer can be heard\\" which means that rain is on the way. Sowley House The house, which is situated to the south of the pond, is privately owned and not open to the public. In 2001, it was occupied by Otto and Catharina van der Vorm, from the Netherlands. The gardens have large quantities of rare orchids and wild flower meadows which extend down to the Solent shore. The former Forge Hammer Inn adjacent to the house and ironworks was used by smugglers in the eighteenth century to hide contraband. The goods were landed at nearby Pitts Deep Hard and hidden in the cellars of the inn. During one raid by the coastguard the landlady was despatched to divert the coastguards while the tubs of illicit brandy were moved from their hiding place in the chimney to the safety of a nearby copse of trees. \\"The landlady advanced upon them. Singling out one of the officers who owed her a score for...liquid refreshment, she abused him roundly for not paying his debts...\\" When the contraband was safe, the landlady admitted the coastguard, who found nothing, and were once more abused for interfering with the business of honest citizens. Flora Among the tree and plant species found at Sowley are: *Oak *Scots pine *Hazel *Common hawthorn *Butcher‚Äôs broom *Wood spurge *Early purple orchid *Lesser quaking-grass Fauna Sowley is the home to many species of bird, including: *Mallard *Eurasian wigeon *Eurasian teal *Tufted duck *Common pochard *Great crested grebe *Grey heron The heronry at Sowley is one of the largest in Hampshire; in 2018 this held 17 occupied nests. Variable damselfly also breed at Sowley Pond. In the 1900s, King Edward VII presented a pair of sika deer to John, the second Baron Montagu of Beaulieu. This pair escaped into Sowley Wood and were the basis of the large herds of sika to be found in the forest today. They were so prolific that culling had to be introduced in the 1930s to control numbers.

It was opened on July 15, 1905, after a dam had been completed near the village of Czocha. The dam was constructed between 1901 - 1905, by the government of Kingdom of Prussia‚Äôs Province of Silesia. Most workers employed during construction came from Austria and Italy, and total cost was estimated at 1,270,00 reichsmarks. The dam is 45 m high, its length is 130 m, and its thickness - 8 m on top. Total area of the lake is 140 hectares, and volume - 15 million cubic metres. The length of the lake is around 7 km, and it is up to 1 km wide. Between 1905 and 1907, a hydroelectric power plant was built there, for 800,000 marks, funded by the government of Silesia. Currently, it is the oldest plant of this kind in Poland, with six J.M.Voith 1906 turbines still working.

It was premiered at Sarah Lawrence College on May 9, 1950. Although the opera was received positively, the composer was unhappy with the work and declined to have it performed again. However, he did adapt part of the opera into a symphony of the same title in 1951.The Triumph of St. Joan Symphony naxos.com The symphony was later renamed Seraphic Ode. Dello Joio returned to the subject of Joan of Arc in 1955 when he was commissioned by the NBC Television Opera Theatre to produce an original 75-minute opera for television. The resulting work in two acts was retitled The Trial at Rouen, and, in using new music and a new libretto by Dello Joio, was in effect a completely different musical drama from its predecessor. It premiered on April 8, 1956 on NBC. Dello Joio adapted the work a third time, extending the music at the beginning and end of the 1956 version (including some music from the 1950 opera) to create a one-act opera for the stage. This third version, once again called The Triumph of St. Joan, was premiered by the New York City Opera on April 16, 1959. 1950 opera and 1951 symphony Joan of Arc at the coronation of Charles VII of France as depicted by Ingres in this 1851 painting Dello Joio was on the faculty of Sarah Lawrence College (SLC) and the college was looking to produce a theatrical work that could be a collaborative project across different departments. The composer had been contemplating writing an opera for a number of years already but had not found a subject matter that inspired him until attending the 1948 film Joan of Arc with his friend Joseph Machlis, a writer, musician, and Queens College, City University of New York, faculty member. The two men both agreed that an opera focusing on the \\"inner motivations and spiritual life of Joan\\" could be derived effectively and movingly and that it would make a good project for SLC. Over the next 11 months the two men laboured together to create the opera's libretto and Dello Joio composed the music in this time as well. The original 1950 opera encompassed three soloists, an opera chorus, and dancers. The SLC's music and dance departments made up the cast and the production was accompanied by two pianos. The school's theatre majors specializing in the technical aspects of the stage designed and built the sets, lights, and costumes. Conductor Hugh Ross directed the chorus and all told a total of 85 SLC students were involved in putting the opera together. A grant from the Whitney Foundation provided much of the financial backing needed to mount the opera. The opera premiered at Bates Hall on the campus of SLC on May 9, 1950. Gisela Weber created the title role with Jerome Swinford as Pierre Cauchon and John Druary as the Dauphin of France/Charles VII of France. The opera opens with Joan in her prison cell after her trial and sentence of execution. Awaiting her death alone, her memories of past events come to life on stage with intermittent periods returning her to her present moment of solitude. Flashbacks include her meeting with the Dauphin the day before the Siege of Orl√©ans, his coronation at Rheims, the breach in the relationship between Charles and Joan, and Cauchon's condemning of her at her trial. Music critics Olin Downes noted the following about the integral part of chorus: > The chorus plays a many-sided role. Now, in the solitude of Joan's cell, it > is the whispering voice of her sorely tired spirit; now it is active and > potent participant in the drama, as in the coronation scene, or in the scene > between Joan and the Bishop of Beauvaris, denouncing her; now it is the > Greek commentator on the tragedy. Overall the reception for Dello Joio's first rendition of The Triumph of St. Joan was positive. However, the composer was himself unhappy with the work and, although there was some interest in a professional staging of the opera, Dello Joio withdrew the work from such considerations. He did take some of the music and adapt it into a symphony which was first performed by the Louisville Orchestra on December 5 and 6, 1951. At the premiere, renowned dancer Martha Graham performed the role of Joan of Arc using her own choreography. The symphony is organized into three movements. The first movement, entitled \\"The Maid\\", is a theme and variation in 6/8 with flute and oboe soloists on the melody. The second movement, \\"The Warrior\\", is written in 12/8 with a great deal of intensity until it moves into a stately 4/4. Of the final movement, \\"The Saint\\", Dello Joio said, \\"I cannot urge you strongly enough to have the orchestra sing the last movement. I do not feel the end of this piece should be tragic but rather one of triumphant serenity. Joan must have welcomed the fire for it was the final test which led to her salvation.\\" The Trial at Rouen Manuscript portrait of Bishop Pierre Cauchon at the trial of Joan of Arc Peter Herman Adler of the NBC Opera Theatre was interested in Dello Joio's work and in 1955 he commissioned the composer to provide the company with a new opera for television. Feeling he had not said what he wanted to say about Joan of Arc, Dello Joio returned to her as the source of this new work. He wrote an entirely new libretto in two acts, going back to the historical documents of her trial as a source for the new text. He also wrote completely new music for the opera. Dello Joio commented on this process: > The Trial at Rouen is not a version of my first opera, but is a completely > new statement, both musically and dramatically; though the temptation to use > the old material was great... The premise of my opera is simple. My > conclusion is that the Joan story recounts the ageless conflict between the > individual of excessive imagination and those who hold to the status quo. I > was aware of how dangerous this concept was, because singing philosophy can > be a bore. But, in reading the intense human drama between Joan and her > accusers leaped forth from the pages in highly emotional terms. In The Trial of Rouen, Dello Joio completely removed the character of the Dauphin of France/Charles VII of France, choosing instead to focus on Joan's trial and execution. The production starred soprano Elaine Malbin in the title role, baritone Hugh Thompson as Cauchon, bass Chester Watson as Father Julien, and baritone Paul Ukena as the Jailer. There were also six inquisitors and three heavenly voices in the cast. Peter Herman Adler conducted the Symphony of the Air for the production. The opera was broadcast nationally on NBC television on April 8, 1956, to an audience in the millions. Music critic Howard Taubman was overall positive about the work, stating that \\"The NBC Television opera gave The Trial at Rouen a brilliant production, one of the best in a growing line of video presentations.\\" However, his comments on the effectiveness of the work were mixed. He said the following in his review in The New York Times: > The Trial at Rouen is a high-minded attempt to come to grips with the > subject of the martyrdom of Saint Joan. Its mood is reverent without turning > ponderous. It is always lyrical and occasionally tense with drama. It > combines words and music with an ease that makes the enfolding of the song > seem natural and with a poetry that heightens its emotion... Does his opera > give us Joan in all her innocence and radiance? One would have to say it > comes close but is defeated in the end. One of Mr. Dello Joio's troubles is > that his libretto lacks contrast and his characters are almost of one shade. > In the case of Joan, this fault is rectified by variety and subtlety in the > music. However, the music, though it is not afraid to sing, lets us down in > the climaxes by failing to sing with sufficient intensity. 1959 opera Cardinal of Winchester in her prison 1431 by Paul Delaroche (1797‚Äì1856) After the somewhat mixed success of The Trial at Rouen, Dello Joio felt that he could still improve upon his opera further. He continued to work on the opera adding additional music to the beginning and end. He took some music from the original 1950 opera, a short aria for an English sentry (a character in the original opera but not the television version), and tagged it onto the beginning of the first act. He also added an impassioned extended farewell aria for Joan at the end of the opera. Although the work was now longer than the 1956 version, it was structured into one act instead of two. In 1958 Julius Rudel offered to include Dello Joio's revised one-act opera, now retitled The Triumph of St. Joan, in the 1958‚Äì1959 New York City Opera (NYCO) season. He readily accepted and the work was premiered by the NYCO on April 16, 1959, in a double bill with Gian Carlo Menotti's The Medium. The cast included Lee Venora in the title role, Mack Harrell as Cauchon, Chester Watson as Father Julien, Chester Ludgin as the Jailer, and tenor Frank Porretta as the Sentry. Herbert Grossman conducted the opera which was staged by Jos√© Quintero and included sets by David Hays and costumes by Ruth Morely. Taubman also reviewed this production, commenting that this version was \\"a distinct improvement over its predecessors.\\" He also remarked that the opera now had a much more effective climax with the scene where Joan is lashed to the stake \\"taking on a fearful and piteous realism\\".

It is distributed at fashion shows and selected stores as well as published in PDF for its now defunct, though archived, website. The second issue of EVER Manifesto -EVER Bamboo- was released on October 2011. The offices of the magazine are located on the third floor of the Biscuit Building at 10 Redchurch Street, London, England. The founders of the publication (Charlotte Casiraghi, Alexia Niedzielski, and Elizabeth von Guttman) announced its creation, website, and forthcoming debut manifesto in September 2009. The announcement coincided with a press conference for Citt√† dell'arte Fashion: Bio Ethical Sustainable Trend.  Modus operandi  With the catch phrase \\"everlution\\" (a neologism), the website for the magazine declares: \\"Fashion is change and reinvention. Sustainability is just the next step. Break the rhythm of fashion. March to a new drum. The magazine aims to \\"inspire positive transformation in how we live by generating sustainable solutions for both work and play that are aimed at protecting our planet for future generations.\\" The magazine is intended to stimulate thought, debate, and change for improvement. The publication is distributed for free at the 10 Corso Como boutique during Milan Fashion Week and again at Colette in Paris during Paris Fashion Week. Casiraghi explained that the magazine will not have a predetermined publication schedule. \\"We want to publish when we have something to say or people to support,\\" she said.Martin, J.J.: \\"Giving fashion an 'eco- boost,'\\" The New York Times, 24 September 2009 \\"It will be short and meaningful so that people will read it.\\" The staff collaborate with experts and researchers to publish new issues (\\"manifestos,\\" as they call it on the website) when there are new developments. Thus, there is no set schedule for the frequency of publication. Each \\"manifesto\\" will focus on a specific and unique theme that unites the field of science and the arts in a vision of sustainability.  Everlution  The first issue of Ever Manifesto was released in October 2009. It was Guest Edited by Vogue Italia's Franca Sozzani. Contributors included Derek Blasberg, Burak Cakmak, Laura Lazzaroni and Duro Olowu. Everlution focused on consumer attitudes towards sustainability in fashion ‚Äì \\"Just as we have become accustomed to asking the provenance of what we put in our bodies, today the question of where and how the clothes we put on our bodies are made is becoming just as familiar, and as important. Clothes, like art, music and architecture, are a reflection of the time in which they are created. Yet in comparison ‚Äì particularly with that other design discipline that accommodates the body, architecture ‚Äì fashion trails way behind\\". The trio of editors-in-chief (Casiraghi, Neidzielski, and Von Guttman) characterized their project as an attempt to make environmentalism more \\"seductive\\" and, therefore, appealing. Casiraghi said: \\"A manifesto is different from a magazine. It's a very direct form of communication.... We want to show that you can change things. Maybe not the whole world‚Äîbut things.\\"  EVER Bamboo  On 2 June 2011, in anticipation of the upcoming second issue of Ever Manifesto ‚Äì EVER Bamboo- the founders of the publication hosted an event together with Andrea della Valle, and Stefano Tonchi. Artists Mike and Doug Starn were commissioned to create a bamboo structure in Venice. It stretched upwards over the buildings allowing the spectators to see a unique view of the famous Italian city and its channels from within the bamboo structure. On 5 October 2011 Elizabeth von Guttman, Alexia Niedzielski and Charlotte Casiraghi launched EVER Bamboo in Paris. The new issue, guest edited by W's Stefano Tonchi in partnership with Gucci, focuses on bamboo as a sustainable and versatile material. \\"We joined forces with Gucci, the sponsors of this issue, to inspire the next generation of creative talents. Together, we launched a design competition with students from the IFM fashion school in Paris and challenged them to create a bag that incorporated sustainable principles and used bamboo in an innovative way, to be sold online and in selected Gucci boutiques; filmmaker Loic Prigent to document the process from beginning to end.\\" Alongside the launch of EVER Bamboo, Gucci's Creative Director Frida Giannini and the team of Ever Manifesto, in collaboration with l'Institut Fran√ßais de la Mode (IFM), organised a sustainable fashion competition. The three finalists were able to produce prototypes of their bags with the artisans of Gucci Florence. The students were to draw inspiration from the famous Gucci Bamboo Bag, bringing together the values of innovation, charm and authenticity with a low environmental impact. \\"Our mission at Ever Manifesto is to challenge the thought process behind modern creative processes and consumption, and to question how we approach the world that surrounds us so that we can make the world a greener and more ecologically aware place. Bamboo is only one example of how we can curb our use of non-renewable materials; if we all take the time to think about the choices we make, we‚Äôre bound to find better ways to protect our environment while enhancing our wellbeing.\\" The winner of the sustainability contest is Laura Popoviciu, with a handbag model - featured as Vogue America's October issue Style Ethic selection. The ‚ÄúEver Manifesto Bamboo Bag‚Äù was produced by Gucci as a limited edition series available in Gucci boutiques in New York, Paris, Rome, London and Tokyo as well as on gucci.com in France and the US.  EVER Conscious  The third issue of \\"EVER\\" was a compilation of interviews of various artists, celebrities, and thinkers. Although it was the third overall, it was the first issue where Casiraghi was not one of the editors-in-chief. Casiraghi was still listed as a founder, but only Niedzielski and Von Guttman held the title of editor-in-chief for this issue. Lily Cole, Matthew Stone, Fabiola Beracasa Beckman, Claire Nouvian, Daniel Pinchbeck, Eva Kruse, Ben Goldsmith, Daniel de la Falaise, Graham Hill, Pharrell Williams, Mimi Xu, Julie Gilhart, Cecilia Dean and David Selig, Yves B√©har, Dianna Cohen, Amber Valletta, Lewis Perkins, Elettra Wiedemann, Bruno Pieters, and Carsten H√∂ller all were interviewed by editor Xerxes Cook to talk about deeper awareness, mindfulness, and \\"conscious style, transformation, and sustainability as a way of life.\\" Niedzielski and Von Guttman, who are also the founders of the biannual, fashion insider System magazine, told the press that EVER Conscious would be the \\"last manifesto.\\"  See also  * Above magazine * Environmentalism * Environmentally friendly * Reuse * Slow fashion * System magazine  References  External links  * Archival link for Ever Manifesto * Archival link for Ever Bamboo * Archival link for Ever Conscious Category:English-language magazines Category:Environmental magazines Category:Fashion magazines published in the United Kingdom Category:Free magazines Category:Magazines published in London Category:Magazines established in 2009 Category:Irregularly published magazines published in the United Kingdom ","title":"Ever Manifesto"},{"id":"24610074","text":"The 1969 Wightman Cup was the 41st edition of the yearly women's team tennis competition between the United States and Great Britain.

The director of the Illinois Department of Natural Resources, Joel Brunsvold, explained Illinois cycling opportunities: ‚ÄúBicycle riding is one of the most popular outdoor recreational activities in Illinois, enjoyed by young and old alike...Illinois has a variety of trails for the public to enjoy. The terrain includes flat prairie land to rolling hills, towering bluffs to the breathtaking river and lakefront views.‚Äù Many communities across the state are updating bicycle infrastructure in order to accommodate the increased number of cyclists on the roads. Recreation Lake Shore Drive during Bike the Drive Illinois has a lively bike culture with many clubs, groups, and places to ride. One can find a road, cyclocross, and mountain bike racing as well as non-competitive and charity rides across the state. The Illinois Cycling Association promotes amateur bicycle racing by hosting a race calendar and database of racing clubs/team. The types of races listed on the calendar consist of road, criterium, track, and cyclocross. Information about Illinois mountain bike clubs and trails can be found at Illinois Mountain Bike. The site includes links to regional Illinois mountain bike clubs as well as a calendar of events. One of the notable non-competitive bicycle events in Illinois is Bike the Drive. Bike the Drive is an opportunity for cyclists to ride a 15 mile stretch of Lake Shore Drive (Chicago) without any automobile traffic. During the 2009 Bike the Drive, the drive was closed to automobile traffic from 5:30 am to 10:30 am. Each cyclist chooses his own route from the 30 mile (round trip) course and rides at his own pace. Riders may ride the course as many times as possible during the specified event time. The ride benefits the Active Transportation Alliance (formerly Chicagoland Bicycle Federation). Laws and rules While there are some Illinois laws specific to bicycles, generally, bicyclists have the same rights and responsibilities as roadway users. Since bicyclists have the same rights, motorists must be aware of and interact with bicyclists appropriately and lawfully. Bicyclists are responsible for obeying all of the applicable rules for motorists as well as obeying all bicycle specific laws when traveling on public roadways. Motorists interacting with bicyclists Motorists are legally obligated to: * yield to bicyclists' right of way * pass bicyclists slowly and allow at least 3 feet * not park or drive in designated bike lanes * allow incoming bicyclist on the right to pass before proceeding with a right turn * stay behind bicyclists until a left turn is completed (when sharing a left turn lane) * check for passing bicyclists before opening a vehicle door * not follow bicyclists too closely, and be prepared to stop. Bicyclists interacting with motorists Bicyclists are required to adhere to Illinois traffic laws unless otherwise specified. In addition, there are rules governing bicyclists' behavior in certain situations. =Lane position= When traveling at a slower speed than vehicular traffic, bicyclists must ride as close to the right-hand edge as is safe and practical. Exceptions include: when passing another bicycle or vehicle traveling in the same direction, when preparing for a left turn, when necessary to avoid objects or road hazards, when traveling on a road of width too narrow for bicycles and motorized vehicles to safely travel side by side, when preparing for an authorized right hand turn, when traveling on a one lane road with two or more lanes (bicyclist can ride on left-hand side). =Left turns= When preparing for a left turn, a bicyclist may choose from two styles of turns: vehicular and pedestrian. A vehicular-style turn, as the name implies, mimics the procedure of the motor vehicle. The bicyclist moves (after signaling) to the left turn lane or left side of the lane (in the absence of a left turn lane). Proceed with the turn according to traffic signals. When executing a pedestrian-style turn, the bicyclist remains on the right-hand side of the roadway and proceeds through the cross street, stopping at the corner. From this point, the bicyclist may proceed in the new direction, yielding to traffic and obeying traffic signals. =Hand signals= Bicyclists must use hand signals when preparing to turn or stop. Signal a left turn by extending the left arm horizontally. Signal a right turn by: # extending the left arm, bending at the elbow, and extending the forearm upward. # extending the arm horizontally (only legal for bicyclists, not motorists). Signal slowing/stopping by extending the left arm horizontally, bending at the elbow, and pointing down with a flat/open hand. = Riding at night = Riding a bicycle at night requires special attention. When operating a bicycle at nighttime, a bicycle must be equipped with (and be operating) a functional, white lamp that is visible from at least 500 ft. In addition, the bicycle must be mounted with an Illinois Department of Transportation approved, red reflector visible from 100 ‚Äì 600 ft.  Advocacy  Advocacy groups exist to promote the needs and interests of bicyclists. The needs of bicyclists include improving riding conditions/access, educating cyclists about laws and safety, educating motorists about laws and safety, and sharing the benefits of riding a bike with the general public. The League of Illinois Bicyclists is a major, statewide advocacy group. Its vision and mission statements follow. :\\"Illinois - Land of Safe and Enjoyable Bicycling for all. The League of Illinois Bicyclists is the statewide advocate for all Illinois bicyclists, promoting bicycle access, education, and safety.\\" Formerly the Chicagoland Bicycle Federation, the Active Transportation Alliance has broadened its vision and mission statement and is now a Chicago-based advocacy group that promotes the interests of bicycling, walking and public transit. :\\"The mission of Active Transportation Alliance is to make bicycling, walking and public transit so safe, convenient and fun that we will achieve a significant shift from environmentally harmful, sedentary travel to clean, active travel. We advocate for transportation that encourages and promotes safety, physical activity, health, recreation, social interaction, equity, environmental stewardship, and resource conservation.\\" Bikeways Illinois has both multi-use and dedicated bike paths throughout the state. IDOT (Illinois Department of Transportation) provides nine regional interactive maps. The maps include information on the location of dedicated bike infrastructure. Also, included is an assessment of the bike friendliness of public roadways. According to the League of Illinois Bicyclists, these IDOT maps are the best place for information about rural roadways.

Lvov, an amateur of Rurikid lineage, was a polymathBohlman, p. 45. who contributed to geology, history, graphic arts and poetry, but is known primarily as an architect and ethnographer, compiler of the first significant collection of Russian folk songs (the Lvov-Prach collection). Lvov's architecture represented the second, \\"strict\\" generation of neoclassicism stylistically close to Giacomo Quarenghi.Shuisky, p. 128. Lvov worked in Saint Petersburg but his best works survived in the countryside, especially his native Tver Governorate. He redesigned the external appearance of Peter and Paul Fortress and created an unprecedented Trinity Church combining a Roman rotunda with one-of-a-kind pyramidal bell tower. He adapted rammed earth technology to the environment of Northern Russia and used it in his extant Priory Palace in Gatchina; Lvov's construction school, established in 1797, trained over 800 craftsmen. He managed geological surveys and published a treatise on the coals from Donets Basin and Moscow Basin. He experimented with coal pyrolysis, proposed new uses for coal tar and sulphur, and wrote a reference book on heating and ventilation. Lvov designed the badges of the Order of St. Vladimir and the Order of St. Anna, translated works by Anacreon, Palladio, Petrarch, Sappho and the Saga of King Harald into Russian language, wrote libretto for opera and vaudeville, researched Russian chronicles and published one of the first versions of the bylina of Dobrynya Nikitich. In 1783 he became one of the first 36 members of the Russian Academy. In 1931 Vladislav Khodasevich called Lvov \\"an intelligent and subtle connoisseur of everything ... who was not destined to do anything remarkable.\\"Khodasevich, pp. 86. Later researchers appreciated Lvov's contribution: Richard Taruskin considered Lvov's collection of folk songs \\"the greatest and most culturally significant of Russian folk collections\\", Philip Bohlman credited discovery of Russian folk art \\"all from the actions of a single individual, Lvov\\",Bohlman, p. 44. William Craft Brumfield called Lvov \\"one of the greatest neoclassical architects produced in the reign of Catherine the Great... neoclassical aesthetics at its purest\\".Brumfield, p. 181. Early years Maria Lvova, n√©e Dyakova (Dmitry Levitzky, 1778) Nikolay Lvov, descendant of the Rurikid Lvov princely family, was born in an impoverished country estate 16 kilometers from Torzhok.Glinka, Lappo-Danilevsky Sources published before 2001 state date of birth March 4, 1751; in 2001 Galina Dmitrieva published newly found church records showing that Lvov was actually born May 4, 1753. In line with tradition parents \\"enrolled\\" Nikolay into Preobrazhensky Lifeguard regiment in 1759. Ten years later Nikolay arrived in Saint Petersburg and joined the regiment. In 1770‚Äì1771 he attended training courses at Izmaylovsky Regiment; these courses were the only instance of formal education in his life. Until 1775 Lvov, along with his military service that became a mere formality, was also employed by the Collegium of Foreign Affairs as a diplomatic courier and extensively travelled to German principalities and Denmark. In July 1775 Lvov resigned both military and civil service in the rank of captain and returned to his parents' estate, but one year later returned to diplomatic service. This time he travelled to London, Madrid, Paris and the Netherlands; in Paris Lvov indulged in frequent theatre going and made good acquaintance with poet Ivan Khemnitser and the Bakunin family. Back in Saint Petersburg Lvov created a private theatre based in the Bakunin house and played lead parts in plays by Jean-Fran√ßois Regnard, Antonio Sacchini and, probably, Yakov Knyazhnin. He led otherwise a modest lifestyle of a salaried clerk, living at his friends' houses, and could not afford renting his own until May 1779 when his pay was raised to 700 roubles per annum. Around 1778 or 1779 Lvov developed relationship with Maria Dyakova (her sister Alexandra was engaged to Vasily Kapnist). Maria's father, an influential statesman, distrusted Lvov at first sight and ruled out any marriage proposals. She and Lvov were secretly married in a church in Saint Petersburg on November 8, 1780;Glinka, Lappo-Danilevsky. Other sources date the secret marriage 1779. Maria still lived in her parents' house for three more years. By 1783 Lvov's social standing improved to the point where the father reluctantly approved the marriage; only then the secret ceremony of 1780 became public. The affair between Lvov and Maria Dyakova became a subject of romance novel fiction (the most recent paperback was issued in 2008). In April 1781 Lvov was appointed secretary to the Russian Embassy in Dresden, Kingdom of Saxony, but \\"her majesty's will\\" retained him at Saint Petersburg court. Instead of Dresden he left for Warsaw and Vienna on government business and managed to carve out time for a personal tour of Italy (Livorno, Pisa, Florence, Bologna and Venice).Lvov, Italian diary, dates arrival in Livorno July 7, departure from Venice July 17. During his tour in Italy he met with several influential people associated with the Russian court, including Count Demetrio Mocenigo in Pisa. In May 1783 Lvov transferred from Foreign Affairs to the Directorate of Post Offices, where he served under Alexander Bezborodko until 1797. Most of his achievements in arts and sciences took place alongside government service and clearly took precedence over it, so Lvov's career was not as rapid as that of Gavrila Derzhavin. Poetry and politics Contrary to neoclassical mainstream of his age,Taruskin, p. 4. Lvov as a poet belonged to emerging sentimentalismMoser, p. 110. and pioneered exploration of \\"spontaneous, great-hearted sincerity in the Russian peasant\\" that defined yet unexplored national character. He belonged to a close-knit ring of fellow poets; its key members, Lvov, Derzhavin and Vasily Kapnist, were bonded by their marriages to three Dyakova sisters.Moser, p. 111.Ritsarev, p. 199. Kapnist married Alexandra Dyakova in 1781; Derzhavin married Yekaterina Dyakova in 1795, his second marriage. Lvov, Kapnist and Ivan Khemnitser shaped poetic self-determination of their elder and better known friend DerzhavinMoser, p. 86. whose literary career started in 1779.Khodasevich, p. 88. The group also included painters (Dmitry Levitzky, Vladimir Borovikovsky), musicians (Yevstigney Fomin and probably Dmitry Bortniansky), engravers and publishers; Marina Ritsarev called the Lvov ring \\"another Russian Academy, albeit an informal one\\". Lvov, \\"a matchless connoisseur for his age\\" provided \\"artists of the high culture with worthy models for emulation.\\" Lvov's own verses contain one of the first literary imitations of a folk song, set to the metre of traditional wedding chants later known as Koltsov's metre, a precursor of one of the commonest poetic genres in 19th-century Russian poetryTaruskin, p. 6. and a testimony to an emerging new status of folk art and the very concept of a nation. He composed one of the first literary stories about Dobrynya Nikitich; unlike his contemporary James Macpherson, he never attempted to disguise it as a true folk bylina. Politically, Lvov was an \\"active royalist\\"Ritsarev, p. 206. faithful to Catherine and later Paul I, at the same time he was also loyal to his fraternity; he secured a diplomatic appointment to Khemnitzer,Khodasevich, p. 120. and tried to prevent the 1790 trial of Alexander Radishchev. Lvov as a mature man parted with his affection to Western culture and became \\"sort of a slavophile avant la lettre.\\"Boele, p. 60. He was the first to discover poetic qualities of Russian winter, previously overlooked or denied, and to turn it into a stylistic device.Boele, p. 63. For him, winter became a manly nationalistic symbol of what makes Russians different from their Western and Southern neighbors. In the end, Lvov produced \\"perhaps the most articulate early image of the exuberant Russian soul, and the most explicitly contemptuous of the West\\"Greenfield, p. 257. predating nationalist writing by Nikolai Gogol. Ethnography Sheet music from the 1806 edition of Lvov and Pratsch collection Lvov collaborated with composer Yevstigney Fomin, \\"by far and away the ablest native-born Russian composer of his period\\"Taruskin, p. 7. on a folk singspiel The Coachmen (, 1787), \\"the highest at which Russian opera before Glinka ever aimed\\"Taruskin, p. 12. and \\"astonishingly faithful to those of genuine oral polyphony.\\" The Coachmen was written in 1786 as a one-time event to mark Catherine's visit to Tambov (a new town managed by Lvov's buddy Derzhavin)Ritsarev, p. 201. and contained the first instance of A Birch Stood in the Field () recorded and performed professionally. The song was later used by Mily Balakirev in the Overture on Russian Themes and Pyotr Ilyich Tchaikovsky in the finale of his Fourth Symphony. Lvov's ethnographic activities were marked by a distinct form of nationalism of his age, \\"idealization and flattery of the folk\\";Ritsarev, p. 202. Lvov himself wrote that one of his objectives was to impress \\"present-day philosophers\\" in patriotic virtues of the Russians.Ritsarev, p. 202, cites Lvov's preface to the LPC, translated into English by Margarita Mazo He created the Russian name for a folk song (–Ω–∞—Ä–æ–¥–Ω–∞—è –ø–µ—Å–Ω—è), adopting Herder's concept of Volkslieder. Lvov's preface to his collection of folk poems published in 1790 contains the first professional description of Russian polyphonic folk singing, a knowledge later forgotten and resurrected in the 1870s.Taruskin, p. 13. The book, containing one hundred songs, Collection of Russian Folk Songs with Their TunesEnglish rendition as in Taruskin, p. 16. (–°–æ–±—Ä–∞–Ω–∏–µ –Ω–∞—Ä–æ–¥–Ω—ã—Ö —Ä—É—Å—Å–∫–∏—Ö –ø–µ—Å–µ–Ω —Å –∏—Ö –≥–æ–ª–æ—Å–∞–º–∏) was published at the expense of Her Majesty's CabinetRitsarev, p. 206. Ritsarev noted that engraving sheet music in Lvov's age was prohibitively expensive. and was reissued in 1806 adding 53 new songs;Taruskin, p. 16.Russian editions followed in 1815, 1896, 1955; the 1815 edition was reprinted in the United States in 1987 - Taruskin, p. 16. vulgar or \\"antisocial\\" songs were excluded. The book was co-authored by Ivan Prach (or Jan Praƒç)For a discussion of Prach's obscure identity see Taruskin, p. 17; Ritsarev, p. 201. who transcribed sheet music, and is thus known in the English world as Lvov-Prach collection, shortly LPC.Taruskin, p. 17. One of the songs from the LPC, Glory to the Sun, has been used by Ludwig van Beethoven in the Second Razumovsky Quartet, by Modest Mussorgsky in Boris Godunov and by other composers.Emerson, Oldani p. 41. Verses of yet another song were previously published by Alexander Sumarokov; its LPC version remained a staple of household music throughout the 19th century and was adopted by Mikhail Glinka, Alexander Borodin and Fernando Sor although later critics branded it \\"fake folk\\".Taruskin, p. 20. Margarita Mazo, on the contrary, wrote that LPC material is closer to modern understanding of folk music than scientific, surgical transcriptions of the end of the 19th century, and that the creativity of Lvov and Pratsch \\"influenced the folk tradition itself\\"As cited in Taruskin, p. 24. through numerous songbooks that circulated all over Russia.Taruskin, p. 24. Architecture Trinity Church, Saint Petersburg A list of Lvov's architectural works compiled by Tatarinov contains 87 buildings and country estates,Tatarinov, pp. 372-393 some unconditionally attested through archive evidence, others attributed with different degree of confidence.See Cracraft, Rowland p. 68 for a discussion of typical attribution problems in 18th-century Russian architecture. The first work on this list, interiors of the house for Sophie Dorothea of W√ºrttemberg, the bride of Paul I, was commissioned by Catherine II in the summer of 1776.Tatarinov, pp. 372-373. However, absolute majority of Lvov's works were built for private clients: Bezborodko, Derzhavin, Olenin (Utkina Dacha), Kochubey, the Vorontsov and Vyazemsky families in the 1780s. In 1780, shortly after the meeting of Catherine II and Joseph II in Mogilev, Bezborodko introduced Lvov to the empress. Catherine commissioned Lvov the church of Saint Joseph in Mogilev to commemorate the event,F. P. Lvov, pp. 367-368. the project earned him honorary membership at the Imperial Academy of Arts (1786). The neoclassical rotunda church was built under his supervision until 1798. It became a cathedral in 1802, was converted to a museum in 1934 and demolished in 1937. In the same 1780 Lvov proposed redesign of the Neva Gate of Peter and Paul Fortress in Saint Petersburg; the project materialized in 1784‚Äì1787 and included complete refit of decrepit fortress walls with granite cladding and construction of granite pier in place of an old wooden one. The Tuscan portal of the Neva Gate is ranked among his best, if not the best, architectural works.Shuisky, p. 129. Bell tower of Borisoglebsky Monastery. Photograph by Sergey Prokudin- Gorsky, 1910 In 1783 Lvov designed the new building for his new employer, the Directorate of Post Offices; the block-sized compound, completed in 1789, became his largest project in Saint Petersburg as well as his home: after completion Lvov and his family moved into an apartment on the northern side of the block.Shuisky, p. 130. The building, rebuilt by Yegor Sokolov in the 19th century and Alberto Cavos in the 1850s, stands to date. Bezborodko, chief of the Directorate, remained Lvov's patron and provided him private and public commissions (including the extant Bezborodko Dacha in Saint Petersburg) until his death in 1799.Entries in Tatarinov, pp. 374-375, 382-385 Another high- ranking client, prince Vyazemsky, director of state porcelain factories, commissioned a suburban estate (now within the limits of Saint Petersburg) including Lvov's most unusualShuisky, p. 131. work, the Trinity Church in Aleksandrovskoe also known as Kulich and Paskha (1785‚Äì1787). The main rotunda was probably influenced by the Temple of Vesta; the pyramidal bell tower has no analogues, even remote, in Russian architecture and was a forerunner to the revival of Ancient Egyptian architecture associated with Empire style of the Alexander I period.Shuisky, p. 132. In the same period Lvov designed the cathedral of Borisoglebsky Monastery in Torzhok, a purely Neoclassical five- domed edifice that also contained hints of Russo-Byzantine architecture,Brumfield, pp. 181, 182. a style that emerged decades after Lvov's death. Bell tower of the same monastery became Lvov's last known design; it was started after his death by Fyodor Ananyin and completed in 1811. In 1798 Lvov published the first volume of Russky Pallady, an adapted translation of Andrea Palladio's I Quattro Libri dell'Architettura with Lvov's own lengthy comments.Miliygina It was the second attempt to publish Palladio in Russian, after Prince Dolgorukov's 1699 abstract that circulated only in handwritten copies; the first complete and unabridged Palladio was not published until 1938. Work took eight years: Lvov personally engraved in copper over 200 copies of original engravings from the 1616 Venetian edition, the earliest he could acquire. Lvov wished \\"Palladio's taste to prosper in my country; French twists and English refinement already have plenty of imitators\\" \\\\- Lvov, 1798 as cited by Miliugina (in modern Russian orthography) and particularly criticized French adaptations of Palladianism. Paul I, who ascended to the throne in November 1796, dismissed most of his mother's statesmen but retained Bezborodko in charge of foreign affairs. Paul extended the favor to Lvov and granted him state support and new commissions, although nowhere as significant or lucrative as those awarded to Vincenzo Brenna (Khodasevich: \\"Even under new order Lvov was swimming along like a fish in water\\"Khodasevich, p. 165.). In an ironic twist of fortune, in April 1797 Paul I dispatched Lvov to Moscow to redesign Bartolomeo Rastrelli's modest Grand Kremlin Palace,Schmidt, p. 51. a feat once attempted by Vasili Bazhenov. Lvov produced a vast plan consisting of a three-part neoclassical palace core within a redesigned Gothic revival citadel, \\"an intimate royal villa in a park-like setting.\\"Schmidt, p. 52. His design was not as radical as Bazhenov's 1767 draft that was cancelled by Catherine at an early stage, but shared the same fate. After one year of preliminary work the project was cancelled; all alterations to existing Kremlin buildings done by Lvov were later absorbed into extant Grand Kremlin Palace designed by Konstantin Thon. Technology Lvov's furnace design from Russkaya Pyrostatika, 1793 In 1785 Lvov acquired a helpful associate Adam Menelaws, one of 73 Scottish craftsmen recruited by Charles Cameron, and the future house architect of Nicholas I.Kuznetsov, p. 215For a concise English account of Menelaws life story see Cross, pp. 297-303. Interaction and influence between Lvov and Menelaws are disputed. Andreyev, on one extreme, considered Menelaws completely dependent on Lvov's talent;Kuznetsov, p. 214.See also Cross, p. 300, for a toned-down description of Andreyev's opinion. Kuznetsov, on the other, considered Menelaws to be Lvov's mentor in design and construction management and suggested that Lvov's rammed earth technology was actually developed by Menelaws while Lvov provided a respectable front and palace connections.Kuznetsov, p. 218. The first task assigned to Menelaws was something different: searching for coal deposits in Lvov's native Tver Governorate. Lvov was concerned about Russia's dependence on imported British coals and deforestation caused by charcoal extraction, and gained support of Bezborodko and Vorontsov to survey for fossil coals. In August 1786 Lvov and Menelaws announced the find of commercial quality coal \\"not inferior to that from Newcastle\\" in Borovichi.Cross, p. 298. Menelaws concurrently managed Lvov's construction projects in Torzhok and other places, raising suspicion that coal survey was merely an excuse for appropriating the Scotsman.Kuznetsov, p. 216. Prospecting for coal continued for years, commercial coal mining in Borovichi commenced only eleven years later, after Paul I granted Lvov state support in his business. Lvov arranged shipment of coal by barges to Saint Petersburg, but his coal did not sell well. Unaware of spontaneous combustion hazard, the shippers dumped incoming coal in one lump on the bank of the Neva River; the whole enterprise ended in a spectacular fire. Lvov's interest in fossil coal did not fade completely until at least 1800 when he sent Menelaws to recruit workers and purchase machinery in England.Cross, p. 299. Priory Palace, Gatchina Lvov, concerned with inefficiency of existing heating ovens, designed his own heating system and advertised it through a two-volume treatise on heating and ventilation (–†—É—Å—Å–∫–∞—è –ü–∏—Ä–æ—Å—Ç–∞—Ç–∏–∫–∞ / Russkaya Pyrostatica, 1793). Walls of Lvov's buildings contained elaborate heat exchanging ductwork that gently warmed up incoming outdoor air, heating and ventilating indoor space simultaneously. These ducts became his trademark and were used to identify Lvov's designs, notably the Trinity church. In the 1790s Lvov privately experimented with adopting European rammed earth technology to the environment of Northern Russia. Whether he imported the technology himselfGrigoryeva or relied on Menelaws, the novelty seemed promising and in August 1797 he obtained Paul's consent and state financing to set up a school training local workers in new technology, irrigation and road construction. The main school was located in Lvov's own estate, and a branch in Moscow; in six years it trained 815 men. In the end of 1797 Paul commissioned Lvov to design and build the Priory Palace in Gatchina Park - the largest rammed earth project ever built in Russia. It also used another of Lvov's inventions, a composite roofing material made by impregnating cardboard sheets with coal tar and mineral powders. Paul's manager count Prozorovsky forced Lvov to build the palace literally in a swamp, and the Priory, built literally of dirt and dust, was rated to stand for 25 years only. Contrary to expectations it survived over two hundred years, the neglect of Soviet period and the German attempts to destroy it in World War II.Morgan, Orlova p. 146. The last years The death of Lvov's benefactor Alexander Bezborodko in April 1799 slowed down Lvov's projects; Lvov himself fell ill in September 1800 and barely recovered by April 1801. In July 1801 Lvov wrote that he \\"returned from the other world on crutches\\"Lvov (1994 edition), p. 358 - letter dated July 18, 1801. but managed to get through to the new emperor Alexander I and presented his album on rammed earth construction. The meeting paid back in October 1892, when Alexander granted Lvov the rank of privy councilor and appointed him to the Expedition of State Household. Lvov's health deteriorated again and he left Saint Petersburg for the Caucasus. On his way south he designed and built the foundations for the Stone of Tmutarakan in Taman and wrote a description of mineral springs of Mount Beshtau district. Spa treatment did not help, and he died on the way back, in Moscow. He was buried in a rotunda mausoleum in his native Cherenchitsy that he designed in 1784 and built in the 1790s. Maria died in 1807; their three daughters (Elizaveta, Vera and Praskovya, 14 to 18 years of age in 1807) were raised by Gavrila and Darya Derzhavin.Khodasevich, p. 209. In 1809‚Äì1811 Elizaveta Lvova acted as Derzhavin's secretary and recorded his spoken memoirs.Khodasevich, pp. 217, 229. Lvov's two sons joined imperial service earlier and were not known for anything notable; the fame of Princes of Lvov passed to a different branch of the family. Lvov's cousin Fyodor Petrovich Lvov (1766‚Äì1836), a composer, headed the Imperial Capella in Saint Petersburg.Ritsarev, p. 336. Fyodor's son Aleksey Fyodorovich Lvov (1799‚Äì1870) followed in his father's step and inherited his chair at the Imperial Chapel, but is better known as the author of the imperial Russian national anthem God Save The Tsar! (Bozhe, tsarya khrani).Taruskin, p. xiiiSee also Franklin, Widdis pp. 118-120 for a review of evolution of Russian anthem Hector Berlioz called Aleksey Lvov \\"an eminent musician, who is both virtuoso and composer. His talent as a violinist is remarkable, and his latest work, Ondine, contains beauties of the highest order...\\"As cited in English in Ritsarev, p. 336. Aleksey Lvov also ventured into ethnography, focusing on the historical liturgical singing, and even attempted to enforce, in vain, his vision of historical truth in church music.Ritsarev, pp. 339-340.

The label's name comes from the art term for the use of light and dark in a painting. O'Neal got the name from his friend and mentor Eddie Condon, a jazz musician who played in what were called Chiaroscuro Concerts in the 1930s. O'Neal also got the name from a store that sold only black and white dresses. O'Neal ran the label from 1969‚Äì1977 and produced all but two of the albums. Its catalogue included Earl Hines, Joe Venuti, Teddy Wilson, and Ruby Braff. O'Neal sold the label to Audiophile Enterprises in 1978, then bought back the catalogue when he started SOS Productions in 1987. Chiaroscuro released new discs and reissues through the 1990s. In 2011, Chiaroscuro's founders donated the company to the Northeast Pennsylvania Educational Television Association, owner of WVIA-FM-TV, the PBS and NPR member for northeastern Pennsylvania.

Early history The early history of the manor is obscure, but in a register of lands belonging to the Bishop of Ely compiled in 1277, a certain Walter de Tolymer was tenant-in- chief of lands close to Hatfield Great Park. It is likely that he is the origin of the Tolmers name. A famous lord of the manor was Robert Dudley, 1st Earl of Leicester who held Tolmers from 1566 until his death without heirs in 1588, when his land reverted to the Crown. Legend has it that the young Lady Arbella Stuart was detained there in the custody of the Earl. In 1608, Tolmers was granted to Sir Henry Goodere, a colourful character who was always short of money and given to writing poems to prominent figures in the Royal Household in the hope of advancement. In a petition of 1626 applying for a position at Court, he wrote that he \\"desired only meat, drink and lodging, with some dignity, in that place where I have spent most of my time and estate.\\" He died in the following year. 18th and 19th centuries In 1761, Tolmers Park was in the hands of Sir Frances Vincent, who replaced the Tudor house with the present building in the classical style with an Ionian porch. An Enclosure Act of 1806 allowed part of Northaw Common to be enclosed and planted with specimen trees to form Home Wood. The whole estate was sold at auction in 1834. It was bought by Samuel Mills, of Russell Square, a textile and property magnate, who already owned adjoining land in Cuffley. The estate then passed to his son, Thomas Mills, who was MP for Totnes and then to his other son, John Remington Mills, also an MP (for Wycombe). In 1860, Tolmers was leased to Thomas Bazley, a Manchester cotton mill owner who had been a Royal Commissioner for the Great Exhibition and was MP for Manchester. He became 1st Baronet Bazley of Tolmers in 1869 (motto: Finem Respice). The ownership of the estate eventually passed to Samuel Mills‚Äô two great- granddaughters, one of whom was the novelist Mary Cholmondeley. From 1910 to 1918 the eastern edge of the estate was busy with excavations for the Hertford Loop railway line, one of the last great projects of the railway age. 20th century In World War I the house was used as a military hospital and between the wars was a girls‚Äô boarding school, which had its own Girl Guide Company (1st Tolmers). On an Ordnance Survey map dated 1921, part of Tolmers is shown as a golf course. In 1939, of the estate south of Cuffley Brook was sold to the Boy Scouts Association for use as a campsite. Tolmers Scout Camp was opened on 11 May 1940 by Lord Wigram.The Scout Magazine: June 1940 issue p.162 On the outbreak of World War II, Tolmers Girls School was evacuated, eventually to settle at Beechwood Park near St Albans. The house again became a military hospital, but later in the war the hospital was used for geriatric patients and it continued in this role until the 1980s. When the Health Service finally vacated Tolmers Park, the house (a Grade II Listed BuildingDevelopment Plan ) was refurbished. The estate remains as altered by Ray Franklin, the developer, converted into 16 luxury houses.

During his military career, Pocius has held various positions, including Chief of Staff of Voluntary Service of National Defence, and Commander of the Lithuanian Land Force. Pocius was Lithuanian champion of freestyle wrestling in junior, youth and adult groups. Early years Pocius was born on 14 May 1957 in port city Klaipƒóda, Lithuania. In 1971 as a schoolboy he entered a free-style wrestling section and later became Lithuanian champion in junior, youth and adult groups. In 1975 Pocius graduated from high school and started studies in Physical Education Academy. During the studies he actively participated in sports, especially in judo, Sambo and free-style wrestling. Pocius achieved the name of Honored Master of Sports of USSR (according to Sports Classification System of Soviet Union) in judo and free-style wrestling. In 1979 he graduated from the Academy and worked as a coach of free-style wrestling, later judo. Military career In 1979 after graduation from reserve officer course in Kaliningrad District, USSR, he gained Soviet Army (SA) Mechanized infantry platoon leader qualification and was commissioned to the rank of lieutenant (Reserve). In 1988 while working in Lithuanian Physical Culture and Sports Committee as chief coach of judo and Sambo, Pocius joined Freedom Movement ‚ÄúSƒÖj≈´dis‚Äù as a security guard in so called Green Armlet Group.

Oil on canvas. The Golden Verses (, , ; ) are a collection of moral exhortations comprising 71 lines written in dactylic hexameter. They are traditionally but falsely attributed to Pythagoras. The exact origins of the Golden Verses are unknown and there are varying opinions regarding their dating. It appears that the verses may have been known as early as the third century BCE but their existence as we know them cannot be confirmed prior to the fifth century CE.Joost-Gaugier (2007):60. The Golden Verses enjoyed great popularity and were widely distributed in late antiquity,Joost-Gaugier (2007):106. being often quoted.Kahn (2001):93. Their renown persisted during the medieval ages and into the Renaissance.Joost-Gaugier (2007):60. In 1494 the Neoplatonic Greek scholar Constantine Lascaris published in a famous printed edition of his Grammatica, deliberately, the Golden Verses translated into Latin, thereby bringing them to a widespread audience.Russo (2003-2004): 51-54. The Neoplatonists used the Golden Verses as part of their preparatory program of moral instruction,O'Meara (2005):59. and a number of Neoplatonic commentaries on the verses are extant. The commentary of the Neoplatonist Hierocles of Alexandria on the Golden Verses was first translated into French by Andr√© Dacier (1706) and then into English by Nicholas Rowe (1707); a recent English translation is by Schibli (2002).Schibli (2002):14. The most recent scholarly edition of the Golden Verses is by Thom (1994), who supplies a new English translation.Thom, Johan C. The Pythagorean Golden Verses: With Introduction and Commentary. Brill, 1994. The Golden Verses of Pythagoras (Rowe/Firth translation, modernized) # First worship the Immortal gods, as they are established and ordained by the Law. # Reverence the Oath, and next the Heroes, full of goodness and light. # Honour likewise the Terrestrial Daemons by rendering them the worship lawfully due to them. # Honour likewise your parents, and those most nearly related to you. # Of all the rest of mankind, make him your friend who distinguishes himself by his virtue. # Always give ear to his mild exhortations, and take example from his virtuous and useful actions. # Avoid as much as possible hating your friend for a slight fault. # Power is a near neighbour to necessity. # Know that all these things are just as what I have told you; and accustom yourself to overcome and vanquish these passions:-- # First gluttony, sloth, sensuality, and anger. # Do nothing evil, neither in the presence of others, nor privately; # But above all things respect yourself. # In the next place, observe justice in your actions and in your words. # And do not accustom yourself to behave yourself in any thing without rule, and without reason. # But always make this reflection, that it is ordained by destiny that all men shall die. # And that the goods of fortune are uncertain; and that just as they may be acquired, they may likewise be lost. # Concerning all the calamities that men suffer by divine fortune, # Support your lot with patience, it is what it may be, and never complain at it. # But endeavour what you can to remedy it. # And consider that fate does not send the greatest portion of these misfortunes to good men. # There are many sorts of reasonings among men, good and bad; # Do not admire them too easily, nor reject them. # But if falsehoods are advanced, hear them with mildness, and arm yourself with patience. # Observe well, on every occasion, what I am going to tell you:-- # Do not let any man either by his words, or by his deeds, ever seduce you. # Nor lure you to say or to do what is not profitable for yourself. # Consult and deliberate before you act, that you may not commit foolish actions. # For it is the part of a miserable man to speak and to act without reflection. # But do the thing which will not afflict you afterwards, nor oblige you to repentance. # Never do anything which you do not understand. # But learn all you ought to know, and by that means you will lead a very pleasant life. # In no way neglect the health of your body; # But give it drink and food in due measure, and also the exercise of which it needs. # Now by measure I mean what will not discomfort you. # Accustom yourself to a way of living that is neat and decent without luxury. # Avoid all things that will occasion envy. # And do not be prodigal out of season, like someone who does not know what is decent and honourable. # Neither be covetous nor stingy; a due measure is excellent in these things. # Only do the things that cannot hurt you, and deliberate before you do them. # Never allow sleep to close your eyelids, after you went to bed, # Until you have examined all your actions of the day by your reason. # In what have I done wrong? What have I done? What have I omitted that I ought to have done? # If in this examination you find that you have done wrong, reprove yourself severely for it; # And if you have done any good, rejoice. # Practise thoroughly all these things; meditate on them well; you ought to love them with all your heart. # It is those that will put you in the way of divine virtue. # I swear it by he who has transmitted into our souls the Sacred Quaternion, the source of nature, whose cause is eternal. # But never begin to set your hand to any work, until you have first prayed the gods to accomplish what you are going to begin. # When you have made this habit familiar to you, # You will know the constitution of the Immortal Gods and of men. # Even how far the different beings extend, and what contains and binds them together. # You shall likewise know that according to Law, the nature of this universe is in all things alike, # So that you shall not hope what you ought not to hope; and nothing in this world shall be hidden from you. # You will likewise know, that men draw upon themselves their own misfortunes voluntarily, and of their own free choice. # Unhappy they are! They neither see nor understand that their good is near them. # Few know how to deliver themselves out of their misfortunes. # Such is the fate that blinds humankind, and takes away his senses. # Like huge cylinders they roll back and forth, and always oppressed with innumerable ills. # For fatal strife, natural, pursues them everywhere, tossing them up and down; nor do they perceive it. # Instead of provoking and stirring it up, they ought to avoid it by yielding. # Oh! Jupiter, our Father! If you would deliver men from all the evils that oppress them, # Show them of what daemon they make use. # But take courage; the race of humans is divine. # Sacred nature reveals to them the most hidden mysteries. # If she impart to you her secrets, you will easily perform all the things which I have ordained thee. # And by the healing of your soul, you wilt deliver it from all evils, from all afflictions. # But you should abstain from the meats, which we have forbidden in the purifications and in the deliverance of the soul; # Make a just distinction of them, and examine all things well. # Leave yourself always to be guided and directed by the understanding that comes from above, and that ought to hold the reins. # And when, after having deprived yourself of your mortal body, you arrived at the most pure Aither, # You shall be a God, immortal, incorruptible, and Death shall have no more dominion over you.Firth (1904:1-8).

(February 16, 1892--February 19, 1971) was an American prelate of the Roman Catholic Church. He was the first Bishop of Gallup, New Mexico (1940-1969). Biography Bernard Espelage was born in Cincinnati, Ohio, to Bernard and Clara (n√©e Schottelkotte) Espelage. He received his early education at parochial schools and Franciscan seminaries. He was invested with the Franciscan habit on August 15, 1910, and made his profession as a member of the Franciscan Order on August 15, 1911. He was later ordained to the priesthood in Oldenburg, Indiana, on May 16, 1918. He then served as a curate in Roswell, New Mexico, for a year before becoming chancellor of the Archdiocese of Santa Fe in 1919. In 1926 he earned a Licentiate of Canon Law from the Catholic University of America in Washington, D.C. He served as rector of the Cathedral of St. Francis of Assisi (1934-1939) and afterwards returned to Oldenburg, where he was pastor of Holy Family Church (1939-1940). On July 20, 1940, Espelage was reassigned to New Mexico as the first Bishop of the Diocese of Gallup by Pope Pius XII. He received his episcopal consecration on the following October 9 from Archbishop John T. McNicholas, O.P., with Bishop Joseph H. Albers and Archbishop Joseph Ritter serving as co-consecrators. He attended all four sessions of the Second Vatican Council between 1962 and 1965. During his 29-year-long tenure, he increased the number of Catholics from 30,000 to 79,260; priests from 32 to 108; and parishes from 17 to 53. Espelage retired as Bishop of Gallup on August 25, 1969; he was named Titular Bishop of Penafiel by Pope Paul VI on the same date. He later died at age 79.

A single-engined biplane based on the Sopwith Wallaby long-range aircraft, only a single Antelope was built. Development and design In 1919, the Sopwith Aviation Company developed a three-seat transport aircraft, the Sopwith Antelope, based on its Wallaby long-range aircraft built to compete for a ¬£10,000 prize for an England- Australia flight, which was in turn based on the Sopwith Atlantic, which had crashed during an attempt to be the first aircraft cross the Atlantic Ocean non-stop earlier that year.Jackson 1988, p.311.Robertson 1970, p.231.Robertson 1970, p.142. Like the Wallaby, the Antelope was a single-engined tractor biplane, but with a modified fuselage to accommodate the pilot and two passengers. The pilot sat in an open cockpit under the tailing edge of the wing, in front of an enclosed cabin where the two passengers sat on wicker seats facing each other, with a door on the left side of the cabin to give direct access and windows to provide the passengers with a view. The cabin was fitted with a hatch on its roof, which when slid forward allowed the rearmost passenger seat to be raised so the passenger could be seated with his or her head outside the cabin.Flight 22 July 1920, pp. 799‚Äì800.Flight 5 August 1920, p.857.Flight 8 July 1920, p.725. It was powered by a single 180 hp (134 kW) Wolseley Viper water-cooled V8 engine and had two-bay wings.Robertson 1970, p.193. Operational history The Antelope was displayed at the 1920 Olympia Aero show, and received its Certificate of Airworthiness on 10 August 1920 before being entered into the Air Ministry Small Commercial Aircraft Competition later that month, where it received the second prize of ¬£3,000. While Sopwith went into Voluntary liquidation, the Antelope was sold to the Larkin Sopwith Aviation Company of Australia in 1923, being fitted with a Siddeley Puma engine, where it was used to fly air mail, remaining in existence until 1935.

Married to the head of a cadet branch of the House of Savoy, she is an ancestor of the kings of Sardinia and of the Savoy kings of Italy. Early life Maria Vittoria Francesca di Savoia was the child of Victor Amadeus II of Sardinia and his ma√Ætresse-en-titre, Jeanne Baptiste d'Albert de Luynes. Born in Turin on 9 February 1690 while her father was reigning Duke of Savoy, her parents' affair had begun in early 1689. Daughter of a French duke of distinguished ancestry and wife of a prominent Savoyard nobleman, initially she sought to avoid becoming a mistress of Victor Amadeus, then reigning Duke of Savoy. But ambition prompted her husband's family and even the Duke's wife, Anne Marie d'Orl√©ans, to encourage the liaison. Her mother's popularity made her unpopular at the Savoyard court. Maria Vittoria's father, jealous and obsessed with Jeanne Baptiste, eventually had her shut up from view of the court. Jeanne Baptiste decided to flee Savoy in 1700 and sought refuge in France from Louis XIV. When her mother fled Savoy in 1700, Maria Vittoria and her brother, Vittorio Francesco di Savoia, remained in the duchy under the care of their father. Her father legitimated Maria Vittoria and her brother Vittorio Francesco, making him the Marchese di Susa (he died childless in 1762, aged 68) and granting her the feminine version of that title, Marchesa di Susa.  Marriage  In 1713 Victor Emmanuel acquired royal dignity, becoming King of Sicily (although he would be compelled to exchange that realm for Sardinia by the European Powers in 1720, while retaining the title of king). Betrothed in mid-1714 in an arrangement which imitated Louis XIV's practice of marrying his legitimated offspring to his royal kinsmen, the princes du sang, Maria Vittoria married Victor Amadeus of Savoy, Prince of Carignan at the Castle of Moncalieri on 7 November, aged 23. Her father gave her husband an annual income of 400,000 livres, partly to assuage injury to the princely dignity of the Carignans for acquiescing to a marital alliance with a lady born out of wedlock. Her father was fond of Prince Victor Amadeus but in 1717, her husband was found to be deeply in debt and lost the King's favour. As a result, Maria Vittoria's husband fled to France in July 1718 during the Regency of Philippe II, Duke of Orl√©ans, travelling as the Conte di Bosco. Soon after, Maria Vittoria followed. France The couple settled in Paris at the court of the infant Louis XV, who lived at the Tuileries Palace. Her husband was created Intendant des M√©nus Plaisirs ‚Äì a sort of Master of Ceremonies by the Regent. The couple lived at the H√¥tel de Soissons, which they claimed in right of the Savoy-Soissons inheritance which had been confiscated when Savoy became an enemy of France under Louis XIV during the War of the Spanish Succession. Maria Vittoria and her husband led a scandalous life at the H√¥tel de Soissons, turning it into one of the most dangerous for gambling in the capital. Maria Vittoria eventually developed a close relationship with Cardinal Fleury, \\"She pretends to be devout and makes money out of the transactions of the court through the Cardinal, with whom she is on good terms.\\" She also became an intimate of Louis Henri, Duke of Bourbon, Louis XV's prime minister after the death of Phillipe d'Orl√©ans. Her husband's position and their connections at the French court were important to their circumstances, as Prince Victor Amadeus proceeded to incur massive debts in France, adding to those already contracted in Savoy. Maria Vittoria is alleged to have intrigued with the Duke of Bourbon, reporting all to her father back in Savoy, effectively acting as a spy.Clarissa Campbell Orr: Queenship in Europe 1660-1815: The Role of the Consort. Cambridge University Press (2004) She also reported attempts of Queen Marie Leszczy≈Ñska to influence Louis XV politically ‚Äì which involved the Duke of Bourbon's trying to dispose of Fleury, a move which ended very badly for the duke.Clarissa Campbell Orr: Queenship in Europe 1660-1815: The Role of the Consort. Cambridge University Press (2004) However, Maria Vittoria is alleged to have remained loyal to Fleury: When the Duke of Bourbon suggested, via an intermediary, that if she could mend the relationship between himself and the Cardinal her husband's huge debts in both France and Savoy would be settled and an income of half a million livres would be assured her, she is said to have indignantly refused. The Queen is said to have sought Maria Vittoria's advice as to how to reconcile with the King when he took offence at her attempts to interfere in his relations with Fleury. She advised the queen to henceforth discontinue all involvement in politics and act only as a role model for the consort of the Most Christian King of France, and advise queen Marie followed.Clarissa Campbell Orr: Queenship in Europe 1660-1815: The Role of the Consort. Cambridge University Press (2004) Nonetheless, Maria Vittoria never became very intimate with the Queen; in 1726 she and Fleury speculated about who would replace Marie if she should die in childbirth.Clarissa Campbell Orr: Queenship in Europe 1660-1815: The Role of the Consort. Cambridge University Press (2004) Maria Vittoria saw her son marry Landgravine Christine of Hesse-Rotenburg, whose sister Caroline of Hesse had married the disgraced Duke of Bourbon in 1728, in 1740.  Later life  Her husband died at the H√¥tel de Soissons in April 1740 heavily in debt; she lived quietly as a widow but successfully managed to marry her only surviving daughter, Princess Anna Teresa of Savoy-Carignan, to the widowed Charles de Rohan, Prince of Soubise. Anna Teresa had one child; Victoire de Rohan, who would become the official governess of Louis XVI's daughter, Marie Th√©r√®se of France. In 1763 Leopold Mozart wrote in a letter that \\"today my little girl was given a small, transparent snuff-box, inlaid with gold, from the Princess Carignan, and Wolfgang a pocket writing case in silver, with silver pens with which to write his compositions; it is so small and exquisitely worked that it is impossible to describe it\\". Maria Vittoria of Savoy-Carignan died in Paris on 8 July 1766 aged 76. She was the paternal grandmother of the Princesse de Lamballe, tragic friend of Marie Antoinette.

The group, widely referred to as a cult, was the subject of a substantial coverage in the media after several judicial cases involving the founder. History Born in 1982, founder Juliano Verbard calls himself \\"Little Lily of Love\\" (\\"Petit Lys d'Amour\\"). He claims that the Virgin Mary speaks to him every day of the 8th day of each month at 22 in a coconut tree. Followers must pay 20 euro to attend to collective prayers. On 9 July 2007, he kidnapped Alexander, a 12-year child, in Sainte-Suzanne, R√©union, in whom he saw his successor and who was released on 5 August 2007. In February 2008, he was accused of child abuse and fraud and was sentenced to fifteen-year imprisonment for raping two children who were respectively 8 and 13. In April 2009, he managed to escape from prison by helicopter with two of his followers, Alexis Michel and his son Jean-Fabrice. He was recaptured in May of the same year, and eventually sentenced to an additional 13 years for the escape. This movement was not recognized by the Catholic hierarchy. It was inspired by an Australian religious group named the Order of Saint Charbel, created by German William Kamm, known as \\"Little Pebble\\" (\\"Petit Caillou\\"). It was also inspired by a French community named Amour et Mis√©ricorde, located in the Jura department in which Verbard lived in 2003. The religious group is criticized by French anti-cult associations, including CCMM and ADFI which considered it as a cult.

The first example of this structure was discovered in 1977 with , providing a chemical formula of Li14Zn(GeO4)4. The crystal structure of LISICON consists of a network of [Li11Zn(GeO4)4]3- as well as 3 loosely bonded Li+. The weaker bonds allow for the lithium ions to easily move from site to site, not needing to break strong bonds to do so. Also, this structure forms large ‚Äúbottlenecks‚Äù between the interstitial positions which these ions occupy, additionally lowering the energy required to move from site to sit. These two factors allow for the lithium ions to diffuse quickly and easily through the structure. However, because of the shape of the channels through which these Lithium ions can diffuse, they are limited to 2 dimensional diffusion.. LISICON compounds have relatively high ionic conductivity, on the order of 10‚àí6 S/cm at 25 ¬∞C. LISICONs readily react with lithium metal and atmospheric gases such as CO2; as a result, their conductivity decreases with time.  LISICON-Like Materials  There are other LISICON type solid electrolytes which make use of other elements to achieve higher ionic conductivities. One such material has the chemical formula of Li(3+x)GexV(1-x)O4, where the value of x is between 0 and 1. There are two compositions, Li3.5Ge0.5V0.5O4 and Li3.6Ge0.6V0.4O4, which had ionic conductivities of 4*10‚àí5 S/cm and 10‚àí5 S/cm, an order of magnitude of improvement upon the base LISICON structure. These materials show good thermal stability and are stable in contact with CO2 and ambient atmosphere, dealing with some problems extant with the original structure. There are materials with the chemical structure of Li(4-x)Si(1-x)PxO4. This is a solid solution between Li4SiO4 and Li3PO4. This solid solution can be formed over the whole composition range at room temperature. The highest ionic conductivity are achieved at compositions of Li3.5Si0.5P0.5O4 and Li3.4Si0.4P0.6, with conductivity on the order of 10‚àí6 S/cm. This results from the substitution of some Si4+ for P5+ in the lattice, resulting in the addition of interstitial Li-ions which diffuse much more easily. The ionic conductivity is further improved with the doping of Cl‚àí to replace O2- in the lattice. The compositions Li10.42Si1.5P1.5Cl11.92 and Li10.42Ge1.5P1.5Cl11.92 achieved ionic conductivities of 1.03 * 10‚àí5 S/cm and 3.7*10‚àí5 S/cm respectively. This Is theorized to be the due to the widening of the ‚Äúbottlenecks‚Äù between interstitial points due to the Cl‚àí ions smaller size, and the weakening of the ionic bonding Li+ ions experienced due to chlorine's lower electronegativity. The conductivities are almost 100 times higher in thio-LISICONs, where oxygen is replaced by sulfur, i.e. the corresponding thiosilicates. The bonding between S2- and Li+ is weaker than that between O2- and Li+, allowing for the Li+ in the sulfide structure to be far more normal than its oxide counterparts. Ceramic thio-LISCON materials based on the chemical formula Li(4-x)Ge(1-x)PxS4 are promising electrolyte materials, with ionic conductivities on the order of 10‚àí3 S/m or 10‚àí2 S/m.  Applications  LISICONs can be used as the solid electrolyte in of lithium based Solid-State Batteries, such as solid state nickel‚Äìlithium battery. For this application, solid lithium electrolytes require ionic conductivities greater than 10‚àí4 S/cm, negligible electronic conductivity, and a wide range of electrochemcial stability.

Medusahead: Economic Impact and Control in Nevada. University of Nevada-Reno Fact Sheet FS-02-37. It was first observed in the United States in Oregon in 1903 by Thomas Howell. Forty-eight percent of the total land area of the United States is rangeland, pastureland, national parks, nature preserves, and other wildlands. These lands are essential for agriculture and for protecting the integrity of ecological systems. Natural areas contain many nonnative plant species that occur as self-sustaining populations in the lower 48 of the United States, including medusahead. As of 2005, medusahead infested approximately in the 17 western states (from North Dakota south to Texas and west to the Pacific coast), and spreads at an average rate of 12% per year.Duncan, C.A., et al. (2004). Assessing the economic, environmental, and societal losses from invasive plants on rangeland and wildlands. Weed Technology 18:1411‚Äì1416 As medusahead spreads, it can outcompete native vegetation in overgrazed rangelands, reduces land value, and creates a wildfire hazard.Dremann, Craig C. Field Notebook No. 260, page 20, Soil samples from the U.C. Sierra Foothill Research & Extension Center, Browns Valley, CA. June 2016 History and origin Medusahead was first described Elymus caput-medusae by Carl Linnaeus. Nevski recommended in 1934 that the Russian types of medusahead should be classified in a separate genus, Taeniatherum. In the 1960s, it was suggested by Jack Major of the University of California that there are three geographic and morphologically distinct taxa: T. caput-medusae, T. asperum, and T. crinitum. After traveling in Russia, Major thought the proper classification for the plant introduced to North America was Taeniatherum asperum. The genus was revised in 1986 by the Danish scientist Signe Frederiksen. He made the previously mentioned distinct taxa into subspecies of Taeniatherum caput-medusae.Kostivkovsky, V. and J. A. Young. (2000). Invasive exotic rangeland weeds: A glimpse at some of their native habitats. Rangelands 22:6 3‚Äì6. The subspecies caput-medusae is a native species to Europe, and is mostly restricted to Spain, Portugal, southern France, Algeria, and Morocco. Subspecies crinitum is found from Greece and the Balkans east into Asia, and the range of subspecies asperum completely overlaps the other two subspecies. In Asia, medusahead is widespread in Turkmenistan, Iran, Syria, and in the northern portion of Israel, inhabiting low mountains and plateau areas. It is both an agronomic and rangeland weed. It prefers soils rich in nitrogen, and is often found on stony or gravelly soils. Carbonized seeds of this weed have been found in early agricultural archaeological sites in Iran. Seeds were first found in strata corresponding to the early days of sheep and goat husbandry. Life cycle and growing habits Medusahead is a winter annual, germinating in the fall and undergoing root growth in the winter and early spring. Since its roots develop early and reach deep in the soil, it outcompetes native plants for moisture. It flowers in early spring, and by June or July its seeds, which are covered with tiny barbs, are mature. The barbs help the seeds attach to livestock, humans or vehicles that pass by. As the grass grows it accumulates silica, making it unpalatable to livestock except for early in its life cycle. It creates a dense layer of litter, and because of the silica content, the litter decomposes more slowly than that of other plants. This litter suppresses native plant growth while encouraging the germination of its own seed, and after a few years it creates an enormous load of dry fuel that can lead to wildfires. Stands of medusahead vary in density from several hundred to 2,000 plants per square foot. This variance is directly related to annual precipitation, soil type, and other vegetation in the area. Research has suggested that medusahead is highly adaptable and can produce more seeds at a density of one plant per square foot than 1,000 plants per square foot. Since it matures later than most other annuals, it is easy to identify as it is often bright green when the other annuals are brown. As it matures, it turns shades of purple and eventually tan. This unique phenological signature can be utilized in the management of this invasive species. A recently developed method of assessing greenness in aerial color infra-red (CIR) imagery using Normalized Difference Vegetation Index (NDVI) values to differentiate between medusahead and other more desirable species may help land managers determine where control methods are necessary. Malmstrom, C.M., H.S. Butterfield, L. Planck, C.W. Long, and V.T. Eviner. (2017). Novel fine-scale aerial mapping approach quantifies grassland weed cover dynamics and response to management. PLOS ONE 12(10): e0181665. Medusahead seeds disperse relatively short distances and dispersal decreases as distance from the plant increases. Seeds are very well adapted for dispersal by adhesion to moving objects. The relatively long period of medusahead seed dispersal from July to October may be an adaptation to increase the likelihood of adhesion to animals.Davies, K. W. (2008). Medusahead dispersal and establishment in sagebrush steppe plant communities. Rangeland Ecology and Management 61: 110‚Äì115. Identification Medusahead ranges in height from 20 to 60 centimeters.Jepson Manual Treatment It has slender, weak stems that often branch at the base. It has spike inflorescences similar to those of wheat or rye. The lemmas have long awns and the glumes have shorter ones, giving the seed head a layered look.Stubbendieck, J.L., et al. (2004). North American Wildland Plants: A Field Guide. University of Nebraska Press. As the awns dry, they twist and spread in all directions, similar to the snake-covered head of the mythological Medusa. The barbs on the awns help the seed drive into the soil.US Forest Service Fire Ecology The grainlike seed may remain viable in the soil for a number of years. Effects on wildlife and grazing The grazing capacity of land infested with medusahead can be reduced by up to 80%.Davies, K.W. and D. D. Johnson. (2008). Managing medusahead in the intermountain west is at a critical threshold. Rangelands. 30:13‚Äì15 Wildlife habitat and biodiversity also suffer, and the weed can eventually lead to alterations in ecosystem functions. The impact medusahead can have on species relying on sagebrush is rarely mentioned. It can exacerbate the decline of sage-grouse (genus Centrocercus) as it replaces plant communities that provide critical habitat for the bird. Other species, such as mule deer and chukar partridges, tend to avoid areas overrun with medusahead because it is not a good food source. In the case of mule deer, a study in Oregon found that even though extensive stands of medusahead were available, those areas (when compared to other plant communities) were least preferred by feeding mule deer in winter, summer, and fall; and they ranked low in the spring. This decrease in feeding was related back to the dominance of medusahead, which deer do not eat, and the subsequent lack of forbs.Bodurtha, T.S., et al. (1989). Mule deer habitat use related to succession in a bunchgrass community. Journal of Wildlife Management 53:2 314‚Äì319. Chukar partridges will ingest medusahead seeds ( caryopses ) if given no other choice. However, if they are given free access to all the medusahead seeds they will eat, they suffered from a significant loss in body weight. Largely undamaged seeds were found in their droppings, suggesting that the digestibility of medusahead by the birds was low.Savage, D.E., et al. (1969). Utilization of medusahead and downy brome caryopses by Chukar Partridges. The Journal of Wildlife Management 33:4 975‚Äì978. Control methods No single control method will eradicate medusahead. For best results, it is often necessary use a form of integrated pest management that combines two or more of the following methods. Mechanical Plowing and disking are two methods of mechanical control. Both methods can effectively control medusahead and can reduce infestation by 65% to 95% the next growing season. Eradication of medusahead by mechanical control by itself is nearly impossible, but when followed by chemical control or revegetation chances for eradication increase dramatically. Burning Fire is often considered a low cost method of improving rangeland condition. It has been given attention in the control of medusahead because many of the areas infested with it are too rocky or steep for other treatments. Control of medusahead with fire had differing results in California. In some areas, more desirable plant communities came back after a fire, while in other areas medusahead continued to dominate after fire. There are a few guidelines that should be followed when burning medusahead. The burn should be conducted when the seed is in the soft dough stage (when the seeds exude a milky substance when squeezed) in the late spring. The initial fire should be one that is slow burning, something that is easily achieved by burning into the wind. This prevents the fire from advancing too rapidly and ensures that the current year's herbage is burned and periods of maximum temperature are long enough to kill medusahead caryopses. Viable medusahead caryopses are found almost entirely in the litter and on the soil surface.Young, J.A., et al. (1972). Influence of repeated annual burning on a medusahead community. Journal of Range Management 25:5 372‚Äì375. Past studies on the effectiveness of burning may have given researchers false hope. The caryopses have severe temperature dependent afterripening requirements which prevent seeds from germinating at temperatures above 10ÀöC for about 180 days after maturity. If these conditions are met, many medusahead caryopses from the litter and soil in burned plots were viable. Since the seeds did not germinate during the afterripening period, researchers were misled into believing they were accomplishing more by burning than was actually the case. Chemical Chemical control can be effective if used in conjunction with other control methods. Glyphosate (Roundup) applied at 0.375 lbs/acre in the early spring before seeds are produced can provide good results. This timing will also limit the damage to nontarget species that develop later in the growing season. Research suggests that burning before chemical application is more effective than chemicals alone. In the late 1960s, a study was conducted that determined the effectiveness of paraquat on medusahead control in different areas of the United States. This study found that paraquat was effective in controlling medusahead in California, but did not suppress the grass in Reno, Nevada. This was significant because it determined that there was no effective herbicide for the simultaneous spraying and reseeding of medusahead infestations.Young, J.A., et al. (1971). Response of medusahead to paraquat. Journal of Range Management 24:1 41‚Äì43. Biological Medusahead was found to be susceptible to certain root rot fungi including crown rot and take-all, but it was not susceptible to barepatch, browning root rot, and common root rot. The diseases did not reduce the overall weight of the roots, but take-all significantly reduced the overall dry weight of the aboveground shoots. Soil-borne pathogens can have a severe effect on grasses as long as the environmental conditions for the diseases are optimized. Take-all is associated with plants growing in high soil moisture, and like crown rot, it affected medusahead. In contrast, crown rot had the greatest impact on water-stressed plants and therefore may be an effective biological control of grassy weeds in the arid regions of the western U.S. It is also promising because it did not have a significant negative impact on desirable grasses such as western wheatgrass.Grey, W.E., et al. (1995). Potential for biological control of downy brome (Bromus tectorum) and medusahead (Taeniatherum caput-medusae) with crown and root rot fungi. Weed Technology 9:2 362‚Äì365. Grazing Grazing alone is not a good method of medusahead control. For best results, grazing is used as part of an integrated program. It is an efficient management tool as long as the timing and duration of grazing are controlled properly. For example, if grazing is carried out in conjunction with revegetation, the desirable grasses must be established before the grazing can take place, otherwise the revegetation will be futile. In areas where desirable grasses have completed their life cycle by the winter or early spring, grazing during this time can help reduce medusahead. It should still be in a vegetative stage and therefore more palatable to livestock. Grazing in the late spring, summer, and fall is not recommended because it will give medusahead a competitive advantage as cattle graze species other than medusahead. If livestock grazing is a method used to control mature stands of medusahead, the livestock must be moved to a holding area for 10 days to two weeks and fed weed-free feed before they are moved to weed-free areas. This will prevent the seeds that pass through the animals from germinating in areas that are free of medusahead. Restoration Revegetation should be a part of any medusahead management plan. If medusahead is not first controlled, reseeding an infested area will not be successful. The existing medusahead has to be controlled and especially not allowed to produce more seed, and the seed bank in the soil also has to be reduced. This usually takes two or three years, depending on soil moisture and growing conditions. After this, seedling of desirable species can become established. Combining a tillage treatment followed by herbicide is most effective in controlling the weed and promoting desirable plant growth. Squirreltail, bluebunch wheatgrass, crested wheatgrass, intermediate wheatgrass, Thurber's needlegrass, needle and thread, Indian ricegrass, sandberg bluegrass, and sheep fescue are all competitive grasses that work well when renovating an area previously infested with medusahead in the western United States. Prevention Since medusahead seeds are often spread by adhering to humans, animals, and vehicles, it is recommended to restrict these kinds of traffic in infestations to prevent the spread of medusahead. Narrow containment zones of around 3 meters would successfully suppress the invasion of medusahead to surrounding areas. Plant communities that have high densities of large perennial bunchgrasses are more resistant to medusahead invasion, so managing rangelands to promote and maintain large perennial bunchgrasses is critical to prevent the spread of medusahead. This will reduce the establishment of new infestations, but successful management will also require searching for and eradicating new infestations. Controlling new infestations is more effective, and often more feasible, than trying to control large infestations. Even if attempts to prevent and control new infestations are not entirely successful, these efforts will slow the rate of spread and give researchers and land managers more time to develop better prevention, restoration, and control methods. Also, slowing the rate of invasion helps promote rangeland health and productivity in areas that are most at risk of invasion. Without an active prevention program, this weed will continue to spread and increase its negative ecological and economical impacts. Managing medusahead may seem expensive per acre, but when all the acres that are protected by managing an infestation are considered, the price is very reasonable. And, when taking into account the rising land prices, the cost of medusahead management to the individual livestock producer is rapidly becoming more reasonable compared to purchasing additional acreage to offset production losses from medusahead invasion.

Royal Botanic Gardens, Edinburgh Tiger grass, Nepalese broom grass, broom grass, broom stick are common names for this plant, in Nepali amliso () and jharu in Assamese . The flowers of this plant are used as cleaning tool or broom, which is known as ‡§ï‡•Å‡§ö‡•ç‡§ö‡•ã in Nepali, ‡§ù‡§æ‡§°‡§º‡•Ç jhadu (phool jhadu) in Hindi. Habitat It is found growing along steep hills, sandy banks of rivers and damp steep banks along ravines. It is widely distributed throughout Nepal but only up to an altitude of 2000 metres. The grass can be grown on severely degraded and marginal lands. Broom grass tends to grow in tussocks, with 4-5 tussocks in a 100-metre radius and is harvested during the winter seasons between January and March. Horticultural use Tiger grass is another common name for this plant throughout the tropics where it is grown as an ornamental. It may be used to create the effect of bamboo, which it resembles, but to which it is not related. Growing techniques In order to grow broom grass the slips in the planting site must be clear of weeds and debris. Planting the broom grass slips in fertile soil ensures the best yield. It is usually planted at the beginning of monsoon season during the months of May to June as the soil has the best moisture for plant genesis. One month before planting pits of 30m cubed are dug up and left for weathering. On hilly land the pits should be placed about 1.5 x 2m apart along the contour lines or trace bunds, while on fertile land the best spacing is 2.5m x 2.5m. Farm yard manure and 10% BHC fertilizer at 10 grams per pit are mixed into the pits before planting the seeds. The plant becomes rather low maintenance after planting. The plant requires to be weeded 3-4 times in the first year and annually in the following years. Manure can be applied to the soil during the second weeding to provide the best yields in the first year. The pits need to be fenced off to protect the plants from grazing. Harvesting Shan lady in Thoet Thai, northern Thailand, prepares the dried flowers of the broom grass for making brooms The mature panicles which turn light green or red are harvested in the winter season from January to March. The timing of the harvest is essential as if the plant is harvested prematurely (5‚Äì7 days) their production declines, while if it harvested late it will begin to wilt. The panicles are either harvested by cutting above the soil separating the panicle for stem or pulling the panicles out by hand. It is important to make sure the young sprouts are not damaged or the plants uprooted during harvest. The yield will be the lowest in the first and fifth year with the highest in the third. Benefits for Nepal Broom grass is a significant source of income for subsistence communities, primarily for the women who collect it to manufacture and sell them as brooms across Nepal. In addition to providing cash income when sold as brooms the plant provides a variety of uses to the farmers such as, the leaves provide green forage for livestock, the roots promote soil conservation, and the dried up stems can be used as stakes to support growing vegetables. Broom grass has had a direct impact in preventing frequent landslides, helping retain ground moisture and fertility, and improving soil quality by reducing soil erosion. Broom grass has the ability to crowd out invasive species when intercropped and is beneficial in retaining soil nutrients to regrow vegetation. The grass also possesses numerous medicinal properties that are essential in subsistence communities. Environmental sustainability The planting of Nepalese broom grass has a direct impact on preventing surface soil erosion on steep hillsides. Broom grass grows in clumps and has many tangled up roots that grow to about one metre below the ground. This makes it highly effective in preventing soil erosion on hillsides as the grass is less likely to fall compared to other plants and trees that would have been planted there. The roots and leaves of the plant slow down water drops and the flow of water after heavy rain by absorbing the water in the soil. Growing broom grass on degraded land has been proven to help rehabilitate it as it helps retain ground moisture and promote fertility. There is no irrigation required to grow the grass and it does not produce any wastewater. No external inputs or energy is needed to grow the plant as it only requires human labour, which can be extensive in the first year of growing. Broom grass farming is highly recommended in new shifting cultivation systems on marginal lands to repair the damage from previous slash and burn methods. Impact on promoting local biodiversity The start of Nepalese farmers growing broom grass has increased the local biodiversity in the communities. Now that the farmers have to tie up their livestock since they feed on the broom grass, other plant species in the area can successfully regrow and multiply. Broom grass that have been planted in areas where slash and burn cultivation took place has caused tree stumps to grow branches and other vegetation to grow back. Endangered animals such as the Barking Deer and Monkey are now reappearing in the infertile slash and burn areas where they once lived, as the broom grass used to rehabilitate the soil helps promote the growth of other vegetation the animals use for food. Broom grass does not compete for land with cereal crops so they can be grown simultaneously. Gender impacts The farming of broom grass has had a sincere impact on the women in the communities. It has helped women become more empowered by raising their financial status and lessening the burden of other tasks. Females in the communities perform 70 percent of the labour required for the cultivation and manufacturing of the brooms. Women‚Äôs efforts to promote broom grass farming has been very important as they have started pressuring males of the family to grow the plant after seeing the income potential it has. Women carry the responsibility of the tedious tasks of collecting firewood for cooking and fodder for animals, which can be eliminated with broom grass as the plants stocks provide firewood and the leaves provide fodder. Even though women have the added task of harvesting broom grass, it is much preferred over searching for firewood and fodder.

Spiralgrass is a common name for plants in this genus. These are bunchgrass species that are found in vernal pools of central California and Baja California, Mexico. The plants are annuals that germinate under water in the spring and grow submerged for weeks. After the pools dry down, the grasses initiate a new set of foliage that lasts for one to two months until flowering and fruiting are complete. Taxonomy The genus was circumscribed by John R. Reeder in 1982. Along with Orcuttia and Neostapfia, Tuctoria is one of three genera in the tribe Orcuttieae, previously outlined by Reeder in 1965. All three Tuctoria species were formerly assigned to Orcuttia, the type genus of Orcuttieae. Reeder erected Tuctoria after determining that the three species were more closely related among themselves than to any of the other Orcuttia species. Shared features include chromosome numbers, the spiral arrangement of spikelets on the rachis, the absence of juvenile leaves, the presence of lodicules, and the presence of an epiblast in the seed embryos. The name Tuctoria is an anagram of Orcuttia. Recent (2010) molecular phylogenetic analysis suggests that Tuctoria is not monophyletic as currently circumscribed, and is in need of taxonomic revision. Description Tuctoria species have their spikelets spirally arranged on the axis; lemmas are entire (with a smooth, even margin) or denticulate (finely toothed), and often have a centrally placed short, sharp tip (mucro). The inflorescence is not cylindrical (as in Neostapfia), and the spikelets are laterally flattened. The lemmas are narrower, the tip is mucronate or otherwise entire or denticulate. The caryopsis is not sticky, and the brown embryo is visible throughout the light-colored pericarp. Species There are three species in Tuctoria. *Tuctoria fragilis (originally described as Orcuttia fragilis by Jason Richard Swallen in 1944). Found in Baja California (Mexico), it has culms up to long, inflorescences often numbering several from the upper nodes, and a caryopsis that is somewhat pear-shaped and wrinkled. *Tuctoria greenei (originally Orcuttia grenei ‚àí Vasey). Found in California, it has culms less than long, with the inflorescence terminal on the flowering culm. The caryopsis is long and oblong, and wrinkled. *Tuctoria mucronata (originally Orcuttia mucronata ‚àí Crampton). Endemic to Solano County south of Dixon, Northern California. Its inflorescence is partially included in the upper lead, and its lemmas taper gradually to a mucronate tip. The caryopsis is smooth, measuring long. Ecology and distribution Vernal pool in Sacramento Valley, central California Tuctoria species are endemic to seasonal pools in the southwestern US. Like all species in tribe Orcuttieae, the growth of Tuctoria species is initiated underwater. When pools dry, the plants undergo a metamorphosis whereby aquatic foliage is replaced with terrestrial foliage. The terrestrial foliage has Kranz anatomy, indicating the use of C-4 photosynthesis. This adaptation help the plants survive the longs periods of drought-like conditions experienced when the pools dry. In years with little rainfall, their seed banks remain dormant until a season of rainfall that is adequate to fill the pool basins. In T. greenei, germination is almost entirely dependent upon a combination of anaerobic conditions and light. This strategy helps the plant begin germination when pool basins are filled with water. In years of low precipitation, the soil subsurface is likely to be anaerobic or hypoxic, and inhibit germination. Tuctoria greenei is of high conservation concern in California, as vernal pool systems are in decline due to agricultural development and urban expansion.

It is about long and up to wide, and flows from north to south through the district of Gifhorn and the city of Wolfsburg.  Course  The Kleine Aller rises in the Brome village of Wiswedel at 78 m above sea level. It drains the Kiebitzmoor west of T√ºlau, through a system of ditches that has been continually expanded over the years, and also drains the Vogelmoor north of Barwedel. In this region it is joined by the tributary of the Rhodische Aller. Finally the Kleine Aller flows southwards, past Bergfeld, Barwedel, Tiddische, Hoitlingen and Jembke. From Jembke it forms the border between the district of Gifhorn and the city of Wolfsburg. The river also passes Wolfsburg-Brackstedt and Wolfsburg-Warmenau to enter the Aller Canal south of Weyhausen at a height of 55.5 m above sea level and at a point a few hundred metres after it branches away from the River Aller itself. The sections near T√ºlau, Bergefeld and Tiddische have been renaturalised and, in places, a new river channel has been dug out. The near-natural areas thus created have been planted with alder. This provides important areas of shade because much of the river is directly illuminated by the sun, something which leads to rapid weed growth and choking of the river bed.  Formation and history  The river channel was formed, like the surrounding landscape, in the penultimate ice age, the Saale glaciation. The ice sheets shaped the terrain over 100,000 years ago with their ground moraines. The streams acted as drainage channels for the higher lying areas of geest in the Aller glacial valley. In the Middle Ages the valley of the Kleine Aller created a natural, north-south oriented border between two regions. These were the Boldecker Land in the west and the historic landscape of the Vorsfelder Werder in the east. The Kleine Aller has been able to carve out a valley during the course of its existence which, in its middle reaches, is about 10 m deep and about 1,000 m wide in which a eutrophic peat fen has become established. In earlier times the valley was only used as grassland due to frequent flooding; today the river meadows are mainly used for arable farming. The old meandering Kleine Aller was straightened and canalised in 1865 along almosts its entire length. The river bed was also raised. The changes to the river and the lack of flooding has enabled the land in the valley depression of the Kleine Aller to be used as farmland.  Water quality  Near Warmenau there has been a water quality station since 1967, where water quality has been regularly tested since 1976. The 2004 Lower Saxon water quality reportKleine Aller Water Quality Report by the NLWKN assesses the chemical water pollution of the Kleine Aller as variable. The values for organic pollution, nitrate, ammonium and phosphate contamination vary from lightly polluted to very heavily polluted. Ammonium levels in particular suffer from wide variations and sometimes high values. This is due to the fact that the waterway receives the discharge from five sewage works and that the nitrogen content in these installations has not been reduced sufficiently.

The museum is part of the Royal Air Force Museum, a non- departmental public body sponsored by the Ministry of Defence and a registered charity. The museum is spread over two sites in England; the other site is at the Royal Air Force Museum London at Colindale (near Hendon) in north London. History The London museum was officially opened at the Colindale (then part of Hendon) London site on 15 November 1972 by Queen Elizabeth II. The hangars housed just 36 aircraft at opening. Over the years, the collection increased and aircraft were stored at RAF stations around the country when they were not on display to the public. On 1 May 1979, the Cosford site was opened at RAF Cosford, one of the RAF stations which had been used to store the museum's collection of aircraft. On opening, the museum initially exhibited airframes which had been used for technical training at RAF Cosford. In the following years additional aircraft were added to the collection, and in 1980 it was agreed that the British Airways Collection be displayed at Cosford. On 21 June 1998 four additional galleries were opened, housing art, temporary exhibitions and other aviation subjects. 13 May 2002 saw the relocation of the RAF Museum Conservation Centre from Cardington, Bedfordshire to Cosford. The Centre, costing ¬£2.4 million, was opened by Marshal of the Royal Air Force Sir Michael Beetham.Ellis 2004, p. 179. The Cosford site includes several developmental aircraft such as those that led to the English Electric Lightning and the second prototype of the BAC TSR-2. A lot of the aircraft are very rare, such as the only Boulton Paul Defiant in the world and one of only two surviving Vickers Wellingtons left in the world. The first Director of the Museum was Dr John Tanner who retired in 1987. In 1988 Dr Michael A Fopp (who had previously directed the London Transport Museum) was appointed and was Director General of all three sites covered by the Museum until his retirement in 2010. The site can be reached by public transport via the neighbouring Cosford railway station on the Wolverhampton to Shrewsbury Line. British Airways collection In 1980, the Cosford site agreed to house the British Airways Museum collection. In 2006 British Airways withdrew funding from the collection, after which the RAF Museum did not take on the costs of maintaining the aircraft. Several of the jet airliners were subsequently broken up, including the only Boeing 707 that was preserved in the UK, a Vickers VC10 and a Hawker Siddeley Trident. National Cold War Exhibition The National Cold War Exhibition The National Cold War Exhibition opened at Cosford in February 2007. The exhibition houses the museum's V bombers and other Cold War aircraft in a newly constructed 8,000m2 exhibition building designed by architects Fielden Clegg Bradley. The exhibition concept and design was developed by Neal Potter and includes 'silo theatres' which depict, in a variety of media, the key tensions of the Cold War period.

PFP primarily works in Central America and has headquarters in Boulder, Colorado.Rarick, Charles A. and Duchatelet, Martine. Potters for Peace: Throwing Clay in Nicaragua for Peace and Profit. 2006. Journal of the International Academy for Case Studies. 12:141-144 PFP manages projects that help local potters to improve and market their products. PFP is best known for their work in water treatment, which has influenced water treatment systems worldwide. The treatment strategy follows a Point-of-Use (POU) water treatment design that uses ceramic water filters to remove pathogens and other contaminants from the water. This is generally a very effective method to remove bacteria from water, though there are some concerns about the ease of use and maintenance of the filtration units. Unlike other similar organizations, PFP does not manufacture these filters, but instead helps local communities to set up independent filter workshops to produce and sell the filters.Potters for Peace, accessed October 28, 2009  Mission  Potters for Peace is clear to assert itself as an assistance organization, rather than an aid-based organization. Instead of simply solving the problem, PFP aims to provide sustainable solutions propelled by the goals of the individuals they work with. According to the Potters for Peace website, \\"Our goals are to offer support, solidarity and friendship to developing world potters; assist with appropriate technologies sustained using local skills and materials; help preserve cultural traditions; and assist in marketing locally, regionally and internationally\\".  History  Potters for Peace got its start in 1986 when a group of potters led by Mary Chapman and Dolly Pomerleau of the Quixote Center in Washington DC traveled to Nicaragua. The potters met with a female pottery/canning cooperative. This led to the first PFP fundraiser in Washington, DC. The program began to gain momentum after the Nicaraguan civil war to help pottery cooperatives.Visiting Potters in Nicaragua, Pillers, B.T., 1998, Ceramics Monthly, 46:16, accessed October 28, 2009 In 1988, the first contact in Nicaragua was made. A year later Steve Earp and Ron Rivera were sent. Ron Rivera helped make tenmoku glazed ceramics for electrical transmission lines. Over the next decade, PFP grew in size, finally receiving 501(c) (3) non-profit status in 1999 in the US. PFP later obtained non- governmental organization status in Nicaragua. The best known PFP project, ceramic water filters, was begun when in 1998 Hurricane Mitch struck Central America. A filter workshop was set up in 1999. This workshop developed into an independent business that has implemented more than 40,000 filters in collaboration with several NGOs. PFP takes pride in the fact that it does not operate any filter workshops, but instead trains local potters to produce and distribute the filters.  Potters Without Borders  Potters Without Borders registered as a Non-Profit society in British Columbia, Canada in 2006 is the sister organization of Potters For Peace and works on projects together with PFP. PWB is based in Enderby, British Columbia, Canada with offices in Clare, Nova Scotia and Ningming, Guangxi, China.Potters Without Borders Canada, Ben Sanami/Morrill, Potters Without Borders, September 2006.  Projects  PFP has been active with several programs in Nicaragua since 1989. These programs emphasize the mission of PFP to help local potters succeed in their own right. Many of these projects center around helping potters market their products locally and abroad (PFP help organized an 18,000 piece sale to Pier 1 from a Nicaraguan cooperative, though this may have had negative long-term results) or use their skills to create new products that solve a local issue.Investigation of the Potters For Peace Colloidal Silver Impregnated Ceramic Filter , Daniele S. Lantagne, December 21, 2001, accessed October 29, 2009  Potters Teaching Potters  The goals of the Potters Teaching Potters project is to share skills and knowledge about pottery. It allows campesina potters to travel in their country and abroad by providing transportation and expenses. Additionally, PFP finances scholarships for apprenticeships and holds conferences that bring together both Nicaraguan potters and also international buyers which help potters learn how to market their products abroad.  Technical and Design Assistance  As part of the Technical and Design Assistance program, Potters for Peace give access to necessary tools along with training on items such as energy-efficient kilns. Pottery designs are constantly being refined to fit the needs of their customers.  Fuel Efficient Kilns  The Fuel Efficient Kiln project was begun when volunteer Manny Hernandez designed a kiln that uses 50% less firewood to fire pottery. These kilns, called \\"Mani\\" kilns, have been built worldwide, totaling at least 60 so far.  Alternative Fuel Burners  Along with helping potters with starting up their practices, PFP helps maintain this profession by utilizing agricultural and construction waste as fuel for firing pottery as part of the Alternative Fuel Burners project. As firewood becomes more and more expensive, PFP keeps sustainability at the forefront of their projects by pushing for alternative and local fuels.  Ceramic Raw Materials Research  Potters for Peace has a materials research facility in Nicaragua where different combinations of ceramics are tested for their different properties for the Ceramic Raw Materials Research project. Also, PFP pays some of its potters to do their own materials research. Marketing  Pieces made by these local potters are marketed in several ways. PFP developed a system of road signs that alert people to the availability of pottery. Funding is given for these potters to attend artisan fairs, where they show their wares and make connections.  Ceramic Water Purifiers  The manufacturing process is quite simple. A press forms the pot shape out of clay mixed with rice husks. The pot is fired, and the husk burns, leaving small holes that the water can run through. Finally the filters are coated with colloidal silver. The filters are used with plastic storage units to collect the water.A Simple Way to Make Bad Water Safe , Jen Banbury, UNICEF USA, October 15, 2008, accessed October 28, 2009. The efficacy of the PFP filter has been assessed by several independent organizations. It is reported to remove up to 99.9% of fecal coliform under laboratory conditions; however, this removal rate can vary greatly under usage in the field Reconsidering appropriate technology: the effects of operating conditions on the bacterial removal performance of two household drinking-water filter systems, Baumgartner, J., Murcott, S., and Ezzati, M. 2007. Environmental Research Letters, accessed October 28, 2009. Efficacy of the CPW filters also depends on the flow rates through the filter. Lower flow rates have led to disuse of the filter. It is found that a filter manufactured with a clay to sawdust volume fraction of 1:1 was found optimal for field use. An elaborate study illustrated that the flow rate through the 1:1 CPW followed a hyperbolic relationship with time.Theoretical and Experimental Investigation of Water Flow through Porous Ceramic Clay Composite Water Filter, A. K. Plappally, I. Yakub, L. C. Brown, W. O. Soboyejo and A. B. O. Soboyejo. FDMP: Fluid Dynamics & Materials Processing, Vol. 5, No. 4, pp. 373-398, 2009, accessed Nov 01, 2010. This study also discussed the relationship between flow rate from the CPW filters and quantity of materials (Clay and Sawdust) used in the manufacture of the filters. The long-term sustainability of CPWs has also been assessed. It has been found that the CPWs have a disuse rate of 2% per month, with 67% of this disuse resulting from filter breakage. This leads to a mean usage lifetime of 2 years.Point of Use Household Drinking Water Filtration: A Practical, Effective Solution for Providing Sustained Access to Safe Drinking Water in the Developing World, Sobsey, M.D., Stauber, C.E., Casanova, L.

Formed in 1997, the group refers to itself as post-Irish. They have established themselves as a point of reference on the Catalan music scene, developing from Irish folk beginnings towards a more personalised stance expressed by what they call the Barcelona Irish Sound. The group seek to demystify Irish Traditional Music and in general all forms of folk music by drawing on a variety of styles injected with a healthy dose of irony. History After the break-up of the Stomping Clawhammers, Dara Luskin (bass), Frank McMahon (banjo, mandolin), Alex Crichton (vocals, guitar) formed Los Stompers in 1997. Following a tour of Scandinavia, the band released its first album, Mezzy on Stage,Mezzy on Stage, 1998 in 1998. Recorded live in the now defunct Jazzmatazz, Barcelona and released through former Los Manolos:es:Los Manolos group members label, Ventilador Music,Ventilador Music the album was a compendium of traditional Irish pub songs such as \\"Follow me up to Carlow\\", \\"The Star of the County Down\\" and \\"Waxie's Dargle\\" as well as original material. 1999 saw the release of their debut studio album, Pub Friction,Pub Friction, 1999 joined by Colm Petit on fiddle, and solidified their proposal of a fusion between many styles and traditions from Catalan rumba to country music. This was achieved through the production skills of former Manolos drummer Andreu Hernandez, various collaborations with experienced session musicians such as Ricky Araiza and Cece Giannotti, and the inclusion of many instruments not normally found in Irish music such as the caj√≥n, the darbouka, trumpet and tuba. The album was received well in the Spanish press, with reviews by EFE EMEJordi Turt√≥s, EFE EME and La Vanguardia. With the inclusion of David Garc√≠a on drums and the replacement of Colm Petit initially by Dave Holmes and later by Juan Aguiar, 2001 saw the release of Belmondo Caf√©.Belmondo Cafe, 2001 A more stylised and produced album but laced yet again with a dash of wry humour and fusion of genres including ska, ragga and pop. The album was reviewed by Spanish newspapers Avui and El Pais.The group followed this up with a tour of CatalunyaLa Vanguardia, 14 November 2001 and a new-look line-up. Dani Violant joined on diatonic accordion and Salva Suau and Dave Holmes replaced David Garcia and Juan Aguiar respectively. The band's single \\"Turn of the century EU\\" was on the playlist of the Spanish radio station M80 Radio during May 2001. In 2003 Dave Varriale replaced Salva Suau on drums. Varriale had recently finished a Tour with Paul Fuster. The year 2005 saw more personnel changes, with Violant and Varriale both leaving and Marcos L√≥pez joining on drums.

It has headquarters in Tel Aviv and in Buenos Aires. History Dori Media was founded in 1996 by Yair Dori, who in the early 1990s started importing Argentine soaps to the Israeli market, which became a huge success. And led to the creation of cable channels, which dedicate themselves to air Latin soaps.TV's Betty Goes Global: From Telenovela to International Brand Edited by: Janet McCabe, Kim Akass, page 168 After the soap opera Chiquititas became a huge phenomenon in Israel, Dori approached producer Cris Morena about developing a new project. At the time, she was seeking desperately for a financier to her new project, Rebelde Way. He accepted to invest in the project which ended up being a huge success in Argentina and a never before seen phenomenon in Israel. Afterwards, it was sold to over 50 countries and was remade by Mexico (Rebelde) and India (Remix), among others. He also financed another Cris Morena project Rincon de Luz which was not so successful in Argentina but was still extremely popular in Israel. Relationship between Morena and Dori started to turn sour when she did not accept to produce a third season of Rebelde Way and instead decided to produce Floricienta. Instead of counting with Dori to take care of the financial part of the project, Morena decided to work with RGB Entertainment instead which delimited Dori role to only deal with sales to East Europe. While Floricienta was a bigger phenomenon in Latin America and Argentina than Rebelde Way, it could not exceed the success of the predecessor in Israel and Dori and Morena parted ways. He then started to co-produce with another Argentine companies. With Pol-ka, Dori Media produced Hombres de Honor, Padre Coraje, Sos Mi Vida and Dr. Amor. And with CENTRAL PARK PRODUCTIONS, the highly successful Lalola. In 2007, Dori did their first independent production: El Refugio. With part of the Rebelde Way cast and staff (but without its creator Cris Morena), Dori tried to recreate the momentum of the show. It didn't work and the show was a huge flop. After achieved huge international success with Lalola, production done by Central Park Productions. Its current productions are Champs 12 and Cupido - El Negocio del Amor. The first one, a teen soap, is currently being aired in Argentina and other Latin American countries with lukewarm reception. The second one, which will mark the return of Ana Maria Orozco to television, is currently in production.

It was based on the 1966 novel of the same name by Audrey Erskine Lindop. The film was moderately controversial because of Agutter's squeaky-clean image and youth (16, playing a 14-year-old), when coupled with the film's sexual content.Britmovie.co.uk It also included Simon Ward's first major film role. The theme song, also titled \\"I Start Counting\\", was sung by Lindsey Moore. The film was shot at Bray Studios in Berkshire and on location around Bracknell. The sets were designed by the art director Brian Eatwell.  Plot summary  Wynne (Agutter), an adopted 14-year-old girl, has a crush on her 32-year-old stepbrother, George (Bryan Marshall). While spying on George in the bathroom, Wynne notices he has several scratches on his back, and finds a jumper she made for him that he threw in the rubbish has blood on it; this leads her to suspect him of being the serial killer of several local teenage girls, who is still at large. Despite this belief, Wynne continues to have romantic sexual fantasies about George, and dreams of marrying him when she comes of legal age. Wynne hides in George's minibus, thinking to catch him in the act of murdering a young girl, but instead discovers he is having an affair with a mentally fragile woman (Lana Morris), whose blood was on the discarded jumper after she slashed her wrist in a suicide attempt. Wynne's best friend Corinne (Clare Sutcliffe) teases her about her crush on George and, when the family goes out on a picnic, Corinne even flirts with him; he gets angry at her for acting like a \\"pathetic little mini-tart\\", and pins her down roughly on the ground. Corinne runs off, and later telephones Wynne to tell her she will stay out all night with an unnamed boy who, she says, they both know. Wynne gets worried about her friend, goes searching for her, and finds Corrinne's dead body. When the murderer sees Wynne, he chases and corners her. He seems to break down in distress, as he genuinely likes her, at which point the police arrive.

Because of Gruau's inherent skills and creativity, he contributed to a change in the entire fashion industry through the new pictures that represented the already popular designs created by designers in the industry. The benefits, including economic stimulation and enhancement of advertising are still present in the industry today via a new way of fashion illustration, fashion photography. Gruau became one of the best known and favorite artists of the haute couture world during the 1940s and 50s working with Femina, Marie Claire, L'Officiel, L'Album Du Figaro and an assortment of \\"high-style\\" magazines. Gruau's artwork is recognized and commended internationally in some of Paris and Italy's most prestigious art museums including the Louvre in Paris and the Blank in Italy. In addition to his international fame and recognition, \\"Gruau's artwork is known for its timeless and enduring style\\".  Personal life  Born Renato Zavagli Ricciardelli delle Caminate in Rimini, Italy, on 4 February 1909, Gruau was the son of an Italian count but instead of following in his father's footsteps and accepting the job of royal military commander his passion and inclination for arts led him to a love and pursuance of fine arts. When Ren√©'s mother, Maria Gruau, a French aristocrat, and his father separated when he was three, he moved to Paris with her. Gruau then took his mother's last name, which is the name he is known by, opposed to his father's last name and noble connection. At fourteen, Gruau began to support his mother and himself by selling drawings to the Milanese fashion journal Lidel. He demonstrated talent for drawing throughout much of his early life and worked as an illustrator for fashion magazines such as Femina, Marie Claire, and Vogue in Paris in his teens and early 20s. Gruau found it difficult to find work during World War II and ultimately found little work for small or unestablished designers such as Christian Dior before he became popular during this time. He worked as he could and contributed to the concealment of Jewish refugees.  Career  Gruau's signature Gruau's artistic talent in fashion illustration merited him publication at the age of 14 and by the time he reached 18, he was published internationally, in the US, Italy, and France. In his lifetime, Gruau worked for numerous magazines including Marie-Claire, Femina, Elle, Vogue, Harper's Bazaar, Flair, L'Officiel, Madame Figaro, and L'Officiel de la Couture. Gruau was hired by major designers like Pierre Balmain, Christian Dior, Jacques Fath, Balenciaga, Elsa Schiaparelli, Rochas, Lanvin, Elizabeth Arden, and Hubert de Givenchy. Gruau gave life to their haute couture clothing and expanded their popularity with his captivating illustrations. Gruau's illustrations reinvented many of the designs and gave them lambency and radiance that the fashion industry previously lacked. Gruau, whose posters often echoed both classical Japanese drawings and Toulouse-Lautrec's sketches of fin de si√®cle Paris night life, was perhaps best known for creating the marketing images for Miss Dior perfume and for Rouge Baiser lipstick. According to Alan Riding of the New York Times, \\"everything he did, he evoked the glamour and style of the world of high fashion\\". Because the technical age of the 20th century had yet to emerge, Gruau's pictures were the advertisements of the time and gave marketing and presentation of clothing a new brilliant flair. Gruau's first position as artistic director for advertising was in 1947 with Christian Dior. The two together formed the \\"New Look\\" of the time, partially a result of Dior's designs, and partially a result of Gruau's combined interpretation and upgrading of old-style graphic illustration. Gruau formed a friendship with Dior that contributed to their successful collaboration and further enlargement of fashion advertisement, which a primary reason he is mostly remembered for his work with Dior. Gruau moved to the United States in 1948 to work for Vogue and Harper's Bazaar. He remained with the magazine for two years, and then went to work as sole illustrator for Flair. There were exhibitions of Gruau's work at the Paris Mus√©e du Costume in 1989 and Mus√©e de la Publicit√© in 1999. Rimini, Italy's Riviera, has a permanent collection in its city museum. Today Gruau's works are in the permanent collections of many art institutions, including the Louvre in Paris.  Impact on fashion  During Gruau's lifelong career he collaborated with fashion houses such as Givenchy, Balenciaga, Lanvin, Schiaparelli, and Dior in the fashion area of haute couture. His advertising campaigns for Moulin Rouge and Lido de Paris utilised an old-world aesthetic, celebrating the traditional poster-art graphics of Toulouse-Lautrec, Bonnard and the pre-1900 Parisian artists. He continued to work in advertising designing the hugely influential cinema poster for Fellini's La Dolce Vita in 1959 and working on campaigns for names such as Dior, Air France, Martini, and Omega watches. He has been exhibited internationally at the Paris Musee du Costume and The Musee de la Publicite. The 2011 Spring/Summer Haute Couture Collection of Christian Dior by John Galliano was heavily inspired by Gruau's works.

Start of the fight  At his hacienda La Sauceda, he organized the farmers to fight against the Spanish. His headquarters was Fuerte del Sombrero (Del Sombrero fort), where Javier Mina joined Pedro Moreno's forces. In this fort they fought until August 15 of 1817 when they had to evacuate the fort because of a Spanish attack. Once out of the fort, the locations of all their battles were: El Baj√≠o and Los Altos de Jalisco. Pedro Moreno and Francisco Javier Mina went back to the Fuerte del Sombrero. Final days The Spanish again attacked the fort but this time continuously for two months. Without food, provisions, and any hope of help, the revolutionaries had to get out of the fort. On October 27, while traveling on their escape, they had to stop at the ranch El Venadito, where they were attacked. In this attack Pedro Moreno was killed.

The locale got its name from Olaf Reed (1827-1906), who settled there in the 1870s. Olaf Reed was a Norwegian immigrant who started a partnership with Oden Nelson. They operated vessels on the Coquille River between Myrtle Point and Bandon, Oregon. Reed was a former sea captain and like his brothers Edward and Hans, he also worked as a shipbuilder. Reed and Nelson started a general store in 1873. Norway's post office was established in 1876 and as of 2003, it had been moved a few miles from its first location. Norway post office closed in 2002; the community's mail is addressed to Myrtle Point. There was also a Norway station on the Southern Pacific Coos Bay Line. In 1977, the whole community was put up for sale. At the time the two-acre townsite consisted of a store with living quarters upstairs, a caf√©, a post office, a home, several old motel cabins and a defunct gas station. In the early 1990s the population was single digits, under 10.

He exercised an apostolate of charity and of the written word.Centenario del Dr. F√©lix Sard√° y Salvany, Barcelona, 1944 Historian Roberto de Mattei reports that Salvany \\"was a popular priest in Spain at the end of the century and was considered exemplary for the firmness of his principles and the clarity of his apostolate.\\" Revista popular For over forty years, he was the editor of the journal La Revista Popular, a weekly publication where all the current issues were discussed in light of the Catholic faith. From 1907 and until 1914, he published a series of twelve volumes entitled Progaganda catolica: it is a vast collection of short books, pamphlets, articles and conferences. Sard√† made use of his journal to publish a tirade of nine antisemitic pieces, La judiada (\\"the jewry\\"), describing jews as \\"a moth gnawing at the log of Christian people\\" coming out openly to destroy Christianism by using a plan based on masonismo; in the view of Sard√†, the understanding of masonismo should not be restricted to Freemasonry proper, but to liberalism in general. The Spanish bibliography of reference, Encyclopedia of Orientation bibliografica, says that Don Sard√† exercised an \\"apostolate of immense efficiency and resonance\\". He is also the author of a book on the Sacred Heart of Jesus, which was a great success and was reprinted until the late 1950s. Integrism F√©lix Sard√† y Salvany Salvany is most famous for his works against Liberalism (the ideas of personal autonomy and the separation of Church and State advocated by the Enlightenment). Salvany was among those that held liberals were not Catholic, and was called by his detractors as one of the \\"rigid ideologues\\" in this era of Spanish history. He condemned secularism and liberalism \\"as a sin and a poisonous sect for espousing 'the absolute sovereignty of the individual completely independent of God and of His authority; sovereignty of society absolutely independent of anything beyond itself; ...freedom of thought with no limitation whatsoever politically, morally, or religiously. ...[a condition that denied] the need for divine revelation.' ...[and resulted in a state] worse 'than being a blasphemer, thief, adulterer or murderer.'\\" Salvany held that Liberalism was a grave sin that needed to be combated, developing the thought of Pope Pius IX he wrote \\"It must be said that liberalism in the idea is the absolute error, and in facts the absolute disorder. As a consequence, in both cases, it is a grave sin through its own nature ex genere suo, and extremely grave sin, a mortal sin.\\" Background Salvany's writing against Liberalism rose to notability after the liberal Revolution of 1868 had led to the First Spanish Republic with its promise and disappointments. This republican form of government in turn had fallen to a military coup led by Arsenio Mart√≠nez- Campos y Ant√≥n that returned the Spanish monarchy in the Bourbon Restoration of 1874. Sard√† y Salvany, 1911. The Catholic Church during the interregnum of 1868-1874 had many of its privileges removed along with its status as the official religion of Spain. The movement to disestablish Catholicism from a place of governmental privilege was especially intense during 1873 when the Spanish Republic embraced the concept of separation between Church and State and moved to have a secular state. With the return of the Bourbons, Catholicism was returned to its previous status of having governmental endorsement and its accompanying privileges over all other faiths and creeds. Article 11 of the Constitution of 1876 reaffirmed Catholicism as the official religion of the state, extending toleration to other creeds as long as all their speech and activities was done solely in private. (The move towards secularism would not begin again until the Second Republic in the early 1930s.) Some of the civilian radicals who had supported the Revolution of 1868 were not just anticlerical but anti-religious which historian Noel Valis points to as \\"a sign of a growing alienation from the Church\\". Valis also points to the work of amateur sociologist Hugh James Rose, who was a Protestant chaplain to English, French and German mining companies in the Spanish mining city of Linares, Ja√©n. Rose collected anecdotes from the Spanish population on their views of religion which he included in the chapter \\"Decay of Faith in Spain\\" in his 1875 book Untrodden Spain.Rose, Hugh James (1875). \\"Decay of Faith in Spain.\\" In: Untrodden Spain, Vol. 1. London: Samuel Tinsley, pp. 224‚Äì250. Rose concluded that \\"The Church of Spain... is an institution which has lost its hold on the masses, both educated and uneducated.\\"Rose (1875), pp. 224‚Äì225. Rose also stated that he observed in the Spanish a \\"sense of spiritual drift, of having come unanchored from their religious moorings.\\" He recorded an increase of not only atheists and free thinkers but also a rise in the religiously indifferent and a decline of attendance at Catholic religious services. One literary man told Rose that he no longer believed in \\"the ceremonies or the rites of my Church; I pray to God at home\\"Rose (1875), p. 235. but that he has not publicly \\"renounced that credo; it is more convenient not to have an open rupture\\". In 1888 another observer found similar things as Rose stating that the educated classes \\"have lost their old belief, and have not found a new one.\\" The Catholic Church itself had been calling for a spiritual revival in Spain since the 1700s feeling that there was a presence of \\"spiritual decay\\". While Spanish society was still religious, the question of what it meant to be Catholic in Spain, or who was a Catholic were being raised by the population and this led to a sense that the Church's authority and the foundations of its faith were being undermined. Salvany, following the line of thought of Pius IX's 1864 encyclical Syllabus of Errors was among those who denounced secularism and blasted the liberals, maintaining that they were not Catholics. Those like Salvany who wanted a closer relationship between the Church and State were termed Integrists and held that liberalism denied \\"the need for divine revelation.\\" Though vocal the Integrists remained a distinct minority within the Spanish Church. The Integrists opposed the efforts of Antonio C√°novas del Castillo despite him having been a conservative who had opposed freedom of religion and letting the lower classes have a vote or voice in government. It was Canovas attempts to find a middle way (a \\"conservative liberalism\\") that upset the Integrists. Canovas had been the principal author of the 1876 Constitution and the Integrists took particular exception to its much-debated article 11 that granted toleration to religious minorities. Other figures opposed by the Integrists also tried to find a middle-path between conservatives and liberalism these include Alejandro Pidal, Manuel Dur√°n y Bas, Josep Coll i Veh√≠, and Juan Mane y Flaquer. The Integrists, motivated by a desire to prevent the introduction of temporal things into the spiritual, also found opposition within the Spanish Catholic clergy on \\"how to reconcile faith with historical change, with modernity.\\" Title Page of the sixth edition of El liberalismo es pecado, 1887. The critics of the Integrists and Salvany's journals and printed editorials questioned their use of mass-marketing techniques and the new freedom of the press and speech to spread their message (rather than relying on authority and traditional methods of communication) ‚Äì this was seen as participating \\"in the very modernity they found so objectionable.\\" Salvany also opted to try and combat liberalism in 1884 by calling for the founding of a Catholic political party (which again seemed to participate in the thing he was fighting against). He presented the call for a Catholic political party \\"as part of a national crusade, referring to Spain as 'the land of the eternal crusade.'\\" Liberalism is a Sin Salvany's most famous work was the 1884 book El liberalismo es pecado (which translates as \\"Liberalism is a Sin\\"). The book has been reprinted multiple times; by 1960 a 20th edition came out in Spain. ReferencesFurther reading * Moliner Prada, Antonio (2000).

He is best known as Nagulnov in Podniataya Tselina, based on Mikhail Sholokhov's novel; and Nekhludov in Resurrection (), based on Leo Tolstoy's novel. Early years Yevgeny Matveyev was born in the village of Novoukrainka in the Mykolaiv Governorate of the Ukrainian Soviet Socialist Republic (now Kherson Oblast, Ukraine) to Semyon Kalinovich Matveyev, a Red Army serviceman was stationed in the region at the end of the Russian Civil War, Nadezhda Fyodorovna Kovalenko, a local peasant woman, on 8 March 1922. His father left Nadezhda shortly after he was born. He attended school in the nearby town of Tsyurupinsk, where he saw his first play and left school after the ninth grade to pursue a career in acting. He made his first step on the professional stage at the Kherson Theater, in 1939. One of his first small stage roles was a part of a musician in Bestalanna. Russian actor Nikolai Cherkasov noticed the young talent and advised Matveyev to continue his acting career, by moving to Kiev to study with Alexander Dovzhenko. Doing so, Matveyev studied under Dovzhenko at the acting school of the Kiev Film Studio in 1940 and 1941. Matveyev joined the Red Army after the German invasion in 1941, and went to military school in Tyumen. After graduation, Lieutenant Matveyev was mobilized into the Red Army, and fought in World War II. After the end of the war, Matveyev worked for a year at the military school in Tyumen, as a director of the school's amateur theater art group, where he met his future wife, Lidiya Matveyeva. They married in April 1947.Veligzhanina, Anna (5 June 2003). \\"Lyubit po-russki - eto zhalet\\". Komsomolskaya Pravda. Retrieved 29 March 2011. Stage and screen success Maly Theater. Theater Square. Moscow After completing his military service in 1946, Matveyev acted at the Tyumen Drama Theater for two years, and at the Red Torch Theater in Novosibirsk from 1948 to 1952. In 1952, Matveyev went to Moscow to join the famed Maly Theater, where he continued his stage career until 1968. His various roles on the stage included Neznamov in Alexander Ostrovsky's drama Bez viny vinovatye, Zvonorev in Port Arthur, Yarovoy in Love of Yarovoy by Trenyev, Rodon in an adaptation of William Makepeace Thackeray's Vanity Fair, Trofimov in Alyoshin's Leading Role, Stolbov in Autumn Sunrise, Erast in Ostrovsky's Heart Not a Stone, and Osvald in Ibsen's Ghosts. Matveyev broke into film in the 1950s, when he starred as Sudbinin in Andrey Frolov's 1955 film Good Morning, a musical comedy. He played the leading part of Konstantin Davydov in The House I Live In, a 1955 film by Lev Kulidzhanov and Yakov Segel that won the first prize at the All-Union Film Festival. Matveyev achieved greater fame when he starred as Nagulnov in Virgin Soil Upturned, and played the role of Prince Nekhludov in Mikhail Shveitser's Resurrection, an adaptation of Tolstoy's novel. More of his notable roles during this period included the part of Fedotov in Blood Ties, in 1963, starring opposite Vija Artmane. The film won special prizes at international film festivals, including the Mar del Plata International Film Festival and in Buenos Aires, and also at the 1964 All-Union Film Festival in Leningrad. Directing and acting At the height of his fame, Matveyev's career as an actor came to a sudden end at a holiday celebration in Nikolaev, in what is now Ukraine: during a show, he fell off a malfunctioning cart; injuring his spine, crushing two disks, and jamming spinal nerves. After a long period of treatment, despite the opinion of his physician, he returned to work. Though the Soviet government had classified him in the third group of individuals with disabilities, those persons who had lost some capacity but were still capable of working, generally part-time; he quit performing on the stage and instead became a film director. His debut as a director was the 1967 film, The Gypsy, an adaptation of Anatoly Kalinin's novel. He also starred as Budulay, acting alongside Lyudmila Khityaeva in that film. Matveyev's first picture was greeted with differing opinions in the Soviet Union; though a survey by the magazine Soviet Screen named him one the best actors of 1967, there were a lot of critical remarks. From 1968 onward, Matveyev completely left theatre and continued his career in the film industry, as a director and an actor. He directed a historic-revolutionary film, Romance by Mail, and a melodrama, Deadly Enemy, and played the leading parts in both films; neither picture achieved great success, however. Among the many films Matveyev starred in during that period, perhaps Aleksei Saltykov's The Siberian Woman (), which garnered him a Best Actor award, and his part in Taming of the Fire, that of a factory director, show him at his best. In the middle of the 1970s, Yevgeny Matveyev stepped in as a director again. He filmed Earthly Love and Destiny. These pictures have a big success and audience sympathy even these social stories have been polished, which was a necessity of Soviet Era. Matveyev starred as a chairman of collective farm Zakhar Deryugin and Olga Ostroumova was his partner at this time. Another notable role in the 1970s was a part in Soldiers of Freedom, where he played Leonid Brezhnev, General Secretary of the Communist Party of the Soviet Union. This event affected his career dramatically: he became a secretary of the Cinematographers‚Äô Union of the USSR, and all his films received a \\"green light\\". But it affected Matveyev's life very quickly; in the middle of the 1980s, perestroika came, and, with it, came official censure: In 1986, at the Fifth Congress of the Cinematographers' Union, Evgeniy Matveyev was dismissed from his post as secretary, and was punished for his \\"polished pictures\\" and his role as Brezhnev. Undaunted, at the end of the 1980s, Matveyev returned to cinematography, filming a tragic melodrama Vessel of Patience () where he played a leading part, again with Olga Ostroumova as his partner. Vessel of Patience was honored with a Spectator Sympathies Prize at the \\"Constellation\\" () festival, but the picture remains relatively unknown. Later on, Matveyev took on roles in pictures about criminals, such as The Vacancy of Killer's Place and Clan. In the latter, he re-created Brezhnev once more, but this time in a different context and from a different point of view.  Later years  In 1995, Matveyev directed To Love the Russian Way, soon followed by To Love the Russian Way 2, filmed in 1997 with money sent by his fans from all over Russia. His final work of as director and actor was To Love the Russian Way 3, released in 1999. He died in Moscow from lung cancer on 1 June 2003, and was interred at Novodevichy Cemetery. Awards and honours During his lifetime, among other awards and honours, Yevgeny Matveyev was honoured with a State Prize of the USSR in 1977 and the Vasilyev Brothers State Prize of the RSFSR in 1978, a Dovzhenko Gold Medal for his role in High Title (1974), a Special Prize for the war film Destiny at the 1979 All-Union Film Festival, a best actor award for the role of Emelyan Pugachyov at the 1980 International Film Festival in Prague, and a best actor award for the leading part in To Love the Russian Way at the Tashkent International Film Festival (1997).

Harrison played in 396 first-class matches, 387 of which were for Hampshire. During his career Harrison made 8,854 runs at an average of 17.49 and took 578 catches and 103 stumpings. Early career Harrison joined the Hampshire ground staff in 1937 straight from school. A right-handed batsman, Harrison's primary role was as a wicketkeeper, but in his two pre-war matches and through several seasons after the Second World War he played mainly as a batsman while Neil McCorkell remained as first choice wicket keeper. He made his first-class debut as a 17-year-old in August 1939 at Bournemouth and played in Hampshire's last two county games before the outbreak of the second world war. Batting at number 7, he scored 9 and 12 respectively in his first match against Worcestershire which Hampshire lost by 32 runs and then 0 and 16 in the following match where Hampshire lost to Yorkshire by an innings and 11 runs. He then joined the RAF for the duration of the war. County Championship In the first championship season after the war in 1946 he remained on the fringe of the first eleven playing in just 7 championship matches and scoring only 100 runs at an average of 10.00. In 1947 he finally established himself in the side and played 18 championship matches, plus 4 other first-class games, scoring 567 runs and doubling his batting average to 20.25. Fittingly, he made his maiden century for Hampshire against Worcestershire at Southampton in 1951, which was instrumental helping Hampshire to a 5 wicket victory. That proved to be his best season with the bat, scoring 1189 runs at an average of 30.48. After McCorkell retired in 1951 Ralph Prouton took over as first choice wicket keeper for the 1952 season. After alternating with Prouton in 1953, he duly became first choice keeper from 1954 until 1962 when Brian Timms succeeded him. He continued to be available as reserve wicketkeeper but only played in one further championship match for Hampshire (aged 43) in the drawn match against Surrey in May 1966, where his last victim was skipper Mickey Stewart, who he caught for 13 off the bowling of Butch White. That appearance made him the last player to have appeared in a County Championship match who had previously played in a pre-war championship game. Other matches Harrison also represented the Combined Services in three first-class matches as well as one for the Royal Air Force against Worcestershire in 1946.https://cricketarchive.com/Archive/Players/6/6646/First- Class_Matches.html He also appeared in the annual Gentlemen v Players match at Lord's in 1955 (for the Players) and the MCC v Australians at Lord's in the following year. He continued to play regularly for the Hampshire 2nd XI up until 1969 before making a final appearance for them against Gloucestershire 2nd XI in June 1970 (aged 48). Addendum Harrison was a regular spectator at Hampshire matches at the Rose Bowl until the end of his life. He was a long-time friend of the cricket commentator John Arlott. He was the guest of honour at the unveiling of The Cricket Society plaque commemorating Arlott's residency at the Old Sun in New Alresford in 2009. By August 2015, he was one of only two surviving county cricketers who played before World War II, along with John Manners (also of Hampshire, born 1914).Hampshire cricket history: John Manners Retrieved 1 October 2014.

(October 1881 ‚Äì 3 August 1936)John Alf Brown player profile Scrum.com was a Welsh international rugby union forward player who played club rugby for Cardiff and county rugby for Glamorgan. Brown was capped seven times for Wales and although he missed facing the first touring South African team in 1906 with Wales, he faced the tourist with both Cardiff and Glamorgan. Brown was reputed to be an extremely tough and physical forward player,Billot (1974), pg 29. which was reflected in his manual occupation as a coal trimmer at Cardiff Docks. He died in 1936 from Pneumoconiosis. Rugby career=Club career Brown first came to note as a rugby player while representing Cardiff based team St. Peters RFC. Brown was made vice-captain of St. Peters, but in 1901 moved to first class team Cardiff.St. Peters History stpetersrfc.co.uk Brown first played for the Cardiff Senior XV during the 1901/02 season, under the captaincy of Bert Winfield.Davies (1975), pg 49. In late 1905, Brown was part of the Cardiff team to face the Original All Blacks, his first encounter with international opposition. In a very close match, Cardiff lost 10-8. The next season saw the South Africa tour Britain, and Brown faced them twice, at county and then club level. He first faced South Africa when he was selected to represent Welsh county team Glamorgan. Brown was a surprise choice and joined the team along with Cardiff team mates George Northmore, Bert Winfield, Rhys Gabe and Billy O'Neill. In a very quick paced game, the South Africans won 6-3, and then went on to beat Wales in a shock win a month later. On 1 January 1907 the South Africans met Cardiff in the last game of the tour, having only lost one match, against Scotland, in a 28-game campaign. The game was one of the highlights of the tour, with many of the Cardiff players having been humiliated by the South Africans in the Wales defeat, playing for pride. In the forwards, Brown, Casey and O'Neill worked tirelessly for Cardiff, against a South African team lacking unison;Davies (1975), pg 65. and it was from Brown's performance on this game that he would later win his Welsh cap.Davies (1975), pg 61. The final score was 17-0 to Cardiff, South Africa's only loss to a club side throughout the tour. During the 1907/08 season, Rhys Gabe was given the captaincy of Cardiff, and he made Brown his vice-captain.Davies (1975), pg 62. By the time Brown left Cardiff in 1910, he had played with the club for ten seasons, appeared in 221 matches and scored 12 tries.Davies (1975), pg 400. International career On 12 January 1907, Brown was selected for the Wales national team for the first time. He was brought into the squad for the opening match of the 1907 Home Nations Championship, played at home against England. Brown was one of four new caps in the Wales line-up, and one of two debuts in the pack; the other being Llanelli's James Watts. After the disappointing performance against South Africa, Wales rediscovered their form to beat England convincingly 22-0. Brown not only finished his first international with a win, but he also scored his first and only international points during the game with a try. After the opening game, Brown kept his place in the national team for the rest of the tournament, which saw the Welsh finish second behind Scotland. The 1908 Championship saw France face the Home Nation sides, in preparation for the country entering the competition proper in 1910. Brown played in three of the games, including the very first international game between Wales and France, but was replaced in the encounter with Ireland by Tom Evans. Wales won all four games that season, making Brown not only a Triple Crown winning player, but also a member of the very first Grand Slam winning team. Brown played in one final international for Wales, the 1909 Home Nations Championship opener against England. His career ended as it had started with a victory over the English, and despite taking no further part in the competition, was part of another Grand Slam winning squad when Wales beat all other four countries to win the Championship.

Penitentiaire Inrichting Vught (English: Penitentiary Institution Vught) is now the general term used instead of Nieuw Vosseveld. Part of Nieuw Vosseveld is a maximum security prison; it holds some of Europe's most dangerous criminals including Islamic terrorists Mohammed Bouyeri and Samir Azzouz. History=World War II During World War II, Nazi Germany occupied the Netherlands (1940‚Äì1945). The Nazis transported Jewish and other prisoners from the Netherlands via the transit camps Amersfoort and Westerbork to concentration camps such as Auschwitz and Bergen-Belsen. When Amersfoort and Westerbork appeared to be too small to handle the large number of prisoners, the Schutzstaffel decided to build a concentration camp in Vught near the larger city 's-Hertogenbosch, with a series of sub camps. The building of the camp Herzogenbusch, the German name for 's-Hertogenbosch, started in 1942. The camp was modeled after the concentration camps in Germany. The camp held male and female prisoners captured in Belgium and the Netherlands. The guard staff included SS men and a few SS women, headed by Oberaufseherin Margarete Gallinat. The Nazis initially used this location as a transit camp to gather prisoners for classification and transportation to Poland and other camps. The first prisoners, that arrived in 1943, had to finish building the camp. The camp was used from January 1943 until September 1944. During this period, the camp held nearly 31,000 prisoners: Jews, political prisoners, resistance fighters, gypsies, Jehovah‚Äôs Witnesses, homosexuals, homeless people, black market traders, criminals and hostages. Dutch underground members Corrie and Betsie ten Boom were held at Vught in 1944, before being sent to Ravensbr√ºck concentration camp. Poncke Princen, who would later become known for going over to the Indonesian guerrillas opposing Dutch rule, was also imprisoned at Vught for his anti-Nazi activities. Due to hunger, sickness and abuse at least 749 children, women and men died in the concentration camp. 329 of them were executed at the execution site, just outside the camp. When Allied forces were approaching Herzogenbusch, the camp was evacuated and the prisoners were transferred to concentration camps further to the east. When the camp was liberated in September 1944, by the 4th Canadian Armored Division and the 96th Battery of the 5th Anti-Tank Division, the camp was almost deserted. Camp in post-war times After World War II, the camp was first used as a prison for Germans and \\"wrong\\" people: Dutch SS-men, (suspected) collaborators and/or their children, and war criminals. At first, they were guarded by Allied soldiers, but shortly after by the Dutch. As a parliamentary enquiry (the Committee A.M. Baron Tuyll van Serooskerken) showed in 1950, this resulted in maltreatment and even summary executions. Later, the barracks of Camp Vught were made available to Indonesian Moluccans, for use as their living quarters. The former barracks were first converted into a number of home units. In 1953, part of the camp was fenced off for use as a facility for juveniles who had been given a lengthy (i.e. over 5 years), sentence. The current building was designed by architects and Maris van den Berg, with a capacity of 120 to 140 detainees. The regime in the establishment was quite progressive for the time, with cell doors left open during the day. In the early 1970s, an adult facility was added, which included a hospital. When in 1993 the high security EBI unit was move to Nieuw Vosseveld, and the hospital moved to Scheveningen prison. In 1999, a forensic psychiatric unit, where inmates with a serious mental disorder can be placed. Recently, the prison opened a department where terrorist suspects can be held, which uses part of the original juvenile building. This department was in the Dutch news because the cells did not meet the fire safety requirements. This came to light in a nationwide investigation following the fire at the deportation center at Schiphol airport. Presently, PI Vught has 15 different regimes and a capacity for 750 prisoners and TBS-ers (i.e. subject to involuntary commitment). TEBI and EBI Increasing violence of some detainees created a need for a facility where inmates with a high risk of violence could be securely detained. In 1993 Nieuw Vosseveld initially had a temporary maximum security facility called TEBI, and since 1996 a permanent maximum security facility known as (\\"Extra Security Institution\\", EBI) is part of Nieuw Vosseveld. The regime in the EBI is very stringent, with detainees given minimal freedom from their cells. Detainees are moved between units while being handcuffed, and even external exercise cells are caged-enclosed. The EBI presently has a capacity of 18 detainees, and an occupation of on average 9 detainees. PI Vught TBS PI Vught TBS houses two units, designed in close collaboration with Prof WPJ Pompestichting. There is a section for active treatment of 24, added to in 2007 by a new long-stay unit opened for the accommodation of 22 patients.

Private life David Stuart was the son of William Stuart, rector of St. Paul's Parish, King George County, Virginia. His grandfather, also named David Stuart, had come to Virginia from Scotland in 1715 and served as rector of the same church. Stuart studied medicine and languages at the University of St Andrews.\\"Washington to Dr. Stuart: Some Unpublished Letters of the First President\\", New York Times, March 14, 1880, p. 4 He established a practice in Alexandria, Virginia. He became a relative of George Washington's in 1783 when he married Eleanor Calvert Custis, the widow of Washington's stepson John Parke Custis and a descendant of Cecilius Calvert, Lord Baltimore, the recipient of the charter for the Maryland colony. A number of letters from Washington to Stuart exist, concerning family matters and Virginia politics. Eleanor and David had sixteen children of their own, including: * Ann Calvert Stuart Robinson (born 1784), married William Robinson * Sarah Stuart Waite (born 1786), married Obed Waite * Ariana Calvert Stuart * William Skolto Stuart * Eleanor Custis Stuart (born 1792) * Charles Calvert Stuart (1794-1846), married Cornelia Lee * Rosalie Eugenia Stuart Webster (1796-1886), married William Greenleaf Webster In addition, Stuart helped raise John Parke Custis's and Eleanor's two eldest children, Elizabeth Parke Custis Law and Martha Parke Custis Peter. The Stuarts and their family resided at three estates in Fairfax County, Virginia: Abingdon, Hope Park and Ossian Hall. Eleanor died on September 28, 1811. Political career Stuart served as a representative to the Virginia House of Delegates and also to the Virginia convention of 1788 that considered the ratification of the United States Constitution..

Four S.E.4a aircraft were built, being used for research purposes and as home-defence fighters by the Royal Flying Corps. In spite of its type number it had little or no relationship to the earlier S.E.4 Development and design In 1915, Henry Folland of the Royal Aircraft Factory designed a new single-engined scout aircraft, the S.E.4a. While it had a similar designation to Folland's earlier Royal Aircraft Factory S.E.4 of 1914, which had been designed to be the fastest aircraft in the world, the S.E.4a was fundamentally a new aircraft, intended to investigate the relationship between stability and manoeuvrability, and for possible operational use.Bruce 1968, pp. 72‚Äì73. The resulting design was a single-engined, single bay biplane. The fuselage structure was of mixed construction, with a steel tube forward section and a wooden box-girder rear section.Bruce 1968, p. 73. The first prototype's fuselage was smoothly faired out to a circular section using formers and stringers, with the forward fuselage back to the cockpit covered in metal skinning and the rear fuselage fabric covered.Lewis 1979, pp. 54‚Äì55. The wood and fabric single-bay wings, unlike the S.E.4, had noticeable stagger between the upper and lower wings, but were fitted with similar, full span control surfaces which could be moved differentially as ailerons or together as camber changing flaps, to those used on the S.E.4.Bruce 1982, p. 469. The first prototype's engine, an 80 hp (60 kW) Gnome rotary engine, was mounted within a smooth cowling driving a two-bladed propeller fitted with a large, blunt spinner. This was found to lead to engine overheating and was replaced by a more conventional arrangement.Mason 1992, p. 32. The remaining three prototypes had simpler structures, with flat-sided fuselages, and many of the drag reducing features of the first prototype omitted. They were powered by a range of engines of similar power to that used in the first prototype, including Clerget and Le Rh√¥ne rotaries. Operational history The first prototype flew on 25 June 1915, with the remaining three aircraft all having flown by mid August.Bruce 1968, p. 74. The S.E.4a proved easy to fly, demonstrating excellent aerobatic capabilities,Bruce 1957, p. 444. but were overweight and underpowered, and was not developed further.Bruce 1982, p. 470. Two of the aircraft, armed with a Lewis gun mounted above the upper wing were issued to Home Defence squadrons of the Royal Flying Corps in the winter of 1915‚Äì16, based at Hounslow Heath Aerodrome and Joyce Green. One of these was lost in a fatal crash on 24 September 1915. The third prototype remained in use for trials purposes until September 1917.Bruce 1968, p. 75.

Formerly a NATO military airfield, it was closed in 1992. In 1996, a large part of the airfield site was placed under the control of Technische Universit√§t Darmstadt, where a variety of disciplines carry out experiments and operate several small aircraft.August Euler Airfield - Historical Overview Griesheim was originally part of an Imperial German Army (Reichsheer) military artillery firing range in 1874, an airfield was established on the site in 1908, being Germany's first airfield and flight school. During World War I it was used as a Prisoner of War Camp. Re-established as an airfield in 1930, the German Research Institute for Gliding was established on the site. After 1939, the Luftwaffe established a military presence at the airfield, and after World War II, it was a United States Army Airfield (Darmstadt Army Airfield) until the end of the Cold War, jointly used in the late 1980s as civil airport for light aircraft and sailplanes (Griesheim Airport).Translated from German Wikipedia Article Truppen√ºbungsplatz Griesheim History=Origins In 1874, the area south of Griesheim was established as a German Army artillery firing range. In 1908, August Euler recognized the suitability of the site as an airfield, and conducted the first glider flights at the location of the current airfield in December 1908. Afterward, he presented to the German government a request to lease a portion of the site (380 acres) for use as an airfield. Early in 1909 the lease was completed. In February, August Euler erected a building on the site, which he relocated from Mainz castle, costing him 2,400 Marks. In that building he began aircraft production. On 31 December 1909, he earned the first civil pilot's license in Germany. Between 1909 and 1911 in Griesheim Euler trained 74 pilots. The most famous student pilot was Prince Henry of Prussia, the brother of the German Emperor. In 1913 the airfield was designated \\"Flying station Darmstadt-Griesheim\\" and was taken over by the German Army. During World War I, the airfield was turned into a Prisoner of War Camp, eventually holding over 15,000 soldiers. At the end of the war, the Treaty of Versailles prohibited German military flying, and the French Army moved into the area for occupation duty. The occupying force remained until 1930 when the French military withdrew. After the withdrawal of the French in June 1930 the airfield was re-established. In April 1932 the city of Darmstadt, leased the approximately airfield for their new airport. In May 1933 the German Research Institute for Gliding (DFS) moved their institution into the barracks at the airport formerly used by the French. The DFS was a civilian facility. During the 1930s its mission was primarily to research gliders and their uses. The Institute established research facility hangars, workshops, and in 1936 a wind tunnel, which is used today by the Technische Universit√§t Darmstadt. Up to 780 employees were employed at the DFS, including the staff of the Engineering School of Aeronautical Engineering (IfL). By October 1937, the entire facility along with the airfield had expanded to about 800 hectares. Luftwaffe Use When World War II broke out in 1939, DFS was moved north to Braunschweig in Lower Saxony and then to Ainring in Upper Bavaria. The German Air Force (Luftwaffe) then established itself at the airfield. During its use by the Luftwaffe, the airport was known as \\"Fliegerhorst Darmstadt-Griesheim\\", and was generally used by Fighter units. The Luftwaffe, 1933-45 The first combat unit assigned was Zerst√∂rergeschwader 2 (ZG 2) in April 1940, being equipped with the Messerschmitt Bf 110C heavy fighter. The unit took part in the Battle of France from May‚ÄìJune 1940. On 4 May the French and British Air Forces launched a series of desperate attacks against the bridges around Sedan at a heavy cost. ZG 2 helped provide air cover. In July with the battle won ZG 2 moved into France. Jagdgeschwader 3 (JG 3), a Messerschmitt Bf 109E fighter unit moved to Darmstadt-Griesheim in late February 1941 after taking severe losses during the Battle of Britain. At the field the unit was rearmed, and additional pilots were assigned. In early May, the unit moved east into Poland for eventual action against the Soviet Union during Operation Barbarossa. Darmstadt-Griesheim became a key base in late 1944 as part of the \\"Defense of the Reich\\" campaign against American Eighth Air Force heavy bombing raids against targets in Germany. No less than two fighter units, Jagdgeschwader 53 (JG 53) and Jagdgeschwader 4 (JG 4), equipped with Focke-Wulf Fw 190A and a few Messerschmitt Bf 109E fighters used for day interceptor missions against the American bomber fleets. A third unit, Nachtjagdgeschwader 11 (NJG 11), flew Fw 190s and Bf 109s as night interceptors against Royal Air Force Bomber Command Lancasters attacking at night. Beginning in mid-to-late 1944, after the Allies landed in Normandy and began to move east into central France, Darmstadt-Griesheim came into the effective range of USAAF Ninth Air Force B-26 Marauder medium bombers and P-47 Thunderbolts. The airfield came under more and more Frequent attack by the American mediums and tactical fighter bombers, mostly with 500-pound General-Purpose bombs; unguided rockets and .50 caliber machine gun sweeps when Eighth Air Force heavy bombers (B-17s, B-24s) were within interception range of the Luftwaffe aircraft assigned to the base. The attacks were timed to have the maximum effect possible to keep the interceptors pinned down on the ground and be unable to attack the heavy bombers. Also the P-51 Mustang fighter-escort groups of Eighth Air Force would drop down on their return to England and attack the base with a fighter sweep and attack any target of opportunity to be found at the airfield.Derived from information in USAAF Film \\"Target For Today\\" (available at https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kkGL7vuC2A4) Wartime American Use United States Army units began to move into the Darmstadt area in mid-March 1945, and elements of the Third United States Army captured Darmstadt-Griesheim airfield about 25 March. Combat engineers from IX Engineer command moved in with the 832d, 850th, and 826th Engineering Aviation Battalions arriving on 27 March 1945, to repair the runway for use by combat aircraft. The engineers bulldozed soil into the bombed runway and laid down Pierced Steel Planking over the damaged runway to make it operational for use. The engineers also performed minimal repairs to the facility to make it operational. On 28 March, the airfield was declared ready for Allied use and was designated as Advanced Landing Ground \\"Y-76 Darmstadt/Griesheim \\".IX Engineering Command ETO Airfields General Construction Information Almost immediately, C-47 Skytrain transports began using the new airfield to fly in supplies and munitions to the ground units, and evacuate combat casualties to the rear areas and was also used by the 72d Liaison Squadron, flying light observation and courier aircraft. After the combat ended in May Griesheim Airfield was redesignated Army Air Force Station Darmstadt/Griesheim and became the home of several command and control organizations. Headquarters, 63d Fighter Wing; 64th Fighter Wing, and 71st Fighter Wing used the airfield between July and November 1945. In addition, Air Technical Service Command used the airfield as a storage depot for captured Luftwaffe aircraft prior to them being destroyed or some being transferred back to the United States. It was closed by the Air Force in October 1945.Johnson, David C.

Postwar occupation With the Air Force units moved out, the airfield became part of the United States Army forces in Darmstadt, and the airfield was renamed Darmstadt Army Airfield. Over the years, Darmstadt served as home for thousands of American soldiers and their families. The Airfield was home to the following units: Griesheim Army Airfield usarmygermany.com * 1959, V Corps Artillery. Aviation units of V Corps and 7th Army also use the field. Aircraft based at the airfield included: H-13s, H-19s, L19s and L20s. * 1965, Btry F, 26th Arty (the V Corps artillery aviation battery); 4th Pltn, 421st Med Air Abm Co (a medical evacuation unit); Air Section, HQ 10th Arty Gp * 1989, 14 US Army medical helicopters (UH-60 Blackhawks) of the 159th Medical Co (Air Ambulance) In addition to the military mission, a civilian American flying club was located at the airfield in 1989 - the Darmstadt Flying Club. The club had 200 members (the vast majority are US servicemembers) who flew five Cessna 152 trainers and two Cessna 172's. (The club was originally located in Hanau but moved to Griesheim in 1986.) U.S. Army Garrison Darmstadt officially ended six decades of service at its inactivation ceremony 5 Aug 2008. Today, many wartime relics can be found at Griesheim Airport. Restrictions on U.S. Army aviation imposed in 1947 by the establishment of the United States Air Force meant that Army aviation units assigned to the airfield were limited to helicopter and light courier and liaison aircraft. Although the Army removed the wartime runway and laid down a new asphalt one, many of the wartime taxiways and aircraft dispersal hardstands remain on the airfield today. A large German hangar was repaired and remained in use until the aviation units were withdrawn in 1993. The support area of the airfield, contains several buildings used by the German Research Institute for Gliding, including the wind-tunnel. Several wartime-era barracks were renovated and kept in good repair over the years as well.

It was one of a few movies made by the short-lived Affiliated Productions, who released through Screen Guild Productions. Plot summary Taking place in rural Missouri, 1864, the area is far from the front lines and has been torn apart by partisan and guerrilla warfare, leaving it at the mercy of outlaws. Jean Shelby (Ann Savage) comes from a family of southern sympathizers, herself included. She gets information from Union soldiers and provides it to her brother with hopes of helping the confederacy. The film begins with Shelby riding on the road with her horse, as she passes flaming ruins she is approached by some Union troops who demand they meet with their superior officer, Major Barker (Jack Holt). Shelby attempts to flee, but is corned by more northern soldiers and she complies to meet with Major Barker. At the Union headquarters, rogue Native American Chief Whitecloud (Chief Thundercloud) offers information of Jean's sister Bob Shelby. Barker pays Whitecloud $10 to reveal Bob's location in Fontana and tells his men to hang Whitecloud, should the information turn out to be false. When a subordinate of Barker's ask why they should trust Whitecloud, Barker reveals that Whitecloud has a goal of destroying the Shelby family. Sometime ago, Whitecloud tried to kidnap Jean's mother, he was caught and the Cherokee kicked him out. Whitecloud has been a murderous renegade ever since, while still pursuing the Shelbys. Later, Sergeant James (Edmund Cobb) brings Jean Shelby to Major Barker While Barker is distracted talking to Union Captain Raymond ( Alan Curtis ), Shelby pulls a gun on her guard. When Barker and Raymond come into the room to check on the commotion, she makes both men drop their guns. She then escapes out the window and flees on Raymond's horse, leaving Barker furious and Raymond in awe. Jean rides to her parents' house to warn them of Whitecloud's impending arrival and to get her wounded brother Bob Shelby out of harm's way. Jean and Bob make it out minutes before Whitecloud and the Union soldiers arrive. Union soldiers search the Shelby home, but find nothing. Whitecloud sneaks off from the soldiers and finds Raymond's horse outback, Whitecloud sets out to find Jean and Bob alone. While riding, Bob falls off his horse. Unable to continue riding, Bob tells Jean to go on without him, Jean leaves Bob under a tree and continues onward. Whitecloud finds Bob alone, meanwhile Jean soon encounters Raymond on the road. They have a civil conversation that is interrupted by the sound of Bob's gunfire, they go to investigate, only to find that Bob has been killed by Whitecloud.

Jean and Raymond then setoff to find Whitecloud together. After cutting the ropes around Raymond's hand, Jean tells him to go back so she can bring her brother's body home. Raymond convinces her to set up camp for the night and to let him stay. They begin to form a connection after Raymond reveals his first name and Shelby talks about the work she did during the war with her brother, and now that he is dead she doesn't feel the need to be an outlaw like she once was. When Raymond asks why she is telling him all this, she replies by kissing him. That same night Whitecloud surrounded by other outlaws boasts about killing Bob Shelby and rallies the outlaws to ride into the night with him to find Jean and cause whatever chaos they can. In the morning Jean and Raymond hear Whitecloud and his men causing a commotion. He and his men have killed Jeans parents and set their house on fire. When Jean arrives on the scene she is wounded by Whitecloud and saved by Raymond. While recovering in bed, the doctor tells Raymond that her chances of survival are slim.

Later Jean is visited by her friends Jerry Long (Russell Wade) and Bob Crandall (Edward Brophy). Jerry reveals that although the war is over he and a few of Quantrail's men are still acting as if the war had not ended, looking for northerners to kill for money. Jerry wants Jean to join them and asks for her hand in marriage. Jean refuses calling him an outlaw. Jerry reveals she too is a wanted outlaw for helping Quantrail. After some hesitation, Jean accepts the offer to join Jerry and his men if they move to kill Whitecloud first. Raymond soon returns to where Jean has been recovering, only to find a note from her saying she has left to take care of personal business. Raymond decides he must find her.

The outlaws reveal that they Whitecloud is headed for the country, but the Yankee Cavalry is on their way to intercept Whitecloud and Jean's band of outlaws. Jerry calls off the deal and kills the remaining outlaws. Jean discovers from a dying Bob that Jerry did this so she sends him at gunpoint without any supplies.

Licensed to Canton, Mississippi, United States, the station serves the Jackson, Mississippi area. The station is currently owned by WMGO Broadcasting Corp. History On July 10, 1952, the Madison County Broadcasting Company, owned by Annie Dee Davis, James T. Ownby, and J. Dige Bishop, received a construction permit from the Federal Communications Commission for a new daytime-only radio station on 1370 kHz at Canton. Originally broadcasting with 500 watts, WMGO began broadcasting in 1953; it was approved to increase power to 1,000 watts the next year. The original owners filed to transfer control of the station to W. E. Farrar, R. E. and Lucille Hook, and Hugh Hughes in 1956; Hook bought out Farrar and Hughes the next year. In 1963, the Hooks sold the station to Roy James Loflin, Jr., and Wilbur Rodney Williams. As the sale awaited completion, the station was briefly taken off-air in April when a tractor plowed into the transmission line; the engineer intervened in time to prevent the driver from touching the electrified wiring. The new owners relaunched the station as WMGO on July 9, 1963, from new studios. Two years later, they sold WMGO to the Canton Broadcasting Corporation. Under Canton Broadcasting ownership, the station continued to have an almost entirely White air staff, with the only Black personalities featured on Sunday mornings. Canton retained the station for more than 15 years, selling to two men from Fairhope, Alabama, in 1981; they owned the station until 1990, when it was sold to McCulloch. New investors were brought in in 1993. WMGO was joined by an FM sister station in 1997 when owner Jerry Lousteau built WMGO-FM 93.1, licensed to Yazoo City. In 2014, WMGO owner Lousteau revealed that political ads placed on the station against United States Senate candidate Chris McDaniel, linking him to the Ku Klux Klan, had been placed by a Democratic Party operative.

Gordon, R.N., a retired Naval Officer, and assistant director of the Dominion Meteorological Service. Gordon named it in honor of one of the expedition's meteorological observers, Herbert M. Burwell of London, Ontario. Burwell was left in charge of Observing Station No. 1 in the port's harbour on the western side of Gray Strait until it closed in 1886. Gordon returned to Port Burwell with a Hudson's Bay Company expedition in 1885 on the Alert, and established an HBC trading post within the harbour. In 1904, Moravian missionaries established a mission and trading post at the northwest corner of the harbour. Twelve years later, the HBC moved one of their trading posts to the northeast area of the harbour. In the 1920s, a Royal Canadian Mounted Police detachment was set up at Port Burwell. The Royal Corps of Signals (RCCS) built a radio station, and the Coast Guard built a base. The settlement of Killiniq grew around the port.

The zone was created in 1980 by the Montgomery County Council to preserve farm land and rural space in the northwestern part of the county. The farmland protection program has been characterized as \\"the most famous, most studied and most emulated\\" program of its kind in the United States. Background Sugarloaf Mountain County residents and government planners began to notice the loss of agricultural land and open space as early as the 1950s, associated with the increase in suburbanization following World War II.Montgomery County Planning Department, Silver Spring, MD. \\"Preservation of Agriculture & Rural Open Space Functional Master Plan.\\" Updated 2013-02-13. The general demand for housing in the region was making the farm land increasingly attractive to developers, and the increased property values encouraged many farmers to sell. About one half of the county's farm land was converted to non-farm ownership by the 1960s. The Maryland-National Capital Park and Planning Commission noted a loss of acres of farm land over an 8-year period in the 1970s, an average of 2,346 acres/year. Following studies by a County task force and public discussion, the Council established the Agricultural and Rural Open Space Master Plan in 1980. The overall goals of the agricultural zone are to preserve farms, productive soils, and a way of life. It seeks to preserve farmland through: * Control of public costs and prevention of urban sprawl * Adherence to County growth management systems * Preservation of regional food supplies * Energy conservation * Protection of the environment * Maintenance of open space * Preservation of rural life styles. The county government identified two contiguous areas in its northern region that would define the outer boundaries of the agricultural zone. The first area, near the towns of Poolesville and Barnesville, was and contained most of the contiguous farmland. The second area, east of Olney, was , and had some farmland but was fragmented with residential subdivisions. However, the county decided that some of the remaining farmland and open space in this area could be preserved if future residential development was clustered. Rural density transfer zone and Transferable Development Rights Beallsville The 1980 legislation authorized the County government to define a Rural Density Transfer Zone within the Agricultural Reserve, wherein development of new housing is limited to one house per . Previously the allowed density was one house per . The County Council compensated the rural property owners for their loss of developability, through the creation of a legal property right called a Transferable Development Right (TDR). The council assigned one TDR for every five acres of rural land in the designated area. A TDR could be sold to someone who wanted to build elsewhere in the county, at a greater density than would otherwise be allowed in that non-rural zone.Montgomery County Planning Department (2001). \\"Plowing New Ground.\\" Booklet explaining the County's TDR program.Montgomery County Department of Economic Development, Derwood, MD (2010). \\"Farmland Preservation in Montgomery County: Purchase of Development Rights Programs.\\" Brochure. Montgomery County planners estimated that between 1981 and 2007 there were transactions that severed 9,700 TDRs from agricultural zone properties. About two-thirds of those rights were transferred to receiving area development projects elsewhere in the county. The county established a task force in 2001 to analyze and facilitate transactions between \\"supply\\" properties and receiving areas. Reducing farmland fragmentation In 2008 the County established a Building Lot Termination Program as an additional measure to address fragmentation of farmland. The program authorizes creation of easements on lots where the TDR program may not be applicable, to restrict non-agricultural land uses in the reserve zone. Similar in concept to a TDR, the easement creates a marketable credit for a landowner, and removes the right to build a dwelling unit on a lot. The landowner may sell the credit to a developer for use in another designated zone within the county. The program has preserved acres of agricultural land as of 2016. Benefits The County Agricultural Reserve is home to farms, wineries and natural spaces According to an advocacy group, the reserve provides the following benefits: * There are more than of farmland to enjoy in upper Montgomery County * Provides pick-your-own produce * Serves as a \\"green lung\\" for the greater Washington, D.C. area, cooling and cleaning the air * Employs over 10,000 people * Contributes $250 million to the economy * Offers recreational activities ** riding ** cycling ** hiking ** longboarding ** canoeing ** fishing ** hunting * Habitats for animals * Historical sites: ** Civil War sites ** Underground Railroad ** 18th and 19th century homes, barns, mills, and schools. Potential changes Among the challenges to maintaining the character of the Agricultural Reserve, are several listed by a local advocacy group: The high costs of operating a farm in Montgomery County; increased development of private facilities (e.g. private schools); and development of new highways.

It has 260 houses. It is located in Northern Punjab at 33¬∞25'36N 72¬∞57'25E with an altitude of 434 metres (1423 ft) and lies south of the district capital, Rawalpindi. The latest consolidation operation was held in 1986. Descendants of those that held leadership positions during the Sikh Empire and British Raj continue to use the awarded Dhalla title and some families have even adopted Dhalla as a surname. History Before the independence of Pakistan in 1947, Dhalla was mostly populated by Sikhs. Following the 1947 partition, Sikhs migrated back to India peacefully along with their brotherhood. Majority of Sikhs from Dhalla have migrated to Jalandhar, India and Patiala, India since the Pakistani partition. There are some remains of man-made caves in the hills of Dhalla that used to provide shelter from the rain for herds and farmers. The caves were broken down for construction purposes, so the last remembrance of Sikhs vanished around the 2000s. Prior to the Sikh Government in Dhalla, it was a famous state of Pakhral Rajput and they ruled between Dhalla to Chantal. Location and geography Dhalla is located on a hill on Adiala Road. It is away from the Islamabad International Airport and from Rawalpindi. Surrounding Dhalla has 2 dams in its surrounding areas, Jawa Dam and Khasala Dam in the village before Dhalla. The river Sawan is passing in front of the village. The bed of Sawan river is very fertile and full of greenery which have an outstanding look from the top of the village. The temperature in winter may decrease to 1 c and in June may rise up to 55 c. Mostly people are farmers and make their income from farming but the new generation know is moving towards industrial and government departments. Education There are a number of government educational institutions being developed in the town, such as * Govt. High School Dhalla for boys. * Govt. Primary School Dhalla for boys. * Govt. Girls High School Dhalla for girls. Students from nearby villages come and study in these schools. Some private English Medium schools are also there in the town. Health There is a government hospital in the town with several beds spaces. It is an old hospital before the independence. Its building structure was old style recently new building constructed on the same place. One family welfare center is available and one private clinic is also in the town, people from nearby villages come and get treatment and medicine for small diseases and injuries from the hospital and clinic. Telecommunication The PTCL provides the main network of landline telephone. Many ISPs and all major mobile phone and wireless companies operating in Pakistan provide service in Dhalla. Religion There are five mosques in the town Jamia Mosque, Farooq'e Azam Mosque and Bilal Mosque. One under construction Madrasa Hanfia Farooqia is also in the town for Islamic education and memorizing the Quran. There is an accommodation for student of Madrasa. This runs with the help of locals and charities. Approximately 99% population of the town is Sunni Muslims. Agriculture Dhalla is an agricultural town in this area. People harvest the vegetables and Approximately 80% population is attached with this field. A significant proportion of the population belong to the Minhas rajpoot (Pakhraal),Awan and khengar tribe and their lives and source of income totally depend on their agricultural land of the Sawan river bed which consist of very fertile soil of Sawan river. The people of Dhalla also use the water of jawa dam for cultivation Water reservoir Jawa Dam is a small water reservoir. It located Dhungi Reserved Forest. This dam was designed to irrigate 800 acres of land with irrigation requirement of 0.783 MCM at cropping intensity of 100%. Jawa dam became operational in 1997. Since its inception, the dam received almost constant inflow till 2000. However, after 2000, the inflow decreased gradually most probably due to decrease in rainfall. Except for the year 1998 and 2002, the outflow has been less than the inflow. Because this dam is built on a perennial stream, it received regular and constant flow throughout the year. However, the flow is relatively high in June to August, due to monsoon. The total average annual inflow to dam is 0.687 MCM, whereas, outflow is 0.777 MCM. In this case the discharge is more than the inflow. However, the available irrigation supply from the dam is almost equal the designed irrigation requirement of 0.783 MCM. Therefore, in general, the available water is sufficient to irrigate the designed area. But unfortunately the dam serves very less to the land of Dhalla although the dam is situated at the land of Dhalla.

He specializes in horrorcore music. Personal life Mars was born in Antioch, California, and raised throughout East Contra Costa County, primarily in the city of Pittsburg. He is of Mexican-American ethnicity. He attended Liberty High School and Pittsburg Adult Education before dropping out of his regular curriculum and enrolling in various college courses, including photography, marketing and communication, and publication design. Mars has three children, born in 1999, 2001 and 2007. His son Gavin has appeared in promotional videos, on stage, press, and music videos alongside his father, including the Kung Fu Vampire music video for \\"Love Bites.‚Äù Career Delgado began his rap career in 1997. Along with childhood friend J RZ, he formed Mad Insanity Records, through which they released their basement-style tapes to their friends locally. His stage name \\"Mars\\" was a nickname he had been called by classmates as a shortened version of his given name. In 1998, he released his first unofficial project, S.I.D.S., on homemade cassettes and CD-Rs. Lyrical topics included rape, suicide, murder, and abortion. The tape is now considered a collector‚Äôs item by fans. On May 9, 1999, J RZ, Mars, and several Mad Insanity Records artists and crew members were involved in a fight with Detroit rappers Eminem and Proof at The Fillmore in San Francisco during Eminem's performance on his first headlining \\"Slim Shady\\" tour. The incident was published in several notable hip-hop blogs and Bay Area newspapers, allowing Mad Insanity Records to gain a regional buzz. In 2001, Mars signed with Black Market Records and helped found Rest In Peace Records with Rod and Anthony Singleton. That same year, Mars helped sign horrorcore pioneer Ganxsta NIP and released the Houston, Texas, artist's album The Return of the Psychopath nationwide. Mars also headed the album‚Äôs publicity and marketing as project manager for the album. When Black Market CEO Cedric Singleton observed the success Mars achieved with the project management of Ganxsta NIP, he was assigned to oversee the latest album from rap artist Big Lurch, All Bad. The Rest In Peace moniker was shortlived, due in part to Mars requesting his release from the label to push his own Mad Insanity Records. In 2005, Mars released his debut album, Mars Attacks, with online stores selling out of copies on the first day of pre-orders, two weeks before the album‚Äôs release. Later that year, he received national attention when fan Jeff Weise, who had frequented Mars' website and forum, killed nine people. Mars stated on his website that he had no link to Weise whatsoever other than Weise being a fan of his music. Due to media attention and buzz, he gained the attention of hip-hop distribution label Beyond Spaced Entertainment and re-released Mars Attacks to stores worldwide.http://www.discogs.com/label/Beyond+Space+Entertainment That same year, Mars was used as the model of a character in Hostage, a movie based on a novel by Robert Crais. The movie was adapted for the screen by Doug Richardson, with the Mars-influenced role played by Ben Foster. On August 19, 2008, Psychopathic Records and sub-label Hatchet House released their Tunnel Runners compilation, featuring material from underground rappers and groups not signed to the label.http://www.insaneclownposse.com/carnival/iframe.php?page_id=icp_news&month;=8&year;=2008#a2 The compilation entered the Billboard Top 25 Rap Albums chart in its first week. After the Mars track \\"They Watchin Me\\" featuring Mike Marshall became the most popular song on the project, Violent J of the group Insane Clown Posse invited Mars to perform on Psychopathic Records‚Äô \\"Shock Therapy Tour\\" alongside Anybody Killa, Blaze Ya Dead Homie, Boondox, Axe Murder Boyz, and J Reno. After Boondox experienced medical issues from a prior surgery, Mars replaced the artist on Insane Clown Posse's 2008 ‚ÄúHallowicked Clown Tour.‚Äù In 2009, soon after the release of his album School House Glock: Extra Credit, a project that blatantly poked fun at his previous controversy, Delgado received international attention once again when Mars fan Richard Sam McCroskey killed four people. McCroskey's MySpace page listed Mars as his favorite rapper, and Mars told law enforcement he had seen and signed autographs for McCroskey at various events before the murders. Following these events, Delgado was interviewed by several TV news outlets around the United States, including CBS News, Fox News, ABC News, and CNN. Mars released The Zodiac Mixtape (Limited Edition) LP through Mad Insanity on March 20, 2012. On June 17, 2014, Empire Distribution released his entire discography digitally, including new singles ‚ÄúHold On,‚Äù ‚ÄúHurt ‚ÄòEm,‚Äù and ‚ÄúOvernight Change.‚Äù In October 2015, Mars was asked to interview his favorite horror figures for a takeover of CBS Radio's website Man Cave Daily.

He released the single ‚ÄúCreatures of the Night,‚Äù featuring Tech N9ne and Twiztid, as his first physical record with Force 5. On July 28, 2017, he released his album Glockcoma. Mars also appeared on New York hardcore musician Danny Diablo's album The Crackson Heights Project, released to an overseas market through Eternal Sound Records, the international distributor for Force 5 Records.

In June 2019 Mad Insanity Records along with EMPIRE and Force 5 Records released the first single off of his album Locked Up A Broad called ‚ÄúThrow It All Away\\" immediately earning himself radio play in major markets erupting in a bidding with major labels in hopes to sign the artist. In the coming months Mad Insanity Records released an onslaught of singles including \\"Medication\\" which went on to win Single Of The Year at the 2019 Grrrd Awards. He kicked off a month long press run to promote the single appearing on podcasts based around the world including popular shows and website in America, Australia and Finland. Before the success of Medication died down he released a 10 track project called The Murder EP. The project was well received by fans and set the tone for what may be a new sound of his take on horrorcore. With songs like \\"Whiskey\\" getting cross over playlists ranging from hip-hop to hick-hop audiences the attention from a new markets, he answered with his full length album the following month with an all horrorcore theme with soft tones and sometimes acoustic sounds. \\"Locked Up A Broad\\" cemented his feet once again at the forefront of the horror rap counter culture.

On the morning of 27 January 1874 the East Coast Scotch express had been divided at Edinburgh and was due to pass the junction in two portions; the first bound for Glasgow at 07:02 and the second bound for Perth at 07:07, but were running some 8 minutes late. As soon as the Glasgow express passed, a goods train waiting in sidings at the junction was shunted across onto the main line, when the Perth express collided with it. It is believed that the station staff mistook the late-running Glasgow train for the second Perth express. Signals should have prevented the disaster but it is believed they were incorrectly set. Only when the roar of the approaching express could be heard were the signals were put back to danger, but it was too late to prevent the collision in which 16 were killed and 28 injured.

Staff Writer Orlando Sentinel (January 29, 2009)/ Mount Dora Ghost Walk targets Hispanic visitors theatrical and lantern guided walking tour of the city of Mount Dora, Florida. It is an adventure into the darker side of the city often referred by visitors as the New England of the South, and gets its inspiration from the local history, legends and myths that are compiled by a group of historians and actors. As an entertainment venue The Mount Dora Ghost Walk consists of live Victorian costumed actors giving a macabre theatrical interpretation that involves comedy, storytelling, improvisation and parlor magic, all of which is immediately followed by the full stage marionette theater performance that serves as the introductory platform launching the audience into the final walking tour. The outdoors tour itself, led by the same actors that performed during the indoors show, is the longest part of the venue and takes the participants through historical streets and inside landmark locations. The storyteller always stay in character while performing the interactive narration using props and other theatrical resources.

(October 30, 2008)Is Mount Dora haunted? Ghost-chasers investigate For its first 3 years of existence the enterprise operated exclusively from the Mount Dora Historical Society Old Jail Museum, but as its aim has grown considerably to also include full length theatrical productions, the show is now associated with the historical Lakeside Inn in Mount Dora. The Mount Dora Ghost Walk originality and unique approaches have been a staple for the entire Central Florida area, and its reputation as an entertainment venue has stimulated several other groups to try to copy the concept, but unfortunately with less success. The creators would like to see more venues like theirs spawning all around the area. According to one of its founders Andrew Mullen, their failure may be because \\"the others just wanted to do a spooky show, but we have created the entire Cracker Gothic concept, restored cemeteries, produced full theater, and no one will be able to surpass or even match that! We are the original ghost storytellers in Lake County!\\" History Although considered by many as a ghost tour or haunted attraction, The Mount Dora Ghost Walk can be more precisely defined as a theater experience very similar to the old and long gone ghost showsCarlson, Charlie(2005). \\"Weird Florida\\", p.98-100.

Staff Writers. Daily Commercial, Leesburg. (October 31, 2008) The \\"Haunts\\" of Lake County so having a venue such as a ghost tour was not a far-fetched idea, considering that up to the time the amount of haunted attractions was negligible outside of those provided by the region's theme parks. Both being avid amateur historians with unique artistic talents, but sharing a common passion for historical reenactment, acting and Gothic lore, their concept evolved into a very different direction that including innovative puppetry, magic, actors, Storytellers and a historical trail, is self proclaiming to be a new form of Southern Gothic for which De Leon created the name \\"Cracker Gothic\\" to make a clear distinction.

(October 5, 2008) \\"After more than 100 years, the Simpson House gets a new lease on life thanks to the Mount Dora Library Association and Mount Dora Historical Society\\" the two quickly allied to brainstorm potential ideas and one week later they had a complete full script and the marionette stage on its way. The plan was simply to create a group of mysterious ghostly characters along a story line based or inspired on the history of Mount Dora. After researching and writing the stories the decision was made to invite local volunteers willing to participate acting the theatrical vignettes along the route, providing the voices for the marionette theater sound track, helping with the logistics, or guiding the tours as storytellers. More than thirty people of all ages responded to this first call and within days a full cast was complete and scheduled for weekly rehearsals. Once the rehearsals finished, the historical museum transformed into a haunted version of a Freak Show, and the marionette program was finalized; the official inaugural date of The Mount Dora Ghost Walk was October 28, 2008, with three shows running nightly through November 1, 2008.Manis, Debbie.

Staff Writer. Daily Commercial, Leesburg. (October 22, 2009) / \\"Halloween Haunts\\" However, The Mount Dora ghost Walk continues as the only year around macabre show in their area, and the only one that has served as a platform to bring new entertainment options like the Cracker Gothic Acting Group producing dinner theater and parlor theater performances at the historical Lakeside Inn,  The Story Line  Most known ghost tours in the United States are guided excursions of the hosting city. More often than not they are just walking experiences although several well-known ones also use trolleys and even converted hearses to take their audience out. Some other tours combine special packages that may include dining, pub visits, or other specialized privileges like a visit to a more restricted location. As The Mount Dora Ghost Walk main objective is to educate people about the history of a city already well known for its tourist appeal, the creators had the challenge to offer not only a tour through a historical trail, but a solid venue that could be compared in reputation to the many festivals traditionally offered. For this purpose they had to be sure that their intended product could stand out over the many others through the nation, presents a novel format, attracts the interest of the general public, adheres to the traditions of the city, and most importantly, entertains. Perhaps the most important goal was the overall general acceptance from the other merchants and organizers of events, such as the Mount Dora Village Merchant's and Business Association.Benitez, Tom. Staff Photographer. Orlando Sentinel. (October 29, 2009) Photograph./ Zombie Attack After researching and visiting similar tours from Key West, Florida to Savannah, Georgia, the consensus was to create not just a tour, but a complete show culminating with the outdoors walk. It was agreed that guides wearing costumes and describing isolated legends was not enough, and that a much enduring approach that could create unforgettable memories was the way to go. After investigating the material compiled through their own work with the historical society, the creators wrote a storyline where every single haunted story converged on three mythical and fictional main characters through a very complex and twisted plot. These characters were to be the glue for all the other characters in the tour's stories, as they sustain their claims of either being involved with, or were responsible of each of the narrated events. The plot is based on the idea of a fantastical man made gateway, known as the Keyhole Vortex, that transports living humans and ghosts back and forth between historical periods and the beyond. This movement ends up creating a series of disruptions of a hypothetical reality continuum that is the cause of all the bizarre events in all of history, particularly the history of Mount Dora. This Keyhole Vortex is like a time machine that not only travels through time, but is also capable of crossing the barriers between the spiritual and real worlds. All the acting characters are essentially macabre human or ghostly travelers of this device, whom unfortunately are trapped inside the continuum of current day Mount Dora. As any good plot always has a villain, in this case all the chaotically and mysterious events described are because of the evil doings of a never seen mythical but historically inspired ghost known as Dr. Nutter. Having no other way to return to their respective realities, the main characters have to endure their imposed captivity guiding and educating people about the dangers of the Keyhole Vortex's macabre effects on history, hoping that in exchange they will receive clues about the whereabouts of the infamous Dr. Nutter and his malignant spawn Raspail. With this crazy convoluted story highlighted by jokes, puns, and other weirdness, the whole thing takes a live of its own and keeps feeding itself with new situations and characters that complicate the story even more. After all, and as Mullen, De Leon and Miller will gladly claim, \\"this weird storyline can be consider almost a hybrid mutated child between shows like science fiction's Doctor Who, The Time Tunnel, and The X-Files with comedy's Gilligan's Island, The Munsters, The Addams Family and Monty Python.\\"Dickinson, Joy Wallace. Staff Writer. Orlando Sentinel (May 31, 2009) \\"These ghost walks are a frightfully good time\\"  The stories  For a ghost tour to be successful it is necessary to have a well prepared set of interesting stories related to important locations, prominent people and remarkable events. Although the sources for these stories may be very variable, in general they are mostly based on true historical facts, legends, myths, or oral traditions. Researching historical facts can be measured even scientifically. But to define legend and myth there are more ambiguities of different types such a sociological, cultural, and religious among other. Although not everything that is part of folklore can be absolutely verifiable material, at least even the most bizarre of stories can be supported by saying that myth and legend are always based one something true.Tangherlini, \\"'It Happened Not Too Far from Here...': A Survey of Legend Theory and Characterization\\" Western Folklore 49.4 (October 1990:371-390) A definition of Legend states that \\"legends are tales that, because of the tie to a historical event or location, are believable, although not necessarily believed,\\"Wikipedia Article: Legend and according to Hippolyte Delehaye, legend \\"has, of necessity, some historical or topographical connection. It refers imaginary events to some real personage, or it localizes romantic stories in some definite spot.\\"Delehaye, P√®re Hippolyte. Bollandist, S.J., Translated By V. M. Crawford, (Reprinted University of Notre Dame Press 1961 With an Introduction By Richard J. Schoeck)/ \\"The Legends of the Saints: An Introduction to Hagiography\\" Since the first scripted version of The Mount Dora Ghost Walk, Mullen and De Leon made the firm resolution of utilizing the vast number of resources and references available to them from the Mount Dora Historical Society's and the Mount Dora Library's archives. They conducted numerous personal interviews to tap into the resource of oral traditions, and consulted several books considered rareEdgerton, David. Memories of Mount Dora and Lake County 1845 to 1981. Self published for the Mount Dora Public Library, circa 1983.Longstreet,R.J., \\"The Story of Mount Dora\\", Mount Dora Historical Society, 1960.Laux, James M. \\"Mount Dora, Florida: A short History.

The stories compiled ranged from the bizarre and ridiculous tall tales being told a local pubs, to the more well known historical original material. As it turned out, considering that there were numerous and very interesting stories to select from, the task was more difficult than they anticipated. Finally the decision was made to select and develop those stories along a centralized and easy to complete walking route. Having as the main objective a family friendly and memorable entertainment event, rather than a ghost hunting symposium, the team saw as appropriate to modify or adapt some of the stories that because of their content would have resulted too graphic or intense. They knew that this would detract many of the hard core ghost enthusiasts, but this was not considered as a problem because true paranormal research has been done behind curtains and the information is available on request.Ell, Larry. Staff Writer. Daily Commercial (September 24, 2009)./ Ghost Trackers look for evidence of paranormal activity in Mount Dora jail Among the stories presented during the show there are some that are part of the permanent repertoire and considered staples of Mount Dora's history. Other stories are included seasonally or alternated during special events, and some others are creative interpretations based on tales about a particular location or event. In general there is an average of 12 stories presented, with some of them enacted by the acting staff or the marionettes, while the rest are narrated during the tour. Each tour guide is a character of his own who has a particular narrative style that always delivers the performance according to his point of view and involvement with the plot. As they never have a predetermined schedule and the stories constantly change in relation to that character's mood, each tour can result in a completely different experience from the previous one, so in that way the audience will always have the chance of seeing something new. Perhaps the only exception is the plot performed by the marionettes, which is always a prerecorded play and necessary because of the logistical complexities involved in a puppetry show. The following is an example of some of the stories throughout their regular season: The Ghost of Fiddler's Pond: This is the oldest legend that has occurred within the city limits of today's Mount Dora. When it comes to historical, mystery, and romantic values, it is perhaps a true Mount Dora Gothic tale comparable to The Legend of Sleepy Hollow. The story is based on historical and folkloric elements that have been documented by different sources, including Edgerton's and Kennedy's books.Edgerton, David. Op. citKennedy, W.T. Op. cit Outside of the city of Mount Dora, by the intersection of Donnelly Street and State Road 441, exists a body of water named Fiddler's Pond. It is in reality a deep sink hole with a very steep bank, but which gives the appearance of a large pond. By the time the town settlement was on its way during the mid-1870s, early references already had named the body of water as Fiddler's Pond.Kennedy, W.T. Ibid. Although no specific evidence has been found yet about the origin of the name, Edgerton described in his book that the location was a frequently used watering stop for the animals pulling wagons into Mount Dora. As the story goes, a Mellonville (today's Sanford, Florida) merchant's wagon caravan suffered an accident losing all its cargo consisting of fiddle cases.Edgerton, David. Ibid. However, several folk tales about the place have described that the location got its name after an errant vagrant fiddler mysteriously disappeared only leaving his fiddle case, which was later found floating on the waters. It was assumed that the man drowned there leaving the place haunted. Some local residents have claimed witnessing apparitions that wander around the area late at night, or have heard some sad fiddle sounds coming from the orange groves that for more than hundred years have surrounded the pond. Gina Mamo and Kaiden Long originated the roles in fiddlers pond.  Storytelling  Another art form highly cultivated and promoted by the cast members is storytelling. The group of performers are carefully selected from those with a special talent for this narrative art.

The HD2 natively runs the Windows Mobile 6.5 operating system, and was released in Europe in November 2009, in Hong Kong in December 2009, and in other regions including North America in March 2010. The phone is the successor to the HTC Touch HD, and is succeeded by the HTC HD7.  History  Rumors of the HTC HD2 began appearing in September 2009. It was codenamed Leo, although a decal on the back cover conflictingly identified it as the Pro.Three (which indicates it may have been intended as a bridge between the HTC Touch Pro and HTC Touch), and the \\"About\\" info in Bluetooth as the HD2. The specifications sheet released turned out to be true when the HD2 was launched, with the exception of the listed 320MB of RAM, compared to the final 576MB (448MB available to user) of RAM.  Hardware  It is the first smartphone with a 4.3-inch touchscreen, the first Windows Mobile 6.5 phone with a multitouch capacitive screen and HTC Sense, and the second smartphone with a Qualcomm Snapdragon CPU (the first being the Toshiba TG01). The Snapdragon CPU is clocked at 1 GHz, but automatically underclocks itself to 553 MHz if extra processing power is not needed. Tweaks have been made however, to clock the processor dynamically from 96 MHz to 1.61 GHz. The HD2 is fitted with an Asahi Kasei AK8976A magnetometer. The magnetometer is used for applications such as the pre-loaded digital compass.  Accessories  HTC sold an optional capacitive stylus pen for the HD2 to aid navigation through the interface. Some Windows Mobile applications were designed to be used with a stylus, rather than finger-touch, and still need a stylus pen to be used effectively. An extended 'Media' battery was also available officially from HTC. The official unit comes with a replacement battery cover sporting a pull-out metal kickstand which supports the phone in an upright landscape orientation. The HD2 was sold with a black or brown leather slip-case with a velvet interior in certain countries.  Software  The HTC HD2 runs Windows Mobile 6.5 as its native operating system with Windows CE as its underlying kernel and OS. The HD2 runs HTC Sense as a UI shell on top of Windows Mobile.  Upgrades  The HD2 was originally slated to be upgraded to Windows Phone (then known as Windows Mobile 7). Microsoft rejected it and other Windows Mobile devices, however, due to it not being compliant with the company's hardware requirements for smartphones running Windows Phone, such as a lack of a dedicated two-stage camera button and five hardware buttons on the front as compared to the three supported. However, developers have successfully ported Windows Phone to the HD2. Microsoft has expressed tacit and subtle approval of such ports, nearing the release of Mango for native Windows Phone devices. Live services were not available to HD2 as the Windows Phone on the HD2 is not activated. It is possible for users to call Microsoft to request an activation key, but the device is not supported as a WP7 phone and being given a code is not guaranteed. Unlike its sibling, the HD Mini, the HD2 never received an official upgrade to Windows Mobile 6.5.3, the last stable release of Windows Mobile (the HD2 natively runs 6.5.0). However, several developers at XDA Developers prepared unofficial 6.5.3 and 6.5.5 (the latter being the last unstable release of Windows Mobile) ROMs for the HD2.  Modifications  The ability to 'mod' the HTC HD2 and run multiple different operating systems from the NAND flash or SD card has given it an enduring popularity, and this made the HTC HD2 one of the phones that could run the largest number of operating systems in the world. Android (versions 2.2 Froyo, 2.3 Gingerbread, 4.0.4 Ice Cream Sandwich, 4.1 Jelly Bean, 4.2 Jelly Bean, 4.3 Jellybean, 4.4 Kitkat, 5.0 Lollipop, 6.0 Marshmallow and 7.0 Nougat), Ubuntu, MeeGo and Windows Phone have all been unofficially ported to the HD2. In addition, many customised versions of Windows Mobile are available for the device, with versions 6.1, 6.5, 6.5.3 and 6.5.5 available. FPSECE (First PlayStation Emulator for Windows CE), a PlayStation emulator for Windows CE devices, was ported to the HD2 in December 2009, a few months after the initial release of the HD2. In early October 2010, a video was released that appeared to show a HD2 booting into Windows Phone by way of Russian developer Cotulla's MAGLDR tool (a bootloader), which was initially created to allow the booting of Android from the device's NAND flash.Windows Phone 7 on a HD2 As of 13 January 2011, MAGLDR and a Windows Phone 7 ROM are publicly available. Windows Phone Genuine checks prevent access to Windows Live services. A solution to this problem has been found, though the legality of the activation is still not fully known, and is frowned heavily upon by Microsoft. Windows Phone RTM (Release To Manufacturers) was ported to the HD2 in August 2011, a month after ROM developers at XDA Developers made a successful attempt to run a beta version on the device. On 23 December 2012, XDA developer zoid created a custom Debian/Ubuntu-based Pentest-focused distribution called ubnhd2 for the HTC HD2. In December 2012, Windows RT and Windows Phone 8 were ported onto the device as a proof-of-concept; no working builds exist.HTC HD2 proves itself a hacker's delight once again by running Windows RT On 6 May 2013, an XDA developer successfully ported Firefox OS to the HTC HD2. In August 2013, a group of developers on XDA successfully ported HTC Sense 5 to the HTC HD2. In November 2015, XDA Senior Member macs18max successfully ported Android 6.0 Marshmallow to the HTC HD2.http://forum.xda-developers.com/hd2-android/nand- dev/nov-17-2015-kernel-3-0-101-t3251438 In September 2016, CyanogenMod 14 which is based on Android 7.0 Nougat was ported to the HTC HD2 successfully.  Reception = Commercial reception  When launched in the UK, Vodafone quickly sold all of its stock and developed a backlog of orders, and O2 delayed putting the HD2 on its website so that it could fulfill all orders. Similarly, in the US, the HTC HD2 sold out in most T-Mobile stores within 4 hours and T-Mobile struggled to keep it in stock for several weeks. Certain T-Mobile locations ran a promotion that stated that iPhone users who traded in their handsets could get anywhere from $100 to $350 off the HD2. The HTC HD2 became notoriously difficult to get hold of in the UK and Europe. At one point, there was a high level of demand for the product amongst businesses, due to the fact that many have apps that operate solely on the Windows Mobile 6.5 operating system.

Hellmuth (1854‚Äì1944) was the first champion of what became the Canadian National Tennis Championship, now known as the Canadian Open or the Rogers Cup. He was also a three-time runner-up as well as one-time doubles champion. Born in Sherbrooke, Quebec in 1854, he was the son of Isaac Hellmuth, who became Bishop of Huron. After an early education at London, Ontario, he studied at Trinity College, Cambridge and trained for the English bar at the Inner Temple. Returning to Canada, he became a barrister at Toronto. He was a Life Bencher of the Law Society of Upper Canada. In 1880, he married Harriet Emily Gamble (b. 1847), granddaughter of Henry John Boulton. One of his junior partners, John Meredith (who was to die in WWI), son of Sir William Ralph Meredith, married his daughter, Miriam (b:16 Feb 1881). Their daughter Diana (b. Feb 1910) was married to Marcel Provost () then Edward Curtis. In 1874, Hellmuth may have built a court at 148 Front Street, which was the future site of the Toronto Lawn Tennis Club that was founded in 1876. Though not an original member, Hellmuth joined the club soon after returning to Canada around 1879. He was runner-up at an unofficial United States national tennis championship in 1880, before winning the inaugural tournament played in 1881 at the Toronto Lawn Tennis Club, by defeating W.H. Young, also of Canada, 6‚Äì2, 6‚Äì2. The following year, Hellmuth lost the final to compatriot Harry D. Gamble, 2‚Äì6, 3‚Äì6, 2‚Äì6. After a two-year hiatus, Hellmuth lost in consecutive finals in 1885 and 1886, the first to American J.S. Clark 3‚Äì6, 6‚Äì3, 1‚Äì6, 2‚Äì6 and the second to his compatriot and childhood friend, C.S. Hyman, in the first of his four consecutive championships, 4‚Äì6, 4‚Äì6, 6‚Äì1, 6‚Äì4, 4‚Äì6. That year Hellmuth and Hyman also teamed to capture the doubles title. Hellmuth also founded the London Lawn Tennis Club in 1881. He was an inaugural inductee into the Tennis Canada Hall of Fame, in 1991. He died in 1944, at his home, Allandale House, Toronto.

Eoin Gallda MacDubhghaill,MacDonald (2013). E√≤in Gallda MacDubhghaill,Bateman; McLeod (2007). and E√≥in Gallda Mac Dubhghaill,Coira (2008); McLeod (2005). was fourteenth-century Scottish magnate. He was a grandson of John MacDougall, Lord of Argyll, a man who had been forced from Scotland into exile in the first third of the century. It was under John Gallda that the MacDougall leadership made its resurgence in Scotland after generations of English exile. By the mid century, John Gallda was married to Johanna Isaac, a niece of David II, King of Scotland, and restored to a portion of the MacDougalls' originally holdings in Argyll. The favours bestowed upon the MacDougalls by the Scottish Crown appear to have been a tactic to keep in check nearby magnates, such as John MacDonald, Lord of the Isles, a man who headed the MacDougalls' regional rivals, the MacDonalds. Although John Galla enjoyed close ties to the Bruce regime, with the subsequent accession of Robert II, King of Scotland, and the start of the Stewart regime, the MacDougalls quickly fell from favour. John Gallda was the last MacDougall to hold the lordship of Lorne. He and Johanna had two legitimate daughters through which the lordship passed, whilst the leadership of MacDougalls passed to an illegitimate son. Familial background Coat of arms of the Lord of Argyll as it appears in the fourteenth-century Balliol Roll.Campbell of Airds (2014) p. 204; McAndrew (2006) p. 66; McAndrew (1999) p. 693 ¬ß 1328; McAndrew (1992); The Balliol Roll (n.d.). It corresponds to the seal of John Gallda's great-grandfather, Alexander MacDougall, Lord of Argyll.Campbell of Airds (2014) p. 204; McAndrew (2006) p. 66; McAndrew (1999) p. 693 ¬ß 1328; McAndrew (1992). John Gallda was a son of Allan MacDougall of Argyll (fl. 1319), who was in turn a son of John MacDougall, Lord of Argyll (died 1316).Boardman, S (2006) p. 65; Sellar (2003); Boardman, S (2000) p. 221 tab. iv; Sellar (2000) pp. 194 tab. ii, 209 tab. iii. The epithet gallda can be taken to mean \\"the foreigner\\",Penman (2014) p. 80; MacDonald (2013) p. 48; Boardman, S (2006) p. 65; Sellar (2003); Sellar (2000) p. 217. \\"Anglicised\\", or \\"Lowlandised\\".Bateman; McLeod (2007) p. xxiii; McLeod (2005). Gallda was not an unheard of epithet, and was apparently accorded to people who were fluent in the Scots or English languages,Bateman; McLeod (2007) p. xxiii; McLeod (2005). or to people who had spent time in either England,Bateman; McLeod (2007) p. xxiii. or non-Gaelic speaking areas of Scotland.Coira (2008) p. 141. John Gallda's aforesaid grandfather, John MacDougall, had been closely connected with the Comyns, and therefore had been a constant opponent of Robert I, King of Scotland, and an ally of the latter's English counterparts, Edward I, King of England and Edward II, King of England. Following his defeat to Robert I at the Battle of the Pass of Brander, John MacDougall fled to England where he spent the remainder of his life in the service of the English Crown. He left at least two sons and two daughters.Sellar (2004). Both of his sons, Ewen and the aforesaid Allan MacDougall of Argyll, were members of Edward II's royal household.Boardman, S (2006) p. 65; Sellar (2004); Sellar (2000) pp. 194 tab. ii, 209 tab. iii, 213, 217, 217 n. 152; Macphail (1916) p. 148, 148 n. 1; Bain (1888) pp. 488-489 ¬ß 5; Bain (1887) pp. lxiv-lxv, 122 ¬ß 647, 130 ¬ß 684, 132 ¬ß 699, 132-133 ¬ß 701; Bain (1884) pp. 490-491 ¬ß 1830; Simpson; Galbraith (n.d.) pp. 197-198 ¬ß 471, 198-205 ¬ß 472, 231 ¬ß 562. After his death in 1329, Robert I was succeeded by his young son, David II, King of Scotland (died 1371). The kingdom soon came under the attack of Edward Balliol (died 1364), an English-backed claimant to the throne,Boardman, SI (2006); Webster (2004). and the young David II was forced to flee to France for safety. In time, English-backed Balliol regime diminished to the extent that the teenage David II was able to return to his realm in 1341.Webster (2004); Boardman, S (2001a). Five years later, however, David II was captured by the English in a disastrous military campaign, and held in custody before his eventual ransom in 1357.Boardman, SI (2006); Boardman, S (2001a). John Gallda himself was brought up in England, due to the exile of his father and grandfather, and it is likely David II's own captivity there that brought about their eventual association.Boardman, S (2000) p. 232 n. 64. Relocation Nineteenth-century facsimile of a charter of John Gallda to his father's sister, Mary, wife of John of Stirling.Fraser (1858) pp. 198-199. John Gallda granted the charter in 1338, whilst in the service of the English, during the occupation of Perth. John Gallda's grandfather died in 1316.Boardman, S (2006) p. 65; Sellar (2000) p. 217. The history of the MacDougalls in years immediately after his death is obscure. The ancestral lands had been forfeited by Robert I, with the dismantled lordship distributed piecemeal to supporters of the new Bruce regime, such the MacDonalds, Campbells, and MacLeans.Daniels (2013) p. 26; Boardman, S (2006) p. 39. Despite the MacDougalls' extended exile, there is evidence that the kindred managed to maintain influence in the ecclesiastical affairs of their former lands, as the Bishop of Argyll in 1342-1362 appears to have been a MacDougall.MacDonald (2013) pp. 48, 147-148, 148 n. 193; Boardman, S (2006) pp. 65, 89 n. 63. In the 1330s, during the English-backed Balliol invasions of Scotland, the MacDougalls appear to have attempted a comeback. For example, a certain Ewen, perhaps John Gallda's aforesaid uncle, was apparently active on the island of Lismore in 1334.Boardman, S (2006) p. 65; Sellar (2000) p. 217 n. 158; Turner (1998) pp. 650-651; Paul (1882) pp. 670-671 ¬ß 3136; Origines Parochiales Scotiae (1855) p. 828. John Gallda is recorded in Scotland as early as 1338, when as a member of the English garrison in Perth he issued a grant of lands to his father's sister, Mary, wife of John Stirling.MacDonald (2013) p. 48; Boardman, S (2006) p. 65; Sellar (2004); Turner (1998) p. 651; Fraser (1858) p. 198. The following year, the Scots, under the command of Robert Stewart, Steward of Scotland (died 1390), overcame the English at Perth. John Gallda does not appear on record again until the 1350s, and it is possible that he was one of the men under Thomas Ughtred (died 1365), commander of the English forces at Perth, who were allowed to return to England following the Steward's successful siege.Boardman, S (2006) pp. 65, 69 n. 65, 86-87 n. 32. Seal of Edward Balliol as King of Scotland.Birch (1905) pp. 46-48, 147 pl. 26. A few years earlier prior, in the mid 1330s, during the brief Balliol regime, the Hebridean magnate John MacDonald of Islay (died c. 1387) ceased to support the exiled David II, proceeded to style himself Lord of the Isles, and shifted his allegiance to Edward Balliol and the latter's English overlord.Cameron (2014) p. 154; Penman (2014) pp. 75-76; Oram (2004) pp. 123-124. During this time, Edward Balliol rapidly granted away lands of stubborn Bruce supporters to loyal supporters of his own.Penman (2014) pp. 75-76; Webster (2004). In so doing, large swathes of Argyll were gifted away to the Lord of the Isles. Specifically, the islands of Colonsay, Gigha, Islay, (half of) Jura, Lewis, Mull, Skye, and the mainland territories of Ardnamurchan, Kintyre, Knapdale, and Morvern were assigned to him.Boardman, S (2006) pp. 60, 86 n. 31, 86-87 n. 32; MacDonald; MacDonald (1896) pp. 496-497; Bain (1887) pp. 213-214 ¬ß 1182; Rymer; Holmes (1740) pt. 3 p. 152. These grants, therefore, included regions formerly held by the MacDougalls and MacRuairidhs,Boardman, S (2006) p. 86 n. 31. which in turn could indicate that it was understood between the Lord of the Isles and the Balliol regime that the MacDougalls were to be denied royal support in reclaiming their former lands.Penman (2014) p. 76. However, territories such as Appin, Benderloch, Lismore, and Lorne itself, were omitted from John MacDonald's grants, possibly as a result of John Gallda's aforesaid campaigning at Perth, in the service of the English-Balliol cause.Boardman, S (2006) pp. 86-87 n. 32. David II, King of Scotland.Birch (1905) pp. 43-45, 145 pl. 25. It seems that John Gallda relocated to Scotland at some point in the early 1350s,Caldwell (2008) p. 53; Penman (2005) p. 206. for he next appears on record in 1354, when he and the aforesaid Lord of the Isles, a man who headed the MacDougalls' traditional rivals the MacDonalds, signed a bond of peace between each other. The contract made it clear that John Gallda recognised John MacDonald's dominance in the region, and also the latter's control of former MacDougall lands lost in the reign of David II's father. Additionally, the Lord of the Isles granted John Gallda the island of Coll, and part of Tiree. The fact that John Gallda was to hand over three hostages until the castle of Cairn na Burgh M√≥r was in John MacDonald's possession suggests that at least one of the fortresses in the contested lands was then in the hands of the MacDougalls.Penman (2014) p. 81; Boardman, S (2012) p. 241 n. 39; Caldwell (2008) p. 53; Boardman, S (2006) pp. 65-66; Fisher (2005) p. 94; Campbell of Airds (2000) pp. 86-87; Turner (1998) p. 651; Johnston (1991) p. 21; Munro (1981) p. 24; Macphail (1914) pp. 75-78; MacDonald; MacDonald (1900) pp. 745-746. The fact that both John MacDonald and John Gallda were Balliol supporters in the 1330s could be evidence that this MacDonald-MacDougall pact, and the division of territories wherein, was based upon an understanding established during the Balliol regime.Boardman, S (2006) pp. 86-87 n. 32. Whatever the case, a similar contract was concluded between John Gallda and Archibald Campbell, Lord of Loch Awe (died 1385√ó1387) the following year.Boardman, S (2006) p. 66. Restoration Dunstaffnage Castle, a fortress built, held, and lost by John Gallda's MacDougall predecessors appears to have been one of several castles regained by John Gallda as a consequence of the restoration of the family's former lands in Lorne.Campbell of Airds (2000) p. 97. The impetus behind the aforesaid agreements appears to have been the prospect of the MacDougalls eventual restoration in their ancestral lands. By concluding these contracts, the MacDonalds and Campbells appear to have attempted to preserve their own possession of former MacDougall territories. The prospect of a MacDougall comeback may have seemed threatening in the wake of the ongoing negotiations to secure the release of David II.Boardman, S (2006) p. 66. The king finally secured his release in 1357,Boardman, S (2006) p. 66. and about the following year granted John Gallda all the possessions and rents that had formerly belonged to the latter's great-grandfather, Alexander MacDougall, Lord of Argyll (died 1310). Furthermore, the king granted John Gallda certain fortresses in the possession of the Lord of the Isles,Penman (2014) p. 80; MacDonald (2013) p. 48 n. 136; Boardman, S (2006) p. 67; Boardman, SI (2005) pp. 127, 150 n. 5; Penman (2005) p. 206; Thomson (1912) p. 592 ¬ß 1182; Robertson (1798) p. 30 ¬ß 2. a gift that could refer to the castles outlined in the aforesaid agreement of 1354, and therefore evidencing the MacDougall's restoration on Mull and other island territories.Boardman, S (2006) pp. 89-90 nn. 71-72. The king's grant of 1357/1358 effectively nullified his own father's grants of Lorne and Benderloch lands to the Campbells,Boardman, S (2006) p. 67; Boardman, SI (2005) p. 150 n. 5. and overturned the aforesaid MacDonald-MacDougall pact of 1354.Boardman, S (2006) p. 67; Penman (2005) p. 206. It is apparent that John Gallda was favoured by David II. The two may well have first met in England during the king's captivity,Boardman, S (2006) p. 66; Boardman, S (2000) p. 232 n. 64. and the king may well have been responsible for his relocation to Scotland in the early 1350s.Penman (2014) p. 80; Boardman, SI (2005) p. 127; Penman (2005) p. 206. It is almost certain that David II was also responsible for John Gallda's fortuitous marriage to Johanna Isaac, daughter of the king's own sister, Matilda Bruce.Sellar (2004); Penman (2014) p. 80; Boardman, S (2000) pp. 221 tab. iv, 232; Sellar (2000) p. 218. The union itself is datable to at least 1362,Boardman, SI (2005) p. 127; Boardman, S (2000) p. 232 n. 64; Burnett (1878) p. 106. and resulted in the king regarding John Gallda as a nephew.Boardman, SI (2005) p. 127; Burnett (1878) p. 106. In theory the marriage meant that any children of the couple potentially possessed a claim in the royal succession,Penman (2014) p. 81; Penman (2005) p. 207; Boardman, S (2000) p. 232. and may have been regarded as a threat to the leading claimant, and eventual successor, the aforesaid Robert Stewart, David II's nephew.Boardman, SI (2005) pp. 127-128; Boardman, S (2000) pp. 110 n. 2, 232. In fact, the king elsewhere appears to have attempted to divert the royal succession on several occasions,Boardman, S (2000) p. 232. and contemporary royal acta reveal that he bestowed much favour upon John Gallda and Johanna.Penman (2005) p. 206 n. 40; Boardman, S (2000) p. 232; Thomson (1912) p. 78 ¬ß 237; Burnett (1878) pp. 106, 114, 173. Edward III, King of England (right) as pictured in the fourteenth-century British Library Cotton MS Nero D VI.Penman (2005) pl. 8; Edward III and David II of Scotland ... (n.d.). John Gallda's royal support and relocation appears to have been due to the fact that David II regarded him as a potential ally against the machinations of the aforesaid Robert Stewart, and the latter's western confederates.Boardman, SI (2005) p. 127. By the end of the 1350s, John MacDonald, one such confederate, was not only an ally to Edward Balliol,Penman (2005) p. 206. and Edward III,Penman (2005) p. 206; Boardman, SI (2005) p. 127. but allied in marriage to the Steward besides.Penman (2005) p. 206. As for John Gallda, however, he had no links with the Steward,Boardman, S (2006) p. 66. and the Scottish Crown may have consequently considered the MacDougall as a reliable means to fill the western power vacuum created by the murder of Ranald MacRuairi (died 1346).Penman (2005) p. 206. John MacDonald's alignment with the king's adversaries at this point suggests that the castles referred to in John Gallda's aforesaid royal charter may have included the island fortresses outlined in the MacDonald-MacDougall pact of 1354.Boardman, S (2006) pp. 89-90 n. 72. Although John Galla's restoration allowed the MacDougalls to regain a foothold in their traditional lands, the phenomenal power possessed by their predecessors was never regained.Boardman, S (2006) pp. 67-68; Sellar (2004); Sellar (2000) p. 217. Originally in his pact with John MacDonald, John Gallda styled himself \\"of Argyll\\", perhaps in imitation of his powerful predecessors. Afterwards, he used the style \\"of Lorn\\", seemingly in acceptance of his family's restricted place in society.Boardman, S (2006) pp. 66, 90 n. 76, 99, 112 n. 28; Boardman, SI (2005) p. 127. The fact that he was able to succeed in Argyll at all, after almost a forty years of his family's absence, reveals not only the strength of family-loyalties, but also the apparent resentment of MacDonald encroachment and overlordship.Penman (2014) p. 81. In 1355, John Gallda concluded a bond of protection to Gilbert, Lord of Glassary who was locked in dispute with the Campbells of Ardscotnish.Boardman, S (2006) pp. 68-69; Campbell of Airds (2000) p. 85; Macphail (1916) pp. 142-143 ¬ß 11. The possibility that the father of John Campbell, Lord of Ardscotnish had received a grant of former MacDougall territories in the reign of Robert I may explain the MacDougall's interest in the dispute.Boardman, S (2006) p. 69. By the end of the 1350s, the borders of the MacDougall and Campbell lands appears to have been amicably settled, and the families bound themselves together through the marriage of Archibald's son and successor to an apparent kinswoman of John Gallda.Boardman, S (2006) pp. 67-68, 90 n. 75. Alienation Laing (1878) pl. 63; Sir David Lindsay's Armorial (n.d.). Although the MacDougalls clearly had the support of the kingdom in the wake of John Gallda's return and consolidation of core territories, by the 1360s the relationship appears to have soured somewhat. Unlike Robert I, who had lent personal support to his western allies, David II left the MacDougalls to deal with the surrounding MacDonalds themselves.Penman (2005) p. 207. In 1365, John Gallda was remarkably one of fifteen magnates and clerics summoned by the Scottish Crown to work out a peace deal with the English.Boardman, S (2006) pp. 247-248; Penman (2005) pp. 338-339; 1365/7/3 (n.d.). John Gallda's presence there, as with that of Archibald Campbell of Loch Awe, may be explained by the fact that one of the proposed concessions to the English was to make west-coast Scots liable to be drafted into English military service in Ireland. From the point of view of the Scottish Crown, such a concession may have been intended to deal with troublesome western magnates.Boardman, S (2012) pp. 247-248, 248 n. 55; Penman (2005) p. 339. In 1366, the parliament attempted to tackle the ongoing issue of widespread violence across the realm.Penman (2005) pp. 352-353. John Gallda and John MacDonald were two magnates noted for being \\"contumaciously absent\\".Cameron (2014) p. 156; Penman (2005) p. 353; 1366/7/1 (n.d.). Certainly the MacDougalls and MacDonalds were long-time rivals, however the absence of the two men may well have been due to the prospect of the aforesaid military service, or by the reassessment of their taxes that year, for it was later recorded that John Gallda had refused to allow royal officials review his Argyllshire lands.Penman (2005) p. 353; 1366/7/18 (n.d.). John Gallda was again called to parliament in 1369.Penman (2005) p. 380; 1369/3/4 (n.d.). As with the aforesaid assembly, the violence and tax avoidance in the Highlands and Islands appears to have been the main point of business, and one of the magnates singled out for oaths of obedience was John Gallda himself.Duncan (1998) pp. 267-268; Penman (2005) pp. 380-381; 1369/3/5 (n.d.).

In the aftermath of the 1369 parliament, the Scottish Crown gifted the expansive lordship of Glen Lyon to John Gallda.Boardman, S (2006) p. 110 n. 3; Penman (2005) p. 382; Thomson (1912) p. 78 ¬ß 237. He further received the bailliary of Appin of Dull.Boardman, S (2006) p. 110 n. 3; Boardman, SI (2005) p. 127; Penman (2005) p. 382; Burnett (1878) p. 352. These endowments may well have been an attempt by the Scottish Crown to win back the support of John Gallda as a means to counter the latter's powerful neighbours, the aforesaid Steward, Earl of Ross, and Lord of the Isles. At about this time, David II appears to attempted the same thing with the aforesaid Lord of Loch Awe.Penman (2005) p. 382. Death and descendants Robert II, King of Scotland.Birch (1905) pp. 48-50, 153 pl. 29. David II died in 1371,Boardman, S (2006) p. 94; Boardman, S (2001a); Boardman, S (2001b). and was succeeded by the now fifty-four year-old Steward (as Robert II).Boardman, S (2001b). In an instant the latter's allies and followers became \\"king's men\\"; and whilst these men may well have regarded their futures as promising, the futures of those who had been adversaries of the Steward may have seemed bleak in comparison.Boardman, S (2006) p. 94. Clearly John Gallda's close connection with David II, and his wife's royal Bruce ancestry, would have done little to endear the MacDougalls to the newly inaugurated Stewart monarch.Boardman, S (2006) p. 94; Boardman, SI (2005) pp. 127-128. Unsurprisingly, whilst Archibald Campbell was present at Robert II's royal coronation, John Gallda was notably absent.Boardman, SI (2005) p. 128. In fact, Robert II quickly revoked the aforesaid lands and positions in Perthshire that John Galla had received from David II, and subsequently gifted them to his own sons.Boardman, S (2006) pp. 94-95. The animosity directed at the MacDougalls by the new Stewart regime may well be perceptible in the harsh depiction of John Gallda's aforesaid grandfather in The Bruce, an epic poem composed for the Stewart royal court by John Barbour (died 1395).Boardman, S (2007) pp. 105-106; Boardman, S (2006) pp. 95, 110 n. 5; Boardman, SI (2005) p. 128. One of the sub-themes of The Bruce is a bitter feud between Robert I and John MacDougall, a motif which appears to harken to the uneasy relations between Robert II and John Gallda.Boardman, S (2007) pp. 105-106, 105 nn. 65-66; Boardman, SI (2005) pp. 128, 151 n. 29. In a similar way, the positive roles of the ancestors of John MacDonald and Archibald Campbell are seemingly inflated, and greatly influenced by the political realities of the late fourteenth century Stewart regime.Boardman, S (2007) pp. 105-106, 105 nn. 65-66. John Gallda died between 1371√ó1377.Caldwell (2008) p. 54; McAndrew (2006) p. 66; Boardman, S (2000) pp. 221 tab. iv, 231. Although the MacDougalls had clearly been out of favour of the king, the ultimate failure of the family was John Gallda's inability to produce a legitimate male heir to succeed him in the lordship.Boardman, S (2006) p. 95. According to Gesta Annalia II, John Gallda and Johanna indeed had a son, or sons,Boardman, S (2006) p. 110 n. 6; Skene (1872) p. 360; Skene (1871) pp. 369, 369-370 n. 17. but they certainly never succeeded their father, and evidently died young.Boardman, S (2006) p. 110 nn. 6-7. What is certain, however, is that the couple had two daughters: Isabel (died 1439) and Janet.McAndrew (2006) p. 66; Sellar (2004); Boardman, S (2000) pp. 221 tab. iv, 231-232; Turner (1998) p. 651. At an uncertain date,Boardman, S (2006) p. 110 n. 7. Isabel married John Stewart of Innermeath (died 1421), whilst Janet married John Stewart's brother, Robert Stewart of Durisdeer (died 1403).Sellar (2004); Boardman, S (2000) p. 221 tab. iv, 232. The brothers were members of the Stewarts of Innermeath, a cadet branch of the Stewart family, and by 1388 they brought forth claims to the lordship of Lorne through their wives.Boardman, S (2006) pp. 95-96. Eventually the lordship passed to Isabel's husband, and this couple's descendants.Caldwell (2008) p. 54; Sellar (2004). According to Gesta Annalia II, after John Gallda's death Johanna married Malcolm Fleming of Biggar, a union which appears to be corroborated by a papal dispensation granted in 1377.Boardman, S (2000) p. 231 n. 60, 232; Skene (1871) p. 369-370 n. 17; Theiner (1864) p. 362 ¬ß 724. In consequence of the marriages of John Gallda's daughters and widow, Robert II oversaw the neutralisation of potentially threatening competing claims to the royal succession.Boardman, S (2000) p. 232. Ruinous Achanduin Castle, on the island of Lismore, was built by John Gallda's MacDougall predecessors. There is reason to suspect that it remained in the hands of the family throughout the fourteenth century.Turner (1998). With the demise of the Lord of Lorn, the leadership of the MacDougalls appears to have fallen to Allan MacDougall,Boardman, S (2006) p. 95; Boardman, S (2000) p. 231. John Gallda's apparently illegitimate son,Boardman, S (2006) p. 95; Boardman, S (2000) pp. 231-232; Sellar (2000) pp. 217-218; Turner (1998) p. 651. and ancestor of later MacDougalls of Dunollie.Sellar (2004); Boardman, S (2000) pp. 221 tab. iv, 231; Sellar (2000) pp. 217-218. The Stewarts of Innermeath were not the only family to lay claim to MacDougall possessions. One such family were the MacArthur Campbells of Strachur, who assigned their own claims to certain former MacDougall territories in Lorne to Duncan, Earl of Lennox (died 1425), a son-in-law of the aforesaid Lord of Loch Awe. This formidable Campbell-Lennox pact would have likely been regarded as a perilous threat to both the MacDougalls and Stewarts who claimed to be the rightful heirs of John Gallda. At its height, the coalition appears to have included (Robert II's son) Robert Stewart, Earl of Fife and Menteith (died 1420) and Alexander MacDonald, Lord of Lochaber.Boardman, S (2006) pp. 95-98. In time, however, the Stewarts of Innermeath successfully consolidated their own control in the region, and appear to have come to terms with Allan, whose grandson, John Ciar MacDougall of Dunollie, held considerable possessions and positions under their new Stewart overlords.Boardman, S (2006) pp. 98-99; Boardman, S (2000) pp. 232-233.

They were discovered by mathematician Michael Somos. From the form of their defining recurrence (which involves division), one would expect the terms of the sequence to be fractions, but nevertheless many Somos sequences have the property that all of their members are integers. Recurrence equations For an integer number k larger than 1, the Somos-k sequence (a_0, a_1, a_2, \\\\ldots ) is defined by the equation :a_n a_{n-k} = a_{n-1} a_{n-k+1} + a_{n-2} a_{n-k+2} + \\\\cdots + a_{n-(k-1)/2} a_{n-(k+1)/2} when k is odd, or by the analogous equation :a_n a_{n-k} = a_{n-1} a_{n-k+1} + a_{n-2} a_{n-k+2} + \\\\cdots + (a_{n-k/2})^2 when k is even, together with the initial values : ai = 1 for i < k. For k = 2 or 3, these recursions are very simple (there is no addition on the right-hand side) and they define the all-ones sequence (1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, ...). In the first nontrivial case, k = 4, the defining equation is :a_n a_{n-4} = a_{n-1} a_{n-3} + a_{n-2}^2 while for k = 5 the equation is :a_n a_{n-5} = a_{n-1} a_{n-4} + a_{n-2} a_{n-3}\\\\,. These equations can be rearranged into the form of a recurrence relation, in which the value an on the left hand side of the recurrence is defined by a formula on the right hand side, by dividing the formula by an ‚àí k. For k = 4, this yields the recurrence :a_n = \\\\frac{a_{n-1} a_{n-3} + a_{n-2}^2}{a_{n-4}} while for k = 5 it gives the recurrence :a_n = \\\\frac{a_{n-1} a_{n-4} + a_{n-2} a_{n-3}}{a_{n-5}}. While in the usual definition of the Somos sequences, the values of ai for i < k are all set equal to 1, it is also possible to define other sequences by using the same recurrences with different initial values. Sequence values The values in the Somos-4 sequence are :1, 1, 1, 1, 2, 3, 7, 23, 59, 314, 1529, 8209, 83313, 620297, 7869898, ... . The values in the Somos-5 sequence are :1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 2, 3, 5, 11, 37, 83, 274, 1217, 6161, 22833, 165713, ... . The values in the Somos-6 sequence are :1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 3, 5, 9, 23, 75, 421, 1103, 5047, 41783, 281527, ... . The values in the Somos-7 sequence are :1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 3, 5, 9, 17, 41, 137, 769, 1925, 7203, 34081, ... . Integrality The form of the recurrences describing the Somos sequences involves divisions, making it appear likely that the sequences defined by these recurrence will contain fractional values. Nevertheless, for k ‚â§ 7 the Somos sequences contain only integer values. Several mathematicians have studied the problem of proving and explaining this integer property of the Somos sequences; it is closely related to the combinatorics of cluster algebras.... For k ‚â• 8 the analogously defined sequences eventually contain fractional values. For k < 7, changing the initial values (but using the same recurrence relation) also typically results in fractional values.

In the 19th century, the plantation provided a key stopover along the Walton Road, an early stagecoach road connecting Knoxville and Nashville, and in 1854 served as a temporary county seat for the newly formed Putnam County. In 2009, the house was added to the National Register of Historic Places. The White Plains plantation was established in 1809 by William Quarles (1752-1814), a Revolutionary War veteran who had migrated to the area from Virginia. Quarles' grandson, Stephan Decatur Burton (1813-1892), built the White Plains house sometime around 1848, and in the late 1950s Harvey Draper bought the house and made numerous renovations. Location White Plains is located on the eastern Highland Rim, a plateau- like upland between the higher Cumberland Plateau to the east and the lower Nashville Basin to the west. The western escarpments of the Cumberland Plateau, known locally as \\"Algood Mountain\\" and \\"Buck Mountain,\\" rise about a mile to the east. The house stands along Old Walton Road just outside the municipal boundary of Algood.U.S. Census Bureau, American FactFinder Reference Map for Algood, Tennessee. Retrieved: 2009-10-06. History THC marker along Old Walton Road What is now White Plains was part of Cherokee lands ceded to the United States with the signing of the Third Treaty of Tellico in 1805. The Walton Road, a stagecoach road completed in 1801 connecting Knoxville and Nashville, brought the earliest permanent legal settlers to the Upper Cumberland region.Calvin Dickenson, Legacy:Author of New Book on Walton Road Explores Its Influence on the U.C. Economy. Upper Cumberland Business Journal, 9 August 2007. Retrieved: 2009-10-01. Around 1804, an early pioneer named Daniel Alexander established an inn along the Walton Road at what is now White Plains. In 1808, Alexander sold the inn and land to William Quarles, a lawyer and Revolutionary War veteran from Bedford County, Virginia. Quarles moved his family, belongings, and thirty slaves to the new land in December 1809. According to family tradition, Quarles named the land \\"White Plains,\\" as the waves of prairie grass appeared white in the winter sunlight as Quarles looked out over the land from the edge of the Cumberland Plateau.Mary Jean DeLozier, Putnam County, Tennessee, 1850‚Äì1970 (Cookeville, Tenn.: 1979), pp. 12-14. House at White Plains, originally built in 1848 and remodeled in 1958 Shortly after his arrival, Quarles built a two-story log house with a detached kitchen and office, and several slave cabins. Within a few years, Quarles had established a general store, blacksmith shop, and post office at White Plains. The Kentucky Stock Road, a cattle drovers' path connecting Huntsville, Alabama and Danville, Kentucky, was developed in subsequent years and intersected the Walton Road at White Plains. The Quarles' inn was a popular stopover for travellers along these two roads, and three U.S. presidents-- Andrew Jackson, James K. Polk, and Andrew Johnson-- are known to have lodged at White Plains. Quarles's youngest son, John Adams Quarles (1802-1876), may have inspired author Mark Twain's story, \\"The Jumping Frog of Calaveras County\\" (John Quarles was married to Twain's aunt, Martha Lampton). Quarles's daughter, Sallie, was married to U.S. Congressman Adam Huntsman, famous in Tennessee history for defeating Davy Crockett in the 1834 election and prompting Crockett's angry departure to Texas. On April 2, 1814, William P. Quarles was murdered by a man named William Phillips. His wife, Ann Hawes Quarles, continued to manage White Plains until her death in 1844, when the land passed to Stephen Decatur Burton (1813-1892), a grandson of William and Ann. Burton built the present house at White Plains in 1848, and built a two-story schoolhouse for the small community's children. Largely through inheritance, Burton was one of the Upper Cumberland's largest slaveholders, owning around 100 slaves at the outbreak of the Civil War in 1861. During the war, Burton lost the bulk of his fortune when Union forces burned several warehouses in Chattanooga, where Burton had amassed $125,000 worth of cotton. In the latter half of the 19th century, the community around White Plains disintegrated, although the house and farm remained in the hands of the Quarles-Burton family. The family eventually sold the house to Harvey Draper, who remodeled the house in the late 1950s. In 2018, the City of Algood purchased White Plains with plans to turn it into a museum.http://herald- citizen.com/stories/algood-to-buy-white-plains,27284 House and outbuildings Smokehouse, now a log cabin (left) and corn crib (right) at White Plains The house at White Plains was originally constructed in 1848 by Stephen Decatur Burton after the loghouse built by his grandfather William Quarles burned. The house originally consisted of a hewn log frame with weatherboard siding, built around a central floor plan. Two by rooms flank both sides of the central hallway on the first floor, and the second floor consists of four by . A sitting room was added to the rear of the house in 1925. The 1958 renovations included the addition of a brick exterior, a front portico, and two single-story wings containing a kitchen and several bedrooms. The interior of the house originally consisted of poplar floors, although the poplar floor on the first story was covered with hardwood in 1958. The original rooms all had a fireplace, each with a unique mantel. A \\"dog-leg\\" staircase accesses the second story. The first-story hallway has built-in gun cabinets and a 19th-century pier mirror (the latter added in 1958). Outbuildings at White Plains include a smokehouse, corn crib, and horse barn. The smokehouse, built with dovetail-notched logs around 1860, was remodeled as a log cabin in 1990. The corn crib, a log structure built around 1860, was moved from its original location around 1950, and now sits partially collapsed next to the smokehouse. The horse barn is a modern structure built around 2000, with wooden walls and a metal roof. The Quarles and Burton family cemeteries are located opposite the junction of Old Walton Road and Deck Mountain Road, a few blocks from the house.

Friends of Bank Hall In 2011, the Bank Hall Action Group needed to achieve charity status to enable the restoration project to continue to the next level due to the campaign progression. From 2012 the Bank Hall Action Group will run alongside the new charity group and will gradually be phased out and all work, events and plans will be managed by the Friends of Bank Hall. As of May 2012 the membership for both groups became combined. In November 2011 the constitutions were agreed and submitted to the charity commission. As of 6 June 2012 the Friends of Bank Hall was officially a registered charity.http://www.charitycommission.gov.uk/Showcharity/RegisterOfCharities/CharityFramework.aspx?RegisteredCharityNumber=1147592&SubsidiaryNumber;=0 Meetings The first meeting of the Bank Hall Action Group was held on 26 July 1995 at The De Trafford Arms public house in Croston.Leyland Guardian, \\"Bid to save historic hall - Action Group meets tonight\\" http://www.bankhall.org.uk/documents/BHAG.pdf 26 July 1995 The Group have met on the first Wednesday of every month since, with an Annual General Meeting held at the May/June meeting. The Lord Nelson public house in Croston was a regular meeting place for the group, which featured in part of the Bank Hall Restoration Campaign in the BBC's Restoration television series of 2003. The FBH and BHAG meetings are now combined and continue to meet once a month. Group structure The Bank Hall Action Group comprised a group Chairman, Vice-Chairman, Treasurer, Secretary, Press Officer and Membership Secretary, along with general members and friends of the group. In 2012, when the group gained their charitable status and became ‚ÄòThe Friends of Bank Hall‚Äô, the group structure changed to become a 16-member trustee group which included the above structure along with general group members. The friends of the group merged in with the general membership. Achievements The Bank Hall clock tower with scaffolding in 2008. On Tuesday 26 September 1995, a conference was held in the council chamber at Chorley Town Hall, the first achievement of the campaign. The outcome was to carry out a feasibility study on the hall. In December 1995, the group's first chairman, Gordon Johnson, met Lord Lilford's agent, who gave the group permission to access to the grounds. Work started to clear the undergrowth to access the building. The group cleared the walled garden and the perimeter of the hall where a security fence was erected enabling public access to be granted to the grounds and trees were cut down creating an area for events. The hall was cleared of debris, bricks were stored and visitors taken on tours of the parts of the house that were accessible. A feasibility study carried out by Niall Philips of Bristol in 1996 reported that it was feasible, practical and desirable to save Bank Hall. On 14 February 2012, it was announced that the ¬£1.69 million from the Heritage Lottery Fund had been awarded for the restoration project to commence. Work on the building is scheduled to begin in late 2012.BBC News (2012) \\"Bank Hall given restoration funding boost\\", Accessed on 15 February 2012 at:https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-england-lancashire-17028499 Projects * \\"Tower Appeal\\" was launched in 1996 with the aim of securing funds for scaffolding to prevent the tower from further collapse.

BBC Restoration Campaign In 2002 the group was approached by the producers of a television program which would feature 30 buildings in need of restoration in ten regional heats. Money raised from a telephone vote was added to a ¬£3million prize fund. The group accepted and Bank Hall was entered into the competition. Bank Hall was the first building to appear in the first season of Restoration in the North West of England but was knocked out by the eventual winner of the series, Victoria Baths, Manchester. The supporters of Bank Hall raised the second highest total of votes in the series. The plan was for Bank Hall to be restored and converted to a college for people with autism, but Autism Initiatives later withdrew from the plans. New developer Following the TV appearance, the group found a new developer, Urban Splash, to produce designs and an action plan for restoring Bank Hall and its of leisure grounds. Urban Splash conducted a structural report in 2009 that enabled a plan of the building's restored interior to be developed.Urban Splash, \\"Structural Engineers Report\\" http://91.194.152.202/AniteIM.WebSearch/Results.aspx?grdResultsP=3 18 December 2009 It was hoped that work would commence in 2010.Nick Moreton ‚Äì Southport Visiter, \\"Bank Hall car show brings in the crowds\\" http://www.southportvisiter.co.uk/southport-news/southport-southport- news/2009/07/31/bank-hall-car-show-brings-in-the-crowds-101022-24277443/ 31 July 2009 However, delays with applications stalled the progress of the project. In February 2010 plans for the restoration were available at events for the public to view.

Meeting the British When the British frigates Briton and Tagus arrived at Pitcairn on the morning of 17 September 1814, Thursday and George Young paddled out in canoes to meet them. Both spoke English well, and made a good impression on the officers and men of the ships as they met on the deck of the Briton. Their demeanour helped persuade the two captains that John Adams had created a civilized society, and did not merit prosecution for the mutiny. The ships stayed only for a few hours, and sailed away later that evening. This was when the only surviving portrait of Thursday was drawn. Captain Philip Pipon, commander of the Tagus, describes Thursday as being \\"about twenty five years of age, a tall fine young man about six feet high, with dark black hair, and a countenance extremely open and interesting. He wore no clothes except a piece of cloth round his loins, a straw hat ornamented with black cock's feathers, and occasionally a peacock's, nearly similar to that worn by the Spaniards in South America, though smaller.\\" Death in Tahiti August 1849 Edward Gennys Fanshawe sketch of Susan Young, the only surviving Tahitian woman on Pitcairn's Island Thursday October Christian II 1820‚Äì1911 Along with a number of other Pitcairners, he migrated to Tahiti in 1831, but having no immunity to the diseases of the island he died on 21 April.

He was a composer of frottole, the popular vocal form ancestral to the madrigal, and later in his career he also wrote madrigals themselves. He also wrote some sacred music and a few instrumental compositions. Life Fa√ßade of Modena Cathedral. Fogliano was organist here from 1479 to 1497. Giacomo Fogliano was the older brother of Lodovico Fogliano (c. 1475 ‚Äì 1542). Lodovico, also a composer, was better known as a theorist. Giacomo was born in Modena, where he evidently spent most of his career. Details of his life are sketchy, but most of his years of employment and at least one of his journeys are known. Early in his life he was praised for his mastery of various instruments, particularly the organ and the harpsichord, and in 1479 he became organist at Modena Cathedral ‚Äì an unusual achievement for a musician of 11.H. Colin Slim. \\"Fogliano, Giacomo.\\" In Grove Music Online. Oxford Music Online, http://www.oxfordmusiconline.com/subscriber/article/grove/music/09920 (accessed October 8, 2009).

Oxford Music Online, http://www.oxfordmusiconline.com/subscriber/article/grove/music/18830 (accessed September 11, 2009) at which time he vanished from the record, reappearing again in 1504, from which year he held the dual post of organist and maestro di cappella until his death in 1548. For the period between 1497 and 1504 he may have been in Siena; a reference to a similarly named individual in the records Siena city archives from 1498 has been tentatively identified as the Fogliano. His first published composition, a frottola in one of Ottaviano Petrucci's earliest prints, dates from 1502 (Venice). Among his duties at Modena was teaching, and from 1512 to 1514 he instructed Giulio Segni on organ and harpsichord. Late in his career, in 1543, he went to Parma to investigate the organ they had installed there. The cathedral in Modena contains a plaque in his honor. Modena at this time was part of the domain of the House of Este, at that time centered in Ferrara. While the town was not a major center of music-making, as it lacked a local aristocratic court, it still had a substantial cathedral which kept an up-to-date repertory of polyphonic music. Fogliano was maestro di cappella at this institution during the period of its collection, and also during the time when Cardinal Giovanni Morone, one of the principal reformers of the Council of Trent, began the process of simplification of polyphony in order to make the text understandable to listeners. Most of Fogliano's sacred music predates this time. Music and influence Of his music, three motets, two laude, 13 frottolas (one of which is attributed in one source to Bartolomeo Tromboncino), 29 madrigals, and four keyboard ricercars have survived. That one of the frottolas was published by Petrucci only one year after the invention of music printing shows the esteem in which it was held, at least by that Venetian printer; Alfred Einstein, writing in The Italian Madrigal, describes the same piece (Segue cuor e non restare) as \\"remarkably awkward\\".Alfred Einstein, The Italian Madrigal. Three volumes. Princeton, New Jersey, Princeton University Press, 1949. Vol. I, p. 297 Two of the other frottolas published by Petrucci as anonymous have since been attributed to Fogliano. Most of his frottolas were probably composed around 1500, which was around the peak time of production of that popular musical form. Like other frottolas, his were for four voices, using a simple homophonic texture, with the melody in the topmost voice. The two inner voices were usually filler and lacking in melodic interest, while the highest and lowest voices frequently moved in parallel tenths. Fogliano began to write madrigals sometime in the mid-1530s, although dates of the individual works cannot be determined precisely. He published his one collection of madrigals, for five voices, in 1547. Stylistically many of these madrigals are like the frottolas he had written forty years before; a few others use a polyphonic style akin to the motet. While most of his madrigals are for five voices, most published in his one book, he wrote several for three voices. At least one of his madrigals appears in a Roman print by Andrea Antico dated 1537, an anthology of madrigals for three voices which includes works by Jacques Arcadelt and Costanzo Festa. One or two of the madrigals without attribution in the same collection may be by Fogliano as well. Fogliano evidently wrote his motets and laude in the early 16th century, probably intending them to be performed by the singers at the cathedral. They are relatively simple and uncluttered in texture compared to similar works of the time from other musical centers, and are singable by amateurs or lightly trained musicians. As the singers in the provincial establishment at Modena were unlikely to have attained the levels of virtuosity found in places such as Ferrara and Venice, these pieces were well suited for this choir. The keyboard ricercares, composed in the 1520s or 1530s and among the earliest examples of the form, are contrapuntal, in the manner of contemporary vocal music, but with shorter points of imitation. They include occasional ostinatos and scalewise flourishes, foreshadowing developments later in the century. Four of these pieces have survived, and were published in the 1940s in I classici musicali italiani (Milan). ReferencesFurther reading * Alfred Einstein, The Italian Madrigal. Three volumes.

Canitz und Dallwitz came from an aristocratic family with roots in the present-day municipality of Thallwitz, in the Meissen-Saxonian area of the Mulde. At the University of Marburg he studied jurisprudence and then entered the service of Hesse-Kassel. During the campaign of 1806 he joined the Prussian Army. In 1812 he was assigned to the general staff of General Ludwig Yorck von Wartenburg, as a part of the Prussian army departed for Russia. After the signing of the Convention of Tauroggen he entered Russian service. Here he participated in the campaign on Berlin and Hamburg under Friedrich Karl von Tettenborn. During the cease-fire in 1813 he returned to Prussian service and again served in the general staff under Yorck. After the war he belonged to the Generalkommando (Command HQ) in Breslau. In 1821, Canitz und Dallwitz became adjutant to Prince Wilhelm, the brother of Frederick William III of Prussia, and simultaneously was a teacher at the Allgemeine Kriegsschule (General War College), which later became the Prussian Military Academy, in Berlin. In this period he anonymously wrote the book: Betrachtungen √ºber die Thaten und Schicksale der Reiterei in den Feldz√ºgen Friedrichs II. und der neuern Zeit; English: Observations on the Actions and Fates of the Cavalry in the Campaigns of Frederick II and Modern Times (2 Bde. Berlin 1823‚Äì24). When Prussia took on a mediating role in the Seventh Russo- Turkish war in 1828, Canitz und Dallwitz was sent as envoy extraordinary to Constantinople. In 1830 he was made chief of the general staff in the Guards Corps, and soon thereafter commander of the 1st Hussar Regiment (1. Leib- Husaren-Regiment Nr. 1). At the Polish rebellion against Russi, he was in the headquarters of the Russian Field Marshal Hans Karl von Diebitsch. In 1833 he was an envoy to the court of Hesse-Kassel and was made a Major General. From 1837 he was an envoy in Hannover and Braunschweig, and from 1842 to 1845 in Vienna. After Heinrich von B√ºlow's resignation (1845), Canitz und Dallwitz was appointed Foreign Minister of Prussia. He aligned his foreign policy with that of the Austrians and Russians, and also influenced domestic policy in terms of his strongly parochial outlook. On 17 March 1848 he resigned, along with the rest of the Bodelschwingh government. In May 1849 he was sent to Vienna, to secure Austria's agreement to the creation of a closer federation, as planned by Prussia. However, Canitz und Dallwitz was forced to return empty-handed. He then took over the command of the 5th Division, in Frankfurt (Oder). Karl Ernst Wilhelm Freiherr von Canitz und Dallwitz died on 25 April 1853 in Frankfurt (Oder).

The boiler was carefully designed for use in a steam wagon: it was compact, easy to handle whilst driving, and its maintenance features recognised the problems of poor feedwater quality and the need for it to be maintained by a small operator, rather than a major locomotive works. Although this design was used in most of Sentinel's products, they also produced larger boilers of quite different types for their railway locomotives.  Description  alt=Section through a Sentinel boiler, showing the water-jacketed drum, the furnace within and the water-tubes above. Sentinel boilers are vertical, as was common for many designs of steam wagon, so as to reduce the effects of tilting due to hill climbing or uneven roads disturbing the water level. It also provides a compact boiler that leaves adequate space in the cab for the crew, controls and coal bunker, whilst leaving as much as possible of the wagon's overall length available for the useful load. The boiler is a watertube boiler, with these tubes contained within a vertical, cylindrical outer drum. This drum is double-walled and forms a water jacket around the boiler, with a large vertical flue within. The inner flue has a complex cross section. It is stepped in three diameters, tapering towards the top. The central region is square in section, rather than round. The main heating surface is provided by water-tubes in this squared section. These tubes are short, straight and pass between the flat faces of the squared section in a grid pattern. There are eight layers of tubes, four banks of six each way. A space is left in the centre of the water-tube banks for the firing chute. restoration of a Sentinel, photo showing inside the boiler. The firebox is top-fired (and lit) through this chute and there is no side firedoor. The lower part of the water-jacketed barrel surrounds the firebox. The narrow waterspace here encourages rapid steam raising. Firing is simple, with a thick fire relative to its area and fuel simply poured down. Beneath the grate is a water-filled ashpan, to prevent hot embers falling onto the road. Draught is controlled by a damper in the side of the ashpan, between the grate and the water tray. Above the tube nest the water space widens to form an increased reservoir, protecting against tilting. Sentinel's drawings permitted a hill climb gradient of 1 in 6. Modern regulations for buses require a safe tilt of 35¬∞. The narrowed flue in this area is used, where fitted, to house the superheater. An unusual feature of the Sentinel boiler was the \\"exhaust drying box\\", a small reheater, in the upper part of the boiler flue, immediately before the blastpipe nozzle. This heated the exhaust steam to avoid it condensing into a visible white plume. It was a requirement of the Highways and Locomotives Act 1878 that engines should \\"consume their own smoke\\".  Washout  5 tonner\\" steam waggon of 1906, with boiler dismantled for cleaningalt=Sentinel steam waggon, with boiler dismantled for cleaning By the nature of their use, steam wagons were often required to use feedwater that was either dirty or contaminated with dissolved minerals. Untreated, this builds up boiler scale on the tubes and particularly deposits sludge in the lower parts of the boiler. Both of these disturb circulation and risk local overheating and damage, scale also reduces boiler efficiency and wastes fuel. The Sentinel boiler was designed to cope with these problems, and to permit easy cleaning of the waterspace. As well as the usual blow-down cock for daily use, the entire boiler could be dismantled easily. The outer shell was in two sections, inner and outer drum, and were joined by a bolted ring joint at top and bottom. Regular servicing (depending on water conditions) was to separate the water-tubes in their drum from the boiler outer shell, so that they could be cleaned. Sludge dropped free on opening the shell and the short, straight tubes could easily be cleaned with brush or scraper. Several other vertical boilers, such as the Straker, had similar arrangements for lifting their shells off the tube nest. The Sentinel though left the outer shell in place and instead dropped the tube nest downwards (having first removed the ashpan). This had the advantages that it required simpler lifting gear: the waggon would be raised on ramps or over a pit, the bolts removed and then the tube bank lowered with a block and tackle from a fixed beam, without requiring a mobile crane that could lift it and then move it sideways. Secondly the many pipe connections to the outer shell were left undisturbed, making the operation quicker. Dropping the firebox was not required at every washout and was recommended at intervals of 2 to 12 months, depending on water quality.  Firebox shape  Inner firebox of the later spiral design Sentinel's best-known flue design was the square-section, but at one time they also used a circular corrugated design, with the water-tubes arranged in a spiral. Manufacture of these was sub-contracted to the well-known boilermakers Galloway of Manchester. When Galloway closed in 1932, Sentinel switched back to their square pattern.  Uses = Steam waggons  The boiler was used throughout Sentinel's range of steam waggons, from the earliest to the last. It was also used for their steam tractors, buses and other vehicles. Mann's of Leeds used a derivation of the Sentinel boiler in their \\"Express\\" wagon, launched in 1924.  Railway locomotives  This particular boiler design was not widely used for Sentinel's railway locomotives. Narrow-gauge locomotives used it, as did the smaller standard gauge models. * LNER Class Y1http://www.lner.info/locos/Y/y1y3.shtml * LNER railmotorsLNER Sentinel steam railcars Their larger locomotives used a range of boiler designs, but all with water-tubes.

West Slavs and Ukrainians use the title Pan, South Slavs and Russians use Gospodin, while Belarusians use either Pan or Spadar, and Lithuanians use either Ponas or Gaspadorius.  Usage of Pan Pan is used to varying degrees in a number of countries ‚Äì Poland, the Czech Republic, Slovakia, Ukraine, Belarus and Lithuania (Ponas). Historically, Pan was equivalent to \\"Lord\\" or \\"Master\\" (ruler, suzerain). Pan is most common in Poland. The feminine form is Pani and the collective is Pa≈Ñstwo. Panna is sometimes used to refer to young women but is becoming less common. The use of Pan differs significantly from English honorifics. It is used as an honorific (roughly equivalent to Mr) before the name (first name and surname, only surname, or only first name) and as a form of address without the name (roughly equivalent to \\"Sir\\"). Use of Pan with the first name in Poland marks a combination of familiarity and respect. Unlike \\"Sir\\", Pan is used both ways between persons of both equal and unequal rank (a waiter will address a guest as Pan, and the customer reciprocates, much like using Monsieur in French). Using Pan with only the first name is regarded as a disrespectful way of addressing people, even somewhat condescending, when it is used to a superior. Using Pan with only the surname, however, is normally respectful if talking about somebody. Pan is never used about oneself (unlike \\"Mr\\"). \\"Pan\\" is also used as a kind of personal pronoun in a similar way as Usted in Spanish or Lei in Italian (unlike French 'Monsieur' or German 'Herr', which require the use of 'vous' and 'Sie' respectively). A non-Slavic language, Lithuanian, has a similar title, Ponas. Other titles Spadar appears in Belarusian. It is a simplified version of Haspadar, which is related to Gospodin or the Slovene Gospodar. Gaspadorius and gaspadinƒó for a women appears in Lithuanian language. It is an archaic word and it is not used today in the general language, however it is not extinct and sometimes used in a countryside. It originated from Proto-Slavic, ultimately from *gospod—å, compare Bulgarian, Serbo-Croatian and Ukrainian –≥–æ—Å–ø–æ–¥–∞—Ä (hospodar), which means householder, master of the house or head of a household. Vladyka (literally, ruler/master), is used when referring to a bishop or patriarch in Eastern Orthodox churches. Sudar, appearing without a personal name, was formerly used in Russian. It may be connected to the Russian title of a head of state, Gosudar. Its Ukrainian counterpart was (Pane) Dobrodiyu or (Pani) Dobrodiyko (pl. Dobrodiyi). Those titles became obsolete and are now found only in novels. Appeal of Shanovni Dobrodiyi (\\"Dear Goodwill\\") is still used solemnly to many people. In Ukrainian, Panych was once used to refer to noble youngsters and generally referred to the Polish people. It is spelled Panicz in Polish.  Under communism  The equivalent of Comrade replaced most titles in the Communist- era Eastern bloc, except Poland. In Poland, Obywatel (\\"citizen\\") replaced Pan, which was restored after the fall of Communism. The word \\"citizen\\" was chosen for ideological reasons as pan (sir) was historically a title of a nobleman. The equivalent of Russian comrade ‚Äì towarzysz ‚Äì was a title reserved only for communist party members.

It was released in the United Kingdom and Europe on October 29, 1971 by CBS Records as a follow-up to the band's first compilation album, The Byrds' Greatest Hits. The album appeared following the band's successful appearance at the Lincoln Folk Festival in England on July 24, 1971 and according to band biographer Johnny Rogan may have been issued by CBS as a reaction to the band's previous studio album, Byrdmaniax, having failed to chart in the UK. The album gathered together many of the singles that the Byrds had issued in the UK since the release of their first compilation in 1967, and as a result, it is the first album to feature the band's recording of Bob Dylan's \\"Lay Lady Lay\\", which had been issued as a non-album single in May 1969. Most of the tracks on the album were originally released between 1968 and 1971, but the song \\"The Times They Are a-Changin'\\" dated from 1965, despite that era of the band's career having already been covered by the Byrds' first greatest hits album. The Byrds' Greatest Hits Volume II failed to reach the UK Albums Chart, but it peaked at number 1 in the Netherlands. The album's critical reception was generally warm, with the NME describing the compilation as, \\"an indispensable acquisition for any student of the cream of American rock, particularly of the roots and influences\\". Nonetheless, a number of contemporary reviews also made note of the album's inaccurate and misleading title, since among the twelve tracks included, only the song \\"Chestnut Mare\\" had been a genuine hit.

Christian, (1968), was a case decided by the Supreme Court of California. It eliminated the categories of invitee, licensee, and trespasser to determine the duty of care owed by a possessor of land to the people on the land. It replaced the classifications with a general duty of care. Background The plaintiff, James Davis Rowland, Jr., was a guest in the apartment of the defendant, Nancy Christian. The plaintiff requested to use the bathroom injured his hand on a broken water faucet handle. The defendant had complained to the landlord about the broken handle but did not warn the plaintiff. The trial judge granted summary judgment on behalf of the defendant, and the plaintiff appealed. Decision=Majority opinion Justice Raymond E. Peters wrote the majority opinion, which explained that common law distinctions between an invitee, licensee, and trespasser traditionally determined the duty of care owed by a possessor of land to a plaintiff. A duty of care to warn about the dangerous condition of an area is owed to invitees and licensees under the distinctions but not to trespassers. The majority considered the classifications to be an unhelpful shortcut to determine negligence, and that a general duty of care should be owed to all visitors to land. The summary judgment for the defendant was reversed because the defendant should have warned the plaintiff of the broken handle.Henderson et al. The Torts Process, Seventh Edition. Aspen Publishers, New York, NY: 2007. p. 223-227 The most heavily quoted passage from Rowland is as follows: As of 2000, Rowland had inspired appellate courts in at least nine other U.S. states and the District of Columbia to completely abandon the traditional distinctions between invitees, licensees, and trespassers, while 14 other U.S. states were persuaded by Rowland to modify and simplify those distinctions.Hall v. Cagle, 773 So. 2d 928, 932 (Miss. 2000) (McRae, J., concurring). Dissenting opinion Justice Louis H. Burke wrote a dissenting opinion in which fellow conservative Justice Marshall F. McComb concurred. Burke argued that the majority had unnecessarily thrown away centuries of clear precedent for a future of \\"potentially unlimited liability.\\" He felt that such a dramatic change in the law should come from the legislature.

In fact, it was a nothing job and I spent from ‚Äò73 to ‚Äò80 there on a seven-year sabbatical.\\" Robison believed that she had been moved to the \\"nothing job\\" because her husband, A. N. R. Robinson, had fallen out with the ruling party which led to his ministerial resignation in April 1970. Robinson joined the National Institute of Higher Education, Research, Science and Technology (NIHERST) in 1980. She served as the NIHERST's Director of Financial Institutions. In the 1980s, Patricia Robinson also proposed a ten-year development plan to implement and strengthen the Tobago House of Assembly, which was created in 1980. Her husband, A. N. R. Robinson, had served as the chairman of the Tobago House of Assembly at the time of the governmental body's inception in 1980. She retired in March 1990. In July 1990, members of the Jamaat al Muslimeen stormed The Red House in Port of Spain during an attempted coup. Several prominent members of the government were taken hostage during the coup attempt, including A. N. R. Robinson, who was the Prime Minister of Trinidad and Tobago at the time. At the height of the hostage crisis, a member of Jamaat al Muslimeen handed Prime Minister Robinson. The note, from Patricia Robinson, read simply \\"I love you.\\" No one knows how Robinson was able to get the note to her husband during the Red House siege. Death Patricia Robinson died in her sleep at her home in Ellerslie Park, Trinidad and Tobago, on September 10, 2009, at the age of 78. Her family doctor pronounced her dead shortly after 6 am local time, in the presence of her daughter, Anne Margaret, and granddaughter. Robinson had been suffering from a number of ailments, including Alzheimer's disease and diabetes, during her later years and had not been seen in public in several years. She was survived by her husband, former President A. N. R. Robinson (Late A.N.R Robinson died 9 April 2014), their two children, Anne Margaret (Bsc Mathematics) a teacher (Head of Department), and David Robinson, an aeronautical engineer, and granddaughter, Anushka. Her funeral was held at the St. Joseph Roman Catholic Church in Scarborough, Tobago. Robinson chose to be buried in Scarborough Methodist Cemetery in Tobago, the birthplace of her husband.

It was published in an expanded form in 1814, and revised and expanded throughout his life (see 1811 in poetry, 1814 in poetry). The work describes Hunt's contemporary poets, and either praises or mocks them by allowing only the best to dine with Apollo. The work also provided commentary on William Wordsworth and Romantic poetry. Critics praised or attacked the work on the basis of their sympathies towards Hunt's political views. Background In 1811, Hunt began a magazine called the Reflector, which carried poetry and other literature. One of the works that he submitted was The Feast of the Poets. The work was intended as an update of the 17th century tradition of \\"Sessions of the Poets\\", a satirical portrayal of contemporary poets both good and bad. In 1813, James Cawthorn, a publisher, asked Hunt to complete a full length edition of the poem that would include both an introduction and notes to the work. Hunt began to work on the poem and the work was soon expanded.Roe 2005 pp. 125‚Äì126, 201 In January 1814, the work was published and well received by Hunt's friends. The new edition was dedicated to Thomas Mitchell and it ended with a sonnet that was dedicated to Thomas Barnes, both friends of Hunt.Roe 2005 p. 203 The poem would be revised throughout Hunt's life, including an edition in 1815.Holden 2005 pp. 53, 79 Poem The poem satirically describes many of Hunt's contemporaries: Wordsworth is experiencing a \\"second childhood\\", Coleridge \\"muddles\\" in writing, and William Gifford is a \\"sour little gentleman\\".Roe 2005 p. 126 Four great poets, Thomas Moore, Walter Scott, Robert Southey, and Thomas Campbell are allowed to dine with Apollo while Samuel Rogers is only allowed to have tea.Holden 2005 p. 85 In the rewrite, Hunt says that was not included because \\"I haven't the brains\\".Roe 2005 p. 126 His view of Wordsworth changed to praising Wordsworth as a great poet but also one that \\"substitute[s] one set of diseased perceptions for another: > he says to us, \\"Your complexion is diseased your blood fevered you endeavour > to keep up your pleasurable sensations by stimulants too violent to last, > which must be succeeded by others of still greater violence:- this will not > do: your mind wants air and exercise, ‚Äì fresh thoughts and natural > excitements:- up, my friend; come out with me among the beauties of nature > and the simplicities of life, and feel the breath of heaven about you\\". ‚Äì No > advice can be better: we feel the call instinctively; we get up, accompany > the poet into his walks, and acknowledge them to be the best and the most > beautiful; but what do we meet there? Idiot boys, Mad Mothers, Wandering > Jews...Roe 2009 qtd. pp. 202‚Äì203 Regardless of the problems, Hunt admits to a connection with Wordsworth, especially in their use of poetry to deal with complex psychological issues.Roe 2009 p. 203 Themes The purpose of the notes was to describe, in Hunt's view, what would happen to the reputation of various poets. He placed a particular emphasis on the British Romantic poetry, including Lyrical Ballads, that sought to overcome the standards of neoclassical poetry with emphasis on the problems inherent in the French standards created by those like Nicholas Despreaux-Boileau. As such, Hunt praises Wordsworth as the leader of a new type of poetry.Roe 2005 pp. 201‚Äì202 Although Byron is not fully discussed in early editions of the poem, he is discussed in the notes as an individual who would become an important person who had already \\"taken his place, beyond a doubt, in the list of English Poets\\".Roe 2005 qtd p. 202 By the 1815 edition, Byron was introduced and was praised by Apollo, which reflected a friendship between the two.Holden 2005 p. 79 The work influenced how critics viewed Romantic poetry. Hunt's interpretation of Wordsworth and Wordsworth's poetry was later picked up and developed by William Hazlitt in a review of Wordsworth's Excursion. Hazlitt emphasised the egotistical aspects of Wordsworth's regular contemplation in his works. Hazlitt also relied on Hunt's criticism of Wordsworth preferring common people as his heroes. Hazlitt's review, grounded in Hunt's ideas, influenced John Keats's view of the \\"wordsworthian or egotistical sublime\\". Coleridge, in Biographia Literaria, relied on Hunt's claim that Wordsworth focused on the morbid aspects of life or dwelled too much on abstract concepts.Roe 2009 pp. 212‚Äì213 Critical response Hunt received favourable responses from many of his friends and from Byron and Byron's friend Thomas Moore. However, the magazines were divided on the basis of their political views as they matched with Hunt's own. Many claimed that Hunt's poem was seditious, including the British Critic, New Monthly Magazine and The Satirist. To the contrary, the Champion, with a review by John Scott, along with the Eclectic and the Monthly Review, praised the work. The Critical Review believed that Hunt should have stressed society when discussing Wordsworth's poetry.Roe 2009 pp. 203‚Äì204 NotesReferences * Blainey, Ann. Immortal Boy.

Plot summary The Forge of Fury is a dungeon crawl, or site-based adventure, that describes the stronghold of Khundrukar. The great dwarven smith, Durgeddin the Black, founded the secret stronghold within a great cavern system two hundred years ago when he and his clan were driven from their home by a horde of orcs and trolls. The orcs discovered the location of Khundrukar, Durgeddin's home, a century ago when they captured one of Durgeddin's clansmen. The orcs raised a great army that stormed the stronghold and slew the dwarves there, allowing the stronghold's five levels to fall into ruins. Now goblins, orcs and other monsters use the ruins as a base. Legends tell of the extraordinary blades Durgeddin forged in anger, enticing the player characters to come to the ruins of Khundrukar to obtain them. Publication history The book was published in 2000 and written by Richard Baker, with cover art by Todd Lockwood and interior art by Dennis Cramer. In 2017, Wizards re-released the adventure, updated to 5th Edition rules, as part of the Tales from the Yawning Portal collection. Reception A reviewer from Pyramid commented that the \\"first few pages are very good at walking new Dungeon Masters through the steps needed to properly prepare for the adventure\\", also noting that \\"like the Sunless Citadel, the main focus is on the adventure.\\" Conversely, an RPGnet review criticized the lack of hints in the package, but praised the adventure as following \\"in the mold of the great classics of the first edition\\".

He achieved the rank of Field Marshal and died at the Battle of Stockach. The third son of a cadet branch of the House of F√ºrstenberg, at his birth his chances of inheriting the family title of F√ºrst zu F√ºrstenberg were slight; he was prepared instead for a military career, and a tutor was hired to teach him the military sciences. He entered the Habsburg military in 1777, at the age of seventeen years, and was a member of the field army in the short War of the Bavarian Succession (1778‚Äì79). His career progressed steadily during the Habsburg War with the Ottoman Empire. In particular he distinguished himself at ≈†abac in 1790, when he led his troops in storming the fortress on the Sava river. During the French Revolutionary Wars, he fought with distinction again for the First Coalition, particularly at Ketsch and Fr≈ìschwiller, and in 1796 at Emmendingen, Schliengen and Kehl. He was stationed at key points to protect the movements of the Austrian army. With a force of 10,000, he defended the German Rhineland at Kehl, and reversed a bayonet assault by French troops at Bellheim; his troops also overran Speyer without any losses. By the end of the War of the First Coalition, at the age of 35, he had achieved the rank of Field Marshal. During the War of the Second Coalition, he fought in the first two battles of the German campaign, at Ostrach on 21 March 1799, and at Stockach on 25 March 1799. At the latter action while leading a regiment of grenadiers, he was hit by French case shot and knocked off his horse. He died shortly afterward. Childhood and early military training As the third son of a cadet (junior) branch of the F√ºrstenberg princely family, Karl Aloys was prepared for a military career. His tutor, Lieutenant Ernst, was in active service in the Habsburg military, and took six-year-old Karl Aloys on maneuvers with him. In this way, he learned as a child the Habsburg military manual, and came into contact with important military men who later furthered his education and career; he also acquired an honorary rank as Kreis-Obristen, or Colonel of the Imperial Circle, by the time he was ten years old. Ernst Hermann Joseph M√ºnch. Geschichte des Hauses und Landes F√ºrstenberg. Aachen: Mayer, 1847, p. 318. As a youth, in 1776, he met the Habsburg war minister Count Franz Moritz von Lacy and Baron Ernst Gideon von Laudon; he was also invited to dine with Emperor Joseph II. He started his service in 1777 as a F√§hnrich (ensign) in the Habsburg military organization. He saw his first field service during the War of the Bavarian Succession (1777‚Äì78), although he was not involved in any battles.

In 1780, at the age of twenty years, he was promoted to captain, and assigned to the 34th Infantry Regiment, also known as the Anton Esterh√°zy, named for Paul II Anton Esterh√°zy, the general of cavalry, field marshal of the Seven Years' War, and ambassador to Britain. While he was assigned to this unit, he participated in the border conflicts between the Ottoman Empire and the Habsburgs, 1787‚Äì92, and stormed the fortress at ≈†abac (German: Schabatz) on the Sava River in Serbia on 27 April 1788. For his action at ≈†abac, he was personally commended by the Emperor; on the following day, he was promoted to major and given command of a grenadier battalion.Smith. \\"F√ºrstenberg\\". On 1 January 1790, at Laudon's explicit request, Karl Aloys zu F√ºrstenberg was promoted to major general; at the end of June of that year, he received the coveted position of second colonel of the 34th Infantry Regiment Anton Esterhazy, where he served as the executive officer for Antal, Prince Esterh√°zy de Gal√°ntha, the 34th Hungarian Regiment's Colonel and Proprietor.

This was a customary appointment in which a less prominent officer completed the day-to-day administrative duties of the Colonel and Proprietor, who was usually a noble and was often posted in a different assignment, sometimes a different staff location.Stephen Herold. The Austrian Army in 1812. In: Le Societ√© Napol√©onienne. Accessed 31 December 2009. Karl Aloys zu F√ºrstenberg also received the confraternal Order of Saint Hubert from the Duke of Bavaria and married the \\"elegant\\" Princess Elisabeth of Thurn und Taxis (1767‚Äì1822), that year.M√ºnch, p. 331. Princess Elisabeth of Thurn und Taxis (Regensburg, 30 November 1767 ‚Äì 21 July 1822), was the youngest daughter of Alexander Ferdinand, 3rd Prince of Thurn and Taxis. Fight against Revolutionary France While Karl Aloys zu F√ºrstenberg fought for the Habsburg cause in Serbia, in France, a coalition of the clergy and the professional and bourgeois class‚Äîthe First and Third estates‚Äîled a call for reform of the French government and the creation of a written constitution. Initially, the rulers of Europe viewed the French Revolution as an event between the French king and his subjects, and not something in which they should interfere. In 1790, Leopold succeeded his brother Joseph as emperor and by 1791, he considered the situation surrounding his sister, Marie Antoinette, and her children, with greater alarm. In August 1791, in consultation with French √©migr√© nobles and Frederick William II of Prussia, he issued the Declaration of Pillnitz, in which they declared the interest of the monarchs of Europe as one with the interests of Louis XVI and his family. They threatened ambiguous, but quite serious, consequences if anything should happen to the royal family. The French √©migr√©s continued to agitate for support of a counter-revolution. On 20 April 1792, the French National Convention declared war on Austria. In the War of the First Coalition (1792‚Äì1797), France opposed most of the European states sharing land or water borders with her, plus Portugal and the Ottoman Empire.Timothy Blanning.

He was stationed in the Breisgau, a Habsburg territory between the Black Forest and the Rhine. This location between the forested mountains and the river included two important bridgeheads across the river which offered access to southwestern Germany, the Swiss Cantons, or north-central Germany. His brigade defended Kehl, a small village immediately across the Rhine from Strasbourg, but most of the action in 1792 occurred further north, in present- day Belgium, near the cities of Speyer and Trier, and at Frankfurt on the Main River.Smith, pp. 31‚Äì34. In the second year of the war, F√ºrstenberg was transferred to the cavalry of Dagobert Sigmund von Wurmser, in the Army of the Upper Rhine, and placed in charge of the advance guard near Speyer, which was still held by the French. On 30 March, he crossed the Rhine by Ketsch at the head of the advance guard, which included 9,000 men. He took the city of Speyer on 1 April, in the absence of the commander of the city, Adam-Philippe de Custine, who was away with most of his troops; those that remained behind simply abandoned the city. On the following day, F√ºrstenberg occupied the town of Germersheim. His first combat action of the war occurred on 3 April, when Custine's infantry attacked him in a bayonet charge near the villages of Bellheim, H√∂rdt and Leimersheim, and afterward at Landau and Lauterburg. During these attacks, he lost all the ground he had gained in the days before. After these events, he was again transferred, this time to the command of the Regiment Count von Kavanagh, where he continued to distinguish himself during the French counter-offensive of October‚ÄìNovember 1793. In the action around Geidertheim, on the Zorn River, he assisted Lieutenant Field Marshal Gabriel Anton, Baron Spl√©ny de Mih√°ldy, in repelling a French counter-attack. Shortly afterward, he became very ill and, in December 1793, was sent to the Hagenau to recover. On 22 December, he rejoined Wurmser's Corps for the Battle of Froeschwiller against Lazare Hoche and Charles Pichegru. After the French retreated over the Rhine at H√ºningen, near Basel, he directed the construction of its new fortifications. Jens-Florian Ebert, \\"Feldmarschall-Leutnant F√ºrst zu F√ºrstenberg,\\" Die √ñsterreichischen Gener√§le 1792‚Äì1815. In June 1796, F√ºrstenberg commanded a division of four infantry battalions, 13 artillery pieces, and the Freikorps (Volunteers) Gyulay and secured the Rhine corridor between Kehl and Rastatt. On 26 June 1796, the French troops of the Army of the Rhine-and-Moselle crossed the Rhine and chased the Swabian Circle's military contingent out of Kehl. In June 1796, Archduke Charles added the contingent to F√ºrstenberg's command, making him the Swabian's Feldzeugmeister, or General of Infantry. F√ºrstenberg's troops defended the imperial line at the town of Rastatt until support troops arrived, and they could make an orderly withdrawal into the Upper Danube Valley.Smith. \\"F√ºrstenberg\\". The Swabian contingent was demobilized in July, and F√ºrstenberg returned to the command of Austrian regulars during the Austrian counter-offensive. At the Battle of Emmendingen on 19 October 1796, his leadership was again instrumental in an Austrian victory. General Jean Victor Marie Moreau's Army of the Rhine-and- Moselle sought to retain a foothold on the eastern side of the Rhine, following his retreat from southwestern Germany west of the Black Forest. F√ºrstenberg held Kenzingen, north of Riegel on the Elz River. Karl Aloys zu F√ºrstenberg was ordered to feint against Riegel, to protect the primary Austrian positions at Rust and Kappel.J. Rickard. \\"Battle of Emmendingen,\\" 19 October 1796. History of War. Peter D. Antill, Tristan Dugdale-Pointon and J. Rickard, editors. February 2009 update. Accessed 7 October 2009. In the Battle of Schliengen (24 October 1796), F√ºrstenberg commanded the second column of the Austrian force, which included nine battalions of infantry and 30 squadrons of cavalry; with these, he overwhelmed the force of General of Division Gouvion Saint-Cyr, holding his position to prevent the French force from retreating north on the Rhine. While Maximilian Anton Karl, Count Baillet de Latour, engaged the main Austrian force at Kehl, Archduke Charles entrusted to Lieutenant Field Marshal F√ºrstenberg the command of the forces besieging H√ºningen, which included two divisions with 20 battalions of infantry and 40 squadrons of cavalry. Charles' confidence in his young field marshal was well- placed. On 27 November, F√ºrstenberg's chief engineer opened and drained the water-filled moat protecting the French fortifications. F√ºrstenberg offered the commander of the bridgehead, General of Brigade Jean Charles Abbatucci, the opportunity to surrender, which he declined. In the night of 30 November to 1 December, F√ºrstenberg's force stormed the bridgehead twice, but was twice repulsed. In one of these attacks, the French commander was mortally wounded and died on 3 December. F√ºrstenberg maintained the Siege of Kehl while Archduke Charles engaged the stronger French force to the north of Kehl. Ebert, \\"Feldmarschall-Leutnant F√ºrst zu F√ºrstenberg,\\" Die √ñsterreichischen Gener√§le 1792‚Äì1815. After the French capitulation at Kehl (10 January 1797), F√ºrstenberg received additional forces with which he could end the siege at H√ºningen. He ordered the reinforcement of the ring of soldiers surrounding H√ºningen and, on 2 February 1797, the Austrians prepared to storm the bridgehead. General of Division Georges Joseph Dufour, the new French commander, pre-empted what would have been a costly attack, by offering to surrender the bridge. On 5 February, F√ºrstenberg finally took possession of the bridgehead. Francis II, the Holy Roman Emperor, appointed him as Colonel and Proprietor of the 36th Infantry Regiment, which bore his name until his death in battle in 1799. Ebert, \\"Feldmarschall-Leutnant F√ºrst zu F√ºrstenberg,\\" Die √ñsterreichischen Gener√§le 1792‚Äì1815. Peace The Coalition forces‚ÄîAustria, Russia, Prussia, Great Britain, Sardinia, among others‚Äîachieved several victories at Verdun, Kaiserslautern, Neerwinden, Mainz, Amberg and W√ºrzburg, but in northern Italy, they could neither lift nor escape the siege at Mantua. The efforts of Napoleon Bonaparte in northern Italy pushed Austrian forces to the border of Habsburg lands. Napoleon dictated a cease-fire at Leoben on 17 April 1797, leading to the formal Treaty of Campo Formio, which went into effect on 17 October 1797. Austria withdrew from the territories the army had fought so hard to acquire, including the strategic river crossings at H√ºningen and Kehl, as well as key cities further north.Blanning, pp. 41‚Äì59. When the war ended, F√ºrstenberg stayed at the Donaueschingen estate of his cousin, Karl Joachim Aloys, who had recently inherited the family title as F√ºrst zu F√ºrstenberg. Later in 1797, he traveled to Prague and remained with his family until May 1798, when he received a posting to a new division in Linz. Ebert, \\"Feldmarschall-Leutnant F√ºrst zu F√ºrstenberg,\\" Die √ñsterreichischen Gener√§le 1792‚Äì1815. His daughter, Maria Anna, was born after he left, on 17 September 1798.M√ºnch, pp. 331‚Äì336.  Activities in the Second Coalition  Despite the longed-for peace, tensions grew between France and most of the First Coalition allies, either separately or jointly. Ferdinand IV of Naples refused to pay agreed-upon tribute to France, and his subjects followed this refusal with a rebellion. The French invaded Naples and established the Parthenopaean Republic. A republican uprising in the Swiss cantons, encouraged by the French Republic which offered military support, led to the overthrow of the Swiss Confederation and the establishment of the Helvetic Republic.Blanning, pp. 230‚Äì232. On his way to Egypt in Spring 1798, Napoleon had stopped on the Island of Malta and removed the Hospitallers from their possessions. This angered Paul, Tsar of Russia, who was the honorary head of the Order. The ongoing French occupation of Malta angered the British, who dedicated themselves to ejecting the French garrison at Valletta. The French Directory was convinced that the Austrians were conniving to start another war. Indeed, the weaker the French Republic seemed, the more seriously the Austrians, the Neapolitans, the Russians, and the British actually discussed this possibility.John Gallagher.

As winter broke on 1 March 1799, General Jean Baptiste Jourdan and his 25,000-man Army of the Danube crossed the Rhine at Kehl.John Young, D.D. A History of the Commencement, Progress, and Termination of the Late War between Great Britain and France which continued from the first day of February 1793 to the first of October 1801, in two volumes. Edinburg: Turnbull, 1802, vol. 2, p. 220. The Army of the Danube met little resistance as it advanced through the Black Forest and eventually took a flanking position on the north shore of Lake Constance.Rothenberg, pp. 49‚Äì50. Instructed to block the Austrians from access to the Swiss alpine passes, Jourdan planned to isolate the armies of the Coalition in Germany from allies in northern Italy, and prevent them from assisting one another. His was a preemptive strike. By crossing the Rhine in early March, Jourdan acted before Archduke Charles' army could be reinforced by Austria's Russian allies, who had agreed to send 60,000 seasoned soldiers and their more-seasoned commander, Generalissimo Alexander Suvorov. Furthermore, if the French held the interior passes in Switzerland, they could not only prevent the Austrians from transferring troops between northern Italy and southwestern Germany, but could use the routes to move their own forces between the two theaters.Rothenberg, pp. 70‚Äì74. Battle of Ostrach At the outbreak of hostilities in March 1799, Karl Aloys zu F√ºrstenberg was with his troops in Bavarian territory, just north of the free and Imperial city of Augsburg. When news reached the Austrian camp that the French had crossed the Rhine, Charles ordered the imperial army to advance west. F√ºrstenberg moved his troops toward Augsburg, crossing the Lech River.Ramsey Weston Phipps, The Armies of the First French Republic, volume 5: \\"The armies of the Rhine in Switzerland, Holland, Italy, Egypt and the coup d'etat of Brumaire, 1797‚Äì1799,\\" Oxford: Oxford University Press, 1939, pp. 49‚Äì50. The French advanced guard arrived in Ostrach on 8‚Äì9 March, and over the next week skirmished with the Austrian forward posts, while the rest of the French army arrived. Jourdan disposed his 25,000 troops along a line from Salem Abbey and Lake Constance to the Danube river, centered in Ostrach. He established his command headquarters at the imperial city of Pfullendorf, overlooking the entire Ostrach valley. Jourdan was expecting Dominique Vandamme's troops to arrive in time to support his far north flank near the river, but Vandamme had gone to Stuttgart to investigate a rumored presence of Austrian troops there and had not rejoined the main army. Consequently, the French left flank, under command of Gouvion Saint-Cyr, was thinly manned. Jourdan thought he had more time, expecting Charles would need still three or four days to move his troops across the Lech, and march to Ostrach, but by the middle of Holy Week in 1799, more than a third of Charles' army, 48,000 mixed troops, was positioned in a formation parallel to Jourdan's, and his 72,000 remaining troops were arrayed with the left wing at Kempten, the center near Memmingen, and the right flank extended to Ulm.Phipps, pp. 49‚Äì50. By 21 March, the French and Austrian outposts overlapped, and skirmishing intensified. Charles had divided his force into four columns. F√ºrstenberg covered the northern flank of the Archduke's main force. F√ºrstenberg's force pushed the French out of Davidsweiler, and then advanced on Ruppersweiler and Einhard, 5 kilometers (3 mi) to the northwest of Ostrach. Saint-Cyr did not have the manpower to defend the position, and the entire line fell back to Ostrach, with F√ºrstenberg's troops pressuring their withdrawal.Edward Cust (Sir). Annals of the wars of the eighteenth century, compiled from the most authentic histories of the period. London: Mitchell's military library, 1857‚Äì1860, p. 166. F√ºrstenberg's persistent pressure on the French left flank was instrumental in the collapse of the northern part of the French line. After their success in driving the French back from Ostrach, and then from the heights of Pfullendorf, the Austrian forces continued to press the French back to Stockach, and then another five miles or so to Engen. Ebert, \\"Feldmarschall-Leutnant F√ºrst zu F√ºrstenberg,\\" Die √ñsterreichischen Gener√§le 1792‚Äì1815. Death at the Battle of Stockach (1799) Death of Feldmarschall-Leutnant Karl Aloys zu F√ºrstenberg while leading Austrian infantry during the battle of Stockach. On the morning of what they suspected would be the general engagement, Karl Aloys zu F√ºrstenberg sought out the field chaplain, and requested the sacraments because, as he told his aide, anything can happen during a battle. Although Ostrach had been a hard-fought battle, at Engen and Stockach, the Austrian and French forces were far more concentrated‚Äîmore men in a smaller space‚Äîthan they had been at Ostrach, where the French forces in particular had been stretched thinly on a long line from Lake Constance to north of the Danube. At Stockach, furthermore, Jourdan had all his troops under his direct control, with the possible exception of Dominique Vandamme, who was maneuvering his small force of cavalry and light infantry into position to attempt a flanking action on the far right Austrian flank.Phipps, pp. 49‚Äì50. In the course of the battle, Jourdan's forces were supposed to engage in simultaneous attacks on the left, center and right of the Austrian line.Phipps, pp. 49‚Äì50. On the French right, Souham's and Ferino's Corps met with strong resistance and were stopped; on the French left, Lefebvre's troops charged with such force that the Austrians were pushed back. Having stopped Souham's and Ferino's assault, Charles had troops available to counter Lefebvre's force. At that point, Vandamme's men moved into action. Ebert, \\"Feldmarschall-Leutnant F√ºrst zu F√ºrstenberg,\\" Die √ñsterreichischen Gener√§le 1792‚Äì1815. Because Souham's assault at the center had been stalled, Charles still had enough men to turn part of his force to fight this new threat, but the Austrians were hard pressed and the action furious. At one point, Charles attempted to lead his eight battalions of Hungarian grenadiers into action, to the dismay of the old soldiers. F√ºrstenberg reportedly said that while he lived, he would not leave this post (at the head of the grenadiers) and the Archduke should not dismount and fight. M√ºnch, p. 330. As F√ºrstenberg led the Hungarian grenadiers into the battle, he was cut down by a canister and case shot employed by the French.Phipps, pp. 49‚Äì50. Although he was carried alive off the field, he died almost immediately. Charles ultimately did lead his grenadiers into battle, and reportedly his personal bravery rallied his troops to push back the French. Ebert, \\"Feldmarschall-Leutnant F√ºrst zu F√ºrstenberg,\\" Die √ñsterreichischen Gener√§le 1792‚Äì1815. After the battle, someone removed F√ºrstenberg's wedding ring and returned it to his wife in Prague, with news of his death; F√ºrstenberg was buried at the battlefield cemetery in Stockach, and his cousin erected a small monument there, M√ºnch, p. 335. but in 1857, his body was moved to the family cemetery, Maria Hof at Neudingen, near Donaueschingen. Ebert, \\"Feldmarschall-Leutnant F√ºrst zu F√ºrstenberg,\\" Die √ñsterreichischen Gener√§le 1792‚Äì1815. Family Princess Elisabeth of Thurn and Taxis, who married Karl Aloys in 1790. Upon the death of Prosper Ferdinand, Count F√ºrstenberg, in the War of the Spanish Succession, in 1704 the F√ºrstenberg inheritance was divided between the count's two youngest sons, Joseph Wilhelm Ernst and Wilhelm Egon; the eldest son was an ecclesiastic. The family of F√ºrstenberg was raised to princely status 2 February 1716, with the elevation of Joseph Wilhelm Ernst, as the first Prince (F√ºrst) of F√ºrstenberg (German: F√ºrst zu F√ºrstenberg).For a more complete description of the history of this family, see the entry by Hugh Chisholm. \\"F√ºrstenberg\\". The Encyclop√¶dia Britannica: a Dictionary of Arts, Sciences, Literature and General Information. Cambridge, England, New York: At the University Press, 1910‚Äì11 or Ernst Hermann Joseph M√ºnch; Carl Borrom√§us Alois Fickler. Geschichte des Hauses und Landes F√ºrstenberg: aus Urkunden und den besten Quellen. Aachen: Mayer, 1847. The first prince had three sons, Joseph Wenzel Johann Nepomuk (1728‚Äì1783), Karl Borrom√§us Egon (1729‚Äì1787), and Prosper Maria, who died in infancy. The title passed through the line of the first son, Joseph Wenzel Johann Nepomuk (as second prince), to his son Joseph Maria Benedikt Karl (third prince, who died in 1796) and then to another son of the second prince, Karl Joachim Aloys (fourth prince). The last son of Joseph Wilhelm Ernst died in 1803 without male issue. Consequently, the title passed to the male line of first prince's second son. This son, Karl Borrom√§us Egon, had died in 1787.M√ºnch, pp. 237‚Äì266. Karl Borrom√§us Egon's oldest son, Joseph Maria Wenzel (16 August 1754 ‚Äì 14 July 1759), died as a small child. The second son, Philipp Nerius Maria (Prague, 21 October 1755 ‚Äì 5 June 1790), married in 1779 to his first cousin, Josepha Johanna Benedikta von F√ºrstenberg (sister of the third and fourth princes), at Donaueschingen. Only one of their sons survived childhood, but died at the age of 15 years. The other children of this second son were all daughters, and thus not eligible to inherit the title Prince of F√ºrstenberg. Consequently, the title devolved to the agnatic male descendants of Karl Aloys zu F√ºrstenberg.M√ºnch, pp. 267, 281‚Äì266. In 1803, two of Karl Aloys zu F√ºrstenberg's children were still living. Karl Egon, as the surviving son, inherited the title Prince of F√ºrstenberg; he and his eldest sister lived into adulthood and produced families.M√ºnch, pp. 318, 337. Children of Karl Aloys zu F√ºrstenberg and Elizabeth, Princess of Thurn und Taxis, were: * Marie Leopoldine (Prague, 4 September 1791 ‚Äì Kupferzell, 10 January 1844); married at Heiligenberg, 20 May 1813 to Charles Albert III, Prince of Hohenlohe-Waldenburg-Schillingsf√ºrst (Vienna, 29 February 1776 ‚Äì Bad Mergentheim, 15 June 1843) * Maria Josepha (9 September 1792) * Antonie (28 October 1794 ‚Äì 1 October 1799) * Karl Egon II (Prague, 28 October 1796 ‚Äì Bad Ischl 22 October 1854), succeeded his cousin, Joachim, as the fifth F√ºrst zu F√ºrstenberg on 17 May 1804. He married on 19 April 1818, to Amalie Christine Karoline, of Baden (Karlsruhe, 26 January 1795 ‚Äì Karlsruhe, 14 September 1869). * Maria Anna, 17 September 1798 ‚Äì 18 July 1799M√ºnch, pp. 316‚Äì336.

It has rough, tessellated bark on the lower trunk abruptly changing to smooth, whitish bark above, narrow lance-shaped adult leaves, flower buds in groups of three or seven, white flowers and cylindrical or urn-shaped fruit Description Corymbia terminalis is a tree that typically grows to a height of and forms a lignotuber. The trunk is almost always straight, making up a half to two thirds of the total tree height, with a crown of slender branches. It has rough, tessellated greyish bark on the lower of the trunk, abruptly changing to smooth whitish bark above. Young plants and coppice regrowth have lance-shaped leaves that are arranged in opposite pairs at first, long and wide, tapering to a short petiole or sessile. Adult leaves are arranged alternately, the same shade of green to greyish on both sides, narrow lance- shaped to linear, long and wide on a petiole long. The flower buds are arranged on the ends of branchlets on a branched peduncle long, each branch of the peduncle with three or seven buds on pedicels long. Mature buds are oval to pear-shaped, long and wide with a rounded operculum, often with a small point on the tip. Flowering mainly occurs between October and January and the flowers are white. The fruit is a cylindrical or urn-shaped, thin-walled capsule long and wide on a pedicel long and with the valves enclosed in the fruit. Taxonomy Carbeen was first formally described in 1859 by Ferdinand von Mueller who gave it the name Eucalyptus tessellaris in Journal of the Proceedings of the Linnean Society, Botany. In 1995, Ken Hill and Lawrie Johnson changed the name to Corymbia tessellaris, publishing the change in the journal Telopea. Distribution and habitat Corymbia tessellaris is widespread in north-eastern Australia where it grows in undulating open forest and woodland. It is found from Cape York Peninsula and south through eastern Queensland to near Narrabri and Kyogle in northern New South Wales. It also occurs on some Torres Strait Islands and in southern New Guinea. Uses=Indigenous uses Yirrganydji and Djabugay people use medicine made from the tree to treat wounds and conditions such as dysentery and use the wood to make tools. Use in horticulture Carbeen is resistant to strong winds, heat and drought and can be propagated from seed. Use in industry The wood is heavy and has been used for bridge construction and making spears. The tree produces many organic compounds with industrial potential including pinenes, aromadendrene, limonene and globulol.

The mid-tempo electro-R&B; song was written by Amanda Ghost, Lopez, Pitbull and Pharrell Williams, while production was handled by The Neptunes. Ghost brought the song to Lopez, who although loved it, didn't think it matched the sound of the music she had been recording at the time. Lopez eventually decided to record the song and release it as a promotional single in anticipation of her seventh studio album Love? (2011). The song premiered online on October 7, 2009 and was promoted to clubs in the United States by Epic Records. An accompanying music video for \\"Fresh Out the Oven\\" was directed by Jonas Akerlund, which features the use of repetitious images for a hypnotic effect and avoids showing any of the actors' faces until the final act. \\"Fresh Out the Oven\\" received generally positive acclaim from music critics. The song managed to reach number one on the U.S. Dance Club Chart.  Background  Pitbull's appearance on \\"Fresh Out the Oven\\" led the two to work together on several other recordings, such as \\"On the Floor\\", \\"Dance Again\\" and \\"Live It Up\\". Following the commercial and critical failure of her sixth studio album Brave (2007)‚Äîand while pregnant with twins Max and Emme‚ÄîLopez began working on new music for a future project in 2008. The project was kept under wraps until February 2009 when a new song from the recording sessions titled \\"Hooked on You\\" leaked online. Lopez addressed the leak on her official website in May 2009, stating that \\"I'm always excited about my music and this [\\"Hooked on You\\"] is one of a few tracks I'm currently working on. I'm flattered by everyone's interest in the track and really excited for you to hear the real thing...\\" Following the leak of \\"Hooked on You\\", \\"One Love\\" and \\"What Is Love?\\" (later re-titled \\"(What Is) Love?\\") were subsequently leaked online in May. The leaked songs were, at the time, meant to appear on a greatest hits album; that later turned into a studio album. In June 2009, Lopez told MTV's Larry Carol that the songs hinted at the musical direction of her then-upcoming seventh studio album. She also stated that she was keen to finish the album and several singles, with a potential release date for the end of 2009. On the red carpet of the 2009 MTV Video Music Awards on September 13, 2009, American rapper Pitbull revealed that he had recorded a new track with Lopez that would be released as the first single from her then- upcoming seventh studio album. The song's title, initially announced by Pitbull as \\"Lola\\", was later revealed to be called \\"Fresh Out the Oven\\". Despite Pitbull announcing the song to be the first single from Lopez's seventh studio album, it was later announced that the song would only serve as a buzz single and would not appear on her album. The song made its premiere on October 7 via People.com.  Music and lyrics  \\"Fresh Out the Oven\\" is a mid-tempo electro-R&B; song, with a length of three minutes and thirty-five seconds (3:35). The song was co-written by Lopez, along with Amanda Ghost, Pitbull and Pharrell Williams, who produced the song with his production team The Neptunes. Lopez opens the first verse of the song by the lines: \\"Now don't tell me that you love me to get with this / You say you stay forever / But it don't make sense\\". According to Tamar Anitai of MTV Buzzworthy, the song is a throwback \\"to her dancehall / dance-chart days\\" and a reminder that \\"she'll always be that Fly Girl\\". An editor from website C√≥digo Venezuela named the song \\"a theme that blends hip hop with electronic sounds, leaving a sensual interpretation by Lopez while her partner makes its peculiar mixture of Spanish with English\\". In an interview in March 2010, Lopez said about the song: \\"The head of my record company, Amanda, really loved this record. She said, 'This record is for Jennifer Lopez. We've got to get this record to Jennifer Lopez'. She let me hear it and I said, 'You know what? I love the record, but it doesn't fit in with the album I'm making. And she said, I don't care. You just have to record this record. I don't care if you put another name on it. And so we did and we put it out and it went to No.1\\".  Reception = Critical response  Nick Levine from Digital Spy said of the song when it first appeared online, \\"Truth be told, the track's a pretty standard sexy electro-R&B; jam, but the Lola persona is reasonably intriguing, even if it does have a hint of the Sasha Fierce to it. It's very much a case of wait and see what happens next, we suppose.\\" Elena Gorgan of Softpedia made similar comments. saying that \\"Of course, there is little substance to the lyrics of 'Fresh Out the Oven' but, critics say, substance is perhaps the last thing Lopez needs right now if she wants to regain her well-deserved first position in the charts, especially in the light of her latest not too brilliant releases. As far as the song is concerned, it‚Äôs written to make the listener want to get to the dancefloor and move to the beat, they say. Because of this, if accompanied by a good video with awesome choreography ‚Äì the kind Lopez knows how to do so well ‚Äì and enough promotion, this could turn into a massive hit on all fronts.\\" DJ Booth said of the song: \\"I give you Jennifer Lopez (or Lola, as she now wants to be called). Coming off an extended wedding/pregnancy hiatus from the music community, Lola is now toting sexy around like an expensive fashion accessory. For her welcome-back single, Lola joins forces with fellow Latino Pitbull over a typically synth-driven Pharrell beat to show the world that even though she‚Äôs years removed from the peak of her career, she‚Äôs still 'Fresh out the Oven'.\\" Ryan Brockington of the New York Post gave a positive review of the song, saying it has a \\"tight, sassy, radio friendly sound\\". He continued by stating that: \\"The track's surprising hottness could be because she not only tapped Pitbull to appear but she also had hit-makers the Neptunes produce the puppy\\".  Commercial performance  The song charted in mid-November 2009, but went unnoticed until the week of December 12, 2009 when the song shot up the U.S. Hot Dance Club Songs to number 14. After nine weeks, it reached a new peak of number two. In its tenth week on the chart, it reached number one making it Lopez's third consecutive number one (seventh overall) dance hit following in the footsteps of 2007's \\"Do It Well\\" and 2008's \\"Hold It Don't Drop It\\". In its eleventh week, the song fell down the chart to number ten. In its twelfth week the song fell another two places to number 12, whilst in its thirteenth week on the chart it fell another three places to 15, with further descents in the subsequent weeks. According to Billboard the song failed to chart on any of the U.S. airplay charts. \\"Fresh Out the Oven\\" finished in tenth place on the Billboard Hot Dance Club Songs year-end chart of 2010.  Promotion  In October 2009, a Twitter account, MySpace page and teaser website, all in the name of Lola, were set up. They all featured a dancing female figure named Lola. Rumors surfaced that Lopez had adopted Lola, as her alter-ego, however, this was confirmed as false by the president of Epic Records, Amanda Ghost. She said: \\"It's something fun. She hasn't become Sasha Fierce (Beyonc√© Knowles' artistic alter ego). There won't be anything to do with Lola on her Love? album. This is a hot club record that the label loved and Jennifer thought was fun, Jennifer and Pitbull got together and the record leaked. Lola is a fun character just for this song\\". Lopez was in attendance at the LIV Nightclub in Miami on October 24, 2009, where the music video for \\"Fresh Out the Oven\\" was previewed. The video premiered on Lopez's official website on November 20, 2009. The clip was directed by Jonas Akerlund and according to Lopez's official website its formally titled: \\"Fresh Out the Oven\\" starring Jennifer Lopez as Lola & featuring Pitbull. The unrated director's cut was uploaded on director Jonas Akerlund‚Äôs official website in January 2010. The video makes use of repetitious images for a hypnotic effect, and avoids showing any of the actors' faces until the final act.

Six Catholic civilians, three in Arnon Street, were shot dead. It is believed that members of either the Ulster Special Constabulary (USC) or of the Royal Irish Constabulary (RIC) were responsible, acting in retaliation for the killing of an RIC officer by the Irish Republican Army (IRA)., \\"The murder gang struck again after an RIC Constable, George Turner, was gunned down on the Old Lodge Road.\\", \\"the shooting of a Brown Square Barracks-based RIC officer, George Turner...sparked the grisly events which were to occur in north Belfast early the next morning.\\" Background Although the Irish War of Independence officially ended in July 1921, the Irish Republican Army's conflict with British and unionist forces continued in Northern Ireland and escalated in the first half of 1922. The Ulster IRA, with the tacit but covert assistance of Michael Collins (head of the new Irish Free State) continued to wage a guerrilla war in Northern Ireland. According to historian Alan Parkinson, despite \\"the IRA having some short term successes ... the main effect of this intensive campaign was to unleash a terrible backlash on the Catholic population in Belfast\\".. Only a week before the Arnon Street incident, policemen ‚Äì either Royal Irish Constabulary (RIC) or Ulster Special Constabulary (USC) ‚Äì had killed six Catholic civilians in the McMahon murders. On the evening of 1 April an RIC constable, George Turner, was patrolling the Old Lodge Road, when he was killed by a sniper. The killings About ten police officers in Brown Square Barracks, upon hearing of Turner's murder, took a Lancia armoured car and went touring nationalist areas. When they dismounted their vehicle, witnesses heard them shouting \\"Cut the guts out of them for the murder of Turner\\".. Their first victim was John McRory (40) who lived on Stanhope Street, just across the road from where Constable Turner had been shot. The police broke into his house and shot him dead in his kitchen. In Park Street, Bernard McKenna (42), father of seven, was killed while lying in bed. Finally, the police arrived at Arnon Street.. William Spallen (70) lived at 16 Arnon street and had just returned from the funeral of his wife (who had also been killed in the conflict). His 12-year-old grandson, Gerald Tumelty, witnessed his death: \\"Two men came into the room, one was in the uniform of a policeman. They asked my grandfather his name and he said William Spallen. The man in plain clothes fired three shots at him. When I cried out he said \\"lie down or I will put a bullet into you\\".. Tumelty said the killers then took ¬£20 that his grandfather had to pay for his wife's funeral. The attackers then used a sledgehammer to break into the house next door, where they found Joseph Walsh (39) in bed with his seven-year-old son Michael and his two-year-old daughter Bridget. Joseph Walsh was bludgeoned to death with the sledgehammer while Michael Walsh was shot and died from his wounds the next day.. Another son, Frank (14), was shot in the thigh but survived. A local man, George Murray, described the aftermath of the attack: \\"One of the three policemen had revolvers and the other two had guns. These men went out. Immediately after, seven armed men ‚Äì five in police uniform and two in civilians clothes ‚Äì entered\\". Later that evening, another Catholic, John Mallon (60), was shot dead in Skegoneill Avenue. Aftermath The unionist press, the Belfast Newsletter and Belfast Telegraph, condemned the killings but did not identify the killers as police. The Dublin-based Irish Independent wrote that \\"never even in the worst state of terror in the west and south has the state of affairs which now prevails in the Northern capital been experienced.\\". Michael Collins sent an angry telegram to Northern Ireland Prime Minister James Craig, demanding a joint inquiry into the killings. No such inquiry was set up. As with the McMahon killings one week earlier, it was strongly suspected that an RIC Detective Inspector, John William Nixon, operating out of the Brown Street Police barracks, had organised the attack. Nixon and several other policemen failed to turn up at roll call at the barracks immediately after the killings.. According to Irish historical writer Tim Pat Coogan, \\"in the atmosphere of the time neither Craig nor the British could or would prosecute or investigate such men without risk of a serious backlash amongst the Specials [Special Constabulary]\\". According to Parkinson, \\"the raw sectarianism of many violent acts during this period were not confined to large scale incidents such as the Arnon Street or the McMahon murders, nor indeed to any one political or religious group\\".. For instance, the day before the Arnon street killings, IRA members threw a grenade though the window of the house of Protestant Francis Donnelly, killing his two-year- old son Frank and mortally wounding another son, Joseph (12). According to historian Robert Lynch's count, a total of 465 people died in Belfast in the conflict of 1920‚Äì22, and a further 1,091 were wounded. Of the dead, 159 were Protestant civilians, 258 Catholic were civilians, 35 were British forces and 12 were IRA volunteers..

Ilfochrome print ‚Äì by Akim Monet Biography Akim Monet was born in Geneva and studied comparative literature and art history at Cornell University, New York State. The subject of his thesis: Reading of Camus‚Äô ¬´L‚ÄôEtranger¬ª across the work of Yves Klein. Monet has been showing his work publicly since 2002. He has had several solo exhibitions of which ‚ÄúPassage to India‚Äù in New York and Mexico City, ‚ÄúHomage to Gaudi‚Äù in Geneva and Belgium, and ‚ÄúPergamon‚Äù in Paris. Monet's work is on public display at the Deutsche Bank Collection in New York. Akim Monet also writes about art (see Paula Cooper Gallery - New York and Barbara Gladstone Gallery - New York). Work ‚ÄúIt was in India, in 1992, that Akim Monet began his photographic investigation of historical treasures. Absorbing the particulars of the region, he was deeply affected by the power of the ancient temples and monuments that are still a vital part of daily life there. He used photography as a way of processing what he was feeling. Having accumulated a trove of images, he found looking at the negative strips more akin to his actual experience of the places and became obsessed with the instant when the shutter clicks open and the emulsion on the celluloid reacts to the sudden onslaught of light; with the magic that occurs at that micro-moment around 1/100th of a second when light hits the negative. The tiny images on the negative strips seemed to burn: stone was transformed into molten lava and shadow became light. With no formal training in photography, Monet developed a process by which the final prints match the original negatives. In New York, seven years after India, he learned how to use digital printing technology to achieve glorious high-resolution prints of his negatives at a grand scale. All the details in a scene are imprinted on a negative. Monet sees a positive print as a reproduction, and a negative as the imprint of reality, the testimony of a microsecond. He is fascinated by the manner in which negatives reveal what the eye cannot see, the complement of what the eye does see. He marvels how black is the absence of light and white the sum of all colors. He tries to see how light travels through space and hits an object: some rays are absorbed and others reflected. The latter are those that allow us to see color; it is those that affect the emulsion on the celluloid. In India, he discovered the ‚Äúspace between‚Äù: that space between the Ying and the Yang, that space between the sum of all colors and its absence. He saw this space in his negatives and found a way to enlarge them in order to explore this enchanted gap. Monet used the same rendering process for the following projects and, in 2003, he published a book entitled The space between including three different body of works: ‚ÄúPassage to India‚Äù, ‚ÄúHomage to Gaud√≠‚Äù and ‚ÄúExotic Flowers‚Äù.‚ÄùSheets, Hilarie M., excerpt from the book \\"The Space between\\" (2003) Liz Christensen, Curator at the Deutsche Bank Fine Art Program said about his work: \\"Fascinated by the moment captured by the opening and closing of the shutter ‚Äì creating what the artist calls the ‚Äúburn‚Äù of the image ‚Äì Monet's photographs conjure a mystery and beauty akin to alchemy.\\"Christensen, Liz ‚Äì Exhibition catalogue ‚ÄúPassage to India‚Äù Carosso Fine Art, NY, 2002 Photographic Projects 1992 Passage to India ‚ÄúMy fellow artist Akim Monet invited me to lunch at his home in New York City. As I entered his dining room, I was immediately struck by several large scale photographs of India. Their saturated colors emanating ethereal light beckoned me to look closer. I felt the spirituality of India, standing there with the afternoon light streaming through the windows, highlighting the details in Monet‚Äôs images. The solarized effect of the print adds to the sense of otherworldliness and reminds me of an x-ray‚Äîallowing the viewer a view within and an understanding of a Passage to India. Akim Monet is a true visionary in more ways than one‚Äù. (Andres Serrano, Artist).Serrano, Andres, foreword excerpt from the book The Space between (2003) \\"One of the strongest images was the Taj Mahal (1992). The building, shot from a distance and mirrored in the long reflecting pool before it, is pale and ghostly, seeming to hover like a mirage against a moody burnt orange sky. Only after trying to make sense of the pictorial space does it become clear that Monet actually turned the picture upside down, further playing with the idea of negative and positive. He seems drawn to the dual nature of India, finding the spiritual and carnal at its roots\\". (Hilarie M. Sheets)Sheets, Hilarie M., \\"Akim Monet\\" Art News Volume 101/Number 9 (October 2002): 160 In addition to being review in ARTnews by Hilarie M. Sheets (excerpt above), the 1992 exhibition \\"Passage to India\\" was also short-listed by Vince AlettiAletti, Vince, ‚ÄúAkim Monet. Large scale color images of Indian sculpture‚Äù, The Village Voice, June 25, 2002, Photo, p. 96 in The Village Voice. 2000 Homage to Gaud√≠ \\"Homage to Gaud√≠\\" explores the interface of architecture and nature, inside and outside. The architect‚Äôs undulating, flourishing edifices -walls, caves, gates, towers- are so organic, it‚Äôs hard to tell where the manmade stops and nature takes up, particularly when rendered in Monet‚Äôs inside-out palette. Monet also focuses more here on the kind of cropping and composing devices inherent in photography, making two towers shot from above seem so reduced in scale they look like side-by-side bowling pins, and framing them inside a rugged vertical opening in an image he says is an homage to a Barnett Newman \\"zip\\" painting. Another in the series shows a pigeon sitting on a balcony encrusted with dazzling floral mosaics, juxtaposed with actual nature beyond that has the ethereal quality of an Impressionist landscape dissolving into dappled paint. 2001 Exotic Flowers The idea with \\"Exotic Flowers\\", as Monet explains, was to go back to square one, and just as a painter learns the rudiments of making still lifes and portraits, so too would he return to the basics. Again dichotomy plays a powerful role in Monet's gorgeous pictures taken in Bali of wild growth not seen on this side of the equator as well as of transvestites negating their gender in New York‚Äôs yearly Wigstock festival. Conceptually, the two subjects hold together both in their fragility and lavish statement, and the same colors echo in each -the deep purple of the sunflower in one drag queen‚Äôs hair, for instance, is laced throughout the tropical plants. The hothouse effect of Monet's pictures speaks to a moment when the world feels on the verge of boiling over, where the same Balinese paradise that he photographed was subsequently bombed by terrorists. Part of the beauty and intensity of these photographs has to do with the convergence of opposites, of past and present. They stand sublimely poised in the space between. 2004 Pergamon \\"To look at Akim Monet's photographs of Greek sculptures is to experience these familiar objects of near perfection in an unexpected light. Cropped from the context of the Pergamon Museum in Berlin and delivered to a pictorial world of lush blue tonalities, these stone gods and humans enacting their timeless postures take on a taut psychological currency. Monet's signature process of printing directly what is on his negatives rather than inverting them into positive images is what gives all his photographs their saturated, heightened palette. In the \\"Pergamon\\" series, his technique renders hard, cold stone fluid and aqueous. Whether by highlighting elements of abstraction or teasing out moments of human drama, Monet's images bring into relief a contemporary relevancy he finds in these classical sculptures. The idea of duality plays out even in the presentation of these Ilfochrome prints, which are two dimensional but assume the heft of stone under their boxlike lamination of thick polished Plexiglas, a nod to minimalist sculpture. In a subtle dialogue among mediums, Monet approaches his three-dimensional subjects from a painterly sensibility and returns the traces of light stolen with his camera back to the object world. In a subtle dialogue among mediums, Monet approaches his three-dimensional subjects from a painterly sensibility and returns the traces of light stolen with his camera back to the object world.\\"Sheets, Hilarie M., excerpt from the catalogue \\"Pergamon\\" (2004) 2004 Domus Adriani The series Domvs Adriani was captured in 2004 at Hadrian's Villa, Tivoli, Italy, a UNESCO World Heritage Site that has inspired many artists including Italian master engraver Giovanni Battista Piranesi. The complex of over 30 buildings was created as a retreat from Rome for Emperor Hadrian early in the 2nd century AD. Hadrian's Villa was the greatest Roman example of an Alexandrian garden, the recreation of a sacred landscape. It included a pool and an artificial grotto that were named Canopus and Serapeum. Canopus was an Egyptian city where a temple (Serapeum) was dedicated to the god Serapi. The architecture is Greek influenced (typical in Roman architecture of the High and Late Empire) as seen in the Corinthian columns and the copies of famous Greek statues that surround the pools. 2006 In the Vatican Gardens ‚Ä≥Beauty, forever analyzed, theorized and above all experienced by who loves art, acquires a new expression and a personal dimension through the works of Akim Monet. The traces of our past are promoted by Monet: works, sculptures, buildings, environments of the Italian artistic culture are exalted through the strength of forms and dynamics of individual gestures, which projected in the future, seem to resist indelibly to time. Delicate and elegant chromatics, plays of light, colors and shadows induce the viewer to ponder about the meaning of beauty, giving a new light to antiquities, through which knowledge merges with artistic consciousness‚Ä≥. (Claudio Fortugno).Associazione culturale Benclaro 2009 Rodin. A photographic engagement ‚Ä≥Early in 2009 I was invited to take photographs at the Mus√©e Rodin on a Monday when the museum is closed to the public. I was allowed to wander freely through the rooms and I became engulfed in the world of the master. I discovered a medieval Rodin; gothic, but strangely inviting because the emotions that are played out are familiar, as much on the faces as in the postures, because they belong to humanity ‚Äì Rodin appropriates them and gives them back to us; he defies time in a vertiginous manner. I discovered his love scenes, or rather the carnal encounters so dear to Rodin. I was stunned when I exited the museum. On that day I was invited to commune with the work of the sculptor who for me incarnates the notion of engagement ‚Äì in the past, but also in the future ‚Äì in life and in the yonder, in brief the engagement in the study of the human condition‚Ä≥. Akim Monet Selected exhibitions Monet had his first solo show: 'Passage to India' (2002) at Carosso, LLC Fine Arts, New York; two years later two solo exhibitions: 'Homage to Gaudi' at 5, rue de la Muse Gallery, Geneva and at Maruani & Noirhomme Gallery, Knokke, Belgium. In 2005 Monet had another solo exhibition, 'Pergamon' at the Galerie du XXe Si√®cle in Paris, France. Between 2002 and 2007, the artist took part in several group shows in Mexico City, Bruxelles, Paris and Milan. Artist Residency In 2005, Akim Monet was invited by the University of Maine New Media Program to be their \\"artist in residence\\". They commissioned him to make a multimedia \\"video installation\\", 'Caves a meditation' Caves a meditation with the students there. The artist chose to make a film based on a photographic series he shot the previous year \\"The Caves\\". These are a group of photographs taken in one of the most beautiful ancient grottoes in Europe. During millions of years, a powerful river eroded strata of limestone into a surrealist landscape. The Stalactites and stalagmites inhabit this space; they stand in time like actors in the set of nature. Although there are no images of water among the photos of \\"The Caves‚Äù, the grottoes were carved by water. Water for the grottoes acts as the negatives do for images; water is the catalyst for the carvings. Because the pictures are rendered in negative they have a marvelous blue watery hue. Monet \\"saw\\" a projected piece made of the images, accompanied by different sounds of water. Public Collection In 2004 Deutsche Bank Collection in New York acquired three of Akim Monet's large-scale works.  Berlin Gallery  In 2011 Monet opened a Gallery in Berlin at Potsdamer Str. 81b.

Lankester Harding: An Appreciation\\", The Jordan Times 15 February 1979, p. 3 ‚Äì 11 February 1979) was a British archaeologist who was the director of the Department of Antiquities of Jordan from 1936 to 1956. His tenure spanned the period in which the Dead Sea Scrolls were discovered and brought to public awareness. Without his efforts many of the scrolls might have disappeared into private collections never to be seen again. Life Harding was born in Tientsin, North China in 1901, but spent his childhood from age two to 13 in Singapore. He returned to the UK with his parents in 1913, but his father was killed in World War I, and Harding earned his living in a number of jobs from the ages of 16 to 25. During this time, he became fascinated by Egyptian hieroglyphics and eventually joined the evening classes run by the distinguished Egyptologist Dr Margaret Murray. Recognising his brilliance, she encouraged him to write to Sir Flinders Petrie and apply to go on one of his excavations. In 1926, Petrie was excavating at Tell Jemmeh, near Gaza in southern Palestine, where Harding joined him. Harding's archaeological talents quickly became apparent and with James Leslie Starkey and Olga Tufnell, he became one of a band of young archaeologists known as 'Petrie's pups'.Drower, 1985 While on the excavations, he quickly learned spoken Arabic from the local Bedouin and spoke their dialect throughout his life despite living in Amman and Lebanon in later years. He also taught himself written Arabic. Harding and the other 'pups' worked with Petrie at Tell Jemmeh, Tell Fara and Tall al-Ajjul between 1926 and 1931, but in 1932 they began a major excavation of their own, under Starkey's direction, at Tell ed-Duweir (Biblical Lachish), where the famous \\"Lachish Letters\\", written in the Palaeo-Hebrew script on pot sherds were found. With Olga Tufnell and Charles Inge, Harding was responsible for the second volume of the Final Report. In 1936, Harding was appointed by the British Mandate government as chief inspector of Antiquities to succeed George Horsfield.Harding 1959, xiii With the help of his Bedouin assistant Hasan Awad who was also a superb archaeologist, Harding revitalised the Department of Antiquities and set about exploring, photographing, and cataloguing the sites and antiquities of Jordan. His photographs and meticulous records still are held by the department and record much that has since disappeared. As well as conducting a large number of excavations and surveys, he drew up a set of archaeological maps of Jordan, founded the Archaeological Museum on the citadel in Amman, and in 1951 set up the journal The Annual of the Department of Antiquities of Jordan, which still is in existence. Harding was very conscious of the need to establish a cadre of young Jordanian archaeologists to succeed him, and over a long period pestered first the Mandate and then the independent Jordanian government to provide funds for Jordanian students to study abroad because, at that time, there were no universities in Jordan. He managed to achieve funding for one student to go to the Institute of Archaeology, University of London but unfortunately the student having finished his course took a job in the UK, and after this the governments in Jordan were unwilling to pay for others to study archaeology abroad. In 1948, Harding learned of the existence of the Dead Sea Scrolls from a report in an archaeological journal. As they were found in his jurisdiction, he immediately set out to rescue as many of them as possible and to discover their archaeological context in order to preserve the important information they might yield. In his capacity as acting curator of the Palestine Archaeological Museum (now the Rockefeller Museum) in Jerusalem, he used that institution to aid in the search for the origin of the scrolls. Working with the American School of Oriental Research and the √âcole biblique et arch√©ologique fran√ßaise in Jerusalem, he negotiated access to the scrolls and their point of origin, and he organized funding to purchase them from the Bedouin who originally found them.Allegro 1956, pp. 20‚Äì22, 32‚Äì34. With P√®re Roland de Vaux, Harding then organized a panel of brilliant young scholars to work on the scrolls, including Josef Milik, John Strugnell, and John Allegro. In 1948, Harding and de Vaux finally learned the location of the cave from which the scrolls had come, and together they excavated it.VanderKam 2002, p. 12. Subsequently, they investigated the settlement site of Qumran and examined two tombs in the Qumran Cemetery. In February 1952, he was involved with de Vaux in the excavation of caves in Wadi Murabba'at.Allegro 1956, p. 35. Harding continued to oversee the matters regarding Qumran and the scrolls until 1956 when the Suez Crisis occurred, he together with John Bagot Glubb (Glubb Pasha) and all the remaining British officials were dismissed by the Jordanian government. Harding moved to Lebanon where he lived for the next 20 years. At some point, Harding met the American author William Peter Blatty in Beirut, and Blatty has stated that Harding \\"was the physical model in my mind when I created the character of Father Merrin [from The Exorcist], whose first name, please note, is Lankester.\\"http://www.theninthconfiguration.com/2009/ In 1959, Harding published The Antiquities of Jordan, an overview of the many and varied archaeological sites of Jordan, which includes a chapter on Qumran, and which remained the most popular guidebook to Jordan for several decades. The same year, Harding was asked by the British government to conduct the first major archaeological survey in the Aden Protectorate (southern Yemen). This he did and published his results in his book Archaeology in the Aden Protectorate. He also helped to set up and organise the Aden Museum and to secure for it and catalog the famous Muncherjee collection of ancient South Arabian antiquities. In the late 1940s, Harding had become interested in the Ancient North Arabian inscriptions of which there are many thousands in Jordan. After 1956, he devoted his considerable energies to publishing several thousands of them. In 1971, he produced An Index to the Concordance of Pre-Islamic Names and Inscriptions, a massive work which is used universally by those working on Ancient North and South Arabian inscriptions. Harding died in London, where he had been sent for medical treatment. However, as a mark of respect for the service he had given to the Hashemite Kingdom of Jordan, his ashes were returned to Jordan and by permission of the authorities were buried overlooking the archaeological site at Jerash.

She became the First Lady of Rwanda when her husband took office as President in 2000. The couple have four children - Ivan, Ange, Ian and Brian. Kagame is the Founder and Chairman of Imbuto Foundation, a non- profit organization whose mission is to support the development of a healthy, educated and prosperous society. Activism Jeannette Kagame returned to her native Rwanda following the Rwandan genocide of 1994. She has since become devoted to uplifting the lives of vulnerable population in Rwanda, particularly those of widows, orphans and impoverished families. Kagame hosted the first African First Ladies‚Äô Summit on Children and HIV/AIDS Prevention in May 2001 in Kigali, Rwanda. The summit lead to the founding of the PACFA (Protection and Care of Families against HIV/AIDS). an initiative primarily focused on providing a holistic approach to HIV prevention and care for the whole family. Kagame later co-founded the Organisation of African First Ladies against HIV/AIDS (OAFLA) in 2002, and served as its president from 2004 until 2006. Over the years, PACFA grew to include projects other than those in the HIV/AIDS domain and in 2007 Imbuto Foundation - which means ‚Äúseed‚Äù in Kinyarwanda - was established. The Foundation implements various projects such as: extending basic care and economic support to HIV affected families; enhancing knowledge and changing attitudes towards adolescent sexual and reproductive health; protecting youth against HIV/AIDS; malaria prevention; motivating girls to excel in school; providing scholarships to disadvantaged youth; promoting a reading culture; mentoring and equipping youth with entrepreneurial and leadership skills. The First Lady is also a patron of the Rotary Club Virunga, based in Kigali, which established the first public library in Rwanda in 2012. Mrs. Kagame is also a member of the board of directors for several organizations, including the Global Coalition of Women against HIV/AIDS and the Friends of the Global Fund Africa. In 2010, Kagame received an Honorary Doctor of Laws from Oklahoma Christian University for her contribution to the worldwide fight against HIV/AIDS and poverty. In the same year, she was appointed Special Representative on Child Nutrition by the World Food Program (WFP). In 2009, UNICEF presented the Children‚Äôs Champions Award to President Paul Kagame and First Lady Jeannette Kagame in recognition of their efforts at improving the lives of children in Rwanda. In 2007, World Health Organization (WHO) appointed her the High Representative of the Africa AIDS Vaccine Program (AAVP), to ensure the active participation of African stakeholders in all areas of HIV and AIDS vaccine research and development. Kagame holds a degree in Business and Management Science.

The process of drug manufacturing can be broken down into a series of unit operations, such as milling, granulation, coating, tablet pressing, and others. Scale-up Considerations =Cooling While a laboratory may use dry ice as a cooling agent for reaction selectivity, this process gets complicated on an industrial scale. The cost to cool a typical reactor to this temperature is large, and the viscosity of the reagents typically also increases as the temperature lowers, leading to difficult mixing. This results in added costs to stir harder and replace parts more often, or it results in a non- homogeneous reaction. Finally, lower temperatures can result in crusting of reagents, intermediates, and byproducts to the reaction vessel over time, which will impact the purity of the product. Stoichiometry Different stoichiometric ratios of reagents can result in different ratios of products formed. On the industrial scale, adding a large amount of reagent A to reagent B may take time. During this, the reagent A that is added is exposed to a much higher stoichiometric amount of reagent B until it is all added, and this imbalance can lead to reagent A prematurely reacting, and subsequent products to also react with the huge excess of reagent B. Solvent Extractions Whether to add organic solvent into aqueous solvent, or vice versa, becomes important on the industrial scale. Depending on your solvents, emulsions can form, and the time for your layers to separate can be extended if the mixing between solvents is not optimal. When adding organic solvent to aqueous, stoichiometry must be considered again as the excess of water could hydrolyze organic compounds in only mildly acid base conditions. In an even wider scope, the location of your chemical plant can play a role in the ambient temperature of your reaction vessel. A difference of even a couple of degrees can yield much different levels of extractions between plants located across countries. Unit operations=Formulation and pre-formulation development Powder feeding in continuous manufacturing  In continuous manufacturing, input raw materials and energy are fed into the system at a constant rate, and at the same time, a constant extraction of output products is achieved. The process performance is heavily dependent on stability of the material flowrate. For powder-based continuous processes, it is critical to feed powders consistently and accurately into subsequent unit operations of the process line, as feeding is typically the first unit operation. Feeders have been designed to achieve performance reliability, feed rate accuracy, and minimal disturbances. Accurate and consistent delivery of materials by well- designed feeders ensures overall process stability. Loss-in-weight (LIW) feeders are selected for pharmaceutical manufacturing. Loss-in-weight (LIW) feeders control material dispensing by weight at a precise rate, and are often selected to minimize the flowrate variability that is caused by change of fill level and material bulk density. Importantly, feeding performance is strongly dependent on powder flow properties. Powder blending In the pharmaceutical industry, a wide range of excipients may be blended together with the active pharmaceutical ingredient to create the final blend used to manufacture the solid dosage form. The range of materials that may be blended (excipients, API), presents a number of variables which must be addressed to achieve target product quality attributes. These variables may include the particle size distribution (including aggregates or lumps of material), particle shape (spheres, rods, cubes, plates, and irregular), presence of moisture (or other volatile compounds), particle surface properties (roughness, cohesion), and powder flow properties. Milling During the drug manufacturing process, milling is often required in order to reduce the average particle size in a drug powder. There are a number of reasons for this, including increasing homogeneity and dosage uniformity, increasing bioavailability, and increasing the solubility of the drug compound. In some cases, repeated powder blending followed by milling is conducted to improve the manufacturability of the blends. Granulation In general, there are two types of granulation: wet granulation and dry granulation. Granulation can be thought of as the opposite of milling; it is the process by which small particles are bound together to form larger particles, called granules. Granulation is used for several reasons. Granulation prevents the \\"demixing\\" of components in the mixture, by creating a granule which contains all of the components in their required proportions, improves flow characteristics of powders (because small particles do not flow well), and improves compaction properties for tablet formation. Hot melt extrusion Hot melt extrusion is utilized in pharmaceutical solid oral dose processing to enable delivery of drugs with poor solubility and bioavailability. Hot melt extrusion has been shown to molecularly disperse poorly soluble drugs in a polymer carrier increasing dissolution rates and bioavailability. The process involves the application of heat, pressure and agitation to mix materials together and 'extrude' them through a die. Twin-screw high shear extruders blend materials and simultaneously break up particles. The resulting particles can be blended and compressed into tablets or filled into capsules.

He was alderman of the City of Chicago, representing the 36th ward on the City's far northwest side, from 2009 to 2011. Political career Rice was a member of the 36th Ward Regular Democratic Organization, one of Alderman William Banks' (36th) political action committees. Career in government Rice worked for the Cook County Highway Department from 1991 to 1997. Rice had worked for the City of Chicago since October 1, 1997. Rice worked as a city zoning inspector from 1997 to 2005. Rice was a long-time employee of the Chicago City Council with a title of \\"Assistant to the Alderman,\\" working as a driver to Banks. Appointment to City Council In late April, 2009, Banks announced his intention to retire from City Council. Banks asked Mayor Richard M. Daley to appoint Rice as his replacement. Rice organizes retirement party for Banks While Rice was under consideration by Daley for appointment as alderman, Rice organized a $200-a-ticket retirement party for Banks at a Rosemont restaurant. Rice sent out invitations instructing those purchasing tickets to \\"make checks payable to William J. P. Banks (Memo -- Retirement Party)\\" and mail the checks to Rice's house. Days after a report in the Chicago Tribune, the party was cancelled. Appointment, confirmation, and swearing-in Daley announced the appointment of Rice, then 41, as the new 36th Ward alderman on Tuesday, October 6, 2009. The City Council unanimously approved the appointment the next day, Wednesday, October 7, 2009, and Daley swore in Rice. The appointment of Rice drew criticism from some in the local media. After Rice took office, he voted consistently in support of Mayor Daley's positions. On April 5, 2011, Chicago firefighter Nick Sposato defeated Rice with 56% of the vote, 5,629 to 4,378. \\"It's a sad day for the people of the 36th Ward, because the people have no idea what they just did to themselves,\\" Rice said.

The ADA engages with government through submissions, lobbying, and media activities. The ADA works closely with its sister organisation, the Australian Libraries Copyright Committee (ALCC). The ALCC is the main consultative body and policy forum for the discussion of copyright issues affecting Australian libraries. It develops policy and advocates action appropriate for the role of libraries as information providers and preservers in Australia. The two bodies share a copyright adviser, and generally make joint submissions to government.  IceTV Pty Ltd v Nine Network Australia Pty Ltd (2009)  The Nine Network sued IceTV for copyright infringement after IceTV used parts of Nine Network‚Äôs programme schedules for its electronic program guide. The case raised questions about the threshold of the originality requirement for copyright, and the nature of the protection for compilations (collections of facts) in Australia. The ADA was granted leave by the High Court of Australia to intervene as a friend of the court. The ADA‚Äôs submissions outlined the importance of public interest considerations and the implications that this case could have on copyright users. The High Court found in favour of IceTV, with the joint judgment of Gummow, Hayne and Heydon making reference to the ADA‚Äôs submissions.IceTV Pty Limited v Nine Network Australia Pty Limited [2009 HCA 14]. The High Court recognised the importance of maintaining a robust public domain which allows people and organisations to use, re-use and build on materials to produce innovative new works.  A User‚Äôs Guide to the Flexible Dealing Provision  Together with the ALCC, the ADA produced a handbook on the new flexible dealing provision of the Copyright Act (section 200AB). The handbook outlines how the provision operates and provides examples to assist libraries, archives, galleries and educational institutions to take advantage of the provision and use copyright materials. The formal launch of the handbook was attended by ADA members, senior public servants, and other copyright figures. The Flexible Dealing Handbook is available for free download under Creative Commons license.  Anti-Counterfeiting Trade Agreement  Significantly increased intermediary responsibility, among other things, is currently the subject of negotiations in the proposed Anti-Counterfeiting Trade Agreement (ACTA). The ADA encouraged greater transparency by the Department of Foreign Affairs and Trade (DFAT) regarding the progress of its negotiations. The ADA formed a coalition with other concerned organisations including Choice, the Australian Library and Information Association, and the Internet Industry Association. The coalition was involved in a number of government meetings, and submitted a joint statement of principles for ACTA negotiations to DFAT. The submission agreed that reducing counterfeiting is important where it endangers consumer health or safety, or constitutes commercial scale infringement. However, the coalition urged that pursuit of that goal should not threaten legitimate commercial, social, innovative and creative activities, the rights of consumers or the free flow of information. The coalition noted the current proposed treaty raised concerns with respect to transparency, increased customs search powers, increased penalties for IP infringement, and lack of due process.

He has played and toured for over 30 years with artists including Gram Parsons, Emmylou Harris, Charlie Louvin and Joe Sun. Neil was inducted into the International Steel Guitar Hall Of Fame on June 12, 2016.  Biography  Flanz was born and raised in Montreal, Quebec, Canada. His musical influences as a child included Jimmie Rodgers, Wilf Carter, Hawaiian music and the Grand Ole Opry radio broadcasts. He began playing guitar at the age of 13 when his parents bought him a flat top guitar; by the time he was 17, he had moved on to the steel guitar (a double-neck Fender Stringmaster) in order to more closely replicate the sounds he had heard on country records growing up. It was the song ‚ÄúSlowly‚Äù by Webb Pierce (with Bud Issacs on an early pedal steel guitar called a \\"tone changer\\") that convinced him to begin playing with pedals, and he approached steel guitarist George Essery in Montreal to modify his guitar with a pedal. His first job as a musician was with Cowboy Jack, a Montreal artist with several country music hits in French. During the ensuing years, he worked with various musicians in Montreal and began making albums of his own, including 1962's \\"Neil Flanz and his Nashville Steel\\", and 1964's \\"Get On The Star Route\\" (recorded in Toronto using an Emmons Stereo pedal steel guitar). The success of the two albums gained Neil considerable recognition, both in Canada and the United States. He toured in the Toronto area with Dusty King, and in Ontario with Jack Kingston and Gary Buck. At age 24, Flanz began the process of moving to Nashville, Tennessee. He worked in Montreal's \\"Country Palace\\" backing up many Nashville artists including Charlie Louvin of the famed Louvin Brothers duet, and after obtaining his green card, Neil finally moved to Nashville, where he worked and toured with Charlie Louvin, Jean Shepard, Billy Walker, Ray Pillow and many other Grand Ole Opry artists. He eventually connected with Nashville‚Äôs \\"The Kelly Rogers Breed\\" with a regular engagement at the \\"Broadway Barn\\" around the corner from the Grand Ole Opry. In 1973, Phil Kaufman contacted Neil to play a six-week tour with Gram Parsons and Emmylou Harris. The band was called \\"The Fallen Angels\\" and also featured Kyle Tullis on bass, N.D. Smart on drums and Jock Bartley on lead guitar. He cites the tour as one of the most exciting parts of his career, with \\"thousands of cheering young long haired fans being introduced to country for the first time ‚Ä¶ rushing up to the stage just to touch us. Gram's Live: 1973 was recorded in Long Island, New York, and prominently features Neil's steel playing. After the Parsons tour, Flanz returned to Nashville to rejoin the \\"Kelly Rogers Breed\\", which later changed its name to \\"Peppertree\\". In the following months, he also toured with Roy Drusky, returning to play in Nashville whenever possible. This eventually led to a regular engagement at the Deeman's Den (named after owner and singer Nancy Dee). His shows there regularly featured sit-ins by Little Jimmy Dickens, Faron Young, Johnny Paycheck, Webb Pierce, Jimmy Day, Buddy Emmons and Jimmy Bryant. Over the ensuing years, Neil spent time touring the country with various groups, including stops in Austin and Dallas, and a two-week stint introducing President Jimmy Carter on a primary tour in North Carolina. In 1980, Joe Sun called and offered Neil a job as his full-time pedal steel player. The band, called ‚ÄúShotgun‚Äù, rehearsed in Key West, FL for a month before beginning touring and playing in Nashville, at which time Joe asked the band to record with him in the studio as well. Living On Honky Tonk Time was the first album featuring the band, and the song \\"Bombed Boozed and Busted\\" climbed the top twenty of the country charts, and remained a juke box favorite. The band played on the Austin City Limits television show and made three trips to Europe, including shows at London's famed Wembley Stadium. The band also toured Stockholm, Zurich, Amsterdam, Germany, and Scotland. Two albums featuring Neil were recorded in Nashville for release in Germany on the Intercord label (German Wikipedia page: :de:Intercord) and a second album for Elektra Records was released called I Aint Honky Tonkin' No More. Flanz currently lives in Austin, Texas, where he plays regular shows with FingerPistol. He teaches all levels of pedal steel guitar, and in 1969 recorded an instruction album for the E9 tuning now available on CD with tab as well as a book entitled \\"The C 6th Chord Dictionary\\". Neil currently plays a double neck Emmons.  Sources  * Austin Chronicle Profile of Neil Flanz * Twenty Thousand Roads: The Ballad of Gram Parsons and His Cosmic American Music, David N.

Biography Sven Hugo Borg was born in Vinsl√∂v, Sk√•ne l√§n, Sweden. Early in his career, Borg was a secretary with the Swedish Consulate in Los Angeles. While working at the consulate he met the actress Greta Garbo who had recently arrived in Hollywood. Garbo asked Borg to be her interpreter for an upcoming movie to which he readily agreed. He served as Garbo‚Äôs interpreter from 1925 to 1929. After interpreting for Greta, Borg decided to pursue acting as a career. He had done some dramatic work on the Swedish stage. He continued to remain with the consulate until the late 1930s. Borg became much in demand during World War II Hollywood films, playing both Nazi officers and Scandinavian resistance fighters. Throughout his acting career, Borg was an actor who portrayed a wide range of many different characters, e.g. Sverre-King of Norway in The Crusades. Borg died in 1981 at the age of 84 in Los Angeles, California.  Filmography  * Rose-Marie (1928) .... Hudson * Let's Fall in Love (1933) .... Eric (uncredited) * I'll Love You Always (1935) ....

Lux and Willis Ray, the IACP project coordinators, to established an industrial arts curriculum concerned with the instructional representation of the structure of knowledge. They placed their work within the classification of praxiological knowledge, asserting that their quest was nothing less than to identify the knowledge base that underlies all practical and vocational arts subject areas. This joint project between Ohio State University and the University of Illinois was initiated in June, 1965. Course Content The IACP was designed for 7th and 8th grade junior high grade levels (before the middle school transition), and had two year-long courses, \\"The World of Construction\\" and \\"The World of Manufacturing\\" (McKnight and McKnight Publishers, 1970). The concept was based on the idea that there is virtually nothing that people use on a daily basis that is not either constructed or manufactured, and that children should be taught the basis of those technologies at an early age to prevent \\"technological illiteracy.\\" The World of Construction The World of Construction, commonly the 7th grade curriculum, taught students about how residential and commercial buildings are built. Students got a taste of woodworking, concrete, electrical and other construction trades. The final big project was to build a cross-section of a house in the traditional wood shop in the school. The World of Manufacturing In 8th grade, \\"The World of Manufacturing\\" was taught in the traditional metal shop of the school. Students learned about metal working crafts and trades, and as a culminating activity, set up an assembly line to create a number of items. (One of the items was a screwdriver, and whenever the students took them home, most of the screws in the school had been removed by the end of the day, causing maintenance headaches for caretakers.)

Built in 1920 to a standard plan and used as a school until 1969, it is the only surviving historic school building in the small rural community. It was listed on the National Register of Historic Places in 1992. Description and history The Roosevelt School building is set on the south side of Maine Route 161, about east of the St. John Bible Church in the northwestern part of the small community. It is a single-story wood-frame structure, which is roughly rectangular in plan, with a projection extending across much of its front (north-facing) facade, and a small gable- roofed entry porch in front of that. The main block has a hip roof, which is continued over this projection, and there is a shed-roof dormer. The projecting section houses vestibules, closets, and bathroom facilities, and the main space is divided into two classrooms. The interior, despite alterations, retains significant elements of the original school function, including blackboards (now painted), and relatively unmodified closets and bathrooms. In some places original door and window trim is still in place, as is tongue-and-groove vertical wainscoting. The school was built in 1920, to a plan that strongly resembles that of other rural Maine schools built around that time, and is the only school building known to survive from that period or earlier. It was designed with two classrooms, later modified to have a movable divider. It served as a school until 1969, and has most recently seen use as a private summer accommodation.

The present-day building opened on September 18, 1963, as Memorial Library. In 1987 it was renamed Hesburgh Library in honor of Rev. Theodore Hesburgh, C.S.C., who served as the university's president from 1952 to 1987. The library's exterior fa√ßade that faces the university's football stadium includes a large, by mural called The Word of Life, or more commonly known as Touchdown Jesus. As of 2009, the library ranked as the 61st largest collection among research universities in the United States with an estimated 3.39 million volumes. History=Early libraries Before the establishment of a library for students, students took the initiative to establish literary societies, that served as the source of literature and discussion of scholarly topics. The first one was the St. Aloysius Literary Society, which was founded in 1850 and six years later established the first student library. It was followed by the Aloysius Philodemics, the Philopatrians and the St Edwards Library Society. The first circulating library at Notre Dame was created in 1873 by President Rev. Augustus Lemonnier, and incorporate the previously existing student libraries. It was housed on the third floor of the Main Building and its first librarian was Jimmie Edwards, CSC. In 1879 the Main Building was destroyed by fire and 500 books were lost. After the Main Building was rebuilt, a new library was established with a budget of $500 and comprised 16,000 volumes. In 1888, during the golden jubilee of Fr. Edward Sorin, a new library was opened on the third floor. By 1900 it contained 52,000 books. In 1907 the university hired Florence Espy, a professional librarian, to catalog the collection. After the death of Edwards, Paul Foik, came to Notre Dame in 1912 and took over his positions; he pushed for the construction of a library building. A new building (the present-day Bond Hall) to house the library was built in 1917. It was dedicated during the 75th anniversary of the University, with President William Taft in attendance. By 1920 its collection reached 103,000 volumes. The Dewey Decimal Classification has been used to classify the library's holdings since 1929. Thematic collections were established in other buildings in subsequent decades. A separate engineering library opened in 1933, followed by a biology library in 1938, the Medieval Institute in 1946, and the Nieuwland science library for chemistry, physics, and mathematics in 1953. Current library In 1959 Father Theodore Hesburgh, the university's president, announced plans for construction of a new library. Ground was broken in 1961, with the Ellerbe Company of Saint Paul, Minnesota, as the project's architect. Construction took three years. Memorial Library officially opened on September 18, 1963. See also: The finished structure, which is tall, is built on a site that encompasses . The interior of has two lower floors that serve as a base for a narrower and nearly windowless 13-story tower capped with a smaller penthouse. Interior floors have few walls and are supported by bare columns to create a flexible space to arrange stacks of books. The size of the windows was minimized to reduce glare and avoid uneven light from the outside. The two lower floors feature a more extensive use of glass, as well as brick and tweed granite, while the upper floors are finished in Makato stone. The library's collection reached one million volumes in 1970 and surpassed 1.5 million volumes in 1986. In 1987 the library was renamed Hesburgh Library in honor of Fr. Hesburgh, the university's retiring president, who served as Notre Dame's president for thirty-five years (1952‚Äì1987). In his retirement, Hesburgh maintained an office on the library's thirteenth floor, overlooking the Main Quad.Hesburgh joined the Notre Dame faculty as an instructor in the religion department in 1945 and was named head of the school‚Äôs theology department in 1948. He was appointed as the university's executive vice president in 1949 and succeeded John J. Cavanaugh, C.S.C., as president in 1952. See See also: As of 2009, the library housed 3.39 million volumes. The Association of Research Libraries ranked it the 61st largest collection among research universities in the United States. In 2015 the university began major renovations to the library that will modernize its interior design. Word of Life/Touchdown Jesus mural The Word of Life mural The side of the library facing the stadium is covered with a mural called The Word of Life, more commonly known as Touchdown Jesus, that measures high and wide. History When the library opened in 1963, the mural had not yet been installed. American artist Millard Sheets was commissioned to create a work large enough to cover the entire side of the library facing Notre Dame's football stadium. Fr. Theodore Hesburgh suggested that the theme should be saints and scholars through the ages. The artwork cost $200,000 and was donated by Mr. and Mrs. Howard V. Phalin of Winnetka, Illinois. Installation took place in the spring of 1964; the dedication ceremony was held on May 7, 1964. The mural is composed of 324 panels. It consists of 81 different stones from 16 countries in 171 finishes that includes 46 granites and syenites, 10 gabbros and labradorites, 4 metamorphic gneisses, 12 serpentines, 4 crystalline marbles, and 5 limestones. Description The artwork depicts a procession of figures representing Christian saints, thinkers, teachers, and writers, a topic that connected to the idea of the library. Figures were selected from different centuries and places to convey the concept of the Catholic Church's historical continuity. At the top of the procession the central figure is the resurrected Jesus Christ, conceived as the great teacher and master, and the fountain of knowledge contained in the library. The artwork, which is titled Word of Life, is tall and wide. Nickname The mural's image of Jesus, visible from Notre Dame's football stadium, has arms raised in the same fashion as a referee signifying a touchdown. From this similarity came the mural's nickname, Touchdown Jesus.Why Irish eyes are smiling A stadium expansion partially obscures views of the mural from the field.

Runit is a reimplementation of the daemontools process supervision toolkit that runs on many Linux-based operating systems, as well as the macOS, *BSD, and Solaris operating systems. Runit features parallelization of the start up of system services, which can speed up the boot time of the operating system. Runit is an init daemon, so it is the direct or indirect ancestor of all other processes. It is the first process started during booting, and continues running until the system is shut down. Design Runit focuses on being a small, modular, and portable codebase. Runit is split into three stages: one time initialization, process supervision, and halting or rebooting. While the first and third stages must be adapted to the specific operating system they are running on, the second stage is portable across all POSIX compliant operating systems. The 3 stages can be configured through 3 executable files (they are usually shell scripts) named, respectively, 1, 2, and 3. Stage 2 usually invokes a binary named runsvdir, which is the process responsible for global daemon management: for every daemon it finds in a folder passed to it by argument, it then spawns an individual watchdog, each of those starts a daemon (and a logger service eventually associated to it) and restarts it if it dies. In case a daemon is added or removed, it kills the watchdog or starts a new one. Executable files with specific names are used to describe the various phases of the daemon's life (run, check, finish, ...), it can intercepts signals sent and run specific scripts if they exists, and named pipes are created to expose interfaces to control the daemon. Usage Runit can be used either as a drop-in replacement for sysvinit, or as a service supervisor with sysvinit as the parent PID1 process which runs processes specified by the inittab file. The RubyWorks stack of software able to run Ruby on Rails incorporated Runit into its suite. Runit is the default init system for Void and Artix Linux.

File:Cissus Quadrangualaris 12.JPGDevil's backbone in Thrissur, Kerala, India  Traditional medicine  Cissus quadrangularis has been used as a medicinal plant since antiquity. Cissus has been used in various Ayurvedic classical medicines to heal broken bones and injured ligaments and tendons. In siddha medicine it is considered a tonic and analgesic, and is believed to help heal broken bones, thus its name asthisamharaka (that which prevents the destruction of bones). The Assamese people and the Garo tribe of Meghalaya and Bangladesh have used C. quadrangularis for bone fracture.  Experimental studies  One preliminary clinical study found a benefit in weight reduction and an improvement in the symptoms associated with metabolic syndrome in obese patients who had been given C. quadrangularis supplements. Another study found a potential synergistic effect between C. quadrangularis and Irvingia gabonensis. A weight loss supplement containing Cissus quadrangularis and other ingredients including green tea, soy, selenium, chromium, and B vitamins was evaluated in an 8-week trial. The supplement helped reduce body weight by 4‚Äì8% (placebo 2.4%) a clinically significant weight loss. A paper published in the World Journal of Gastroenterology in October 2010, on conflicts of interest in alternative weight loss product research, noted that at least three studies supported the safety and effectiveness of CQ for weight loss, but \\"lack financial disclosures or funding sources, beyond mentioning that the CQ being tested was provided by\\" General Health Alliances, an herbal products manufacturer. The studies did not disclose that one of its authors was a chief scientific officer for GHA that holds a patent on a CQ product. C. quadrangularis has been studied for its effects in a rat model for osteoporosis. C. quadrangularis has been studied in animal models of bone fracture. Its bactericidal effects on Helicobacter pylori indicate a potential use for treating gastric ulcers in conjunction with NSAID therapy.  Chemistry  C. quadrangularis has been found to contain carotenoids, triterpenoids, and ascorbic acid. The plant also produces the resveratrol dimer quadrangularin A.

The documentary initially began as a 10-minute short film co-directed by an autistic teenager named Taylor Cross, and his mother Keri Bowers. Joey Travolta first met Cross at a program Travolta led teaching the art of filmmaking to children with special needs. He helped educate Cross about filmmaking, and the documentary was expanded into a feature-length film. It includes interviews with 65 people, including those who are autistic as well as friends and family. Cross asks them about their experiences with autism and how they feel about it, and elicits multiple insightful responses from his subjects. The short version of the film was shown at a student film festival at Chaminade High School in West Hills, California in April 2004, and co-director Cross won multiple awards at the festival. In November 2004, Cross was honored for his work on the film, at a gala benefit dinner for the Bubel-Aiken Foundation in Los Angeles, California; the foundation's co-creator is Clay Aiken of American Idol. The feature-length version of the film was released on April 1, 2006. Special screenings included the Hot Springs Documentary Film Festival in October 2006, and the Staten Island Film Festival in 2007. The documentary received positive reception in the Daily News of Los Angeles, New York Daily News and the Tri-Valley Herald. Contents The documentary's purpose is to educate the public to gain an understanding of autism. Taylor Cross interviews autistic boys and girls between the ages of 9 to 19, and asks them to describe their perspective on the world and to share their thoughts. The youngest autistic child to appear in the film is a boy named Ricky, and the oldest at age 19 shares the same name as the co-director, Taylor. An autistic boy named Brian appears in the film and voices frustration due to experiencing teasing from girls at his school. Brian's sister Elizabeth also appears in the film ‚Äì she communicates with her brother in a language only the two of them comprehend. Cross also interviews parents of children with autism, including surfer Izzy Paskowitz. In addition, Cross interviews the dean of the film program at New York University. Cross asks subjects in the film: \\"Do you like having autism?\\". One middle school girl responds \\"I feel okay. It makes things hard for me that might be easy for others.\\" A little boy tells Cross: \\"Everyone's good at their own things.\\" An autistic woman tells Cross \\"Yes, I do. Because why should I not--why should I feel bad about something I can't really change? I might as well look at the good things about it.\\" Another boy says to Cross \\"I don't like being autistic\\", and when Cross asks why, the boy responds: \\"Because it's hard for me to have changes and all the other stuff.\\" A woman states to Cross of her experiences with autism: \\"I cry, I scream, I wish to God I wasn't different and I didn't have to struggle with everything ...\\", and a boy tells him of the negative aspects of the condition: \\"The bad thing about autism is that it gets hard to understand other people and to understand what people say and what--what other people try to tell me to do and how to explain me better.\\" When Cross asks his subjects \\"Tell me how you feel about having autism\\", he elicits responses including: \\"I have first thought, because people don't understand me\\", \\"Over the years I have come to accept it as a part of who I am. When I was younger I wanted to go away\\" and \\"It is not the biggest part of my life but knowing that I have something that makes me a little different, it sometimes makes me question myself\\". He also poses a question to the interviewees related to the film's title, and asks \\"Sometimes normal people are scary to kids with autism. They talk funny or too fast. Do normal people ever scare you?\\" Responses include \\"All the time\\", \\"Yes, because it is hard to keep up when people are talking\\", \\"Not really\\", \\"Yes. They do\\" and \\"A little, yes\\". Cross poses the question to those with autism: \\"What is normal anyway?\\". Cross interviews autistic students in the film and asks them to cite the most difficult things about their condition. Answers include \\"making friends\\" and \\"making people not hate you\\". All students acknowledge to Cross in the interviews that they have been teased for being different from others. Production Taylor Cross, the film's co-director, was diagnosed with autism at the age of six. He is a high-functioning autistic. His mother is co- director Keri Bowers. Though Bowers was known internationally as an authority on the subject, she encountered challenges in dealing with her son's condition. Cross decided to make a documentary about autism when he was fourteen-years-old, in order to help others understand his challenges. In total, Taylor Cross interviewed 65 people with autism about their perspectives on the condition. Most of those interviewed in the film were fellow students of Cross's from Newbury Park High School. The idea for the name of the film came to Cross from a T-shirt at a novelty store that had the phrase \\"Normal People Scare Me\\" printed on it. \\"I thought it was absolutely perfect,\\" said Cross of the phrase he saw on the T-shirt. In an appearance on Sunday Today, Cross explained to Campbell Brown: \\"Yeah, I was thinking I--it actually just came off a T-shirt that I read, which totally makes sense either way because the real underlying message, if--if you've noticed it, even I haven't noticed it until like recently, like the whole underlying message is \`What is normal anyway?' I mean, that just kind of gives it off in the title.\\" Prior to the longer version, the documentary began as a 10-minute film. \\"I was told by the doctors that my son would probably never walk or talk. Today's he's a high school freshman enrolled in regular classes, who wants to go to college and become a filmmaker,\\" Keri Bowers said of her son. Cross told the Daily News of Los Angeles: \\"I want people to leave my film feeling uplifted and having a better understanding of what it's like to live in our world.\\" The feature- length version of the film includes interviews with family members and friends of children with autism. Cross said work on the documentary was difficult: \\"It was long, and it was tedious. I swear on my grave that I'm not doing another documentary. It took two years to finish.\\" During the film's production, Cross and Bowers appeared on a program hosted by Paula Zahn on CNN to discuss their work. Taylor Dayne was a singer for a musical piece in the film, and Joey Travolta and Jeff Lass served as songwriters. The film was narrated by Graham Nash. The film's production company was Normal Films. Joey Travolta first met Cross at a program Travolta led teaching the art of filmmaking to children with special needs. Travolta, an autism activist, helped educate Cross about filmmaking, and assisted him in getting his message out to a wider audience. Joey Travolta is a former special education teacher, and at the time of the film's production operated a children's film and acting workshop called Entertainment Experience. \\"So I mentored him with lights and the camera and editing. He did all the interviewing and research. I kind of worked one-on-one with him,\\" said Travolta of his work with Taylor Cross. Joey Travolta started the organization Actors for Autism, which assists those with the condition to create films. \\"I dedicated my life to this. I love working with kids and I love making films,\\" said Travolta to The Bakersfield Californian. Travolta commented on the impact of the film: \\"It was like a domino effect. And I found my calling.\\" After his experiences working on the film, Travolta began to teach film to autistic children at camps in California, Florida, and Michigan. Release The short film version was shown at a student film festival at Chaminade High School in West Hills, California in April 2004. Joey Travolta's daughter attended Chaminade High School, and he assisted in putting together the student film festival at the school. There was also a screening held in 2004 by the Ventura County Autism Society. The 10-minute film was shown at the Flutie Bowl in Boston, Massachusetts in December 2005. The feature-length version of the film was released on April 1, 2006. 2006 screenings included New York and Arkansas. The film was screened in October 2006 at the Hot Springs Documentary Film Festival. In April 2007, the Autism Society of Washington and the EWU and Washington State University Program for Communication Disorders sponsored a screening of the film at Eastern Washington University. Normal People Scare Me was featured as part of the Staten Island Film Festival in 2007. The 15th annual educational conference of the Developmental Disabilities Nurses Associations chose to feature a screening of the film at their 2007 meeting in New Mexico. Reception=Awards and recognition Taylor Cross received three prizes when his film was screened at the student film festival at Chaminade High School in April 2004. In November 2004, Cross was honored for his work on the film, at the gala benefit dinner for the Bubel-Aiken Foundation in Los Angeles, California. The Bubel-Aiken Foundation is a nonprofit organization that was founded in 2003 by the mother of an autistic son, Diane Bubel, and Clay Aiken, star of American Idol. Critical reception A review of the short film version in the Daily News of Los Angeles was positive, and Dennis McCarthy wrote: \\"You'll see some smiles and some tears. Some anger and a lot of frustration. You'll see the world of autism through the eyes of some beautiful kids living there.\\" Lenore Skenazy of New York Daily News wrote \\"It's an extremely moving film, mostly because it's impossible not to fall in love with the matter-of-fact kids on screen.\\" The Tri-Valley Herald referred to the documentary as a \\"highly acclaimed film\\". When Keri Bowers and Taylor Cross appeared on Sunday Today in April 2006, host Campbell Brown said to them: \\"We are so excited about this and really glad to have you on. We appreciate it.\\" See also *Autism Is a World *Autism Every Day *Autism: The Musical *The Transporters ReferencesExternal links *NormalFilms, official website of film * * Category:2006 films Category:English-language films Category:American films Category:2006 documentary films Category:American documentary films Category:Documentary films about autism Category:Films shot in Los Angeles ","title":"Normal People Scare Me"},{"id":"24614660","text":"Daniel Stenderup (born 31 May 1989 in Copenhagen) is a Danish footballer who plays for Hvidovre IF.

She remained in service, latterly as Catherine Carroll, at least into the 1960s. Construction and commercial service Fulton was built as a steel-hulled tug in 1909 by the Staten Island Shipbuilding Company at Port Richmond on Staten Island, New York as Yard Number 489. The tug had a length of , a beam of , a depth of and a draft of . She measured and and was powered by a compound steam engine of driving a single propeller. The tug was built for the Delaware, Lackawanna and Western Railroad Co. to tow barges carrying rail cars. She was registered at New York, with US Official Number 207060 and call-sign LBHQ. The vessel was named after Robert Fulton who was honored in New York City's Hudson‚ÄìFulton Celebration in 1909 on the centenary of his development of practical steamship technology. World War I service The U.S. Navy acquired her under charter on 30 April 1917 for service as a Section mine sweeper. After arming with a single 1-pounder gun, she was commissioned as USS Fulton (SP-247) on 22 September with two officers and sixteen men assigned to the Third Naval District. On 11 April 1918 her official name was reduced to SP-247. The Navy returned Fulton to her previous owner on 12 August 1919. Return to commercial service In 1919 Fulton resumed service with the Delaware, Lackawanna and Western Railroad. By 1958 she had been sold to Tug Fulton Corp., New York and renamed Catherine Carroll.

Riddell and Whight Memorial Hall (Kumamoto, Japan) Life=Early life and her determination Hannah Riddell was born in 1855 in Barnet, then a village to the North of London. Her father was a sergeant in the Army who was engaged in the training of the local militia. In 1877 the family moved to Mumbles in South Wales, and Hannah and her mother started a private school. The school was a success for some time but in 1889 it went into bankruptcy. Hannah's next job was as a superintendent for the YWCA in Liverpool. In 1890 she was selected by the Church Missionary Society (CMS) as a missionary to Japan. She arrived in Japan in 1891 and was transferred to Kumamoto, Ky≈´sh≈´. At Honmyoji, the most popular temple in Kumamoto, she witnessed leprosy patients begging for mercy and made up her mind to dedicate her life to their care. The Kaishun Hospital Hannah successfully approached influential people such as leaders of the CMS, university professors, industrialists and statesmen, and, later, the imperial family of Japan. She created a close circle of supporters such as Grace Nott, one of the five missionaries who had come to Japan with her, and Professors Honda and Kanazawa. Founding a hospital was an extremely difficult task, but Kaishun Hospital (known in English as the Kumamoto Hospital of the Resurrection of Hope) was opened on 12 November 1895. Negotiations with the CMS were laborious, but in 1900 Hannah won control of the hospital, simultaneously quitting the CMS. She devoted the rest of her life to fund- raising for the hospital. Professors Honda and Kanazawa helped with obtaining the land for it. The start of the Russo-Japanese War in 1904 brought a great financial crisis. English donors, fearing trouble because of the fleet of Russian warships approaching Japan, immediately stopped sending money to Japan. However, Marquis Okuma, who had donated many cherry and maple trees for the grounds of the hospital, joined with Viscount Shibusawa to invite many officials and prominent persons to the Bankers' Club in Tokyo to listen to Hannah Riddell's appeal. At the meeting Professor Kanazawa spoke for Riddell to the effect that Kaishun Hospital was a good hospital worth supporting, since Riddell was independent of the CMS. As a direct effect of the meeting Riddell's financial troubles ended. Japan's first leprosy prevention law was promulgated in 1907. In 1914 Riddell wrote in a long letter to Marquis Okuma: \\"I think the expenses of the government policy would not cost more than a single gunboat and the yearly expenses could well be met by a tax of about one sen (one hundredth of one yen) on every person in the land. The gain to Japan and to the humanity would be immeasurable.\\" Further work in Kusatsu, Okinawa and Kumamoto Hannah Riddell was interested in missionary work independent of the CMS. She sent missionaries to Kusatsu, a hot spring resort where lepers gathered. Later Mary Cornwall Legh, another English Anglican missionary, did substantial work there. She also sent Keisai Aoki, who was a patient and a Christian, to Okinawa, where, notwithstanding great difficulties, he succeeded in building a shelter, leading to the establishment of Okinawa Airakuen Leprosy Sanatorium. Although fundraising was delayed by the outbreak of the Great War in Europe, in 1924 a Japanese-style Anglican church was completed in the grounds of the Kaishun Hospital. Formally consecrated by Bishop of Kyushu, Arthur Lea on 24 June, the church was characterized by a long wheelchair ramp imported from England. In 1918 Riddell established the first scientific research laboratory in Japan for the study of leprosy. Ada Wright Ada Wright, Hannah Riddell's niece, came to Japan in 1896 and joined her in managing her work for lepers. After Riddell's death in 1923 Wright became the director of the Kaishun Hospital. In 1940, however, she was questioned by police over her possession of a short-wave radio and on 3 February 1941, the closure of the hospital was suddenly declared, and patients were transferred to the Kyushu Sanatorium (Kikuchi Keifuen). In April Ada Wright escaped to Australia. She came back to Japan in June 1948 and died in 1950. The ashes of both Hannah Riddell and Ada Wright were buried in the hospital grounds. Riddell's sex segregation policy of leprosy patients Leprosy is a chronic disease caused by mycobacterium leprae. An effective therapy was discovered in 1941 by Faget, after Riddell's death. Traditionally Japan and Japanese leprologists at that time adopted a segregation policy, but Riddell's thinking was unique. She firmly believed that the only way to stamp out leprosy in Japan was by segregation of the sexes, and she always insisted on it. She was against male and female patients even becoming friendly. Kensuke Mitsuda, a noted leprologist, commented that Riddell believed that what ended leprosy in England in the Middle Ages was the legal abolition of cohabitation of the sexes. The patients at the Kaishun Hospital accepted her segregation, but they could visit their families when indicated. Literary contribution Riddell, collaborating with Fanny B. Greene, M. F. Kirby and others, translated Iwaya's Fairy Tales of Old Japan (1903), the English version of 's Nihon mukashi banashi. Iwaya himself and other bibliographies credit Tsuda Ume[ko] as another collaborator., foreword: \\"Êó•Êú¨ÊòîÂô∫..„Çí..Êõ∏„ÅçÊîπ„ÇÅ„Åü„ÅÆ„ÅØÂçÅÂπ¥Ââç..‰ªä„Åù„ÅÆÂÖ®ÈõÜ„Åå„É™„ÉÉ„Éá„É´„ÄÅ„Ç∞„É™„Éº„É≥„ÄÅÊ¥•Áî∞„ÅÆË´∏‰ª§Â¨¢„ÅÆÊâã„Å´‰æù„Å¶Ëã±Êñá„Å´ÁøªË®≥„Åï„Çå..

It was to have featured the opening round of the 2009‚Äì10 A1 Grand Prix season, although A1 Grand Prix's involvement in the event was cancelled just five days prior to practice beginning. The event did feature the eleventh event of the 2009 V8 Supercar Championship Series, the 2009 V8 Supercar Challenge. The program was altered from two 200-kilometre races for the Australian touring car series to four 150-kilometre races. Mark Winterbottom won two of the four races over the weekend with Garth Tander winning the second race on Saturday and Craig Lowndes winning the first race on Sunday. Tander and Winterbottom won each of the two days on combined point score. Despite the extended V8 Supercar racing round and the last-minute inclusion of an \\"Australian Legends\\" parade featuring racing identities Dick Johnson, Kevin Bartlett, Jim Richards, Glenn Seton, Colin Bond and Bob Morris driving historic racing cars, valued in excess of $1 million each, the 2009 event failed to attract anywhere near the numbers of spectators of previous events and the A1GP no-show has resulted in two separate government inquiries into the event. Surfers Paradise residents' groups are also lobbying for the event to be scrapped or relocated to a purpose-built facility, yet to be built. The Queensland tax payers are investing close to A$12 million into the event annually. On 4 February 2010, the Queensland government announced that the SuperGP will be relaunched as the SuperCarnivale, an event developed and designed specifically for V8 Supercars. The announcement came after the release of two separate inquiries into the SuperGP event. Changes included shortening the event to three days instead of four and a shortening of the track. The fallout from the highly critical reports has resulted in the contract between the Queensland government and the event organisers ‚Äì The Gold Coast Motor Events Corporation (GCMEC) and the International Management Group (IMG) ‚Äì being canceled. The contract had another four years to run and was worth $11.8 million annually. The QLD government therefore had to pay out $2.5 million as a settlement fee upon termination. The result was that Nikon SuperGP General Manager Greg Hooton and Nikon SuperGP Event Manager David Bennett, as well the support staff at the GCMEC/IMG event offices, were sacked and the office closed down.

It has pale green, short-lived flowers with a cream-coloured or yellowish labellum and a more or less circular leaf which emerges at the base of the flowering stem after flowering.Lewis Roberts Description Nervilia concolor is a terrestrial, perennial, deciduous, sympodial herb which grows in colonies with only a few individuals producing flowers in any one year. Between two and six pale green flowers long and wide are borne on an erect flowering stem tall. The sepals are long and about wide and the petals are similar but slightly shorter. The labellum has three lobes and is cream-coloured or yellowish with hairy purple or green veins. The side lobes curl inwards and the middle lobe has wavy edges and three hairy ridges. The flowers only last up to four days, following which a single leaf develops, including on those plants that did not flower. The leaf is bright green, heart-shaped or kidney-shaped but appears almost circular, in diameter with wavy edges and prominent radiating veins. In Australia, flowering occurs between September and December after heavy rain but in areas north of the equator in April and May. Taxonomy and naming The tall shield orchid was first formally described in 1825 by Carl Ludwig Blume who gave it the name Cordyla concolor and published the description in Bijdragen tot de flora van Nederlandsch Indi√´. In 1825 Rudolf Schlechter changed the name to Nervilia concolor. The specific epithet (concolor) is a Latin word meaning \\"coloured uniformly\\". In Australia the species is known as Nervilia aragoana, first described in 1827 by Charles Gaudichaud-Beaupr√©. The species is known by a variety of vernacular names in Asia: *Malaysia: Daun sa- helai sa-tahun, daun satu tahun (Peninsular). *Thailand: Phaen din yen (Chiang Rai), waan phra chim (Bangkok). *Vietnam: Ch[aa]n tr[aa]u xanh, thanh thi[ee]n q[uf]y, Ian c[owf]. *Japan: Yaeyama-kuma-s√¥, aoi-bokuro Distribution and habitat Nervilia concolor occurs in Nepal, Bhutan, eastern India, Myanmar, Indochina, southern China, Taiwan, southern Japan, Thailand, the Malaysian region, the Pacific Islands, Queensland and the Northern Territory. It grows in forest, rainforest and monsoonal rainforest.
