Billed as a high-end graphics computer, the Power Macintosh 8500 was the first Macintosh to ship with a replaceable daughtercard. Though slower than the 132 MHz Power Macintosh 9500, the first-generation 8500 featured several audio and video (S-Video and composite video) in/out ports not found in the 9500. In fact, the 8500 incorporated near-broadcast quality (640√ó480) A/V input and output and was the first personal computer to do so, but no hard drive manufactured in 1997 could sustain the 18 MB/s data rate required to capture video at that resolution. Later, special \\"AV\\" hard drives were made available that could delay thermal recalibration until after a write operation had completed. With special care to minimize fragmentation, these drives were able to keep up with the 8500's video circuitry. The 8500 was introduced alongside the Power Macintosh 7200 and 7500 at the 1995 MacWorld Expo in Boston. Apple referred to these machines collectively as the \\"Power Surge\\" line, communicating that these machines offered a significant speed improvement over its predecessors. Infoworld Magazine's review of the 8500 showed a performance improvement in their \\"business applications suite\\" from 10 minutes with the 8100/100, to 7:37 for the 8500/120. They also noted that the 8500 run an average of 24 to 44 percent faster than a similarly-clocked Intel Pentium chip, with the performance nearly double on graphics and publishing tasks. The 8500's CPU was updated twice during its production run. It originally shipped with a 120 MHz PowerPC 604 CPU, later with the same chip running at 150 MHz, and finally with a PowerPC 604e running at 180 MHz.

The population was 14,324 at the 2010 census, and is the principal city of the Pottsville, PA Micropolitan Statistical Area. The city lies along the west bank of the Schuylkill River, south of Wilkes-Barre. It is located in Pennsylvania's Coal Region. History=Early settlement Charles II granted the land that eventually became Pottsville to William Penn. The grant comprised all lands west and south of the Delaware River and the Schuylkill; the site of Pottsville was originally in Chester County. When the legislative Council, on May 10, 1729, enacted the law erecting Lancaster County, which included all the lands of the Province lying westward of a straight line drawn northeasterly from the headwaters of Octoraro Creek (near the southern borders) marked with blazed trees, to the Schuylkill River, then this placed Pottsville in Lancaster County. By enactment of the same Council, approved on March 11, 1752, Berks County was erected; this placed Pottsville within the limits of that county. Pottsville's anthracite coal history began in 1790 when a coal seam was discovered by hunter Necho Allen. Legend has it that Allen fell asleep at the base of the Broad Mountain and woke to the sight of a large fire; his campfire had ignited an outcropping of coal. By 1795 an anthracite-fired finery forge was established on the Schuylkill River. 19th century View of Pottsville in 1854 In 1806 John Pott, the founder of Pottsville, purchased the forge. By an act of Assembly of the Commonwealth approved March 1, 1811, the County of Schuylkill was erected out of portions of Berks and Northampton; this placed the site of Pottsville in Schuylkill County. The town was formally laid out in 1816 by a local surveyor, Henry Donnell. Pottsville was established as a village in Norwegian Township in 1819 and incorporated as a borough on February 19, 1828. View of Pottsville, Pennsylvania by John Rowson Smith In 1829, D.G. Yuengling & Son established what is now the oldest operated family beer brewery in the United States. In 1851 Pottsville became the county seat, the original county seat being Orwigsburg.DC Henning, Esq., Early Annals of Pottsville, September 28, 1906. The Philadelphia and Reading Coal and Iron Company, which has its roots in the Philadelphia and Reading Railway Company, the remnants of which were acquired in the late 20th century by the Reading Anthracite Company, acquired extensive coal lands and would become one of the most notable of the coal companies operating in Pennsylvania until the demise of the anthracite industry after World War II. Because of its location along the Schuylkill River, Pottsville developed a small textile industry. Out of this industry grew the Phillips Van Heusen company which was founded in 1881. Moses Phillips and his wife Endel began sewing shirts by hand and selling them from pushcarts to the local coal miners. Van Heusen and other textile companies left the region starting in the late 1970s, mainly as a result of foreign competition. Another element of the textile industry was the Tilt Silk Mill on Twelfth Street, which produced silk from silk worms imported from China which fed on mulberry trees in the building's solarium. The silk business eventually was eclipsed by the development of nylon stockings. The building still stands and is presently the headquarters of a storage and vehicle rental business. 20th century During the Prohibition period in the United States, under the 18th Amendment, Yuengling all but stopped making beer and moved to production of \\"near beer\\". The three brews produced in this time were the Yuengling Special (the most popular brand), Yuengling Por-Tor (a version of their \\"celebrated Pottsville Porter\\"), and finally, the Yuengling Juvo, which was a cereal beverage. They were allowed a limited production of porter on the grounds that it had medicinal qualities. Then-owner Frank Yuengling also opened the Yuengling Dairy, which produced ice cream and other dairy products for the local area. These ventures helped to keep the company afloat during that period. When the 18th Amendment was repealed, Yuengling stopped production of \\"near beer\\" and resumed making alcoholic beverages. The brewery famously sent a truckload of its Winner Beer to the White House in 1933 as thanks to President Franklin D. Roosevelt for the repeal of Prohibition. Yuengling still continues its family-owned business today. It is the second largest American-owned brewery, after the Boston Beer Company, producer of Samuel Adams beer. The Yuengling Dairy was operated by a different branch of the family from the Brewery. Business declined and the dairy folded as of 1985. Attempted buyouts by large conglomerate breweries have all been unsuccessful. The Patterson Building served as the Pottsville Area High School from 1916 to 1933Pottsville High School Centennial: 1853‚Äì1953, page 8 Pottsville was chartered as a third-class city on March 22, 1911. Pottsville was host to a National Football League franchise from 1925 to 1928. The Pottsville Maroons played in Sportsman's Park (or Minersville Park) in nearby Minersville, now the site of King's Village shopping plaza. The Maroons posted some of the best records in the NFL during the 1925 and 1926 seasons. The Maroons had a claim to the 1925 NFL championship, but because of a controversial decision by NFL President Joe Carr, the title was instead awarded to the Chicago Cardinals. The Maroons suffered two more losing seasons before relocating to Boston and becoming the Boston Bulldogs. The Bulldogs folded in 1929. Until the middle of the 20th century, Pottsville was a popular destination for many traveling acts and vaudeville performers. The 1929 film Berth Marks stars the comedy legends Laurel and Hardy as they attempt to reach Pottsville by train for one of their booked performances. Pearl Bailey had once resided in Pottsville during the early part of her entertaining career. Soldiers in training at nearby Fort Indiantown Gap were prohibited from visiting Pottsville during most of World War II due to the large numbers of illicit venues and activities present during the time. 21st century The city completed in 2007 a streetscaping project on Centre Street. In June 2011, the City of Pottsville became the county's transportation hub for STS (Schuylkill Transportation System) bus service throughout the county with the $16.1 million Union Station Intermodal Transit Center at 300 South Centre Street.Pytak, Stephen J.

In 1841, the Philadelphia and Reading Railroad began and by 1845 was transporting nearly three times as much coal than the Schuylkill Canal. The Schuylkill Navigation Company decided to expand their canals to accommodate for larger boats, however in 1869 the canals were damaged due to flooding and began to decline. The Railroads became the number one transportation for coal and the canals eventually were filled by the Commonwealth of Pennsylvania by 1979.

It is distinct from Shenandoah Heights, which is part of West Mahanoy Township immediately to the north. History The area that became Shenandoah was first settled by a farmer named Peter Kehley in 1835 where he cleared a patch of land at the center of the valley and built a log cabin. Peter Kehley maintained his farm for about 20 years in total isolation. He sold his claim to the Philadelphia Land Company, which in anticipation of the opening of coal mines in the area, laid out the town in 1862. Six ton piece of coal at Girard Park. Booming growth occurred during the Civil War years caused by the development and opening of several anthracite coal mines. The area was incorporated as a borough in 1866 and was a famous hotbed of activity during the era of the Molly Maguires in the 1870s. After the original influx of English, Welsh, Irish, and German immigrants a large influx of people from central, eastern and southern European countries such as Poland, Lithuania, and Italy occurred in the decades before and after the turn of the 20th century. By 1920, the town had a population of nearly 30,000 residents. The community was hard hit by the decline of the anthracite coal industry after World War II and heavy emigration by coal miners occurred in order to find work elsewhere. 1889 Panoramic Map of Shenandoah, Pennsylvania In Schuylkill County Court, January 1902, those interested filed their petition for retail, wholesale, bottling or brewing licenses at the Office of the Clerk of the Court. Shenandoah was represented with bars and breweries. This coal town offered more bars per thousand people than any other location in the world. The Lehigh Valley Railroad Station served as the main passenger terminal in Shenandoah, but because of the coal industry, it was not the only railroad to service Shenandoah. The town was also served by the Pennsylvania Railroad and Reading Railroad, making Shenandoah the only borough in Pennsylvania to be served by three railroad companies. During the Great Coal Strike of 1902 the Pennsylvania National Guard was called into Shenandoah to keep the peace and curb rioting by angry miners. The strike would only be resolved after President Theodore Roosevelt intervened. Shenandoah, the rise and fall of the coal industry, and the dismantling of the Molly Maguires was one of the subjects examined by George Leighton in his 1939 book Five Cities: The Story of Their Youth and Old Age. Shenandoah Valley was featured in the documentary 2012 film \\"Shenandoah, Pennsylvania\\" exploring the hate crime murder of Luis Ramirez and the local police attempting to cover it up.  Origins of the name  The origin of the name Shenandoah is much debated. One theory holds that Shenandoah received its name from an Indian word meaning 'sprucy stream' or 'river flowing alongside high hills and mountains'. Another origin theory is that the town was named after the Shenandoah Valley in Virginia. The Virginia valley in turn took its name from an Iroquoian word meaning 'deer'.

Tamaqua (pronounced tuh-MAH-qwah) is a borough in eastern Schuylkill County, Pennsylvania, United States. The borough, located in Central Eastern Pennsylvania's Southern Coal Region, had a population of 7,107 as of the 2010 U.S. Census, a drop of less than 1% from 2000. In 2019, population of 6,691, Tamaqua is part of the Pottsville, PA Micropolitan Statistical Area. Tamaqua was taken from the territory of West Penn and Schuylkill Townships. Geography Tamaqua is located in a valley basin at (40.798600, ‚àí75.966498) situated within the Pennsylvania Southern Coal Region section of the Appalachian Mountains in the Schuylkill River drainage basin. Tamaqua's valley is just off the western end of the Pocono Mountains, just on the edge of the neighboring Lehigh watershed. Because of the dominant terrain the town is typical of medium towns in Ridge-and-valley Appalachians‚Äîlow lands and flats were historically given over to business, rail transport, and industries, with dwellings located upon the slopes above. According to the U.S. Census Bureau, the borough has a total area of , of which, of it is land and (1.31%) of it is water. Three streams pass through Tamaqua. The Little Schuylkill River, lesser known by its earlier name, the Tamaqua River, runs through the town from the north through the gap separating the folds of what would be an unbroken ridgeline but are now the separated ridges known as Sharp Mountain on the west and Nesquehoning Mountain. Panther Creek, flows southwest from Lansford, 5 miles away, and joins the Little Schuylkill in Tamaqua. The Wabash Creek joins the Little Schuylkill from the west. In the Tamaqua area, coal mining was a vital economic activity throughout the 20th century but with the diminished use of coal as a power plant fuel and the demise of steam powered traction, has since experienced a decline. The town also gained recognition as a railroad center. In addition, the 1885 Edison Electric Illuminating Co. of Tamaqua is said to have furnished the town with the nation's second incandescent municipal lighting system, a feat accomplished through the involvement of Thomas Edison. The nearest city to Tamaqua is Hazleton, just 12.5 miles north. Tamaqua is east of Pottsville, southwest of Jim Thorpe, approximately south of Scranton, approximately northwest of Philadelphia, and approximately southwest of New York City. Tamaqua's average elevation is above sea level. Elevations can reach up to above sea level. The borough has a warm-summer humid continental climate (Dfb) and the hardiness zone is 6a. Average monthly temperatures range from 26.0 ¬∞F in January to 71.0 ¬∞F in July. Railroads Until the late 1960s, Tamaqua was a hub of railroad activity, namely the Reading Company (RDG) and Lehigh & New England (LNE). A large rail yard existed in the southern part of town that actually extended through downtown; at one time eight tracks passed by the passenger station. An engine house, turntable, and car shop were located across the street from the passenger station in what is now the St. Luke's Medical Center parking lot. The collapse of the anthracite coal industry in the early 1960s, the Penn Central merger, and Hurricane Agnes all led to the railroad's demise. Today, all that remains is a single track line through town operated by the Reading and Northern Railroad. Transportation The main highway in the borough, Pennsylvania Route 309, connects Tamaqua with Allentown and Philadelphia, Pennsylvania in the south and Hazleton and Wilkes-Barre, Pennsylvania in the north, continuing past there as Route 29 to the New York State line. Route 309 serves as a truck bypass for Interstate 476, since many placarded trucks are not allowed in the Lehigh Tunnel, as well as a route of choice for access to the operating coal mines and industrial parks in the region. A second important highway in the borough is U.S. Route 209 that runs along the Panther Creek and intersects with PA-309 in the borough. Route 209 runs for approximately 212 miles from Millersburg, Pennsylvania in Dauphin County to the town of Ulster in Ulster County, New York. U.S. 209 also connects Tamaqua to many nearby municipalities, including the Schuylkill County seat at Pottsville in the west and both Jim Thorpe and Lehighton to the east. The town has a small rail yard, but its switching and geography makes it an important junction with tracks along both the Little Schuylkill River and others penetrating near the west-flowing Panther Creek and north into Hazleton. The town once hosted trackage of the Reading Railroad and the Lehigh and New England Railroad. Other highways near Tamaqua include Pennsylvania Route 54, Pennsylvania Route 443, Pennsylvania Route 895 and Pennsylvania Route 902, most of which connect the Tamaqua areas to the Poconos, the Lehigh Valley, and South Central Pennsylvania. In addition, Interstates 81, 80, 476, and 78 are not far from the town. Bus service is provided by Schuylkill Transportation System Route 45 (Pottsville-McAdoo) and Fullington Trailways (intercity). Carbon County Community Transit provides bus service to Tamaqua along Lynx 3, which runs between Hometown and Nesquehoning via Tamaqua, Coaldale, Lansford, and Summit Hill on Wednesdays.

Tamaqua was settled in 1799 when Burkhardt (alternatively Berkhard) Moser, accompanied by his son Jacob (born 1790) and by John Kershner, built shelters and a sawmill at the confluence of the Little Schuylkill River and Panther Creek, which is downtown Tamaqua today. According to property records, Moser had a partner named Houser, and together they owned 2,000 acres which Moser homesteaded. Moser built a log house at the base of Dutch Hill in 1801 for Mrs. Catherine Moser ‚Äî who as it happens was the first adult to die and receive burial there on February 15, 1822; followed later in April that year by John Kershner. Originally to be named Tuscarora, the name Tamaqua was chosen after it was realized that there already was a community named Tuscarora about four miles (6 km) to the west. The editor of The History of Schuylkill County wrote in 1881: That editor writes about the founding: Roughly half of Moser's original log cabin is still intact and visible behind a house on the north side of East Broad Street. The discovery of anthracite coal in the region in the early 19th century led to the town's rise as a coal- producing community. The town was incorporated as a borough in 1832. The first coal breaker, called \\"The Greenwood\\" was built as noted in the quotation, at the site of the first mine at the lower end of the Panther Creek Valley. Details about construction and development in Rahn Township, Pennsylvania and Coaldale on the county-line with sister-town Lansford from the same source history, illustrate it was definitely not the first breaker in the valley. LC&N; Co., with 10,000 acres in between Mauch Chunk and Tamaqua was known to have mine tailings accumulating in their lands within Coaldale.Macnamara (ed.), History of Schuylkill County as cited and linked, supported elsewhere in text. The Greenwood breaker in 1874, as noted in the above quote, was burned by the Molly Maguires in the labor troubles of that era. Irish, Welsh, and German immigrants came to the borough in the 1840s and 1850s, followed by a large influx of Italians, Lithuanians, Russians, Ukrainians, Slovaks, and Poles in the 1890s and early 20th century. During the 1860s and 1870s, Tamaqua was the geographic center hub for the Molly Maguires. One murder commonly attributed to the Mollies was that of town policeman Benjamin Yost, who was shot to death early one morning while extinguishing a gas lamp at the corner of West Broad and Lehigh Streets. The Tamaqua Railroad Station was constructed in 1874. Arguably Tamaqua's most famous landmark, it stood idle from the mid 1980s through the late 1990s after passenger railroad service to the town was discontinued. Initially planned to be demolished in the late 1980s, the non- profit group Save Our Station (S.O.S.) eventually managed to raise enough money to have it refurbished at a cost of $1.5 million. The station reopened in August 2004, now home to a full-service restaurant and gift shop. Rail excursions leave from there during the Tamaqua Historical Society's annual Heritage Festival on the second Sunday in October. 19th Century history Hotels = The first tavern in Tamaqua was kept in Berkhard Moser's house, by the widow of John Kershner and her son-in-law, Isaac Bennett. The date is uncertain, but it was opened about 1807. In 1827 the Little Schuylkill Company, thinking to draw the center of population to Dutch Hill, built the first stone building and hotel in Tamaqua. The house was converted into a dwelling thirty years afterward. In 1832 James Taggart, one of the pioneers in Panther Creek Valley, came to Tamaqua and opened a hotel; Michael Beard took possession in 1846. Between 1845 and 1847 the United States Hotel was built by the Little Schuylkill Company; it was first kept by Joseph Haughawout. In 1850 the Washington House, on Pine Street, was built, and the American and Mansion on Centre Street at a later period. = Literary societies and lyceums = In 1853 Tamaqua had a public library, and debating clubs discussed current events in the first town hall or schoolhouse as early as 1845. About 1856 the Tamaqua Lyceum was organized; it held weekly sessions in the south ward school building. To this lyceum Matthew Newkirk, of Philadelphia, made a gift of 1,500 books, which passed into the hands of the Perseverance Fire Company when the society disbanded. No records of the first organization remain. The principal citizens were members. On November 26, 1876, a group of men formed the Presbyterian Social and Literary Institute. = Cemeteries = The first graveyard was laid out in 1831 on Dutch Hill. The Catholic and Methodist burying grounds were laid out about 1837. The 30-acre Odd Fellows' cemetery is located at the western end of Broad Street. It is one of only two elaborate Victorian garden cemeteries in Schuylkill County. It is overseen by trustees appointed by Harmony Lodge of Odd Fellows, and it was first opened in 1865. Zion's cemetery was opened in 1876. 20th century history Tamaqua remained a thriving community throughout the heyday of coal production in the United States in the late 19th century and early 20th century. Certain sections of the borough, such as Dutch Hill and the South Ward, had a reputation for \\"toughness\\"; those sections were also densely populated by immigrants from southern and eastern Europe. However, in the 1950s as coal mines began tapering off, Tamaqua began declining, along with many other anthracite communities. Hurricane Diane caused tremendous damage to Tamaqua's railroad yards to the extent that they never fully recovered. In 1971 the borough annexed neighboring Rahn TownshipKuchta, David.The History of Coaldale, PA. and its Owl Creek section, home to the world's first fish hatchery. In 1945 John E. Morgan established a knitwear manufacturing industry in Hometown, 2 miles north of Tamaqua. The company, Morgan Knitting Mills, Inc, grew into one of the largest employers in the area, second only to the Atlas Powder Company. In the mid 1950s, Morgan, working from a design developed by his wife (Anna Hoban Morgan) patented the widely known Thermal Underwear product lines. Since Morgan's death in 2000, the Morgan Trust has donated money to various worthwhile causes in the Tamaqua area. The Morgan Trust also established the John & Dorothy Morgan Cancer Center at the Lehigh Valley Hospital. In the fiction of John O'Hara, a product of nearby Pottsville, Tamaqua appears as \\"Taqua.\\" Dial telephone service arrived in Tamaqua on August 6, 1961. The new exchange (668) still exists. Operators who worked the 12-position switchboard on the top floor of the Tamaqua National Bank at West Broad and Berwick Streets were transferred to Bell Telephone's Hazleton and Pottsville Toll Centers. The 55-block Tamaqua Historic District, Anthracite Bank Building, George Ormrod House, and Tamaqua Railroad Station are listed on the National Register of Historic Places. The borough of Tamaqua passed an unprecedented law giving ecosystems legal rights. The ordinance establishes that the municipal government or any Tamaqua resident can file a lawsuit on behalf of the local ecosystem. Other townships, such as Rush, followed suit and passed their own laws. Media Since June 14, 1965 Tamaqua has had an FM station, beginning as WSVB, later WZTA and WCRN, now WMGH Magic 105.5. The Bill Angst Little League Field in \\"Thomas Walsh Park\\" is adjacent to the original studios and transmitting tower in the Dutch Hill section of the borough. The studios are now with co-owned WLSH (AM 1410), 7 miles east of Tamaqua on Route 209 in Nesquehoning. The station's tower is in Tuscarora, 4.5 miles west of Tamaqua on Locust Mountain. Tamaqua is located in the Scranton DMA and receives television signals primarily from that area. Depending on cable providers, it is possible to receive signals from Philadelphia and New York City, as Tamaqua lies on the boundary line of the two markets. The main television stations broadcasting to Tamaqua are: *WNEP-TV, an ABC affiliate in Scranton, PA *WBRE-TV, an NBC affiliate in Wilkes-Barre, PA *WVIA-TV, a PBS member station in Scranton, PA *WLVT-TV, a PBS member station in Bethlehem, PA (licensed to Allentown) *WOLF-TV, a FOX affiliate in Plains, PA (licensed to Hazleton) *WFMZ-TV, an Independent station in Allentown, PA *WYOU-TV, a CBS affiliate in Wilkes-Barre, PA (licensed to Scranton) *WYLN-LP, an Independent station in Hazleton, PA Tamaqua receives broadcasts of the CW Network from New York City (WPIX-TV) and Wilkes-Barre (WSWB-TV).

The protagonist, Stevens, is a butler with a long record of service at Darlington Hall, a stately home near Oxford, England. In 1956, he takes a road trip to visit a former colleague, and reminisces about events at Darlington Hall in the 1920s and 1930s. The work received the Man Booker Prize for Fiction in 1989. A film adaptation of the novel, made in 1993 and starring Anthony Hopkins and Emma Thompson, was nominated for eight Academy Awards. Plot summary The novel tells, in first-person narration, the story of Stevens, an English butler who has dedicated his life to the loyal service of Lord Darlington (who is recently deceased, and whom Stevens describes in increasing detail in flashbacks). The novel begins in 1956, with Stevens receiving a letter from a former colleague, the housekeeper Miss Kenton, describing her married life, which Stevens believes hints at an unhappy marriage. Furthermore, Darlington Hall is short-staffed and could greatly use a skilled housekeeper like Miss Kenton. Stevens starts to consider paying Miss Kenton a visit. His new employer, a wealthy American named Mr. Farraday, encourages Stevens to borrow his car to take a well-earned vacation‚Äîa \\"motoring trip.\\" Stevens accepts, and sets out for Cornwall, where Miss Kenton (now Mrs. Benn) lives. During his journey, Stevens reflects on his unshakable loyalty to Lord Darlington, who had hosted lavish meetings between German sympathizers and English aristocrats in an effort to influence international affairs in the years leading up to World War II; on the meaning of the term \\"dignity\\" and what constitutes a great butler; and on his relationship with his late father, another \\"no-nonsense\\" man who dedicated his life to service. Ultimately, Stevens is forced to ponder Lord Darlington's character and reputation, as well as the true nature of his relationship with Miss Kenton. As the book progresses, evidence mounts of Miss Kenton's and Stevens' past mutual attraction and affection. While they worked together during the years leading up to the Second World War, Stevens and Miss Kenton failed to admit their true feelings toward one other. Their conversations as recollected by Stevens show a professional friendship which at times came close to blossoming into romance, but this was evidently a line that neither dared cross. Stevens in particular never yielded, even when Miss Kenton tried to draw closer to him. When they finally meet again, Mrs. Benn, having been married now for more than twenty years, admits to wondering if she made a mistake in marrying, but says she has come to love her husband and is looking forward to the birth of their first grandchild. Stevens later muses over lost opportunities, both with Miss Kenton and regarding his decades of selfless service to Lord Darlington, who may not have been worthy of his unquestioning fealty. At the end of the novel, Stevens instead focuses on the titular \\"remains of the day,\\" referring to his future service with Mr. Farraday and what is left of his own life. Characters *Mr. Stevens, the narrator, an English butler who serves at Darlington Hall; a devoted man with high standards who is particularly concerned with dignity (exemplified by the fact that the reader never learns his first name) *Miss Kenton, the housekeeper at Darlington Hall, later married as Mrs. Benn; an extremely capable and dignified servant who helps Mr. Stevens manage Darlington Hall. As time passes, she and Mr. Stevens develop a long-lasting bond *Lord Darlington, the owner of Darlington Hall; a conference he holds between high-ranking diplomats is ultimately a failed effort toward appeasement talks between English and German powers; this causes his political and social decline *William Stevens (Mr. Stevens senior), the 75-year-old father of Mr. Stevens, serving as under- butler; Stevens senior suffers a severe stroke during the conference at Darlington Hall; his son was divided between serving and helping him *Senator Lewis, an American senator who criticises Lord Darlington as being an \\"amateur\\" in politics *Young Mr. Cardinal, the son of one of Lord Darlington's closest friends and a journalist, he is killed in Belgium during the Second World War *M. Dupont, a high-ranking French politician who attends Lord Darlington's conference On his motoring trip, Stevens briefly comes into contact with several other characters. They are mirrors to Stevens and show the reader different facets of his character; they are also all kind and try to help him. Two in particular, Dr. Carlisle and Harry Smith, highlight themes in the book. Themes=Dignity The most important aspect of Stevens' life is his dignity as an English butler. To Stevens, what defines a \\"great butler\\" is a constant attitude of refined dignity, especially under stressful situations. As such, Stevens constantly maintains an inward and outward sense of dignity to preserve his identity, and dedicated himself wholly to the service of Lord Darlington. This philosophy of dignity, however, greatly affects Stevens' life‚Äîlargely with respect to social constraints, loyalty and politics, and love and relationships. In preserving his dignity at the expense of emotion, Stevens in a way loses his sense of humanity with respect to his personal self. Stevens' primary struggle within the novel is how his dignity relates to his own experiences, as well as the role his dignity plays in the past, present, and future.. Banter Banter is an underlying theme in the novel. In the prologue, Stevens notes that his new American employer, Mr. Farraday, takes a more casual attitude with his servants than Lord Darlington did, and seems to expect to banter with Stevens. Determined to please his employer, Stevens takes this new duty very seriously. He sets out to practice and study the art of banter, including listening to a radio programme called Twice a Week or More for its witticisms. He attempts to banter with people he meets during his vacation, but his remarks fall flat. He agonises over this, yet fails to realise that it is his delivery that is lacking. The true significance of banter becomes apparent at the end of the novel, when Stevens has met the retired butler who strikes up a conversation with him and tells him to enjoy his old age. Stevens then listens to the chatter of the people around him, in a positive frame of mind, and realises that banter is \\"the key to human warmth\\". Social constraints The novel does not present Stevens' situation as simply a personal one. It seems clear that Stevens' position as butler, and servant, has gradually made it impossible for him to live a fulfilling emotional life. When his father dies, Stevens is too occupied with worrying about whether his services are being carried out correctly to mourn (something that he later reflects on with great pride). Nor can Stevens bring himself to express feelings about personal matters, as to do so would compromise his dignity. Social rules at the time were a major constraint. As the book reveals, servants who wished to marry and have children would have immediately found themselves without a job, as married life is seen as incompatible with service, which requires total devotion. A truly \\"great butler\\" does not abandon his profession, and, as such, Stevens feels that such choices are foolish in regard to the life of a butler. Loyalty and politics Stevens is shown as totally loyal to Lord Darlington, whose friendly approach towards Germany results in close contacts with the Nazi Party and right-wing British extremist organisations, such as the Blackshirts of Sir Oswald Mosley. Due to this, Lord Darlington asks Stevens to fire two Jewish staff members, though Darlington later regrets this. Stevens is quite incapable of believing his master to be wrong in his political attitudes, as Lord Darlington's upbringing and heritage carry a certain type of dignity that is above and beyond Stevens' own. Love and relationships Stevens is arguably aware on some level of Miss Kenton's feelings for him, but he is unable to reciprocate. Miss Kenton's actions often leave Stevens bemused and puzzled, but his recollections of past interactions between the two reveal to the reader certain lost possibilities of their relationship. However, Stevens is never able to acknowledge the complex feelings he possesses for Miss Kenton, insisting only that they shared an \\"excellent professional relationship\\". It is not only the constraints of his social situation, but also his own stunted emotional life, that hold him back. During their time at Darlington Hall, Stevens chose to maintain a sense of distance born from his personal understanding of dignity, as opposed to searching and discovering the feelings that existed between himself and Miss Kenton. It is only within their final encounter that Stevens tragically becomes aware of his life's lost potential when thinking about Miss Kenton in a romantic light. Memory and perspective As with his other works, Ishiguro uses the structural devices of memory and perspective within this novel. Past events are presented from the viewpoint of the main protagonist, the ageing Stevens; elements of the past are presented as fragments, apparently subconsciously censored by Stevens to present (explicitly) a description of past occurrences as he would have the reader understand them and (implicitly) to relay the fact that the information supplied is subjective. Sometimes the narrator acknowledges the inaccuracy of his recollections and this raises the question of his reliability as a narrator. Allusions to real events The theme of the decline of the British aristocracy can be linked to the 1911 Parliament Act, which reduced their power, and to inheritance tax increases imposed after World War I, which forced the break-up of many estates that had been passed down for generations. The pro-German stance of Lord Darlington has parallels in the warm relations with Germany favoured by some British aristocrats in the early 1930s, such as Lord Londonderry and Oswald Mosley. Reception The Remains of the Day is one of the most highly regarded post-war British novels. In 1989, the novel won the Man Booker Prize, one of the most prestigious literary prizes in the English-speaking world. It ranks 146th in a composite list, compiled by Brian Kunde of Stanford University, of the best twentieth-century English-language fiction. In 2006, The Observer asked 150 literary writers and critics to vote for the best British, Irish or Commonwealth novel from 1980 to 2005; The Remains of the Day placed joint-eighth. In 2007, The Remains of the Day was included in a Guardian list of \\"Books you can't live without\\" and also in a 2009 \\"1000 novels everyone must read\\" list. The Economist has described the novel as Ishiguro's \\"most famous book\\". On 5 November 2019, the BBC News listed The Remains of the Day on its list of the 100 most influential novels. Adaptations *The novel was adapted into a film of the same name in 1993.

History=Founding Charlemagne Tower, founder of Tower CityTower City was founded by and named for Charlemagne Tower, a New York‚Äìborn lawyer who had come to Schuylkill County, Pennsylvania in 1846 to work with the legal issues regarding land claims to large coal and mineral deposits in that area. His first Pennsylvania practice was located in Orwigsburg, and then relocated to Pottsville in 1850 when it was made the Schyulkill County seat. Not long after Tower came to Pottsville, he began furiously purchasing and clearing liens to lands containing large anthracite deposits in and around Schuylkill County. This was part of an elaborate land grab scheme devised by Tower and his partner, Alfred Munson of Utica, NY. The plan called for Tower to use his legal acumen to clear all the liens and opposing claims to the Munson-Williams claim, and to all the land around it. In short, the partners hoped to create a single landed estate, which would have measured 65 miles by 4¬Ω miles (105 km by 7 km) at its widest point in southwest Schuylkill County. In return, Tower was to receive ownership and title to one half of all the land acquired once all the cost to Munson had been settled, or until Tower paid him half the value of the total land purchase.Sign constructed by the Rotary Club on Rt. 209 South outside Tower City. At the time, the Schuylkill Valley was a hotly contested property, with constant conflicts over titles and rights. Had any of their competitors became aware of what Tower and Munson were up to, they may well have bought up the land the pair were after, and charged exorbitant prices for it. Or worse, refuse to sell it at all. Thus, they chose to operate in secret. Tower would make the purchases, and convey the titles to legal dummies to hide the actual ownership of the land. By 1858 Tower and Munson were owners of eleven thousand acres (45 km2). By now, Munson and Tower's plan was well out of the bag, and anyone who had even a partial claim to any of the lands began to litigate. Only Tower's considerable skill as a lawyer kept the whole enterprise from falling apart. In 1867, Tower decided to start selling the lands, wanting to realize his interest in them. Unfortunately, he could not find a buyer at the time due to the title issues. Deciding instead to establish collieries on the land, in March 1868 he leased (6 km2) to two independent coal companies. It was a 15-year term, with a rental of $.30 for each ton of coal mined. The companies placed two collieries on the land, the Tower (Later known as East Brookside) and the Brookside. Near the collieries, Tower began to develop a small town, which was named Tower City when first surveyed. Tower laid out the town, and rented lots to settlers. The town was up and running by mid-1872, and immediately suffered a housing shortage. After these initial growing pains, the town grew steadily due to the collieries, and was officially incorporated on December 19, 1892 as a borough of Porter Township, Schuylkill County. The coal industry The Brookside was established in 1868, and administered by Williams, Jones, Savage, and W.B. Kaufman. This group held the colliery until 1872, and then sold it to Repplier & Company, which held it until 1873. During the early 1870s, Franklin Gowen, President of the Reading Railroad, had begun purchasing coal lands along the Railroad's right-of-way for the express purpose of building an anthracite coal monopoly. By 1875, Gowen had accumulated (283 km2), and Tower accepted his offer of purchase for his lands. Tower asked for and received $3 million from Gowen, for which Tower realized a profit of $1.5 million as per the original contract with the Munson family. (Alfred Munson died in May 1854.) Later that year, the Philadelphia & Reading Coal & Iron Company (a company set up by the Philadelphia & Reading Railroad to administer their anthracite properties) came into possession of the Brookside through its purchase of the Munson and Williams lands. When closed in 1938, the colliery had produced a total of 19,011,169 tons of coal over its lifetime. The original owners of the Tower colliery were E.D. and James Savage, Evans, and Althouse. They operated the colliery from 1868 to 1873, when it was purchased by Repplier, Gordon & Company. The colliery was in service until 1874, then abandoned. The total production of the Tower colliery to 1874 was 101,550 tons of coal. The Philadelphia & Reading Coal & Iron Company reopened the colliery in 1892 and renamed it the East Brookside. It was jointly operated with the Brookside, now known as the West Brookside. =Rail service= Tower City's emerging coal industry was initially serviced by the Good Spring Railroad, which built an extension from Donaldson to the Brookside in 1867. The Good Spring was initially controlled by the Reading Railroad, but transferred to the property of the Swatara Railroad in 1863. The Good Spring was then consolidated along with several other area railroads to form the Lebanon and Tremont Railroad in March 1871, and was reacquired by and merged into the Reading about a month later. In this new arrangement, the former Good Spring line was retitled as the Brookside Branch, and ran from the Brookside Colliery to Tremont, where it met the Lebanon and Tremont Branch. The Williams Valley Railroad began operations in 1892, which extended further from the Brookside branch into the Williams Valley west of Tower City. It came under Reading control itself within a few years.http://www.rrb.gov/blaw/bcd/bcd08-45.asp The Brookside branch was cut back to Keffer's Station in 1971, ending Tower City's connection with the then-Reading Company. =Notable mine disastersThe Brookside explosion The East Brookside Colliery, Tower City PAOn August 2, 1913, a double explosion occurred at the East Brookside Colliery, claiming the lives of eighteen men and seriously injuring two more. After the colliery had ceased production on Thursday night, Charles Portland, a contractor for the Reading, kept some of the men at work. The work force consisted of \\"Muckers\\", who are to clean out debris from blasting (work always done in the evening), a mucker boss, a blacksmith, and his assistant. The next day, Mine Boss John Farrell and Superintendent John Lorenz entered the mine to inspect some new work. At about noon, men on the surface reported a rumbling sound, which was followed by clouds of dust from the main entrance and fan- house. A rescue party of six men was mustered and lowered into the slope. The second explosion occurred shortly thereafter, roughly 20 minutes after the first. The work crew carried of dynamite into the mine the night before the explosion. It has been speculated that, during the course of work, one of the mucker's shovels may have struck the dynamite, detonating it. The second explosion is felt to have been caused by mine gases released by the first explosion.http://www3.gendisasters.com/pennsylvania/984/tower-city,-pa-east- brookside-colliery-mine-explosion,-aug-1913 The Porter Tunnel inundation On Tuesday, March 1, 1977, workers in the Porter Tunnel mine, while working in a new area, broke into a flooded area of the abandoned Bush Old Bootleg Slope Mine, causing the Porter Tunnel to flood. Nine miners were killed, three were injured, and one was trapped, but eventually rescued. Subsequent investigation determined that the map of the area used by management of the Porter Tunnel was inaccurate. It did not show the locations of all known bootleg mine works in the area, including most significantly, the Bush Old Bootleg. Management had suspected that the tunnel was nearby, and had instituted a program of drilling test holes in the work areas to probe for water. Workers had testified that this program was discontinued prior to the flood.

History Tuscarora derives its name from the movement of the Tuscarora people from their homelands in the Carolinas to New York during the aftermath of the Tuscarora War in the early 18th century. A part of the transitory Tuscarora settled at a point about 2 miles west of Tamaqua, Pennsylvania, where they planted apple trees and lived for a number of years.See Johnson, Elias, Legends, Traditions and Laws of the Iroquois, or Six Nations, and History of the Tuscarora Indians, (1881) It is probable that it was these Tuscarora who were later moved to Oquaga.Johnson, Legends 1881) Tuscarora lies within Schuylkill Township, which was one of the original townships of the county, organized in 1811.

Middleburg is a borough in Snyder County, located in Central Pennsylvania's Susquehanna River Valley. The population was 1,309 at the 2010 census. It is the county seat of Snyder County. Middleburg is part of the Selinsgrove, PA Micropolitan Statistical Area, and is also part of the larger Bloomsburg-Berwick-Sunbury, PA Combined Statistical Area. History Native Americans had lived in the region for centuries. White settlers are recorded living in the area in 1755. Middleburg was originally named Swinefordstown (Swinefordstettle in the Pennsylvania Dutch dialect) after John Albright Swineford who ran a tavern here in 1787. He was also the owner of land located on the north bank of the Middle Creek on which engineer Frederick Evans laid out the town in 1800.Local places renamed, The Writings of Agnes Selin Schoch, reprinted by Snyder County Times, February 23, 2008. This town became known as Middleburgh circa 1825, and was incorporated as a borough in 1864.Middleburg Bicentennial Committee: Middleburg, A Bicentennial Book, page 1. Country Print Shop, 1976. A portion of the site that Middleburg occupies was the location of the Stump's Run Massacre in January 1768. Stump's Run is located to the west of the Glendale Cemetery and is also near the Snyder County Historical Society. In this incident, two colonists named Frederick Stump and John Ironcutter were found to be responsible for the deaths of four Native American men, three Native American women, and three children over a two-day period. Four of the men and two of the women were killed at Stump's cabin, which was located at the mouth of the Middle Creek near Selinsgrove. After Stump and Ironcutter shoved the bodies through a hole in the ice, they traveled up the creek to Stump's Run to kill the remaining woman and the children. These bodies were thrown into the native cabins, and the cabins burned. Although the men claimed self-defense, it is suspected that this could have been provoked by a drunken brawl, or that the natives were killed by Stump in retaliation for the deaths of his wife and children at the hands of Native American raiders. The two men were arrested and taken to the Cumberland County jail at Carlisle for trial, but were freed at the hands of a sympathetic mob. The men were never recaptured.Dunkelberger, George F.: The Story of Snyder County, pps. 228-233. Gateway Press, Inc., 1997. The section of the borough located on the southern bank of the Middle Creek was developed in a manner entirely different from that of the settlement on the northern bank. This portion of the town began with a few pioneer homes and a grist mill; later a successor on this site would be known as the Franklin Roller Mills. When the Sunbury and Lewistown Railroad was constructed, more lots for homes were laid out, and the southern section of the town was first known as Franklin, and later, Swineford.Middleburg Bicentennial Committee: Middleburg, A Bicentennial Book, pps. 1 and 2. Country Print Shop, 1976. In January 1917, the property owners in Swineford petitioned the Middleburgh borough for annexation, and this wish was granted in February of the same year.Middleburg Bicentennial Committee: Middleburg, A Bicentennial Book, page 2. Country Print Shop, 1976. Despite the fact that the two towns were united under one government in 1917, two separate and distinct post offices operated in the borough until March 1955, when the Swineford post office was closed. The Swineford name is still used by the Swineford National Bank, which was founded in Swineford in 1903 and is listed as a part of the Fulton Financial Family in 2013.Middleburg Bicentennial Committee: Middleburg, A Bicentennial Book, page 5. Country Print Shop, 1976. A major employer in the town following the Second World War was the Middleburg Tannery. This facility was located in the Swineford section of Middleburg on the south bank of the Middle Creek. It employed nearly sixty men and women that tanned high grade sole leather. Most of the raw material used at the plant came from South America, and many of the finished products were used in the manufacture of Florsheim Shoes. The tannery complex was leveled by a devastating fire in June 1967 and it was never rebuilt.Middleburg Bicentennial Committee: Middleburg, A Bicentennial Book, page 24. Country Print Shop, 1976.

The population was 4,012 at the 2000 census. History The Bridge between Monroe and Penn Townships was added to the National Register of Historic Places in 1988. Geography Cliffs in Monroe Township According to the United States Census Bureau, the township has a total area of 15.8 square miles (40.8 km2), of which, 15.6 square miles (40.5 km2) of it is land and 0.1 square miles (0.3 km2) of it (0.76%) is water. Monroe Township is bordered by Union County to the north, the Susquehanna River, Shamokin Dam and Hummels Wharf to the east, Selinsgrove to the south, and Penn Township, Kratzerville and Jackson Township to the west. Hummels Wharf is a census-designated place within the township. Small creeks drain the township into the Susquehanna River. Flooding occurs in low-lying areas on an annual basis. A few areas have persistent standing water with most rains. Ground water is being monitored by the USGS. Ground-Water-Quality Data in Pennsylvania - A Compilation of Computerized Electronic Databases, 1979-2004 Economy The township (and inlaid Shamokin Dam) is home to most of Snyder County's commercial activity and serves as the location for nearly all of the county's national-chain retail outlets, hotels, and restaurants. The Susquehanna Valley Mall is in Monroe Township. The most recent addition is Monroe Marketplace, a collection of department stores and restaurants which was developed on farmland and the site of a former church camp along U.S. Routes 11 & 15\\\\. It was fully completed in 2009. Nearly every major \\"Big Box\\" retail format (e.g. home improvement, general merchandise, grocery, department store, and consumer electronics) has a presence in the township. U.S. Routes 11 & 15 combine at the township's north end and continue southward through the township in a combined fashion. The highway is a major travel artery through the region. Day time flow is constant (truck and vehicle) with very heavy loads and serious backups on Fridays and holiday weekends. A thruway project has been in the works to allow traffic to bypass the congested commercial area, with only a portion (that which bypasses Selinsgrove) having ever been completed. The remaining portion which would lie in Monroe Township exists only as a concept. Residents along the proposed route have expressed concerns about the negative impact on their quality of life that the thruway will mean. Others are concerned that the bypass will mean a loss of business that the traffic on highway brings to restaurants and hotels along the current route. The primary inhibition to construction is a lack of funding for the estimated $300 million project. The Penn Central Railroad passes through the township between Old Trail Road and the Susquehanna River, used for the delivery of coal to Sunbury Generation, a 420 MW coal-fired power plant in Shamokin Dam.

The village of Paxtonville lies on Middle Creek in Pennsylvania and is connected to Middleburg, Koonhunter and Beavertown by the Paxtonville Road. Before there was the road connecting the main street, Paxton Street, to Route 522, in use today, the main road ran along the north side of Middle Creek to Royer's Bridge. Settled in the late 18th century, it was first known as Kern's Mill and was renamed after Robert Paxton. Just after the Civil War an iron furnace was built there, but it fell into disuse after a relatively short period of time when richer ores were found in the Great Lakes region. In the early years of the 20th century, brick-making was a major industry; this ended in the summer of 1963 when fire destroyed the Paxton Brick Company. A water- powered sawmill and cider press were in operation about 1900. At various times businesses included a creamery, a restaurant, a cigar factory, a shirt factory, one or two general stores, a movie house, a barbershop, a grist mill and a gunsmith. As of December 2007, the town boasts a church and a feed mill, as well as a community center. The building housing the community center was previously a two-room school house in which instruction was provided for grades 1 through 8. Its last use for this purpose was in the Spring of 1955; after this time pupils were bussed to Middleburg. Around 1890 a school building stood on the north-east corner of Mill Street and the Paxtonville Road. The soil underlying the village is principally glacial till, but about 150 feet west and 50 feet south of the juncture of the Paxtonville Road and Paxton Street sedimentary rock lies just beneath the soil surface. Stone American Indian artifacts, chiefly arrow and spear points, are to be found at the north edge of town near the bank of Middle Creek. The completion of the Sunbury and Lewistown Railroad in the 1870s connected Paxtonville with these two cities, and for many years a number of daily passenger trains stopped at the Paxtonville station, which was located near the creek. Passenger service ended in the late 1920s although freight service to Paxtonville area continued into the 1960s. For a short period of time, toward the end of the 19th century, Paxtonville was shown on railroad maps as \\"Benfer.\\" A number of the oldest houses are log, but this construction is not evident because they have frame or shingle siding; they date from the early 19th century. there stands on the south side of Maple Avenue, about 100 feet west of the intersection with Paxton Street, a house of unusual construction. Built by Gabriel Gill about 1885, it lacks a frame, but the exterior walls serve this purpose, being constructed of three layers of one inch planks, with the middle layer running at a 90 degree angle to the other two which is one form of vertical plank wall construction. Over the years most residents have been of Pennsylvania-Dutch ancestry, as witnessed by family names such as Gill, Gift, Graybill, Hassinger, Kerstetter, Oldt, Olmstead/Umstead, Musser, Shaffer, Straub, Walter, and Wenrich. About 1900 the cemetery was moved from its position behind the church on the east edge of the village to its modern location on the south-west edge. Coffins and their contents were carried on horse-drawn wagons. Immediately after World War I donations from townspeople allowed the erection of the Memorial Hall on the west side of Paxton Street. It served a number of functions, including showing movies. During the era of silent films these were accompanied by the Paxtonville Orchestra.

Economics Efforts of local business leaders to promote development were rewarded in 2005, with a $2.4 million grant and low-interest loan package to develop Pawling Station Business Park. It is a site along Route 522 in Penn Township, that will feature three to lots with storm water drainage. An 18-member volunteer task force will oversee the construction of Pawling Park. The task force includes Pennsylvania Senator John Gordner and Rep Russ Fairchild, community leaders with a wide range of economic development experience and skills including an accountant, lawyer, land developer, engineer, surveyor, and two bankers ‚Äì along with chairmen of the Snyder County Board of Commissioners, Penn Township Board of Supervisors, and Township Municipal Authority.

History The community was founded in 1806 by Lt. Col. George Weirick (1773‚Äì1838), a veteran of the War of 1812, and son of Capt. Wilhelm Weirick (1731‚Äì1807), a veteran of the American Revolution, and grandson of German immigrant Johann Georg Weyrich (1702‚Äì1751). The village was originally called Weirickstown. Weirick served as county commissioner in 1824, justice of the peace in 1813, and as a member of the General Assembly of Pennsylvania (1832‚Äì1833). He is buried in the Salem Church Cemetery in Snyder County. The village name was later changed to Centreville, and then changed again due to a conflict with another village of the same name in Crawford County. The nearby creek's name was adopted sometime after 1842. The village was originally part of Northumberland County, then Union. On March 2, 1855, Penns Creek became part of Snyder County. Snyder County was named for Governor Simon Snyder of Selinsgrove. Buried in the old Sharon Lutheran Churchyard in Selinsgrove, Snyder was very popular and was the only governor of Pennsylvania to serve three terms. Environmental issues Ongoing pollution and soil erosion in the region continue to degrade the water quality and the environment locally as well as regionally. Farming, wastewater treatment facilities and industrial spills are cited as contributing factors to loss of water quality. It also contributes to the pollution of the Chesapeake Bay. Controlling the wastewater discharges alone is expected to cost local taxpayers billions of dollars.

Coal from the mines of the Zerbe Valley, near Trevorton was shipped to the town via the Trevorton and Susquehanna Railroad, which was completed in 1855, crossing the Susquehanna River on a long bridge from Herndon to Port Trevorton. A canal basin was built for coal loading from the railcars. However, a new route was built to the coal mines via Shamokin, and the bridge was removed in 1870.

The population was 5,654 at the 2010 census. Selinsgrove is geographically located in the middle of the Susquehanna River Valley in Central Pennsylvania, along U.S. Routes 11 and 15, north of Harrisburg and southwest of Sunbury. It is the home of Susquehanna University. History Selinsgrove was founded in 1787 by Captain Anthony Selin, who fought in the American Revolution. The Penns Creek Massacre on October 16, 1755 was the first of a series of deadly raids on Pennsylvania settlements by Native Americans allied with the French in the French and Indian War.Snyder County Post, 255 Years Ago This Week...The Penns Creek Massacre of 1755, 2010 A marker on the bank of Penns Creek north of Selinsgrove commemorates the massacre of 14 settlers and the capture of 11 more. In response to this and other Indian actions that day, Fort Augusta, Sunbury, Pennsylvania, the largest of Pennsylvania's frontier forts, was built in 1756 as a result of this conflict.Smith, Ivan., Seven Years War Timeline, Nova Scotia's Electric Scrapbook, 2013-12-11 Selinsgrove Hall and Seibert Hall at Susquehanna University and Gov.

Selinsgrove borders the Susquehanna River. The portion of the borough that is located between Penns Creek and the Susquehanna River is known locally as the \\"Isle of Que\\" (pronounced queue). Demographics Selinsgrove is the principal city in the Selinsgrove, PA Micropolitan Statistical Area, and is also part of the larger Bloomsburg-Berwick-Sunbury, PA Combined Statistical Area. As of the census of 2010, there were 5,654 people, 1,812 households, and 930 families residing in the borough. The population density was 2,976 people per square mile (1,149/km¬≤).

Hispanic or Latino of any race were 6.0% of the population. A majority of the Hispanic or Latino population was Puerto Rican. The presence of Susquehanna University strongly impacts the borough's demographics: 31.1% of the population lives in group quarters - largely dormitories - rather than in households. The student population is also visible in the disproportionate share of 18-24 year olds. Of the 1,812 households, 930 were families, 449 of which included related children under age 18. Among the families, 632 were husband-wife families, of which 231 had children at home. Only 92 households included 5 or more people.

Educational services and health care/social assistance combined are projected to be about 90.7% of all job growth by 2014 in the central region. Manufacturing of both non-durable and durable goods are expected to lose over 4,000 jobs (a change of about -9.1% in employment) in the same time period.

The population was 1,686 at the 2010 census. \\"Shamokin\\" , or \\"Shah√´mokink\\" in the Delaware language, and Schahamokink in another Algonquian language, means \\"place of eels.\\" The borough name is also derived from a dam that was built across the Susquehanna River in the 19th century. The dam supported steamboat ferries run by Ira T. Clement, which transported goods and people between Shamokin Dam and the city of Sunbury on the Northumberland County side of the river. These ferries operated from 1772 until the Bainbridge Street Bridge was built in 1907. The dam also provided water to the Susquehanna Division of the Pennsylvania Canal System which was constructed on the western bank of the river. The dam was destroyed by ice in March 1904. Shamokin Dam is distinct from the city of Shamokin, Pennsylvania, which is located to the east. Geography Railroads off E. 8th Ave in Shamokin Dam According to the United States Census Bureau, the borough has a total area of , of which is land and (2.66%) is water. Shamokin Dam sits on the western bank of the Susquehanna River just south of the confluence of the river's west and north branches. The borough is also bordered by the community of Hummels Wharf, Monroe Township, and U.S. Route 15. The Norfolk Southern Railway (formerly Conrail/Penn Central/Pennsylvania Railroad) passes through the borough between the Old Trail Road and the Susquehanna River. There are several small unnamed creeks that cross the borough eventually draining into the Susquehanna River. Seasonal flooding occurs in the lowlands between the rail line and the river where the canal once passed. Some areas of the borough lie in the 100 year flood plain. For many years addresses in Shamokin Dam were listed under the same ZIP code as Selinsgrove, which was 17870. This led to confusion by delivery companies, emergency services and visitors to the region. Additionally, tax funding that should have gone to Shamokin Dam was lost. The implementation of the GIS readdressing program required that several local communities rename streets so that there were no redundancies within the Selinsgrove ZIP code. This prompted Shamokin Dam officials to appeal to the United States Postal Service for a unique ZIP code. It was awarded. Shamokin Dam addresses became 17876.USPS, Post Office Changes, January 24, 2006 History Pennsylvania was, for centuries, the home of many Native American tribes. During the 17th century the region was dominated by the Haudenosaunee Iroquois Confederacy, which at that time included the Mohawks, the Onondagas, the Cayugas, the Senecas and the Oneidas. Under the Confederacy the area was hunting grounds for the Delaware, Shawnee, Conoy, Monsey, Mohican and Nanticoke peoples. Allummapeed was a Delaware chief who lived in Shamokin (now called Sunbury). A large population of Delaware Indians was forcibly resettled in the area in the early 18th century after they lost rights to their land in the Walking Purchase. Canasatego of the Six Nations, enforcing the Walking Purchase of behalf of George Thomas, Deputy Governor of Pennsylvania, ordered the Delaware Indians to go to two places on the Susquehanna River, one of which was an area that included both present-day Sunbury, Pennsylvania and Shamokin Dam.Weslager, C. A. (1972). The Delaware Indians: A History. Rutgers University Press: News Brunswick, p. 192. From 1727 to 1756, the village of Shamokin was one of the largest and most influential Indian settlements in Pennsylvania. In 1745, Presbyterian missionary David Brainerd described the city as being located on both the east and west sides of the river, and on an island, as well. Brainerd reported that the city housed 300 Indians, half of which were Delawares and the other Seneca and Tutelo.Rev. John Edwards, ed., Memoirs of the Rev. David Brainerd, New Haven, 1822, p. 233. In 1754, much of the land west of the Susquehanna was transferred from the Six Nations to Pennsylvania at the Albany Congress. However, Shamokin was not sold and was reserved by the Six Nations, \\"to settle such of our Nations as shall come to us from the Ohio or any others who shall deserve to be in our Alliance.\\"Weslager, C. A. (1972). The Delaware Indians: A History. Rutgers University Press: News Brunswick, p. 215. According to Weslager, \\"the Pennsylvania authorities had no opposition to the Six Nations reserving Wyoming and Shamokin from the sale, since friendly Delawares, including Teedyuskung (also known as Teedyuscung) and his people living in those settlements--and any other Indians who might be placed there--constituted a buffer against Connecticut.\\" The French and Indian War brought fighting to much of the region. The Delaware Indian residents of Shamokin remained neutral for much of the early part of the war, in part because a drought and unseasonable frost in Shamokin in 1755 left them without provisions.Weslager, C. A. (1972). The Delaware Indians: A History. Rutgers University Press: New Brunswick, p. 225-227. However, the Delaware Indians at Shamokin joined the war against Pennsylvania and the English after the Gnadenhutten massacre in 1755.Weslager, C. A. (1972). The Delaware Indians: A History. Rutgers University Press: News Brunswick, p. 229. Pennsylvania Fort Augusta was built in 1756 at Shamokin. Read more about early history of Shamokin in Shamokin (village). Shikellamy, of the Oneida people, came to the region. He negotiated with the white settlers on behalf of the native residents. In 1754, Chief Shikellamy negotiated with Conrad Weiser to set the Blue Mountains as the upper limit settlement in the native people's home lands. Weiser told the area's settlers they could not remain. The Six Nations Treaty of 1754 permitted settlements to move west of the Susquehanna River into lands that eventually became Snyder County. Many natives argued they had been cheated by the treaty. Conflicts between the settlers and the native peoples resulted in deaths on both sides. Eventually, the native peoples were pushed out by the white settlers after the French and Indian War. Germans were among the first European settlers in the region. Their influence continues today in the presence of the Amish and Mennonite sects. Shamokin Dam was founded by George Keen in 1745. At the time it was named Keensville. Most of the residents were canal workers, raftsmen, shad fishermen and eel fishermen. Restaurants and hotels provided support for the workers and travelers. A lock for the Pennsylvania Canal was located on the riverbank. Most of the local commerce revolved around transportation and supporting the canal.Bittinger, John W.; Calderwood, Virginia; Gill, Frank C.; Good, Sherman E.; Herrold, Dewey S.; et al. (1976). Snyder County Pennsylvania from Pioneer Days to the Present, pp. 3-31. Snyder County Communities National Bicenntenial, Inc.. In 1907 a toll bridge was completed that connected Shamokin Dam to Sunbury the county seat of Northumberland County. The cost for construction was $150,000. A full-time toll collector lived in the house that straddled the bridge. A gate closed the bridge at night. A bell was posted to summon the toll worker during the night. The bridge was used by pedestrians, buggies and motor cars. The toll was 3 cents for walkers, 4 cents for bicyclists, with 15 cents for horses, buggies and motor cars.Misur, Susan (2007) It used to cost to cross the river at Sunbury, Daily Item newspaper Flashback Feature April 9, 2007.

Economics The coal fired Sunbury power plant was commissioned by the Pennsylvania Power & Light company in 1949. It went into operation in 1953. The Sunbury Generation Station is located along the Susquehanna River in Shamokin Dam, Pennsylvania. The plant was purchased by WPS Power Development in November 1999 from PP&L; Resources. The plant is part of the Pennsylvania/New Jersey/Maryland (PJM) market area. Power from the plant is sold into Pennsylvania's deregulated electric market. In May 2005, the facility's emission allowances for both sulfur dioxide (SO2) and nitrogen oxides (NOX) were sold and a seasonal operation plan was announced. Then in July 2006 the plant was sold to Corona Power, LLC. The gross proceeds received by WPS for the 421.7 megawatt power plant were about $34.6 million, and were subject to certain working capital and other post-closing adjustments. In 2006, Corona Power, LLC sought and won a substantial reduction in the tax assessment of the property. The assessment was cut by more than two thirds. Additionally, there is a freeze on the assessment for several years regardless of improvements made on the property.Selinsgrove Area School Board Secretary, Selinsgrove Area School Board Meeting Minutes, August 6, 2007 While the future of the Sunbury Generation facility seemed to be in good hands with its purchase by Corona Power in 2006, in October 2007 Corona Power, LLC working with Merrill Lynch started the process of seeking buyers for the 400 megawatt Sunbury Generation facility. No longer in use, on October 25, 2019, the western half of the Sunbury Generating Station was demolished. Several other major local businesses including Kmart and Wal-Mart in Hummels Wharf and housing units in Selinsgrove borough have been successful in appealing their property tax assessments as well. There is also a new development called the Monroe Marketplace which contains businesses such as Target, Kohl's, and Giant, grocery store which are all located in Monroe Township, not the borough of Shamokin Dam. U.S. Routes 11 and 15 pass through the borough. The highway is a major travel artery through the region. Flow is constant (truck and vehicle) with very heavy loads and backups on Fridays (especially in the afternoon) and holiday weekends. There is a proposed major highway bypass project called the Central Susquehanna Valley Thruway. It is meeting with funding challenges that have delayed the project for decades. This thruway will cross Monroe Township just north of Shamokin Dam. Many residential properties are designated for eminent domain actions. Residents along the proposed route have expressed concerns about the negative impact on their quality of life that the thruway will mean. Pro development forces have been successful in overwhelming their objections. Others are concerned that, like the declining borough of Selinsgrove, the bypass will mean the loss of local revenue and jobs that the travelers on the highway bring to the many local restaurants and hotels located along the current Rte 11 & 15 highway. In June 2007 another two-year delay was announced by the Pennsylvania Department of Transportation. The primary hindrance is a lack of funding for the project's estimated cost of more than $300 million. The state's transportation has historically been grossly underfunded. This has resulted in hundreds of bridges and roads in need of repair. PennDOT report on Snyder County roads and bridges in need of repair. Environmental issues The public water supply is drawn from the Susquehanna River and treated at a modern facility located off Helen Street in the Borough. The Borough uses its own reservoir and an elevated water tower to supply the community. The Susquehanna River Heartland Coalition for Environmental Studies (SRHCES) is a nascent watershed organization whose geographic focus is the entire Susquehanna River West Branch watershed in Pennsylvania. The West Branch Susquehanna watershed drains an area of approximately . At present, SRHCES partners include representatives from six academic institutions (Bloomsburg University, Susquehanna University, Bucknell University, Lock Haven University, Kings College, and Lycoming College), the PA Department of Environmental Protection, the Northcentral Pennsylvania Conservancy, the Western Pennsylvania Conservancy, SEDA-COG, Forum-for-the-Future, and the Geisinger Health System.

History  Aerial view of Boswell and vicinity, May 12, 1939. Photograph was taken six weeks after the mine closed permanently. Note the coal tipple just outside the town, which was dismantled in 1940. Boswell was settled in 1901 and incorporated as a borough on February 22, 1904. The community's founder was Thomas Taylor Boswell, the first president and supervisor of the Merchants Coal Company. Mr. Boswell's company purchased of mineral rights under local farmland and laid out 1,600 lots for coal company houses to house the miners for its new deep coal mine just to the north. Merchants Coal, and the related Orenda Coal, were subsidiaries of Hillman Coal and Coke Company of Pittsburgh, the same firm that built the neighboring town of Jerome, Pennsylvania.Hillman Coal and Coke Company, Annual Report to Its Stockholders, 1921, p. 8. In Yale University Library. Houses and a church on Quemahoning Street Merchants Coal attempted to build Boswell to be a notch above surrounding coal company towns in that plans included a central business district, a high school, and homes constructed from brick, as opposed to the wood used elsewhere. This also helped to prevent the spread of fire, in the event that one would break out. Many of the original brick homes are still standing, with much of their original integrity. A branch of the Baltimore & Ohio railroad served Boswell and its coal mine. At its economic peak shortly after World War II, Boswell boasted two movie theatres, three department stores, a bank, several jewelry stores, a druggist, two funeral homes, three grocery stores, nearly a dozen restaurants and taverns, a lumber yard, and a weekly newspaper. Earlier, pre-Prohibition, Boswell also housed its own brewery. Boswell's streets generally run perpendicular to its avenues, in a grid. Many of the avenues in Boswell are named after coal company officials. For example: * Hower Avenue, after Charles E. Hower, a Surveyor from Johnstown. * Morris Avenue, after W.H. Morris, a known builder from Johnstown * Atkinson Way, after W.G. Atkinson, the Vice President of Merchants Coal Company. At the same time, the borough's street names can provide a geography lesson, following the flow of water from Boswell to the seas, with two exceptions made for streets in the central business district. Street names from north to south are: Quemahoning, Stonycreek, Center (in place of \\"Conemaugh\\" for the Conemaugh River), Main (in place of \\"Kiskiminetas\\" for the Kiskiminetas River), Allegheny, Ohio, Mississippi, Mexico (for the Gulf of Mexico), Atlantic and Pacific. The mine, Orenda Mine #1, extracted high quality, semi-bituminous coal. A steam engine hoisted the coal to the surface. The hoist pulled the coal cars up a coal tipple that was long, high, and wide. In 1920, this was the largest coal tipple in the world. At its prime, 900 men were employed and over 3,000 tons of coal were mined daily. The company was eventually renamed to the United Coal Company and in 1918 it became the Davis Coal Company. For most of its history, the mine at Boswell operated without union representation. An early attempt to unionize workers led to an armed riot on January 17, 1904. Seven were wounded and 20 arrested in the melee.Cassady, John. 1932. The Outline of Somerset County. Scottsdale, Pa.: Mennonite Publishing House. p. 49. A prolonged struggle for unionization, which began at Jerome and Windber in northern Somerset County in early April, 1922, extended to Boswell on April 17.\\"Boswell Miners Walk Out; Union Activity in Somerset Is Extending.\\" Johnstown Tribune. April 18, 1922, p.1. By April 24, 1922, miners at Acosta, Gray, Ralphton, Randolph and Jenners also joined the strike,Blankenhorn, Heber. 1924. The Strike for Union. New York: H.W. Wilson. pp. 17-28. which was to last sixteen months. (For a more detailed discussion of the strike, see the wiki for Jerome, Pennsylvania.) Mining disasters Aerial view of Boswell and vicinity, Sept. 12, 1967. Merchants Coal Company powerhouse at Boswell (1992 photo) There have been two noteworthy disasters at the Boswell mines. A methane gas explosion killed five miners in 1909 and another explosion in 1915 killed 22 miners.Brown, Scott C. Historic American Engineering Record. Town of Boswell. Boswell, Somerset County, Pa. HAER PA, 56-BOSW-3. Library of Congress. 1992. p. 4. Note that the Pennsylvania Department of Environmental Protection gives the dates as Jan. 25, 1909, 5 miners killed, and August 31, 1915, with 19 miners killed. Mining at Boswell was a problem-plagued effort, according to discussions with local residents from the era. While much archival research remains to be done corroborate these details, it seems apparent that Merchants Coal, and its parent which was eventually known as Hillman Coal & Coke, miscalculated in the siting of Boswell and its mine. Given the size of Merchant's capital outlay‚Äîincluding construction in Boswell of the world's largest tipple, a central business district and a high school‚Äîthe company planned big things for Boswell. The town of Jerome appears to have been built as a satellite town, soon to be linked with Boswell, both underground in coal production and on the surface in social and cultural life (the right-of-way for a street car line was acquired between Jerome and Boswell, for instance). However, local miners tell of the \\"Stone Wall,\\" an unexpected and virtually insurmountable underground geological fault hit midway between Jerome and Boswell that prevented the linking of the two mines at a reasonable cost. Evidence of this fault can be seen on the land surface near Route 601 about two miles (3 km) south of Jerome. (Indeed, when mechanized deep-mining resumed in this area for a time in the late 20th century, the entry shaft was sunk adjacent to this fault, presumably so access could be had to the entire field.) It can be speculated that Hillman had planned to use Boswell as its primary processing facility after the link-up, thus the huge tipple. Hillman also likely planned to make Boswell the center of operations and community life (of evidence, the high school). But the two mines never came together; in fact, Boswell's mine proved to be significantly less productive than Jerome's, as shown by documented production figures from 1927, for example. In that year, Boswell produced 204,592 tons of coal, while Jerome produced 816,568 tons, four times as much.Cassady, p. 48. The Boswell mine closed on March 29, 1939, due to the excessive cost of transporting coal to the surface (the Jerome mine worked until 1954). The Boswell tipple was dismantled in 1940, though some of the tipple's abutments still stand today. After the mine closed a slow economic decline set in. However, many businesses survived well into the 1960s and early 1970s. Railroad freight service to Boswell stopped in the early 1970s. Boswell today is primarily a bedroom community. In 1970, the high school was rechristened as North Star High School. It is the successor from the earlier Boswell, Jenner Boswell, Jenner-Boswell-Jennerstown, and Forbes High Schools. The high school is approaching its centenary and currently serves the two surrounding townships (Jenner and Quemahoning) and three boroughs (Jennerstown, Stoystown and Hooversville) in addition to Boswell residents. Orenda Park, a community forest and picnic area, has been established at the site of the former coal tipple. The park is maintained by the Boswell Area Historical Society. The Boswell Historic District was added to the National Register of Historic Places in 1994. Environmental impact of mining Drainage from the Boswell mine was a primary source of pollution into Quemahoning Creek, which flows just north of Boswell.SCRIP website. http://www.scrip.pa-conservation.org/stquepr.htm \\"The discharge, which is a large flow, [is] net alkaline, and high iron loading problem....\\" Quemahoning Creek is a tributary of the Stonycreek River. A remediation project was completed in 2005, spearheaded by SCRIP (Stonycreek-Conemaugh River Improvement Project), a non-governmental organization, in collaboration with OSM, the Pennsylvania Department of Environmental Protection, the Southern Alleghenies Conservancy, Somerset County Conservation District and Reliant Energy. In addition, the Jenner Rod & Gun Club, a local sportsmen's club, provided significant funds to purchase property for the remediation site. The discovery of the purple fringeless orchid, an endangered species, within the remediation site complicated the project. The plants were relocated successfully to unimpacted wetlands immediately adjacent to the remediation site in 2004.SCRIP website http://www.scrip.pa-conservation.org/stquepr.htm The most recent information showed the system is treating between 1,600 and 2,000 gallons of water per minute, removing approximately 80 tons of iron a day from the water.SCRIP website. http://www.scrip.pa- conservation.org/stquepr.htm About 3,000 trout were stocked successfully into a four-mile (6 km) section of the Creek downstream from Boswell in 2005, the first time the creek supported a fishery along this stretch in almost 100 years.

It was founded in 1894 by Anthony Wechtenhiser and received its name from its central location along the projected Midland Railroad. The objective was to build a railroad into the large coal field known to exist in this region. The projected railroad, under a preliminary survey made in 1894, would have extended the road southeast along Dark Shade Creek and Shingle Run valleys, across the mountain by way of Frazier's Gap, into Bedford County and eastward to the Atlantic seaboard. However, the project failed to develop. In 1913 an extension to the town was laid out by the Cook and Neasley Realty Company on lands then owned by John Wechtenhiser and Obadiah Lohr. The town was incorporated into the borough of Central City in 1918. Initially, there were big plans for the town of Central City. In 1921, Central City became a charter bank to the Federal Reserve Bank of Cleveland. It ceased printing currency in 1935. This bank, located on Main Street, printed over a half a million dollars worth of national currency during its existence. The inhabitants of Central City borough and the surrounding area are served by nine churches, sixteen stores, one hotel, five garages and service stations, three barber shops, a printing house, a photo studio, two funeral homes, a greenhouse, two veterans' organizations-American Legion and Veterans of Foreign Wars, and one financial institution‚ÄîCentral City Bank, a branch of AmeriServ Financial Bank of Johnstown. The Central City Volunteer Fire Company provides fire protection for both the borough and the surrounding area.

History Initial hunters and settlers in the territory that includes present-day Jenner Township were Mingo, also known as the Seneca, one of the Six Nations of the Iroquois.Cassady, John C. 1932. The Somerset County Outline. Scottdale, Pa.: Mennonite Publishing House. pp. 75‚Äì76. The land was ceded by the Iroquois Six Nations officially by the Treaty of Fort Stanwix of 1768 to Penn family as proprietors of Pennsylvania province.Cassady, pp. 80‚Äì81. Early European traders crossed Jenner Township as early as 1750, when Christopher Gist documented his brief time there in his travel diary.Cassady, p. 82 Gist is said to have named Quemahoning Creek, which drains much of Jenner Township. The Northern Trail, an established Indian trail, crossed the territory from east to west, intersecting Quemahoning Creek at Kickenapaulin's Town, a rather substantial Indian settlement, the site of which now lies under the waters of the Quemahoning Reservoir, just outside the township.Cassady, p. 113. In August 1758, the Northern Trail was improved, initially for the British military use, and renamed the Forbes Trail,Cassady, pp. 106‚Äì109 later known as the Pennsylvania Road, the Lincoln Highway, and now U.S. Route 30.Cassady, pp. 189‚Äì191. With the building of the Forbes Road to Fort Ligonier and, later, onward to Fort Pitt, present-day Pittsburgh, European settlement began in earnest. Jenner Township was formed out of the western part of Quemahoning Township in 1811.Cassady, p. 211 The township was named in honor of Dr. Edward Jenner, discoverer of the smallpox vaccine. Early Jenner Township settlers were primarily German and English speakers engaged in agriculture. Pennsylvania Dutch was still spoken in rural parts of the township until the 1960s. Some of the first settlers were Robert & Rhoda Smiley in the 1780s. Jenner Crossroads, the township's first substantial European settlement, grew near a grist mill and tavern stop established about 1800 along the Pennsylvania Road.Cassady, 1932. pp. 58, 213. Samuel Steel built a sawmill at Jenner Crossroads in 1817; John Shopwood opened a hotel in 1825, and Samuel Elder opened the first store in 1836.Cassady, pp. 50, 216. Other early industry in the township included a sawmill on Quemahoning Creek built about 1813 by Moses Fream and a small woolen mill, built in 1817 by William Dalley, enlarged by Owen and William Morgan later into a small settlement known as Morgantown.Cassady, pp. 50, 59. A Lutheran church was built in the township in 1814, a Methodist Episcopal church in 1827, a Reformed church in 1841, and a United Brethren church in 1849. Jenners, Ralphton, Acosta and Gray were each built shortly after 1900 as company towns by Consolidation Coal, a Rockefeller interest, for its newly opened deep coal mines. Immigrants from Poland, Italy, Russia, Ruthenia, Wales, and Ireland filled the coal towns. The Somerset Coal Strike of 1922‚Äì1923 centered in these towns, and nearby Boswell, Jerome and Windber. The strike, which ultimately failed in its goal to unionize miners, drew significant nationwide attention for the hardships suffered by local miners.For additional detail, see Blankenhorn, Heber. 1924. The Strike for Union: A Study of the Non-Union Question in Coal and the Problems of a Democratic Movement. New York: H.W. Wilson; Brophy, John. 1964. A Miner's Life. Madison: University of Wisconsin Press. Bussel, Robert. 1999. From Harvard to the Ranks of Labor: Powers Hapgood and the American Working Class. University Park: Pennsylvania State University Press. By the 1960s, the deep mines had closed. The town of Randolph was also a very small coal mining community in Jenner Township, any trace of which is now virtually gone, having been destroyed by highway construction in 1970. Surface mining and some deep mining of coal continues in the immediate area. Farming, timber harvest and tourism are also mainstays of the local economy. Jenner Township also serves as a bedroom community for the nearby Somerset and Johnstown areas.

The Jennerstown Speedway is visibly clearly at lower left. Jennerstown was first settled in the late 18th century as a stage coach stop on the Forbes Road, one of the first roads constructed by English-speaking settlers over the Allegheny Mountains. The town, originally named Laurel Hill, was later renamed Jennerville in honor of Dr. Edward Jenner, discoverer of the smallpox vaccine. Later, Jennerville became Jennerstown. The town and vicinity boast several buildings about 200 years old, which is not common in the surrounding area. Throughout its history, Jennerstown has served primarily as a wayside for travelers and as a farming community. Its post office was established in 1832, initially under the name of Laurel Hill. The village contained seven or eight houses, a store and a tavern at that time. Jennerstown incorporated as a borough in 1874. Jennerstown has never been a large town, and its current population represents a peak. Jennerstown is home to the Mountain Playhouse, one of the oldest venues for summer stock theatre in the United States. The Mountain Playhouse has maintained a full schedule of live theatre productions nightly from May through October each year for the last seventy-seven years.

To see a 1993 USGS aerial image of Jerome, click here Jerome was built in 1904 as a company town for what became the Hillman Coal & Coke Company of Pittsburgh,Hillman Coal and Coke, Annual Report, 1919. The town and mine were founded by United Coal Corporation. United Coal changed its name to Hillman Coal and Coke in May 1919, according to the company's Annual Report for that year, in Yale University Library. The 1919 Hillman Annual Report also indicated that the coal mine in the neighboring town of Boswell, operating under the subsidiary Merchants Coal, was also a Hillman concern, and named for Jerome Coulson, the son of a coal company official.Cassady, John C. 1932. The Somerset County Outline. Scottsdale, Pa.: Mennonite Publishing House. p. 213. However, note that, based on a town marker erected by the Pennsylvania Department of Transportation, the town was named for Jerome Hillman, scion of the Hillman family. This marker stood at the eastern approach to Jerome at Route 601 (Penn Avenue) for several decades in mid-20th century. The marker was removed by the State as part of road realignment and construction for US Route 219 in the late 1960s. The town filled mostly with immigrants from Croatia, Poland, Hungary, Russia and Italy‚Äîparticularly Italians from the Alpine province of Trentino and the town of San Lorenzo in Banale (part of the Dolomiti di Brenta area)‚Äîin addition to local Scots-Irish, Welsh and German stock. Jerome was the largest single coal mine in the Cambria-Somerset district.Blankenhorn, Heber. 1924.

These houses, especially in the period before 1970, typically were surrounded by large vegetable gardens, fruit trees and grape arbors. Homemade wine was a local specialty. At its economic peak, Jerome boasted a 300-seat movie theatre, a bank, a hotel, an auto dealership, several dry goods and grocery stores, several taverns, an electrical appliance store, a YMCA, and a bowling alley. A local tavern maintained a popular bocce court. The mine employed over 1000 men.Jerome: A Stroll in the Past. Commemorative book. Year 2000 Jerome Homecoming. p. 5. Residents from that period claim Jerome's population stood at about 3,000 at its peak, although this information is yet to be documented. However, Jerome's population certainly was sufficient to justify the capital investment to tie the town into the interurban transit system. Electric streetcar service from Jerome to the nearby city of Johnstown was proposed as early as 1908.Anon. Electric World. Jan. 2, 1909, p. 81. In 1921, the project was financed through a public bond offering, construction completed and service began.Hilton, George W., John Fitzgerald Due and John Due. 1960.

Jerome rapidly became a bedroom community. The town retained much of its close-knit ethnic character and its spirit well into the 1990s, however. As an example, the Jerome Volunteer Fire Department was founded in 1952 with Steve Gironda as its first president. The Volunteer Fire Department remains today as an anchor of community activity. In 1955, the Dorfman and Hoffman Company established a garment factory in the former Hillman company store building, bringing 200 needed jobs to Jerome. The factory continued operation until 1964.Jerome: A Stroll in the Past. Commemorative book. Year 2000 Jerome Homecoming. p. 16. A lumber mill operated out of former mining-operations buildings in the 1970s. A wind-whipped fire destroyed the lumber mill in 1975, and remaining mining buildings were demolished subsequently.

An important and the longest of these efforts was the strike that began on Good Friday morning, April 14, 1922, led by local miner George Gregory, with the assistance of outside union supporters.Blankenhorn 1924, p. 60. An earlier effort in 1906 failed here and elsewhere in Somerset County and no further organizing effort was directed at Somerset County until 1922, according to Beik,\\"The miners of Windber\\", which see below. Rumors of strikes at non-union mines, such as Jerome at that time, had been circulating for several weeks. Indeed, the General Policy Committee of the United Mine Workers Union issued a call on March 24 for the nation's 200,000 non-union miners to join a planned nationwide strike on April 1,\\"Calls on 200,000 Non-Union Miners To Join in Strike\\" The New York Times. March 25, 1922. Mines in northern Somerset County generally were non-union at this point, while most mines in Cambria County were organized. See Blankenhorn 1924, map inserts, for details. to coincide with the expiration of the current union contract.Beik, Mildred Allen. 1996. The miners of Windber: the struggles of new immigrants for unionization 1980s-1930s. University Park: Pennsylvania State University Press. pp. 268-272. Organizers slid past armed company police to circulate pamphlets and leaflets, as seen here and here, to encourage the miners' walk out.Blankenhorn 1924, pp. 15-17. Hillman Coal's viewpoint For its part, Hillman Coal and Coke believed it provided a willful benevolence within Jerome and Boswell, its two coal towns in Somerset County,For an excellent overview of corporate paternalism in western Pennsylvania company towns, see Metheny, Karen Bescherer. 2007. From the Miner's Doublehouse: Archeology and Landscape in a Pennsylvania Coal Company Town. Knoxville: University of Tennessee Press, pp.37-40. although miners under Hillman tutelage disagreed, as the strike would show. To be sure, Hillman ran these towns with an iron fist; simply to enter Jerome by car required inspection by a gauntlet of armed private police, for instance. But Hillman also built Boswell with a number of extra amenities, such as a high school, central business district, and brick construction for its patch housing. And in Jerome, the Company built a community center including a YMCA, pool hall, bowling alley, butchery, green grocer, theater, and post office, in addition to the Hillman Supply Company store. In October, 1921 Hillman established the First National Bank of JeromeHillman Coal and Coke Company 1921. Annual Report to Its Stockholders p.4 for its workers. It allowed for the construction of a streetcar line from Johnstown in 1921 (as noted above), which made travel easier and more frequent than could be provided by railroad. Hillman even engaged in a significant capital re- investment at Jerome, rebuilding a brick new community center after the initial structure was destroyed in a spectacular, wind-driven fire on April 2, 1922.‚ÄùJerome Is Swept by $100,000 Fire: Blaze Destroys Y.M.C.A., Hillman Company Store and Residence.‚Äù Johnstown Tribune. April 3, 1922, p. 18. However, demand for coal nationwide dropped precipitously and continually in the several years after World War I. In a response, Hillman closed its mines at Ella and Patterson, Allegheny County, and at Naomi, Fayette County,Hillman Coal and Coke Company 1921. Annual Report to Its Stockholders p. 3. but maintained production at Boswell and Jerome. By mid-1921, the Company told its shareholders in its Annual Report, ‚Äú‚Ä¶the demand [for coal] became so small and the competition from non-union fields so severe that it was evident that the non-union mines of your Company could not continue to operate unless wages were readjusted. As a result of this condition, wages were reduced‚Ä¶at your Jerome Mines on July 16, 1921.‚Äù Hillman continued that the reduction allowed the Jerome mine to operate ‚Äúon a competitive basis‚Äù and ‚Äúwith regularity,‚Äù with the result being that ‚Äúearnings of the men at your non-union mines for the year 1921 are far in excess of those received by men at union mines‚Ä¶.‚Äù, who, Hillman implied, suffered frequent short-term furloughs as the result of slack demand. Hillman told its shareholders that, prior to the pay cut, ‚Äúmen working by day were being paid $7.50 for eight hours work, and men working by the ton were able to earn $10.00 to $14.00 per day.‚Äù (Note that these wages reported by Hillman to its stockholders were flatly contradicted by other reportage, for instance, Blankenhorn maintained that union gross wages in 1922 more typically ranged from $14.60 to $17.50 per week, and after deductions for goods purchased through company stores, a typical miner's weekly net take-home pay often was less than $1.00.Blankenhorn 1924, p. 116) On all its coal operations, including Jerome and Boswell, Hillman Coal and Coke reported an operating profit of approximately $925,000, on revenues of $8.225 million in 1919,Hillman Coal and Coke Company 1919, Annual Report to Its Stockholders. p. 8 and an operating profit of approximately $336,000, on revenues of $4.475 million in 1921.Hillman Coal and Coke Company 1921. Annual Report to Its Stockholders. p. 7. But Jerome was seething. Hillman Coal & Coke cut miners' wages a second time during the deflation of 1921 and working conditions remained hard and strict, to miners' perception.Blankenhorn 1924, p. 50 Additionally, mine owners had recently ceased payment and expected miners to do for no pay \\"dead work\\", which was the removal of non-bituminous soils, slate and rubbish from the mines.\\"Worse Than Slaves Says Berwind Mine Committee's Report.\\" The New York Times. January 2, 1923. Gregory and local miners held several secret pre-strike rallies at the \\"Sokolniapolskawjerom\\", the Jerome Polish Falcons Hall,Blankenhorn, p. 89 although one wonders how secret they were, given over 600 men attended one meeting. Sensing trouble, Hillman suddenly increased its armed guard patrolling the town at the end of March, 1922.Blankenhorn, 1924, p. 60. Hillman police also were stopping all autos before entering Jerome.Blankenhorn, 1924, p. 17. Scattered walkouts began at smaller non-union mines‚Äîin St. Michael, Cambria County, a partial strike began April 1 and gained momentum through April 5, and at Mine 36, near Windber, Somerset County, a walk-out on April 6.Blackenhorn, 1924, pp. 18-20; Beik, p. 510. Powers Hapgood and his work On April 11, John Brophy, president of United Mine Workers Union District 2, asked Powers Hapgood, a 23-year-old Harvard graduate, who had given up his silver spoon to live and work as a miner, if he would volunteer to help organize Somerset County non- union mines.Brophy, John. 1964. A Miner's Life. Madison: University of Wisconsin Press, p. 184. Hapgood began at Jerome and Boswell.Bussel, Robert. 1999. From Harvard to the Ranks of Labor: Powers Hapgood and the American Working Class. University Park: Pennsylvania State University Press, p. 45. Hapgood went on to found the union local at Boswell and provide important support to miner Albert Armstrong at Gray and Acosta. See Bussel 1999, pp. 43-63, for full history of Powers Hapgood in Somerset County. The gentle- looking Hapgood, nephew of the U.S.‚Äôs ambassador to Denmark, at first evoked much derision among some Union officials, although apparently not among miners, with whom he worked shoulder-to-shoulder deep in the mines.Brophy, p. 184.Coleman, McAlister. 1943. Men and Coal. New York: Farrar & Rinehart. p. 111. Four decades later, Brophy wrote of Hapgood, \\"He was sincere, friendly, and courageous to the point of foolhardiness. By that I mean that he would sometimes drive ahead in a situation without considering sufficiently what he was up against. As a result, he got some pretty hard knocks at times.\\"Brophy, p. 185. In Jerome, Hapgood linked up with Gregory. While more acquainted with the rough-and-tumble than was Hapgood initially, Gregory himself‚Äîwho went by the nickname \\"Praying George,\\" because of his frequent and vocal prayers during workers' rallies‚Äîwas a strict teetotaler, who had been deputized by the local sheriff for a Prohibition squad.Blankenhorn, pp. 60-62 In idealism and social vision, Gregory and Hapgood were kindred spirits. The two became lifelong friends.Bussel, p.x In addition to direct work as a miner, Hapgood relied on three approaches to organize the Somerset coalfields ‚Äì civil disobedience, litigation and publicity. First, in pioneering methods evocative later of Mahatma Gandhi and Martin Luther King Jr., Hapgood depended heavily on peaceful, civil disobedience. Coal towns were the wholly owned, private property of corporations at the time, and so, in the eyes of these companies, simply walking the street uninvited was deemed to be trespassing. Hapgood in Somerset County was arrested more than a dozen times on the picket line and at the head of marches, as the strike unfolded.Bussel 1999, p. 46. (Hapgood, Gregory and other also took picketing directly to various corporate headquarters on Wall Street, where they did not invite arrest but achieve considerable positive publicity and access.) Hapgood‚Äôs arrests then gave him venue to the judicial system, where Hapgood insisted on his ‚Äì and the miners‚Äô ‚Äì procedural and Constitutional rights. Indeed, an important part of the Somerset County coal strike played out in the courtroom of Somerset County Judge John Berkey, where mine owners sometimes, but not always, prevailed under Judge Berkey‚Äôs often even-handed rulings.Bussel 1999, pp. 46-49. Hapgood, as the strike continued, then made sure that the plight of Somerset County miners remained front-page news across the United States. From the strike's beginning, Hapgood, Brophy, Gregory and other union leaders understood the powerful role public opinion could play;See for instance, \\"Mine Strike Develops Into Tug Of War for Support of the Public.\\" Johnstown Tribune, April 4, 1922, p.1 the men engaged in what, even by today‚Äôs best practices, would be seen as a sophisticated public relations program. In New York City, the program sparked sympathetic press coverage, generally effective public affairs, the intervention by the Mayor of New York on the miners' side, direct public appeals in the subways, and even the support of mine owners, such as John D. Rockefeller, Jr., whose family owned strike-bound Somerset County coal mines in Gray, Jenners, Acosta, Ralphton and Randolph. Gregory and other miners later traveled to Washington to meet with President Warren G. Harding.\\"Miners' Delegation Calls on President.\\" The Washington Post. November 21, 1922, p.2. The strike at Jerome begins On April 14, Jerome miners dressed for work and gathered at the shaft head, but refused to enter the mine. Blankenhorn, in his history of the strike, wrote, \\"The super began a conciliatory speech of promises of good treatment, 'What's the good of that? We've heard that bull for ten years,' cried Gregory.....'If you don't go to work, I'll shut down this mine till the grass grows over the drift mouth,' [the super responded]....A boy miner, DiGiancomo, shouted back, 'I'll eat that grass before I'll scab.\\"Blankenhorn 1924, pp. 60-61. Note that the Johnstown Tribune reported the strike began on Thursday, April 13. Further research will be required to clear contradiction. See \\"Somerset and Indiana County Miners Joining Union Men in Strike; Between 500 and 700 at Jerome Walked Out Yesterday Afternoon.\\" Johnstown Tribune. April 14, 1922, p. 1. And the strike was on. The men marched through Jerome, with an accordion player in the lead, to a mass-rally that was still going strong when union organizers arrived around noontime. The mine owners were thunderstruck; never before had they been hit by a successful universal rebellion against their rule.Brophy, pp. 185-186. The Jerome action lit the fuse; the strike spread to non-union mines in Hiyasota, Kelso, Boswell, Jenners, Listie, Acosta, Gray and elsewhere the next days; within one week a regional non-union coal work stoppage was in full force.Blankenhorn 1924, p. 62. Blankenhorn relates the story of one young anonymous miner from Acosta, Jenner Township, who could barely contain his excitement upon hearing of Jerome's strike. \\"The day I heard the Jerome boys was out I walked over there to be union. Thirteen miles over, thirteen back.\\" at p. 25. Blankenhorn gives these dates for strikes in other Somerset County towns: Boswell, April 17; Jenners and Acosta, April 24. See also \\"Boswell Miners Walk Out; Union Activity in Somerset Is Extending.\\" Johnstown Tribune. April 18, 1922, p.1. The Jerome strike was significant in that it was among the first and the largest non-union site in the region to join in the nationwide strike called by the United Mine Workers Union, thus provided tipping-point momentum for the strike, or as Blankenhorn expressed it in his book's table of contents, \\"Jerome's Explosion.\\" The 1922 strike became the largest action in United Mine Workers Union history; at its peak more than 500,000 union and non-union miners, in the bituminous and anthracite fields, had walked off their jobs.Bussel 1999, p. 45. Jerome was turned into an occupied camp by a strike that lasted sixteen months.Beik, Mildred A. 1989. \\"The miners of Windber: class, ethnicity and the labor movement in a Pennsylvania coal town, 1890s-1930s.\\" Ph.D. dissertation. Northern Illinois University, p. 557 By mid-May 1922, for instance, 29 Somerset County sheriff's deputies patrolled Jerome, alongside a much larger contingent of company police and a unit of the Pennsylvania State police. The State Militia arrived a few months later.Blankenhorn 1924, pp. 89-105. During this period, Hillman Coal systematically began to evict miner families from company-owned housing. According to Hillman records, quoted by Blankenhorn, 192 families in Jerome were set out into the street, about one-third of Hillman employment at the mine at the time.Blankenhorn 1924, p. 106 A 'tent city' was established for homeless strikers and their families on the nearby lands of sympathetic farmers.Jerome: A Stroll in the Past. Commemorative book. Year 2000 Jerome Homecoming. p. 10. These evictions here and elsewhere in Somerset County sparked an unusual swell of public sympathy. A commission appointed by the Mayor of New York City, which got its coal to run subways from various Somerset County coal mines, found \\"hundreds of strikers evicted and suffering from the cold\\", \\"saw in tents, hen-houses, stables and other improvised homes women and children whose feet were bare and bleeding\\" and declared that living and working conditions \\"were worse than the conditions of slaves prior to the Civil War.\\"\\"Worse Than Slaves, Says Berwind Mine Committee's Report.\\" The New York Times. January 2, 1923. John D. Rockefeller, Jr., whose family owned several Somerset County coal mines, but not Jerome's, wrote, \\"I believe that the underlying grievances of the miners in this district are well founded, and I have urged with all the sincerity and vigor at my command that the present labor policy of the operators, which seems to me to be both unwise and unjust, be radically altered.\\"\\"Rockefeller Sides With Coal Strikers.\\" The New York Times. October 26, 1922. The strike held together, despite its length and brutality; the Company said later that, of the approximately 750 miners on strike at its beginning, only about 100 broke ranks and returned to work early.Blankenhorn 1924 p. 99. In the last days of the strike in 1923, a number of buildings, railroad bridges and other property were destroyed by dynamite in acts of sabotage. A gunpowder or dynamite blast destroyed a shelter for homeless striking families.Blankenhorn 1924, p. xx.\\"Dwelling Dynamited, Several Hurt.\\" The Washington Post. June 4, 1923. p. 3. The building destroyed stood at the corner of Jerome Avenue and Keim Street. The Washington Post reported that the blast was heard miles away and caused over 500 broken windows in nearby homes. Dynamite destroyed a 200-foot steel railroad bridge spanning the Stonycreek River near Jerome on July 19, 1923.\\"Arrest 7 in Bridge Blast.\\" The New York Times. July 23, 1923. Somerset County Sheriff J.W.Griffith told writer Blankenhorn that both strikers and company employees held responsibility for explosions. \\"There are guards who want to keep their jobs going and strikers who have been making threats,\\" Sheriff Griffith said.Blankenhorn 1924, p. 212. Results of the strike at Jerome While the strike caused significant hardship, and even decayed into violence frequently from both sides, not all was grim. Blankenhorn, who was a writer for the magazine \\"The Nation\\", relayed the adventure of one young student and union organizer from Pittsburgh, named Viscosky, who convinced Hillman to hire him as a guard just prior to the strike. Blackenhorn wrote, Viscosky \\"used his very special opportunity to line them [the miners] up for a strike. The only man whom he reported to the company was one who refused to have anything to do with the 'union,' the company faithfully discharged that one.\\" Later, when Viscosky thought it prudent to disappear from Jerome before Hillman caught on, he convinced police officials to give him a free conduct pass through checkpoints, \\"so he could visit his sister in Jenners.\\"Blankenhorn 1924, p. 60. In August 1922, union miners agreed to a new contract that did not include non-union miners.Ricketts, Elizabeth Cocke. 1996. \\"Our battle for industrial freedom\\": radical politics in the coal field of central Pennsylvania, 1916-1920. Unpublished Ph.D. dissertation. Emory University. p. 465. The miners at Jerome and other Somerset County mines, left out of the contract, continued on for another twelve months, agreeing on August 14, 1923, to return to work finally having been exhausted by a process that, for them, produced little economic benefit immediately. At Jerome, Hillman Coal offered a general amnesty to most miners, if each returned to work as an individual and not as part of a union local. Nevertheless, the solid front displayed by Jerome miners laid the groundwork for the mine's eventual unionization in the 1930s. Further, as Hapgood, Blankenhorn, Beik and others point out, the miners themselves felt the 1922-23 strike to be a victory. Prior to the strike, miners felt atomized, helpless and hopeless; the coal towns of Somerset County were \\"visibly split\\" by ethnic divisions \\"admittedly...fostered by the coal companies\\" as a means of social control.Blankenhorn 1924, p.49. See also, Singer, Alan J. 1988. \\"Class-conscious coal miners: Nanty-Glo versus the open shop in the post World War I era.\\" Labor History. 29.1, at pp. 60-61, which describes, \\"a period of operator-operated Ku Klux Klan activity that attempted to drive a wedge between...Catholic and Protestant miners [in nearby Cambria County].\\" \\"[C]oal mining families....[lived] within a social, economic and political system of profound autocracy thinly veiled by shallow, pragmatic paternalism.\\"Ricketts 1996, p.132. After the strike, Jerome emerged with the beginnings of an increasingly strong, tolerant social fabric, which remained tight-knit for several generations and still provides important unifying elements today. Environmental impact of coal mining activities at Jerome The semi-bituminous coal bed at Jerome, part of the Upper Kittanning formation, was approximately six feet thick, capped by shale and limestone, with a smooth, hard sandstone floor. In 1911, the mine had a capacity of 1,700 tons a day, with an average daily output of 1,020 tons.United States. Bureau of Mines. 1914. Bulletin. Issues 83-85. U.S. Government Printing Office. pp. 307-308. The tipple had four loading tracks with a capacity of 80 cars. Within the tipple, coal was cleaned first by machine through shaker screens, then by hand, along a conveyor and at loading. Refuse coal and rock was dumped in a hillside to the south of the tipple. For the first 70-some years of its history, Jerome's landscape was dominated by this black, man-made mountain of coal mining wastes. The \\"bony pile,\\" as it was called, loomed from the hillside south of Penn Avenue and east of Cross and Fifth Avenues. Only a few plant species were hardy enough to survive the hot, dry, nutrient-deficient conditions on the pile.Bramble, W.C and R.H. Ashley. 1955. \\"Natural revegetation of spoil banks in central Pennsylvania.\\" Ecology 36, 417-423. Also see Baig, M.N. 1992. \\"Natural revegetation of coal mine spoils in the Rocky Mountains of Alberta and its significance for species selection in land restoration.\\" Mountain Research and Development. 12.3, 285-300. \\"Natural revegetation of coal spoils is sparse and patchy with low plant cover and this fact may be attributed to poor moisture and nutrient availability. Colonization by certain species is effective because of their low growth form, efficient vegetative reproduction mechanism, low nutrient requirements and/or N-fixing ability.\\" (at 285). Heavy metals, including arsenic and mercury, leached from the pile into the immediately adjacent area.Joensuu, O.I. 1971. \\"Fossil fuels as a source of mercury pollution.\\" Science 172, 1027-1028.

Boston: Kluwer. pp. 24-50. The pile was removed in the 1970s, when local electric generating stations found cost-effective ways to render additional coal out of the pile. A much smaller scar remains on the hillside. Most water runoff from the Jerome mine emptied into the South Fork of Bens Creek at Thomas Mills. Bens Creek used to be a robust trout habitat. Mine effluent contained high concentrations of iron, which rendered downstream sections of Bens Creek effectively sterile Mountain Laurel Chapter, Trout Unlimited \\"...the alkaline discharge causes...a red carpet of ferric hydroxide that smothers aquatic insect life...[and]...makes survival of fish in the affected area impossible because of lack of a food source.\\" from about 1900 to 1994. A remediation project (construction 1992-1994, re-engineered 2002) coordinated by the Stonycreek-Conemaugh River Improvement Project (SCRIP), a local non-governmental organization, restored Bens Creek by precipitating iron toxins from the effluent.Stonycreek-Conemaugh River Improvement Project Rock Hill Tunnel Project \\"...the alkaline nature of the discharge...simplified the treatment to a simple process of oxidation and settlement of iron oxide.\\" The Bens Creek project, also known as the Rock Tunnel Project is home to SCRIP's first mine drainage effort (see facts sheet on Bens Creek). SCRIP later restored other creeks and rivers in Somerset and Cambria Counties. Supplemental to the efforts of SCRIP, the Mountain Laurel Chapter of Trout Unlimited, a non-governmental organization, completed a substantial habitat improvement project aimed at increasing the number of fish that Bens Creek can hold.

Church of the Turnpike The stairs from the Pennsylvania Turnpike to St. John's Church in New Baltimore New Baltimore is perhaps best known for being home to the St. John the Baptist Church,St. John the Baptist Church and Retreat Center a Carmelite church located on the southern end of town. The church is unique in that it has two sets of steps along the Pennsylvania Turnpike at milepost 129, one set of each side of the highway. (The church itself is located on the eastbound side of the highway.) The steps dated from when the Turnpike first opened, as part of an informal, unwritten pact between the Pennsylvania Turnpike Commission (PTC) and the church after St. John's Church was separated from the rest of New Baltimore due to the Turnpike passing through.http://scottbeveridge.blogspot.com/2008/09/church-of-turnpike.html In addition, Carmelite priests were buried on the right-of-way of the Turnpike, and their graves had to be moved.http://tribune- democrat.com/local/x519138366/Turnpike-changes-bring-an-end-to-church- steps?keyword=secondarystory The steps have long been a novelty of the Turnpike and to curious travelers who have stopped along the Turnpike just to stop at the church. In 2007, the PTC announced that it would eventually remove the steps that lead to St. John's Church.https://www.usatoday.com/travel/news/2007-03-12-pa-turnpike- church_N.htm The steps are primarily being removed due to a widening project for the Turnpike. While a written pact has not been found by either the church or the PTC, even if a written pact were to be found, the Turnpike is forbidden by federal regulations to replace the steps in any case due to safety concerns. , the steps still remained.Google Street View: https://goo.gl/maps/sKvFy5n5cCB2 References Category:Boroughs in Somerset County, Pennsylvania Category:Populated places established in 1829 ","title":"New Baltimore, Pennsylvania"},{"id":"133806","text":"Loreto Convent in Omagh, County Tyrone, Northern Ireland, United Kingdom.

The population was 890 at the 2010 census. It is part of the Johnstown, Pennsylvania, Metropolitan Statistical Area, and located due north of Pennsylvania's highest peak, Mount Davis, which significantly constricts land travel routing south of the municipality. History Mineral Point, Somerset County, Pennsylvania, 1860 Construction of Casselman River Bridge, Rockwood, PA, circa 1914 Rockwood, Somerset County, Pennsylvania, 1915 Rockwood was initially known as Shaff's Bridge and then Mineral Point. Philip Wolfersberger built a house in what is now Rockwood in 1856, and he laid out the town in 1857 with Martin Meyers serving as the primary surveyor. John Poister built a hotel in 1860. 1868 saw the development of a post office, Henry Werner built a tannery in 1869, and a railroad depot was built in 1871. Philip Stauffer Wolfersberger, a son of the above Philip Wolfersberger, was a ticket agent of the Baltimore & Ohio Railroad (B&O;) and was instrumental in getting the current name of Rockwood to take hold. A view of Mineral Point / Rockwood appeared in a collection of photographs from along the B&O;'s lines that was published in book form in 1872 and digitized by the DeGolyer Library, Southern Methodist University. The Somerset & Mineral Point Railroad connected the town of Somerset with the Pittsburgh & Connellsville Railroad (owned by the B&O;) as it passed through Mineral Point / Rockwood. Both the Somerset & Mineral Point Railroad and the Pittsburgh & Connellsville Railroad were completed in 1871; the final section of the line between Pittsburgh & Cumberland was completed on the afternoon of April 10, 1871, with the final rail being laid near Forge Bridge, about 3 miles to the west of Mineral Point. There were eight stations located along the Somerset & Mineral Point line as it ran northeast along Coxes Creek: Mineral Point, Sames, Baker's, Milford, Mud Pike Crossing, Roberts, Cantner, and Somerset. Two individuals who were involved in the founding of Ursina, which had its own small branch railroad further south in Somerset County, were officers of the Somerset & Mineral Point Railroad in 1873: William J. Baer was President and H.L. Baer was Secretary. The B&O; bought the 10-mile Somerset & Mineral Point Railroad in 1879 for $60,000, knowing that an extension of the line to Johnstown, Pennsylvania, in Cambria County, was quite possible; this extension had already received legislative approval with session law no. 321 on Aug. 12, 1873. The Johnstown & Somerset Railroad followed the Stonycreek valley north-by-northeast from Somerset through Stoystown to Johnstown; it was built in 1881. The result was a rail line known as the Somerset & Cambria Branch Railroad stretching between the Pittsburgh & Connellsville Railroad at Rockwood and the Pennsylvania Railroad at Johnstown. The Somerset & Cambria Branch later became known as the S&C; Subdivision. In 1891 the Somerset Stone Company built a branch line from the Somerset & Cambria Branch Railroad's station at Milford east to its operation at Bare Rocks. A tragic accident along this company line on the evening of April 25, 1893, killed several people. A collision between two trains on the Pittsburgh & Connellsville Railroad, occurring about three miles east of Rockwood, claimed six lives in November 1894. The Wilson Creek Coal Company, in 1900, constructed a branch railroad off of the Somerset & Cambria Branch; this company line ran from about one mile north of Rockwood to its mining property about three miles to the east. The Baltimore & Ohio Railroad passes through Rockwood as it bends northerly in a long bow about the roots of Mount Davis, and it is now owned and operated by CSX, with daily Amtrak express trains between Pittsburgh and Cumberland, MD passing through the town and the nearby Cumberland Narrows. It is situated near and below the West slope-side summit-point of both the Nemacolin Trail and Braddock's Road, as well as the railway as each ascended past the crest up through the Cumberland Narrows pass from the forks of the Potomac at Harper's Ferry. The town was thus an important stop over point in the post-American Revolution westward migration into the Ohio Country and via the river boats built in Brownsville. The Penrose Wolf Building was added to the National Register of Historic Places in 2002. Rockwood is also home to Tanner Salyer Geography Rockwood is located at (39.916222, -79.155808). It is situated near and below the west-side crest of the Eastern Continental Divide separating the Potomac-Mississippi riverine systems along the north bank of the Casselman River--whose head waters are to the south in nearby Western Maryland--and just west of its confluence with Coxes Creek.

Schools  The borough of Rockwood is served by the Rockwood Area School District, which includes Rockwood Area Elementary School and Rockwood Area Junior/Senior High School. Both schools are located along the borough's boundary with Milford Township. A second elementary school within the district was the Kingwood Elementary School, which was not within the borough of Rockwood. Kingwood Elementary School is now closed, and the building was sold to the Kingwood Church of God. Typically, Rockwood Area High School graduates 65-80 students per year.Public Schools Report http://schools.publicschoolsreport.com/Pennsylvania/Rockwood/RockwoodAreaJshs.html  Transportation  Pennsylvania Route 653 runs through Rockwood. It comes southeast from New Centerville through part of Milford Township, entering Rockwood as Bridge Street. PA 653 then turns east onto Main Street, which it follows through the borough and out of town, entering Milford Township again briefly before crossing Coxes Creek and entering Black Township. The nearest limited-access highway is the Pennsylvania Turnpike at Somerset (Exit 110), to the north. Up until April 30, 1971, Rockwood was a stop on the Baltimore & Ohio's daily Washington--Akron passenger train. Since 1981 Amtrak's Capitol Limited (Chicago--Washington) has passed through Rockwood without stopping. Since 1990 local officials have lobbied for Rockwood to be added as a stop, and in October 2009 Amtrak released a feasibility study which placed the cost of a new station at $2.2 million. Proponents of the stop suggest that it might even benefit local resorts Seven Springs and Hidden Valley by increasing tourism business throughout the area.

On September 11, 2001, during the terrorist attacks on the United States, Shanksville received worldwide attention after United Airlines Flight 93 crashed into a field in Stonycreek Township, north of the town of Shanksville, killing all 40 civilians and four al-Qaeda hijackers on board. The hijackers had intended to fly the plane to Washington, D.C. and crash it into either the Capitol or the White House. However, after learning from family members via airphone of the earlier attacks on the World Trade Center and The Pentagon, the passengers on board revolted against the hijackers and fought for control of the plane, causing it to crash. It was the only one of the four aircraft hijacked that day that never reached its intended target. There are two memorials to the event. The original, temporary Flight 93 National Memorial to the passengers and crew of Flight 93 was located on a hill, about from the crash site. On July 8, 2010, a new temporary entrance and memorial were opened at an area called \\"the Western Overlook\\". It is where the FBI set up their command center and where family members first saw the aftermath of the crash, bringing their own memorials, and where visitors can leave them today. The initial phase of permanent construction of the Flight 93 National Memorial, including the visitor's center, was completed by the 10th anniversary in 2011. The memorial is built around the crash site, following the plane's flight path, and protecting the area of impact, known as the \\"Sacred Ground\\", which remains protected and accessible only to family members of the passengers and crew. Shanksville's volunteer firefighters, as well as emergency personnel from nearby towns of Central City, Somerset, and others, had rushed to the United Airlines Flight 93 crash scene to search for survivors.

September 11 attacks The crash site Stonycreek Township gained worldwide attention on September 11, 2001, when United Airlines Flight 93 crashed there. Flight 93 was one of four airliners hijacked that day as part of the al-Qaeda terrorist attack on the United States. It is widely held that the Flight 93 hijackers intended to use the craft to target the United States Capitol building or the White House in Washington, D.C. The crash here was a result of a struggle over control of the plane between hijackers and passengers, who learned of the plane's intended fate through cellphone calls to and from family members. All 44 people aboard the plane, including four hijackers, were killed. The community intends to preserve the Flight 93 crash site as a historical memorial.  Flight 93 memorials =Flight 93 National Memorial Photo of George W. Bush and Laura Bush visiting Stonycreek Township on September 11, 2002. The original temporary memorial to the passengers and crew of Flight 93 was located on a hill, about 500 yards from the crash site. On July 8, 2010, a new temporary entrance and memorial were opened at an area called \\"The Western Overlook\\". It is where the FBI set up their command center and where family members first saw the aftermath of the crash, bringing their own memorials, where visitors can leave them today. The initial phase of permanent construction of the Flight 93 National Memorial, including the visitor's center, was to be completed by the 10th anniversary in 2011. The first phase of the permanent memorial was completed, opened, and dedicated on September 10, 2011.

It is part of the Johnstown, Pennsylvania, Metropolitan Statistical Area. The population was 428 at the 2000 census. Stoystown is located SSE of Johnstown and northeast of Somerset. History Stoystown, Somerset County, Pennsylvania, 1860 The site of the Stony Creek Encampment is near the eastern end of Stoystown, slightly north of U.S. Route 30. This small supply depot was located along Forbes Road during the French & Indian War. Daniel Stoy was one of the first settlers west of the mountains. From the records of Harmon Husband, we find that Stoy lived along the Forbes Road about 1762 near the Casper Stotler place in Shade Township, that he made his living by hunting, and that he was driven from his cabin home several times by the Indians, taking refuge at Fort Bedford. The records of Husband state that on one occasion Stoy shot an Indian intruder from his cabin door. With the construction of the Pennsylvania Road, Stoy decided to move to a place about ten miles farther west along the road where he received a warrant for more than three hundred acres of land. Here on this tract of land along the Pennsylvania Road, he founded the town of Stoystown in 1774. Stoy served as a volunteer in the Revolutionary War with the rank of corporal. It is thought that he also served in the French and Indian War, although the records are rather vague. Henry was born in 1747. Married Sally Stoy, daughter of Daniel M. Stoy, who sold lots and laid out the town of Stoystown about 1800, one of the oldest towns in Somerset Co., PA... Daniel M. Stoy served as captain in Gen. George Washington's army for 12 months. He was discharged at Long Island, NY., July 1778. Later he moved to what is now Somerset Co., PA. He was a Justice of the Peace. He served in the General Assembly in 1809-10 and 13. He died 1834. D.A.R. marker on grave. Daniel Stoy, born in England, May 3, 1738, died Jan 11, 1835, in Stoystown, Somerset Co., PA. He was married about 1759 to Sarah Higgins of Scotland, born April 4, 1737 died Oct 31, 1818. Soon after their marriage they came to America and located at Conchohockin, PA., where their six children were born, viz., (1) Sarah (Sally), the oldest daughter, married Henry Beaver; (2)Daniel married a Miss Shedrick; (3)Ned never married; (4) John married Elizabeth Pisel; (5) William; (6) Margaret, the youngest child, born at Conchohockin, Oct 15, 1780, died Dec. 6, 1868. She was 7 years old when her parents moved to what was then Bedford Co., now Somerset Co., PA. She married Abraham Spangler and they had 14 children. Henry Beaver moved his family from Stoystown, PA to Greensburg, Westmoreland Co., PA. They had one son that we know of, John F. Beaver, who read law at Greensburg, PA.

In some species, the valves are highly calcified, and many are somewhat irregular in shape. Many, but not all oysters are in the superfamily Ostreoidea. Some types of oysters are commonly consumed cooked or raw, and in some locales are regarded as a delicacy. Some types of pearl oysters are harvested for the pearl produced within the mantle. Windowpane oysters are harvested for their translucent shells, which are used to make various kinds of decorative objects. Etymology The word \\"oyster\\" comes from Old French oistre, and first appeared in English during the 14th century.Oysters in Cynee, Recipe for Oysters in Bread Sauce (Oysters in Cynee) from the 1390 English text, The Forme of Cury, from Celtnet Recipes The French derived from the Latin ostrea, the feminine form of ostreum,ostrea, ostreum, Charlton T. Lewis, Charles Short, A Latin Dictionary, on Perseus which is the latinisation of the Greek ·ΩÑœÉœÑœÅŒµŒøŒΩ (ostreon), \\"oyster\\".·ΩÑœÉœÑœÅŒµŒøŒΩ, Henry George Liddell, Robert Scott, A Greek-English Lexicon, on Perseus Compare ·ΩÄœÉœÑŒ≠ŒøŒΩ (osteon), \\"bone\\".·ΩÄœÉœÑŒ≠ŒøŒΩ, Henry George Liddell, Robert Scott, A Greek-English Lexicon, on Perseus Types=True oysters True oysters are members of the family Ostreidae. This family includes the edible oysters, which mainly belong to the genera Ostrea, Crassostrea, Ostreola, Magallana, and Saccostrea. Examples include the European flat oyster, eastern oyster, Olympia oyster, Pacific oyster, and the Sydney rock oyster. Ostreidae evolved in the Early Triassic epoch: The genus Liostrea grew on the shells of living ammonoids.Hautmann et al. (2017): Geologically oldest oysters were epizoans on Early Triassic ammonoids. Journal of Molluscan Studies 83:253-260 https://doi.org/10.1093/mollus/eyx018 Pearl oysters alt=Photo of opened oyster in bowl with person using a knife to remove the pearl Almost all shell- bearing mollusks can secrete pearls, yet most are not very valuable. Pearls can form in both saltwater and freshwater environments. Pearl oysters are not closely related to true oysters, being members of a distinct family, the feathered oysters (Pteriidae). Both cultured pearls and natural pearls can be extracted from pearl oysters, though other molluscs, such as the freshwater mussels, also yield pearls of commercial value. The largest pearl-bearing oyster is the marine Pinctada maxima, which is roughly the size of a dinner plate. Not all individual oysters produce pearls naturally. In nature, pearl oysters produce pearls by covering a minute invasive object with nacre. Over the years, the irritating object is covered with enough layers of nacre to become a pearl. The many different types, colours and shapes of pearls depend on the natural pigment of the nacre, and the shape of the original irritant. Pearl farmers can culture a pearl by placing a nucleus, usually a piece of polished mussel shell, inside the oyster. In three to seven years, the oyster can produce a perfect pearl. These pearls are not as valuable as natural pearls, but look exactly the same. Since the beginning of the 20th century, when several researchers discovered how to produce artificial pearls, the cultured pearl market has far outgrown the natural pearl market. Other types A number of bivalve molluscs (other than true oysters and pearl oysters) also have common names that include the word \\"oyster\\", usually because they either taste like or look somewhat like true oysters, or because they yield noticeable pearls. Examples include: *Thorny oysters in the genus Spondylus *Pilgrim oyster, another term for a scallop, in reference to the scallop shell of St. James *Saddle oysters, members of the Anomiidae family also known as jingle shells *Dimydarian oysters, members of the family Dimyidae *Windowpane oysters File:Crassostrea_gigas_p1040847.jpgPacific oyster File:Ostrea edulis Marennes p1050142.jpgPacific oyster, opened In the Philippines, a local thorny oyster species known as Tikod amo is a favorite seafood source in the southern part of the country. Because of its good flavor, it commands high prices. Anatomy Oysters are filter feeders, drawing water in over their gills through the beating of cilia. Suspended plankton and particles are trapped in the mucus of a gill, and from there are transported to the mouth, where they are eaten, digested, and expelled as feces or pseudofeces. Oysters feed most actively at temperatures above . An oyster can filter up to of water per hour. Chesapeake Bay's once-flourishing oyster population historically filtered excess nutrients from the estuary's entire water volume every three to four days. Today, it would take nearly a year. Excess sediment, nutrients, and algae can result in the eutrophication of a body of water. Oyster filtration can mitigate these pollutants. In addition to their gills, oysters can also exchange gases across their mantles, which are lined with many small, thin-walled blood vessels. A small, three- chambered heart, lying under the adductor muscle, pumps colorless blood to all parts of the body. At the same time, two kidneys, located on the underside of the muscle, remove waste products from the blood. Their nervous system includes two pairs of nerve cords and three pairs of ganglia. While some oysters have two sexes (European oyster and Olympia oyster), their reproductive organs contain both eggs and sperm. Because of this, it is technically possible for an oyster to fertilize its own eggs. The gonads surround the digestive organs, and are made up of sex cells, branching tubules, and connective tissue. Once the female is fertilized, she discharges millions of eggs into the water. The larvae develop in about six hours and exist suspended in the water column as veliger larvae for two to three weeks before settling on a bed and maturing to sexual adulthood within a year. Habitat and behaviour Oyster reef at about mid-tide off fishing pier at Hunting Island State Park, South Carolina A group of oysters is commonly called a bed or oyster reef. Rocks in intertidal zone covered by oysters, at Bangchuidao Scenic Area, Dalian, Liaoning Province, China As a keystone species, oysters provide habitat for many marine species. Crassostrea and Saccostrea live mainly in the intertidal zone, while Ostrea is subtidal. The hard surfaces of oyster shells and the nooks between the shells provide places where a host of small animals can live. Hundreds of animals, such as sea anemones, barnacles, and hooked mussels, inhabit oyster reefs. Many of these animals are prey to larger animals, including fish, such as striped bass, black drum and croakers. An oyster reef can increase the surface area of a flat bottom 50-fold. An oyster's mature shape often depends on the type of bottom to which it is originally attached, but it always orients itself with its outer, flared shell tilted upward. One valve is cupped and the other is flat. Oysters usually reach maturity in one year. They are protandric; during their first year, they spawn as males by releasing sperm into the water. As they grow over the next two or three years and develop greater energy reserves, they spawn as females by releasing eggs. Bay oysters usually spawn from the end of June until mid-August. An increase in water temperature prompts a few oysters to spawn. This triggers spawning in the rest, clouding the water with millions of eggs and sperm. A single female oyster can produce up to 100 million eggs annually. The eggs become fertilized in the water and develop into larvae, which eventually find suitable sites, such as another oyster's shell, on which to settle. Attached oyster larvae are called spat. Spat are oysters less than long. Many species of bivalves, oysters included, seem to be stimulated to settle near adult conspecifics. Pacific oyster Crassostrea gigas equipped with activity electrodes to follow their daily behaviour Oysters are considered to filter large amounts of water to feed and breathe (exchange O2 and CO2 with water) but they are not permanently open. They regularly shut their valves to enter a resting state, even when they are permanently submersed. Their behaviour follows very strict circatidal and circadian rhythms according to the relative moon and sun positions. During neap tides, they exhibit much longer closing periods than during the spring tide.Tran, D., Nadau, A., Durrieu, G., Ciret, P., Parisot, JP., Massabuau, JC. 2011. Field chronobiology of a Molluscan bivalve: how the moon and sun cycles interact to drive oyster activity rhythms. Chronobiology International, Vol. 28, Num. 4: 307-317. Some tropical oysters, such as the mangrove oyster in the family Ostreidae, grow best on mangrove roots. Low tide can expose them, making them easy to collect. The largest oyster-producing body of water in the United States is Chesapeake Bay, although these beds have decreased in number due to overfishing and pollution. Willapa Bay in Washington produces more oysters than any other estuary in the US.Ruesink Lab ‚Äì About the Bay Other large oyster farming areas in the US include the bays and estuaries along the coast of the Gulf of Mexico from Apalachicola, Florida in the east to Galveston, Texas in the west. Large beds of edible oysters are also found in Japan and Australia. In 2005, China accounted for 80% of the global oyster harvest. Within Europe, France remained the industry leader. Common oyster predators include crabs, seabirds, starfish, and humans. Some oysters contain crabs, known as oyster crabs. Nutrient cycling Bivalves, including oysters, are effective filter feeders and can have large effects on the water columns in which they occur.Padilla, D.K. 2010.

What is not used for animal growth is then expelled as solid waste pellets, which eventually decompose into the atmosphere as nitrogen. In Maryland, the Chesapeake Bay Program had implemented a plan to use oysters to reduce the amount of nitrogen compounds entering the Chesapeake Bay by per year by 2010. Several studies have shown that oysters and mussels have the capacity to dramatically alter nitrogen levels in estuaries. In the U.S., Delaware is the only East Coast state without aquaculture, but making aquaculture a state- controlled industry of leasing water by the acre for commercial harvesting of shellfish is being considered. Supporters of Delaware's legislation to allow oyster aquaculture cite revenue, job creation, and nutrient cycling benefits. It is estimated that one acre can produce nearly 750,000 oysters, which could filter between of water daily. Also see nutrient pollution for an extended explanation of nutrient remediation. Ecosystem services As an ecosystem engineer oysters provide \\"supporting\\" ecosystem services, along with \\"provisioning\\", \\"regulating\\" and \\"cultural\\" services.

They have been cultivated in Japan from at least 2000 BC. In the United Kingdom, the town of Whitstable is noted for oyster farming from beds on the Kentish Flats that have been used since Roman times. The borough of Colchester holds an annual Oyster Feast each October, at which \\"Colchester Natives\\" (the native oyster, Ostrea edulis) are consumed. The United Kingdom hosts several other annual oyster festivals; for example, Woburn Oyster Festival is held in September. Many breweries produce oyster stout, a beer intended to be drunk with oysters that sometimes includes oysters in the brewing process. The French seaside resort of Cancale in Brittany is noted for its oysters, which also date from Roman times. Sergius Orata of the Roman Republic is considered the first major merchant and cultivator of oysters. Using his considerable knowledge of hydraulics, he built a sophisticated cultivation system, including channels and locks, to control the tides. He was so famous for this, the Romans used to say he could breed oysters on the roof of his house. Still- Life with Oysters by Alexander Adriaenssen In the early 19th century, oysters were cheap and mainly eaten by the working class. Throughout the 19th century, oyster beds in New York Harbor became the largest source of oysters worldwide. On any day in the late 19th century, six million oysters could be found on barges tied up along the city's waterfront. They were naturally quite popular in New York City, and helped initiate the city's restaurant trade. New York's oystermen became skilled cultivators of their beds, which provided employment for hundreds of workers and nutritious food for thousands. Eventually, rising demand exhausted many of the beds. To increase production, they introduced foreign species, which brought disease; effluent and increasing sedimentation from erosion destroyed most of the beds by the early 20th century. Oysters' popularity has put ever-increasing demands on wild oyster stocks. This scarcity increased prices, converting them from their original role as working-class food to their current status as an expensive delicacy. In the United Kingdom, the native variety (Ostrea edulis) requires five years to mature and is protected by an Act of Parliament during the May-to-August spawning season. The current market is dominated by the larger Pacific oyster and rock oyster varieties which are farmed year-round. Fishing from the wild The alt=Photo of woodland stream with oyster shells covering the streambed Oysters are harvested by simply gathering them from their beds. In very shallow waters, they can be gathered by hand or with small rakes. In somewhat deeper water, long-handled rakes or oyster tongs are used to reach the beds. Patent tongs can be lowered on a line to reach beds that are too deep to reach directly. In all cases, the task is the same: the oysterman scrapes oysters into a pile, and then scoops them up with the rake or tongs. In some areas, a scallop dredge is used. This is a toothed bar attached to a chain bag. The dredge is towed through an oyster bed by a boat, picking up the oysters in its path. While dredges collect oysters more quickly, they heavily damage the beds, and their use is highly restricted. Until 1965, Maryland limited dredging to sailboats, and even since then motor boats can be used only on certain days of the week. These regulations prompted the development of specialized sailboats (the bugeye and later the skipjack) for dredging. Similar laws were enacted in Connecticut before World War I and lasted until 1969. The laws restricted the harvesting of oysters in state-owned beds to vessels under sail. These laws prompted the construction of the oyster sloop- style vessel to last well into the 20th century. Hope is believed to be the last-built Connecticut oyster sloop, completed in 1948. Oysters can also be collected by divers. In any case, when the oysters are collected, they are sorted to eliminate dead animals, bycatch (unwanted catch), and debris. Then they are taken to market, where they are either canned or sold live. Cultivation Oyster culture in alt=Oysterman standing in shallow water examining row of oyster cages that stand two feet above the water Oysters have been cultured since at least the days of the Roman Empire. The Pacific oyster (Magallana gigas) is presently the most widely grown bivalve around the world.FAO Fisheries & Aquaculture ‚Äì Aquatic species Two methods are commonly used, release and bagging. In both cases, oysters are cultivated onshore to the size of spat, when they can attach themselves to a substrate. They may be allowed to mature further to form \\"seed oysters\\". In either case, they are then placed in the water to mature. The release technique involves distributing the spat throughout existing oyster beds, allowing them to mature naturally to be collected like wild oysters. Bagging has the cultivator putting spat in racks or bags and keeping them above the bottom. Harvesting involves simply lifting the bags or rack to the surface and removing the mature oysters. The latter method prevents losses to some predators, but is more expensive. The Pacific oyster has been grown in the outflow of mariculture ponds. When fish or prawns are grown in ponds, it takes typically of feed to produce of product (dry-dry basis). The other goes into the pond and after mineralization, provides food for phytoplankton, which in turn feeds the oyster. To prevent spawning, sterile oysters are now cultured by crossbreeding tetraploid and diploid oysters. The resulting triploid oyster cannot propagate, which prevents introduced oysters from spreading into unwanted habitats. Restoration and recovery In many areas, non-native oysters have been introduced in attempts to prop up failing harvests of native varieties. For example, the eastern oyster (Crassostrea virginica) was introduced to California waters in 1875, while the Pacific oyster was introduced there in 1929. Proposals for further such introductions remain controversial. The Pacific oyster prospered in Pendrell Sound, where the surface water is typically warm enough for spawning in the summer. Over the following years, spat spread out sporadically and populated adjacent areas. Eventually, possibly following adaptation to the local conditions, the Pacific oyster spread up and down the coast and now is the basis of the North American west coast oyster industry. Pendrell Sound is now a reserve that supplies spat for cultivation. Near the mouth of the Great Wicomico River in the Chesapeake Bay, five-year-old artificial reefs now harbor more than 180 million native Crassostrea virginica. That is far lower than in the late 1880s, when the bay's population was in the billions, and watermen harvested about annually. The 2009 harvest was less than . Researchers claim the keys to the project were: * using waste oyster shells to elevate the reef floor to keep the spat free of bottom sediments * building larger reefs, ranging up to in size * disease-resistant broodstock The \\"oyster-tecture\\" movement promotes the use of oyster reefs for water purification and wave attenuation. An oyster-tecture project has been implemented at Withers Estuary, Withers Swash, South Carolina, by Neil Chambers-led volunteers, at a site where pollution was affecting beach tourism. Currently, for the installation cost of $3000, roughly 4.8 million liters of water are being filtered daily. In New Jersey, however, the Department of Environmental Protection refused to allow oysters as a filtering system in Sandy Hook Bay and the Raritan Bay, citing worries that commercial shellfish growers would be at risk and that members of the public might disregard warnings and consume tainted oysters. New Jersey Baykeepers responded by changing their strategy for utilizing oysters to clean up the waterway, by collaborating with Naval Weapons Station Earle. The Navy station is under 24/7 security and therefore eliminates any poaching and associated human health risk. Oyster-tecture projects have been proposed to protect coastal cities, such as New York, from the threat of rising sea levels due to climate change. Human impact The accidental or intentional introduction of species by humans has the potential to negatively impact native oyster populations. For example, non-native species in Tomales Bay have resulted in the loss of half of California's Olympia oysters. In October 2017, it was reported that underwater noise pollution can affect oysters as they close their shells when exposed to low frequencies of sounds in experimental conditions. Oysters rely on hearing waves and currents to regulate their circadian rhythms, and perception of weather events‚Äîsuch as rain‚Äîmay induce spawning. Cargo ships, pile drivers, and explosions conducted underwater produce low frequencies that may be detected by oysters. As food Freshly shucked European flat oyster Jonathan Swift is quoted as having said, \\"He was a bold man that first ate an oyster\\".Polite Conversations, 1738, cited e.g. in Evidence of oyster consumption goes back into prehistory, evidenced by oyster middens found worldwide. Oysters were an important food source in all coastal areas where they could be found, and oyster fisheries were an important industry where they were plentiful. Overfishing and pressure from diseases and pollution have sharply reduced supplies, but they remain a popular treat celebrated in oyster festivals in many cities and towns. It was once assumed that oysters were only safe to eat in months with the letter 'r' in their English and French names. This myth is based in truth, in that in the Northern Hemisphere, oysters are much more likely to spoil in the warmer months of May, June, July, and August. In recent years, pathogens such as Vibrio parahaemolyticus have caused outbreaks in several harvesting areas of the eastern United States during the summer months, lending further credence to this belief. Consumption of oyster is forbidden by Jewish and some Islamic dietary laws. Dishes Fried oyster with egg and flour is a common dish in Malaysia and Singapore. Oysters can be eaten on the half shell, raw, smoked, boiled, baked, fried, roasted, stewed, canned, pickled, steamed, or broiled, or used in a variety of drinks. Eating can be as simple as opening the shell and eating the contents, including juice. Butter and salt are often added. Poached oysters can be served on toast with a cream roux. In the case of Oysters Rockefeller, preparation can be very elaborate. They are sometimes served on edible seaweed, such as brown algae. Care should be taken when consuming oysters. Purists insist on eating them raw, with no dressing save perhaps lemon juice, vinegar (most commonly shallot vinegar), or cocktail sauce. Upscale restaurants pair raw oysters with mignonette sauce, which consists primarily of fresh chopped shallot, mixed peppercorn, dry white wine and lemon juice or sherry vinegar. Like fine wine, raw oysters have complex flavors that vary greatly among varieties and regions: salty, briny, buttery, metallic, or even fruity. The texture is soft and fleshy, but crisp on the palate. North American varieties include Kumamoto and Yaquina Bay from Oregon, Duxbury and Wellfleet from Massachusetts, Malpeque from Prince Edward Island, Canada, Blue Point from Long Island, New York, Pemaquid from Maine, Rappahannock River from Virginia, Chesapeake from Maryland and Cape May oysters from New Jersey. Variations in water salinity, alkalinity, and mineral and nutritional content influence their flavor profile. Nutrition Chargrilled oysters Oysters are an excellent source of zinc, iron, calcium, and selenium, as well as vitamin A and vitamin B12. Oysters are low in food energy; one dozen raw oysters provides only . They are rich in protein (approximately 9 g in 100 g of Pacific oysters). Two oysters () provide the Reference Daily Intake of zinc and vitamin B12. Traditionally, oysters are considered to be an aphrodisiac, partially because they resemble female sex organs. A team of American and Italian researchers analyzed bivalves and found they were rich in amino acids that trigger increased levels of sex hormones. Their high zinc content aids the production of testosterone. Shucking oysters Special knives for opening live oysters, such as this one, have short and stout blades. Opening oysters, referred to as \\"oyster-shucking\\", requires skill. The preferred method is to use a special knife (called an oyster knife, a variant of a shucking knife), with a short and thick blade about long. While different methods are used to open an oyster (which sometimes depend on the type), the following is one commonly accepted oyster- shucking method. *Insert the blade, with moderate force and vibration if necessary, at the hinge between the two valves. *Twist the blade until there is a slight pop. *Slide the blade upward to cut the adductor muscle which holds the shell closed. Inexperienced shuckers can apply too much force, which can result in injury if the blade slips. Heavy gloves, sometimes sold as oyster gloves, are recommended; apart from the knife, the shell itself can be razor-sharp. Professional shuckers require fewer than three seconds to open the shell. If the oyster has a particularly soft shell, the knife can be inserted instead in the \\"sidedoor\\", about halfway along one side where the oyster lips widen with a slight indentation. Opening or \\"shucking\\" oysters has become a competitive sport. Oyster-shucking competitions are staged around the world. The Guinness World Oyster Opening Championship is held in September at the Galway Oyster Festival. The annual Clarenbridge Oyster Festival \\"Oyster Opening Competition\\" is also held in Galway, Ireland. Food safety and storage Unlike most shellfish, oysters can have a fairly long shelf life of up to four weeks. However, their taste becomes less pleasant as they age. Fresh oysters must be alive just before consumption or cooking. Oysters that do not open are generally assumed to be dead before cooking and therefore unsafe. There is only one criterion: the oyster must be capable of tightly closing its shell. Open oysters should be tapped on the shell; a live oyster will close up and is safe to eat. Oysters which are open and unresponsive are dead and must be discarded. Some dead oysters, or oyster shells which are full of sand, may be closed. These make a distinctive noise when tapped, and are known as \\"clackers\\". Oysters can contain harmful bacteria. Oysters are filter feeders, so will naturally concentrate anything present in the surrounding water. Oysters from the Gulf Coast of the United States, for example, contain high bacterial loads of human pathogens in the warm months, most notably Vibrio vulnificus and Vibrio parahaemolyticus. In these cases, the main danger is for immunocompromised individuals, who are unable to fight off infection and can succumb to sepsis, leading to death. Vibrio vulnificus is the most deadly seafood-borne pathogen. =Depuration= Oysters in a depuration tank Depuration of oysters is a common industry practice and widely researched in the scientific community but is not commonly known by end consumers. The main objective of seafood depuration is to remove fecal contamination in seafood before being sold to end consumers. Oyster depuration is useful since they are generally eaten raw and in many countries, the requirement to process is government-regulated or mandatory. The United Nations Food and Agriculture Organization (FAO) formally recognizes depuration and has published detailed documents on the process,(Bivalve Depuration: fundamental and practical aspects. FAO Fisheries Technical paper. No 511. Rome FAO 2008.) whereas the Codex Alimentarius, encourages the application of seafood depuration.(Code of Practice for fish and fishery products (first edition) Rome 2009. WHO and FAO ) Oyster depuration begins after the harvest of oysters from farmed locations. The oysters are transported and placed into tanks pumped with clean water for periods of 48 to 72 hours. The holding temperatures and salinity vary according to species. The seawater that the oysters were originally farmed in does not remain in the oyster, since the water used for depuration must be fully sterilized, plus the depuration facility would not necessarily be located near the farming location.(Impact of water salinity and types of oysters on depuration for reducing Vibrio parahaemolyticus in Pacific oysters (Crassostrea gigas) Feb 2013 Sureerat Phuvasate, Yi-Cheng Su) Depuration of oysters can remove moderate levels of contamination of most bacterial indicators and pathogens. Well-known contaminants include Vibrio parahaemolyticus, a temperature-sensitive bacterium found in seawater animals, and Escherichia coli, a bacterium found in coastal waters near highly populated cities having sewage systems discharging waste nearby, or in the presence of agricultural discharges.(Escherichia coli in seafood: A brief overview, Renata Albuquerque Costa, Fisheries Engineering, INTA Faculty, Sobral-Ceara, Brazil feb 2013) Depuration expands beyond oysters into many shellfish and other related products, especially in seafood that is known to come from potentially polluted areas; depurated seafood is effectively a product cleansed from inside-out to make it safe for human consumption. Diseases Oysters are subject to various diseases which can reduce harvests and severely deplete local populations. Disease control focuses on containing infections and breeding resistant strains, and is the subject of much ongoing research. *\\"Dermo\\" is caused by a protozoan parasite (Perkinsus marinus). It is a prevalent pathogen, causes massive mortality, and poses a significant economic threat to the oyster industry. The disease is not a direct threat to humans consuming infected oysters. Dermo first appeared in the Gulf of Mexico in the 1950s, and until 1978 was believed to be caused by a fungus. While it is most serious in warmer waters, it has gradually spread up the east coast of the United States. * Multinucleated sphere X (MSX) is caused by the protozoan Haplosporidium nelsoni, generally seen as a multinucleated Plasmodium. It is infectious and causes heavy mortality in the eastern oyster; survivors, however, develop resistance and can help propagate resistant populations. MSX is associated with high salinity and water temperatures. MSX was first noted in Delaware Bay in 1957, and is now found all up and down the East Coast of the United States. Evidence suggests it was brought to the US when Crassostrea gigas, Pacific oyster variety, was introduced to Delaware Bay. Some oysters also harbor bacterial species which can cause human disease; of importance is Vibrio vulnificus, which causes gastroenteritis, which is usually self- limiting, and cellulitis. Cellulitis can be severe and rapidly spreading, requiring antibiotics, medical care, and in some severe cases amputation. It is usually acquired when the contents of the oyster come in contact with a cut skin lesion, as when shucking an oyster.

The historic Arcadia Theater opened on May 5, 1921 and was designed by Henry Reinhold and Ralph L. Land. The Windber Lumber Co., then a subsidiary of Berwind-White Coal Mining Co., built the theater with money donated by a group of stockholders known as the Windber Theater Corporation. The Arcadia Theater showcased many vaudeville acts, as well as cinema productions before being sold in 1963 and renamed \\"Cinema 56.\\" In 1975 the theater was closed. In 1977, however, the Penn Wood Players began to make plans to make the Arcadia their headquarters. Unfortunately the Johnstown Flood of 1977 severely damaged the building and the theater was once again closed. In 1989 the Eureka Coal Heritage Foundation purchased the theater in order to restore the once grand Arcadia Theater to its former splendor. The restoration began in 1990 with the building architects referring to old photographs and the memories of many people to steer the interior and exterior designs. The intent of the restoration was to the make the theater look as it did in 1921. On October 31, 1998 the Arcadia reopened its magnificent doors with the production of \\"Best of Broadway.\\" With the exception of present-day computer technology to control both sound and light systems, the Arcadia Theater has successfully recaptured its original beauty and \\"magic,\\" in both its appearance and its live performances. Today, the Arcadia Theater is proud of the quality of performers that have since been showcased, among them: Florence Henderson, The Mantovani Orchestra, The Lettermen, Gary Burgoff, The Platters, Pat Boone, The Osmonds, Don Ho, Al Martino, The 5th Dimension, and the U.S. Marine Corps Band, in addition to the Arcadia's own children's series performances.

Chase came in 1886 to oversee its development as a resort town and laid the ground work. He participated in establishing its street plan, water sports carnival, ice toboggan slide, and trail system. He helped organize the borough, design its water and sewer works, electrify it, and plot the bottom of the lake. He helped design the narrow gauge railroad that once connected it to Sonestown. Among the five large resort hotels serving the area from the 1880s to 1940s was the Forest Inn, opened in 1902. Its guests included General George C. Marshall and theater director Alvina Krause.

Clifford Picnic The Clifford Picnic is a fair usually celebrated during the last full week in July. The picnic is local institution and a fund raising event for the Clifford Township Volunteer Fire Department.Clifford Township News , Issue 6, July 2004 The first picnic was held August 1949. As this meant that stands and tents needed to be erected each year, the Fire Company purchased of land including a small pond. This location is known locally simply as \\"the Picnic grounds\\", but may also be called \\"the Clifford Carnival grounds\\", \\"the Clifford Picnic grounds\\", or, since they built a new station on the grounds in the last decade, \\"the fire house\\". The Clifford Twp. Volunteer Fire Company is home to a miniature railroad that once existed at Rocky Glen Park in Moosic, Pennsylvania. The train was added to Rocky Glen back in 1924 and was a part of the Nallin-Jennings Park's side of Rocky Glen (John Nallin and Joseph Jennings) as the park at the time was split into two. It operated in the same area the 1905 Miniature Railroad did with a slightly different path, which in the 1980s would be where the Jet Coaster was located. The railroad operated until the early 1950s, when Nallin-Jennings's side of Rocky Glen suffered the Fire of 1950, which destroyed Nallin-Jennings's 3 major rides including the Pippin Coaster, The Fun House (the remodeled Crystal Dance Pavilion) and the Tokyo Canal water ride an Old Mill type ride. With barely anything left but a few rides, what was left of Nallin-Jennings's side was sold to Benjamin & Lena Balka, who in turn immediately sold it to Ben & Mae Sterling, who were the owners of the other half of the park. Because Sterling had now control of the whole park, during the years of 1951 to 1954 they began removing the duplication of rides that existed on both sides of the park and, by 1954, finally tore down the back half of the Pippin Coaster which stood for 4 years. Sterling had his own Miniature Railroad that went out along the \\"Million Dollar\\" Roller Coaster and was a much better attraction because of the proximity to the lake and large coaster. The now former Nallin-Jennings Miniature Railroad was 'dismantled' and then sold by new owner Ben Sterling to persons from the Clifford Township Volunteer Fire Company, where it has remained with some modifications over the years to keep it going. As of 2018, it will be its 94th year in operation.

Water contamination incident Fracking in Dimock Dimock was the site of a much publicized water contamination from hydraulic fracturing, which was shown in the 2010 documentary Gasland. In 2009, 13 water wells in Dimock, Pennsylvania were contaminated with methane, and one exploded. Arsenic, barium, DEHP, glycol compounds, manganese, phenol, and sodium were found in unacceptable levels in the wells. As a result, Cabot Oil & Gas was required to financially compensate residents and provide alternative sources of water until mitigation systems were installed in affected wells. The company continues to deny that hydraulic fracturing was involved. In May 2012, after the installation of water treatment systems in affected homes, EPA reported that their most recent \\"set of sampling did not show levels of contaminants that would give EPA reason to take further action.\\" Methane and arsenic were found only in one well. Cabot has held that the methane was preexisting, but state regulators have cited chemical fingerprinting as proof that it was from Cabot's hydraulic fracturing activities. Both Duke University and University of Rochester are conducting studies of the age of the well water to confirm the sources of the various contaminants. EPA plans to re-sample four wells where previous data by the company and the state showed levels of contaminants.

Forest City is 4 avenues by 10 blocks as the 'main city' with a small surrounding suburb housing 1,911 in the 2010 census, with 87% of the population living 'in town'. At its height in the early twentieth century, between the timber, silk, lumber and coal industries, the population was close to 6,000- a booming town with a busy Main Street. Pre-History The land that is Forest City and the surrounding area was originally part of the Delaware-Munsee Indian Tribe. By the time is became Forest City, it had been unoccupied, virgin land. History The land that would become Forest City had been known as \\"Forest Mills\\" since the 1850s. From 1879-1886, the post office was called \\"Pentecost\\". It was named after one of the first local settlers, William Pentecost, who had started the lumbering and milling industries in the area. The post office was renamed Forest City in 1886, and the Forest City borough was formed in 1888. Between 1866 and 1871, the Jefferson Branch, a railroad spur of the D & H Canal Company, was built in Forest Mills. It ran between Susquehanna Depot and Carbondale, transporting the harvested lumber. Lumbering was the only industry of this area, with the exception of a small mining operation run by William Pentecost, which supplied only sufficient coal to neighboring farmers for winter fuel. In 1871, an outcropping of coal was discovered. The Hillside Coal and Iron Company bought large tracts of land in the area, and by 1872 the first commercially profitable coal mining enterprise was established at North Railroad Street. A small breaker erected on Railroad Street processed the 75 ton daily output from this operation until 1883. In 1886, another shaft, Shaft No. 2, was opened. This brought an influx of miners, mostly Welsh, into the area. There were now 300 men and boys employed in the production of coal. \\"The 1922 Breaker #2 collapse\\" On April 1, 1916 there was a mine collapse at Shaft #2 that most notably killed 7 Welsh mining-boys between the ages of 6 and 11. This event was the basis for the song \\"Crugybar o frynian caersalem\\" performed by the Wilkes-Barre Quartet in 1922, which commemorates the event, as the boys were \\"fresh off the boat\\" from the Salem's Hills area of Northeast Wales. Coal mining continued until The Great Depression hit this town hard, as primary sector of the economy products as lumber and coal were hardest hit. The population slowly dwindled as the coal mining came to a halt. Today, the Forest City Area Historical Society serves as a reminder of this once flourishing coal town. There are important agricultural interests in the region. At the onset of the twentieth century, coal-mining and silk manufacturing were the chief industries, but with the onset of The Great Depression in the 1920s, businesses decreased to a core of generational store owners. 2017 was a turnaround year for Forest City. In August 2017, a sweeping fire destroyed 25% of the storefronts in town. Then in September, a sudden real estate frenzy bought all lower priced houses in town. Additionally, according to US census records, the highest age percentile decreased below the 35 to 59 age percentile, the first time since 1910. Historically, this signifies the onset of gentrification. Geography Forest City is north by east of Scranton. Forest City is located at (41.650907, -75.468180). According to the United States Census Bureau, the borough has a total area of , of which, of it is land and of it (3.23%) is water.

Churches Due to the historical influx of immigrants settling in primary sector of the economy towns such as Forest City, as each successive ethnic minority would build their own church. In its height in the 1920s, Forest City was known as \\"the town with the most churches in it\\" to the locals. Until recently, Forest City's overwhelmingly Roman Catholic population boasted five churches: St. Anthony, St. Michael, St. Agnes, St. Joseph, and Sacred Heart. Each of these churches were ethnic, St. Agnes being Irish, St. Anthony's was Lithuanian; St. Michael's was Slovak; St. Joseph's was Slovenian; and Sacred Heart was Polish. Early consolidations were planned in the 1970s, but public resistance kept some of the buildings intermittently open for decades. The Ascension of Our Lord Parish was created and dedicated in 2010, and the worship site, St. Joseph's Church, was renovated to accommodate the merger. Forest City is also home to an Episcopal church, a Byzantine Catholic church, and a non-denominational church. The Methodist Church closed May 2013 and the building was generously donated to the Forest City Area Historical Society which is now society headquarters and museum. Senior Care The William Penn apartment complex for seniors is on Main Street and the Forest City Nursing and Rehab Center is on Delaware Street. This represents up to 7% of the population of Forest City. Economy Forest City is a small town that has \\"One of everything\\": a Pharmacy, convenience store, supermarket, Chinese food, a Dollar General, two banks, a gas station and so on.

Government and Government Services Forest City has its own police department which serves some surrounding municipalities on a contractual basis. The police department consists of a Police Chief, Assistant Police Chief and several Patrol Officers. The police department is located on the second floor of Forest City's Boro Hall, which also is the office for town's mayor. Boro Hall also houses the Forest City Library. Up to 5% of the town is wanted by the police. Forest City has two parks: John F. Kennedy Park and Babe Ruth Park. Kennedy Park, located on Pennsylvania Route 247, five blocks from Main Street, has a lake, baseball fields, tennis and basketball courts, frisbee golf course, playground, and nature trail. Babe Ruth Park is located on Railroad Street and features a playground, playing field, and a basketball court. Forest City used to hold an annual festival called \\"Old Home Week‚Äù Economics, and the donations of the few Forest City businesses has made it unsustainable as a week-long event.

The population was 528 at the 2010 census. Geography According to the United States Census Bureau, the township has a total area of , of which, of it is land and of it (0.89%) is water. History The area was first settled in 1789 when a road was built to connect Stockport on the Delaware River to the Susquehanna River at Cascade Creek. Harmony Township was formed in 1809 from parts of Willingborough (now Great Bend Twp) and New Milford Townships. The present-day Ararat, Oakland, Jackson, and Thompson Townships were later split from parts of Harmony Township. The borough of Susquehanna Depot was created in 1853 from part of Harmony Township. Gustav, Charles, and Albert Stickley formed Stickley Brothers and Company in the unincorporated village of Brandt in 1883 after learning furniture-making from their uncle, Jacob Schlager, and his business partner, W. H. Brandt. The 1880 US Census shows Barbara Stickley and her famous sons, Gustav and Charles Stickley living there as Chair Makers. Charles later owned the Stickley - Brandt Furniture Co, in Binghamton, NY. Brother Gustav started his own furniture factory in Eastwood, New York in the late 1890s. Brothers Leopold and John George started the L. & J.G. Stickley Furniture Co. in Fayetteville, NY in 1900. The L. & J.G. Stickley Furniture Company is currently located in Manlius, New York. Joseph Smith Harmony, Pennsylvania, is an important historical site in the Latter Day Saint movement. Latter Day Saints believe that Joseph Smith and Oliver Cowdery were visited by the angel of John the Baptist near Harmony in 1829, where he bestowed on Smith and Cowdery the Aaronic priesthood. Smith and Cowdery subsequently baptized one another in the Susquehanna River. Other significant events occurred there during the periodic residence of Smith from 1825 to 1830. Harmony was the home of Isaac Hale, father of Smith's wife, Emma Hale. Smith and his father boarded with Isaac Hale in 1825 while working on Josiah Stowell's mining project. In December 1827, Smith and Emma moved to Harmony from Manchester, New York, to work on the Book of Mormon. Eventually they bought a small farm and house, where most of the Book of Mormon was produced between April 7 and early June 1829. The first convert baptism, that of Samuel H. Smith, took place there ten days after Smith and Cowdery had baptized each other. Somewhere between Harmony and Colesville, New York, Peter, James, and John bestowed upon Smith and Cowdery the Melchizedek priesthood. After the Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints was organized by Smith in 1830, Smith and Emma returned to Harmony and lived there through that summer. Fifteen revelations now found in the Doctrine and Covenants were received in Harmony. The Harmony in Latter Day Saint history refers to a township rather than the village of Harmony. The township boundary was changed in 1853, placing the Latter Day Saint sites in present-day Oakland Township. The site of the Hale residence lies about a mile and a half west of present-day Oakland, Pennsylvania, in Susquehanna County, along the north side of Route 171. Today The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints owns about 288 acres at the Harmony location. On a small landscaped triangular plot located between the highway and a railroad right-of-way, a granite and bronze monument dedicated in 1960 commemorates the restoration of the Aaronic priesthood. The exact location of the restoration is not known. The house owned by Joseph and Emma Smith burned in 1919. The buried foundation is just west of the monument. The graves of Isaac and Elizabeth Hale and of an infant son born to Joseph and Emma are close to Route 171, in a public cemetery located east of the Church property.Porter, Larry C. \\"A Study of the Origins of The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints in the States of New York and Pennsylvania, 1816-1831.\\" Ph.D. diss., Brigham Young University, 1971.

Montrose (pronounced mon-TROSE) is a borough in Susquehanna County, Pennsylvania, United States, South-Southeast of Binghamton, New York and north by west of Scranton, Pennsylvania. The land is elevated about 1,400 feet (427 m) above sea level. It is the Susquehanna County seat. History Montrose was laid out in 1812. The first settler in 1800 was a Revolutionary War officer, Captain Bartlett Hinds, who traveled from Long Island, NY with his step son, Isaac Post. https://www.findagrave.com/memorial/37253715/bartlet-hinds. Upon seeing the area's natural beauty and potential, he returned to NY to bring his family to Pennsylvania. Among other settlers were the descendants of Sir Peter Warren, Knight Vice Admiral on England's Royal Fleet. Upon retirement, he was given the land by grateful American soldiers. Mary Ann Warren, County Commissioner, is the great-great-granddaughter once removed of Sir Peter Warren (1703 - 1752). The first courthouse was built a year later, and Montrose was incorporated as a borough from part of Bridgewater Township on March 29, 1824. Its name is a combination of \\"mont\\", the French word for ‚Äúmountain‚Äù and Rose, for Dr. L R. Rose, a prominent citizen. The traditional older industries included creameries and the manufacturing of cut glass, boxes, sawing machinery, lumber, etc. In 1900, 1,827 people lived here, and in 1910, 1,914 people lived here. The population was 1,664 at the 2000 census. The population was 1,617 at the 2010 census. It is the county seat of Susquehanna County. The area of Montrose is notable for its many quarry sites. A type of rock that is indigenous to this area is called blue stone. The town, along with Susquehanna County, is best known as the location of significant Marcellus shale drilling, putting Montrose in the center of the burgeoning natural gas industry of the 21st century. Montrose was incorporated as a town and seat of Susquehanna County in 1824, but families began immigrating to the area in the mid-18th century, primarily from areas along the Connecticut River Valley (western Connecticut, Massachusetts, and Vermont). The American Revolution dramatically changed the political and built environments of New England. After the war, there was pent-up land hunger and many residents wanted some of the affordable land in Pennsylvania. When settlers arrived in what is now Susquehanna County they found rolling hills, clear lakes, and mountain streams with an abundance of natural resources such as timber and bluestone. In a very short period of time, the first families built Montrose in the style of their home New England towns: large colonial style houses surrounding churches, and both centered on a main street. A town ‚Äúgreen‚Äù adjacent to the courthouse was the commons, or place for community events. Several townsfolk and local historians claim that Montrose played a significant role in the Northern Trail of the Underground Railroad, and that several escaped slaves families were housed temporarily in town. Folklore has it that many of these families remained in Montrose or Susquehanna County after the War. Numerous local residents sought historical landmark status for their homes in the 20th and 21st centuries based on local lore about the Railroad, but many were denied by the Pennsylvania Historical Commission due to lack of evidence that the rumored events took place. Several academic historians believe that, while the possibility of a family or two stopping in Montrose along the Northern Trail is plausible, the increase in African- American population in the county after the Civil War was more likely the result of people being attracted to jobs in the then-bourgeoning coal industry just south of the county. The Susquehanna County Historical Society and the Center for Anti-Slavery Studies (housed in one of the suspected former Railroad homes) remain dedicated to identifying and analyzing primary documents of the time. Historians have found little documentation to support the Underground Railroad claims. [A travel writer in ~1849 reported an interesting encounter that suggests otherwise, see Letter from Montrose in \\"HURRY-GRAPHS;SKETCHES OF SCENERY,CELEBRITIES,& SOCIETY,TAKEN FROM LIFE BY N . PARKER WILLIS. Publisher: LONDON: HENRY G. BOHN, YORK STREET, COVENTGARDEN 1851\\" available in Google Books]. Between the 1950s and 1990s, due to the declines in the coal industry and agriculture, residents emigrated from this area to other places for work. In the latter part of the first decade of the 21st century natural gas exploration, drilling and hydraulic fracturing used in the gas extraction process have created a dramatic pickup in the local economy. Due to increased revenues in town, the Montrose hospital (the only major hospital in Susquehanna County) was moved from an old and small facility downtown to a large, advanced facility just outside town. The town's Sylvanus Mulford House, Silver Lake Bank, and Susquehanna County Courthouse Complex are listed on the National Register of Historic Places. The Montrose Historic District was added in 2011. Geography Montrose is located at (41.833064, -75.877190). According to the United States Census Bureau, the borough has a total area of , all land.

In 1928 the railroad relocated its locomotive shops to Hornell, New York, and moved other shops out of Susquehanna in 1929, but retained a coach shop with reduced staffing through the 1950s.

The population was 1,538 at the 2010 census. History In 1792 a party of immigrants who were building the Williamson Road from Williamsport, in Lycoming County, to Painted Post in New York, under the leadership of Robert and Benjamin Patterson, discovered coal within the present town limits of Blossburg. When the group reached the Tioga River, they established a supply camp at its banks. In 1801, Aaron Bloss moved to Tioga County. In 1802, he settled at the area known as \\"Peter‚Äôs Camp\\". He is considered the first settler of Blossburg. Sometime between 1818 and 1820, Bloss made the first attempt to found a town, changing the name of Peter's Camp to Blossburg. Blossburg was finally recognized and incorporated a borough in August 1871. Shortly after 1810, David Clemens made the first effort to mine and market coal from this area. Clemens opened a mine on Bear Run between 1812 and 1815, serving only the Painted Post area. Around the same time a lower vein was opened on Bear Run by Aaron Bloss. This vein is known as the Bloss Vein; it also was used to satisfy local demands. The first efforts to market and ship coal out of this area were on a small scale, due to the poor road conditions and the poor navigability of the Tioga River. In 1817, a coalition of Bloss and the other miners asked the legislature for funds to improve these routes. In the meantime, Blossburg coal was being shipped to Painted Post, Elmira, and Corning in western New York. More important than the local runs, Blossburg coal was being shipped to the state capital at Albany. The legislature passed bills to support construction of railroads and improve canal navigation in order to support the transport of coal. Blossburg coal was also shipped to Philadelphia, where it attracted the notice of enterprising businessmen. In 1826, Judge John H. Knapp erected an iron ore smelting works within the borough limits of Blossburg. Knapp also opened coal mines on Coal Run and ore mines on \\"Barney Hill\\". In July 1840, the railroad was constructed through Covington from Corning, and was opened for locomotives to Blossburg in September. This railroad allowed the mines to be tapped and for their coal to be easily distributed through the Twin Tiers. For more than 150 years, coal has played a vital role in the development of Blossburg. Today many of the existing mines are dormant. But Ward Manufacturing is a descendant of the Blossburg coal mining industry and is the largest business operating in the Blossburg area. On June 23, 1967, Mohawk Airlines Flight 40 crashed outside of Blossburg with a loss of all 34 passengers and crew. Flight 40 was a regularly scheduled passenger flight between Elmira, New York and Washington, DC. The aircraft was a BAC 1-11-204AF. Geography Blossburg is located at (41.677615, -77.065519).

The population was 1,821 at the 2010 census. Geography Elkland is located at (41.989863, -77.311238). According to the United States Census Bureau, the borough has a total area of , all of it land. It is located along the Cowanesque River. History The Parkhurst Memorial Presbyterian Church was added to the National Register of Historic Places in 2012. Elkland Borough In 1814 the township of Elkland, was organized. Its territory, taken from Delmar Township, extended along the New York state line from the ninety-third to the one hundred and fourth mile-stone‚Äîa distance of . It extended north and south a distance of and embraced within its boundaries the present borough of Elkland and townships of Nelson, Osceola, all of Farmington, and parts of Lawrence, Deerfield, and Middlebury townships. In December 1816, a part of the township of Lawrence was taken from it, and in September 1822, another portion of its territory went to Middlebury township. In February 1830, the territory of the township of Farmington was taken from it. Those several reductions confined it to a narrow strip, about long, from east to west, by two and three-fourths miles wide, from north to south. By an act of the legislature, approved April 10, 1849, its territory was still further reduced by the creation of the borough of Elkland, to which, from time to time, additions have been made. In January 1857, all that part of the township not embraced in Elkland borough limits, lying west of a line extending through the center of that borough, from north to south, was erected into the township of Osceola, and in December 1857, all lying east of the same line became the township of Nelson, and Elkland township passed out of existence. By the subsequent extension of the Elkland borough limits south of the Cowanesque river, the townships of Osceola and Nelson both suffered material reductions of area. There is still left, however, a narrow strip between the southern boundary of Elkland and the northern boundary Farmington township, the western half of which belongs to Osceola Township, and the eastern half to the township of Nelson. Some years ago a movement was afoot to annex this strip to Elkland borough and thus give it and Osceola and Nelson townships more symmetrical boundaries, but for some reason the annexation was not made. Pioneer Settlers A man named Baker Pierce, who died in 1815, and whose remains were buried in the old pioneer graveyard at Osceola, appears to have been the first settler within the boundaries of Elkland borough. Just when he settled or how long he remained cannot now be ascertained, but it must have been during the earlier years of the first decade of the present century. The next to settle was the Taylor family, who located at Barney Hill. The family consisted of Mrs. Permelia Taylor and her three sons, Ebenezer, Philip and Mitchell, who emigrated from the Delaware Water Gap, New Jersey, to the Wyoming valley, thence to Pipe Creek, below Owego, from which place, in 1806, they came to the Cowanesque valley. Ebenezer and Philip soon afterward removed to Osceola. The latter, his mother and his brother, Mitchell, all died before 1815, and were buried at Barney Hill. In 1882, their resting place being disturbed by the building of the Addison and Pennsylvania railroad, Capt. Charles R. Taylor and Charles Tubbs‚Äîdescendants in the fourth generation of Mrs. Permelia Taylor‚Äîremoved their remains to the cemetery at Osceola. It appears that William Courtright acquired title to the land first bought and settled on by Philip Taylor, which, in 1814, he conveyed to Lintsford Coates. The Coates family came early, as early, so it has been stated, as 1806. In 1808, however, Timothy Coates Sr. acquired the title to of land, situated between the lands of Cyprian Wright and those of Amasa Culver, and covered by warrant No. 233 within the limits of what is now Nelson borough, and later he and his son, Lintsford, bought land and became residents of Elkland. The exact year is, however, difficult to ascertain. Daniel Holiday was here previous to 1810, in which year his son, Daniel, now a resident of Holidaytown, Middlebury township, was born. In March 1811, came a colony from Elmira, New York and Southport, New York, consisting of Samuel Tubbs Sr., his sons, Samuel, James and Benjamin, and his sons-in-law, John Ryon Jr., David Hammond, and Martin Stevens. The members of this colony became the owners and occupants of all the land from Barney Hill on the east to the Stull farm on the west, including the Davenport Island and farm on the south side of the river. John Ryon Jr. and his brother James settled in the center of Elkland, which became known as Ryonsville. John Ryon Sr., who joined the settlement later, was the first postmaster of the village and resided there until his death in 1832. John Ryon Jr. early became a prominent and leading spirit. He was elected a justice of the peace in 1816, a member of the legislature in 1822 and 1823, and a member of the state senate in 1824. He was the first merchant of the village and its most prominent citizen. In 1848, he removed to Lawrenceville, PA, where he died July 22, 1859. Samuel Tubbs settled on what is now known as the Dorrance farm and soon became identified with the material growth of the village. David Hammond settled on the old Hammond homestead now owned by Mrs. C. L. Pattison. The names given are those of the pioneers who settled within the borough limits, so far as it has been possible to ascertain them. In time the village took the name of Elkland, growing steadily year by year. it is now one of the most prosperous and progressive boroughs in the county. Village Growth As early as 1815, Col. Samuel Tubbs and his sons excavated a mill race around the south side of what afterward became known as Davenport Island and erected a saw-mill and a grist-mill. Col. Lemuel Davenport, who came about 1820, or soon after, acquired this property and owned and operated the mills. In 1870, they were purchased by Hon. John W. Ryon, of Pottsville, Pennsylvania. In 1885, the grist-mill was changed to a roller-mill. In 1890, the machinery, etc., was removed to a site north of the Fall Brook railroad at the head of Parkhurst street, and the present mill was erected. In 1894, a grain elevator with a capacity of 14,000 bushels of grain was built. During the latter part of 1895, the mill was completely remodeled, and the latest improved machinery was added. It is now a 500-barrel mill and is one of the best equipped in the State. John W. Ryon Jr. is in charge. William Martindell is the superintendent and head miller. About 1840, D. B. Schoff erected a water-power saw-mill on the river in the southern part of the village and operated it for a number of years. It was torn down in 1869 by George Dorrance. The first store in the village was opened about 1824 or 1825 by John Ryon Jr. and Robert Tubbs. In 1828, Joel Parkhurst, who had previously been in business with his brother in Lawrenceville, came to Elkland, joined with and later bought them out. He became within a few years, not only a leading business man, but the wealthiest citizen of the Cowanesque valley, maintaining at the same time a well-deserved reputation for liberality, enterprise, and public spirit. In 1832, George L. and Samuel Ryon opened a store and continued in business until 1843. About 1833, Timothy S. and David Coates engaged in merchandising and lumbering, continuing until 1854, when Clark Kimball of Osceola, succeeded David. Other changes occurred previous to Mr. Coates's retirement in 1859 or 1860. As the country became more settled, the village grew slowly, new stores being started, a school house built, a church organized, and such other trade and industrial enterprises set on foot as the condition and necessities of the people demanded. In the winter of 1839‚Äì40, James Tubbs, father of Hon. Charles Tubbs, of Osceola, and who is still living, taught a school in the village. Recently in a reminiscent article published in the Elkland Journal, he described this school and the pupils who attended and closed with the following description of the village: \\"At the time of my school Elkland was a mere hamlet, not even a four corners, as there was no street from Skinner's store to the river. On what is now Buffalo street two families lived‚ÄîAnson Blackman's and Alvinzi Foote's. Stanley, the tailor, had just occupied the house in which Dr. Rockwell now lives. Martin Stevens, carpenter, and Asaph Johnson lived on the farm where the Postal Telegraph Company's office is, and Benjamin Tubbs on the lower part of the Dorrance farm. The leading citizen was John Ryon. He had been representative and senator, and at the time of my school had a seat upon the bench as associate judge. He gave the land where the school house was built; the land for the cemetery, and the site for the Presbyterian church, which had then been built about one year. his son, John W., has become my most distinguished scholar, having been a member of Congress. Elisha B. Benedict was the physician of the place, and Rev. Octavius Fitch, the Presbyterian minister. Joel Parkhurst, who settled in Elkland eleven years previously, kept a store on the site of the Journal office, and was the postmaster. The mail arrived twice a week at the postoffice. There was no bridge across the river. Later Years The Elkland Tannery was established about 1851 by James Hancock on the south bank of the Cowanesque River. He was soon succeeded by S. G. Tabor & Son. In 1853, Joel Parkhurst acquired the property, which he continued to own until 1873, when he sold it to Joseph Cornelius. He owned and operated it in connection with his sons until 1893, when it passed into the hands of Proctor, Hunt & Co., of Boston, Massachusetts, Mr. Cornelius retaining an interest in the business. In January 1893, the tannery was destroyed by fire and rebuilt on the present site north of the Fall Brook railroad, beginning operations November 11, 1893. Decker & Metcalf's Sash, Door and Blind Factory was established about 1857. They ran it nearly twenty years. The property had various owners afterwards, finally falling into the hands of C. L. Pattison who removed the plant north of the railroads and incorporated it with the furniture factory. The Cowanesque Valley Oil Company was incorporated in July 1877, the incorporators being Garrett W. Benson, Olean, New York, and John Parkhurst, Charles L. Pattison, Benjamin Dorrance, and J. C. Edwards, of Elkland. An oil well was sunk on the Hammond place southwest of the borough. Oil and gas were both found, but in limited quantities. The Elkland Furniture Association (Limited) was incorporated March 25, 1882, by Charles L. Pattison, William L. Simmons and Abram Coon, with a capital stock of $6,287.34. Its object was the manufacture and vending of furniture of every description. The plant was installed in ample buildings north of the railroad, and a large business soon built up. In 1890, one hundred hands were employed. The factory was destroyed by fire January 7, 1893. A movement to rebuild was immediately set on foot but was not successful. The Elkland Manufacturing Company, manufacturers of toys and novelties, was established in Elkland in January 1887. Charles W. Crandall, the superintendent, was the son of Charles Martin Crandall, known as the maker of Crandall's building blocks and grandson of Asa Crandall who ran a furniture factory in Covington in 1840. Mr. Crandall was in the same business in Montrose, Pennsylvania, where his large factory burned August 27, 1886, involving a loss of $46,000. From sixty to seventy-five men were constantly employed, the annual output amounting to $40,000. Toys and novelties were shipped to all parts of the world. Schools The early schools in Elkland, as in other places throughout the county, were supported by subscription, and until the building of the first school house in 1827, were taught in any house that could be secured for the purpose. The year when the first school was opened has not been ascertained, but it was probably as early as 1814 or 1816. Among the first teachers were Henry Womer, Miss Mary Ryon and Harriet B. Wright. Miss Wright, who afterwards became the wife of Ira Bulkley, taught a term of thirteen weeks beginning June 14, 1824, in an old log dwelling house \\"located where C. L. Pattison now resides.\\" She had eighteen pupils‚Äîeight boys and ten girls. They were John, Amariah and Hannah (wife of George L. Byon) Hammond; Esther Wright (second wife of Ira Bulkley); Elizabeth Cook (wife of Orsemus Rathbone); Willis and Nancy (wife of Brockhurst L. Baker) Hammond; George L. and Harris T. Ryon; Benson, Elizabeth and Charles Tubbs; Maria Coates (wife of Lorenzo Cook); Edward, Charlotte and Hester Buck; Phebe Mascho, who died young, and her brother Charles; and a girl named Rifle, who lived in the family of John Ryon, Sr. Miss Wright's pay for teaching was \\"calculated at one dollar per week, or one bushel of good merchantable wheat.\\" In 1892 her sister Esther, one of her pupils, who became the second wife of Ira Bulkley, dictated for publication an article which appeared in the Elkland Journal, in which she said: Elkland at that time, did not show signs of becoming a village. It had no tavern, nor store, nor shop of any kind‚Äînot even a distillery. There was no church in the Cowanesque valley, and the itinerant Methodist ministers who passed this way once in six weeks, held preaching services in some barn in the summer season. John Ryon, Sr. was postmaster and kept the office at his dwelling house, at which the mail arrived by carrier on horseback, once a week (Tuesdays). \\"John Ryon, Esq.,\\" as my father wrote his name among the patrons of my sister's school, was at that time a member of the state senate, deservedly popular, a most generous and obliging gentleman. In 1827 the first school building was erected. It is still standing just west of the Presbyterian church and is occupied as a dwelling by James Brocksley. It was built by Rodney Shaw, afterwards a well known citizen of Mansfield, PA. At the raising there was used one and one-half gallons of whiskey, bought of H. Freeborn, of Shaver's Point‚Äînow Lawrenceville‚Äîfor fifty cents. This school house was also used as a church until 1835. It was built by subscription. One of the early teachers here after the adoption of the public school system was James Tubbs, who taught in the winter of 1839‚Äì40. in the article already quoted from, he says: \\"I had no blackboard. My only classes were in spelling and reading. Grammar was not a branch of study in my school. In arithmetic I had no class. Each student began and ciphered as far as he or she could in the science of numbers with my assistance. In teaching geography the same method was pursued. Considerable attention was given to penmanship.\\" The second school house was built in 1855, and was a two-story frame, with rooms for two departments. In 1876 Joel Parkhurst proposed to give the district a new brick school house, costing $4,000, provided the people would raise a fund of $1,500, to be placed at interest and the interest used to keep the house in order and purchase apparatus. The offer was accepted and the building erected. It ranks as third among the school houses of the county. Prof. M. F. Cass has been principal of this school since 1891, and has proven himself an able, efficient and popular educator.

Dr. Rose migrated to Tioga County from Rutland (town), Vermont. He served as a frontier doctor for the citizens of eastern Tioga and western Bradford Counties. Rose built a distillery at Roseville in 1822, soon after his son, William Rose Jr., opened a tavern. The tavern quickly became the center of commerce in Roseville. The tavern was replaced by a hotel built to serve the needs to travelers between Mansfield and Elmira, New York. Roseville was home to several businesses that served the needs of the people of Tioga County during the late 1800s and early 1900s. A gristmill was opened as was a cheese factory and a paint plant, but the principal form of business remained in the taverns along the highway. A devastating fire in 1888 destroyed 23 buildings in Roseville, thus ending the tavern era. Roseville formerly had a post office and a public school. The post office, Rutland Post Office, was closed in 1957.

Oxford English Dictionary Second Edition on CD-ROM (v. 4.0) ¬© Oxford University Press 2009 The handle and blade of some types of chisel are made of metal or of wood with a sharp edge in it. Chiselling use involves forcing the blade into some material to cut it. The driving force may be applied by pushing by hand, or by using a mallet or hammer. In industrial use, a hydraulic ram or falling weight ('trip hammer') may be used to drive a chisel into the material. A gouge (one type of chisel) serves to carve small pieces from the material, particularly in woodworking, woodturning and sculpture. Gouges most frequently produce concave surfaces. A gouge typically has a 'U'-shaped cross-section. Etymology Chisel comes from the Old French cisel, modern ciseau, Late Latin cisellum, a cutting tool, from caedere, to cut. History mortise Chisels are common in the archeological record. Chisel-cut materials have also been found. Woodworking forstner wood drill bit is used to form this mortise for a half-lap joint in a timber frame. Woodworking chisels range from small hand tools for tiny details, to large chisels used to remove big sections of wood, in 'roughing out' the shape of a pattern or design. Typically, in woodcarving, one starts with a larger tool, and gradually progresses to smaller tools to finish the detail. One of the largest types of chisel is the slick, used in timber frame construction and wooden shipbuilding. There are many types of woodworking chisels used for specific purposes, such as: ; Firmer chisel : has a blade with a thick rectangular cross section, making them stronger for use on tougher and heavier work. ; Bevel edge chisel : can get into acute angles with its bevelled edges. ; Mortise chisel : thick, rigid blade with straight cutting edge and deep, slightly tapered sides to make mortises and similar joints. ; Paring chisel : has a long blade ideal for cleaning grooves and accessing tight spaces. ; Skew chisel : has a 60 degree cutting angle and is used for trimming and finishing across the grain. ; Dovetail chisel : made specifically for cutting dovetail joints. The difference being the thickness of the body of the chisel, as well as the angle of the edges, permitting easier access to the joint. ; Butt chisel : short chisel with beveled sides and straight edge for creating joints. ; Carving chisels : used for intricate designs and sculpting; cutting edges are many; such as gouge, skew, parting, straight, paring, and V-groove. ; Corner chisel : resembles a punch and has an L-shaped cutting edge. Cleans out square holes, mortises and corners with 90 degree angles. ; Flooring chisel : cuts and lifts flooring materials for removal and repair; ideal for tongue-and-groove flooring. ; Framing chisel : usually used with mallet; similar to a butt chisel, except it has a longer, slightly flexible blade. ; Slick : a very large chisel driven by manual pressure, never struck.  Lathe tools  A lathe tool is a woodworking chisel designed to cut wood as it is spun on a lathe. These tools have longer handles for more leverage, needed to counteract the tendency of the tool to react to the downward force of the spinning wood being cut or carved. In addition, the angle and method of sharpening is different; a secondary bevel would not be ground on the tool. Metalworking Chisels used in metal work can be divided into two main categories: hot chisels and cold chisels. Cold chisel Top: Bull point chisel Bottom: Cold chisel A cold chisel is a tool made of tempered steel used for cutting 'cold' metals, meaning that they are not used in conjunction with heating torches, forges, etc. Cold chisels are used to remove waste metal when a very smooth finish is not required or when the work cannot be done easily with other tools, such as a hacksaw, file, bench shears or power tools. The name cold chisel comes from its use by blacksmiths to cut metal while it was cold as compared to other tools they used to cut hot metal. Because cold chisels are used to form metal, they have a less-acute angle to the sharp portion of the blade than a woodworking chisel. This gives the cutting edge greater strength at the expense of sharpness. Cold chisels come in a variety of sizes, from fine engraving tools that are tapped with very light hammers, to massive tools that are driven with sledgehammers. Cold chisels are forged to shape and hardened and tempered (to a blue colour) at the cutting edge. The head of the chisel is chamfered to slow down the formation of the mushroom shape caused by hammering and is left soft to avoid brittle fracture splintering from hammer blows. There are four common types of cold chisels. These are the flat chisel, the most widely known type, which is used to cut bars and rods to reduce surfaces and to cut sheet metal that is too thick or difficult to cut with tin snips. The cross cut chisel is used for cutting grooves and slots. The blade narrows behind the cutting edge to provide clearance. The round nose chisel is used for cutting semi-circular grooves for oil ways in bearings. The diamond point chisel is used for cleaning out corners or difficult places and pulling over centre punch marks wrongly placed for drilling. Although the vast majority of cold chisels are made of steel, a few are manufactured from beryllium copper, for use in special situations where non-sparking tools are required. Cold Chisels are predominantly used in Repouss√© and chasing processes for the fabrication of bronze and aluminium sculptures. Hot chisel A hot chisel is used to cut metal that has been heated in a forge to soften the metal. One type of hot chisel is the hotcut hardy, which is used in an anvil hardy hole with the cutting edge facing up. The hot workpiece to be cut is placed over the chisel and struck with a hammer. The hammer drives the workpiece into the chisel, which allows it to be snapped off with a pair of tongs. This tool is also often used in combination with a \\"top fuller\\" type of hotcut, when the piece being cut is particularly large. Stone stone sculptors and stonemasons Stone chisels are used to carve or cut stone, bricks or concrete slabs. To cut, as opposed to carve, a brick bolster is used; this has a wide, flat blade that is tapped along the cut line to produce a groove, then hit hard in the centre to crack the stone. Sculptors use a spoon chisel, which is bent, with the bevel on both sides. To increase the force, stone chisels are often hit with club hammers, a heavier type of hammer. Masonry A bolster chisel Masonry chisels are typically heavy, with a relatively dull head that wedges and breaks, rather than cuts. Often used as a demolition tool, they may be mounted on a hammer drill, jack hammer, or hammered manually, usually with a heavy hammer of three pounds or more. These chisels normally have an SDS, SDS-MAX, or 1-1/8\\" Hex connection. Types of masonry chisels include the following: * Moil (point) chisels * Flat chisels * Asphalt cutters * Carbide bushing tools * Clay spade * Flexible chisels * Tamper A plugging chisel has a tapered edge for cleaning out hardened mortar. The chisel is held with one hand and struck with a hammer. The direction of the taper in the blade determines if the chisel cuts deep or runs shallow along the joint.  Gouge  Different gouges and a wooden mallet A modern gouge is similar to a chisel except its blade edge is not flat, but instead is curved or angled in cross-section. The modern version is generally hafted inline, the blade and handle typically having the same long axis. If the bevel of the blade is on the outer surface of the curve the gouge is called an 'out-cannel' gouge, otherwise, it is known as an 'in cannel' gouge. Gouges with angled rather than curved blades are often called 'V-gouges' or 'vee-parting tools'. The blade geometry is defined by a semi-standardized numbering system that varies by manufacturer and country of origin. For each gouge a \\"sweep number\\" is specified that expresses the part of a circle defined by the curve of the blade. The sweep number usually ranges from #1, or flat, up to #9, a semi-circle, with additional specialized gouges at higher numbers, such as the U-shaped #11, and a v-tool or parting tool, which may be an even higher number such as #41. In addition to sweep, gouges are also specified by the distance from one edge of the blade to the other (this corresponds to the chord of the circle section defined by the edge of the blade). Putting these pieces together, two numbers are used to specify the shape of the cutting edge of a gouge, such as a '#7-20mm'. Some manufacturers provide charts with the sweeps of their blades shown graphically. In addition to varying blade sweeps, bevels, and widths, blade variations include: * 'Crank-neck' gouges, in which the blade is offset from the handle by a small distance, to allow working flat to a surface * 'Spoon-bent' gouges, in which the blade is curved along its length, to allow working in a hollow not otherwise accessible with a straight bladed gouge * 'Fishtail' gouges, in which the blade is very narrow for most of its length and then broadens out near the working edge, to allow working in tight spaces. All of these specialized gouges allow a craftsperson to cut into areas that may not be possible with a regular, straight-bladed gouge. The cutting shape of a gouge may also be held in an adze, roughly as the shape of a modern-day mattock. Gouges are used in woodworking and arts. For example, a violin luthier uses gouges to carve the violin, a cabinetmaker may use it for running flutes or paring curves, or an artist may produce a piece of art by cutting some bits out of a sheet of linoleum (see also Linocut). Gouges were found at a number of historic Bronze Age hoards found in Great Britain.

Description Some decks, such as the Tarot of Marseilles and Visconti Sforza Tarot omit the name from the card, calling it \\"The Card with No Name\\", thus giving the card a broader and less frightening meaning. There are other decks that title Death as \\"Rebirth\\" or \\"Death-Rebirth.\\" The Death card usually depicts the Grim Reaper, the personification of Death. In some decks, the Grim Reaper is riding a pale horse, but more often he is wielding a sickle or scythe. Surrounding the Grim Reaper are dead and dying people from all classes, including kings, bishops and commoners.

A settler of the area (since as early as 1763‚Äì1769), Derr had purchased several tracts of land from the William Penn family and other neighboring land owners, the largest of which was known as \\"The Prescott\\". Having been on the land for such a long time, Derr had befriended the local Native Americans of the area. His relationship with these indigenous peoples was so well founded that, even as many of the other local settlers' homesteads were routinely sacked by Native Americans, Derr's lands remained free from attacks. Subsequently, in 1784, he worked with Samuel Weiser to lay out his combined land tracts, and create Derrstown. The name was later changed to Lewisburgh when Snyder County was created from Union County in 1855 (according to a local Keystone marker sign), but was known on original plans and deeds as Lewisburg before that time (also see note below). Much has been considered regarding 'how' the name changed from Derrstown to Lewisburg. The most likely truth is that Derr's first name \\"Ludwig\\" translated into English as \\"Louis\\" but, being of German descent, it was spelled \\"Lewis\\". Later, after Derr's death, the traditional Germanic \\"burgh\\" was appended to his first name to create Lewisburgh. Note: U.S. Postal Service records contradict this story. The post office was named Lewisburgh when it was established in 1796; in 1893, the name was shortened to Lewisburg. The street names that run east and west are a local urban mystery. St. George, St. Catherine, and St. Louis etc. appear to be named for saints. While Lutherans, such as Derr was, recognize historic catholic saints, the street names are more likely named for Derr's family members (whose names coincided with saints). Those streets are consecutively parallel, and emanate from what was then Derr's home, and the location of the first available lot sold (which were both situated on, what is now, Mill Street). George was Ludwig's son, his wife Catherine and Ludwig/Lewis (sic) himself. The other original street names that still exist are St. John, St. Mary and St. Anthony, which may be the names of other children from families with whom Derr's own family were friends. However, there is an indication that Derr also had a daughter named Mary. Overall, however, the premise is further supported by the notion that the German word for street is Strasse (Stra√üe, abbreviated St). At the time, street names were pronounced as Strasse Mary or Strasse George. Later, when signs were made to note the street names, the abbreviation for Strasse was allowed to remain, but the US/English abbreviation was redundantly added to the signs. The second mystery surrounding Lewisburg is the disappearance of its founder Ludwig Derr. After selling several lots of land, Derr set off for Philadelphia to sell additional lots. Shortly after arriving, records indicate some of his lots had sold. However, Ludwig Derr simply disappears from history in that city. Derr's son George went to Philadelphia to search for his father, but returned a short time later, unsuccessful. Over the centuries, Lewisburg has been a center of commerce in Union County. The West Branch Susquehanna River was used for logging and shipping, and remains of old factories and other ancient stone structures exist along the river banks. Prior to, and during, the Civil War, many abolitionists lived in the area, and several locations within the town of Lewisburg served as stopping points on the famous Underground Railroad.

History The village of Linnville or Linntown came to be in the second half of the nineteenth century. Named for the Linn family who owned several farms on the south side of the Lewisburg-Mifflinburg turnpike (present-day Route 45), it originally consisted of just a few houses on the north side of the turnpike. Arrival of the railroad stimulated commercial ventures such as the Kulp Lumber Mill and the Lewisburg Chair Factory (1887, forerunner of Pennsylvania House). Linntown saw large population growth when the Linn farms were developed into residential building lots in the 1920s.

In 1792, S. Lulis and Catharina Jungman (Youngman) and their two children, came from Fort Augusta (now Sunbury) Pennsylvania to the Buffalo Valley to settle on land given to them by Catharina's father.

In 1827 the two villages combined and were incorporated. The combined village was named Mifflinburg, in honor of Thomas Mifflin, the first Governor of Pennsylvania after the 1790 Constitution. The merged towns were known as Mifflinburg before 1827 however, because when Union County was formed from Northumberland County on March 22, 1813, that PA legislative act also established Mifflinburg as the seat of government of the newly formed county, with the first courthouse located at 406 Green Street and other government offices located in various other buildings throughout the town. It remained the county seat until 1815 when it was moved to New Berlin, and then to Lewisburg in 1855 where it remains today. In 1845, George Swentzel set up Mifflinburg's first buggy business. Soon other buggy manufacturers set up their own shops in Mifflinburg, and by 1855, with a population of 800, Mifflinburg hosted thirteen coachmakers. By the 1880s, with more than fifty buggy and sleigh factories, Mifflinburg became known as ‚ÄúBuggy Town‚Äù because its buggy makers produced more horse-drawn vehicles per capita than any other town in the state.

History  Franklin sits on French Creek and the Allegheny River, which was a great spot for Native Americans to build shelter. In 1740, Scottish fur trader John Fraser built a trading post in Franklin. Once the trading post was abandoned, British fur traders planned to construct it. George Washington was sent to Franklin to warn the French that they were trespassing on British land. The French did not leave; instead they created Fort Machault, where they amassed large forces to attack Fort Pitt (Pittsburgh) in an effort to reclaim Fort Duquesne. The French then had to rescue Fort Niagara; before leaving they burned Fort Machault to the ground. In 1760, the British erected Fort Venango. In 1763, Native Americans killed many British. The American Colonial Forces then constructed Fort Franklin, named after Benjamin Franklin. In 1787 Andrew Ellicott, who surveyed Washington D.C., was hired to lay out the land of Franklin. Once oil was discovered in nearby Titusville, Franklin became a booming oil town. Once oil companies moved west, Franklin created machinery companies.

It is located at a bend in the Allegheny River at the mouth of Oil Creek. Initial settlement of Oil City was sporadic, and tied to the iron industry. After the first oil wells were drilled in 1861, it became central to the petroleum industry while hosting headquarters for the Pennzoil, Quaker State, and Wolf's Head motor oil companies. Tourism plays a prominent role in the region by promoting oil heritage sites, nature trails, and Victorian architecture. The population was 10,557 at the 2010 census, and it is the principal city of the Oil City, PA Micropolitan Statistical Area. History Fleet of Oil Boats at Oil City, 1864. Ice jam on Oil Creek near Oil City, during mid/late 1970s. The Cornplanter Tract and Oil Creek Furnace In 1796, the state of Pennsylvania gave Cornplanter, chief of the Wolf Band of the Seneca nation, of land along the west bank of the Allegheny River in Warren County, Pennsylvania, as well as a small tract on both sides of the mouth of Oil Creek, in compensation for his services during the American Revolutionary War. The first white settler in what became Oil City was an unknown individual who cleared and farmed about on the west side of Oil Creek upstream from Cornplanter's land. Francis Halyday (or Holliday) purchased this land in 1803, and settled there with his family. The first white child known to be born in what became Oil City was James Halyday, born January 13, 1809. Three or four other families soon settled on the east side of the creek above the \\"Cornplanter Tract\\". Cornplanter sold the eastern half of his tract to two white settlers, William Connely and William Kinnear, in May 1818. Connely sold his quarter of the original tract back to Cornplanter in October 1818, but the land was seized by the county for nonpayment of taxes and sold at auction in November 1819 to Alexander McCalmont. McCalmont sold his land to Mathias Stockberger in the spring of 1824. On June 25, 1824, Kinnear, Stockerberger, and settler Richard Noyes formed William Kinnear & Co., a company which swiftly erected an iron bloomery, foundry, gristmill, and several warehouses. A mill race provided water power for the furnace. Homes were built for workers, and a steamboat landing constructed on the Allegheny River. This settlement was called Oil Creek Furnace. Settler James Young opened the first general store in town, and operated it in the 1850s. The original incorporators were bought out by brothers William and Frederick Crary in January 1825. The company was purchased in February 1835 by William Bell, who changed the corporate name to W. Bell & Son. He and his son, Samuel, operated the furnace until 1849, employing about 40 men. The poor quality of iron ore in the area made their operations unprofitable and the furnace closed in 1849. The settlement was soon deserted, except for two families (the Bannons and the Halydays). Deserted Oil Creek Furnace The bend in the Allegheny River at Oil City slowed the speed of the river's waters, providing a spot for barges and rafts to land easily. For many years, the Bannons and Halydays rented rooms in their homes and space in their barns to bargemen and rafters using the landing at Oil Creek Furnace. About 1852 or 1853, Thomas Moran settled in the area and built a large inn (Moran House) next to the Bannon home. It proved popular and soon expanded, and became a local landmark. Samuel Hopewell opened a second inn shortly after Moran, and in the fall 1852 his brother, John P. Hopewell, opened a third inn and a new general store on Main Street. Settler Hiram Gordon opened the Red Lion, the area's first saloon, about the same time Hopewell's store began operation. Located near the mouth of Oil Creek, the saloon provided live entertainment. In June 1856, of the property was sold by the Bell heirs to Graff, Hasson & Company. James Hasson, son William Hasson, and William's family took up residence on the tract and began farming. Although the village of Oil Creek Furnace was largely deserted, settlement continued in the area. On August 6, 1840, Benjamin Thompson patented nearly all of what is now Oil City east of Oil Creek and north of the Allegheny. This land was quickly subdivided and sold to other settlers. With the death of his mother in 1844, James Halyday sold his land about 1846 to Dr. John Nevins and several other settlers. Nevins was a physician, the first to practice medicine in the area. James Hollis patented of land on the south side of the Allegheny River in 1851, and purchased the remainder of Thompson's land on January 3, 1853. Hollis, in turn, sold all his land on April 25 to Henry Bastian. Laytonia, Cottage Hill, Imperial City, and Leetown Edwin L. Drake drilled the first commercially successful oil well in nearby Titusville on August 27, 1859. Oil was struck on the Downing farm south of the river by Phillips & Vanusdall in April 1861. Oil City had fewer than six families living there in 1859. The discovery of oil changed that. By 1868, a number of boomtowns had emerged in the region, including Oil City, Petroleum Center, Pithole, Rynd Farm, and Titusville. By 1860, the oil trade was far and away the dominant industry in the Oil City area. A machine shop (which constructed pipe fittings), warehouses, and other industrial structures were built on the west side of Oil Creek. Barges were used to transport oil down Oil Creek and into Oil City, where it was transferred to steamboats or bulk barges to continue on to Pittsburgh and other locations. In 1859, Nevins sold his property to the Michigan Rock Oil Company, which built Main Avenue, platted an unnamed town around it, and erected a few buildings. On March 26, 1863, Henry Bastian sold his land to William L. Lay. Lay established a ferry near what is now the foot of Central Avenue. Lay platted a town of 80 lots near his ferry's landing on the south shore, and named the town Laytonia (sometimes referred to as \\"Laytona\\" or \\"Latona\\"). The same year, Charles Haines and Joseph Martin bought out the Hassons (who had continued to farm their land), and graded Grove Avenue. The two built a number of homes along the street, calling their settlement Cottage Hill. The United Petroleum Farms Association purchased part of Cottage Hill as well as an adjoining in 1864. The company subdivided the land into lots and swiftly built homes here. In 1865, Vandergrift, Forman & Company, a petroleum exploration firm, bought the property of a number of settlers around the north landing of Lay's Ferry and established a town the company called Imperial City. West of Laytonia, Charles Lee established a settlement called Leetown. Founding of Oil City In 1862, residents in the area obtained a charter from the state, uniting the area north of the river as a borough named Oil City. South of the river, in particular, growth continued to be haphazard. Streets there often did not match up, hindering transportation. Residents realized that there were too many names in use for this area, which was causing problems. In 1866, the citizens of the borough south of the river petitioned Judge William G. Trunkey to give their borough a common name. He selected Venango City. By 1866, Venango City had a population of more than 1,500, and more than 4,500 people lived in Oil City. Oil City began platting extensive areas of land between 1869 and 1872. This included the upper and lower south side, Palace Hill, upper Cottage Hill and Clark's Summit. A long funicular ascended the high hill. Built in 1872, the Panic of 1873 devastated home sales on Clark's Summit. The funicular company went bankrupt, and the track was removed in 1879. By 1870, residents of Oil City and Venango City desired unification of their joint, growing metropolis. They sought a town charter from the state, which was granted by the legislature on March 3, 1871. Oil City was the name of the unified boroughs. The first Oil City elections were held in April, and the first mayor, William M. Williams, and 12-member city council sworn in on April 11, completing the act of incorporation. Oil City replaced her charter with a new one in January 1881 after the state implemented a new township charter law. A city hall was erected later that year on Seneca Street. Post-charter Oil City The city was partially destroyed by flood in 1865 and by both flood and fire in 1866 and again in 1892; on this last occasion, several oil tanks that were struck by lightning gave way, and Oil Creek carried a mass of burning oil into the city, where some 60 lives were lost and property valued at more than $1 million was destroyed. Oil City grew into a thriving community through the later half of the 19th century and into the 20th century. By the 1990s, Pennzoil, Quaker State, and Wolf's Head had all relocated their headquarters elsewhere. However, some oil wells continue to produce a steady supply of quality petroleum. Regional governments and public organizations promote tourism by thoroughly educating the public about oil history. Oil City's location along the Allegheny River in the foothills of the Appalachian Mountains provides excellent opportunities for exploring Northwestern Pennsylvania. The Oil City Downtown Commercial Historic District, Oil City North Side Historic District, Oil City South Side Historic District, National Transit Building, and Oil City Armory are listed on the National Register of Historic Places. Geography Oil City, Pennsylvania is located at the confluence of the Allegheny River and Oil Creek at . According to the United States Census Bureau, the city has a total area of , of which, is land and (4.65%) is water. Many layers of rock and sedimentary material containing fossils can be seen on the bluffs in and around Oil City. Oil City is framed by the surrounding foothills with the Allegheny River winding through downtown. The Allegheny River and Oil Creek freeze occasionally during the winter, sometimes causing ice jams; although remediation by the U.S. Army Corps of Engineers has reduced ice formation via a floating ice control structure on the river and a fixed concrete weir on the banks of the creek. Flooding of the river flats is a possibility throughout the year due to ice jams, excessive snow melt, large volume storms and hurricane or tropical storm remnants.

Sports  The Oil City Oilers were a Minor League Baseball team located in Oil City, Pennsylvania between 1940 and 1951. The team played in the Pennsylvania State Association from 1940 to 1942, and later moved to the Middle Atlantic League after World War II ended. The team began in 1940 when the Pittsburgh Pirates relocated their affiliate, the McKeesport Little Braves, to Oil City. The team stayed affiliated with the Pirates until 1947, when it began an affiliation with the Chicago White Sox. That year, the team's name was changed to the Oil City Refiners. The team's name was changed one last time to the Oil City A's, when they merged with the Youngstown A's, in 1951. The team the folded, along with the league, at the end of that season. The Oilers name originated from an earlier team that represented the city between 1895 and 1907, in the Iron And Oil League and the Interstate League.

William A. Irvine, M.D., another son of Callender's, settled in Brokenstraw in 1825, and > spent his life attempting to turn the Irvine property to profitable > commercial ventures. Among his many enterprises were a lumbering business, > the general store started by his father, a wool factory, an iron foundry, > and further speculation ... his farm, internal improvements ... the > blacksmith shop ... and the Irvine post office. In the mid-1850s, Irvine was > forced to give up most of his business, retaining the farm, the lumbering > concern, and land on which he later developed oil. His wife was Sarah Duncan Irvine; their daughter was Sarah Irvine Newbold. The mansion and property were known locally as the \\"Irving Estate\\" or \\"Newbold Estate.\\" Esther Newbold, great-granddaughter of Callender, was the last generation of the family to live in the mansion. She \\"had studied law in Philadelphia and was known for keeping up on legislative matters in Harrisburg.\\" Esther died in 1963 at almost 90 years of age, and the home was razed ten years later, in 1973. A model of the house was made for the nearby Clinton E. Wilder Museum.

The system was primarily used by the U.S. Navy to provide accurate location information to its Polaris ballistic missile submarines, and it was also used as a navigation system by the Navy's surface ships, as well as for hydrographic survey and geodetic surveying. Transit provided continuous navigation satellite service from 1964, initially for Polaris submarines and later for civilian use as well.  History  Operational Transit satellite The Transit satellite system, sponsored by the Navy and developed jointly by DARPA and the Johns Hopkins Applied Physics Laboratory, under the leadership of Dr. Richard Kershner at Johns Hopkins, was the first satellite-based geopositioning system. Just days after the Soviet launch of Sputnik 1, the first man-made earth-orbiting satellite on October 4, 1957, two physicists at APL, William Guier and George Weiffenbach, found themselves in discussion about the radio signals that would likely be emanating from the satellite. They were able to determine Sputnik's orbit by analyzing the Doppler shift of its radio signals during a single pass. Discussing the way forward for their research, their director Frank McClure, the chairman of APL's Research Center, suggested in March 1958 that if the satellite's position were known and predictable, the Doppler shift could be used to locate a receiver on Earth, and proposed a satellite system to implement this principle. Development of the Transit system began in 1958, and a prototype satellite, Transit 1A, was launched in September 1959. That satellite failed to reach orbit. A second satellite, Transit 1B, was successfully launched April 13, 1960, by a Thor- Ablestar rocket. The first successful tests of the system were made in 1960, and the system entered Naval service in 1964. The Chance Vought/LTV Scout rocket was selected as the dedicated launch vehicle for the program because it delivered a payload into orbit for the lowest cost per pound. However, the Scout decision imposed two design constraints. First, the weight of the earlier satellites was about each, but the Scout launch capacity to the Transit orbit was about , but this was later increased significantly. A satellite mass reduction had to be achieved, despite a demand for more power than APL had previously designed into a satellite. The second problem concerned the increased vibration that affected the payload during launching because the Scout used solid rocket motors. Thus, electronic equipment that was smaller than before and rugged enough to withstand the increased vibration of launch had to be produced. Meeting the new demands was more difficult than expected, but it was accomplished. The first prototype operational satellite (Transit 5A-1) was launched into a polar orbit by a Scout rocket on 18 December 1962. The satellite verified a new technique for deploying the solar panels and for separating from the rocket, but otherwise it was not successful because of trouble with the power system. Transit 5A-2, launched on 5 April 1963, failed to achieve orbit. Transit 5A-3, with a redesigned power supply, was launched on 15 June 1963. A malfunction of the memory occurred during powered flight that kept it from accepting and storing the navigation message, and the oscillator stability was degraded during launch. Thus, 5A-3 could not be used for navigation. However, this satellite was the first to achieve gravity-gradient stabilization, and its other subsystems performed well. Surveyors used Transit to locate remote benchmarks by averaging dozens of Transit fixes, producing sub-meter accuracy. In fact, the elevation of Mount Everest was corrected in the late 1980s by using a Transit receiver to re- survey a nearby benchmark. Thousands of warships, freighters and private watercraft used Transit from 1967 until 1991. In the 1970s, the Soviet Union started launching their own satellite navigation system Parus (military) / Tsikada (civilian), which is still in use today besides the next generation GLONASS.Encyclopedia Astronautica: Tsikada Some Soviet warships were equipped with Motorola NavSat receivers. The Transit system was made obsolete by the Global Positioning System (GPS), and ceased navigation service in 1996. Improvements in electronics allowed GPS receivers to effectively take several fixes at once, greatly reducing the complexity of deducing a position. GPS uses many more satellites than were used with Transit, allowing the system to be used continuously, while Transit provided a fix only every hour or more. After 1996, the satellites were kept in use for the Navy Ionospheric Monitoring System (NIMS).  Description  thumb Satellites The satellites (known as OSCAR or NOVA satellites) used in the system were placed in low polar orbits, at an altitude of about , with an orbital period of about 106 minutes. A constellation of five satellites was required to provide reasonable global coverage. While the system was operational, at least ten satellites - one spare for each satellite in the basic constellation - were usually kept in orbit. Note that these OSCAR satellites were not the same as the OSCAR series of satellites that were devoted to use by amateur radio operators to use in satellite communications. Transit-1-Satellite Prototype The orbits of the Transit satellites were chosen to cover the entire Earth; they crossed over the poles and were spread out at the equator. Since only one satellite was usually visible at any given time, fixes could be made only when one of the satellites was above the horizon. At the equator this delay between fixes was several hours; at mid-latitudes the delay decreased to an hour or two. For its intended role as an updating system for SLBM launch, Transit sufficed, since submarines took periodic fixes to reset their inertial guidance system, but Transit lacked the ability to provide high-speed, real- time position measurements. With later improvements, the system provided single-pass accuracy of roughly , and also provided time synchronization to roughly 50 microseconds. Transit satellites also broadcast encrypted messages, although this was a secondary function. The Transit satellites used arrays of magnetic-core memory as mass data storage up to 32 kilobytes. Ronald K. Burek. \\"The NEAR Solid-State Data Recorders\\". 1998\\\\. Determining ground location The basic operating principle of Transit is similar to the system used by emergency locator transmitters, except that in the latter case the transmitter is on the ground and the receiver is in orbit. Each Transit system satellite broadcast two UHF carrier signals that provided precise time hacks (every two minutes), plus the satellite's six orbital elements and orbit perturbation variables. The orbit ephemeris and clock corrections were uploaded twice each day to each satellite from one of the four Navy tracking and injection stations. This broadcast information allowed a ground receiver to calculate the location of the satellite at any point in time. Use of two carrier frequencies permitted ground receivers to reduce navigation errors caused by ionospheric refraction. The Transit system also provided the first worldwide timekeeping service, allowing clocks everywhere to be synchronised with 50 microsecond accuracy. The Transit satellite broadcast on 150 and 400 MHz. The two frequencies were used to allow the refraction of the satellite radio signals by the ionosphere to be canceled out, thereby improving location accuracy. The critical information that allowed the receiver to compute location was a unique frequency curve caused by the Doppler effect. The Doppler effect caused an apparent compression of the carrier's wavelength as the satellite approached the receiver, and stretching of wavelengths as the satellite receded. The spacecraft traveled at about 17,000 mph, which could increase or decrease the frequency of the received carrier signal by as much as 10 kHz. This Doppler curve was unique for each location within line-of- sight of the satellite. For instance, the earth's rotation caused the ground receiver to move toward or away from the satellite's orbit, creating a non- symmetric Doppler shift for approach and recession, allowing the receiver to determine whether it was east or west of the satellite's north-south ground track. Calculating the most likely receiver location was not a trivial exercise. The navigation software used the satellite's motion to compute a 'trial' Doppler curve, based on an initial 'trial' location for the receiver. The software would then perform a least squares curve fit for each two-minute section of the Doppler curve, recursively moving the trial position until the trial Doppler curve 'most closely' matched the actual Doppler received from the satellite for all two-minute curve segments. If the receiver was also moving relative to the earth, such as aboard a ship or airplane, this would cause mismatches with the idealized Doppler curves, and degrade position accuracy. However, positional accuracy could usually be computed to within 100 meters for a slow-moving ship, even with reception of just one two-minute Doppler curve. This was the navigation criterion demanded by the U.S. Navy, since American submarines would normally expose their UHF antenna for only 2 minutes to obtain a usable Transit fix. The U.S. submarine version of the Transit system also included a special encrypted, more accurate version of the downloaded satellite's orbital data This enhanced data allowed for considerably enhanced system accuracy [not unlike Selective Availability (SA) under GPS]. Using this enhanced mode, accuracy was typically less than 20 meters, i.e. the accuracy was between that of LORAN C and GPS. Certainly, Transit was the most accurate navigation system of its day. Determining the satellite orbits A network of ground stations, whose locations were accurately known, continually tracked the Transit satellites. They measured the Doppler shift and transferred the data to 5-hole paper tape. This data was sent to the Satellite Control Center at Applied Physics Laboratory in Laurel, Maryland using commercial and military teleprinter networks. The data from the fixed ground stations provided the location information on the Transit satellite orbit. Locating a Transit satellite in earth orbit from a known ground station using the Doppler shift is simply the reverse of using the known location of the satellite in orbit to locate an unknown location on the earth, again using the Doppler shift . A typical ground station occupied a small Quonset hut. The accuracy of the ground station measurements was a function of the ground station master clock accuracy. Initially a quartz oscillator in a temperature controlled oven was used as the master clock. The master clock was checked daily for drift using a VLF receiver tuned to a US Navy VLF station. The VLF signal had the property that the phase of the VLF signal did not change from day to day at noon along the path between the transmitter and the receiver and thus could be used to measure oscillator drift. Later rubidium and cesium beam clocks were used. Ground stations had number names; for example, Station 019 was McMurdo Station, Antarctica. For many years during the 1970s this station was staffed by a graduate student and an undergraduate student, typically in electrical engineering, from the University of Texas at Austin. Other stations were located at New Mexico State University, the University of Texas at Austin, Sicily, Japan, Seychelles Island, Thule Greenland and a number of other locations. The Greenland and Antarctica stations saw every pass of every Transit satellite because of their near pole location for these polar orbiting satellites.

Portable Geoceiver A portable version of the ground station was called a Geoceiver and was used to make field measurements. This receiver, power supply, punched tape unit, and antennas could fit in a number of padded aluminum cases and could be shipped as extra cargo on an airline. Data was taken over a period of time, typically a week, and sent back to the Satellite Control Center for processing. Therefore, unlike GPS, there was not an immediate accurate location of the Geoceiver location. A Geoceiver was permanently located at the South Pole Station and operated by United States Geological Survey personnel. Since it was located on the surface of a moving ice sheet, its data was used to measure the ice sheet movement. Other Geoceivers were taken out in the field in Antarctica during the summer and were used to measure locations, for example the movement of the Ross Ice Shelf.  The AN/UYK-1 (TRW-130) Computer  Orbits of the five Transit Satellites (text in German.) Since no computer small enough to fit through a submarine's hatch existed (in 1958), a new computer was designed, named the AN/UYK-1 (TRW-130). It was built with rounded corners to fit through the hatch and was about five feet tall and sealed to be waterproof. The principal design engineer was then-UCLA-faculty-member Lowell Amdahl, brother of Gene Amdahl. The AN/UYK-1 was built by the Ramo-Wooldridge CorporationAN/UYK-1 Machine Reference Manual at Bitsavers (later TRW) for the Lafayette class SSBNs. It was equipped with 8,192 words of 15-bit core memory plus parity bit, threaded by hand at their Canoga Park factory. Cycle time was about one microsecond. The AN/UYK-1 weighed about . The AN/UYK-1 was a microprogrammed machine with a 15-bit word length that lacked hardware commands to subtract, multiply or divide, but could add, shift, form ones' complement, and test the carry bit. Instructions to perform standard fixed and floating point operations were software subroutines and programs were lists of links and operators to those subroutines. For example, the \\"subtract\\" subroutine had to form the ones' complement of the subtrahend and add it. Multiplication required successive shifting and conditional adding. In the AN/UYK-1 instruction set, the machine- language instructions had two operators that could simultaneously manipulate the arithmetic registers‚Äîfor example, complementing the contents of one register while loading or storing another. It may have been the first computer that implemented a single-cycle indirect addressing ability. During a satellite pass, a GE receiver would receive the orbital parameters and encrypted messages from the satellite, as well as measure the Doppler-shifted frequency at intervals and provide this data to the AN/UYK-1 computer. The computer would also receive from the ship's inertial navigation system (SINS) a reading of latitude and longitude. Using this information the AN/UYK-1 ran the least squares algorithm and provided a location reading in about fifteen minutes.  Other satellites  There were 41 satellites in the Transit series that were assigned the Transit name by NASA. Transit 3B demonstrated uploading programs into the onboard computer's memory whilst in orbit. Transit 4A, launched June 29, 1961, was the first satellite to use a radioactive power source (RTG) (a SNAP-3).David, Leonard \\"50 Years of Nuclear-Powered Spacecraft: It All Started with Satellite Transit 4A\\" (June 29, 2011) Space.com‚Äôs Space Insider Column Retrieved July 30, 2011 Transit 4B (1961) also had a SNAP-3 RTG. Transit 4B was among several satellites which were inadvertently damaged or destroyed in a nuclear explosion, specifically the United States Starfish Prime high-altitude nuclear test on July 9, 1962 and subsequent radiation belt. Transit 5A3 and Transit 5B-1 (1963) each had a SNAP-3 RTG. Transit 5B-2 (1963) had a SNAP-9A RTG. Transit-9 and 5B4 (1964) and Transit-5B7 and 5B6 (1965) each had \\"a nuclear power source\\". The US Air Force also periodically launched short lived satellites equipped with radio beacons of 162 MHz and 324 MHz at much lower orbits to study orbital drag. The Transit ground tracking stations tracked these satellites as well, locating the satellites within their orbits using the same principles. The satellite location data was used to collect orbital drag data, including variations in the upper atmosphere and the Earth's gravitational field.

The population was 9,710 at the 2010 census. It is the county seat of Warren County. It is home to the headquarters of the Allegheny National Forest and the Cornplanter State Forest. It is also the headquarters for the Chief Cornplanter Council, the oldest continuously chartered Boy Scouts of America Council, and the catalog company Blair. Warren is the principal city of the Warren, PA Micropolitan Statistical Area. History Warren was initially inhabited by Native Americans of the Seneca nation. French explorers had longstanding claims to the area which they acted to secure in an unambiguous fashion with a military-Amerindian expedition in 1749 that buried a succession of plaques claiming the territory as France's in response to the formation of the colonial Ohio Companyand the first of these was buried in Warren but ultimately control was transferred to the British after the French and Indian War. After the Revolutionary War, General William Irvine and Andrew Ellicott were sent to the area to lay out a town in 1795. It was named after Major General Joseph Warren. The first permanent structure in Warren, a storehouse built by the Holland Land Company, was completed in 1796. Daniel McQuay of Ireland was the first permanent inhabitant of European descent. Lumber was the main industry from 1810-1840, as the abundance of wood and access to water made it profitable to float lumber down the Allegheny River to Pittsburgh. David Beaty discovered oil in Warren in 1875 while drilling for natural gas in his wife's flower garden. Oil came to dominate the city's economy. Many of the town's large Victorian homes were built with revenue generated by the local oil and timber industries. United Refining In recent years, Warren has struggled through hard economic times and a steady decline in population (after peaking at nearly 15,000 residents in 1940), but the city is attempting to bounce back with the Impact Warren project, a riverfront development project in downtown Warren. The completed project will include new townhouses and senior citizen housing, retail and commercial development, a parking garage, convention center and bus depot. Major employers include Walmart, the United Refining Company (gas supplier for Kwik Fill and Red Apple Food Mart gas stations), Allegheny National Forest, Northwest Savings Bank, Whirley-Drinkworks, Superior Tire and Rubber Corp., Pennsylvania General Energy, Betts Industries, Inc, Blair Corporation, Sheetz, and Interlectric.

Canonsburg was laid out by Colonel John Canon in 1789 and incorporated in 1802. The population was 8,992 at the 2010 census. The town is in a rich coal district, and most of the town's work force once worked in local steel mills or coal mines. Interstate 79 and U.S. Route 19 pass through the town, as does the Pittsburgh and Ohio Central Railroad. A trolley used to operate from Washington, Pennsylvania to Pittsburgh through the borough until 1953. The town is home to Sarris Candies and All-Clad Metalcrafters, makers of cookware and other bonded metals. It is adjacent to the Southpointe office park located in Cecil Township, which has a number of large corporate tenants. Yenko Chevrolet, one of largest and most notorious custom muscle car shops of the late 1960s and early 1970s, was also located in Canonsburg. Canonsburg is home to the Pittsburgh Cougars junior hockey league team. The second-largest Fourth of July parade in the state of Pennsylvania, second only to Philadelphia, is held in Canonsburg. In the weeks leading up to the parade, the town frequently gains media attention for its residents setting up folding chairs along the town's main street to stake claim to prime viewing areas. Additionally, Canonsburg is home to an annual Oktoberfest. In the television series Supernatural, the town is featured in the episode \\"Monster Movie,\\" which is set in the borough during the Oktoberfest celebration. History The exact date of the first settlement near the current site of Canonsburg is unclear. Colonel John Canon, a common miller who also served as justice of the Virginia courts at Fort Dunmore (better known as Fort Pitt, now Pittsburgh), purchased some land from the state of Virginia around Chartiers Creek, sometime before May 1780. The state had claimed what is now southwestern Pennsylvania in a dispute that would not finally be settled until later in the decade. In 1781 Pennsylvania carved Washington County out of Westmoreland County, and the county seat was established at Washington. The notes of the first session of the Washington County Court during that year indicate a call for a road from Canon's mill to Pittsburgh. The road to Pittsburgh, called Pitt Street, remains in part today as an archaic and indirect route to the city. The first surviving plat of the town is from April 15, 1788. Lots were sold around Canon's property, and the emerging town took the name of Canonsburg shortly thereafter. 250px Many of the participants in the Whiskey Rebellion of July 1794 were residents of present-day Washington County, which includes Canonsburg. Some of the insurrectionists are believed to have gathered in the town's Black Horse Tavern. However, records do not indicate whether any Canonsburg residents participated in any of the violent acts which occurred during the rebellion. The town was the site of the first institution of higher learning west of the Allegheny Mountains, Jefferson College. Founded in 1802, it was the eleventh such institution in the United States. The Phi Gamma Delta and Phi Kappa Psi fraternities were both founded at Jefferson College. Phi Gamma Delta, of whom President Calvin Coolidge was a member, was founded in 1848. Phi Kappa Psi, of whom President Woodrow Wilson and over 100 U.S. Congressmen claim membership, was founded in 1852. The school would go on to become Washington & Jefferson College in nearby Washington. For generations, Jefferson College financially supported Canonsburg by accounting for much of its income. However, in 1868, the college was moved to nearby Washington, leaving behind empty college rooming and boarding houses, known as the \\"forts\\". Canonsburg's largest financial draw having left, it would take the introduction of the railroad system to return the city to its former glory. The railroad system, on its way from Mansfield (Carnegie) to Washington (See: Chartiers Branch), was fully operational, as scheduled, on May 18, 1871. The first scheduled train departed from the Washington depot carrying \\"borough authorities, the committee of arrangement and reception, as well as Rankin‚Äôs Cornet Band and a number of‚Ä¶prominent citizens who had been invited to join the excursion.\\" They traveled to Mansfield, where they waited for the special to arrive from Pittsburgh. The special had 12 coaches pulled by two locomotives and was filled with a large number of dignitaries, most especially the mayors of Pittsburgh and Allegheny. The special then made it down the newly laid tracks, passing stations full of spectators to cheer on the train. Canonsburg had a large crowd of supporters, and many people climbed aboard the train to ride along to Washington. There, led by Pittsburgh's Great Western Band, the crowd marched to Town Hall for a round of speeches. The Washington Reporter editor pronounced the day \\"a grand success.\\" In 1911, South Canonsburg was annexed. In 1903 the Washington and Canonsburg Railway Company linked the two towns with a trolley line. The company was bought by the Philadelphia Company in 1906, later becoming part of the Pittsburgh Railway Company, linking through to Pittsburgh as part of their interurban service in 1909. The line closed on August 29, 1953, with the last three trolley cars travelling south through Canonsburg to the Pennsylvania Trolley Museum in 1954 shortly before the track was removed. The Canonsburg Armory, Hawthorne School and Roberts House are listed on the National Register of Historic Places. Uranium mill The Standard Chemical Company operated a radium refining mill from 1911 to 1922 on a plot of land. From 1930 to 1942 the company purified uranium ore. Marie Curie was invited to the United States in 1921 and was given an honorary degree by the University of Pittsburgh, and one gram of radium. From 1942 to 1957, Vitro Manufacturing Company refined uranium and other rare metals from various ores and onsite residues, government-owned uranium ore, process concentrates, and scrap materials. The government bought the uranium ore from Vitro and used it in the Manhattan Project. Waste from incomplete extraction and other metallurgical processes accumulated during the site's long history. About 11,600 tons of mill tailings were moved to railroad property near Blairsville between 1956 and 1957. After the closure of Vitro, the site was used by the U.S. Atomic Energy Commission. The site was then used by the Canonsburg Pottery Company, operated by the George Family, for land and clay. The Canonsburg mill site was designated in the 1978 Uranium Mill Tailings Radiation Control Act as eligible for federal funds for clean up. It was the only uranium mill east of the Mississippi River to receive funds. In a $48 million cleanup project, the mill site and 163 nearby properties in Canonsburg were remediated. Residual radioactivity was consolidated into a covered, clay-lined cell at the Canonsburg mill site, which is fenced and posted. Geography Canonsburg is located at (40.262012, ‚àí80.185030). According to the United States Census Bureau, the borough has a total area of , all land. Canonsburg Lake, a recreational lake, lies directly east of the town.

Fourth of July Parade A view from Pike Street in the Canonsburg Fourth of July parade. The Canonsburg Fourth of July Parade is a parade through Canonsburg celebrating Independence Day. It is the second-largest Fourth of July parade in Pennsylvania, second only to Philadelphia, despite Canonsburg having only 8,992 residents. 50,000 to 60,000 people usually attend.Pittsburgh Post-Gazette \\"Squatters spark controversy in Canonsburg\\" 7/2/2002 The parade starts on Morganza Road and runs down the length of Pike Street, heading westward, for approximately 1.5 miles. The parade begins at 10:00 am on the Fourth of July. Parade members include high school and other marching bands from Washington County and the surrounding areas, local sports teams and cheerleaders of all ages, fire trucks, emergency responders, shriners, unicyclists, jugglers, pipers, polka bands, various church groups, members of the VFW, local politicians, and the mayor of Canonsburg. Some groups throw candy to the children along the parade route, and others pass out water bottles. After the parade, the day's festivities continue with food, concerts, events in Canonsburg Town Park, and family entertainment throughout the day. The day ends with fireworks launched near Canon-McMillan Memorial Stadium. The parade is perhaps regionally most famous for the long-standing tradition of enthusiasts placing chairs, benches, and beach chairs along the parade route to reserve their seats, sometimes a week or more ahead of the parade. This has caused controversy among some residents and business owners, but the tradition continues to this day. The seat saving ritual has attracted the attention of CNN, Jay Leno, and David Letterman.Observer-Reporter 6/30/2009 Black Horse Tavern Black Horse Tavern Black Horse Tavern was founded in 1794, on the road between Budd's Ferry on the Youghiogheny River to McFarlen's Ferry on Monongahela River.

In April 1745 Chartier and the Shawnees abandoned the town when the Pennsylvania provincial council indicted him for treason after he defied Governor Patrick Gordon over the sale of rum to the Shawnees.\\"Hanna on Peter Chartier\\", E.P. Grondine, posted February 14, 2013. The historical character of Chartiers Township has been significantly influenced by its agricultural history, its natural resources such as coal and oil and its location along major transportation routes. In 1774 Colonel James Allison was one of the first settlers on Chartiers Creek. His family was one of the twenty families who came to this area in that year, among whom were the Scotts, McDowells, Parks, Morrisions, Struthers, Norris, and others. At this time, there was navigation on Chartiers Creek. The US Congress declared this creek navigable and in fact some local entrepreneurs used it as a means of shipping flour to New Orleans.Funk, Observer Reporter, 6/29/2003 Chartiers Township is located in Washington County, PA, which was formed during the Revolutionary War period on March 28, 1781 from part of Westmoreland County. It was the first County formed after the signing of the Declaration of Independence. The new County was quite large and contained what would later become Greene, Allegheny and Beaver Counties.Washington County Comprehensive Plan, 2005 On March 23, 1790, Chartiers Township was established by the Washington County Court of Quarter Session from the southern part of Cecil Township with a petition from the inhabitants residing in its boundaries. The bounds of the Township were reduced in 1791 by the establishment of Canton Township and Mt. Pleasant Township in 1808,Franklin Ellis, Austin N. Hungerford, Boyd Crumrine. History of Washington County, Pennsylvania with biographical sketches of many of its pioneers and prominent men. H. L. Everts & Co., Philadelphia, 1882 and by the incorporation of and annexations by Canonsburg and Houston Boroughs. The emergence of the Chartiers Valley Railroad and then the local Interstate Highways mitigated the creek's use for transportation but its significance at the end of the 18th century is demonstrated in the name for the Township. In May 1790, John Canon, the founder of Canonsburg, loaded two boats with forty barrels of flour from his mill and shipped them to New Orleans via Chartiers Creek and the Ohio River. On April 8, 1793, an act was passed by the state legislature declaring \\"Chartiers Creek a public highway for boats and rafts.\\" Alfred Creigh, History of Washington County: From Its First Settlement to the Present Time, with Sketches of All the Townships, Boroughs, and Villages, Etc. A. Creigh, 1870, Pennsylvania State University; p. 219. When coal was discovered in Washington County in the 1880s it was shipped down Chartiers Creek to the Ohio River in times of high water. Coal had also become one of the main products of Chartiers Township for many years. Bituminous coal was first discovered in Washington County on the James Allison tract about 1800. It was mined for a long time for domestic use and for blacksmith purposes at twenty-five (25) cents a bushel. By 1876, twenty (20) or more coal banks could be counted and with the coming of the railroads, mining became a big business.Knestrick, Observer Reporter, 11/23/68 The wealth of coal drew interest in the Township for its solid employment opportunities though the work could be dirty and dangerous. Soon the extraction and transportation of coal become more advanced and the need for workers escalated. Mining was the chief occupation with mines in the Meadow Lands, Richhill, Arden, Midland and Westland areas. Early towns were Arden, Meadow Lands, McGovern, Shingiss, McConnells Mill and Gretna. In 1850, the Township's population was 1,677 persons and by 1900 it was 2,141 persons. In 1834 the Township was divided into seven districts, and in 1836 comfortable school houses were erected in each district. School funding in 1836 was $876.15 but had decreased in 1837 to $696.62. By 1880, there were ten districts with ten teachers and 369 students and in 1908; there were twenty schools and 830 students. Average salary for a teacher was $57.50 (males) and $48.00 (females) in 1908. The Township began building its own high school in the early 1940s. Chartiers and Houston formed a jointure and the Chartiers-Houston School District had its first graduating class in 1956.Herron, Jefferson College Times, \\"Houston High School\\" By 2005 and 2006, Allison Park Elementary and Chartiers Houston Junior/Senior High School had 1188 students. Significant Historical Sites and Events Chartiers Township has been the site of significant historical events over the past three hundred years. The \\"Concord Coaches\\" stage coach line ran through the Meadow Lands on the Pittsburgh and Washington line, whose function was later replaced by Chartiers Valley Railway also located in the Township. The Chartiers Valley Railroad Company was begun in 1830 and was the second railroad project of its size in the United States. The Railroad Company started to build rail lines from Pittsburgh in 1857, to Canonsburg in 1869, finally completed to Washington in 1871. This railroad brought a great change in the valley as coal mines were opened and farmers could ship their produce and milk to Pittsburgh and many other kinds of trade were carried over the new railroad. In 1886, Ewing Pump Station was erected by the Southwest Pennsylvania Oil Company and was located in the Meadow Lands. It pumped about 50,000 barrels of oil per day, to and from different points within a radius of thirty-five miles. The total tankage stored at the station was about 2,409,000 barrels, contained in seventy tanks. On June 23, 1908, two 50,000 barrel oil tanks were struck by lightning. One tank exploded sending thousands of barrels of burning oil floating down Chartiers Creek, killing all vegetation and trees along the stream for a mile. In 1911, the Washington County Fair Association was chartered and the first fair exhibition was held at Arden Downs in the Township. The Hagan Stock farm at Arden was chosen to purchase as the fair's location due to its excellent race track. The farm had been used for training and racing horses, with complete facilities for horse boarding year round. The principal attraction of the fair at that time and for years to follow was this racing track. The fair has expanded over the years drawing thousands to view its agricultural events and exhibits and for traditional fair rides, entertainment, games and local food. Other events are also located at the fairgrounds throughout the year. The Washington County Fair has continued through the century as a growing and flourishing enterprise and continues as a showcase for the region's agricultural enterprises. The Pennsylvania Trolley Museum is also located in the Township, on the former Pittsburgh Railways Company's trolley line to Washington, a line which was abandoned in 1953. This trolley system served as an important link for the south hills of Pittsburgh and Washington County residents who traveled for work, shopping, and recreation. The non-profit Pittsburgh Electric Railway Club (later the Pennsylvania Railway Museum Association) purchased a 2,000-foot section of abandoned railway line from the Pittsburgh Railways Company in 1954. It had been used by the Washington interurban trolley line from Washington to Pittsburgh. The museum is located near the Washington County Fairgrounds in Chartiers Township. On February 7, 1954, the museum's first three cars were moved to the site. The museum was opened to the public in June 1963, providing visitors with short demonstration trolley rides and an informal tour of the car house. Since then, using mostly volunteer help, new cars and facilities including the Visitor Education Center, Museum store and Trolley Display Building have been built and more than thirty (30) cars are on display to the public. A \\"spur\\" off the original section of trolley track has been built across the road to the County Fairgrounds to allow fair visitors to experience a ride a scenic 4-mile ride on a restored trolley. The Pennsylvania Trolley Museum exceptionally preserves the historical significance of this once vital form of transportation through the region. In the early 1950s, a one-room office building with garage was constructed for a township municipal building. In 1993, the Board of Supervisors entered into a building project to renovate the existing Township Building and garages into administrative offices, tax offices and Police Department, plus razing a portion of the Fort Pitt Fixture Building to make room for a new meeting center and parking lot. The remaining section of Fort Pitt's building was steel-sided and houses the Public Works Department. The John White House was listed on the National Register of Historic Places in 1998. Present and Regional Setting Chartiers Township is a 24.53 square mile municipality located in central Washington County, five (5) miles north of the City of Washington and twenty-five (25) miles southwest of the major metropolitan area of Pittsburgh. The Township is bordered on the northwest by Mount Pleasant Township, northeast by Cecil Township, the east by Canonsburg Borough, Houston Borough and North Strabane Township, the southeast by South Strabane Township and the southwest by Canton Township. Along its southeastern border, runs Chartiers Creek separating it from North and South Strabane. Regional access to the Township is provided by Interstate 79 on to Racetrack Road and Pike Street. The Township is governed by a Board of Supervisors, with the assistance of municipal staff and Commissions, such as the Planning Commission and Zoning Hearing Board. The Chartiers-Houston School District services the educational needs of the Township in addition to the residents of Houston Borough. Chartiers Township can be categorized as primarily a residential and agricultural community. Many seek rural parcels in the Township for the keeping of private horses, and farming is still a viable enterprise. There are many post World War II housing developments along with new residential developments making it a 'bedroom community'. Residential development pressures have increased from nearby growth areas such as Peters Township, North and South Strabane and Allegheny County. New residential development in the Township over the past ten years includes Arden Mills, The Ridgeview Plan and The Summit. Despite this, much of Chartiers nearly twenty- five (25) square miles is still rural in nature. Most suburban development in the Township has and will occur on agricultural land and/or on wooded sites. The Meadow Lands is home to most of the commercial establishments. There are a number of light industrial sites between the Washington County Fairgrounds and Chartiers-Houston High School. Throughout the 1970s and 1980s the region suffered with the loss of traditional mining and manufacturing employment base. As some of these mining and industrial enterprises in the Township have closed, new industry has located in the Township such as the DBT National Headquarters. The Arden Landfill is located in the Township and the Department of Environmental Protection has issued a major permit modification to Arden Landfill Inc., authorizing an expansion of the existing municipal landfill in Chartiers Township from 280 acres to 434 acres. Historically, the Township is best known for the two important cultural amenities of the Washington County Fairgrounds and the Pennsylvania Trolley Museum. These two resources and the events held at them should be utilized to promote the Township in the region. Chartiers Township's resources and convenient location in the regional transportation network has attracted increased development pressures. The Township's proximity to the retail development along Route 19/Interstate 79 from Allegheny County and the substantial development of the North and South Strabane corridor with Trinity Point, the Meadows Racetrack and Casino and the Tanger Outlets have had a significant impact on the community. The easy access and proximity of these employment and commercial activities make the Township even more attractive as a place to reside. These centers provide employment, shopping and cultural opportunities while their proximity will continue to place growth and development pressures upon the Township. The availability of land in the area will act as impetus for the attraction of development in the community. The lack of water and sewage service in many areas may be one of the impediments to future growth.

Donora was incorporated in 1901. It got its name from a combination of William Donner and Nora Mellon, banker Andrew W. Mellon's wife. The borough's nickname is \\"The Home of Champions\\", mainly because of the large number of famous athletes who have called Donora their home. Agriculture, coal-mining, steel-making, wire-making, and other industries were conducted in Donora early in its history. In 1910, 8,174 people lived in Donora; in 1920, 14,131; and in 1940, 13,180. According to U.S. census figures, the population was 5,653 in 2000 and 4,781 in 2010. Donora is a Rust Belt location which has lost most of its industrial capacity. It is in the \\"Mon valley\\", downriver from Charleroi and upstream of Braddock. History In 1794, the Whiskey Insurrectionists held several meetings at Fells Church, approximately east of Donora. A trolley line opened in Donora on December 15, 1901, linking First and McKean, and Fifteenth Street and Meldon. It was extended in 1911 to Black Diamond to connect to the Charleroi to Pittsburgh interurban trolley. The line was abandoned on May 5, 1953. The town was the scene of the infamous Donora Smog of 1948. Between October 26 and October 31, 1948, an air inversion trapped industrial effluent (air pollution) from the American Steel and Wire plant and Donora Zinc Works. During this spike in air pollution, 6,000 people suffered respiratory problems and extreme discomfort.John Bachmann, David Calkins, Margo Oge. ‚ÄúCleaning the Air We Breathe: A Half Century of Progress.‚Äù EPA Alumni Association.

It is the oldest settlement in the Monongahela River Valley and most likely the oldest in Washington County. The original tract of land was actually owned by three different men, who named their land areas Eden, Paradise, and Gloucester. Joseph Parkison, who operated a ferry on the west bank of the Monongahela River, is recognized as the founder of Monongahela. Parkison built the town's first post office, and in 1782 the town was officially recognized as Parkison's Ferry. Adam Wickerham took claim to on the Parkison Ferry tract, July 1, 1788.

On April 1, 1837 Williamsport was given the name Monongahela City and in 1893 shortened to Monongahela. The word Monongahela is Native American in origin, meaning \\"falling banks\\". The Monongahela tribe was also indigenous to the area prior to the settlement of the city. The Edward G.

In this year, two new shopping centers, Strabane Square and Trinity Point, were constructed. The shopping centers sit astride Interstates 70 and 79, as well as US Route 19 and State Route 136. The township's location at the juncture of these major arteries, in addition to US Route 40, has played no small part in its rapid commercial development. A third major commercial center, The Foundry, opened in spring 2007. The Foundry has since closed due to land subsidence and all major stores have moved out. A housing boom occurred simultaneously with the commercial development. Washington Woods and Washington Lake, two higher class developments, were recently finished. Villas on the Green, a development of primarily carriage/cluster homes, was also finished along Country Club Road. New housing starts include Cameron Estates, a development of nearly 150 single family units paralleled with another 150 ready made modular duplexes located along Cameron Road. Strabane Manor, a 232 unit townhouse complex, was recently started along Fischer Road. It sits opposite of the Stonecreek development, a developing apartment complex with over 200 units. In addition to these developments, The Preserve at Timber's Edge, a smaller development of houses clustered in the wooded areas along Lakeview Drive, was recently approved for development. In the works include a possible 'empty-nester' aimed development near the Route 19 corridor. Most importantly, the township board of supervisors, in conjunction with the Washington County Redevelopment Authority and the Trinity Area School Board approved the Tax-Incremented Financing (TIF) Plan for Bass Pro Shops and Tanger Outlet Malls. These developments will be larger than all of the township's current developments and will be located alongside of Interstate 79. The developments will be located close to The Meadows Racetrack and Casino in neighboring North Strabane. Development plans include a large Outdoor World store, in addition to other Bass Pro Shops developments. Bass Pro also intends to install sizable outdoor recreational and test facilities for ATVs, boats, and hunting gear. Next to the Bass Pro Shops will be Tanger Outlet Malls, a company nationally known for its development of outlet malls. The outlet center, which is slated to hold over 150 stores, will be similar in composition to the Grove City Outlets, located north of Pittsburgh, but will be slightly larger than that development. Also, a large development, located between US Route 40 and Interstate 70 in an area known as the 'Zediker Corridor', is in the planning stages through Consol Energy, Inc. Consol Energy, a company well known throughout southwestern Pennsylvania, is a large mining company that hopes to develop over with commercial offices. The areas around this development will be heavily developed with residential satellite developments. This development is over two times the size of the nearby SouthPointe, a development of commercial offices with some housing.

History City Hall in Washington, PA George Washington Hotel, South Main Street Delaware Indian chief Tangooqua, commonly known as \\"Catfish\\", had a camp on a branch of Chartiers Creek, in what is now part of the city of Washington.Walkinshaw, Lewis Clark (c. 1939). Annals of southwestern Pennsylvania, Vol. 1. New York. Lewis Historical Publishing Company, Inc, p. 16. The French labeled the area \\"Wissameking\\", meaning \\"catfish place\\", as early as 1757. The area of Washington was settled by many immigrants from Scotland and the north of Ireland along with settlers from eastern and central parts of colonial Virginia. It was first settled by colonists around 1768. The Pennsylvania General Assembly passed an act on March 28, 1781, erecting the County of Washington and naming \\"Catfish Camp\\" as the place for holding the first election. This was the first county in the U.S. to be named in honor of General George Washington. David Hoge laid out a plan of lots immediately after the legislature's action. His original plot carried the name \\"Bassett, alias Dandridge Town,\\" but before the plot was recorded, lines were drawn through \\"Bassett, alias Dandridge Town\\" with ink, and the word \\"Washington\\" was written above. There have long been rumors among locals that the town was named Washington because George Washington spent the night in the region once. This is not true however; Washington had never been to the area. The original plot dedicated a tract of ground to the people for recreational purposes. A lot was given for a courthouse where the current building now stands, and Lots 43 and 102, according to the plan, were presented by Hoge to \\"His Excellency, General Washington, and Mrs. Washington.\\" Washington, Pennsylvania, was the center for the 'Whiskey Rebellion' of 1791, which was one of the first open rebellions against the new U.S. government and Constitution. The rebellion was centered on a tax being imposed on whiskey distillation in the region. The house of David Bradford, one of the leaders of the rebellion, is now a museum devoted to the Whiskey Rebellion, the David Bradford House, located on South Main Street of the city. The town was incorporated as a borough on February 13, 1810, and became a city of the third class in 1924.City of Washington home page In August 1875, construction began of the Waynesburg and Washington Railroad, conceived by John Day in 1874 and chartered in 1875. Passenger services ended in 1929, conversion to standard gauge followed in 1944, when it was renamed the Waynesburg Secondary. Freight services ended in 1976, although part of the line still survives for access to a coal mine. The discovery of oil and natural gas among the Washington oil field caused a boom period from the 1880s to the early 1900s. James B. Wilson chartered the Washington Electric Street Railways in 1889 with construction beginning in November 1890. The first line was built from the Waynesburg and Washington Narrow Gauge station to Wilson Orchard, just north of the present day site of the Washington Hospital. In 1903 the Washington and Canonsburg Railway Company linked Washington to Canonsburg, Pennsylvania with a trolley line. The company was bought by the Philadelphia Company in 1906, later becoming part of the Pittsburgh Railway Company, linking through to Pittsburgh as part of their interurban service in 1909. The line closed on August 29, 1953. A short section of the line and a number of trolley cars are preserved at the Pennsylvania Trolley Museum north of the city. According to a walking tour brochure researched and written by two Washington & Jefferson College professors in 2012, fifteen American presidents have visited Washington before, during, or after their presidential terms: James Monroe (1817); Andrew Jackson (several stops 1820s and 1830s); John Quincy Adams (1843); Ulysses S. Grant (several stops 1860s and 1870s); William Henry Harrison; James K. Polk; Zachary Taylor; Benjamin Harrison (1876, 1892); William Howard Taft (1916); Warren G. Harding (1922); Franklin D.

The borough's population was 4,480 at the time of the 2010 census. Honesdale is located northeast of Scranton in a rural area that provides many recreational opportunities, such as boating, fishing, hiking, hunting, skiing, biking, skateboarding, and rafting. Located in a coal mining region, during the nineteenth century it was the starting point of the Delaware and Hudson Canal, which provided for transport of coal to Kingston, New York, and then down the Hudson River to New York City. In the 19th century, the expansion of railroads eventually superseded regular use of the canal. History 1890 panoramic map of Honesdale The discovery of anthracite coal in northeastern Pennsylvania in the early 1800s and the need to transport this valuable fuel to New York City gave birth to the Delaware and Hudson Canal, the American Railroad, and the Borough of Honesdale. Honesdale was named for Philip Hone, former Mayor of New York and president of Honesdale's Delaware & Hudson (D&H;) Canal Company. Honesdale, originally called \\"Dyberry Forks,\\" was laid out as a village in 1826 when the D & H Canal was created. It was incorporated as a borough on January 28, 1831. The Honesdale Residential Historic District and the D&H; Canal are listed on the National Register of Historic Places. Birthplace of American railroading Honesdale is home to the first commercial steam locomotive run on rails in the United States, the Stourbridge Lion. On August 8, 1829, the Stourbridge Lion started in Honesdale, ran three miles to Seelyville, and returned; Honesdale, therefore, is known as the birthplace of the American Railroad. The Stourbridge Lion, owned by the Delaware & Hudson (D&H;) Canal Company was regrettably considered too heavy for further use. D&H; transported anthracite coal from mines near Carbondale to New York City via Honesdale and Kingston, New York. Coal was moved by a unique gravity-railroad from the mines to Honesdale where it was transferred to barges and transported via a 108-mile canal to Kingston, New York, then shipped by river barges down the Hudson River to New York City. What remained of the Stourbridge Lion passed into many hands over the coming years and was eventually acquired by the Smithsonian Institution in 1890. The main boiler is currently on loan at the Baltimore and Ohio Railroad Museum in Baltimore, Maryland. The Wayne County Historical Society Museum contains a full-scale replica of the Stourbridge Lion; the Society also displays many historical photographs, artifacts and other exhibits. The D&H; Railroad Company built the replica using original blueprints for the 1933 Century of Progress Exposition in Chicago. The replica was relocated to Honesdale in 1941. Passenger excursions run seasonally from Honesdale to Hawley along the historic Stourbridge Line. The railroad runs twenty-five miles along the Lackawaxen River. Excursions depart from the platform at the Wayne County Visitors Center. Geography Honesdale is located at (41.574214, -75.255966). According to the United States Census Bureau, the borough has a total area of , of which is land and (2.5%) is water of the Lackawaxen River, which flows through the heart of the town, and its confluence with Dyberry Creek. The waters contain fish and other aquatic life and attract hundreds of ducks, as well as eagles and other raptors. 800 Block of Main Street, Honesdale Demographics As of the census of 2010, there were 4,480 people, 2,086 households, and 1,147 families residing in the borough.

The population was 8,002 at the 2000 census. It is the northernmost municipality of Westmoreland County. The municipality borders the townships of Buffalo, Harrison, Upper Burrell, and Washington; and the boroughs of Oklahoma, Vandergrift, Leechburg, West Leechburg, Lower Burrell, Freeport and Hyde Park. It is served by the Kiski Area School District. History Although there are many who believe Allegheny Township was formed in 1796, it appears, according to available records, that the Township was actually formed from Washington Township in 1820. At its formation, Allegheny Township included what is now Lower Burrell, Hyde Park, Vandergrift, West Leechburg, Arnold and New Kensington. There had been an earlier Allegheny Township formed by the Westmoreland County Court of Quarter Sessions in December 1795, north of the Kiskiminetas River in what is now known as Armstrong County. The area was a hunting ground for Seneca, and later, Delaware Indians. The Allegheny Township Community Building, which is the municipality's government center, was constructed in 1976 and completed the following year at the intersection of the PA Route 356 by-pass and Junior High School Road, after state and federal funds became available from legislators to finance the project. The project happened in conjunction with the completion of the 356 bypass that same year. The building consisted of a large double door auditorium with a separation curtain to divide the room in half if needed, a zoning office, supervisor's office, tax office, municipal authority office, conference room, storage room, a kitchen and a police station. Prior to the building's completion, the township conducted business from a rented basement office at Kiski Park Plaza shopping center on Route 56 at the intersection of the 356 by-pass. A new police station was built on the Community Building grounds in 2006. Louise Majocha became the township's first woman supervisor in 1983. She was appointed to fill the unexpired term of Milton L. Rimmel, 46, who died July 2 of that year due to a heart attack. Majocha was appointed by the two surviving board members, Fred Hoculock and Ron Sheetz prior to the end of July. However, she chose not to run for election in November, and left office in January 1984, being succeeded by Dennis Francart. In 1983, the Township increased its full-time police force from two to three officers, in addition to putting a third patrol car on the road. Ralphaela J. Stoner became the township's first woman elected as supervisor in the late 80's. Governing Body and Executive Protocol Allegheny Township is governed by an elected body under the second class Township Code of the state of Pennsylvania. The Board is called the Board of Supervisors and consists of three (3) elected officials each serving a six-year term. The Board of Supervisors is responsible, as a governmental unit, to strive to improve the health, safety, and welfare of the residents of Allegheny Township. In order to accomplish that task the Board adopts laws, known as ordinances, that governs various activities within the Township. The Board appoints a Township Manager who is charged by the Board to implement the ordinances it passes, and to manage the annual budget of the Township which is adopted by the Board in December for the following calendar year. The Board of Supervisors meets on a monthly basis (Wednesday after the first Monday and the second Monday) at 7:00 p.m. in the Community Building, to conduct business on behalf of the Township. All meetings of the Board are open to the public with an opportunity at each meeting for public comment. If a resident has a concern he or she feels needs to be addressed by the Township, the individual is encouraged to contact the Township Manager's Office which may be able to address the manner promptly and/or schedule an appropriate time for that individual to present concerns to the Board of Supervisors. Residents are encouraged to present their views on Township matters at this time.

The population was 5,157 at the 2010 Census. History Present-day Westmoreland County was part of the hunting reserves of the Iroquois Indians. White colonists began to penetrate the area in the 1750s, and circa 1781 Robert McCrea purchased the land on which Arnold is situated. William Jack acquired the property and later passed it on to Wilson Jack. The area around Arnold was first settled in 1852 by Major Andrew Arnold, who grew up in Kittanning. With the creation of Westmoreland County in 1773, the area that became Arnold was originally part of Burrell, and later Lower Burrell, townships. Arnold was then part of the newly-created city of New Kensington from 1891 until it was separately incorporated as a borough in January 1896, and as a third-class city in 1939. Arnold is governed under Pennsylvania's third-class city code, with a mayor, treasurer, controller, and four council members elected at-large. Past mayors of Arnold have been M. Frank Horne (1939-1960), Alfred Colaianni (1960-1963), Willie DeMao (1963-2004), John Campbell (2004‚Äì2012), and Larry Milito (2012-2016). Karen Peconi-Biriccochi, a Democrat, took office in 2016. In 2018, during protests over the shooting of an unarmed African American teen by a white police officer in East Pittsburgh, Peconi authored a social media post that urged law enforcement to \\"bring the hoses\\" against the protesters. Calls for her resignation resulted in city council formally requesting the state legislature to remove her from office.https://www.cnn.com/2018/06/28/us/pittsburgh-suburb- mayor-water-cannons-protesters-trnd/index.html On May 21, 2019 Peconi- Biriccochi was defeated by Councilman Joseph Bia II in the Democratic primary, effectively ending her bid for re-election in the heavily Democratic city. Bia was subsequently elected to a full term as mayor in November 2019 and took office in 2020. Geography Arnold is located on the eastern shore of the Allegheny River, northeast of Pittsburgh.

History The old rail depot Bolivar Public School - 1904. Reese Hammond Fire Brick Co, Plant No.2 Bolivar, PA 1907 The United Presbyterian Church from a pre-1923 postcard The first settlers arrived in Bolivar about the year 1829 and settled between Tubmill Creek and the Conemaugh River. Most of the men were employed by the Pennsylvania Canal. The canal was located on the south side of the Conemaugh River. Some of the locks still may be seen west of town. Several small brickyards were started in the area, producing a red brick. Some of the houses on Second Street were constructed of these brick. They are still well- preserved today after exposure to the elements for over a century. The Pennsylvania Railroad replaced the canal in 1846. Brickyards No. 1, and No. 2, and No. 3 were constructed between the Conemaugh River and the railroad. Bolivar was beginning to grow and prosper and was known as a \\"Brick Town\\". In 1863 Bolivar withdrew from Fairfield Township and became a borough, under the grounds that it was designed like many other boroughs of the time, in a checkerboard pattern. Bolivar borough was incorporated November 25, 1863. The north side of the Conemaugh was a very desirable location for new construction of brickyards due to the completion of the Western Pennsylvania Railroad from Blairsville to Bolivar, and the close proximity to coal and clay. No. 4 Brickyard at the time of its first operation was the largest brickyard in the North American continent, having a capacity of 100,000 paving blocks each day. The Robinson Brothers also constructed a brickyard, and it is the only one in existence at the present time, being known as Garfield Refractories Co. The Enamel Works started in 1899 with a large government contract. The Bolivar School was constructed of brick made from the Enamel Works. J. B. Hammond got control of the five brickyards in Bolivar and several in Clearfield County just before the start of the 20th century, and a rapid expansion took place. This might be called \\"The Golden Era of Bolivar.\\" A large hotel was started near the station and a large department store was planned for Washington and Second Streets. Pipes were laid under the streets for central heating, but the dream was never realized. A panic took place in 1902, the bank failed (the depositors were paid in full later) and the brickyards were forced into receivership. From 1914 through the 1920s, Bolivar enjoyed its second boom period. Soissons and General Refractories took over the brickyards and the Lacolle Mine and Ridgeview Coal Mines were opened, and shipped large quantities of coal. Mining, lumbering and manufacturing employed many persons. The Lincoln Brickyard enjoyed a brief period of prosperity under the leadership of Lorenzo Mumford. He was a leader, designer of bricks, and salesman, and kept the yard going for many months. He sold a million bricks to the Chase National Bank in New York for construction of one of its banks. Bolivar was hit hard by the Great Depression of the 1930s. The following losses during the depression and the years ensuing have not been replaced in many instances. Bolivar has lost six brickyards, two large coal companies, restaurants, flour and feed mill, railroad station, express station, two banks, lumber yard, opera house, movie house, dentist office, The Bolivar News, Cornet Band, swimming pool, bakery, jewelry store, furniture store. The Antiochian Village was established in 1978. The Ligonier Meeting of American bishops took place there in 1994.

The community was divided into the two separate communities of Calumet and Norvelt for the 2010 census. Although the US Census treats Calumet and Norvelt as a single community, they are in reality two very different communities, each reflecting a different chapter in how the Great Depression affected rural Pennsylvanians. Calumet was a typical ‚Äúpatch town,‚Äù built by a single company to house its miners as cheaply as possible. The closing of the Calumet mine during the Great Depression caused enormous hardship in an era when unemployment compensation and welfare payments were nonexistent. On the other hand, Norvelt was created during the depression by the US federal government as a model community, intended to increase the standard of living of laid-off coal miners. Geography Calumet-Norvelt is an unincorporated community within Mount Pleasant Township. Calumet-Norvelt is located at (40.213730, -79.493121). According to the United States Census Bureau, the CDP has a total area of , all of it land. History of Calumet Calumet was founded by the Calumet Coke Company in 1888 as a housing site for its workers. The community, as originally laid out, consisted of twenty double-houses, twelve single-family houses, and a few commercial and industrial buildings. The workers were employed in a coal mine and also tended ovens that produced coke (fuel). In 1894, Calumet was the site of a bitter coal miners‚Äô strike against the H. C. Frick Coke Company, which at that time was part-owner of Calumet Coke Company. The coke works closed in the 1920s, and the mine closed in the early 1930s during the Great Depression, causing enormous hardship for the community's workers. History of Norvelt Norvelt, originally named Westmoreland Homesteads, was created April 13, 1934, as one of a series of ‚Äúsubsistence homesteads‚Äù under the National Industrial Recovery Act. These communities were intended to allow rural inhabitants to have an improved quality of living, while largely growing their own food. It was hoped that these new communities would raise the standard of living for unemployed coal miners from nearby Calumet and similar \\"patch towns\\" in the area. Accordingly, each lot was a minimum of , and other land was set aside as a cooperative farm. The community's layout and home designs were created by Paul Bartholomew, an architect who had also designed many notable buildings in Greensburg. In 1937, the community's name was changed to Norvelt (EleaNOR RooseVELT), following a visit by Eleanor Roosevelt, wife of President Franklin D. Roosevelt.

The population was 2,686 at the 2010 census. History Delmont was initially known as New Salem. The 300 acres of land was warranted to William Wilson in 1784 and upon his arrival in 1785 he named the area New Salem. In 1812 a post office was established in New Salem and it was named Salem X Roads(Salem Crossroads), Pennsylvania. Hugh Bigham was the first postmaster. Wilson continued to farm on the land until his death in 1796. After Wilson's death in 1796 his estate was divided between his sons, Thomas and George. It was not until 1812 that the patent was validated. Eventually, the family conveyed their deeds over to Thomas and he became the sole owner of the property. Thomas decided to divide the property into 48 lots to form a crossroads village. Thomas Wilson designed the town around a watering trough that was built in 1810 by Hugh Bigham. The watering trough was originally known as the \\"running pump.\\" The watering trough was connected with wooden pipes to a \\"Big Spring\\" that's never known to run dry. In 1814, two days before Christmas, 48 lots were auctioned off to form a \\"crossroads\\" town. As the area developed, the town was referred to locally as \\"Salem Crossroads.\\" On April 8, 1833, the town was incorporated as \\"New Salem Borough.\\" The mailing address was Salem Crossroads until 1871, when town postmaster Zachariah Zimmerman changed it to Delmont. The town and the post office carried two different names until May 16, 1967, when residents voted to change the borough's name to Delmont after a promotional campaign by then-Mayor Franklin Mangery. Several areas in and around the borough still carry the Salem reference. Major navigational roads were built through the area in the late 18th century, and what is now local Route 66 was built in 1800. The East-West Northern Turnpike was completed in 1819 linking Philadelphia to Pittsburgh. Delmont was a busy stagecoach stop boasting at one time five stage coach lines through the village. Travelers would stop tired and hungry and patronized the several inns and taverns in town. In 1853, the Pennsylvania Railroad was complete through Westmoreland County to Pittsburgh. This was a faster more economical way to travel. In 1855,the last stagecoach passed through the crossroads village and ended the stagecoach era for the crossroads town. The now defunct Salem Crossroads Historical Restoration Society worked to maintain the local history and to restore the area. As a result of their efforts, the Salem Crossroads Historic District was listed on the National Register of Historic Places in 1978. In 1980 the society purchased Shields Farm, which hosts the annual Apple 'N Arts festival on Shields farm during the first week of October.

Roads Aside from the historical genesis of the town as a toll intersection and stagecoach stop, one of Delmont's notable characteristics is that it is the meeting point of two major highways, U.S. Route 22 and State Route 66. For many years, these roads did not directly intersect but were linked by a cloverleaf interchange. Delmont became known for this interchange; many local merchants incorporated \\"Cloverleaf\\" into their business names as a result. In 2000, the \\"cloverleaf\\" system was dismantled and a single-point urban interchange was built in its place.https://www.pahighways.com/toll/PATurnpike66.html This change was made to accommodate the widening of Route 22, one of the most heavily traveled roads in Pennsylvania. The interchange on Route 22 marks the boundary between suburban Pittsburgh and the more rural foothills of the Appalachian Mountains.

Derry is a borough in Westmoreland County in the Commonwealth of Pennsylvania, east of Pittsburgh. The Borough of Derry, consisting of the town area, should not be confused with Derry Township, which is a separate municipality surrounding the borough. The population was 2,688 at the 2010 census. History Derry, originally known as Derry Station, was created in 1852 to serve the Pennsylvania Railroad. It was named after the village on PA Route 982 originally known as Derry and now known as New Derry (even though it is older than the community being discussed here). The original \\"Derry\\" in Westmoreland County, Pennsylvania was named after the city Derry in Northern Ireland, because the area‚Äôs first non-Indian inhabitants were Scotch-Irish. Derry was ideally suited for major railroad facilities because of its ready access to water from McGee Run (essential in the era of steam locomotives) and because it sits atop a slight summit along the railroad right-of-way. In Derry's heyday in the late 1800s, it had four hotels, mainly to serve railroad workers, as well as a roundhouse for locomotive maintenance and a massive railroad yard. Derry was incorporated as a borough on October 22, 1881. Also, Derry served as the terminal for Pittsburgh commuter trains until 1964, when the Pennsylvania Railroad ceased operating its commuter service. The annual Railroad Days Festival serves to remind residents of Derry's railroading heritage. Derry downtown business district Bird's-eye view of Derry Station in 1900 Little remains of Derry's railroading boom, although some might notice an unused railroad right-of-way that extends from Derry westward to PA Route 981, running slightly north but parallel to the currently-used railroad tracks. This was an ill-fated project known as the Derry-Donohoe-Jeannette (DDJ) bypass, in which the Pennsylvania Railroad attempted to build a new main line that would avoid the curves and slopes of the existing main line, bypassing Latrobe and Greensburg. Construction of the bypass began in the 1920s, including a large trestle near Bradenville, but the new route was never completed. Derry and Latrobe were also linked by the Westmoreland County Railway Company which was an interurban (long-distance trolley) operating from 1904 to 1932. A helicopter crash into a crowd assembled for a festival at St. Joseph's Catholic Church in Derry killed eight people and injured 18 others on Labor Day, 1978. The railroad crossing in downtown Derry has also been the site of other fatal accidents. Crest Heraldry of the Crest The center of the crest is adorned with St. George‚Äôs Cross. St. George was a martyr, one of the most famous in Christendom, and is noted for refusing many bribes and offerings to renounce his faith. He also gave all of his possessions and holdings to the poor. The heart, in the upper left corner of the cross, is sectioned with a bar rising up that signifies love for God. The lower part of the shield is draped with noble ermine as a backdrop for the two charges that respectfully represent community values and Derry‚Äôs rich railroad heritage. The railroad theme is carried on at the top of the design with a crest emblazoned with the borough‚Äôs name and establishment date. The decorative foliage around the design is tinted blue for loyalty and gold for generosity. The tincture also represents the local school‚Äôs colors and the borough‚Äôs commitment to youth and education. Finally, the lower banner motto resonates the strong foundation of community reserved for the families that call the borough home as well as an acknowledgment to the great country that the borough resides in. Overall, the crest portraits a very noble ideal of community, heritage, charity and endless love for God in the face of danger. Geography Derry is located at (40.333037, -79.301011).

After hearing of the land being settled by soldiers from Forbes' army, John Pomroy, a man of Scots-Irish descent, left his home in Cumberland valley and settled in Derry township, near present day New Derry. Later, James Wilson came and settled near by and they helped one another build and farm. One winter, a few years after settling in Derry township, Pomroy and Wilson returned to their homes in the East. When they returned, each brought with him a wife. Pomroy married Isabel Barr. Later, her father and two of her brothers, along with William Guthrie and Richard Wallace and others migrated to Derry township. To protect the citizens of Derry township from Indian attacks, Fort Barr and Fort Wallace were built in 1774. Other dangers that early settlers faced included bears, panthers, and foxes.

The city lies within the Laurel Highlands and the ecoregion of the Western Allegheny Plateau. The city is named after Nathanael Greene, a major general of the Continental Army in the American Revolutionary War. The population was 14,892 at the 2010 census. Located 30 miles southeast of Pittsburgh, Greensburg is a major business, academic, tourism and cultural center in Western Pennsylvania. It is evident as the city's population doubles during work hours. The city ranks seventh in Pennsylvania in daytime growth, behind Pittsburgh, Philadelphia, Harrisburg, King of Prussia, Lancaster, and State College. It also ranks 16th in the United States for daytime growth among towns with a resident population between 15,000 and 24,999. In 2007, Greensburg was ranked as one of the \\"Best Places to Retire\\" in Pennsylvania by U.S. News & World Report.  History : Note: some unsourced statements in this section appear in the History section of the City of Greensburg's official website After the end of the Revolutionary War, an inn was built along a wagon trail that stretched from Philadelphia west over the Appalachian Mountains to Fort Pitt, now the city of Pittsburgh. A tiny settlement known as Newtown grew around the inn, today the center of Greensburg's Business District at the intersection of Pittsburgh and Main Streets. At Pittsburgh, the wagon trail became Penn Avenue. Newtown became the Westmoreland County seat in 1785, after the original county seat, Hannastown, was damaged during a raid by Seneca people and Canadian rangers. On December 10, 1785 county officials entered into an agreement with Christopher Truby and William Jack to purchase two acres of land in Newtown on which to erect public buildings. The first courthouse and jail were a single building, built of logs and heavy plank. The jail portion had a heavy stone wall which extended some distance above the ground, \\"perhaps to keep prisoners from cutting their way out.\\" Court was first held in this structure on January 7, 1787. The Westmoreland County Courthouse, in its various incarnations, has stood on this site ever since. The area surrounding the courthouse became Greensburg (\\"Greenesburgh\\", as some documents referred to it at the time). It was named for American Revolutionary War General Nathanael Greene. Greensburg was formally incorporated as a borough on February 9, 1799, making it the first borough in the county. In the early 19th century, Greensburg had very little growth in population (see population data table in this article). After 1850, Greensburg became a growing county seat with inns and small businesses. It was a railroad stop and the discovery of large areas of soft coal nearby made it the center of a vigorous mining industry in the late 19th century and early 20th century. Seton Hill College, formerly St. Joseph's Academy, became a four-year women's institution in 1918. Greensburg became a City of the Third Class on January 2, 1928. After World War II, more residential areas were developed in various sections of town. Greensburg's cultural status grew as the Westmoreland County Museum of Art opened in 1959 and the University of Pittsburgh founded the branch campus, University of Pittsburgh at Greensburg, in 1963, now located in Hempfield Township. The opening of Greengate Mall and Westmoreland Mall in 1965 and 1977, respectively, marked a new era for retail shopping in the area, but negatively impacted retail businesses in Downtown Greensburg's shopping district. Changes in local shopping habits had already taken its toll by the late 1970s when Troutman's Department Store closed. By the mid-1990s, city officials shifted its revitalization plans on the cultural aspects of Downtown Greensburg, such as the restorations of the Palace Theater and the historic Train Station, as well as a new, recently opened performing arts center for Seton Hill University. Also, in July 2009, Lake Erie College of Osteopathic Medicine, the largest medical school in the country, opened a satellite campus at Seton Hill University. Now over 200 students study at LECOM at Seton Hill every year. As part of this ongoing transition, an expansion of the Westmoreland Museum of American Art was completed in 2015. Westmoreland County Courthouse The city is home of the Roman Catholic Diocese of Greensburg.  Historical facts  *Greensburg's first log school house was located at the site of St. Clair Park. *St. Clair Park was originally a cemetery. When the borough banned cemeteries, St. Clair cemetery was moved to its current location, just east of town. *Mid Town Plaza was also originally a cemetery. Most, but not all, of the graves were moved to other area cemeteries upon its redevelopment. *Mt. Odin Park was originally the estate of Dr. Frank Cowan, attorney, physician, author and former Secretary to President Andrew Johnson. Dr. Cowan willed his land to Greensburg to be used for recreational purposes.  Neighborhoods and wards  The city of Greensburg is currently composed of eight wards, most of which were formerly boroughs and are divided into several neighborhoods. Bunker Hill, now Fifth Ward, was merged into Greensburg in 1894. The name originated because of fights at the rowdy Bushfield Tavern in the early 1840s to mid-19th century that were compared to the Battle of Bunker Hill. In 1905, Greensburg absorbed three adjacent boroughs, including Ludwick, now Sixth Ward, which was named for Ludwick Otterman, an early settler for whom the street is also named, as well as East Greensburg, now Seventh Ward, and Southeast Greensburg, unofficially known as Paradise (Eighth Ward). South Maple Avenue was originally named Kinderhook (Third Ward). Second Ward, located north of Downtown Greensburg, is the largest ward and includes the neighborhoods of Saybrook Village, Evergreen Hill, New Salem Acres, Country Club Meadows, Northmont, Devonshire Heights, Rose Fountain Farms and Academy Hill. Hilltop, a neighborhood in Eighth Ward, was originally settled by Italian immigrants and borders South Greensburg and Underwood on either side. First Ward features Chestnut Hill and Shuey Plan, and is also home to Seton Hill University. Other Greensburg neighborhoods include Eastern Estates, Underwood, Shogan and Hillcrest. Eighth Ward was originally home to many Italian immigrants from Cercemaggiore, Italy. Today, the original Our Lady of Grace church, built by the masons from Italy, still stands although used as a residence. The Hilltop Social Club, founded by a few families who lived in the areas of Bierer, Margaret, White and Catherine Streets is also located here. Every year it has become a tradition for the firehall in the Eighth Ward to throw a carnival which includes bingo, amusement rides, and of course the famous Shuey Burgers. Two neighborhoods have been designated as U.S. historic districts, the Greensburg Downtown Historic District and the Academy Hill Historic District. Also listed on the National Register of Historic Places are the Greensburg Railroad Station and Westmoreland County Courthouse.

City Hall, formerly headquarters of West Penn Railways  Government and politics  Greensburg is an incorporated city governed by Democratic mayor Robert L. Bell and a four-member City Council. The mayor and the City Council members serve four-year terms. The seat of government is the Greensburg City Hall. The small size of Greensburg has not deterred it from being a player on the political scene. Greensburg has hosted its share of prominent politicians over the years, including a July 1994 visit from then-President Bill Clinton, former Democratic candidate John Kerry and his running mate John Edwards in July 2004 and Democratic candidates Hillary Clinton and Barack Obama in March 2008. It was also, according to local historians, the site of the 1854 National Republican Party convention ‚Äì the first convention of the Grand Old Republican Party, despite Pittsburgh's claims.  Military  Greensburg is home to the 14th Quartermaster Detachment, a United States Army Reserve unit. During the Gulf War, the unit took the heaviest casualties of any Coalition unit during the war when an Iraqi missile hit a US Army barracks in Dhahran, Saudi Arabia, on February 25 1991. The 69-member unit suffered a casualty rate of 81%, including 13 killed. Greensburg's community was heavily affected by these losses and a memorial to the 14th's personnel was constructed at the city's US Army Reserve Center. There is also a National Guard Armory just outside the main City.  Economy  The former Troutman's Department Store on South Main Street South Pennsylvania Avenue Ghost sign, South Pennsylvania Avenue Originally a railroad stop on the Pennsylvania Railroad, Greensburg quickly became the center of the coal mining industry in the region by the late 19th century when large areas of soft coal were discovered nearby. This contributed to the growth and development of the growing county seat. Many businesses and inns flourished within Downtown Greensburg for many years, and once boasted four major department stores ‚Äì JCPenney, Royers, Sears and its largest department store, Troutman's. In August 1965, Greengate Mall opened west of the city in Hempfield Township. Greengate was part of the first wave of indoor shopping malls in the country. The mall's opening marked a new era for retail shopping in the area, but it negatively impacted stand-alone businesses in Greensburg's downtown corridor. By the late 1970s, several local stores, including Troutman's, the city's major department store, closed. The downtown area eventually rebounded as the city became a center for service industries, professional offices and banking. Today, small downtown shops and a growing number of restaurants are reviving downtown as a mercantile center. Westmoreland Mall is currently the largest shopping complex in the Greensburg area and all of Westmoreland County. Greengate Mall suffered losses in the 1990s when anchor store JCPenney relocated to Westmoreland Mall. As the mall continued on its irreversible decline, the nationally based Montgomery Ward and the regional chain Horne's also closed. The building was eventually razed in 2003, and a new shopping center called Greengate Centre, anchored by a Walmart, was subsequently built. Numerous shopping plazas and dining establishments also line the Route 30 corridor east and west of the city. With over of retail space and growing, Greensburg is considered the commercial center of the Laurel Highlands region of Pennsylvania as well as one of the largest retail markets in Western Pennsylvania. Light to moderate industry and service industries thrive in the Greater Greensburg area. Several industrial parks are primarily located outside the city limits. In addition, the area is home to two large prisons, the Westmoreland County Prison and the State Correctional Institution at Greensburg, both in Hempfield Township. Housing growth continues on the northern end of the city, with the Saybrook Village and Evergreen Hill plans. The opening of the seven-story State Office Building on North Main Street, the completion of the four-story addition to the Courthouse Square Extension, and the Performing Arts Center of Seton Hill University are expected to add new jobs to the city and attract more visitors.  Major employers  Two major corporations are headquartered in the Greensburg area: Excela Health and the Tribune-Review.  Education = Public schools  University of Pittsburgh at Greensburg The Greater Greensburg area contains two public school districts. The larger of the two is the Hempfield Area School District. The school district has a resident population of over 50,000 and spans approximately ninety-five square miles and lies thirty miles southeast of Pittsburgh. Comprising Hempfield Township, and the communities of Adamsburg, Armbrust, Bovard, Grapeville, Hannastown, Hunker, Luxor, Manor, New Stanton, and Youngwood, the school district completely surrounds the city of Greensburg. Hempfield is also the largest school district in Westmoreland County with approximately 7,000 enrolled students and is one of the largest in Western Pennsylvania. The second school district servicing Greensburg itself is the Greensburg Salem School District. The school district covers an area of fifty-one square miles. With an enrollment of 3,600 students, Greensburg Salem serves the City of Greensburg, South Greensburg, Southwest Greensburg and Salem Township. Detailed information including enrollment figures and test scores about Greensburg Salem can be found on this website.  Private schools  Greensburg is home to Greensburg Central Catholic High School and Aquinas Academy (www.aquinasacademy.org), both private Catholic schools.  Colleges and universities  The immediate vicinity of Greensburg contains two universities ‚Äì Seton Hill University and the University of Pittsburgh at Greensburg. Seton Hill University was founded in 1885 by the Sisters of Charity on a bluff overlooking the City of Greensburg. Formerly a women's college, Seton Hill became a coeducational university in 2002. In recent years, Seton Hill has begun to expand into the downtown area with the construction of several academic buildings and a performing arts center. The Greensburg campus of the University of Pittsburgh was founded in 1963 in Downtown Greensburg, and would later grow into a large campus in nearby Hempfield Township. It was voted \\"Best University in the Region\\" for eight straight years (1999‚Äì2007) by the Tribune-Review. In addition, the branches of Carlow University, Lake Erie College of Osteopathic Medicine and Triangle Tech are located within the Greater Greensburg area. The campuses of Saint Vincent College and Westmoreland County Community College are also located in the nearby communities of Latrobe and Youngwood, respectively.  Libraries  The Greensburg Hempfield Area Library serves the City of Greensburg and Hempfield Township.  Arts and culture  YMCA Greensburg is a major cultural center in Western Pennsylvania. It is the home of the Westmoreland Museum of American Art, which specializes in American Art circa 1750‚Äì1950. The Palace Theatre, in the heart of the city's emerging cultural district, is the site for various performances throughout the year. Additionally, it is the home of the Westmoreland Symphony Orchestra, and the Summer Sounds Concert Series at the Robertshaw Amphitheater in St. Clair Park. The Westmoreland Cultural Trust has played a major role in the revitalization of Downtown Greensburg in recent years. Its accomplishments include the ongoing renovation of the Palace Theatre and the restoration (Before/After Pictures) of the circa 1910 Train Station. They are also responsible for renovating several commercial buildings in the downtown area. Stage Right! also contributes to the culture of the region, offering classes in musical theatre for young people and staging professional productions at the Palace Theater and Greensburg Garden and Civic Center. Greensburg Civic Theatre, one of the few long-established volunteer- based community theatre organizations in Westmoreland County, has been presenting both adult and children's theater productions for over 60 years. Founded in 1951, they are the resident theatre company at the Greensburg Garden and Civic Center. The Performance Arts Center of Seton Hill University opened its doors to the public in September 2009. This multimillion-dollar complex, located in the city's Cultural District, is expected to serve as an additional catalyst for the future growth of the downtown core. A hands-on science center, to feature a wide range of interactive exhibits, was proposed for the former Mellon Bank building downtown, but it has since been put on hold indefinitely. Titled the Discovery & Interactive Science Center (DISC), it was to be a regional attraction for Westmoreland, Fayette, Indiana, Somerset and Bedford counties. It would've also been the only interactive science center between the Carnegie Science Center in Pittsburgh and the Harsco Science Center in Harrisburg.

Originally a sister station to 620 WKHB when 620 was WHJB. The 107.1 frequency has had various call signs and formats over a number of years. Originally under the ownership of Mel Goldberg, the station was WHJB-FM briefly in the mid 1960s then becoming WOKU for many years until it became WSSZ (Z107) in the early 1980s with a Top 40 format and then briefly WPNT in the mid 1980s for less than a year before reverting back to WSSZ which would become a classic hits format by the early 1990s that ended abruptly when Mel Goldberg sold the station to Sheradan Broadcasting out of Pittsburgh which began a simulcast of the urban contemporary format of 106.7 WAMO, which also included another call sign change to WJJJ in 2004 that would last until 2006 when the station sold to Renda Broadcasting and was reintroduced locally as WGSM (Sam FM). The station finally adopted the call sign WHJB circa 2010. *To a much lesser degree, the translator 98.7 W254CR which rebroadcasts the programming of 910 WXJX-AM Apollo, Armstrong County, also provides radio service with an adult hits music format known as \\"Jack FM\\" which was launched on December 31, 2018. *Greensburg's major newspaper is the Tribune-Review, which is owned by the Tribune Review Publishing Company.

Professional sports =American football Greensburg Athletic Association: 1894 From 1890 until 1900, Greensburg was the home of the Greensburg Athletic Association, one of the earliest professional football teams. The team began as an amateur football club in 1890 and was composed primarily of locals before several paid players were added for 1895. In 1894 it was discovered that the team had secretly paid formerly Indiana Normal (now Indiana University of Pennsylvania) player, Lawson Fiscus, to play football and retained his services on salary. The team was the chief rival of another early professional football team, the Latrobe Athletic Association. On December 3, 1898, two players from the Greensburg Athletic Association joined with the Latrobe Athletic Association to form the very first professional football all-star team for a game against the Duquesne Country and Athletic Club, to be played at Pittsburgh's Exposition Park. Duquesne went on to win the game 16‚Äì0. Aside from Fiscus, the Greensburg Athletic Association included several of the era's top players, such as: Charlie Atherton, George Barclay, Ross Fiscus, Jack Gass, Arthur McFarland, Charles Rinehart, Isaac Seneca and Adam Martin Wyant. Several of these players revolutionized the game during their playing careers. Charlie Atherton is credited with inventing the place kick, and George Barclay invented the first-ever football helmet. Meanwhile, Isaac Seneca became the first Native-American to earn All-American honors and Adam Wyant made history by becoming the first professional football player to be elected to the United States Congress.

The Bushy Run Battlefield marks the spot where Colonel Henry Boquet led the British and American troops to defeat the Indians in a battle on the 5th and 6 August that year. This victory is credited with helping to prevent the capture of Fort Pitt, and it served the purpose of reopening communication and supply lines. Today, this historical landmark is the site of a museum, nature trails, picnic areas, and an annual reenactment of the Battle of Bushy Run. McKee Glass Factory, late 1880s First incorporated as a borough on June 7, 1889,\\"Jeannette hopes to reclaim glory of manufacturing heyday\\" , Tribune Review, January 28, 2007 Jeannette earned the nickname as \\"the glass city\\" in recognition of the numerous glass plants founded in the area, with those factories contributing to the city's original stature as the first large manufacturing town in Westmoreland County. In fact, the impact of the glass industry was so significant that the city's name actually comes from Jeannette E. Hartupee McKee, the wife of H. Sellers McKee, a local industrialist who cofounded the Chambers and McKee Glass Works and was a member of the elite South Fork Fishing and Hunting Club of Johnstown Flood fame. Mckee and his partner J.A. Chambers also have the distinction of naming Jeannette's main street, Clay Avenue after their financial backer, Richard W. Clay. On January 1, 1938, Jeannette became a third class city with Attorney John M. OConnell as the first mayor.Great Towns in Westmoreland, \\"Jeannette A Great Town in Westmoreland County\\" At times, there were as many as 7 significant factories operating in the city of Jeannette including some of the most well known in the history of the glass industry. Names like Jeannette Glass; Fort Pitt Glass; the Pittsburgh Lamp, Brass and Glass Company; American-Saint Gobain, Westmoreland Glass; and others all supplied the country with everything from plate glass windows, to bottles, to milk glass, and much more for many decades. Some estimates over the years indicate that Jeannette once produced somewhere between 70-85% of the world's glass. Unfortunately, Jeannette's glass industry was one of the early United States industry victims of cheap, foreign competition that made it less expensive to produce glass overseas and today only two glass factories remain in the city. Jeannette's manufacturing history doesn't end with the glass industry. Today's Elliott Company represents an evolution dating back to 1914 when William Swan Elliott moved his company to Jeannette. The Elliott Company, owned by the Carrier Corporation from 1957 until 1979 and by United Technologies Corporation until a 1987 buyout that returned the company to a privately owned status, only to become an Ebara Corporation subsidiary in 2000, has always had a solid reputation in the dynamo, turbine, and large rotating equipment industry. In 1952, the company produced the first diesel-engine turbocharger used in a racecar and subsequently built more than 40,000 more of them for other diesel applications. Throughout the 1970s, local residents routinely witnessed a revolving door of trains hauling parts into the plant on North 4th Street and hauling the huge turbine engines back down the tracks.A History of Accomplishments, Elliott Company Website Today, the Elliott Company is the city's largest employer. Jeannette is also the manufacturing home of Jensen Steam Engine Mfg. Co., Inc., which produces small working models of steam engines and turbines. The Jensen shop is only a few blocks from the Elliott plant. In 2018, the Elliott Company was approved to purchase the former Jeannette Glass site and expand their operations to downtown Jeannette.\\"Pennsylvania‚Äôs ‚Äòglass city‚Äô finds footing in battle against Rust Belt hardships\\" Diana DiGangi The facility could become operational by 2020.\\"Westmoreland: Big projects, big changes on the horizon\\", Signorini, Renatta The Pennsylvania Rubber Works, which moved to Jeannette from Erie, Pennsylvania, around 1903, was yet another key part of the city's significant industrial base. Not only did this factory become a significant supplier of play balls (basketballs, footballs, tennis balls, etc.) and carpet underlay as part of General Tire in its later years; but the original Pennsylvania Rubber Works provided products for Jeeps and gas masks during World War II.

The population was 1,573 at the 2010 census. Ligonier was settled in the 1760s. The borough is well known for nearby Idlewild Park, one of the oldest amusement parks in the country; and nearby Seven Springs Mountain Resort. Another tourist attraction is Fort Ligonier Days, a parade and craft market that takes place every fall over the course of three days, and the Ligonier Country Market in the summer months. Ligonier is part of the Pittsburgh Metropolitan Statistical Area. Ligonier is the site of a reconstruction of Fort Ligonier, an example of a frontier fort of the French and Indian War. Ligonier is also known for its downtown square, the Diamond, which has a bandstand in the middle. History In 1758, when British forces launched a major campaign to remove French forces from the forks of the Ohio, now Pittsburgh, this spot on Loyalhanna Creek was the site of their westernmost camp before reaching the Ohio. The British maintained a large army, a virtual moving city of 6,000 people, that temporarily made this the most populated spot in Pennsylvania, second only to Philadelphia. The fort was named Fort Ligonier after John Ligonier, a British noble of French origin who held the rank of Field Marshal in the British Army. Eventually, the name of the settlement that grew up around the fort was shortened to Ligonier. In 1817, the Philadelphia-Pittsburgh Turnpike was completed, a gravel road that was the precursor to today's US Route 30. Fort Ligonier was a logical place for travelers to break their journey, and with such commercial opportunities in mind, a local resident named John Ramsay (sometimes spelled Ramsey) laid out the street plan, including the space now known as the Diamond. He initially called the town Ramseytown, later changed to Wellington (after the Duke of Wellington), and finally the name was changed to Ligonier. Several decades of prosperity followed. On April 10, 1834, Ligonier was incorporated as a borough. However, in 1852 the Pennsylvania Railroad was completed, which bypassed Ligonier and passed through the towns of Bolivar and Latrobe instead. Traffic shifted from horse-drawn vehicles to the railroad, causing the community's population to drop to 350 according to the 1860 census. Ligonier enjoyed a new impetus when the Ligonier Valley Railroad was completed in 1877, linking the community to Latrobe where connections to the Pennsylvania Railroad were possible. The Ligonier Valley Railroad enabled lumber, coal, and quarried stone to be transported out of the Ligonier Valley, which spurred development of the town. Also, the railroad made it easier for Pittsburgh residents to visit Ligonier, causing the town to develop as a summer resort. Some major physical changes to Ligonier occurred during this period. In 1894, the Diamond, which had been used as a corral for horses and wagons, was transformed into a park with a bandstand. A large hotel, the Hotel Breniser, was built in 1900 where the town hall currently sits. In 1909-1910, the Ligonier Valley Railroad built an ornate station and headquarters building, which still stands at 339 West Main Street. In 1952, the Ligonier Valley Railroad ceased operation, due to a combination of overlogging, decline of the coal industry, and the loss of passenger traffic to motor vehicles. The Pittsburgh, Westmoreland and Somerset Railroad also served Ligonier from 1899 to 1916, although it did not enjoy the success of the Ligonier Valley Railroad. Ligonier has three listings on the National Register of Historic Places: the Fort Ligonier site at 216 South Market Street; the Ligonier Historic District, which encompasses the Diamond and the oldest parts of the borough; and the demolished Ligonier Armory. Ligonier and its surrounding countryside are strongly associated with the Mellon banking family, which still owns considerable tracts of land in the area. The Huntland Downs estate, near Ligonier, comprises some of land and is the centerpiece of the Mellon land holdings in the region.

Located approximately 18 miles northeast of downtown Pittsburgh, it is part of the Pittsburgh metropolitan area. The population was 11,761 at the 2010 census. The population of Lower Burrell was 11,078 in 2019.  History  The region in which Lower Burrell is located was originally part of the hunting reserves of the Iroquois. Permanent European settlement began in the 1760s, and Westmoreland County was created in 1773. In 1852, due to an increase in population in the area, Burrell Township was carved out of Allegheny Township on court order of Judge Jeremiah Murry Burrell. In 1879 Burrell Township was divided into two separate townships, Lower Burrell and Upper Burrell. The present-day cities of New Kensington and Arnold were once part of Lower Burrell Township. In the years that followed, Lower Burrell transformed from a quiet, rural farm community to a residential and commercial area while Upper Burrell stayed primarily rural. Upper Burrell Township is still somewhat rural, though it has experienced some suburban growth in recent years due to many employment opportunities nearby. In 1959, in the midst of the growth of their community, township residents voted to make Lower Burrell a third class city. Lower Burrell continued to grow substantially until the 1980s. Like many communities in Western Pennsylvania, Lower Burrell suffered economic and population stagnation with the collapse of local heavy industry. Since the early 1990s, Lower Burrell experienced slight growth, though one of its only large shopping centers remains mostly vacant. Preliminary data from the 2010 census shows that Lower Burrell has lost about 5 percent of its population since 2000. The Allegheny River Lock and Dam No. 4 was listed on the National Register of Historic Places in 2000. Geography Lower Burrell is located at (40.583966, -79.721948). According to the United States Census Bureau, the city has a total area of , of which, of it is land and of it (2.28%) is water. Informally, the city is divided into different neighborhoods and areas including Bon Air, Braeburn, Braeburn Heights, Central City, Edgecliff, Gladeview, Indian Fields I & II and Kinloch. Lower Burrell's central Business District overlaps Bon Air-Central City-Gladeview neighborhoods. Lower Burrell is located in the Appalachian Plateau, the western portion of the Appalachian Mountain range. The landscape varies greatly, with large swaths of flat land (typically in Bon Air, Central City and Gladeview) to areas with gentle slopes, and even steep cliffs and hillsides in certain areas.

The population was 7,720 at the 2010 census. In 1940, 20,257 people lived there. In 1990 the population was 13,026. Monessen is the most southwestern municipality of Westmoreland County. Steel-making was a prominent industry in Monessen, which was a Rust Belt borough in the \\"Mon Valley\\" of southwestern Pennsylvania that became a third-class city in 1921. Monessen is part of the Pittsburgh metropolitan area, the Rivers of Steel National Heritage Area, as well as the Laurel Highlands. History Monessen, named for the Monongahela River and the industrial German city of Essen, was created by land speculators fairly late in the history of the Mon Valley, after neighboring towns had already been settled. The East Side Land Company bought land from various farmers, laid out the streets, and then sold the lots to prospective residents and employers. James M. Schoonmaker, who had made his fortune in coke, owned a controlling interest in the land company. Other investors in the land company who were also immortalized in street names include Philander C. Knox, James H. Reed, H. Sellers McKee, George O. Morgan, and George B. Motheral. In May 1897, National Tin Plate Company, founded by William Donner, began building its mill, thus becoming Monessen's first employer. Sales of lots began on July 27, 1897, for the general public and other employers. Monessen became a borough on September 3, 1898. Monessen experienced rapid growth in the first two decades of the twentieth century, the population increasing from 2,197 in 1900 to 11,775 in 1910 and then to 18,179 in 1920. While there were many companies operating in Monessen, the largest employer was Pittsburgh Steel Company, later renamed Wheeling-Pittsburgh Steel. In a practice that is shocking by today's standards (and not limited to Monessen), pay was determined by ethnic background. For example, a Welsh immigrant would be paid more than an Italian immigrant. A normal workweek was 84 hours (7 days times 12 hours). Employers did not adopt the eight-hour workday until the 1920s. Monessen's status changed from ‚Äúborough‚Äù to ‚Äúcity‚Äù on September 16, 1921. Beginning in the middle to late 1960s, the region's manufacturers, especially the steel industry, found it harder to compete, which led to employee layoffs. In 1972, the closure of Page Steel and Wire Company was a major setback to the city. A far greater blow to Monessen occurred when its largest employer, Wheeling- Pittsburgh Steel, closed nearly all its Monessen operations in 1986. The company's rail mill did not close until March 1987. The mill's closure marked the end of an era in Monessen's history. View of Monessen from the north Monessen is currently trying to revitalize itself. The city has made efforts for several years to clean up abandoned properties in hopes of revitalizing the city. In January 2010 the first female mayor, Mary Jo Smith, was sworn in at the Monessen Municipal Building. In 2013, Mayor Lou Mavrakis revealed the city has at least $8 million in long-term debt which requires the city to budget $400,000 a year of its $4 million budget to payments on its debt. The old Charleroi-Monessen Bridge Older residents know the steel mills will not be returning to the area. Younger residents barely remember the mills or are even unaware of the city's industrial past. \\"I remember when they tore the blast furnaces down\\" in the mid-1990s, said one resident. \\"It was a big deal. My dad took me. I was 5.\\" The Charleroi-Monessen Bridge was built in 1906 and demolished in 2011. It was listed on the National Register of Historic Places in 1988 and has yet to be removed from the register. Founders Immortalized in some of the city's streets are the names of the founders of Monessen. These men were capitalists, politicians, and land speculators who felt that the prospect of a new community along the Monongahela River was viable. *William Donner *James Martinus Schoonmaker *H.

Other products included flour, lumber, iron, glass, foundry products, etc. History The year of Mount Pleasant's first non-Indian resident is not known, although one source states that at the time of the American Revolutionary War, there was a settlement of \\"not more than a half dozen houses.\\" Braddock Road (Braddock expedition) passed through the western end of the future town in 1755, opening the area to settlement. In 1793 Michael Smith was licensed to operate an inn, which would have served traffic on Glades Road (sometimes spelled Glade Road), now Route 31. In 1797, Nathaniel Marshall sold land to Andrew McCready, who laid out the design of the town. Jacob's Creek Bridge, the first iron-chain suspension bridge built in the United States, was erected south of the town in 1801. It was demolished in 1833. Unfortunately, no pre-1800 structures remain within the borough limits. The borough's three oldest existing buildings all date from approximately 1812: The Shupe House at 201 Main Street, Hitchman House at 355 Main Street, and the Rupert Building at 642-644 Main Street. Mount Pleasant became a borough on February 7, 1828. Glass manufacturing was a foundation of the local economy, with Bryce Brothers commencing operations in 1850, and L. E. Smith GlassL. E. Smith Glass in 1907. The invention of the Bessemer process of steelmaking in 1859, which required coke (fuel), had a dramatic impact on the region. The town prospered as coal deposits were developed, from which coke was made. However, the lives of coal miners in the outlying \\"patch towns\\" (company-owned mining towns) were arduous, and labor-management disputes became frequent. The strike in Morewood, west of Mount Pleasant borough, was the most violent of the area's strikes, in which nine miners were killed by sheriff's deputies on April 3, 1891. Miners at American Radiator Mine, Mount Pleasant, 1936 Warden House (1886) National Register of Historic Places Mount Pleasant was disadvantaged when the main lines of the railroads bypassed the community in the 1850s. The community's isolation lessened in 1871 with the opening of the Mount Pleasant and Broadford Railroad, later part of the Baltimore and Ohio Railroad. In addition, a branch line of the Pennsylvania Railroad connected the borough to Scottdale, and West Penn Railways (an interurban trolley) served Mount Pleasant from 1906 to 1952. The Borough of Mount Pleasant has three listings on the National Register of Historic Places: the Samuel Warden House (1886) at 200 South Church Street, the demolished Mount Pleasant Armory, and the Mount Pleasant Historic District, which encompasses the oldest parts of the borough.

For some time, it remained the largest commercial gas well in the world. Murrysville was described in the first half of the 20th century as being \\"the center of a district dotted with gas wells, the first of which was bored in 1878; wild speculation in leases precipitated the open conflict known as the 'Haymaker Riots,' named for the speculator killed in one of them.\\" Since 1933, Murrysville has had a \\"tree sign\\" spelling out the word \\"Murrysville\\". The trees were landscaped to grow and form the letters by local Boy Scouts. The sign is situated on a large hill as one enters the Municipality from the Murrysville‚ÄìMonroeville border, near U.S. Route 22. In 1947, the sign was featured in \\"Ripley's Believe It Or Not\\" as the world's largest arboreal sign. (It is no longer the world's largest, or even the largest in the country; \\"Luecke\\", near San Antonio, Texas, is much larger.) The \\"Y\\" in the Murrysville sign points to the Haymaker Gas Well. In 1977, Murrysville was designated the \\"Gateway to Westmoreland County\\" by Mayor Walt Dollman in conjunction with the Chamber of Commerce. In 2012, community leaders upgraded sign and landscaping elaborately at the main entrance at the Allegheny / Westmoreland border featuring this designation.

The population was 13,116 at the 2010 Census. History Like much of Westmoreland County and surrounding areas, the region was a hunting ground for Native Americans of the Six Nations European-American settlement began in the mid-1700s. Continental army troops built Fort Crawford, near the mouth of Pucketa Creek, in 1777. The fort was abandoned in 1793. Originally part of Burrell (and later Lower Burrell) Township, the city of New Kensington was founded in 1891. In 1890, the Burrell Improvement Company considered the advantages of the level land south of its home in Lower Burrell, and deemed it a prime location for a city and named the area \\"Kensington\\"; this was later changed to \\"New Kensington\\" for postal reasons, to avoid confusion with the Philadelphia neighborhood of the same name. In an attempt to make New Kensington comparable to Pittsburgh, the streets were named with numbers. Avenues ran parallel to the river, while streets were perpendicular. The main commercial streets were 4th and 5th avenues. Once the land was surveyed, a public sale was held on June 10, 1891. Thousands of people flooded the area and investors began bringing industry with them. The first large company was the Pittsburgh Reduction Company, which later became Alcoa. They acquired a property that allowed the company to utilize the riverfront. The Alcoa facility remained operational until 1971. New Kensington in 1896, seen in a lithograph by Thaddeus Mortimer Fowler Eventually, other companies such as Adams Drilling, Goldsmith and Lowerburg, New Kensington Milling, New Kensington Brewing, Logan Lumber, Keystone Dairy, and many more were built late in the 19th century and continuing into the early 20th century. Early achievements included a railroad station, the 9th Street bridge, a passenger boat that navigated the Allegheny River, a street car line that ran to Natrona via the West Penn Railways, the Kensington Dispatch newspaper, a fire department, hotel, opera house, and a local chapter of the YMCA. New Kensington annexed the independent borough of Parnassus in 1939. Aluminum City Terrace, Building 22 In 1941, New Kensington became the site of a modern workers' housing project‚Äînamed the Aluminum City Terrace‚Äîdesigned by Marcel Breuer and Walter Gropius, which set new standards for federal housing design. Breuer and Gropius ascribed to the famous Bauhaus School of Design in Germany. Intended for Alcoa defense workers, it was subsequently used to rehouse displaced residents from other parts of the city. In 1948, tenants from the Terrace decided to purchase the housing project from the U.S. government to form a co-op, managed by a Board of Directors, elected by representatives from the 250 units. Relatively low-cost monthly fees continue to cover the costs of running the Terrace. Today, New Kensington contains the neighborhoods of Parnassus, Mount Vernon, Valley Heights, Valley Camp, Pine Manor, and 40 Acres. The New Kensington Downtown Historic District, New Kensington Production Works Historic District, and Mount St. Peter Roman Catholic Church are listed on the National Register of Historic Places.

There are over thirty churches representing several denominations throughout the city. Two radio stations, WMNY and WBZZ, are both licensed to New Kensington, and serve the Pittsburgh radio media market. Since the 1970s, the city's downtown has been plagued by high vacancy rates. Starting in 2008, the New Kensington Redevelopment Authority moved to condemn and demolish abandoned commercial and residential properties. The city has also instituted a Weed and Seed urban renewal program, and provided tax abatement to businesses located or opened in designated Keystone Opportunity Zones. Education The city is served by the New Kensington‚ÄìArnold School District, with facilities at Valley High School, Valley Middle School, H. D.

The population was 30,609 at the 2010 census. History Named after England's Earl of Huntingdon, Huntingdon Township was founded on April 6, 1772 in Pennsylvania. Huntingdon's boundaries started at the mouth of Brush Run where it emptied into Brush Creek. The area is approximately 26 square miles (67 km2)with the Township maintaining about 125 miles (200 km)of roads. If these roads were placed end-to-end, they would stretch from North Huntingdon to Cleveland, Ohio.A. L. Historian, Irwin and the World Around It (Irwin, PA: Key Art, 1989), 9. The boundaries, following along Byerly's Path to Braddock Road, continued to the lines that mark Mount Pleasant, Tyrone and Pitt Townships. Huntingdon Township was later divided into the townships North Huntingdon, East Huntingdon, South Huntingdon and Sewickley. Around this same time, Westmoreland County, where North Huntingdon is located, became the townships of Fairfield, Donegal, Mount Pleasant, Hempfield, Pitt, Tyrone, Springhill, Menallen, Rostraver and Armstrong. Many Native American tribes inhabited this area before the European settlers. The Alligewe Indians are believed to be the first people to live in this area.Irwin and the World Around It, 9 After this tribe, there were also the Shawnee, Seneca, Cornplanter and Delaware, also known as Lenni Lenape, tribes. The first white man did not come along until 1662. Arnold Viele, a Dutch trader from Albany, New York was the first white man to enter this territory.10 Score: North Huntingdon Township (Norwin PA, 1973), 16. Viele had wanted to establish Indian trading posts that were closer to other communities. In doing this, he persuaded the Shawnee tribe to move near the Potomac and Susquehanna Rivers. After Viele, James Letort, Andrew Montour, Conrad Weiser and George Croghan were some of the other settlers to move to North Huntingdon. Many different European groups settled in this area. Two of them were the German and Scottish-Irish immigrants. In the late 1670s, North Huntingdon Township was settled from both the eastern and western ends.10 Score: North Huntingdon Township, 22 This section is divided but what is now known as Irwin. The Germans settled in the east and to the west was the Scottish-Irish settlement. In the German settlement, the Lutheran church ran the schools, and they exclusively taught the German language. The Scottish-Irish settlement was Presbyterian. This group settled mostly in the areas of Circleville, Cavitt's Mills and Robbin's Station. The settlers wanted to provide their children with some education in their new homes. Farmers donated land so they could have schools for their children that weren't far from home. The schools were made with logs and a clapboard roof. Established in 1782, Birch Spring School was the first school in the township.The Diamond: Official Publication Commemorating Irwin's 75th Anniversary Celebration (Irwin, PA: Rodgers Printing, 1939), 27. It was also called Master Jack's school after its first teacher. Teachers did not have to meet many requirements to get the job.The Diamond: Official Publication Commemorating Irwin's 75th Anniversary Celebration, 27. They had to pass an exam and have a basic knowledge of reading, writing and math. They also had to know how to mend quill pens and wield birch rods. Another school named Fairview was built in 1816. This school was used in the eastern end of the township, while Master Jack's school was used in the western end. Today, Norwin Middle School is located in the area. Schools were not the only thing that these settlers built. They also made their homes. The homes were about 10 feet (3m) high with only one room and one window. They had to use mud for insulation against the cold winters. Chairs were made of logs and beds were stuffed with hay or straw. There was a hole in the roof, instead of a chimney, to let cooking smoke out of the house. About a century after the German and Scottish-Irish settlers, the Township's population was recorded as 3,000 in 1860.Irwin and the World Around It, 9. According to a census taken in 1980, North Huntingdon Township was the second largest municipality in Westmoreland County with 31,517 residents.

The name of the township has been traced back to Rostrevor, a seaside community in County Down, now in Northern Ireland. It is known that some of the early settlers, such as the McClains, came from County Down so it is surmised that they probably named their new community out of affection for the native village and spelled it phonetically as RostraverDuff, William Boyd.

Early in the 20th century, Scottdale was the center of the Frick coke interests. It had steel and iron pipe mills, brass and silver works, a casket factory, a large milk-pasteurizing plant, and machine shops; all of the aforementioned are presently defunct. Scottdale is notable for its economic decline from a formerly prosperous coke-town into an archetypal Rust Belt town. Duraloy Technologies, \\"a supplier of specialty high alloy, centrifugal and static cast components and assemblies\\" is the last remnant of Scottdale's steel related prosperity. In 1900, 4,261 people lived in Scottdale; in 1910, the population increased to 5,456; and in 1940, 6,493 people lived in Scottdale. The population was 4,384 at the 2010 census. Scottdale is located in the Southmoreland School District. History It is difficult to identify when the first non-Indian settler arrived in what is now the Borough of Scottdale, although the area witnessed an influx of Scotch- Irish immigrants in the late 1770s. In the mid-19th century, part of the present-day townsite was the location of a distillery, flour mill and post office known as Fountain Mills. The Pennsylvania Railroad and Baltimore and Ohio Railroad each built branch lines through the community in the early 1870s. With the coming of the railroads, the community‚Äôs economy shifted from agriculture to manufacturing and mining. Two brothers who were local farmers, Peter and Jacob Loucks, realized the impact the railroads could have on the area and laid out a small townsite consisting of 24 lots, which went on sale in 1872. Scottdale was incorporated as a borough on February 5, 1874 and at that time named in honor of Thomas A. Scott, who had been president of the Pennsylvania Railroad and served as Assistant Secretary of War during the Civil War. Because Scottdale sits atop major coal deposits, the community flourished due to the surrounding coal mines, as well as ovens for converting coal into coke (fuel). The H. C. Frick Coke Company, controlled by Henry Clay Frick, was headquartered here. Scottdale‚Äôs factories in the early 20th century also produced iron pipe, tin, knives, steam engines, and caskets. Scottdale has two sites on the National Register of Historic Places: Scottdale Armory (1929) at 501 North Broadway Street, and the Scottdale Historic District, which encompasses the oldest parts of the borough. The oldest extant building in the borough is the Jacob Loucks House at 115 Walnut Avenue, built in 1853. Otherwise, the borough‚Äôs oldest residences are concentrated on Loucks Avenue, where many houses date from the 1880s. As well, three downtown retail buildings can be dated to approximately 1880: 101 Pittsburgh Street, 143 Pittsburgh Street, and 4-10 South Broadway Street. The West Overton Museum in Scottdale is the only pre-Civil War village still intact today in Pennsylvania. It was named to the National Register of Historic Districts in 1985 as an outstanding example of a 19th-century rural industrial village complete with farm, two floors of the Overholt Mill/Distillery, industrial tools, Blacksmith Shop, a wash house and a smokehouse.

Name Origin, History and Current Resources  Slickville is best known for its unusual name which is tied to its history. As with so many other Appalachian mining communities Slickville was named for a mining official: Donald Slick of the Cambria Steel Company see Cambria Iron Company in this case. Slickville was founded in 1917 and included many of the amenities not found in older company mining towns. It also benefited from a relatively large 'downtown' area that was shared between it and the adjacent towns of Jamison (or Elrico) and nearby Patton. Slickville is also well known for its Hollywood-style SLICKVILLE sign located on its mine \\"boney\\" pile and it's Someplace Special (with a backward S) and Slickville University Logo's. Slickville's heyday lasted until 1942 when the mine was closed; however it still retains most of its original company housing, along with the company store, mine car repair shop, mine office (with jail in the basement), grade school (closed in 1985), four churches (including St. Slyvester's Catholic, Presbyterian Church, Holy Ghost Ukrainian Orthodox, Baptist (closed circa 2000), 'boney' pile and official's houses including the superintendent's house. While most original company housing remains in good condition several of the smaller 'cottage' houses have been removed and several of the downtown area business buildings are now either private residences or have been removed. This includes the removal of the former Ukrainian association building which later became the civic center around 1995, the Nickolas Kitch confectionery store around 2005 and Nick Zerebnick's barber shop around 2010. The Pennsylvania railroad last ran through town in the late 1950s; however the railbed from Slickville to Saltsburg was made into a hiking trail in the fall of 2007 and extended to near Delmont in roughly 2011 (with plans to extend this trail to Trafford and an eventually link with the Great Alleghany Passage trail system in Braddock). The ballfield was redone with help from the Slickville Lions around this time. Current (2018) business and civic buildings include the 'new' 1995 civic center with tax collector Becky Maruca's office (a small library closed in roughly 2012), a post office, the 'new' circa 1995 Sportsman club, Slickville Auto Body & Truck Panels founded by Robert Paouncic in 1983, a health clinic building that originally was a bank closed near 2010, and Slickville Deli owned by Carrie Hult. Historical business buildings serving as residences include the former K&S; bar, the former Yvonick's storefront, the former Kitch hardware store, the former Damico's Deli, the former DeFrances GE Appliance store and the former Baker lumber company. Sam Grabick's GM Auto Dealer & Garage was a Slickville landmark, later occupied by Mike and Jimmy Kitch's Garage (with John Sheliga's autobody shop downstairs in the 1960s). 3rd generation owner Brian Kitch has moved the shop to nearby Patton, but most people still identify it as being a Slickville institution. Since the closing of the 5 Slickville mines by 1942, the nearby Patton and Jamison mines in the 1950s, and the near total abandonment of mining of 'high sulfur' coal in the area since the 1980s, Slickville has benefited economically from its proximity to other cities in the area. These include service manufacturing jobs in locales such as Greensburg, Jeannette, Latrobe and eastern Pittsburgh area suburbs. As of 2007 Slickville was still beyond the outer edge of East Pittsburgh suburban housing developments although suburban areas such as Murrysville are only 5 to 6 miles away.

The land was passed on to his son, Jacob Rugh, and later to Jacob's son, Peter Rugh. The Rugh family house is still extant at 1213 Broad Street. The current building dates from the Civil War, but was built on the foundation of a much older structure. The area was known as Rughtown, although it was not yet a town in any meaningful sense. In the 1870s, a local industrialist, George Franklin Huff, bought of the Rugh farm. In 1881, this was sold to Greensburg Coal and Coke Company (later Keystone Coal and Coke Company), which established a mine and brickyard along Broad Street. Fifty workers' houses were built in 1888. During this time, the community was known as Huff, Hufftown, or, Pennsylvania Huff's Station. A trolley line was constructed in 1890 along Broad Street, running north into Greensburg. This line was later acquired by West Penn Railways, which operated trolley service until 1952. In 1891, the community was incorporated as the Borough of South Greensburg. Coal strike of 1910-1911 The borough was the scene of violence during the Westmoreland County Coal Strike of 1910‚Äì1911. In July 1910, a group of striking coal miners were authorized to conduct a protest by the borough's Chief of Police, William B. Keltz. Some sources spell the Chief's name as Ketz, but Keltz is correct. A confrontation ensued between the marchers and security personnel working for Jamison Coal and Coke Company. In the resulting melee, one miner, Peter Gale, was shot by J.A. Willis, who was a member of the company's security forces. Chief Keltz attempted to arrest the shooter and instead was arrested himself by constables under Jamison's control.

The population was 2,155 as of the 2010 census. History In 1769, John Peter Miller was granted provisional ownership of land within the current-day boundaries of Southwest Greensburg, and he received full ownership rights in 1789. Miller was told that the first settler traditionally has the right to name a community, and when Miller was asked what name he preferred for the area, he responded with \\"What you please?\\" As a result, the community - at that point a mere collection of farms - bore the unusual name \\"What You Please?\\" for many decades, in what was undoubtedly an expression of settlers' sense of humor. In 1887, Richard Coulter and George Franklin Huff, both of whom had attained wealth in the local coal industry, saw the possibilities of developing the area as a residential community. Coulter and Huff purchased land from a farmer, John Mace, in 1887, and a community was laid out consisting of 413 lots. The first recorded use of the name \\"Southwest Greensburg\\" occurred in 1888, when Coulter and Huff's plan was submitted to the county courthouse. Southwest Greensburg was incorporated as a borough on November 15, 1890. The first borough election was held on February 17, 1891, in which John Putnam was elected as the borough's first burgess (mayor), together with other borough officials. A key element of the community's development was the Greensburg & Hempfield Street Railway, which built a trolley line on Greene Street in 1890. Shortly afterward, the company built an amusement park called \\"Electric Park\\" to increase trolley traffic. The boundaries of \\"Electric Park\\" were (approximately) Greene Street, Main Street, Welty Street, and Weaver Street. Nothing of \\"Electric Park\\" remains, which was eventually redeveloped as residential lots. The trolley line itself was later acquired by West Penn Railways and operated until January 3, 1937.

Etymology Dutch (Van der Grift): topographic name from Middle Dutch grifte ‚Äòman-made channel' History In the 1890s the Apollo Iron and Steel Company ended a bitterly contested labor dispute by hiring replacement workers from the surrounding countryside. To avoid future unrest, however, the company sought to gain tighter control over its workers not only at the factory but also in their homes. Drawing upon a philosophy of reform movements in Europe and the United States, the firm decided that providing workers with good housing and a good urban environment would make them more loyal and productive. In 1895, Apollo Iron and Steel built a new, integrated, non- unionized steelworks and hired the nation's preeminent landscape architectural firm, Olmsted, Olmsted and Eliot, to design the model industrial town: Vandergrift. (named for Capt. J.J. Vandergrift, a director of the steel company). Mosher (1995) shows how Vandergrift was representative of the new industrial suburbs of Pittsburgh. Caught up in a dramatic round of industrial restructuring and labor tension, Pittsburgh steelmaker George McMurtry hired Frederick Law Olmsted's landscape architectural firm in 1895 to design Vandergrift as a model town. McMurtry believed in what was later known as welfare capitalism, with the company going beyond paychecks to provide for the social needs of the workers; he believed that a benign physical environment made for happier and more productive workers. A strike and lockout at McMurtry's steelworks in Apollo, Pennsylvania, had prompted him to build the new town. Wanting a loyal workforce, he developed a town agenda that drew upon environmentalism as well as popular attitudes toward capital's treatment of labor. The Olmsted firm translated this agenda into an urban design that included a unique combination of social reform, comprehensive infrastructure planning, and private homeownership principles. The rates of homeownership and cordial relationships between the steel company and Vandergrift residents fostered loyalty among McMurtry's skilled workers and led to McMurtry's greatest success. In 1901 he used Vandergrift's worker-residents to break the first major strike against the United States Steel Corporation.Anne E.

Formerly, the manufacture of radiators and boilers were the chief industries. The population was 2,633 at the 2010 census.  History  The town traces its roots to 1788, when a group of American pioneers to the Northwest Territory led by Gen. Rufus Putnam traveled overland from Massachusetts and stopped at this location to build boats. They then set out down the Youghiogheny River to the Monogahela and Ohio Rivers, ending their journey and founding the town of Marietta, Ohio. Former names of the town are Simeral's Ferry (also, Sumrill‚Äôs Ferry) and Robbstown. Eighteen miners lost their lives in West Newton in 1901 at the Port Royal Mine. right right The Dick Building and Plumer House are listed on the National Register of Historic Places. Like many pioneer towns in Western Pennsylvania, West Newton earned its early historical relevance by playing a key role in the westward expansion of the United States. The Simerals were the first family to operate in this area and operated a small ferry on the Youghiogheny River halfway between Connellsville and McKeesport. A New Jersey native and whiskey rebel named Isaac Robb, laid out the town of West Newton, however, it was originally called \\"Robbstown\\". The town grew slowly as the community served as a trading outpost where the Old Glades Indian trail met the Youghiogheny River. West Newtons fortunes changed during the mid 19th century. River commerce increased with the construction of slack water dams in the 1830s. The introduction of the Pittsburgh, Connellsvile, and Markles Paper Mill provided early economic developments. Despite facing devastating fires, floods and tragic train wrecks in the 20th century, the people of West Newton persevered, continuing to develop both the infrastructure and economy of their community. As time progressed West Newton eventually transitioned into a bedroom community with a vast majority of residents working outside of the boroughs limits.

Youngstown was incorporated on 2 April 1831. The population was 326 at the 2010 census. The borough has its own post office with zip code 15696. History The town was named after Alexander Young, whose first lot was recorded November 25, 1815, in the Recorder's office of Westmoreland County. There was a dispute to the name of the town over if it should be called Martinsburg or Youngstown. The name Youngstown was settled upon after it was found that a town of Martinsburg already existed in the Commonwealth. James Keenan's recorded plan of land on April 3, 1816 recorded the town as Youngstown Borough. As the community grew, and more people settled in the area, the citizens formed a political government. The residents petitioned the legislature in Harrisburg to form Youngstown Borough out of their lands. Governor George Wolf approved act No. 168 of 1830, on April 2, 1831. This act erected Youngstown, in the County of Westmoreland, into a Borough. Act No. 168 laid out the borough lines, and provided for elections of the burgess and other town officials, and stated the duties of the officials. As the town progressed, the residents felt themselves restricted by the Act of 1830 and petitioned Westmoreland County Court of Quarter Sessions to become subject to the Act of April 3, 1851. The Act of 1851 provided for more modern borough government than that permitted by the previous special act of legislature. The residents of the borough and their officers did not act quickly, since the petition to become subject to the Act of 1851 was not approved by Borough Council until July 25, 1905. The opening of the Pennsylvania Government Land Office in the area in 1769, and the contract of the Pennsylvania Proprietaries with the Indians opened up the Loyalhannah Valley for settlement for pioneers, many of whom were of German and Scotch- Irish descent. Christopher Saxman in 1764, and Frederick Pershing in 1769 were the first recorded settlers in the area of present-day Youngstown. As a community and village grew, it was often called Martinsburg, after Martin West, another nearby land owner. Located along the Forbes road, a military road built under the command of Brigadier General John Forbes in 1758, the town became an important rest stop along the east-west route that eventually stretched from Philadelphia to Pittsburgh. In 1794, Federal troops passed through and quartered at the town's Barrett Hotel on the way to quell the Whiskey Insurrection. Until 1796, Youngstown, often referred to as Martinsburg, had been randomly settled, with various people making claims to the land. The first recorded transaction of land came on March 31, 1796, when Robert Dickey received a warrant from the Commonwealth of Pennsylvania for a tract of land known as \\"Hermitage\\". John Moore, a surveyor, pursuant to the warrant, issued a survey showing of land. Robert Dickey conveyed Hermitage to Joseph Baldridge by deed dated February 18, 1797. The Commonwealth of Pennsylvania, through the offices of Governor Thomas Mifflin, issued a patent to Joseph Buldridge for the tract of land known as Hermitage on April 1, 1797. Joseph Baldridge, another settler that built a mill in the area, was conveyed a deed for a tract of land known as \\"Hermitage\\" in 1797. Lots on the land began to be sold in 1800. Alexander Young recorded the lots sold in 1815, and after a dispute between the names Martinsburg and Youngstown, the town received its name on April 3, 1816. General Arthur St. Clair, who had retired near Youngstown, died near his home there, ‚ÄúHermitage‚Äù, in 1818. The Greensburg-Stoystown Turnpike was constructed along the old Forbes road in 1819, leading to more traffic and prosperity for the borough, which was now the largest town and served as a market place, with taverns, blacksmiths, wagon makers, harness shops and a variety of other merchants, and a post office for the region. The community continued to grow and on April 2, 1831, the citizens formally formed the borough as a political government. J. G. Karns was the first Burgess of Youngstown. The Pennsylvania Railroad introduced train service through neighboring Latrobe in 1852, leading to a decline as merchants moved closer to the railway and the Greensburg-Stoystown Turnpike was less frequently used. As the automobile became popular, the turnpike became the Lincoln Highway which brought traffic through Youngstown. U.S. Route 30, constructed in the 1930s, bypassed Youngstown, leading it to become a quiet residential community. The Kingston House, a center for trade and commerce and hotel dating from 1800, was listed in the National Register of Historical Places on June 30, 1983.

October, 1916 Council ordered the borough weigh scales removed from Main Street. March 6, 1918 Council adopted the contract of the State Highway Department for street paving. August, 1818 - Arthur St. Clair, General in the Continental Army, member of the Continental Congress and the 9th President of the United States in Congress Assembled in 1798, the first Governor of the Northwest Territory, the first Commander of the U.S. Army, 1791‚Äì92) died in poverty on the Old State Road between Ligonier and Youngstown, when he was riding a wagon into town and probably had a stroke. He lived on top of the Laurel Ridge in a home and land given to him by his son Daniel. (There is a state marker at the site of his house, the house being torn down many years ago.) Arthur had run an inn where travelers stopped for food and supplies for their horses. His wife Phoebe was an invalid by this time and she died a week later. Both are buried under a Masonic monument in St. Clair park one block from the courthouse in Greensburg. His daughter, Louisa St. Clair Robb, and her six children were living with Arthur and Phoebe as were Elizabeth St. Clair Lawrence (a widow) and her children. Arthur and his family left Hermitage around 1810, when the property was foreclosed by his creditors and all of his personal and real property was sold to satisfy debts. These debts had been incurred mostly when Arthur St. Clair signed his bond for Indian Treaties as well as other expenses in the Northwest Territory for which Congress authorized the funds, but never appropriated the money, leaving St. Clair without reimbursement. Also, debts due him from funds loaned to the government for the costs of the Revolution were never reimbursed, the government claimed that the statute of limitations had expired! The old Hermitage house was torn down back in the 1950s and a Mrs. Mellon got word of it and had the parlor severed from the house and trucked to the new location of what would be the Ligonier Museum. The museum was built around the parlor. Mrs. Mellon authorized funds to purchase many of the things that were auctioned in the 1810 foreclosure sale and had them placed in the parlor and also in the collection of the museum. It is said that Arthur told his children to continue to petition the government for their inheritance, and in 1857 Congress appropriated $30,000 (which was a fraction of what was due) to the Arthur St. Clair Memorial, to be divided to the six branches of the family, with each branch receiving $5,000.

From the south, the Maryland Central Railroad reached Delta in 1883 and began operating trains from Delta to Bel Air, Maryland and Baltimore in 1884. Both lines were later succeeded by the Maryland and Pennsylvania Railroad, which operated until 1978. The slate quarry was a major freight customer until 1971.

Education Post office Dover's public schools are operated by the Dover Area School District. Intelligent design controversy Dover received national attention in 2004‚Äì05, after the Dover Area School District voted to include the following statement about intelligent design in the biology curriculum of its schools: :The Pennsylvania Academic Standards require students to learn about Darwin's Theory of Evolution and eventually to take a standardized test of which evolution is a part. :Because Darwin's theory is a theory, it continues to be tested as new evidence is discovered. The theory is not a fact. Gaps in the theory exist for which there is no evidence. :A theory is defined as a well-tested explanation that unifies a broad range of observations. :Intelligent Design is a religious explanation of the origin of life that differs from Darwin's view. The reference book Of Pandas and People is available for students who might be interested in gaining an understanding of what Intelligent Design actually involves. :With respect to any theory, students are encouraged to keep an open mind. The school leaves the discussion of the Origins of Life to individual students and their families. As a Standards-driven district, class instruction focuses upon preparing students to achieve proficiency on Standards-based assessments. :Kitzmiller v. Dover Area School District (page 1) Aftermath The controversial statement by the school board triggered the court case Kitzmiller v. Dover Area School District in late 2005. The case was resolved on December 20, 2005, when Judge John E. Jones III ruled that the Dover Area School District cannot teach Intelligent Design in a science class room, due to its religious origins. The separation of church and state principle, as derived from the First Amendment to the United States Constitution, prohibits any government agency from endorsing religious points of view. In an upset election on November 8, 2005, the eight Republican school board members who voted for the language were all defeated by the challengers from the Dover Cares slate‚Äîfour Democrats and four Republicans, forced by election rules to run on the Democratic ticket‚Äîwho opposed the teaching of intelligent design in a science class. Over the past few years Dover has incorporated a Comparative Religion course as an elective for students who want to learn more about all the religions of the world. Pat Robertson Two days after the upset, Pat Robertson commented on the election results on The 700 Club: :I'd like to say to the good citizens of Dover: If there is a disaster in your area, don't turn to God. You just rejected Him from your city. He later revisited his previous warning: :God is tolerant and loving, but we can't keep sticking our finger in His eye forever. If they have future problems in Dover, I recommend they call on Charles Darwin. Maybe he can help them.
