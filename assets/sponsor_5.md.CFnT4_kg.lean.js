Officially named the \\"Christian Educational Institution of the Mennonite Denomination\\", it accepted men aged 18 to 35 for a three-year program centering on biblical studies and other topics relevant to training pastors and mission workers. Starting in 1876, women were accepted as day students. Classes were primarily taught in German and some in English. Instruction was divided among three departments: theology, German and English. The theology department classes covered biblical and church history, biblical theology, doctrine symbolics, catechism instruction and homiletics. Classes in the German department included reading, writing, grammar, spelling, composition and world history. The English department taught a wide variety of subjects including reading, writing, orthography, grammar, geography, arithmetic, analysis of sentences, rhetoric, logic, elementary algebra, higher algebra, geometry, trigonometry, physical geography, natural philosophy, physiology, botany, chemistry, history of the United States plus other branches usually found in academies and colleges.Pannabecker p. 56. The principal, Carl Justus van der Smissen (1811–1890),Kaufman pp. 130-137. was hired from among European Mennonites, who generally had more education than North American Mennonites. Enrollment averaged 34 students annually over its eleven-year history, somewhat over half of whom were Mennonites. The institute produced a generation of Mennonite leaders of the late 19th and early 20th centuries. In spite of its short history, the institute was a significant development among North American Mennonites. It was the first major cooperative project, involving like-minded Mennonites from Ontario, Pennsylvania, Ohio and states west to Iowa. The process of promoting, raising funds and building the school was one of the uniting points of the fledgling General Conference Mennonite Church. It represented a significant departure from an anti-education tradition and opened the way for trained and paid ministers within the church. The school broadened the views of its students who, in turn, helped move their congregations away from insular practices of the past. The promotion of missions generated the first Mennonite mission workers from North America. Conflicts between van der Smissen and other key staff members developed, but the school's end was largely a result of low attendance, financial difficulty and debt. The supporting churches had two other concerns dividing their resources: new mission projects and eighteen thousand Russian Mennonite immigrants who were arriving in North America. In 1878 the building and property were sold in order to meet the institute's financial obligations. Wadsworth laid the groundwork for future General Conference Mennonite Church seminaries: Halstead Seminary (1883) the forerunner of Bethel College, Witmarsum Theological Seminary (1914–1931) part of Bluffton College and Mennonite Biblical Seminary (1945) now Associated Mennonite Biblical Seminary. The building site eventually became the location of Isham Elementary School, part of the Wadsworth public school system. The original bell from the building's cupola was moved to Associated Mennonite Biblical Seminary in 2002.Shelly. Notes References *Kaufman, Edmund G.

The brother-in-law of Brigham Young, he was a member of the vanguard company of Mormon pioneers that entered the Salt Lake Valley on July 24, 1847. He designed the Salt Lake Temple, the Lion House, the Beehive House, the Utah Territorial Statehouse, the St. George Utah Temple, and other public buildings. Angell's modifications to the Salt Lake Tabernacle are credited with perfecting the acoustics for which the building is famous. Early life Angell was born on June 5, 1810, in Providence, Rhode Island, the third son of seven children born to James W. Angell and Phebe Morton. Between the ages of 17 and 19, Angell learned the carpenter and joiner's trade from a man in the neighborhood of his family home. However, due to problems that his mother had with his father, at age 21 he moved with his mother to China, New York (near her family), where he met and married Polly Johnson. Truman's sister Mary Ann Angell married Brigham Young. Early work in the Church At age 23, Angell joined the Church of Jesus Christ of Latter Day Saints along with his mother and his wife, and the following spring he served a mission for the church for nine weeks, traveling 500 miles. His mission companion was his cousin Joseph Holbrook (their mothers were sisters).Holbrook autobiography The following July, he and his wife settled in Lima, New York. In the fall of 1835, they moved to Kirtland, Ohio, and Angell helped build the Kirtland Temple. He was soon ordained a member of the Second Quorum of Seventies and the following spring commenced making arrangements to go on a mission. With a day or two of work left, Joseph Smith approached him at work and asked him to build a store. Angell answered, \\"that in consequence of being a seventy I was about to go out into the vineyard to preach\\". \\"Well,\\" Smith said, \\"Go ahead,\\" and Angell continued his work. In Angell's words he says: > The next day I looked up and saw the First Presidency of the Church > together, distant about forty rods. I dropped my head and continued my work. > At this time a voice seemed to whisper to me, \\"It is your duty to build that > house for President Smith,\\" and while I was meditating, I looked up and > Brother Joseph Smith, Jr., was close to me. He said, \\"It is your duty to > build that house.\\" I answered, \\"I know it.\\" Accordingly I changed my > determination and yielded obedience. The numerous and continued calls to do > this and that job soon plunged me in business so deep that I asked Brother > Joseph if it was my calling to work at home. He said, \\"I'll give you work > enough for twenty men.\\" Angells.com cache at archive.org During the dedication of the Kirtland Temple, Angell recorded the following in his journal: > When about midway during the prayer, there was a glorious sensation passed > through the house [Kirtland Temple]; and we, having our heads bowed in > prayer, felt a sensation very elevating to the soul. At the close of the > prayer, F. G. Williams being in the upper east stand—Joseph being in the > speaking stand next below—rose and testified that midway during the prayer > an holy angel came and seated himself in the stand. When the afternoon > meeting assembled, Joseph, feeling very much elated, arose the first thing > and said the personage who had appeared in the morning was the Angel Peter > come to accept the dedication.\\" Angell moved with the Latter Day Saints to Far West, Missouri, and then to Nauvoo, Illinois. Nauvoo Temple Harper's Monthly Angell later went on to work on the Nauvoo Temple, having been appointed superintendent of joiner work under church architect William Weeks, carrying out the architect's designs in the construction of that temple. On the construction of the Nauvoo Temple, Angell served as the superintendent of the joiners.Jenson, Andrew. Encyclopedic History of the Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints. (Salt Lake City, Utah: Deseret News, 1941) p. 138. Work in the West After the dedication of the Nauvoo Temple, Angell moved to Iowa and then went further west. He left his wife behind in Winter Quarters and went on with Brigham Young's pioneering company, entering the Salt Lake Valley in July 1847. Angell then returned to Winter Quarters in the fall of 1847. Three of his children died and were buried in Winter Quarters, and he moved to the Salt Lake Valley with his sick wife and his remaining two children. Salt Lake Temple in 1892 Angell was appointed Church Architect by Brigham Young on January 26, 1850. In this position, he was in charge of the construction of numerous buildings in Utah Territory, including the St. George Temple, and the Salt Lake Temple. Angell's modifications to the Salt Lake Tabernacle in 1870 are said to have resolved the outstanding acoustical issues with that structure. In 1851, Angell polygamously married Susan Eliza Savage, who had been a textile worker in the Lowell, Massachusetts, cotton mills in the early 1840s until she migrated to Salt Lake City after joining the LDS Church. In 1855 he married a third time to Mary Ann Johnson. Angell was originally asked to also be in charge of the design and construction of the Manti and Logan Temples, but in consequence of their being about 100 miles distant from him in different directions, they were placed in the care of his two assistants. Truman O. Angell, Jr., supervised the construction of the Logan Temple and William H. Folsom was responsible for the Manti Temple, while Angell stayed and worked on the Salt Lake Temple. After his son completed the Logan Temple, he assisted his father with work on the Salt Lake Temple. In April 1856, Young asked Angell to leave his family and go to Europe so that he could learn the architectural designs there. After he returned from his mission to Europe, Angell continued to labor on the Salt Lake Temple. From 1861 to 1867, Angell had stepped down as Church Architect due to poor health and was replaced by William Folsom. However, in April 1867, Angell was again sustained by church members as church architect. Even during the time that he was not church architect, Angell worked closely with the construction of the Salt Lake Temple. He continued to serve as Church Architect until his death on October 16, 1887, at the age of 77. For more than 35 years he had worked on the Salt Lake Temple. It was said that he knew every stone in its walls. Of Angell, Wendell Ashton wrote: \\"As long as the Salt Lake Temple stands, there will be a magnificent monument to the patience, skill and dedication of its architect.\\" Although Angell did not live to see the temple completed, he was a key mover behind its being built. Angell was buried in Salt Lake City Cemetery. A number of Angell's works are listed on the National Register of Historic Places. Image:TrumanAngellGrave.jpgGrave marker of Truman O. Angell.

J. Simpson's post-trial life. Farber is the daughter of radio talk pioneer Barry Farber and a graduate of New York University. Farber has written extensively about HIV/AIDS and AIDS denialists such as Peter Duesberg. Although she has repeatedly stated that she has \\"remained objective\\" in her writings and never stated that HIV does not cause AIDS, her writings have been criticized by scientists and journalists for promoting AIDS denialism. Spin columns In 1987, at the encouragement of Bob Guccione Jr., her editor at Spin magazine, Farber began exploring questions related to the role of the HIV virus in AIDS. She wrote and edited a monthly column in Spin titled \\"Words From the Front\\" from 1987 to 1995, which was focused on the subject of AIDS denialism. She says that her interest in the field was sparked when, as an intern at Spin, she heard of AL-721, a lipid mixture derived from eggs that was proposed as an anti-HIV drug. She stated, \\"I was very young, and I believed instantly in the mythological fantasy that there was a quote 'cure' for AIDS that was being suppressed by the government and by the pharmaceutical industry.\\" Farber's second Spin column was an interview with prominent AIDS denialist Peter Duesberg. In a later interview, she noted her first interview aroused response for what she believed was touching on the \\"taboo\\" of questioning the mainstream view that HIV causes AIDS. In another interview, she said she recognized that publishing an interview with Duesberg would be viewed as an endorsement of his denialist views, but believed as a journalist it was her responsibility to report on what she considered an important event in the \\"landscape\\" of AIDS. She also stated she felt that as a journalist, she was not qualified to determine what causes AIDS. In a 1989 column for Spin, Farber interviewed researchers and doctors who felt AZT, the first approved antiretroviral medication for the treatment of HIV, had been pushed precipitously through the United States Food and Drug Administration approval process owing to political pressures. She criticized this process because she felt it led to ignoring other possible treatments, and believed she had to \\"give voice\\" to the small minority of scientists at that time who felt AZT was dangerous. Her column was criticized by the scientist running trials on AZT, as \\"sensationalistic drivel of half- truths and noncritical journalism that sells tabloids\\" and could lead to people avoiding life-saving treatment with AZT. Farber rejected criticism that this column was essentially scaring people into avoiding AZT, saying that was not her intent. A Los Angeles Times column criticized the tone of her column as \\"fear-mongering\\" and \\"inexcusable,\\" due to her giving Duesberg the last words in her column. Duesberg's words were called \\"hyperbolic blather\\", because Duesberg invoked Heinrich Himmler and compared people taking AZT to \\"people running into the gas chambers\\". \\"Out of Control\\" Farber published a 2006 Harper's article, \\"Out of Control: AIDS and the corruption of medical science,\\" which criticized the ethics of the antiretroviral drug industry and examined the arguments by Duesberg that HIV does not cause AIDS. Farber's article was widely criticized for its promotion of AIDS denialism and its many inaccuracies. A New York Times op-ed written by scientists described Farber's article as promoting \\"deadly quackery\\" for denying the \\"established fact\\" that HIV causes AIDS, which could lead to resurgence of the disease if people began to believe HIV was harmless. The Columbia Journalism Review chided Harper’s for \\"giving...legitimacy\\" to \\"an illegitimate and discredited idea.\\" Harper's editor Roger Hodge defended Farber from criticism, stating Farber was \\"courageous\\" for covering a story that came at \\"great personal cost\\". Farber said that she did not endorse the Duesberg hypothesis and that she had approached the story as an objective journalist, stating: \\"People can't distinguish, it seems, between describing dissent and being dissent.\\" An article in the New York Observer juxtaposed her stated position of not endorsing Duesberg's views with previous statements she made questioning the mainstream view of HIV, and questioned whether she had herself become a \\"dissenter\\".\\"Celia Farber: Has the Dissenter Become the... Dissentee?\\" Published online by the New York Observer, March 13, 2006. Accessed October 30, 2006. In response to Farber's column, leading AIDS researchers published a 37-page rebuttal to Duesberg's views, whose views these researchers believed were long disproved in the medical community, while others in the medical community criticized her column for being poorly fact checked and containing \\"glaring errors\\". Seth Kalichmann, HIV researcher, has stated this Harper's column \\"represented a breakthrough of HIV/AIDS denialism into mainstream media\\". Maggiore article In June 2006, Farber wrote an article for the Los Angeles CityBeat in defense of Christine Maggiore, an HIV-positive AIDS denialist who avoided antiretrovirals during pregnancy and did not have her children tested for HIV. Maggiore's daughter, Eliza Jane, was found to be HIV- positive only after the 3-year-old died of pneumonia as a complication of AIDS.Charles Ornstein and Daniel Costello, \\"A Mother's Denial, a Daughter's Death\\", Los Angeles Times, September 24, 2005. Accessed February 16, 2007. Maggiore died of pneumonia in 2008, at the age of 52. Maggiore's death certificate noted that she had extensive signs of opportunistic infections consistent with late-stage AIDS. Serious Adverse Effects A collection of Farber's AIDS writings, Serious Adverse Events: An Uncensored History of AIDS, was published in 2006. Interviewed by Discover Magazine in connection with her book's publication, she stated that she felt many of the older mainstream ideas about HIV were proven wrong and defended the decision to devote her reporting to the AIDS-denialist viewpoint as important for journalistic reasons. In 2008 she was awarded the Semmelweis Clean Hands Award for her reporting on AIDS.http://www.jamesphogan.com/bb/bulletin.php?id=1143 Other work Farber describes herself as \\"a vocal and persistent critic of political correctness and the McCarthyism that reigned in sexual harassment law in the 1990s.\\" During her time as a writer at Spin, Farber was romantically involved with the magazine's publisher and editor, Bob Guccione Jr.Farber, Celia (June 9, 1997). \\"The Trial\\" . Salon. In 1994, a Spin employee filed a sexual harassment lawsuit against Guccione Jr. and the magazine, alleging sexual discrimination and favoritism.Sheelah Kolhatkar, \\"AIDS Anarchist Farber Hops Back in Whirlwind\\", The Observer, 28 June 2006. Accessed October 30, 2006. Farber was a key witness in the ensuing trial, as the prosecution alleged that Farber's relationship with Guccione Jr. led to her promotion and other job opportunities. Ultimately, the jury found that Spin editors had created a \\"hostile environment\\" and awarded $90,000 to the plaintiff; the remainder of the charges, including those of sexual favoritism, were rejected. In 1999, Farber co-founded the nonprofit organization Rock the Boat. The organization's mission was to arrange rock music concerts to stimulate independent thinking about subjects which the organization's proponents believed had been censored by the media. Farber also worked as a ghost writer on the books How I Helped O.J. Get Away With Murder by Mike Gilbert and The Murder Business: How The Media Turns Crime Into Entertainment and Subverts Justice by Mark Fuhrman. Farber maintains a blog at her website and hosts a radio show called \\"Radio Free Science\\" every Friday at 3 p.m. on the Progressive Radio Network. Personal life She is the daughter of Barry Farber, a noted radio talk-show host in New York, and Ulla Farber. She has a sister Bibi who became a singer and songwriter. In 1993, their mother, Ulla Farber, was working as a nurse at Askersund Hospital in Askersund, Sweden. Farber married guitarist Robert Bannister on December 12, 1993. Farber and Bannister had a son, Jeremy, together. They have since divorced.

Campus The school campus is located in central Little Rock. Interstate 630 (the Mills Freeway) was constructed just north of the campus, which is bounded by 10th and 14th streets to the north and south, and Gaines and Chester streets to the east and west. The core of the campus was originally built for Little Rock Junior College (now the University of Arkansas at Little Rock), and a two- block section of it is listed on the National Register of Historic Places. One of its centerpieces is the former U.M. Rose School building, now the Cox Administration Building, designed by the noted Arkansas architect John Parks Almand in 1915, when he was working for Charles L. Thompson. The campus also includes the \\"Old Gym\\", a gymnasium built by the WPA during the Great Depression; and a former barracks building of the Camp Robinson Air Force Base, which was moved here in 1948.  Athletics  Philander Smith teams, nicknamed the Panthers, are part of the National Association of Intercollegiate Athletics (NAIA), primarily competing in the Gulf Coast Athletic Conference (GCAC). Men's sports include basketball and track & field; while women's sports include basketball, cheerleading, track & field and volleyball. Philander Smith's 2012–13 men's basketball team made history by bringing home their 1st Gulf Coast Athletic Conference (GCAC) tournament title. On Feb. 21, 1989, Philander Smith gained a 92–89 victory over Rust College of Holly Springs, Mississippi, on their court, ending the longest home-court winning streak in NCAA Division III women's basketball history.

The squadron, known as the \\"Ridge Runners\\", is based at Marine Corps Air Station Miramar, California and falls under the command of Marine Aircraft Group 16 (MAG-16) and the 3rd Marine Aircraft Wing (3rd MAW). The Squadron's nickname, \\"Ridge Runners\\", was bestowed as a result of typhoon rescue and relief operations in the mountainous terrain surrounding Hagman, Japan. Mission Provide assault support transport of combat troops, supplies and equipment during expeditionary, joint or combined operations. Be prepared for short- notice, worldwide deployment in support of Marine Air-Ground Task Force operations. History =Vietnam War= HMR(L)-163, the predecessor of HMM-163, was formed in December 1951. From February to October 1965, the HMM-163 \\"Ridge Runners\\" helicopter squadron became famous for its operations in Vietnam. This was primarily due to a LIFE magazine photo-essay by Larry Burrows \\"One ride with Yankee Papa 13\\" that documented the combat death of Marine H-34 pilot 1st Lt James E. Magel and the rescue of wounded gunner Sgt Billie Owens during a mission transporting Army of the Republic of Vietnam (ARVN) troops near Danang on 31 March 1965.Burrows, Larry. \\"One Ride with YP-13\\", Life Magazine, April 1965. (photo essay) For most U.S. citizens, this was the first time they were made aware of the extent of America's involvement in Vietnam. In late October 1965, HMM-163 relocated to Marine Corps Air Station Futenma in Okinawa, Japan. Capt Al Barbes, the Squadron Intelligence Officer and husband to a Filipina bride, offered a suggestion. Because of Asian culture and beliefs, he proposed that eyes painted on the unit aircraft might have an unsettling effect upon the enemy, thus the concept of \\"The Eyes\\" on the front of HMM-163 aircraft was born. On January 1, 1966, HMM-163 flew by C-130 to Phu Bai, Vietnam, relieved HMM-161, and took over all their H-34 helicopters. Painting of what were then called \\"Genie Eyes\\" (after the \\"I Dream of Jeannie\\" TV show) began immediately. By March 1966, HMM-163's \\"Genie Eyes\\" were being called \\"Evil Eyes\\" by the ground units supported. On March 9, 1966, the 95th Regiment of the People's Army of Vietnam (PAVN) 325th Division attacked the Special Forces camp in the A Shau Valley about 30 miles (50 km) southwest of Hue in Thua Thien Province. It was strategically important for the PAVN as a major infiltration route because it was adjacent to the Ho Chi Minh Trail. Defending the camp were 10 Green Berets and 210 South Vietnamese Civilian Irregular Defense Group, supported by Air Commando units equipped with vintage A-1 Skyraiders and AC-47 Spooky gunships. The squadron flew over 2,000 flight hours in ten days during the battle in which 190 survivors were rescued from enemy capture. They did this in the face of heavy enemy anti- aircraft fire. During the battle, 21 of the 24 aircraft assigned to the squadron suffered \\"major damage\\" including the two that were shot down.Sturkey, Bonnie-Sue, pp. 18–23. In October 1966, the squadron again returned to Phu Bai, still with black and white \\"Evil Eyes\\", under the command of LtCol Otto Bianchi. LtCol Bianchi was a good friend of the Wing Commander, but that didn't keep Major General Louis Robertshaw, 1st MAW Commanding General, from reading LtCol Bianchi the \\"riot act\\" concerning the unauthorized paint scheme. Also in the room at the time of this conversation was the Commanding General of the Marine ground forces in the area, who politely interrupted by saying, \\"It sure is great to have the 'Evil Eyes' back here at Phu Bai!\\" The 1st MAW Commanding General relented and the \\"Evil Eyes\\" have remained to this day. The squadron remained in Vietnam until August 1968. =1990s= During the 1990s, HMM-163 continued to excel while serving as the Aviation Combat Element (ACE) for five Special Operations Capable Marine Expeditionary Units (MEU(SOC)) on deployments to the Pacific and Central Command theaters. During this time, the squadron participated in operations across the Pacific and from the Horn of Africa to the Persian Gulf, including Operation Fiery Vigil in 1991, Operation Continue Hope, Operation Distant Runner, and Operation Quick Draw in 1994, Operation Desert Strike in 1996 and Operation Resolute Response in 1998. Global War on Terror Alternate squadron patch picturing the evil eyes In 2001, while deployed with the 15th Marine Expeditionary Unit(SOC), the Evil Eyes of HMM-163 again had the opportunity to serve America with distinction by participating in combat operations in support of Operation Enduring Freedom. While forward deployed to the Central Command Theater of Operations, the Evil Eyes planned and executed the longest amphibious assault in American military history with the seizure of a Forward Operating Base (FOB) in southern Afghanistan. This was accomplished through the use of a 4-aircraft detachment of CH-53E helicopters, which are capable of in-flight refueling. They had been attached to the squadron 8 months earlier in preparation for deployment as the Air Combat Element of the 15th MEU (SOC). The squadron remained forward deployed for seven weeks operating from the austere base in support of Task Force 58 and other coalition Special Operations Forces. In 2003, the Evil Eyes deployed from August 22, 2003 to March 8, 2004 with the 13th Marine Expeditionary Unit. Again, the squadron made history by being part of the first Expeditionary Strike Group One (ESG-1). The ESG concept focused on combining surface action groups and submarines with traditional Amphibious Ready Groups (ARGs) and MEUs to offer theater combatant commanders more flexibility and capabilities. During this deployment HMM-163 participated in security operation in the southern Iraqi city of Basrah in support of Operation Iraqi Freedom.

Chocolate liqueur is a liqueur that tastes like chocolate. History There is mention, in French, of producing and selling chocolate en liqueur as early as 1666. Context suggests this is a chocolate liqueur, not a chocolate liquor or cocoa bean extract nor any other chocolate flavored beverage. In New England prior to the 18th century American Revolution, a \\"chocolate wine\\" was popular. Its ingredients included sherry, port, chocolate, and sugar. A French manual published in 1780 also describes chocolate liqueur. An 1803 French pharmacy manual includes a recipe for a chocolate liqueur (ratafia de chocolat, also ratafia de cacao). An early 19th-century American cookbook, published in 1825 and preserved in an historical archive in South Carolina, includes a similar recipe. Throughout the 19th century and into the early 20th century, manuals and encyclopedias in French, English, and Spanish give similar recipes. A late 19th century food science manual gives a recipe that includes techniques for clarifying and coloring the liqueur. A similar early 20th century manual gives four recipes. In 1994, there were several brands of chocolate liqueur on the market; this is attributed to a 1990s \\"chocolate craze\\". Recipes Early 19th century recipes for chocolate liqueur featured whole cocoa beans. A basic modern recipe for making chocolate liqueur at home lists the ingredients chocolate extract, vanilla extract, vodka, and simple syrup. To keep the chocolate extract in suspension and make the liqueur thicker, glycerine may be added. In its purest form, chocolate liqueur is clear; coloring may be added. Recipes for home-made chocolate liqueurs may also include raw eggs as an ingredient, presenting a risk of salmonellosis. Reasonable safety may be achieved by combining the eggs with the alcohol before other ingredients. Earlier, liquor was made by adding the cocoa beans to classic liqueur. Modern chocolate wine can be considered as a subspecies of chocolate liquor. Chocolate liqueur brands , Dark chocolate liqueur Uses Chocolate liqueur can be consumed straight, as an after dinner drink rather than as aperitif. It is used in mixed drinks and in desserts, especially in dessert sauces, cakes, and truffles. A food writer notes that many recipes for chocolate truffle add a small amount of chocolate liqueur to melted chocolate, and warns that adding the liqueur often causes the chocolate to seize. One of the more unusual uses is in chocolate rolled fondant. Arguably the most controversial use may be in connection with a scandal concerning the provenance of certain 17th century bottles of wines said to have belonged to Thomas Jefferson, and traded by Hardy Rodenstock. Benjamin Wallace writes in his book The Billionaire's Vinegar that at a wine tasting of 19th century wines from Château Latour, provided by Rodenstock, several people noted the wines had a flavor of chocolate liqueur and were fakes. Wine and chocolate are a classic flavor pairing, and this is reflected in some cocktails that combine a strong red wine with a dash of chocolate liqueur. Varieties There are three types of chocolate liqueur: liqueur, cream liqueur, and crème de cacao. =Chocolate liqueur= * Afrikoko (coconut and chocolate) * Ashanti Gold * Bicerin Di Giandujotto * Djangoa (with a hint of anise) * Godiva Dark Chocolate * Liqueur Fogg * Mozart Black (dark chocolate) * OM Dark Chocolate & Sea Salt Liqueur * Royal Mint-Chocolate Liqueur (French) * Sabra liqueur (dark chocolate and Jaffa oranges) * Thornton's Chocolate Liqueur =Chocolate cream liqueur= * Cadbury Cream LiqueurCadbury's Cream Liqueur: A Case History International Journal of Wine Marketing 1992, Vol. 4, Issue 2, pp. 33-37.

It is sometimes known as the big C class to differentiate it from the C class of 1873. History and construction In the late 1920s, trainloads were getting heavier as mainline locomotives became more powerful and increasingly capable of pulling larger loads, but the locomotives assembling and shunting these trains in railway yards were struggling to cope with the weight. Some of the older mainline locomotives that had been displaced by the newer locomotives were modified to perform shunting duties, but this was not an adequate solution. The decision was therefore taken by Chief Mechanical Engineer G. S. Lynde to design a new shunting locomotive and a committee was formed to plan the design features of the new locomotives. The chief designing engineer, R. J. Gard, initially wanted a 0-8-0 tender locomotive. While it was agreed the new locomotive would be a tender engine rather than a tank locomotive as possibly considered, it would also be designed to pull passenger trains as well as work as a heavy shunter. The existing WF class 2-6-4T tank locomotive was to be used as the basis of the new locomotive, which was to be built by NZR at their Hutt Workshops in Wellington and Hillside Workshops in Dunedin. The C class as built were fitted with superheated boilers with wide fireboxes and developed 30% greater tractive effort than the Canterbury J class 2-6-0s and with a light axle loading to give the same amount of running rights as the U class 4-6-0s. The cab was the same as that fitted to the AB class while there were notable elements of American design in the slope-backed tender and a multiple- valve front-end throttle, and also design elements from W. G. Bagnall, whom Gard had worked for prior to joining the NZR in 1926. Twenty-four locomotives were built at Hutt and Hillside, a total of 12 each, starting in October 1930 with C 845 and ending in November 1931 with C 868. Service The C class were placed into service initially in Auckland, Wellington, and Christchurch although some locomotives did spend short periods of time in Dunedin following overhaul at Hillside Workshops or as a short-term allocation following their completion. It was found that while the C class were extremely capable, the locomotives were insufficiently heavy enough to move some of the larger trains being shunted. This led to the conversion of the BB class 4-8-0s to shunting and branch line service in order to replace the C class on these heavier duties. During their service life, the C class occasionally handled suburban trains with the Wellington-based examples doing so at times over the Hutt Valley line. The Auckland-based locomotives tended to do so only on the Onehunga Branch, while the Christchurch-based locomotives did so infrequently. It was not unknown for the Christchurch-based examples of the C class to work further afield and members of the class have been noted as working the Little River, Methven, Oxford, and Whitecliffs branches, as well as occasionally handling race trains to Sockburn. Due to the arrival of the DS class and DSB class diesel shunters in 1955, the Wellington locomotives were displaced and sent to Auckland and Christchurch. Of the twenty-four, twelve were withdrawn in 1963-64 but the other engines continued running until 1968 by which time only Christchurch had a permanent allocation. During World War II, the decision was made to fit several Wellington-based engines, particularly of the C class, with fire-fighting pumps in case of a Japanese air raid. At least one locomotive, C 849, was so fitted but the boiler-mounted pumps were not successful and relied on sufficient water supply from the locomotive's boiler to function. Following the cessation of hostilities, these pumps were quickly removed. Withdrawal The first two C class locomotives were withdrawn in July 1963. A further eight had been withdrawn by the end of that year, with the rest being withdrawn between 1964 and 1968. By this time only three C class locomotives were left, among them C 847 and C 864. The last, C 847, was retired in October 1968. By that time the NZR&LS; Canterbury Branch had purchased C 864 for preservation, and it was trucked from storage at Linwood locomotive depot in 1974 to Ferrymead Heritage Park. One of the more unusual appointments for a C class locomotive was the use of C 849 in 1963 as the oil- holding tank at Addington Workshops.Brown, Keith, Addington Railway Workshops: Working with Wood, NZR&LS; 2009\\\\. p. 19. The locomotive had been withdrawn but was instead converted to replace a modified UC tank wagon. Although only the tender was required for this conversion, the engine unit of C 849 remained attached until the boiler house was decommissioned and the locomotive was scrapped. C 847 was not scrapped after withdrawal but instead remained at Linwood as a source of spares for C 864. This led to the NZR&LS; Wellington Branch making an offer to purchase the relatively complete locomotive. This led to some disapproval from the Canterbury Branch, who had already stripped many good parts from it. The hulk of C 847 was towed to Wellington in 1974, suffering an overheated axle bearing along the way. Preservation Two C class locomotives have been preserved: * C 847 (Hillside 255/1930) was withdrawn in October 1968 and used as a source of spare parts for the NZR&LS; Canterbury Branch, who had purchased C 864 for preservation. In 1974, it was purchased by the NZR&LS; Wellington Branch and was towed to their Seaview site where it remained until its transfer to the new Silver Stream Railway in the 'big move' of 1984. It remained stored at the SSR until it was trucked to the Glenbrook Vintage Railway in 1990. The locomotive was comprehensively restored over a four-year period and re- entered service in 1994 on the GVR. While there it made several trips on the main line to Hamilton and Huntly before returning to the SSR. C 847 is currently operational at the Silver Stream Railway and runs once a month and for special events. * C 864 (Hillside 272/1931) was withdrawn in 1968 but remained stored at Linwood locomotive depot until 1971 when it was purchased for preservation by the NZR&LS; Canterbury Branch. It was trucked to Ferrymead in 1972 and entered service there as one of two steam locomotives in regular service, the other being a small Manning, Wardle 0-4-0ST saddle tank locomotive built in 1914. Overhauled in 1982, C 864 returned to service in 1984 and made several mainline trips to Rangiora and Lyttelton as part of the Rail 125 celebrations in 1988. Currently, C 864 is out of service and stored in the locomotive shed at Moorhouse station on the Ferrymead Railway. Its boiler certificate expired in 1994 and will require new tyres and tender repairs according to the Canterbury Railway Society website.

The screenplay by Kriss Turner focuses on interracial relationships and traditional African American family values and social customs. Plot Kenya McQueen (Sanaa Lathan) is a successful, single African American woman who has sacrificed romance in order to pursue a career as a certified public accountant. Her obsessive compulsive desire for perfection and control has manifested itself in the bland, monochromatic decor of her new home and the rigid rules she follows in her personal life. Urged to loosen up by her friends, Kenya accepts a blind date with landscape architect Brian Kelly (Simon Baker) arranged by her co-worker Leah Cahan (Katharine Towne), who is in the process of planning the kind of wedding Kenya wants herself. The two meet at Starbucks, and she is surprised to discover Brian is white. She quickly excuses herself and leaves. The two unexpectedly meet again at a party at Leah's parents' home, where Brian landscaped the grounds. Impressed with his work, Kenya decides to hire him to renovate her unkempt backyard garden. As time passes, their employer-employee relationship evolves into a friendship and then love. Although Brian is helping her feel more comfortable about her living environment, Kenya finds it difficult to dismiss her reservations about their romance. The opinions of her girlfriends Cheryl (Wendy Raquel Robinson), Nedra (Taraji P. Henson), and Suzette (Golden Brooks), her upper class parents Joyce (Alfre Woodard) and Edmond (Earl Billings), and her womanizing younger brother Nelson (Donald Faison) begin to have a deleterious effect and Brian's unwillingness to discuss issues of color drives them apart. Nelson introduces his sister to someone she views as a more acceptable suitor, tax attorney Mark Harper (Blair Underwood), who has just relocated to Los Angeles. The two begin to date, and while Joyce thoroughly approves, Edmond senses his daughter is not as happy as she was with Brian. Everything Kenya thought she wanted suddenly seems immaterial, and nothing Mark does ignites a spark between them. When the dissonance she’s developed finally overwhelms her, Kenya chooses to reunite with Brian, no longer allowing her controlling nature and social norms to dictate matters of the heart. Kenya marries Brian amongst their closest friends and loved ones.

On Rotten Tomatoes, the film has an approval rating of 61% based on 109 reviews with an average rating of 6.04/10. According to Metacritic, the film received an average score of 64 out of 100, based on 28 reviews. Manohla Dargis of The New York Times called the film \\"a pleasantly diverting romance ... [in which] the chemistry between the leads is as unmistakable as the setup is contrived ... The lovely Ms. Lathan ... and the similarly attractive Mr. Baker ... don't just look good together; they feel right in sync. Their easy, sensual rapport partly owes something to the generally sure hand of the film's director, Sanaa Hamri, making a fine feature debut, and something else, something indefinable, to the delectable mysteries of two bodies in cinematic motion.\\"New York Times review Roger Ebert of the Chicago Sun-Times rated the film 3½ out of four stars and commented, \\"I found myself unexpectedly moved.\\" He continued, \\"By the end, Something New delivers all the usual pleasures of a love story, and something more. The movie respects its subject and characters, and is more complex about race than we could possibly expect. With this film and the completely different but also observant Queen Latifah comedy Last Holiday, black women are being paid a kind of attention they deserve but rarely get in the movies.\\"Chicago Sun-Times review Kevin Crust of the Los Angeles Times called the film \\"superficial and formulaic but pleasant enough to entertain and qualifies as intelligent and sophisticated by the current standard of Hollywood comedy.\\" He added, \\"The movie nicely captures the area around Baldwin Hills, is crisply written by Kriss Turner and portrays the upper- middle class black community seldom seen in mainstream TV and film. However, the characterizations, even the leads, rarely rise above archetypes. The film's lack of depth as it oversimplifies the complexities of racism keep it from being anything other than a lightweight date movie.\\"Los Angeles Times review Ruthe Stein of the San Francisco Chronicle said, \\"The trouble with the movie is that it sometimes seems at odds with itself, vacillating between a realistic presentation of the obstacles black professional women face finding a suitable mate and another bit of Hollywood fluff where their skin color is glossed over.\\"San Francisco Chronicle review Steve Persall of the St. Petersburg Times graded the film B and commented, \\"I like the way Something New presents facets of African-American life seldom seen in mainstream movies, such as the formality and brief funkiness of a debutante cotillion ball, the affluent sophistication making such events important. I like Hamri's approach to material that might be offensive from a solidly black or white perspective. It all makes the foundational sameness of the story easier to take. The basic story isn't new, but telling it this way is really something.\\"St. Petersburg Times review Brian Lowry of Variety observed, \\"Wispy at best, this romantic comedy from a first-time director and screenwriter feels as if whole chunks have been left on the cutting-room floor, with what remains mustering intermittent charm thanks to the attractiveness, if not chemistry, of Sanaa Lathan and Simon Baker ... Perhaps the best thing the movie has going for it, actually, is that despite the title, there's really nothing new here at all; rather, the beats are so familiar the audience can fill in the gaps themselves.\\"Variety review Award and nominations * NAACP Image Award for Outstanding Actress in a Motion Picture (Sanaa Lathan, nominee) * NAACP Image Award for Best Director of a Feature Film or Television Movie (Sanaa Hamri, nominee) * Black Reel Award for Best Screenplay (Kriss Turner, winner) * Black Reel Award for Best Film (nominee) * Black Reel Award for Best Actress (Sanaa Lathan, nominee) * Black Reel Award for Best Director (Sanaa Hamri, nominee) * Black Reel Award for Best Original Score (nominee) * Black Reel Award for Best Original Soundtrack (nominee) * Black Movie Award for Outstanding Achievement in Screenwriting (Kriss Turner, winner) * Black Movie Award for Outstanding Performance by an Actress in a Lead Role (Sanaa Lathan, nominee) * Black Movie Award for Outstanding Performance by an Actress in a Supporting Role (Alfre Woodard, nominee) DVD release On May 16, 2006, the film was released on DVD in Region 1 in two versions, one in anamorphic widescreen and the other in fullscreen format.

Zimmermann was a member of the Yale Class of 1956, and a member of Scroll and Key Society. He died of pancreatic cancer at his home in Great Falls, Virginia on February 3, 2004.Warren Zimmerman [sic] Dies - The Washington Post Retrieved 2018-05-03. Career Warren Zimmermann served in Moscow (1973–75 and 1981–84), Paris, Caracas and Vienna, where he headed the US delegation at the Conference on Security and Cooperation in Europe (1986–89). But it was Yugoslavia that marked him more than any other phase in his professional life, and brought him to prominence. =Bosnian War= Zimmermann played an active diplomatic and geopolitical role during the initial stages of the Bosnian War. According to Robert W. Tucker, Professor Emeritus of American Foreign Policy at Johns Hopkins University and David C. Hendrickson, a Professor at Colorado College, Zimmermann may have scuttled the Lisbon Agreement also known as Carrington- Cutileiro peace plan. That was an agreement that would have made peace between three main ethnicities, Bosniaks, Serbs, and Croats, living within the bounds of Bosnia and Herzegovina by the creation of a cantons system, such as exist in Switzerland. At a time when Bosnia-Herzegovina was sliding into war along ethnic lines, this plan proposed ethnic power-sharing on all administrative levels and the devolution of central government to local ethnic communities. On 28 March 1992, ten days after the agreement had been signed by each of the three sides, Zimmermann came to Sarajevo to meet with Alija Izetbegović, president of the Presidency of Bosnia and Herzegovina, giving Izetbegović assurances of U.S. support for a full independent nation without internal division. Within days of meeting Zimmermann, Izetbegović withdrew his signature and renounced the peace plan he agreed to in Lisbon, suddenly declaring his opposition to any type of ethnic division of Bosnia and Herzegovina. Within weeks a full blown war developed. Three and a half years later, the Dayton Accord that all three sides accepted in November 1995 thus ending the war, featured a very similar canton system, dividing Bosnia- Herzegovina internally along ethnic lines. Writing in 1997, Alfred Sherman, British political analyst and an adviser to Margaret Thatcher, described Zimmermann's involvement in Bosnia, along with American overall foreign policy in the Balkans, as: \\"lying and cheating, fomenting war in which civilians are the main casualty, and in which ancient hatreds feed on themselves\\".America's Intervention in the Balkans;March 1997 As the Bosnian conflict developed into a full war during spring 1992, Zimmermann supported the policy of foreign military interventionism. According to journalist Samantha Power, the author of A Problem from Hell: America and the Age of Genocide, Zimmermann’s career in Yugoslavia was marked by \\"frustration with the resistance of the Bush administration to intervene\\". His last official act before he was recalled to the United States on 16 May 1992, was to write a confidential memo called \\"Who Killed Yugoslavia?\\" to the secretary of state. Each of the five sections of the memo was headed by a verse from the poem \\"Who Killed Cock Robin?\\". In Zimmermann's analysis, the nationalism of the Balkan leaders had led to the demise of the country. Zimmermann resigned from the diplomatic service in 1994 in protest at President Bill Clinton's reluctance to intervene in the Bosnian War. He campaigned to persuade the U.S. that it must act to end what he reportedly saw to be \\"Serbian aggression in the killing fields of Bosnia\\" and was of the opinion that \\"NATO air strikes against the Serbs at any point during the war would have stopped the war and brought a negotiated agreement\\". Zimmermann went on to teach at Johns Hopkins University (1994–96) and Columbia University (1996–2000), and spoke out against human rights violations. Zimmermann wrote an account of his experiences in Yugoslavia, The Origins Of A Catastrophe (1996). According to what he wrote in the book, Franjo Tuđman claimed that Bosnia should be divided between the Croats and the Serbs in what came to be known as the Karađorđevo agreement. \\"Tuđman admitted that he discussed these fantasies with Milošević, the Yugoslav Army leadership and the Bosnian Serbs,\\" writes Zimmerman, \\"and they agreed that the only solution is to divide up Bosnia between Serbia and Croatia\\".W. Zimmermann, Origins of a Catastrophe: Yugoslavia and Its Destroyers 1996 Works Following his ambassadorship in Yugoslavia, Zimmermann authored two books: Origins of a Catastrophe: Yugoslavia and Its Destroyers -- America's Last Ambassador Tells What Happened and Why, published in 1996, and First Great Triumph: How Five Americans Made Their Country a World Power, a work about Theodore Roosevelt, Henry Cabot Lodge, John Hay, Elihu Root, and Admiral Alfred T.

It is a form of ventricular fibrillation (V-Fib), not mechanical damage to the heart muscle or surrounding organs, and not the result of heart disease. The fatality rate is about 65 percent even with prompt CPR and defibrillation, and more than 80 percent without. Commotio cordis occurs mostly in boys and young men (average age 15), usually during sports, most frequently baseball, often despite a chest protector. It is usually caused by a projectile, but can also be caused by the blow of an elbow or other body part. Being less developed, the thorax of an adolescent is likely more prone to this injury given the circumstances. The phenomenon was confirmed experimentally in the 1930s, with research in anaesthetized rabbits, cats and dogs. Causes = Sport = Commotio cordis is a very rare event, but nonetheless is often considered when an athlete presents with sudden cardiac death. Some of the sports which have a risk for this cause of trauma are baseball, American football, association football, ice hockey, polo, rugby football, cricket, softball, pelota, fencing, lacrosse, boxing, professional wrestling, and martial arts (see Touch of Death). Children are especially vulnerable, possibly due to the mechanical properties of their thoracic skeleton. From 1996 to spring 2007, the USA National Commotio Cordis Registry had 188 cases recorded, with about half occurring during organized sports. Almost all (96%) of the victims were male, the mean age of the victims during that period was 14.7 years, and fewer than one in five survived the incident. =Other situations= Commotio cordis may also occur in other situations, such as in children who are punished with blows over the precordium, cases of torture, and frontal collisions of motor vehicles (the impact of the steering wheel against the thorax, although this has decreased substantially with the use of safety belts and air bags). In one fatality, the impact to the chest was the result of an exploding whipped cream canister. In contrast, the precordial thump (hard blows given over the precordium with a closed fist to revert cardiac arrest) is a sanctioned procedure for emergency resuscitation by trained health professionals witnessing a monitored arrest when no equipment is at hand, endorsed by the latest guidelines of the International Liaison Committee on Resuscitation. It has been discussed controversially, as—in particular in severe hypoxia—it may cause the opposite effect (i.e., a worsening of rhythm—commotio cordis). In a normal adult, the energy range involved in the precordial thump is 5 to 10 times below that associated with commotio cordis.Kohl P, Sachs F & Franz M (eds): Cardiac Mechano-Electric Feedback and Arrhythmias: from Pipette to Patient. Elsevier (Saunders), Philadelphia 2005. Mechanism  Diagram showing the portion of normal sinus rhythm during which commotio cordis is a risk These factors influence the chance of commotio cordis: * Direction of impact over the precordium (precise area, angle of impact) * Total applied energy (area of impact versus energy, i.e., the kinetic energy of the projectile E_\\\\text{k} =\\\\tfrac{1}{2} mv^2 ) * Impact occurring within a specific 10– to 30-millisecond portion of the cardiac cycle. This period occurs in the ascending phase of the T wave, when the ventricular myocardium is repolarizing, moving from systole to diastole (relaxation). The small window of vulnerability explains why it is a rare event. Considering that the total cardiac cycle has a duration of 1 second (for a base cardiac frequency of 60 beats per minute), the probability of a mechanical trauma within the window of vulnerability is 1 to 3 percent only. That also explains why the heart becomes more vulnerable when it is physically strained by sports activities: # The increase in heart rate (exercise tachycardia) may double the probability above (e.g., with 120 beats per minute the cardiac cycle shortens to 500 milliseconds without fundamentally altering the window-of-vulnerability's size) # Relative exercise-induced hypoxia and acceleration of the excitoconductive system of the heart make it more susceptible to stretch-induced ventricular fibrillation. The cellular mechanisms of commotio cordis are still poorly understood, but probably related to the activation of mechanosensitive proteins, ion channels. These trigger extra electrical excitation waves which, if occurring right at the trailing edge of a previous electrical cycle, can give rise to ventricular fibrillation. Since the trailing edge of the preceding electrical cycle travels over the ventricular surface, the critical window for mechanical induction of ventricular fibrillation varies locally - i.e. the commotio cordis risk window exists in time and in space. This helps to explain why precordial impacts tend to have benign consequences. Impact energies of at least are estimated to be required to cause cardiac arrest, when applied in the right time and spot of the precordium of an adult. Impacts up to have already been measured with hockey pucks and lacrosse balls, in karate punches, and in boxer Rocky Marciano's punch. The 50-joule threshold, however, can be considerably lowered when the victim's heart is under ischemic conditions, such as in coronary artery insufficiency. Also an upper limit of impact energy is applied to the heart; too much energy will create structural damage to the heart muscle, as well as causing electrical upset. This condition is referred to as contusio cordis (from Latin for bruising of the heart). On isolated guinea pig hearts, as little as 5 mJ were needed to induce release of creatine kinase, a marker for muscle cell damage. Obviously, this figure does not include the dissipation of energy through the chest wall, and is not scaled up for humans, but it is indicative that relatively small amounts of energy are required to reach the heart before physical damage is done. Prevention The risk would probably be reduced by improved coaching techniques, such as teaching young batters to turn away from the ball to avoid errant pitches, according to doctors. Defensive players in lacrosse and hockey are now taught to avoid using their chest to block the ball or puck. Starting in 2017, high school lacrosse players are penalized, and play stopped immediately, if they enter their own goal crease with the apparent intent of blocking shots or acting as goalkeeper.Rule 4.18.4, Chest protectors and vests are designed to reduce trauma from blunt bodily injury, but this does not offer protection from commotio cordis and may offer a false sense of security. Almost 20 percent of the victims in competitive football, baseball, lacrosse and hockey were wearing protectors. This ineffectiveness has been confirmed by animal studies. Development of adequate chest protectors may prove difficult. Treatment Defibrillator training kit Most cases are fatal. Automated external defibrillators have helped increase the survival rate to 35%. Defibrillation must be started as soon as possible (within 3 minutes) for maximal benefit. Commotio cordis is the leading cause of fatalities in youth baseball in the US, with two to three deaths per year. It has been recommended that \\"communities and school districts reexamine the need for accessible automatic defibrillators and cardiopulmonary resuscitation-trained coaches at organized sporting events for children.\\" Legal issues Several people have been charged and convicted for deaths of victims of commotio cordis, even when the blows rendered were never given with an intent to kill. In 1992, Italian hockey player Miran Schrott died after a blow to his chest from the stick of Canadian-Italian player Jimmy Boni. Boni was charged with culpable homicide, and eventually pleaded guilty to manslaughter, paying a $1,300 fine and $175,000 restitution to Schrott's family.

The land near the area was a burial ground for the Pearsall family starting in the 17th century, but the burial grounds were later removed. The high school opened in September 1958 and had its first graduating class in 1960. Known for the \\"Herricks Prayer Case, Engel v. Vitale,\\" the Herricks School District (a.k.a. Union Free School District #9) was sued by five district property owners in 1959. \\"Almighty God, we acknowledge our dependence upon Thee, and we beg Thy blessings upon us, our parents, our teachers and our Country\\" was recited as a daily procedure on the recommendation of the NY State Board of Regents. This case was decided by the U. S. Supreme Court, which ruled the prayer unconstitutional in 1962. In 2013, Herricks High School celebrated the Herricks School District's 200th anniversary. In the late 2010s, the cafeterias received major renovations, creating a more inviting and open atmosphere. Music and theater The music department is home to ten different performing ensembles, including several advanced groups: Jazz Band, Wind Ensemble, Chamber Orchestra, and Chamber Choir. Herricks is also home to Chapter 1975 of the Tri-M Music Honor Society. Sports Herricks High School offers the following sports: football, badminton, softball, baseball, tennis, soccer, wrestling, volleyball, lacrosse, basketball, bowling, swimming, track, Winter Track and Field, golf, cross country, fencing, and cheerleading.

It is assigned to the 4th Operations Group and stationed at Seymour Johnson Air Force Base, North Carolina. The 336th was constituted on 22 August 1942 as an incorporation of the Royal Air Force 133 Squadron into the United States Army Air Forces' VIII Fighter Command. 133 Squadron was one of three RAF Eagle Squadrons composed of American volunteer pilots who enlisted in the RAF and fought in World War II prior to the United States entry into the war. At the height of conversion training, the 4th TFW was one of the first units tasked to react to Iraq's invasion of Kuwait in August 1990. The 335th and 336th Tactical Fighter Squadrons and support personnel deployed to Saudi Arabia, beginning in August 1990. The combat record of the 4th TFW in Saudi Arabia was exceptional, with the 336th TFS flying 1,088 combat missions during Operation Desert Storm. The unit dropped more than six-million pounds of bombs on Scud missile sites, bridges and airfields. Most of the missions were flown at night. Overview The \\"Rocketeers\\" fly the McDonnell-Douglas (now Boeing) F-15E Strike Eagle. It was the first operational F-15E squadron in the Air Force. Its aircraft are identified by the \\"SJ\\" tail code and yellow fin flash. Currently the squadron provides worldwide deployable aircraft and personnel capable of executing combat missions in support of worldwide Aerospace Expeditionary Force deployments to combat areas as part of the Global War on Terrorism. To date, the 336th have destroyed 459 enemy aircraft including the 4th Fighter Wing's sole MiG kill in Vietnam. History Don Gentile's P-51B \\"Shangri La\\" P-51D of the 336th Fighter SquadronAircraft is P-51D-10-NA Mustang serial 44-14277. This aircraft was shot down over Prague 16 April 1945 and the pilot was taken Prisoner of War. On 23 September 1942 the 4th Fighter Group moved to its initial airfield at RAF Debden; however, the 336th moved to a satellite field at RAF Great Sampford. They conducted operations from there until rejoining the group at Debden on 30 October 1942. Fighter aircraft escorted first bombing raid over Berlin, March 1944. On 21 June 1944, escorted bombers in the first shuttle bombing mission from England to Russia. Received Distinguished Unit Citation (DUC) for destroying enemy aircraft and attacking air bases in France, 5 March – 24 April 1944.

Deployed to Europe under dual-based mission concept in support of NATO objectives, 1978–1985. 4th FW F-15Es in Southwest Asia in 1992. Participated in initial attack on Iraq, 17 January 1991. During 1990–1994, shared quarterly rotation duties to Southwest Asia with 334th and 335th Fighter Squadrons. Since 1991, trained as combat ready fighter squadron prepared for rapid worldwide deployment of fighter aircraft to accomplish air- to-ground, air-to-air, strategic attack and deep interdiction missions. 336th F-15E patrols over Florida as the Space Shuttle Atlantis launches in the background Deployed to combat areas in Middle East as part of Global War on Terrorism, 2001–present. On 18 July 2009, F-15E serial 90-231 from the 336th Fighter Squadron crashed in eastern Afghanistan, killing the two-man crew, Captain Mark R. McDowell and Captain Thomas J. Gramith. The US military reported that the jet was not downed by enemy action. =2013 sequestration= Air Combat Command officials announced a stand down and reallocation of flying hours for the rest of the fiscal year 2013 due to mandatory budget cuts. The across-the board spending cuts, called sequestration, took effect 1 March when Congress failed to agree on a deficit-reduction plan. Squadrons either stood down on a rotating basis or kept combat ready or at a reduced readiness level called \\"basic mission capable\\" for part or all of the remaining months in fiscal 2013. This affected the 336th Fighter Squadron with a stand-down grounding from 9 April-30 September 2013.

Klein (born 1938) is an American sportswriter and the author or co-author of 18 books on sports and business. From 1977 to 2001, Klein was the Wall Street Journal's first-ever sports columnist, writing the Journal's twice-weekly sports column, \\"On Sports\\". Klein was born in Chicago and was raised in the city's Ravenswood neighborhood. A multi-sport letterman at Roosevelt High School, he also began writing as a high school student. Klein attended the University of Illinois at Urbana-Champaign and wrote both for the student Daily Illini and for the Champaign-Urbana Courier. Graduating from Illinois in 1959, Klein entered Harvard Law School, but left after a term to pursue journalistic opportunities and graduate work at the University of Michigan. In 1962, Klein joined the staff of the Pittsburgh Press, and joined the Wall Street Journal's Pittsburgh bureau in 1963, first covering the steel beat. Moving on to the Journal's main office in New York in 1967 and to the Chicago bureau in 1969, Klein increasingly focused on writing some of the newspaper's signature Page One features. Sports became an increasingly frequent topic of his Page 1 items, and in 1977, Klein was named the first- ever sports columnist for the Journal, a role he held into 2001. From 2001 to 2003, Klein was a columnist with Sports Business Journal. Klein's first book, Education of a Horseplayer, was published in 1968. It was followed in 1974 by News & The Market, written with , which focused on the impact of news on share prices. Later books by Klein included two compilations of his \\"On Sports\\" columns, the first being On Sports in 1988 and Sunflower Seeds and Seoul Food in 1992. He has also co-written several sports-related autobiographies, and his columns have been included in anthologies published by the Journal over the years. Currently in semi-retirement, Klein is dedicating his energies to environmental preservation and the publication of the \\"For The Love Of...\\" series of illustrated sports books. The series includes books about Golf, Baseball, the Chicago Cubs, the New York Yankees and the Boston Red Sox. Klein lives with his wife Susan in Scottsdale, Arizona.

It is located in the Canadian Rockies foothills, on Cowboy Trail, 32 km west of High River and 64 km south of Calgary. Highwood River flows west of the village. Longview is known for its view west toward the first range of the Rocky Mountains, its cattle ranching heritage and its natural resources (principally oil), but more importantly the open spaces, rivers (the Highwood) and some of the finest beef by most standards. Longview is also known as the home of Canadian Country Music star Ian Tyson.  Demographics  In the 2016 Census of Population conducted by Statistics Canada, the Village of Longview recorded a population of 307 living in 140 of its 151 total private dwellings, which represents no change from its 2011 population of 307. With a land area of , it had a population density of in 2016. In the 2011 Census, the Village of Longview had a population of 307 living in 131 of its 140 total dwellings, a 2.3% change from its 2006 population of 300. With a land area of , it had a population density of in 2011. The population of the Village of Longview according to its 2007 municipal census is 334.  History  The Long brothers, Thomas and Oliver, homesteaded at Big Hill, not far from where the village is now. Their last name combined with the view from the then post office, which was opened in 1908, is how the village was named. When the oilfields at Turner Valley were revived in 1936, Longview became known as Little New York. Little New York, had a sister town uphill to the north called Little Chicago. No one seems to know how Little Chicago and Little New York got their names and both towns actually grew up over night. In 1936 there was nothing there but an empty prairie field. Then, in 1937, oil was discovered at the level and people, most of them long out of work because of the great depression, came flocking and Little Chicago and Little New York were born. Buildings appeared like mushrooms. For the first time in years, men who without so much as a coat on their backs or a nickel in their pockets had the first money they had earned since the depression began. Today Little Chicago is gone and except a monument near the Cowboy Trail to the north of the village, little remains to show it ever existed. Little New York was more fortunate, as it is now the village of Longview. In 1991, Clint Eastwood's Academy Award-winning film Unforgiven was filmed in and around Longview, as was the television film starring Tom Selleck, Monte Walsh.

These fairs are primarily practiced by the Cantonese, and spread with Cantonese immigration.  History  The Lunar New Year Fair's history can be traced back to the Wanli Emperor age of the Ming Dynasty. By this time, peasants sold flowers in markets south of the Pearl River. These ancient flower markets were held every day at no fixed location. In the 1860s, the flower markets began to be held only during Lunar New Year's Eve. A particularly big fair was held in 1919. Shortly after the People's Republic of China was founded in 1949, many Cantonese people immigrated to Hong Kong from Guangzhou and other Pearl River Delta areas, taking the market tradition with them. It later spread overseas.  Lunar New Year Fair in different cities  = Hong Kong = In Hong Kong, fairs are held in various locations, notably Victoria Park and Fa Hui Park. These fairs gather hundreds of stalls for various goods. Half of the area sells auspicious flowering plants like narcissus, peony, chrysanthemum, peach and fruit plants like mandarin. The other half sells dry goods for Chinese New Year. The fairs draw many visitors as part of the custom of hang nin siu (行年宵, literally: walk the year night) or hang fa shi (行花市, literally: walk the flower market). The crowd peaks at a few hours before and after midnight of New Year's Day. Stall tenders try to sell off all their stocks in these few hours before the fair closes, because surplus flowers are normally destroyed (or left to charitable organisations). In the 2000s youths from various youth organisations, secondary schools and universities increasingly began operating stalls of their own. For example, in 2007, students from various schools set up stalls to sell many special products which are related to the pig, for example Pig Tissue Holder, Fatty Pork Chop Scarf, etc. Traditionally, the Governor of Hong Kong visited the fair annually, usually in Victoria Park. The Chief Executive of Hong Kong continues this tradition.  Locations in 2006  In 2006, fairs were held in: * Victoria Park, Causeway Bay * Fa Hui Park, Sham Shui Po * Cheung Sha Wan Playground, Sham Shui Po * Kai Tak East Playground, Wong Tai Sin * Kwun Tong Recreation Ground, Kwun Tong * Sha Tsui Road Playground, Tsuen Wan * Kwai Chung Sports Ground, Kwai Tsing * Shek Pai Tau Playground, Tuen Mun * Pedestrian Mall Opposite Yuen Long Public Swimming Pool and On Hing Playground, Yuen Long * Shek Wu Hui Playground, North District * Tin Hau Temple Fung Shui Square, Tai Po * Yuen Wo Playground, Sha Tin * Man Yee Playground, Sai Kung * Po Hong Park, Tseung Kwan O  Locations in 2007  In 2007, fairs were held in:Fair stall auctions set for November 13 news.gov.hk:Health and Community * Victoria Park on Hong Kong Island * Fa Hui Park, Cheung Sha Wan Playground, Morse Park and Kwun Tong Recreation Ground in Kowloon * Sha Tsui Road Playground in Tsuen Wan * Kwai Chung Sports Ground * the open space at the Tin Hau Temple in Tuen Mun * Tung Tau Industrial Area Playground in Yuen Long * Shek Wu Hui Playground in North District * Tin Hau Temple Fung Shui Square in Tai Po * Yuen Wo Playground in Sha Tin * Man Yee Playground in Sai Kung * Po Hong Park in Tseung Kwan O = Guangzhou = A stall in the Yue Xiu New Years Fair in Canton, 2010 Guangzhou is said to be the source of the Lunar New Year Fair. During the rule of the PRC, the Lunar New Year Fair was interrupted only once, for a few years during the Cultural Revolution. Guangzhou's fair is held 3 days before Lunar New Year's Eve. It sells New Year Trees and other goods. In Guangzhou, there is at least one fair in each district, which became a custom since the 1960s. The origin of such fairs can be traced back to the Ming Dynasty, although official records of the Lunar New Year Fairs in Canton are found first in the 1920s, when the city was under the rule of the Republic of China. The official name for the fair in Guangzhou is \\"flower market\\" (); however, the locals tend to use the term flower street (), referring to the fact that the fairs in Guangzhou are held on streets that are available for vehicles on normal days but turned into pedestrian zones during the days of the fair.

It can result in a variety of specific injuries to the heart, the most common of which is a myocardial contusion, which is a term for a bruise (contusion) to the heart after an injury. Other injuries which can result include septal defects and valvular failures. The right ventricle is thought to be most commonly affected due to its anatomic location as the most anterior surface of the heart. Myocardial contusion is not a specific diagnosis and the extent of the injury can vary greatly. Usually, there are other chest injuries seen with a myocardial contusion such as rib fractures, pneumothorax, and heart valve injury. When a myocardial contusion is suspected, consideration must be given to any other chest injuries, which will likely be determined by clinical signs, tests, and imaging. The signs and symptoms of a myocardial contusion can manifest in different ways in people which may also be masked by the other injuries. It is recommended that people with blunt chest trauma receive an electrocardiogram to determine if there are any irregularities with cardiac function. The presentation of an abnormal heart rhythm after sustaining a myocardial contusion can be delayed for up to 72 hours.  Etiology  The most common cause of blunt cardiac injury (BCI) is due to motor vehicle collisions. In evaluating causes for BCI, it is important to understand how the heart is situated within the thorax. It is protected to a certain degree by bony structures like the sternum, ribs and spine, thereby offering it significant protection and thus requiring substantial amounts of force to cause BCI. Motor vehicle collisions are implicated in most causes of BCI as significant deceleration can result in the heart tearing from its attachments to surrounding structures. It is important to note that there should be a high index of suspicion for BCI when evaluating injuries to the thoraco-abdominal area.  Pathophysiology  Possible mechanisms for BCI include direct, indirect, bidirectional, deceleration, blast, crush, concussive, or combined. A direct injury is the most common and occurs most likely near the end of diastole, during ventricular filling. Indirect injury results from increased preload on the heart secondary to spikes in venous circulation which can then lead to rupture of the heart. Bidirectional injuries are a result of compressive forces on the heart by both the spine and the sternum. Deceleration injuries occur when the heart is forcibly torn from its attachments, thereby leading to tears of the muscle and arteries. Commotio cordis is a condition seen in young, male athletes that results from BCI, and leads to sudden cardiac death within the context of benign changes of the heart on autopsy and no preexisting conditions. The impact of BCI in this condition likely puts the heart in ventricular fibrillation, thereby resulting in death. Structural and electrical disturbances are typical of BCI. Examples of structural injuries include intramural hematomas (which are benign and self-limiting in most cases), papillary muscle rupture, and septal injuries. Common electrical disturbances include premature ventricular contraction and transient bundle branch blocks. It is important for the clinician to monitor the patient’s EKG and conduct a thorough cardiovascular exam to evaluate for murmurs and abnormal heart sounds in these cases.  Signs and symptoms  In evaluating the patient with suspected BCI, important symptoms to look for include chest pain, shortness of breath, palpitations and at times, typical anginal symptoms. Cardiac risk factors can also help stratify the possibilities of such an injury. Medication histories should also be noted, as rhythm control agents can mask tachycardias that normally present with BCI. Common physical exam findings include tachypnea, abnormal lung sounds, tenderness to palpation of the chest wall, bruising, and fractures.  Evaluation  An ECG is recommended in those with possible BCI. Abnormal ECG findings should prompt the clinician to then place the patient on continuous telemetry monitoring. Troponin levels should also be ordered. Important to note, negative findings on both ECG and troponin levels do not exclude BCI, as symptoms may present later. If both ECG and troponin levels are abnormal, an appropriate next step in evaluation would involve ordering an echocardiography.  Treatment and management  As mentioned under Evaluation, an abnormal ECG and elevated troponin levels should elicit continued cardiac monitoring to look for possible arrythmias or cardiac failure. If an arrythmia is found, the patient should be treated as if he/she is a non-BCI patient with repletion of electrolytes, monitoring of acid-base status, and administration of medications as indicated. If clinical evaluation deems a patient severely compromised, an urgent cardiology evaluation must be made. Surgical intervention may also be required in some situations (rupture, tamponade), with pericardiocentesis as an appropriate next step in management.  Complications  Complications for BCI are rare but can include delayed rupture of the heart, complete AV block, heart failure, pericardial effusion and constrictive pericarditis. It is advised that patients thus be reevaluated in 3-6 months post-injury.

It is only found in an 11-km stretch of the Bloomfield River (between two large waterfalls) in northern Queensland. These waterfalls appear to have blocked the migration of more aggressive tropical freshwater fish species such as the sooty grunter (Hephaestus fuliginosus) that have presumably naturally displaced the Bloomfield River cod from its former range in prehistoric times. With its very limited distribution, the Bloomfield River cod is clearly a relict species. It is a very important relict species, however, as it is the most northerly distributed percichthyid species in Australia, and raises interesting questions on the biogeography of percichthyid fish in Australia and the history of their ancient colonisation of Australian rivers. The species name wujalwujalensis comes from the Wujal Wujal Aboriginal community on the Bloomfield River, and the genus name Guyu comes from the tribe's name for this fish. Bloomfield River cod are the only species in the genus Guyu. Though named after the Australian freshwater cod species that are the most famous members of the family Percichthyidae (e.g. Murray cod), the Bloomfield River cod has little resemblance to the cod species. In fact, it is very similar in shape and appearance to a juvenile golden perch in a gold/light bronze colouration. It can reach a length of SL.

A genus of six species in total, it has three species native to North America, and three more in eastern Asia. Derivation of Genus Name The name Triosteum is a compound of the Greek tria 'three' and osteon 'bone', in reference to the three hard pyrenes ( pips / pits ) in each drupe ( berry ) - giving the meaning 'having three pits ( as hard as ) bone'.Linnaeus, Carl Species Plantarum 1: 176. 1753. Description Triosteum spp. are perennial, herbaceous plants of rich woods. Each plant typically consists of at least one erect, round, hairy, fistular stem, 1 to 4 feet (0.3 to 1.2m) high, with opposite ovate-lanceolate entire leaves, and whitish to purplish flowers presented either in axillary whorls or terminal racemes. The fruit is a drupe. It may be white, yellow, orange, or red, depending on the species.

Laird was born in Fowlerville, New York and moved with his parents to Hillsdale County, Michigan. He attended Adrian College and enlisted at thirteen in the Sixteenth Regiment of the Michigan Volunteer Infantry in the Army of the Potomac during the American Civil War. At Gaines' Mill, a musket ball struck him in the breast; he was taken prisoner and held for six weeks at Libby Prison before being exchanged. Later he served at Chancellorsville and Gettysburg, and, after re-enlisting in 1864, took part in the Petersburg campaign. Over three years, from 1862 to 1865, he was wounded five times, and rose to the rank of major by the time he was seventeen. His two brothers both died in the war.Memorial Addresses on the Life and Character of James Laird,\\" 51st Congress 1st session (Washington, DC: Government Printing Office, 1891. He graduated from the law department of the University of Michigan at Ann Arbor and was admitted to the bar. He set up practice in Hastings, Nebraska in 1872 and was a member of the Nebraska constitutional convention of 1875. He was elected as a Republican to fill the newly created 2nd district seat to the U.S. House of Representatives to the Forty-eighth United States Congress. He supported the moderate coinage of silver and favored revision of the high protective tariff, but not to the extent that would make him support either the Morrison tariff bill of 1886 or the Mills tariff bill of 1888. In that respect, he stayed safely in the good graces of the national party, and beat Democratic challengers easily, even with Prohibition third party candidates carrying somewhere between three and ten percent of the vote in a congressional race. As a member of the Military Affairs Committee, he pushed through a bill to make provision for homes for disabled soldiers in every state in the Union. He also served on the Pensions committee.

Education Caton studied at the University of Chicago and received a PhD degree from Yale, with an (earned) D.Litt degree from Griffith University for his work in modern history.Hiram Caton Research Caton's work has been concerned with ethics in the sciences (particularly in life sciences and medicine), the history of ideas, and on biological bases for individual, social, and political behaviour. He has published some 175 articles, across six or seven fields—medical ethics and bioethics, human ethology, modern political and economic history, anthropology (with special attention to the Freeman-Mead controversy), philosophy (with emphasis on rationalism and positivism), crowd studies, identity psychology, and problems of the integration of biological/evolutionary factors into the social sciences, especially political science. He achieved notoriety as an AIDS denialist in the mid-1990s for his book The AIDS Mirage (1994), in which he charged Donald Francis with \\"inventing a viral epidemic\\" in 1982 at the Centers for Disease Control. He also wrote The Politics of Progress: The Origins and Development of the Commercial Republic, 1600–1835 in which he explores what he considers to be the political forces surrounding the application of technology to subduing nature. Modern science, he argues, was born more from these political forces than from the ideological ones (such as the Protestant Reformation) that he feels are more usually credited with it. The book was reviewed in more than 20 professional journals. Some reviewers stressed that it set forth a new interpretation of what drove the creation of capitalism, partly by tapping little-known historical sources. In it, Caton attributes the key phase to events and leaders in France, the Netherlands, and England in the 1650–1700 period. It offers interpretations of the French Revolution, of the founding of the United States of America, of Adam Smith's Wealth of Nations, and of the origin of the legend of wicked capitalism. Caton argues that Smith's conception of economics was pre-industrial (it failed to recognise that industrial technology had become a commodity) and states that the wicked capitalism legend was created in the 1820–1840 period by a clique of factory owners. In the book, Caton rejects the belief that the human species is evolving to a higher type. In The Origin of Subjectivity: An Essay on Descartes, Caton argues that Descartes based his epistemology on optics ('optical epistemology'); and that he used his metaphysics 'as a flag to cover the goods'-- a rationalist philosophy dedicated to 'the mastery and possession of nature'. Caton's publications on Margaret Mead, Derek Freeman, and the Samoa controversy are part of the standard literature. His edited volume, The Samoa Reader: Anthropologists Take Stock, remains the one comprehensive reader on the subject. Among his contributions to the volume are two studies on Freeman's psychology. They were featured in 2005 in a lead article in the Chronicle of Higher Education. Also in 2005, Caton was a consultant to the BBC for its documentary on the Freeman-Mead controversy, Tales from the Jungle. His last work focused on Charles Darwin. As a former officer of the International Society of Human Ethology, he worked to integrate the Society into the web of activities celebrating the bicentenary of Darwin's birth (2009). Caton also published a reinterpretation of Darwin's contribution to the establishment of evolution. He has also devised a new interpretation of Darwin's famous illness, which he presented at the ISHE conference in Detroit, August 2006. This research was to be included in The Darwin Legend.See also Hiram Caton, The Darwin Legend, [Quadrant (magazine)Quadrant Magazine 51(10):28–32, October 2007.

Set in the 24th century, the series follows the adventures of the Starfleet crew of the Federation starship Enterprise-D. In this episode, the Enterprise rescues a critically injured amnesiac who is undergoing a mysterious transformation. Plot The Enterprise discovers a crashed escape pod in an unexplored star system. Investigating, they find there is one critically injured passenger in the pod, and the crew brings him aboard the ship. Dr. Crusher determines the survivor will live due to the stranger's own amazing recuperative powers. Crusher also notes that the survivor's cells are mutating in some way. A couple of days later the stranger finally awakens, but has no memory of his life or identity. The crew decides to call him \\"John Doe\\". Some time passes and John has recovered physically, but still has amnesia. In addition, from time to time he suffers from severe pain which is somehow tied to his ongoing mutation. He also begins emitting strange, bright energy bursts. John soon learns that he is able to use this energy to heal injuries, as witnessed by Crusher when he aids a patient in her Sickbay. In the meantime, Geordi La Forge has determined the pod the Enterprise discovered was a kind of storage device. Geordi is also able to interpret a star chart and find the location of John's home planet. However, John's memory has begun to return, and he senses that he must not go back to his home planet yet. A day or so later, a vessel intercepts the Enterprise, and John declares he has to leave. He tries to steal a shuttle and an energy burst accidentally knocks Lieutenant Worf from a walkway, resulting in a fatal fall to the floor below due to a broken neck. John then uses his healing powers to revive Worf and heal his injuries. Prevented from escaping, John explains that he wanted to leave as he is becoming a danger to himself and the crew. Captain Sunad of the intercepting ship communicates with the Enterprise, announcing he is from the planet Zalkon and that he wants John returned to him. He explains that John is a criminal who has been given a death sentence. Captain Picard considers the situation, but refuses to release John to the Zalkonians without more information as to the charges. He contacts the other ship and mentions John's strange powers, which alarms Captain Sunad. Sunad immediately triggers a device which causes the entire Enterprise crew to become unable to breathe. John resists the device and heals everyone aboard the Enterprise with one bright flash of his energy. His memory now restored, John transports Sunad to the Enterprise using his powers. John explains that his race has reached a new stage in evolution, in which they are evolving into beings of energy. His homeworld's government fears what is happening and, telling the population it is a deadly sickness, kills any who show the signs of change; John and others aboard the ship were escaping from their homeworld when attacked. John then becomes the first to complete the transformation, becoming invulnerable. John offers to help Sunad make this transformation as well, but Sunad still refuses. John sends Sunad back to his own ship, warning him that their government can no longer keep their people in ignorance. The Zalkonian ship then leaves the area. John bids the crew good-bye, transforms into energy and departs the ship. While it's not known where John went, the implication is that John left for his homeworld so that other Zalkonians would have the chance to evolve and join him. Notes *\\"Transfigurations\\" was one of a long line of Star Trek episodes dealing with the effects of accelerated humanoid evolution. In several science fiction realms, including Star Trek, Doctor Who, Stargate SG-1, and Babylon 5, the highest evolutionary form is suggested to be an intelligence no longer bound by physical form, but instead constituted as pure energy. In several of these contexts, the highly evolved beings are gifted with extraordinary healing powers. This concept was first explored in the TOS episode Charlie X, but it was given more rhetorical force in Errand of Mercy. Releases The episode was released with Star Trek: The Next Generation season three DVD box set, released in the United States on September 3, 2002.

One or more explosive charges embedded within the bolt are typically activated by an electric current, and the charge breaks the bolt into two or more pieces. The bolt is typically scored around its circumference at the point(s) where the severance should occur.AMCP 706-179 pg 108 Such bolts are often used in space applications to ensure separation between rocket stages, because they are lighter and much more reliable than mechanical latches. For safety and reliability, exploding bridgewire detonators and slapper detonators are often used in aerospace technology instead of classical blasting caps. More recent developments have used pulsed laser diodes to detonate initiators through fiber-optic cables, which subsequently fire the main charge. Gas generators are similar to pyrotechnic fasteners. They are used to generate large amounts of gas, as for turbopumps, to inflate balloons, especially airbags, to eject parachutes and similar applications. Compositions used Various pyrotechnic compositions can be used, depending on the desired burn rate and required amount of energy and volume of gas produced. Some materials, such as RDX, sublime in vacuum, which limits their usefulness in aerospace applications. Composition with the character of bipropellants and flash powders are often used. =Standard pyrotechnic mixtures used by NASA= * Manganese / barium chromate / lead chromate: Time-delay mix, used for sequencing.

Combat Engineers provide mobility by bridging gaps and clearing minefields to facilitate speedy advance of troops into enemy territory, and counter-mobility by constructing obstacles such as anti-tank ditches to impede the enemy's movement. The Combat Engineers also construct trenches, drainage systems and other related infrastructure to enhance the survivability of troops during operations. History When the Singapore Armed Forces Training Institute (SAFTI) was set up in 1967 as the first military training institute to train officers and non-commissioned officers (NCOs, now known as Specialists), an Engineer Training Wing was incorporated into the plan. Two young officers, 2LT Gurcharan Singh and 2LT Chng Teow Hua, were selected to attend a basic engineer officer's course in Fort Belvoir, Virginia, United States. Upon completion of their course, these two officers, with the Commanding Officer, MAJ George Mitchell, conducted the first Engineer Commanders' Course from April to August 1968. The graduate officers and NCOs from the course formed the nucleus of the SCE.Ministry of Defence (Singapore), 1977 – Singapore Combat Engineers, History Snippets, Vol 8 Issue 1. As its role became more defined and her responsibilities expanded, the Engineer Wing was renamed to School of Field Engineers and moved from SAFTI (now Pasir Laba Camp) to new premises on Pulau Blakang Mati (now Sentosa) in the same year and subsequently branched out to other camps such as Gillman Camp and Loyang Camp (both now defunct). In April 1970, the Engineer Headquarters (EHQ) was established with MAJ Mitchell as the Senior Engineer Officer. The EHQ was renamed HQ Singapore Combat Engineer in 1974 and the commander's designation was changed to Chief Engineer Officer. Motto The Formation's motto, \\"Advance and Overcome\\" is derived from the Combat Engineers' fundamental role in providing mobility for advancing troops by overcoming all obstacles. The Combat Engineers believe they are advancing in terms of technology and techniques, overcoming adversities along the way – all part of their efforts to better fulfill missions of providing mobility, counter-mobility and ensuring survivability for the Army. Insignia The gold colour stands for the sterling qualities of the Combat Engineers – their steadfast spirit and durable nature. The black is for their ability to provide continuous support throughout hours of darkness. The castle is a symbol of the construction power of the Combat Engineers as seen in the bridges, fortifications, roads and obstacles often built by them. The interlocking bricks show the strength, endurance and high degree of teamwork required to accomplish engineer tasks. The bayonet represents the offensive spirit of the Engineers in piercing the enemy defences, while the twin bolts of lightning stand for the destructive demolition power of the Combat Engineers. Headquarters * Jurong Camp I - 30SCE * Nee Soon Camp - HQ SCE, ETI, CETC, 36SCE, 39SCE & HQ CBRE DG * Seletar Camp - HQ ARMCEG, 35SCE * Sungei Gedong Camp - 38 SCE Combat Engineers Colours On 22 January 1977, the first Combat Engineers Colours were presented to the Combat Engineers formation by the then President Benjamin Henry Sheares at Jurong Town Stadium. The presentation of Colours signifies esprit de corps, pride and identity. \\"The brown base colour represented the harsh terrain that Engineers must always advance through and overcome. The sword, wings and anchor depicted the support given to the land, airborne and amphibious forces while the laurel and words formed a golden circle representing unity.\\" It was replaced with a different design in October 1991. Structure The Combat Engineers formation consists of two headquarters, a training institute, five active battalions, and ten reservist battalions. Each brigade of the army has an organic company of field engineers, deployed at the discretion of the brigade commander, while each infantry battalion has an organic platoon of pioneers to support battalion movement. Unlike the usual infantry sections of seven men, a field engineer section consists of six men. There are two specialists in a section, the section commander and the section 2IC. =Headquarters Singapore Combat Engineers (HQ SCE)= Specialist HQ to the SAF on all matters pertaining to Combat Engineer Operations. Responsible for developing core engineer capabilities in terms of Mobility, Countermobility & Survivability. =Engineer Training Institute (ETI)= The Engineer Training Institute is the combination of three former Combat Engineer training schools, namely School of Combat Engineers (SOCE), Division Engineer Training Centre (DETC) and Armoured Engineer Training Centre (AETC). AETC was removed from ETI as of 1997 and re-established as an active unit, now officially known as the 38th Battalion, Singapore Combat Engineers (38SCE). ETI currently comprises Engineer Commander Training School (ECTS), Engineer Vocational Training School (EVTS), Division Engineer Training Centre (DETC) and Engineer Staff Training Centre (ESTC). The motto for ETI is Seek. Strive. Excel.. =30th Battalion, Singapore Combat Engineers (30SCE)= Originally formed as the 30th Combat Engineer Battalion (30 CEB) on 1 November 1968, the 30th Battalion, Singapore Combat Engineers (30SCE) provides the combat engineering capability of the 3rd Singapore Division, as well as Field and Plant Engineer support to the divisions and brigades of the Singapore Army. Typical Field Engineer tasks include demolition, fortification and the building of wire obstacles and minefields, while Plant Engineers operate heavy construction machinery. The battalion consists of three field companies and a Mechanized Equipment Company, and is responsible for the clearing of obstacles in the paths of advancing forces, the opening of main and alternate supply routes, and ensuring the mobility of the army's manoeuvre elements (i.e. armour and infantry forces). They also construct obstacles to deny movement to the enemy during retrograde operations and field fortifications for the protection of friendly forces. In the past, many Field Engineers suffered backbone problems due to the need to carry heavy equipment. Although the use of machinery has alleviated this problem, Field Engineers are nevertheless still required to bear a substantial load during operations. Field Engineers employ the Medium Girder Bridge, introduced to the Singapore Combat Engineers in 1975. A field engineer company of around 100 men would take seven hours to construct a bridge spanning more than 50 metres. It was eventually replaced by the Foldable Longspan Bridge (FLB) in 2001, where 12 men require three hours to construct a 46-metre span of bridge. Also used is the Cobra Projection Line Charge (PLC), a man-packed portable, rocket propelled minefield lane clearing charge used to clear infantry lanes through minefields. Plant Engineers are known to operate commercial construction equipment such as excavators, shovels, bulldozers and cranes. The battalion's motto is Overcome With Speed, Fortify With Strength, and its mascot is the polar bear. =Army Combat Engineer Group (ARMCEG)= The Army Combat Engineer Group (ARMCEG) was formed on 31 March 1993, as an operational command for bridging engineers in the SAF. It ensures that the SAF is equipped with the necessary mobility and counter-mobility capabilities so that troops are able to remain mobile and overcome obstacles in their missions. 35th Battalion, Singapore Combat Engineers (35SCE) 35SCE is the battalion specialised in military bridging. Consisting of three companies, the battalion provides the transportation means in the form of float bridges, rafts and assault boats for the projection of combat troops and vehicles across rivers and water obstacles to facilitate troop movement. Established in 1969, the 35th Battalion Singapore Combat Engineers was first called 35 CEB, based at Loyang Camp with ten officers and 30 NCOs. In 1971, the battalion relocated to its current base at Seletar Camp. The battalion is known to use a variety of bridging equipment. One company is known to be a training company while the other is an operational company, with operational status rotating with each intake. Each company is split into three platoons, namely two bridging platoons (Alpha and Bravo) and one watercraft platoon. Each bridging platoon operates 4 M3G Float Bridges which each require an operating crew of 4 men (2 sergeants and 2 Pioneer (military)). Each raft consists of two rigs, which form a Class 60 raft or a float bridge when coupled together further. The M3G Float Bridges also require substantial bank preparation prior to breaching in. In addition, the battalion houses a Boat company that comprises 4 platoons. The company specialises in rapid deployment and projection of combat troops across water bodies and coastal hook operations; which is an offensive manoeuvre executed by forces embarked in surface water craft using the coastal sea or river as an axis of movement, outflanking the enemy to accomplish the assigned tactical mission. It operates with 2 different open-top launch boats namely, the Assault Boat and GSB (General Support Boat). Their motto is \\"ALWAYS DELIVER\\", achieving mission critical success regardless of time, terrain, tide or weather. Lastly, there is a Combat Support company with a Singapore Signals platoon, a Surveillance platoon and a Plant (Heavy equipment) platoon. It is tasked with supporting the overall operations of the bridging battalion. In January 2005, 35SCE was deployed to Meulaboh as part of Operation Flying Eagle, Singapore's response to the 2004 Indian Ocean earthquake and tsunami. A 45-man combat engineering team was sent ashore to prepare landing points for supplies and equipment to be offloaded from the three Endurance class landing platform dock ships of the Republic of Singapore Navy anchored off Meulaboh. The engineers also assisted in the clearing of debris and roads and the creation of the helicopter landing points. The mascot of 35SCE is the crocodile, and its motto is Power Projection. 38th Battalion, Singapore Combat Engineers (SCE) The unit was renamed to 38 SCE on 29 April 2009 following its reprofiling as an active Aoud Engineer unit. The battalion'sotto is Steadfast and Gallant, with the African Elephant as its mascot. The Battalion employs the Leopard 2 Vehicle Launched Bridge, Bionix Vehicle Launched Bridge, Trailblazer, Broncos ATTC, M113 Land Assault Mine Breaching Equipment, FV180 Combat Engineer Tractor, M728 Combat Engineer Vehicle =Chemical, Biological, Radiological and Explosives Defence Group (CBRE DG)= The Chemical, Biological, Radiological and Explosives Defence Group (CBRE DG) was established in October 2002 with the integration of the operations and training of CBRD and EOD under a unified command. The CBRE DG manages all issues concerning counter-terrorist CBRE development. Since its inception, CBRE DG has been an integral part of the SAF's ongoing effort in the build-up of a comprehensive counter-terrorism capability against conventional and non-conventional threats, and conducts Preventive and Response CBRE operations in conjunction with the Home Team agencies on both the home and international fronts. On 4 April 2019, CBRE DG bid farewell to Seletar Camp and moved to its new home with 36 SCE and 39 SCE within the CBRE Cluster in Nee Soon Camp. The CBRE DG comprises the 36th and 39th Battalions, Singapore Combat Engineers, and the Medical Response Force (MRF) from the SAF Medical Corps, which provides on-scene medical treatment for casualties of chemical and biological agents. Its motto is Prepared and Vigilant. 36th Battalion, Singapore Combat Engineers (36SCE) Formed in 1969 as the Bomb Disposal Unit (BDU), the 36th Battalion, Singapore Combat Engineers is the Explosive Ordnance Disposal (EOD) Unit of the Singapore Armed Forces, specialising in defusing explosive devices. In peacetime, 36SCE handles security sweeps, attends to discovered old war relics and Improvised explosive devices. In 1978, 36 SCE sent a team to Bangladesh to aid in the clearing of a 500 lb aerial bomb. On 4 April 2019, 36 SCE bid farewell to Seletar Camp and moved to its new home with 39 SCE and CBRE DG within the CBRE Cluster in Nee Soon Camp. Its motto is Towards Perfection. Its mascot is the German Shepherd Dog. 39th Battalion, Singapore Combat Engineers (39SCE) The 39th Battalion, Singapore Combat Engineers, is the chemical, biological and radiological defence (CBRD) unit of the Singapore Armed Forces, formed to improve the survivability of troops in a chemical warfare environments. It decontaminates incident sites that contain chemical or biological hazards and provides a sustained, multi-incident response capability. 39SCE also works closely with the Singapore Civil Defence Force (SCDF) in the event of a chemical attack. The Gulf War highlighted the increased threat of chemical weapons, prompting the SAF to begin Individual Chemical Defence familiarisation training for its servicemen in 1991. In response, 39SCE was raised on 1 December 1993 as a company strength unit at Seletar East Camp to develop a chemical defence capability, and to conduct training and experimentation in the areas of chemical protection, detection and decontamination. By 1996, the SAF had developed a limited chemical response capability, which it fielded for the first time during the World Trade Organization Conference held in Singapore. Following the September 11 attacks, the Singapore Combat Engineer's EOD and CBRD battalions have worked with Home Affairs agencies to provide security coverage for significant international events. On 4 April 2019, 39 SCE bid farewell to Seletar Camp and moved to its new home with 36 SCE and CBRE DG within the CBRE Cluster in Nee Soon Camp. Its motto is Protect & Preserve. Its mascot is the mongoose.

The park is on a giant block of rock which was dropped along a fault that extends northwesterly across Pope County. The park is about west of Golconda on Illinois Route 146 near its junction with Illinois Route 145. The first land acquisition was in 1946.  History  The area around the park was occupied by various tribes of Algonquins who, after the Shawnee had been driven from Tennessee, had settled near the mouth of the Wabash River. Dixon Springs was one of their favorite camping grounds and was called \\"Kitchemuske- nee-be\\" for the Great Medicine Waters. One of the better known Indian trails, which the early French called the \\"Grand Trace,\\" passed to the west of the park and south to Fort Massac, then branched out into lesser trails.

This section of the state was part of an Indian reservation occupied for a time by about 6,000 Native Americans. Like the buffalo, most of the Indians were gone by the early 1830s. Dixon Springs takes its name from William Dixon, one of the first white settlers to build a home in this section, who obtained a school land warrant in 1848 from Governor Augustus C. French. His cabin was a landmark for many years, as was an old log church on the adjoining knoll. A small community grew up at Dixon Springs with a general store, post office, blacksmith shop, grist mill, and several churches. Dixon Springs became a 19th-century health spa which attracted hundreds to the seven springs of mineral-enriched water. A bathhouse provided mineral or soft water baths, hot or cold, available at any time. The natural environment of the area and its stone formations helped to give the park valley a more equable temperature in the summer than most of southern Illinois. This made the resort so popular that people came by steamboat excursions from as far away as Paducah, Kentucky, Evansville, Indiana, and Cairo to Golconda. They then traveled by train to within a couple of miles of the park.

They are currently members of the and play at Nyetimber Lane. History The club was formed in 1903, starting in the Bognor & Chichester Football league, and then joining the West Sussex league. The club at the end of the 1965–66 season became champions of the West Sussex league Premier Division for the first time and repeated this success two more times in the 1968–69 and 1969–70 seasons. As well as the league success the club also achieved two Sussex Intermediate Cup wins, in the 1966–67 and 1968–69 season. After achieving success in the West Sussex league the club joined Division Two of the Sussex County League for the 1970–71 campaign, finishing third in their first three seasons. In the 1972–73 season the club played their first ever FA Cup game drawing 0–0 with Chichester City, before losing 2–1 in the replay. In 1978–79 Pagham finished as champions of Division Two, winning promotion to the top division. The club finished fourth the following season, behind champions Chichester City, but lifted the title in 1980–81 – three points clear of runners-up Peacehaven & Telscombe, who went on to win the next two titles. Just three years later however, Pagham were relegated. Two third placings followed before the Division Two championship was lifted for the second time in 1986–87. Better was to follow over the next two seasons, with successive Division One titles, as well as the League Challenge Cup in 1988–89. The club firmly established itself as a Division One club subsequently, without reaching the heights of the late 1980s – the best season being 1992–93, when Pagham finished as runners-up to Peacehaven. 2003–04 however, saw the club finish in the bottom three, with only the earlier liquidation of St. Leonards sparing them the drop into Division Two. There was no escape in 2004–05 however, and a similarly wretched campaign saw the Lions drop back down into Division Two. In what could be viewed as a season of consolidation after a couple of poor years, 2005–06 saw the Lions only able to manage 13th place but 2006–07 saw them comfortably return to the top flight as champions, ten points clear of runners-up St. Francis Rangers. Ground Pagham Play their home games at Nyetimber Lane, Pagham, PO21 3JY. Before moving to Nyetimber lane the club spent their first 47 years of existence playing on various farmers’ fields until they moved onto a field adjoining the cricket club in Nyetimber Lane in 1950. A small wooded shed was provided by a local farmer which served as a changing room until the club applied to enter the County League in 1970. Originally there was a cricket-type pavilion erected, alongside the current breeze block stand which at the time had no seats. The pavilion and an old wooden building that served as a bar were eventually replaced by the current clubhouse, with dressing rooms behind.

The dam joins Cedar County, Nebraska with Yankton County, South Dakota a distance of 811.1 river miles (1,305 km) upstream of St. Louis, Missouri, where the river joins the Mississippi River. The dam and hydroelectric power plant were constructed as the Gavins Point Project from 1952 to 1957 by the United States Army Corps of Engineers as part of the Pick-Sloan Plan. The dam is located approximately 4 miles (6.4 km) west or upstream of Yankton, South Dakota. History and background Tom Brokaw greeting the 20,000th visitor to the dam in 1958. Brokaw was once a tour guide at the dam. Gavins Point Dam was constructed as a part of the Pick–Sloan Missouri Basin Program, authorized by the Flood Control Act of 1944 by Congress. The dam is named after Gavins Point, a bluff along the northern bank of the Missouri River named for an early settler, now within the western end of Lewis & Clark Recreation Area, which was to be the original location of construction of the dam. The location was moved and construction began further downstream along Calumet Bluff because this location offered a shorter span distance and less fill material needed for dam construction, although the project kept the original name. The dam operations work in conjunction with the other Pick-Sloan Program Dams to assist with conservation, control, and use of water resources in the Missouri River Basin. The intended beneficial uses of these water resources include flood control, aids to navigation, irrigation, supplemental water supply, power generation, municipal and industrial water supplies, stream-pollution abatement, Sediment control, preservation and enhancement of fish and wildlife, and creation of recreation opportunities. Gavins Point is the most downstream dam on the Missouri River at river mile 811.1 (river miles upstream of St. Louis where the river joins the Mississippi River) . The next dam upstream is Fort Randall Dam.http://www.nwo.usace.army.mil/Missions/Dam-and-Lake-Projects/Missouri- River-Dams/Gavins-Point/ =2011 Missouri River Flood= The dam releasing a record of water on June 14, 2011 as a result of the 2011 Missouri River Floods. The release was more than twice the previous record set in 1997.http://www.columbiamissourian.com/stories/2011/06/01/record- precipitation-reservoir-releases-cause-missouri-river-flooding/ During the 2011 Missouri River Flood, the dam released a record water flow of 160,200 cfs, the previous record was 70,000 cfs in 1997. During the 2011 flood, the dam was damaged by debris and a significant portion of rocks were dislodged from its upstream side. The U.S. Army Corps of Engineers soon began repairs to the dam and its spillway gates. Pressure sensors were also installed in concrete portion of the dam. Hydroelectric Power Generation The dam has a hydroelectric power plant with three generators, each having a nameplate capacity of 44,099 kW, for a total of 132.297 MW. The hydroelectric power plant provides enough electricity to supply 68,000 homes. Power generated is sold through the Western Area Power Administration. Reservoir See main article: Lewis and Clark Lake Aerial photo of Gavins Point Dam and Lewis and Clark Lake, looking north. Gavins Point Dam creates Lewis and Clark Lake, a popular regional tourist destination for water-based recreational opportunities including boating and fishing, along with camping, hiking, and hunting opportunities managed by the State of South Dakota, State of Nebraska, and the U.S. Army Corps of Engineers (USACE). The lake is significantly impacted by sedimentation and siltation issues, diminishing the overall water surface area, water storage capacity, and recreational opportunities. Sediment carried by the Missouri River and Niobrara River is slowed and trapped within the reservoir due to the dam impounding and thus stopping the natural river flow. Studies show approximately 5.1 million tons of sediment are deposited in the lake each year, which contributes to the lake's increasing size of delta area on the western portions of the lake. Approximately 60% of the sediment comes from the Nebraska Sandhills via the Niobrara River. As of 2016, approximately 30% of the lake's overall surface area has diminished due to sedimentation deposits, and some figures project by 2045 approximately 50% of the lake will be diminished due to sedimentation deposits. Presently, there is no plan or solution to remove or slow the progression of the siltation within the lake.http://msaconline.com/ See also *Lewis and Clark Lake *Pick-Sloan Plan *List of crossings of the Missouri River *List of dams in the Missouri River watershed *Water Resources Development Act References  External links  *U.S. Army Corps of Engineers, Omaha District - Gavins Point Project (Official Site) *Missouri River Water Management Division - U.S. Army Corps of Engineers *Missouri River Basin Daily Bulletin - USACE Category:Buildings and structures in Cedar County, Nebraska Category:Dams in Nebraska Category:Dams in South Dakota Category:Hydroelectric power plants in Nebraska Category:Hydroelectric power plants in South Dakota Category:Dams on the Missouri River Category:Buildings and structures in Yankton County, South Dakota Category:United States Army Corps of Engineers dams Category:Dams completed in 1957 Category:Energy infrastructure completed in 1957 Category:Earth-filled dams Category:United States Army Corps of Engineers Category:Energy infrastructure in Nebraska ","title":"Gavins Point Dam"},{"id":"3881629","text":"State Route 14 (SR 14) is a state highway that travels southwest-to-northeast through portions of Troup, Coweta, and Fulton counties in the west-central and north-central parts of the U.S. state of Georgia. The highway connects the Alabama state line in West Point to Downtown Atlanta, via LaGrange, Fairburn, College Park, and East Point. Except for the northernmost segment, it is entirely concurrent with U.S. Route 29 (US 29). Route description SR 14 starts at its southern terminus just west of the Chattahoochee River in West Point in Troup County, and travels northeast through LaGrange, paralleling I-85 to the west, and is concurrent with US 29 for almost its entire length, with the exception of a brief distance at its northern terminus. US 29/SR 14 turns slightly north after leaving LaGrange and travels through Hogansville, then turns northeast again, traveling through Grantville, before crossing I-85 and traveling parallel to the interstate on its east side through portions of Coweta County. The route then travels into Moreland, where it turns slightly northwest, crosses I-85 once more, and heads into Newnan. Turning northeast once more, the route crosses into Fulton County and heads through Palmetto, Fairburn, and Union City, before crossing I-285 west of Hartsfield–Jackson Atlanta International Airport. SR 14 then continues through East Point, crosses I-20, and arrives at its northern terminus at SR 154 and Ted Turner Drive NW in downtown Atlanta. There following portions of SR 14 are part of the National Highway System, a system of routes determined to be the most important for the nation's economy, mobility, and defense: * The concurrency with US 27/SR 1 in LaGrange * From the I-85 interchange south of East Newnan to the intersection with SR 34 Byp. in Newnan * From SR 74 in Fairburn to the US 29 Alt./SR 14 Alt. in Red Oak History SR 14 was established at least as early as 1919 on its current path, from West Point to Atlanta. Between September 1921 and October 1926, US 29 was designated on SR 14's entire length. Three segments of the highway had a completed hard surface: a portion in the east-northeast part of West Point, from south-southwest of LaGrange to just southwest of the Troup–Meriwether–Coweta county tripoint, and from Moreland to Atlanta. By October 1929, the entire highway had a completed hard surface. Major intersections Special routes =LaGrange alternate route= State Route 14 Alternate (SR 14 Alt.) was an alternate route of SR 14 that existed entirely within the city limits of LaGrange. Between June 1963 and the beginning of 1966, it was established from US 29/SR 14/SR 109 (Broad Street) east past SR 219 to US 27/SR 1/SR 219 (Hamilton Road; this intersection also served as the western terminus of SR 720) and north on them to US 29/SR 14/SR 219 (Broad Street; this intersection also served as the southern terminus of US 29 Bus./SR 14 Conn. Between the beginning of 1974 and the beginning of 1977, the path of US 29/SR 14/SR 109 in the western part of the city was shifted southward, replacing the path of SR 14 Alt. =LaGrange connector route (1965–1976)= State Route 14 Connector (SR 14 Conn.) was a connector route of SR 14 that existed entirely within the city limits of LaGrange. Between June 1963 and the beginning of 1966, it was established, concurrent with US 29 Bus., starting at an intersection with US 27/SR 1/SR 14 Alt./SR 219 (Hamilton Road/Franklin Road) and US 29/SR 14/SR 109 (Broad Street/Franklin Road). US 29 Bus./SR 14 Conn. traveled east-northeast on Greenville Street, concurrent with SR 109\\\\. Then, they split off of SR 109 and curved to the north-northeast to a second intersection with US 29/SR 14 (Commerce Avenue/Hogansville Road). Between the beginning of 1974 and the beginning of 1977, both US 29 Bus. and SR 14 Conn. were decommissioned. =LaGrange connector route= State Route 14 Connector (SR 14 Conn.) is a connector route of SR 14 that exists entirely within the city limits of LaGrange. It is known as Broad Street from its western terminus to West LaFayette Square/Church Street. It is known as North LaFayette Square from there to Main Street. It is known as Greenville Street from that point to its eastern terminus. The western end of the highway serves as the northern and western edge of LaGrange College. Between Waverly Way and Gordon Street, it is also the centerpiece of the Broad Street Historic District, and has a concurrency with SR 219 from Greenwood Street to Morgan Street (US 27/US 29/SR 1/SR 14). The roadway that would eventually become SR 14 Conn. was established at least as early as 1919 as part of US 29/SR 14. Between September 1921 and October 1926, this segment had a \\"completed hard surface\\". In 1937, SR 109 was placed on a concurrency with US 29/SR 14. In 1994, US 29/SR 14/SR 109 was shifted southward, onto Vernon Street. The former path was redesignated as SR 14 Conn. =LaGrange spur route= State Route 14 Spur (SR 14 Spur) is a spur route of SR 14 in the southeastern part of LaGrange, in Troup County. It connects SR 219 in the southern part of the city with US 29/SR 14 northeast of the city. It begins at an intersection with SR 219 (Whitesville Road). It curves to a northeasterly direction and intersects US 27/SR 1 (Hamilton Road). Then, it reaches SR 109 (Lafayette Parkway) just over before meeting its northern terminus, an intersection with US 29/SR 14 (Hogansville Road). SR 14 Spur is not part of the National Highway System, a system of roadways important to the nation's economy, defense, and mobility. In 1971, SR 14 Spur was established on its current path. =Palmetto–Red Oak alternate route= State Route 14 Alternate (SR 14 Alt.) is a alternate route of SR 14 that exists entirely within the southern and southeastern parts of Fulton County. It connects Palmetto with Red Oak, located southwest of Atlanta. It is concurrent with US 29 Alt. for its entire length. It begins at an intersection with US 29/SR 14 (Main Street) in Palmetto. This intersection marks the northern end of US 29/SR 14's concurrency with SR 154, with which US 29 Alt./SR 14 Alt. begins concurrent. The three highways travel north on a nearly due-north direction, until they reach SR 70 (South Fulton Parkway). There, the alternate routes turn to the right, toward Atlanta. The concurrency heads northeast, passing Cedar Grove Lake, and intersects SR 92 (Campbellton–Fairburn Road). They pass South Wind Golf Course and curve to a nearly due-east direction. In Red Oak, they have an interchange with US 29/SR 14 (Roosevelt Highway). Here, both US 29 Alternate/SR 14 Alternate meet their northern terminus, and the roadway continues as SR 14 Conn. All of SR 14 Alt., from the eastern end of the SR 154 concurrency to its eastern terminus, is included as part of the National Highway System, a system of routes determined to be the most important for the nation's economy, mobility, and defense. The roadway that would eventually become SR 14 Alt. was proposed in 1992 from SR 154 north-northwest of Palmetto to SR 14 Spur west of Red Oak. The next year, this road was completed. It wasn't until 2007 that US 29 Alt./SR 14 Alt. was designated on its entire current path. =Red Oak spur route= State Route 14 Spur (SR 14 Spur) was a spur route of SR 14 that existed in Red Oak. Between June 1960 and June 1963, it was established from US 29/SR 14 southwest of Red Oak north-northeast and east-southeast to another intersection with US 29/SR 14\\\\. Then, it headed in an easterly direction to Interstate 85 (I-85) and north-northwest to US 29/SR 14 east of Red Oak. In 2007, it was redesignated as SR 14 Connector. =Red Oak–College Park connector route= State Route 14 Connector (SR 14 Conn.) is a connector route of SR 14 in southern Fulton County. Its western terminus is at an interchange with US 29/SR 14 (Roosevelt Highway) in Red Oak, where the roadway continues as US 29 Alt./SR 14 Alt. (South Fulton Parkway), it becomes a state maintained freeway. A short distance later, it enters College Park. At the southwest interchange of I-85 and I-285, it becomes their collector/distributor roads, which continue east through the SR 279 interchange to end at the northeast split of I-85/285. All of SR 14 Spur is included as part of the National Highway System, a system of roadways important to the nation's economy, defense, and mobility. The roadway that would eventually become SR 14 Conn. was established between June 1960 and June 1963, as SR 14 Spur from US 29/SR 14 southwest of Red Oak north-northeast and east-southeast to another intersection with US 29/SR 14\\\\. It then traveled easterly to I-85 and then north-northwest to US 29/SR 14 east of Red Oak. In 1993, the western terminus was truncated to the middle junction with US 29/SR 14. In 2007, it was redesignated as SR 14 Conn.

He wrote an eight-volume work entitled Blackford's Reports recording all the early decisions of the court. The books became a staple legal source among Indiana's lawyers and received national and international acclaim for its style, accuracy, quality, and concision in dealing with common law. As a jurist, Blackford was the most influential ever to serve on Indiana's courts, according to former Chief Justice of Indiana Randall Shepard. He was nicknamed the \\"Indiana Blackstone\\" because of a comment made by Washington Irving regarding the popularity of Blackford's books. During his lifetime he was nationally renowned as one of the most prominent jurists in the United States. After graduating from Princeton University, Blackford moved to the Indiana Territory to practice law in 1812. After holding several civil service positions, he was appointed a circuit court judge but resigned just before the territorial government was dissolved in 1816. Elected as a representative to the first session of the Indiana General Assembly, he was chosen to serve as the first Speaker of the Indiana House of Representatives. Following the death of Indiana Chief Justice John Johnson in 1817, Blackford was appointed as his replacement by Governor of Indiana Jonathan Jennings. Blackford's early important cases included Polly v. Lasselle, the decision in that case freed all slaves in Indiana. Nominated without his knowledge or permission, in 1825 he was the Whig candidate for Governor of Indiana, but was defeated in the election because of his refusal to campaign publicly. Again nominated without his knowledge to become a United States Senator, he lost the election in the Indiana General Assembly by only one vote. Blackford was beset by a number of personal tragedies during the 1820s. Following the death of his wife in childbirth, his young son a few years later, then his mother, and narrowly escaping death himself, he became emotionally distraught. He began to live a reclusive lifestyle in a one-room apartment in the Indiana Governor's Mansion, where he remained for over twenty years. There he spent his time with only the companionship of his servant. He left for occasional meals, to attend court sessions, and rarely for business and church, but otherwise remained locked away. It was during his solitude that he began writing the reports for which he became renowned. He was reappointed to his seat on the Supreme Court four times, serving until the adoption of the 1851 Constitution of Indiana, which made his position subject to election rather than appointment. Defeated for the Whig party nomination to run for his office, he left the court in 1852. He was defeated again in the 1853 election to become Supreme Court Reporter, which led him to seek a position on the federal courts after briefly attempting to practice law. Appointed by President Franklin Pierce, he served as a Judge of the newly created Court of Claims dealing with financial claims against the federal government from 1855 until his death. During his lifetime Blackford accumulated a small fortune through the sale of his reports which was left to his only living relative, his half-sister Charlotte Teresa Coons. Early life =Family and background= Isaac Blackford was born on November 6, 1786, in Bound Brook, Somerset County, New Jersey, the son of Joseph and Mary Straats Blackford. Joseph was a merchant, and Mary was the daughter of a farmer. She had been a nurse during the American Revolutionary War and aided American soldiers as a during the battles of Trenton and Princeton, and continued to care for them when smallpox broke out among the army during the winter of 1780–1781. Both of Blackford's parents were Presbyterian, and he remained a member of the church his entire life.Thornton, p. 3Vile, p. 84 Blackford received a basic education, learning to read and write, in local public schools.Thornton, p. 1 His father died on May 22, 1800, leaving a modest estate valued at $7,220.99 ($ in 2018 chained dollars) to his mother, and directing that half of the estate should be given to Blackford for education and as an inheritance, provided he remained obedient unto her until he reached adulthood. Mary remarried in 1801 to Thomas Coon and the couple had a child, Charlotte Teressa, on August 3, 1802. Blackford at first disliked his stepfather, but the two developed a close relationship as he grew older. The family continued to prosper, and when Blackford finally inherited his portion of his father's estate he received $5,550. On his stepfather's advice he invested the money by granting a mortgage to earn interest.Thornton, p. 2 Blackford was enrolled in Princeton University at age sixteen and graduated at the top of his class in 1806. On his enrollment forms he entered his middle name as Newton, but never again used the name during his life. Among his fifty-four classmates were John Williams Walker, James Iradell, John James Marshall, and Patrick Noble. Blackford became fluent in Greek and Latin and excelled in history. He also spent a considerable amount of time reading legal books on English common law. After college he studied law for a year in the office of Revolutionary War hero Colonel George MacDonald before moving on in 1810 to complete his legal studies in the office of New Jersey Supreme Court Justice Gabriel Ford in Morristown. He was admitted to the bar in New Jersey that same year. He took only one case of his own and realized he needed to join a law firm if he was going to be able to earn a living at his profession. He returned to his hometown and joined MacDonald's firm.Dunn, p. 335Thornton, p. 18Vile, p. 85 =Indiana Territory= In 1812 Blackford moved west. His reason for leaving New Jersey is unclear, as he had a potentially prosperous life in the east, his family was there, and the prospect of earning a living as a lawyer on the frontier was uncertain.Thornton, p. 19 Having spent most of his funds on education, Blackford could not to afford to take the stage coach and walked from New Jersey to the Allegany River where he traveled downriver by raft to Cincinnati, Ohio and then continued on foot to Dayton, Ohio. He lived only briefly in Dayton and continued further west, moving into the Indiana Territory and first living in Brookville. He carried with him letters of introduction to territorial Judge Isaac Dunn, a friend of George MacDonald. The letter helped him to quickly establish himself among the small legal community in the territory. Brookville was the administrative center of the eastern half of the territory, but Blackford had little chance of making a substantial income as a lawyer there, so he sought work in the civil service. He moved again to Salem where he was appointed by Governor William Henry Harrison to be clerk and recorder in the newly formed Washington County.Thornton, pp. 19–24 Blackford's income was still not enough for him to subsist on. In 1813, he traveled to the territorial capital, Vincennes. There he was admitted to the bar with the help of his friend John Test; he was only the thirtieth lawyer admitted to the bar in the territory. The same year he was elected principal clerk for the Indiana Territory House of Representatives. He also became a cashier at the Corydon branch Bank of Vincennes, the same town the capital was moved to at the end of 1813. He became aware of corruption at the bank which later folded in the Panic of 1819; numerous investors lost their money and the scandalous abuses were revealed to the public. The experience influenced him to mistrust banks throughout his life, and led him to refuse to put any money in banks.Thornton, p. 20 Governor Thomas Posey reorganized the territorial courts in 1813 creating three districts and appointing judges to preside in them. Judge Benjamin Parke was appointed to the 1st Circuit, but he resigned in 1814. Posey had become familiar with Blackford who as clerk of the House of Representatives was responsible for communications between Posey, who was residing in Jeffersonville, and the General Assembly, which was in Corydon. Posey appointed Blackford to succeed Parke as judge in the 1st Circuit Territorial Court. The first circuit at that time was the largest in the territory and consisted of the eight western counties of the territory. There were few roads in the region at the time, and Blackford rode cross-country between settlements to hold court. He made six circuit trips during his tenure and tried forty-nine cases, and dismissed a number of others.Thornton, pp. 21–22 When statehood was granted to Indiana on December 11, 1816, the territorial government was dissolved, including Blackford's position. He had moved to Vincennes during his term as judge to live centrally within his district. Upon leaving the bench, he was elected as a Democratic-Republican member to the first Indiana House of Representatives and served a one-year term from 1816 to 1817.Thornton, p. 26 In the House he was chosen Speaker, making him Indiana's first. Although he came from the western and pro-slavery area of the state, he was in party with the anti-slavery Jennings' faction of assembly.Thornton, p. 27 As there was only one political party in the state at the time, the factions of the state Democratic-Republican Party vied for power. There is no record of Blackford's specific impact on any legislation, although he would have been heavily involved in laying the foundation of the state government, the framework of which was created during the first session of the assembly. Senator James Noble later recorded that Blackford was a popular member of the body, and was supported in each of his proposals by the majority.Dunn, p. 336Thornton, p. 28 Chief Justice Seal of the Indiana Supreme Court In 1817, Blackford was appointed Chief Justice of the Indiana Supreme Court by Governor Jonathan Jennings to replace Chief Justice John Johnson who had died after less than a year on the bench, and before the court had issued its first decision. Jennings informed Blackford of his decision as the two walked arm-in-arm from Johnson's grave following his funeral service. Blackford at first refused, saying he was too young and inexperienced. However, there were less than seventy lawyers in the entire state at that time, the majority of which belonged to other factions of the party, or had not lived in the state long enough to qualify for the job. Jennings and Blackford were the only two members of the government who came from New Jersey, increasing Jennings' sentimental desire to see Blackford appointed. Despite Blackford's refusal, Jennings appointed him to the court and he was easily confirmed by the state senate to his first seven-year term.Thornton, p. 36Vile, p. 86 Blackford quickly earned a reputation for being fair and impartial and is regarded as one of the most influential and pivotal members in the court's history. According to Chief Justice Randall Shepherd, he was the most important justice to have ever served on the state courts and was responsible for laying the legal foundation of the state.Thornton, p. V During his time on the three member court he wrote the majority opinion on 845 of the nearly 2300 cases he presided over.Thornton, p. 39 That was more than twice as many decisions authored by any other justice in the court's history and remains a record. Seven other men served with him on the court, including James Scott, Jesse Holman, Stephen Stevens, John McKinney, Jeremiah Sullivan, Charles Dewey, Samuel Perkins, and Thomas Smith.Thornton, p. 82 As Chief Justice, he was responsible for overseeing many of the day-to-day functions of the court, and oversaw the court during its move from the capitol of Corydon to Indianapolis in 1825. In 1831, the General Assembly granted the court permission to hold sessions anywhere within Indianapolis that they should chose, due to crowding in the statehouse. Blackford petitioned to have a chamber made available in the Indiana Governor's Mansion which was at that time being used for office space. He oversaw a fourth move to the new Indiana Statehouse in 1839. The court remained there for the remainder of his time on the bench.Thornton, pp. 58–60 Among the many cases he presided over was the 1820 case of Polly v. Lasselle, in which he ruled to free all slaves in Indiana. Among his most important and impacting decisions was the case of State v. Tipton which severely limited the ability to appeal decisions to higher courts, but significantly decreased the Supreme Court's caseload. In Deming v. Bullit he ruled that parties could cancel contracts of sale even after payment was made, provided they refunded the fees. In Shanklin v. Cooper he ruled that contracts made in Indiana regarding assets outside of the state were still under Indiana's judicial jurisdiction, although he ruled to overturn his own precedent in the case of Hunt v. Standart.Thornton, p. 51 Because Indiana had only a very limited civil and criminal code during the nineteenth century, Blackford relied heavily on English common law treatises to base his own decisions on, including Coke's Reports and Blackstone's Commentaries. During his lifetime, he amassed a personal library with nearly 2,000 volumes of legal works.Vile, p. 87 =Personal tragedies= George MacDonald, under whom Blackford had studied law, left his law practice in the east and moved to the Indiana in 1818. Blackford began courting his daughter Caroline, who was fourteen years younger than himself. They were married on December 23, 1819, in Vincennes by Reverend Samuel T. Scott. Their brief marriage was strained because of the age difference. Caroline wished to entertain and enjoyed the high society that Blackford's position brought, while Blackford preferred to live reclusively. They had one son, George, born on May 3, 1821. Caroline died in childbirth, a shock from which Blackford never fully recovered and leading him to become very protective and invested in his son. Blackford wrote to his mother of his unhappiness in marriage, and, after his wife's death, he vowed to never marry again. Sketch of the Indiana Governor's Mansion where Blackford lived for over twenty years. Blackford's son became ill probably with malaria, the date and details of the sickness are unknown. Blackford took him to Lexington, Kentucky for medical treatment, but he died only a short time later.Funk, 140The year of George Blackford's death is uncertain as Blackford refused to speak about the incident with anyone. The boy died sometime before August 1827. The death was an emotional blow to Blackford. He returned to Vincennes where he arrived in the night and entered the home of his friend John Coburn. He lay on the floor and wept till morning. He then locked himself away for two weeks in a room in Coburn's home, never speaking and only coming out to receive a meal. As he recovered, he sold his Vincennes estate and invested the money in land.Thornton, p. 29 The General Assembly had granted boarding rooms in the Indiana Governor's Mansion for the Supreme Court Justices to use while in Indianapolis. Blackford left Vincennes and moved into his room in the mansion. He hired a servant, William Franklin, who was the child of emancipated slaves, to bring him meals and clean his room. Due in large part to his emotional distress, Blackford began a hermit's lifestyle that he continued for twenty years. Franklin became Blackford's closest friend and remained with him throughout his life.Franklin lived until 1888 and Blackford's biography by William Thornton was based in large part on his recounting of Blackford's life. (Thornton, p. 31)Thornton, p. 31 In 1827, Blackford's mother died on August 18. Blackford shut himself away for six months and even stopped attending court sessions. He obtained a lock of her hair and carried it with him for the remainder of his life. Shortly thereafter while returning to Indianapolis after attending business in Vincennes, he attempted to ford the swollen White River on his horse as he neared Martinsville. The river proved to be too swift and he and his horse were swept away. He was able to catch himself on an island, but was unable to escape it. He remained there for two days without food before he was discovered by a farmer to rescue him. He was taken to his apartment where he was nursed by Franklin until his health returned.Thornton, p. 32 =Blackford's Reports= Blackford's salary began at $600 annually, and the constitution prevented it from decreasing during his term.Thornton, p. 57 At the time his salary was enough to sustain only a meager lifestyle. He invested some of his savings in land speculation around the state and made a large profit from his initial investment. He used the money to buy three city blocks in Indianapolis shortly after the city was platted in 1824. On one block he had a four-story brick building constructed during the late 1820s and he rented office space for income. By the 1830s he no longer needed his judicial salary to live and left it in the state treasury to draw interest at 6%. By the time he left office, he was earning $1,500 annually, and in total earned an estimated $50,000, including interest, from his salary. ($ in 2018 chained dollars) He was reportedly very frugal with his money and amassed a small fortune during his lifetime.Thornton, p. 53 After his personal tragedies while he remaining locked in his room, Blackford began working on a book to report the important decisions of the Supreme Court and provide a legal source to the state lawyers and judges. He was meticulous and precise in his writing. His biographer attributed his ability to write concisely to the fact that he never practiced law extensively, and never developed the habit of writing lengthy arguments, but instead kept his thoughts clear and precise.Thornton, p. 61 Each volume he authored covered a decade of court decisions and were published four years after the decade was complete. So careful was Blackford in ensuring the quality and accuracy of the work, he regularly held up printing to make corrections found after a few volumes were printed, and after they were printed, if an error was reported, he would destroy the existing copies and have new ones made. He used his own savings to have the books published with the intention of selling them to lawyers in Indiana. The sale of the books brought Blackford a substantial income, and he earned between $1,500 and $2,000 annually on royalties.Thornton, p. 61–63 Blackford published the first of his eight volumes of Blackford's Reports in 1830. It was immediately in demand among the state's judicial establishment as there was at that time no other readily available source for Supreme Court decisions.Thornton, p. 65 The Indiana General Assembly later approved and funded the publishing of the two volume Indiana Reports, which was authored by the court reporter and reported the entirety of the decisions of the Supreme Court. Blackford's Reports still remained more popular because of their superior style and quality. His reports were noted by readers for their concision, accuracy, and diction. They soon became popular in other US states where common law was used. Within a decade his reports had spread to Europe. As Great Britain used common law, his reports were also published in Britain and Canada where they were used as a legal resource.Thornton, p. 66 Washington Irving, while at a post at the Court of St. James's, wrote to his superiors in Washington D.C. requesting information on Blackford and reported that Blackford's Reports were well known in Westminster and regularly used by the judiciary, and Irving compared him to the William Blackstone. The attribution stuck with Blackford, and earned him the nickname \\"Indiana Blackstone.\\" His reports by then had become a staple in law schools and a necessity in most law firms in the United States. Blackford's Reports were thorough and detailed thanks to Blackford's effort to keep them accurate. His reputation for accuracy became well known. On one occasion a lawyer arguing before the court seeking to delay a decision questioned Blackford on the spelling of the word \\"jenny\\", a female donkey, a word he knew would be in the report. Blackford responded with the spelling and lawyer again questioned him if he was certain that word was not spelled \\"jennie\\". Not wanting to be hasty and enter an incorrectly spelled word onto the record, Blackford delayed the decision for two days while experts were consulted as to the proper spelling. By the time the answer had come the court session had ended and decision was delayed for several months. Between the time the books were published, and until 1930, his reports in were cited over 4,000 times by Indiana courts, over 3,000 times other state courts in the United States, over 1,400 times by federal courts and the United States Supreme Court, more than 350 times in Canadian courts, and more than 75 in British courts.Thornton, p. 67 Additionally, his decisions were cited over 400 times from Indiana Reports. It is estimated that since 1930, his reports have been cited an additional 4,000 times in court decisions. The use of his reports in law schools became less common beginning in the early 1900s as many states' civil codes began to become more developed. His reports, however, remain a regularly used tool in states where common law in still widely used.Thornton, p. 68 =Electoral failures= In 1825 Blackford was nominated, without his knowledge, as the Whig candidate for governor of Indiana. Because of his position on the courts, he refused to campaign on his own behalf against his opponent. In the election he was defeated by James B. Ray with 13,140 votes to his 10,418.Thornton, p. 54 The same year, after his defeat, he was nominated for a United States Senate seat, again without his knowledge. He lost in the Indiana General Assembly by one vote and was defeated by former governor William Hendricks. Governor Ray reappointed Blackford as Chief Justice in 1826 in an attempt to win electoral support from the Whigs on a number of laws he was advocating passage of. Blackford was reappointed again in 1833 by Governor Noah Noble and in 1840 by Samuel Bigger who were both of same party as Blackford. Democratic Governor Whitcomb at first refused to reappoint Blackford because of his age in 1847. He nominated four different replacements for Blackford but the Indiana Senate refused to confirm them, forcing Whitcomb to give in and reappoint Blackford. Whitcomb likewise had refused to reappoint the other two members of the court, leaving Blackford as the only justice on the court for nearly a year while the governor wrangled with the General Assembly over the issue. In both 1826 and 1847, Blackford was the only member of the court to be reappointed, based largely on his popularity and the fame of his reports. His fellow court members had been ejected because of their age, or their slow pace in making decision. Blackford was a trustee for Indiana College (now Indiana University) from 1838 to 1841. During that time the college published his reports on their printing press. He continued serving on the Supreme Court until the new state Constitution of 1851 made the position of justice an elected office. He sought the nomination at the Whig convention to run to keep his seat, but his lack of political experience led to his defeat. In total he had been on the Supreme Court for over thirty-five years, seven and a half years longer than any other justice in state history. As late as 1930, he remained the longest serving jurist in any position in the United States.Thornton, p. IV Later years Blackford still desired to be associated with the court so he could write the court reports. He was successfully nominated to run for the position of court reporter on the Whig ticket in 1853, but was defeated in the election by future Vice President of the United States Thomas Hendricks. After being defeated in his second election attempt after leaving the court, he briefly returned to private life. He opened a law office and took on one case which he argued before Judge David Wallace. He stumbled in making his arguments as he was unaccustomed to speaking publicly and he lost the case. He found the change of position embarrassing and was occasionally offended by the public and the court system for not showing him what he considered due respect. After the loss of his case he closed his law office.Thornton, p. 73 Federal judicial service With the aid of his friends, he sought to return to the bench. He had already become nationally renowned for his reports, and his availability to become a federal judge was reported to President Franklin Pierce. Congress created the Court of Claims (later the United States Court of Claims) to sit in Washington, D.C. in 1855.Thornton, p. 74 Blackford was nominated by President Pierce, who remarked that there was no better qualified candidate in the nation, on March 3, 1855, to the Court of Claims, to a new seat authorized by 10 Stat. 612. He was confirmed by the United States Senate on March 3, 1855, and received his commission the same day. He served as Presiding Judge from 1858 to 1859. The business of the court focused on financial claims against the government and was created as an investigative and deliberative body to help the Congress determine the validity of the claims and to lighten their workload. Given the type of cases dealt with, the decisions of the court received little attention and were primarily advisory in nature, recommending that Congress pay or not pay on the various claims. His service terminated on December 31, 1859, due to his death in Washington, D.C.Thornton, p. 76 Death and legacy Blackford's remains were returned to Indiana where he lay in state in the chambers of the Indiana Senate in Indianapolis.Gugin and St. Clair, eds. (2010), p. 15 His bier was attended by thousands of citizens and numerous dignitaries. He was buried in Greenwood Cemetery on the edge of Indianapolis. In 1866 his remains were disinterred and were reburied at Crown Hill Cemetery, Indianapolis, Indiana. There a high marble monument was erected over his grave in his honor. His entire estate was left to his half-sister Charlotte Teresa Coons and was worth an estimated $250,000 ($ in 2018 chained dollars).Thornton, p. 79 Blackford County, Indiana was named in honor of Justice Blackford in 1838. During his lifetime he became renowned for Blackford's Reports and as the \\"Indiana Blackstone.\\" His reports remained in popular use many years after his death. Supreme Court librarian, circuit court judge, and historian William Wheeler Thornton states that after Blackford left the Indiana Supreme Court, and once the position was made elective, the prestige of the court that had been built up by Blackford was gradually lost as it became more political and less judicial. It was not until 1971 that the court position was again made appointive. Current Indiana Supreme Court Chief Justice Randall Shepard described Blackford as the \\"leading figure in shaping Indiana's judiciary.\\" Electoral history References Bibliography   * External links  Isaac Newton at Findagrave Category:Judges of the United States Court of Claims Category:1786 births Category:1859 deaths Category:Burials at Crown Hill Cemetery Category:Speakers of the Indiana House of Representatives Category:Indiana Whigs Category:19th-century American politicians Category:United States federal judges appointed by Franklin Pierce Category:19th-century American judges Category:Blackford County, Indiana Category:Indiana Territory officials Category:People from Bound Brook, New Jersey Category:Politicians from Indianapolis Category:Indiana lawyers Category:Indiana Democratic-Republicans Category:Chief Justices of the Indiana Supreme Court Category:United States federal judges admitted to the practice of law by reading law ","title":"Isaac Blackford"},{"id":"3881641","text":"Gemini may refer to: Space * Gemini (constellation), one of the constellations of the zodiac ** Gemini in Chinese astronomy * Project Gemini, the second U.S. crewed spaceflight program * Gemini Observatory, consisting of telescopes in the Northern and Southern Hemispheres * Gemini Planet Imager, an instrument for observing extrasolar planets Mythology * Gemini (astrology), an astrological sign * Gemini twins, in Greek mythology Arts and entertainment =Comics and literature= * Gemini (DC Comics), a fictional supervillain * Gemini (Marvel Comics), a fictional character * Gemini, a comic series created by Jay Faerber * Gemini Kanon, a fictional character in the manga Saint Seiya by Masami Kurumada * Gemini Saga, a fictional character in the manga Saint Seiya by Masami Kurumada * Gemini (magazine), a Norwegian periodical * Gemini Publications, an American magazine publisher * Gemini, a 2000 novel by Dorothy Dunnett * Gemini (Les Météores), a 1975 novel by Michel Tournier * Gemini: An Extended Autobiographical Statement on My First Twenty-five Years of Being a Black Poet, a 1971 publication by Nikki Giovanni =Film and theatre= * Gemini (1999 film) (Sôseiji), a Japanese horror film * Gemeni (film), a 2002 Telugu film also known as Gemini * Gemini (2002 film), a Tamil film starring Vikram and Kiran Rathod * Géminis, a 2005 Argentinian film * The Gemini (2016 film), a Burmese LGBT film * Gemini (2017 film), an American mystery thriller film * Gemini (play), by Albert Innaurato * Gemini Film Circuit, a film distribution and production studio unit in Chennai, India * Gemini Studios, a film production house in South India =Music= Performers * Gemini (musician) (born 1990), British electronic music producer and DJ * Gemini (Chinese band), a French-Chinese rock band * Gemini (Hungarian band), a Hungarian rock band established in 1965 * Gemini (Portuguese band), a 1970s band * Gemini (Swedish band), a brother- and-sister pop duo * Gemini (rapper), also known as \\"Big Geminii\\", American rapper * Demarco Castle, rapper/singer formerly known as \\"Gemini\\" and most recently \\"GemStones\\" * Jemini, British pop group from Liverpool Albums * Gemini (Alice Nine album), 2011 * Gemini (Brian McKnight album), 2005 * Gemini (El DeBarge album), 1989 * Gemini (Gemini album), 1985 * Gemini (Macklemore album), 2017 * Gemini (Noah Reid album), 2020 * Gemini (TQ album), 2003 * Gemini (Wild Nothing album), 2010 * Gemini: Good vs. Evil, by Krayzie Bone, 2005 * Gemini, by Adrien Gallo of BB Brunes, 2014 * Gemini, by Atrocity, 2000 * Gemini, by Einstürzende Neubauten, 2003 * Gemini, by Kasia Kowalska, 1994 * Gemini, by Lana Lane, 2006 * Gemini, by Sherina Munaf, 2009 * Gemini, by Yoon Mi-rae (recording as T), 2002 Songs * \\"Gemini\\" (Sponge Cola song), 2004 * \\"Gemini\\", by Alabama Shakes from Sound & Color * \\"Gemini\\", by The Alan Parsons Project from the album Eye in the Sky * \\"Gemini\\", by Anahí de Cárdenas from Who's That Girl?

They are currently members of the and play at Hill Park. History Saltdean United formed in 1966 by seven founding members who were inspired by the victorious England World Cup campaign. The club started life in the local Brighton Saturday League and gradually moved up their divisional structure over the years. Following the acquisition of their picturesque ground at Hill Park in the suburbs of Brighton, the club joined Division 3 of the Sussex County League in 1984/85, finishing third in their first season. More success followed and a promotion to Division 2 and senior football came in 1988/89 when Saltdean finished as champions. The next seven seasons were spent in this division, with the “Tigers” comfortably winning Division 2 in 1995/96 with games to spare. Promotion to Division 1 saw the clubhouse completely revamped and floodlights installed, the first Sussex County League club to invest in the impressive Musco system from the USA. The Tigers quickly established themselves as a force in the top division, finishing 4th in their inaugural season and reaching the final of the Sussex Senior Cup only to narrowly lose out to St. Leonards by the odd goal. In 1998/99 the club finished 2nd, and 3rd in 1999/2000 season when they also lifted the John O’Hara Cup, beating Burgess Hill Town after extra time in a thrilling match at Three Bridges. In 2002 the club suffered its first ever relegation to Division 2 and in 2007 were relegated again back to Division 3 where they remained for several years until 2011 when the club won the Sussex County League Division 3 Challenge Cup. A positive run in 2011/12 season saw the Tigers show their true spirit as they began the steady climb back up. As runners up in the league they were promoted back to Division 2 and also lifted the Vernon Wentworth Cup. A difficult period followed, with several years spent in the lower half of Division 2 until the 2015/16 season when a change a of circumstances, interest and investment in the club brought a new lease of life to the Tigers. Led by a celebrated ex player with the support of local businessmen the club was transformed on and off the pitch. Within a single season Saltdean Utd went from bottom to top of the league gaining promotion back to the top flight of Sussex football in 2017 and in 2018/19 the Tigers were the proud winners of the Peter Bentley Challenge Cup. In 2017 the Saltdean United Women’s team were formed under the management of Joe McTiffen. The Women have gone from strength to strength and have enjoyed several promotions in a short period of time. As runners up of the Sussex Women’s league in 2017/18, they were promoted to the South East Counties Premier Division. In 2018/19 as runners up in the league they were promoted to the London and South East Premier Division and were winners of the South East Counties Women’s League Cup. Into a new decade and the club continues to thrive, with the First Team enjoying a strong start to the 2020/21 season in the Southern Combination Football League Premier Division under the management of Bryan O’Toole. The Women’s team continue to strengthen their position with the addition of a new Development Squad in 2020 and a partnership with Withdean Youth FC to provide a clear pathway for girls into senior Women’s football. The hard work continues throughout the club, with representation in more leagues and divisions than ever before in the club’s history with Men’s and Women’s First Teams, Women’s Development Squad, Men’s Under 23’s and Under 18’s and Youth Teams from Under 7’s to Under 16’s.

Like all Sussex clubs they didn't play any games during The first world war and part of their pitch was dug up to grow food. After the Great War, Seaford FC played in the Mid Sussex League and won the Montgomery Cup in 1936 and 1939, but again the club had to stop playing games due to world war 2. After the Second World War, they were among the founding members of the Sussex County League Division Two in 1952.Nomad Online Nomad Online – Seaford Town They won promotion to Division One in the 1963–64 season and were an ever-present in the top division until being relegated in 1971. During that period they achieved their highest ever league position – 4th place in 1965–66. The club left the County League in 1978 but rejoined as of the founder members of the new Division Three in 1983. Seaford Town won Division Three in 1985–86 and followed up this success with winning the Division Two title in 1988–89 earning promotion back to the top flight. This spell in Division One only lasted two seasons before they were relegated back in 1991 after finishing 17th. Further relegations followed in 1992–93 and in 1996–97 which saw the club leaving the Sussex County League altogether. After two seasons in the East Sussex League, they regained their County League status and also changed their name to just Seaford as opposed to 'Seaford Town' as they merged with the youth sides Seaford Seagulls which had teams ranging from under 7s all the way through to under 16s.

He was, together with Lovis Corinth and Max Liebermann, one of the foremost representatives in Germany of the plein air style. His work was part of the painting event in the art competition at the 1928 Summer Olympics. Biography He was born in Landshut, Germany, in 1868. From 1885 to 1889 he studied at the Munich Academy, and his early paintings are dark in tone, exemplifying the prevailing style in Munich. In 1889 Slevogt visited Paris, where he attended the Académie Julian. In 1896, he drew caricatures for the magazines Simplicissimus and Jugend, and the next year he had his first solo exhibition in Vienna. Toward the end of the 1890s his palette brightened. He travelled again to Paris in 1900, where he was represented in the German pavilion of the world exhibition with the work Scheherezade, and was greatly impressed by the paintings of Édouard Manet. In 1901 he joined the Berlin Secession. A trip to Egypt in 1914 resulted in 21 oil paintings in a fresh bright style, as well as numerous watercolors and drawings; on the return journey he stopped off in Italy. In June he acquired the country seat Neukastel. After the outbreak of World War I he was sent as official war painter to the western front. The war experience brought about a search for new style appropriate to the expression of the horrors of war. In the same year he became a member of the Prussian Academy of Arts in Berlin. He designed scenery for the performance of Mozart's Don Giovanni in the Dresdner state opera in 1924. In 1929 he was given a large 60th birthday exhibition in the Prussian academy of the arts in Berlin. During the last year of his life he worked on the religious mural Golgatha in the peace church in Ludwigshafen on the Rhine. It was destroyed by bombing raids during World War II. Max Slevogt died in Leinsweiler (at that time in the Rheinpfalz part of Bavaria) in 1932. He is buried in the burial place of the family Finkler east of his house, the so-called Slevogthof (with wall paintings) at Neukastel.

The club is a FA Chartered Standard Community club affiliated to the Sussex County Football Association. The club are currently members of the and play at the High Street Ground. History The club was formed in 1903 playing in various local grounds, before settling at their current home of the High Street ground in the late 1940s. The club played in the West Sussex Football League, winning their first league title in the 1938–39 season, and then winning it a further five times after the Second World War. While in the West Sussex Football League, the club also won the Sussex County FA Intermediate Cup in the 1958–59 campaign. The 1960–61 season saw the club win their last of their six West Sussex Football League titles and gain promotion to Division Two of the Sussex County Football League. The club finished as runners up in their first season, and repeated this finish in the next seasons. The 1963–64 campaign saw the club do a double by finishing top of the division and winning the Division two cup, they also gained promotion to Division one. The club then spent five seasons in Division one before being relegated back to Division two, at the end of the 1968–69 competition, during which time they made their debut in the FA Cup in the 1967–68 season. It took the club another seven seasons before they reached Division one, again as champions of Division two. However they could only spend two seasons in Division one before being relegated and the club took another nine seasons before they bounced back up as runners up in the 1986–87 competition. After just four seasons the club was once again relegated to Division two, when they finished bottom of the division in the 1990–91 season. As before the club eventually bounced back up to Division one when at the end of the 1995–96 campaign they finished in the runners-up position. The club in January 2000 employed former Brighton & Hove Albion defender, Danny Hinshelwood as player manager at the age of 24. Under his management the club went on to win the Sussex Royal Ulster Rifles Charity Cup in the 2001–02 season, followed by the John O'Hara League Cup the following season. In their eighth season in Division one Hinselwood left the club in July 2003 due to the club reducing the playing budget, and the club was relegated at the end of the season. Manager Danny Hinselwood returned to the club the following season after Richie Reynolds resigned and in the 2005–06 season, they finished as runners-up in Division Two and were promoted to Division One. Hinselwood stayed till November 2009, when he resigned and was replaced by Gary Block, during which time he guided the club to another Sussex RUR cup final in the 2007–08 campaign where they lost to Three Bridges 4–0. However Gary block only stayed for a season before resigning and was replaced with Adam Hinshelwood. Adam Hinselwood then guided the club to their third Sussex RUR cup final, but they lost to Rye United 2–0. Adam Hinselwood then quit the club at the end of the season to join Burgess Hill Town, as assistant manager. Richard Towers then took over as manager, but only remained in charge for a few months before he resigned and Adam Hinselwood returned in November 2012 to take over as manager again. 2017/2018 saw a move away for Selsey legend and fans favourite James \\"Snips\\" Parsons, although still there in heart a move to London meant a change however, he vowed to return to Selsey in the future.

In 2008, the company operated 283 convenience stores and gas stations in the US states of Pennsylvania, New York and Ohio, and, as of 1995, its annual sales totaled $327.01 million. Henry Sahakian was Uni-Mart's founder and, as of 1997, the company consisted of 2,700 employees. On 29 May 2008, Uni-Marts LLC filed a voluntary Chapter 11 bankruptcy petition in the US bankruptcy court for the District of Delaware, initiating a process that had been considered by the company's management since September 2007. In December 2009, the company's remaining assets were sold to Kwik Pik LLC, an affiliate of Lehigh Gas Corporation. As of 2016, many stations still operate under the Uni- Mart name. History Henry D. Sahakian started the company in 1972. He opened the first Uni-Mart in State College, Pennsylvania in 1981, having rebranded stores from the Ma-jik Market franchise he had owned since the early 1970s. Uni-Mart quickly developed into a successful convenience store brand and by December 1986, Uni-Mart became a public company on the American Stock Exchange. In September 1996, the company's 10,000 square foot Uni-Mart Center opened in State College and was promoted as \\"America's Largest Convenience Store Under One Roof.\\" In addition to being a convenience store and gasoline station, the mega-center included a Burger King, a Manhattan Bagel, a Fox's Pizza Den, a Mail Boxes Etc., and a bank. In July 2004, Uni-Mart reverted to private company status following the creation of Green Valley Acquisition Co. LLC. By 2008, Uni-Mart owned and operated 283 stores in Pennsylvania, New York and Ohio, but the number of privately owned franchise locations was not clear. In 2006, the company expanded into Ohio by acquiring a small number of BP stations in the Youngstown area. The company proceeded to convert and absorb the convenience stores into the Uni-Mart enterprise in 2007, but continued to sell BP gasoline (the majority of Uni-Mart stations in other areas sell their own brand of gasoline). Uni-Mart had sold other gasoline brands prior to this occasion, with a co-branding deal having been in place with Getty for most of the 1990s and several Pennsylvania stations offering Exxon and Sunoco gasoline until the bankruptcy in 2008. Over two-thirds of Uni-Marts’ locations sell gasoline, with the majority offering the Uni-Mart brand name. Branded gasoline for the other sites is purchased from BP/Amoco, Exxon/Mobil and Sunoco. Downloaded 28 August 2008. The company was made private when Sahakian sold it to Non-resident Indian (NRI) Raj Vakharia, a former managing director of Donaldson, Lufkin & Jenrette.

The station is owned by West Palm Beach, Florida-based Ion Media Networks (the former Paxson Communications). WPXE-TV's offices are located on North Flint Road, straddling the city line between Milwaukee and Glendale, and its transmitter is located on the WITI TV Tower on East Capitol Drive in Shorewood. WPXE-TV's facilities also serve as the main studio for Federal Communications Commission (FCC) purposes for Antigo-based WTPX-TV, which serves the Wausau market and is the only other owned presence of Ion in the state of Wisconsin (as of 2016, the main Ion signal is now carried by subchannels owned by other station groups in Green Bay, Madison and La Crosse). History WPXE's first generation Ion Television logo, used almost exclusively on local productions. (2007-2008) The station first signed on the air on June 1, 1988 as WHKE (for _W_ orld _H_ arvest _K_ enosha _E_ vangelism), operating as a religious station; it was originally owned by LeSEA Broadcasting. The station's original transmitter was located in Kenosha, just north of the Illinois–Wisconsin state line (the tower is remains in use for the transmitter of radio station WWDV, 96.9 FM). Paxson Communications purchased the station in 1995 and turned it into an all- infomercial format as part of the Infomall TV Network (inTV), though it also aired the daily greyhound racing recap program from Kenosha's Dairyland Greyhound Park for many years after WVTV (channel 18) stopped carrying that show in 1996, which met the station's local programming requirements. Former WPXE analog transmitter site in Racine County. The tower on the left continues to be the WVTY tower. In the late 1990s after its purchase by Paxson, the station moved its transmitter to a tower in northern Racine County (near I-94) which was shared with WEZY (92.1 FM; now WVTY, which continues to use the tower). Despite the reason for the transmitter move being to serve more of the Milwaukee market, the southerly tower location from the traditional northeast side tower farm operated at a lower power, mainly to keep the channel 55 allocation open for an eventual new station in Wausau (which would eventually be given to Wittenberg-licensed WFXS in 1999), limited the station's coverage area in southeastern Wisconsin; this caused the station to not be available in Fond du Lac and Sheboygan counties, except through cable. The station became a charter affiliate of Pax TV (now Ion Television) when it launched on August 31, 1998, at which time it changed its call letters to WPXE-TV. At times during summer due to tropospheric propagation in the analog era, WHKE/WPXE would receive heavy interference a few times and even have its signal overwhelmed by that of another distant station on channel 55, WBNX-TV from Cleveland, which broadcast at a stronger power and had its signal brought over Lake Michigan into Wisconsin due to Lake Erie's heavy \\"trop effect\\" amplifying their signal across northern Indiana and lower Michigan. =Possible sale to Scripps= On September 24, 2020, it was announced that the Cincinnati-based E. W. Scripps Company, owner of NBC affiliate WTMJ-TV (channel 4), would purchase Ion Media for $2.65 billion, with financing from Berkshire Hathaway. With this purchase, Scripps will divest 23 Ion-owned stations, but no announcement has been made as to which stations that Scripps will divest as part of the move. The proposed divestitures will allow the merged company to fully comply with the FCC local and national ownership regulations. Scripps has agreed to a transaction with an unnamed buyer, who has agreed to maintain Ion affiliations for the stations. If Scripps decides to keep WPXE-TV, it would become a sister station to WTMJ-TV, as there are no regulatory complications within the Milwaukee market which would prevent such a duopoly.E.W. Scripps scales up with $2.65 billion Berkshire-backed deal for ION Media Digital television RabbitEars TV Query for WPXE =Analog-to- digital conversion= WPXE-TV shut down its analog signal, over UHF channel 55, on June 12, 2009, the official date in which full-power television stations in the United States transitioned from analog to digital broadcasts under federal mandate. The station's digital signal continued to broadcast on its pre-transition UHF channel 40. Through the use of PSIP, digital television receivers display the station's virtual channel as its former UHF analog channel 55, which was among the high band UHF channels (52-69) that were removed from broadcasting use as a result of the transition with that portion of the band being sold to Qualcomm for use in its nationwide MediaFLO system (later sold to AT&T; Mobility for 4G LTE mobile device spectrum). When Qualcomm introduced MediaFLO to Chicago in 2008, WPXE-TV agreed to accept potential interference to 28.87% of the population within its Grade B contour resulting from the service, mostly occurring in fringe areas of Lake County, Illinois which also received Ion service from Chicago sister station WCPX- TV.http://hraunfoss.fcc.gov/edocs_public/attachmatch/DA-07-821A1.txt WPXE's digital signal and subchannels were not affected. On February 2, 2009, the station converted its main digital signal to air high definition content in the 720p format, ahead of Ion's eventual launch of its high definition program schedule. After various tests, however, Ion decided to wait on a full transition and switched back to 480i in April 2009 due to its concerns about a seamless digital transition (as days before February 2, the national transition date was moved by Congress from February 17 to June 12). Full permanent HD service for WPXE launched on April 28, 2010, with the station also receiving HD cable coverage via digital channel 1015 on Time Warner Cable and digital channel 615 on Charter Communications. Programming Typical Ion/Pax legal ID at the bottom of the screen taken from WPXE-TV. The station was formerly involved a local marketing agreement with WTMJ-TV that resulted from that station's affiliated network, NBC, having a stake in Paxson Communications/Pax TV; this resulted in the two stations sharing programming (such as Martha Stewart Living and repeats of preseason Green Bay Packers games produced for WTMJ, and live games during the 2004 Summer Olympics, which aired on WPXE), WPXE airing repeats of WTMJ's evening newscasts for several years, and WTMJ selling advertising time for WPXE. This agreement was discontinued on July 1, 2005 after Pax TV rebranded as i: Independent Television. The station airs the entire Ion Television schedule, with the only local programming consisting of paid programs for local businesses, and a public affairs program, Ion Milwaukee, which airs at various times throughout the week.

He previously served in the Vermont House of Representatives for seven terms (1997–2011), and the Vermont Senate for two (2013–2017). He is the Democratic Nominee for Governor of Vermont in the 2020 election. In 2016 Zuckerman ran for lieutenant governor as a Progressive, and also received the nomination of the Democratic Party by defeating Speaker of the Vermont House of Representatives Shap Smith and Representative Kesha Ram in the Democratic primary. He defeated Republican State Senator Randy Brock in the 2016 general election. Zuckerman was re-elected in 2018. Zuckerman is the first Progressive Party candidate to win statewide office in Vermont. Other Progressive-endorsed candidates who have won statewide-office elections, including Doug Hoffer for Vermont State Auditor, were primarily affiliated with the Vermont Democratic Party. Zuckerman's win reinforced Vermont as a state with the presence of a major party other than the Democratic and Republican parties. On January 13, 2020, Zuckerman announced his intention to run for Governor of Vermont in the 2020 election. Early life Zuckerman grew up in Brookline, Massachusetts, and graduated from Brookline High School in 1989. His father is Jewish.\\"I’ve got 10 generations of New England Yankee blood in me and a Jewish father as well,\\" Zuckerman said. \\"Between the two, (I’m) pretty darn frugal.\\" In 1995, he graduated from the University of Vermont with a bachelor of science degree; he majored in Environmental Studies, with a minor in chemistry. Legislative career =State House of Representatives= Prior to serving in the House, he served on the Burlington Electric Commission. Zuckerman ran for the Vermont House in 1994 while still enrolled in college, and lost by 59 votes. He ran again two years later and become the fourth Progressive Party member to serve in the Vermont State House, a seat that he held through 2011. While in the House, he served for six years on the Natural Resources and Energy Committee as well as six years on the Agriculture Committee, including four as the chairperson. He finished his time in the House of Representatives by serving on the Ways and Means Committee. Zuckerman considered running for the U.S. House of Representatives in the 2006 election when Vermont's lone House seat was being vacated by independent Bernie Sanders, who was a candidate for the United States Senate. Zuckerman eventually decided not to run in order to continue serving as Agriculture chairman in the Vermont House. =State Senate= Zuckerman ran for Vermont State Senate from Chittenden County in the 2012 elections and won a seat in this six-member, at-large district. In the Senate, Zuckerman served on the Agriculture and Education committees; he was vice chairperson of Agriculture, and clerk of Education. In his time in the legislature, Zuckerman was involved in the passage of Vermont's civil union and marriage equality laws, workers' rights legislation, increasing the minimum wage, sustainable (economic and environmental) agricultural policy, cannabis policy reform, election law reform, many renewable energy initiatives, progressive taxation policy as well as universal healthcare. In January 2014, Zuckerman introduced legislation that would allow for recreational sale and use of cannabis. If passed it would allow for possession of up to 2 ounces of cannabis, and the cultivation of up to 3 plants for anyone 21 and over. It would also have the penalty for underage consumption of cannabis be the same as the current penalty for underage drinking. Lieutenant Governor In 2016, Zuckerman ran for Lieutenant Governor as a Progressive candidate, earning the endorsement of Bernie Sanders before the August 9 primary. He ran unopposed in the Progressive primary, while simultaneously defeating Vermont House Speaker Shap Smith and Representative Kesha Ram to win the Democratic nomination, and went on to defeat Republican Randy Brock in the general election. Political positions = Labor = Zuckerman has been a strong advocate of raising the minimum wage, paid family leave, and increasing protections for workers. =Opposition to Bush administration= On April 25, 2006, Zuckerman introduced a resolution for the Vermont State Legislature to ask the United States Congress to impeach President George W. Bush. The motion failed 87–60 in a roll call vote on April 25, 2007. = Property tax reform = Zuckerman supported a bill to lower property tax rates for households earning less than $200,000 in the 2015–16 session. He also helped pass legislation to model this reform in time for the 2017 session. = Equal pay = Zuckerman was a sponsor of H.440 in 2001, a bill which would require equal pay for equal work. = GMO labeling = In 2014, Zuckerman was the lead Senate author of Vermont's first- in-the-nation GMO Labeling Law. =Vaccines= Zuckerman is critical of the philosophy of mandatory vaccinations. He has said that he is skeptical about the Center for Disease Control and Prevention's position on vaccines due to its purported connections to the pharmaceutical industry, but believes the science of vaccination is sound. He said that he believed that most people should vaccinate their children, but believes in exemptions for medical or religious reasons. He said that some of his constituents had said that vaccines gave their children allergic reactions. He has said that his own daughter is vaccinated. = Bernie Sanders = On February 19th 2019, he tweeted his endorsement of Bernie Sanders' presidential campaign, stating, \\"...He was my inspiration to engage in politics as a cynical college student 26 yrs ago. As the national leader for progressive issues for decades I believe he is well positioned to lead our nation.\\" Agriculture Beginning in 1999 Zuckerman and his wife Rachel Nevitt built a successful organic farm in Burlington's Intervale, a network of a dozen farms located in and serving the city. Zuckerman served on the American Farm Bureau Federation Young Farmers & Ranchers Committee. He is also a member of the Vermont Farm Bureau and Northeast Organic Farming Association chapter in Vermont. In 2009 Zuckerman and Nevitt moved their farm to in Hinesburg where they grow of vegetables and raise 1000 chickens. Their produce is almost exclusively sold within Chittenden County. They operate a summer Community Supported Agriculture (CSA) with 275 members, a winter CSA with 125 members, and sell year round at the local Burlington farmers market.

Kwong later became the sole owner of the restaurant under the original name. The current Billy Kwong Potts Point is co- owned with Sydney and Hong Kong chef and restaurateur Andrew Cibej and seismologist and businessman David King. The restaurant made a commitment to use organic and biodynamic food: \\"We now use only organic and biodynamic fruit and vegetables, poultry, meat and noodles. All the soy sauces, sugar, vinegar and oils we flavour our food with are organic, and we serve Fair Trade tea, coffee and chocolate.\\" The restaurant made this transition in 2005. Kwong is quoted as saying \\"I wanted my work and social life to reflect my Buddhism. Offering my customers healthy, life-giving, precious food is the best way for me to help them. Whether it's my books, restaurant or TV show, I'll always ask, Is this sustainable? Is this about uplifting and elevating the energy rather than depleting?\\".I am what i am, Page 8, Sunday Life, The Sun Herald Magazine, 30 August 2009 Billy Kwong received the inaugural Sustainability Award in 2009 from the Sydney Morning Herald Good Food Guide, in recognition of Kwong's environmental initiatives, including the option for diners to donate to a renewable energy credits program, purchased from a wind farm in the Chinese province of Hebei.

It runs from a point east of Pembroke and ends in Savannah. Its routing is located within portions of Bryan and Chatham counties. Route description SR 204 begins at an intersection with US 280/SR 30 in Lanier, Georgia. It heads east through Ellabell, Georgia. It curves to the southeast and parallels the northeastern part of Fort Stewart. It has an interchange with Interstate 95 (I-95), followed by an intersection with US 17/SR 25 (Ocean Highway), an interchange with King George Boulevard, and an interchange with the Veterans Parkway (also known as the Southwest Bypass) southwest of Savannah, in Georgetown. It curves to the northeast and meets Montgomery Cross Road (former SR 204 Spur). It then continues northeast to an intersection with SR 21 (DeRenne Avenue), which leads to I-516. Then, it meets US 80/SR 26 (Victory Drive). A short distance later, it turns left onto 37th Street, and follows that until it meets its eastern terminus, an interchange with I-16/US 17. The highway is two lanes as it travels east through rural Bryan County and the Ellabell community. Once it crosses the Ogeechee River and enters Chatham County, the highway becomes known as Fort Argyle Road. Development is more noticeable as one travels east, and there is a large collection of businesses catering to travelers at the interchange with I-95. It is at this interchange that the highway changes from two lanes to four divided lanes. Traffic is often quite heavy as SR 204 is the major route from I-95 into the busy south side of Savannah. Though SR 204 is known as Abercorn Expressway as it enters Savannah, it is not a freeway until after it passes through a signal at Grove Point Road. While there is a grade separated interchange at US 17/SR 25, there is a at-grade signalized intersection at Grove Point Road, which can cause traffic delays, as it continues closer to Savannah, it becomes a true freeway with an intersection at King George Boulevard (which used to be a signal), where the highway becomes six lanes divided, and another intersection with Veterans Parkway. The speed limit is .The route enters Savannah city limits as it crosses the Forest River. At the signaled intersection with Rio Road, adjacent to the Savannah Mall, the highway loses its controlled access. As the route continues through the south side of Savannah it has an interchange where the Harry S. Truman Parkway begins. SR 204 reaches its eastern terminus at the southern terminus SR 21 (DeRenne Ave). =National Highway System= The west–east portion of SR 204 east of I-95 is the only part of the road that is included within the National Highway System, a system of roadways important to the nation's economy, defense, and mobility. =Miscellaneous notes= In Savannah, SR 204 is a very major and heavily traveled surface arterial road and is known as Abercorn Expressway or Abercorn Street. History The portion of the route running along Abercorn Street was previously numbered as State Route 359. SR 204 used to have its eastern terminus at a partial interchange with I-16. SR 204 continued to follow Abercorn Street north from DeRenne Ave for several blocks to its intersection with 37th Street. Here, it turned left and followed 37th Street, a four lane divided surface arterial, west for a number of blocks. Just west of its intersection with Bulloch Street, SR 204 curved right to follow the short 37th Street Connector, which leads to I-16/US 17, and thus the former end of State Route 204. The former portion of SR 204 was turned over to local control from the state highway system when the Georgia Dept of Transportation (GDOT), the City of Savannah, and Chatham County agreed to add the Jimmy Deloach Parkway (extending SR 17) to the state highway system. The change went into effect February 17, 2020. Major intersections Savannah spur route State Route 204 Spur (SR 204 Spur) was a spur route of SR 204 that connected the mainline to Skidaway Island. SR 204 Spur first appeared on maps in 1990. Segments of SR 204 Spur are named East Montgomery Cross Road, Waters Avenue, Whitfield Avenue, Diamond Causeway, and Tidewater Way. SR 204 Spur was removed from the state highway system when the Georgia Dept of Transportation (GDOT), the City of Savannah, and Chatham County agreed to add the Jimmy DeLoach Parkway (extending SR 17) to the state highway system. The decommissioning went into effect February 17, 2020. SR 204 Spur was not part of the National Highway System, a system of roadways important to the nation's economy, defense, and mobility.

A Field Ambulance (FA) is the name used by the British Army and the armies of other Commonwealth nations to describe a mobile medical unit that treats wounded soldiers very close to the combat zone. In the British military medical system that developed during the First World War, the FAs formed an intermediate level in the casualty evacuation chain that stretched from the Regimental Aid Posts near the front line and the Casualty Clearing Stations located outside the range of the enemy's artillery. FAs were often assigned to the brigades of a division. The term is no longer used in the British Royal Army Medical Corps. They were replaced by medical regiments (which are assigned to brigades) and field hospitals. It is however still used in the Royal Canadian Medical Service within the Canadian Armed Forces.

The city has an estimate 130,000 inhabitants as of 2019 and sits about 150 km (93 miles) from the capital city of the state, Porto Alegre. The city enjoys a high standard of living and gross income per capita is 2.5 times greater than that of the state of Rio Grande do Sul as a whole. History Santa Cruz do Sul was founded on March 31, 1877 by German immigrants, most of whom came from Hunsrück. Even today, the so-called Riograndenser Hunsrückisch is spoken actively in the area around the city. In 1924, a Protestant church was built according to the plans of two German architects. It is one of the largest Protestant Lutheran churches in Rio Grande do Sul and the largest neo- Romanesque church in Latin America. The Protestant church, renovated in 1999 with an organ from 1887 of the German company Ibach from Barmen. Demographics The population of Santa Cruz do Sul has steadily increased, with help from immigration to Brazil during its early history – in 1849 there were 12 inhabitants, ten years later the city population had reached 2723 people, and in 1878 there were ten thousand inhabitants. Most of the early immigrants were farmers and craftsmen. Agriculture The area around Santa Cruz do Sul is mainly agricultural, and produces large quantities of tobacco and soy beans for animal fodder. Most of the tobacco produced in the area is exported as a raw material for cigarette manufacturing plants all over the world. Soy bean processing plants sell several million tons of animal fodder annually, for domestic use and for export. Oktoberfest Each year, the citizens of Santa Cruz do Sul and visitors from the region celebrate Oktoberfest. The city has a large population of German-Brazilians. Thousands turn out each year for the celebration. The Oktoberfest in Santa Cruz do Sul is the third largest in the world, leaving behind only the Oktoberfest in Munich in Germany and Oktoberfest Blumenau of the state of Santa Cartarina in Brazil as well. Tourism The Cathedral of São João Batista is one of the main tourist draws in the city. The adjacent block in front of the Cathedral, Getúlio Vargas Square, is adorned with fountains and trees. São João Batista Cathedral is one of the largest cathedrals in all of Brazil. The main edifice was built between 1928 and 1932 and the two 82-meter (269 ft) tall towers were added later. Awards The Prefeitura Municipal de Santa Cruz do Sul won a 2004 Energy Globe Award for the João-de-Barro Bom-Plac House Project.

One of the three members of the MEK's central committee from 1972 to 1975, he was considered the leader of the group's Muslim faction that refused to accept Marxism.  Early life and background  He came from a \\"highly devout middle-class family\\" and was raised in Isfahan and Tehran. He studied electrical engineering at Aryamehr University of Technology, and became a member of the MEK while he was studying on a scholarship in Abadan's technical college.  Murder  Remnants of Sharif-Vaghefi's corpse By the spring of 1975, when the majority of the MEK turned marxists, he was given an ultimatum by the other two co-members of the central committee who became marxists, Taghi Shahram and Bahram Aram, to accept the new ideology. In order to \\"raise his political consciousnesses\\", he was given the chance to choose between a move to the MEK cell in Mashhad, leaving the country or to work in factories for a while. Sharif-Vaghefi pretended that he wants to go to Mashhad, but instead moved some of the MEK arms and equipment to a new hiding place and tried to organize the part of the MEK that resisted to ideology change. His wife, part of the marxist faction, provided Shahram and Aram with information on his activities. Mainly on Shahram's initiative, Sharif-Vaghefi was killed and his body was immolated and dumped outside the city. SAVAK managed to find the remnants of the body.  Legacy  Following the Iranian Revolution, the place he studied was renamed to \\"Sharif University of Technology\\" in his honour. He is still celebrated as a martyr by the Iranian government.

It was built in 1850, was automated in 1965, and is still in operation. It is located at the easternmost point of the island, in the village of Siasconset. It was one of the first lighthouses in the United States to receive a Fresnel lens. History The shoals off the eastern coast of Nantucket had a long history as a hazard to navigation. The United States government decided in the 1840s that a prominent lighthouse should be erected to alert mariners to that hazard. Congress appropriated $12,000 for its construction in 1848, with additional funds totaling $8,000 in following years. The light went into service in February 1850. The tower is high; its lower portion is constructed of brick, and its upper part is granite. The light's turning mechanism was powered by a weight-driven brass clockwork, A brick house was built next to the tower at the time of its construction to house the light keeper's family. In 1887 this house was torn down and a new structure was built. Renovations to the tower at the time included installation of a new lantern section, adding some to its height. In 1933 the light was electrified, and the mechanical works to turn it were taken out of service. Its original lens was removed in 1950, and is now at the Nantucket Whaling Museum. The light was fully automated in 1965. In 1987, the lighthouse was listed on the National Register of Historic Places as the Sankaty Head Light. The 'Sconset Trust acquired the lighthouse in 2007, and had it moved away from the eroding bluff (approximately ) in October of that year.

Rennell is the largest raised coral atoll in the world and the area in East Rennell surrounding Lake Tegano contains many endemic species. In 2013, the World Heritage Committee added East Rennell to the List of World Heritage in Danger because of the threat of logging activities to the site's outstanding universal value. Site Rennell is situated in the Western Pacific and is the southernmost of the Solomon Islands, being some . It is the largest uplifted coral atoll in the world, occupying . It is mostly clad in dense forest and in the centre of the south end of the island is Lake Tegano (also known as Te Nggano), which was at one time the atoll's lagoon; the surface of the lake is at sea level and the water is brackish. It is surrounded by cliffs and contains a number of small limestone islands. East Rennell, designated as a World Heritage Site in 1998, is at the southern end of the island; the site includes Lake Tegano, the land surrounding it, and the marine areas stretching for three nautical miles from the island. The site is unspoiled, prone to damage by cyclones, and is \\"considered to be a true natural laboratory for scientific study.\\" History The island has about 800 inhabitants living in four villages around Lake Tegano. They are subsistence farmers and fishermen, relying on the forests and waters to provide them with all their basic needs. A management plan for the site was completed in 2007 in conjunction with the islanders which recognises their rights to continue their traditional cultural practices and way of life. These are thought not to be detrimental to the site, the IUCN stating that \\"customary ownership can be more conducive to conservation than if the land was under the control of a distant government office\\". Flora and fauna The island is covered with dense forest which provides habitat for the many bird species. It is logging in the west end of the island, outside the site area, which is threatening the bird population of the whole island by depleting the areas of the forest they need. As a result, in 2013, UNESCO added East Rennell to its List of World Heritage in Danger. Fifty species of bird have been recorded on the island, twenty-one of these being endemic. The site has been identified by BirdLife International as an Important Bird Area (IBA) because it supports populations of several of these bird species, including silver-capped fruit doves, yellow- bibbed lories, Rennell parrots, green pygmy parrots, cardinal myzomelas, Rennell gerygones, Rennell fantails, Melanesian flycatchers, Rennell shrikebills, bare-eyed and Rennell white-eyes, and Rennell starlings. One reptile of note is Crocker's sea snake, an endemic species found in Lake Tegano and nowhere else in the world. There are 11 species of bat (one endemic), 27 species of land snail (seven endemics) and close to 730 insect species, many of which are endemic present in the region. Over 300 species of diatoms and algae, a few of them endemic, form its rich flora.

The station has a range of programs including news, sports, current affairs, social issues, football calls, gardening, lifestyle, cars, travel and health. It is owned by NOVA Entertainment.  History  5AA commenced service in Kent Town on 14 March 1976 on the frequency 1390 am. It was moved to 1386 AM with the introduction of 9 kHz spacing on the AM dial in 1978. The station now broadcasts on 1395 AM. 5AA commenced its life with a \\"Beautiful Music\\" format and quickly became Adelaide's no 1 rating radio station. In 1976, the only FM competition was ABC Classic FM. AM stations were ABC Adelaide, 5DN 972 - \\"Licensed to talk\\" and music stations 5KA on 1197AM and 5AD on 1323AM. In the 1980s, 5AA was sold to the State Government-owned TAB betting agency, ditching music to begin broadcasting horse and dog racing, with talkback in between race calls. The station shifted to the TAB headquarters in Pulteney Court, Adelaide, with \\"Talk of the Town\\" as its slogan. However, it plummeted in popularity as a result of its schizophrenic broadcasting policy. With the advent of narrowcast licences, the TAB purchased frequency 1539AM and shifted all racing there, freeing up 5AA for talk and interviews. A new slogan was adopted in the early 1990s; \\"5AA, Where you don't miss a thing\\" and the station began a slow rise in the ratings to challenge ABC Radio and 5DN (now Cruise 1323). On 27 September 1996, 5AA was separated from the TAB and sold by the State Liberal Olsen Government as part of its asset sales program to repay state debt, 5 years after the $3 billion collapse of the State Bank. The new owner was dmg Radio Australia, with CEO Paul Thompson, which had national headquarters in Adelaide. In 2000, another new logo was adopted with the slogan \\"Interactive Radio FIVEaa\\". In October 2004 the station shifted to new premises in Hindmarsh Square alongside Nova 91.9FM, also owned by dmg Radio Australia, which had launched two months earlier. In November 2009 dmg (now NOVA Entertainment) sold 50% of the station to Lachlan Murdoch's company Illyria, and Paul Thompson became non-executive Chairman for six months. When NOVA itself was acquired by Illyria in September 2012, it became the sole owner of the station.

The following season in Division One, they won a league and cup double, in 1977–78 in the Premier Division they won another league and cup double. However, by 1991 the club were back in Division Two of the league. The club were admitted back into Division Three of the Sussex County League for the 1997–98 season. In the 1998–99 season, the club finished 4th and were promoted into Division Two, where they have remained since. The club managed to reach the final of the Division Two Challenge Cup in the 2002–03 season, which saw them finish 6th in the league, they missed out to league champions and local rivals Rye & Iden United. The club finished in 3rd in 2006–07, however due to having no floodlights at their home ground, could not get promoted into Division One.

The stores were noted for the architecture of their store fronts which was an enormous, sweeping archway with the store name spelled in individual letters fanned across the top.  History  The name White Front was said to refer to the practice of lining up appliances (so-called \\"white goods\\") like washers, dryers and stoves in front of the store, giving it a \\"white front.\\" Another feature of each store was that each had a separate key booth located in the parking lot. In 1929, the company was founded and opened its first store at 7651 S. Central Avenue in Florence, South Los Angeles In 1950 it expanded this store. In advertisements it explained that its location was in a “low rent area”.https://www.newspapers.com/clip/55966833/white-front-expansion/ Its second store opened in October 1957 at 16040 Sherman Way in Van Nuys.via NewspaperArchive.com.

Interstate expanded the chain to other California locations and broadened its retail mix beyond the original housewares.White Front, Memories, Torrance High School Class of 1973. In September 1960, Interstate also acquired Topps, which at the time had 10 stores. For several years, White Front was the leading discount store in the U.S. = Entering the Portland market = In 1970, the company made an attempt to expand into Oregon market at the Mall 205 in Portland, Oregon The Oregonian (photo of grand opening of Mall 205 with White Front store) September 18, 1970. The store had it's grand opening on September 19, 1970. The grand opening ceremony featured Allen Ludden of Password fame (most store openings were promoted by Hollywood stars) See Password episode from September 18, 1970. The Portland store failed largely due to competition from other retailers. Plans were made to construct additional stores in Beaverton and Milwaukee but they never materialized. = Entering the Puget Sound market = White Front entered the Seattle/Tacoma market on October 19, 1967, with the North Seattle location in a 155,000-square-foot building and a parking lot with a capacity for 1,000 vehicles. The grand opening was hosted by the stars of Petticoat Junction, Howard Duff, and Sharon Vaughn, the former Miss Washington of 1958, who was known as Miss White Front for the opening. It was televised live for three hours on KING-TV. Four additional stores were built in high-traffic areas in Burien, Tacoma, Bellevue, and Everett. All but the Everett location were closed by January 19, 1973. The last ad for White Front appeared in The Seattle Times on December 9, 1972. The Everett and Portland stores remained open (the only two locations to remain open outside of California) while the remaining stores' merchandise was liquidated until February 1973. According to a December 14 article in The Seattle Times, the company stated that \\"the five stores hadn't begun to turn a profit\\".. While the company was quiet about the closures, local factors including the \\"Boeing Bust\\", could have played a role in the downturn of the chain in the area. Archives about the company doesn't indicate a local distribution center in the Northwest. In an article published by The Seattle Times (on June 16th, 1972) General Manager Walter Craig, explained that the stores had yet to make a profit in the Northwest but wanted to retool the stores for the customer base by adding more lights, widening aisles for better traffic flow, repainting the exterior of the building, and restriping the parking lots spending $250,000. The company implemented a \\"Friedlee\\" program complete with an elf like mascot to improve customer service . Three of the four closed stores were acquired by Weisfields to become Valu-Mart/Leslie's stores by the end of 1973. The grocery sections were leased to Associated Grocers. The Tacoma store had seen many ownership changes: first as a Valu-Mart/Leslie's store (acquired in February 1973),Seattle Times December 19, 1972 later a Jafco and then a Best store (currently Michael's). The Burien store became the flagship store for Valu- Mart/Leslie's (currently Fred Meyer). It was acquired from White Front in February 1973. The Burien location is one of the larger stores in the Fred Meyer chain. The North Seattle store became a Kmart (closed in January 2013). The Everett store (appears to have remained opened until the company's complete liquidation in 1974 according to Everett Mall leasing records) was integrated into Everett Mall in 1977 to become a Bon Marché and then Macy's (Macy's recently closed the store).

The towering store signs used for the locations remain visible at the North Seattle and Tacoma sites. Stores built before 1970 contained a \\"Discount Foods\\" grocery store department. Safeway Inc. took ownership of the grocery section in some markets, and newer-design stores, such as those in Everett and Bellevue that were built without the arch, also did not have a grocery store. = Bankruptcy = In 1966, Interstate acquired the toy store chain Children's Supermart, predecessor of Toys \\"R\\" Us. White Front was closed after Interstate filed for bankruptcy in 1974. Linkvia ProQuest. Some of the locations were changed to Two Guys, another discount chain. Two Guys soon failed as well, and the stores became relabeled as FedMart stores, which eventually were purchased by Target. The Target store in San Bernardino, California sported the archway across its facade for many years until a recent remodeling. The White Front store on California Avenue in Bakersfield, California, was taken over by Zody's. Later it was purchased and remodeled by Mervyns, which soon went out of business. A number of independent local pharmacies continue to carry the White Front name in Costa Mesa and elsewhere, having inherited it from their former host stores, but are otherwise unrelated.

Bosonic fields obey canonical commutation relations, as distinct from the canonical anticommutation relations obeyed by fermionic fields. Examples include scalar fields, describing spin-0 particles such as the Higgs boson, and gauge fields, describing spin-1 particles such as the photon. Basic properties Free (non-interacting) bosonic fields obey canonical commutation relations. Those relations also hold for interacting bosonic fields in the interaction picture, where the fields evolve in time as if free and the effects of the interaction are encoded in the evolution of the states. It is these commutation relations that imply Bose–Einstein statistics for the field quanta. Examples Examples of bosonic fields include scalar fields, gauge fields, and symmetric 2-tensor fields, which are characterized by their covariance under Lorentz transformations and have spins 0, 1 and 2, respectively. Physical examples, in the same order, are the Higgs field, the photon field, and the graviton field. Of the last two, only the photon field can be quantized using the conventional methods of canonical or path integral quantization. This has led to the theory of quantum electrodynamics, one of the most successful theories in physics. Quantization of gravity, on the other hand, is a long-standing problem that has led to development of theories such as string theory and loop quantum gravity. Spin and statistics The spin–statistics theorem implies that quantization of local, relativistic field theories in 3+1 dimensions may lead either to bosonic or fermionic quantum fields, i.e., fields obeying commutation or anti-commutation relations, according to whether they have integer or half-integer spin, respectively. Thus bosonic fields are one of the two theoretically possible types of quantum field, namely those corresponding to particles with integer spin. In a non-relativistic many-body theory, the spin and the statistical properties of the quanta are not directly related. In fact, the commutation or anti-commutation relations are assumed based on whether the theory one intends to study corresponds to particles obeying Bose–Einstein or Fermi–Dirac statistics. In this context the spin remains an internal quantum number that is only phenomenologically related to the statistical properties of the quanta. Examples of non-relativistic bosonic fields include those describing cold bosonic atoms, such as Helium-4. Such non-relativistic fields are not as fundamental as their relativistic counterparts: they provide a convenient 're-packaging' of the many-body wave function describing the state of the system, whereas the relativistic fields described above are a necessary consequence of the consistent union of relativity and quantum mechanics.

At the age of 17 she met a young man, according to some accounts, the son of Gugliemo di Pecora, lord of Valiano, and she ran away with him. Soon Margaret found herself installed in the castle, not as her master's wife, for convention would never allow that, but as his mistress, which was more easily condoned. For ten years, she lived with him near Montepulciano and bore him a son. When her lover failed to return home from a journey one day, Margaret became concerned. The unaccompanied return of his favorite hound alarmed Margaret, and the hound led her into the forest to his murdered body. That crime shocked Margaret into a life of prayer and penance.Foley OFM, Leonard, \\"St. Margaret of Cortona, Saint of the Day, Lives, Lessons, and Feast, revised by Pat Mccloskey OFM, Franciscan Media Margaret returned to his family all the gifts he had given her and left his home. With her child, she returned to her father's house, but her stepmother would not have her. Margaret and her son then went to the Franciscan friars at Cortona, where her son eventually became a friar. She fasted, avoided meat, and subsisted on bread and vegetables. In 1277, after three years of probation, Margaret joined the Third Order of Saint Francis and chose to live in poverty. Following the example of Francis of Assisi, she begged for sustenance and bread. She pursued a life of prayer and penance at Cortona, and there established a hospital for the sick, homeless and impoverished. To secure nurses for the hospital, she instituted a congregation of Tertiary Sisters, known as \\"le poverelle\\" (Italian for \\"the little poor ones\\"). While in prayer, Margaret recounted hearing the words, \\"What is your wish, poverella?\\" (\\"little poor one?\\"), and she replied, \\"I neither seek nor wish for anything but You, my Lord Jesus.\\" She also established an order devoted to Our Lady of Mercy and the members bound themselves to support the hospital and to help the needy. On several occasions, Margaret participated in public affairs. Twice, claiming divine command, she challenged the Bishop of Arezzo, Guglielmo Ubertini Pazzi, in whose diocese Cortona lay, because he lived and warred like a prince. She moved to the ruined church of Basil of Caesarea, now Santa Margherita, and spent her remaining years there; she died on 22 February 1297.Butler, Alban, The Lives or the Fathers, Martyrs and Other Principal Saints, Vol.II, D. & J.

Early life and education Shah Jalal Mazar Mosque Jalal was said to have been born on 25 May 1271. Various traditions and historical documents differ in his place of birth. A number of scholars have claimed that he was born in Konya in modern- day Turkey (then in the Sultanate of Rum) and later moved to Greater Yemen either as a child or young adult. Many others believe he was born in a village called Kaninah in Hadhramaut, Yemen. His biography was first recorded in Sharḥ Nuzhat al-Arwāḥ (Commentary on the excursion of the souls) by Shaikh 'Ali Sher Bangali in 1571. The author was a descendant of one of Shah Jalal's senior companions, Haydar Ghazi. Thus, there is a gap of two centuries between the life of the saint and that of his earliest biographer. According to this account, Shah Jalal had been born in Turkestan, where he became a spiritual disciple of Ahmad Yasawi. His mother, Syeda Haseenah Fatimah, and his father, Mahmud ibn Muhammad ibn Ibrahim, were descendants of the Quraysh tribe in Makkah.Rahman, M. F., Hazrat Shah Jalal and 360 Awliya, Deshkaal Publications, Sylhet, 1992, p.12-13 His mother was the daughter of Jalaluddin Surkh-Posh Bukhari. Jalal's father was a cleric and contemporary of the Sufi mystic Rumi and died five years after his son's birth. Jalal was educated and raised by his maternal uncle, Syed Ahmad Kabir Suhrawardi. in Makkah. He excelled in his studies; became a hafiz and mastered fiqh. He became a makhdoom, teacher of Sunnah and, for performing prayers in solitary milieu and leading a secluded life as an ascetic, al Mujarrad was post-fixed to his name. It is claimed he achieved spiritual perfection (Kamaliyyat) after 30 years of study, practice and meditation.Islam in South Asia in practice source of suhel-e-yamani By Barbara Daly Metcalf, Published by – Princeton universiti press, 2009. Page 385 Travel to South Asia Jalal's maternal uncle, Syed Ahmad Kabir, gave him a handful of soil and asked him to travel to the Indian subcontinent. He instructed him to choose to settle and propagate Islam in any place in India where the soil exactly matches that which he gave him in smell and colour. Shah Jalal journeyed eastward from Makkah and met many great scholars and Sufi mystics. Sheikh Ali of Yemen gave up his duty as a prince to join Jalal on his expedition. Other disciples joining him from the Arabian peninsula included his nephew Shah Paran as well as Hafiz Muhammad Zakariya Arabi, Daud Qurayshi of Makkah, Sulayman Qarni and Kamal Pahlawan Yemeni. Jalal also came across Sheikh Chashni Pir, a pedologist who would check the soil of the places that Shah Jalal would visit in order to find the matching soil given by Sheikh Ahmad Kabir. Jalal passed through Baghdad and was present there during the time of the murder of the last Abbasid caliph Al-Musta'sim in 1258. He gained a following here, including the likes of Shah Mustafa, Syed Ismail and Syed Yusuf. Driven off by the Mongol invasion of Baghdad, they continued journeying to the east. In Iran, the group was joined by Shah Kala and Shah Irani. Jalal reached Uch in the Punjab, where he and many of his companions were initiated into the Sufi order of Suhrawardiyya. Jalal was joined by many other disciples from more northerly places above Uch such as Syed Umar Samarqandi of Samarqand, Arif Multani of Multan, and Makhdum Zafar Ghaznawi of Ghazni. Shah Jalal then reached Gujarat, where he was joined by Shah Malum, and Narnaul where he met Shah Halim ad-Din Narnauli. Shah Jalal then passed through Delhi where he was made a guest of the Sufi saint Nizamuddin Auliya and met Shah Gabru of Balochistan. Nizamuddin offered him a gift of two rare pigeons which would later be called Jalali Kobutor (Pigeons of Jalal). It is said that these pigeons continue to breed and its descendants remain around Jalal's dargah. Before reaching the Bengal, Jalal came across Haji Sheikh Shamsuddin Bihari who also joined him in the expedition. Conquest of Sylhet Tomb of Hazrat Shah Jalal in Sylhet In 1303, Sultan Shamsuddin Firoz Shah of Lakhnauti was engaged in a war with the neighbouring Gour Kingdom in the Sylhet region, then under the rule of the Hindu king Gour Govinda. This began when Shaykh Burhanuddin, a Muslim living in Sylhet, sacrificed a cow for his newborn son's aqiqah (birth celebration). Govinda, in a fury for what he saw as sacrilege, had the newborn killed as well as having Burhanuddin's right hand cut off. When word of this reached Sultan Firoz Shah, an army commanded by his nephew, Sikandar Khan and later his Sipah Salar (Commander-in-chief) Syed Nasiruddin, was sent against Gour. Three successive strikes were attempted, all ending in failure due to the Bengali armies inexperience in the foreign terrain as well as Govinda's superior military strategy.Bangladesh Bureau of Statistics, Statistics Division, Ministry of Planning, Government of the People's Republic of Bangladesh,\\"Population Census of Bangladesh, 1974: District census report\\" (1979), p. 15 A fourth attack, now with the aid of Shah Jalal and his companions (at this point numbering 360) was undertaken. Jalal may have been summoned by Firoz Shah for aid after the initial failed attacks against Gour Govinda. Alternatively, he may already have been present in Sylhet, fighting against the Hindu king independently prior to being approached by the Sultan. The combined Muslim forces ultimately claimed victory against Gour. Govinda was forced to retreat and Sylhet was brought under Muslim control. According to tradition, Shah Chashni Pir at this point compared the soil in Sylhet with that which was previously given to Jalal by his uncle, finding them to be identical. In any case, following the battle, Jalal and his followers settled in Sylhet. A Persian inscription from 1303 has since been discovered in Jalal's dargah. It mentioned Sikandar's victory in Arsah Srihat with the aid of the saint during the reign of Firoz Shah. This inscription can now be found in Bangladesh National Museum. Later life During the later stages of his life, Jalal devoted himself to propagating Islam. The famous traveller Ibn Battuta, then in Satgaon,Hazrat Shah Jalal O Sylhet er Itihas by Syed Mujtaba Ali, re-published by Utsa Prakashan, Dhaka, 1988, p.60 made a one-month journey through the mountains of Kamarupa, north-east of Sylhet, to meet him.Rihla 9, 1344 On his way to Sylhet via Habung, Ibn Battuta was greeted by several of Jalal's disciples who had come to assist him on his journey many days before he had arrived. At the meeting in 1345, Ibn Battuta noted that Shah Jalal was tall and lean, fair in complexion and lived by the mosque in a cave, where his only item of value was a goat he kept for milk, butter, and yogurt. He observed that the companions of the Shah Jalal were foreign and known for their strength and bravery. He also mentions that many people would visit Jalal to seek guidance.Islam in South Asia in practice By – Barbara Daly Metcalf, Published – Princeton university press Uk 2009, Page 383 – 385. The meeting between Ibn Battuta and Shah Jalal is described in his Arabic travelogue, Rihla (The Journey). Even today in Hadramaut, Yemen, Jalal's name is established in folklore.The rise of Islam and the Bengal frontier, 1204–1760, By Richard Maxwell Eaton, Published by – university of california press, page 76 The exact date of his death is debated, but he is reported by Ibn Battuta to have died on 20 Dhul Qa'dah 746 AH (15 March 1346 CE).Rahman, M. F., Hazrat Shah Jalal and 360 Awliya, p.13, Deshkaal Publications, Sylhet, 1992 He was buried in Sylhet in his dargah (tomb), which is located in a neighbourhood now known as Dargah Mahalla. Whether or not he has descendents is debated. He appointed his closest companion, Haji Muhammad Yusuf to be the khadim (guardian) of his dargah and Yusuf's descendants, the Sareqaum family, continue to have this role. Where he lies, a soul eternal, The much-loved awliya of Allah, Hazrat Shah Jalal.Ziaul Haque, Md., Hazrat Shah Jalal (R.A): An Epic, p.114, Choitonno Publication, Sylhet, 2015 His shrine is famous in Sylhet and throughout Bangladesh, with hundreds of both Muslim and Hindu devotees visiting daily. According to Bipin Chandra Pal, the Sadhus believe that Shah Jalal was an incarnation of Mahadeva. He is buried next to four of his companions. The ex-Prince of Yemen, Shahzada Sheikh Ali to his south, Haji Yusuf to his east and Haji Khalil and Haji Dariya both to his west. The largest mosque in Sylhet was built at the Dargah (also one of the largest in Bangladesh).

Shah Paran () was a 14th-century Sufi saint of the Sylhet region. In 1303, he took part in the final battle of the Conquest of Sylhet led by his maternal uncle Shah Jalal. Biography A mosque built next to the dargah of Shah Paran. Shah Paran's birth name is unknown though it has been suggested that his name was Farhan which later got corrupted into Poran, meaning \\"soul\\". Poran is used as a term of endearment in the Bengali language. Others suggest that Shah Paran was a corruption of Shah Piran meaning \\"king of pirs\\". He was born in Hadramaut, Yemen in the 13th century. His father's name was Muhammad who died when Paran was 11 years old. Paran studied under his grandfather Syed Ahmad Kabir Suhrawardi and later with Amin, a dervish from Neshapur. He decided to accompany Shah Jalal, his maternal uncle, in his expedition across the Indian subcontinent to propagate the religion of Islam. In 1303, Paran took part in the final battle of the Conquest of Sylhet under Shah Jalal's leadership against Raja Gour Govinda. Following the victory, Shah Jalal ordered his companions to disperse across Eastern Bengal and surrounding areas. Paran established a khanqah on top of a hill in modern-day Khadim Nagar, Dakshingarh which came to be known as Shah Paran's hill. Death and legacy Entrance gate to Shah Paran's shrine.

Etymology \\"Dadu\\" means brother, and \\"Dayal\\" means \\"the compassionate one\\". Early life He was reputedly found by an affluent business man floating on the river Sabarmati. Dadupanth Dadu Dayal later moved to Naraina, near Jaipur Rajasthan, where he gathered around himself a group of followers, forming a sect that became known as the Dadupanth. Dadupanthis are one of the 7 martial akharas of Vaishnavite Sampradaya of Hindus. Vaishnavism has following four major sects: ** Sri founded by Ramananda, Dadupanthis are one of those 7 martial akharas of Vaishnavite in the sec of Ramanada ** Brahma founded by Madhava ** Ridra founded by Vishnusuvamin ** Sanakadi founded by Nimbarka. Followers of Vaishnavism are also called Bairagi or Vairagi. Among the Bairagi, those who became part of the military akharas were organised in the 7 akharas founding dates of most of which are unclear. Each of the akhara accepted members from all 4 sects of vaishnavism. Bairagi military akharas generally did not follow the prohibition against eating meat or taking of narcotics.David N. Lorenzen, 2006, Who Invented Hinduism: Essays on Religion in History, Yoda Press, p.51-65. =Dadu Anubhav Vani= Dadu's compositions in Braj language were recorded by his disciple Rajjab and are known as the Dadu Anubhav Vani, a compilation of 5,000 verses. Another disciple, Janagopal, wrote the earliest biography of Dadu. Dadu alludes to spontaneous (sahaja) bliss in his songs. Much of the imagery used is similar to that used by Kabir, and to that used by earlier Sahajiya Buddhists and Nath yogis. Dadu believed that devotion to God should transcend religious or sectarian affiliation, and that devotees should become non-sectarian or \\"Nipakh\\".Dadu on Realisation at sahajayoga.org He has something to say about that: =Dadupanthi Thambas = Dadu had 100 disciples that attained samadhi. He instructed additional 52 disciples to set up ashrams, 'Thambas' around the region to spread the Lord's word. Dadu ji spent the latter years of his life in Naraiana, a small distance away from the town of Dudu, near Jaipur city. Five thambas are considered sacred by the followers; Naraiana, Bhairanaji, Sambhar, Amer, and Karadala (Kalyanpura). Followers at these thambas later set up other places of worship. =Dadupanthi Martial Akharas = Armed martial akharas were first likely formed by the Dadupantji guru Jait Sahib (1693 - 1734 CE) when he recruited armed Naga sadhus. In 1733, Dadupanthis were tax paying farmers in Jaipur State and martial Naga Sadhus were employed to enforce the payment of taxes. In 1793, Dadupanthis and Jaipur State had an agreement under which Dadhupanthis provided 5000 armed soldier sadhus to defend the Jaipur State. During the 1857 rebellion, Dadupanthis acted as mercenaries who helped British raj. =Prominent Dadupanthis= =Present status = Dadupanth has continued in Rajasthan to the present-day and has been a major source of early manuscripts containing songs by Dadu and other North Indian saints.

Commonly referred to as the \\"queen of all dates\\", the authentic North-african Deglet Nour date has a soft touch, a translucent light color and a soft honey-like taste, characteristics which distinguish it from other dates. Deglet Nours are popular in Algeria, Libya, Tunisia, and the United States where it is grown in inland oases and is the chief export cultivar. Despite being grown in several Mediterranean countries, the Deglet Nour dates' origin is disputed between Algeria and Tunisia, with both countries claiming the right to the label \\"Deglet Nour\\". Tunisia (the world-leading export country of Deglet Nour dates with a market share of 48 percent) and Algeria ( the leading producer with only 20 percent market share) are the main suppliers to the European Union.http://www.fao.org/docrep/006/J1851E/j1851e05.htm. Deglet Nour is one of hundreds of cultivars of date palm but is, according to the Food and Agriculture Organization of the United Nations (FAO), the leading date in terms of export value. Origins Several old books provide evidence that the Deglet Nour date was first grown in Algeria. Among them are Le palmier-dattier by Pierre Munier, L'Algérie: un siècle de colonisation française by Félix Falck, Un voyage au pays des dattes by Jean-Henri Fabre as well as le Bulletin de la Société botanique de France. Munier states that the fruit was introduced at the end of the 13th century and at the beginning of the 14th century in the areas of Biskra and Oued Righ in Algeria before being brought to Tunisia at the end of the 17th century by a grower from Tozeur named Sidi Touati. The Algerian Ministry of Agriculture has decided to act in order to reserve the Deglet Nour label to Algerian dates.http://www.algerienews.info/benaissa-promet-de-recuperer-le-label/ Production This cultivar of date is mainly grown in Algeria (Tolga, Oued Righ), in Tunisia (in the areas of Jérid and Nefzaoua), and in the United States (in California, Arizona and Texas) where this cultivar was brought at the beginning of the 20th century.

Wyeth. Early life and education Boyd was born in Dauphin County, Pennsylvania, into a wealthy coal and oil family. He was the son of John Yeomans Boyd and Eleanor Gilmore Herr Boyd, who were from North Carolina. He attended The Hill School.http://pabook2.libraries.psu.edu/palitmap/bios/Boyd__James.html He attended Princeton University where he wrote verse and fiction for the Tiger and was its managing editor in his senior year. After graduation in 1910, he studied at Trinity College and Cambridge. Career Boyd served overseas with the Army Ambulance Service in World War I. After World War I, he experienced ill health, and retired to Weymouth, a house his grandfather built in Southern Pines, North Carolina. The house was added to the National Register of Historic Places in 1982. Boyd's first book, Drums, was set in Edenton, North Carolina, and has been called the best novel written about the American Revolution. Illustrated by N.C. Wyeth, Drums was included in Life Magazine's list of the 100 outstanding books of 1924-1944.Canby, Henry Seidel. \\"The 100 Outstanding Books of 1924 - 1944\\". Life Magazine, 14 August 1944. Chosen in collaboration with the magazine's editors. He wrote five historical novels, including Bitter Creek, which were thought to have elevated the genre through greater historical accuracy, psychological and sociological awareness, and formal craftsmanship. In 1940, Boyd organized the Free Company of Players, a group of American writers. This was a coalition of talent that, despite the powerful opposition of right-wing conservative interests, produced a series of original radio plays in response to what they saw as antidemocratic attitudes prevalent in America due to the growing war in Europe. One of his major accomplishments was to bring to his hometown and Weymouth many of the finest writers of the time. Some of the writers who attended were Paul Green, Thomas Wolfe, Sherwood Anderson, William Faulkner, Struthers Burt, and John Galsworthy. In 1941, Boyd bought The Pilot, a regional newspaper. Boyd died in 1944, at age 55, in Princeton, New Jersey, where he had traveled for a speaking engagement.

This usage derives from the lambda calculus, a model of computation introduced by Alonzo Church in the 1930s and widely used by programming-language researchers. It graces the cover of the classic text Structure and Interpretation of Computer Programs, and the title of the so- called Lambda Papers of 1975 to 1980, written by Gerald Jay Sussman and Guy Steele, the developers of the Scheme programming language. Programming language theory (PLT) is a branch of computer science that deals with the design, implementation, analysis, characterization, and classification of programming languages and of their individual features. It falls within the discipline of computer science, both depending on and affecting mathematics, software engineering, linguistics and even cognitive science. It has become a well-recognized branch of computer science, and an active research area, with results published in numerous journals dedicated to PLT, as well as in general computer-science and engineering publications.  History  In some ways, the history of programming language theory predates even the development of programming languages themselves. The lambda calculus, developed by Alonzo Church and Stephen Cole Kleene in the 1930s, is considered by some to be the world's first programming language, even though it was intended to model computation rather than being a means for programmers to describe algorithms to a computer system. Many modern functional programming languages have been described as providing a \\"thin veneer\\" over the lambda calculus,http://www.c2.com/cgi/wiki?ModelsOfComputation and many are easily described in terms of it. The first programming language to be invented was Plankalkül, which was designed by Konrad Zuse in the 1940s, but not publicly known until 1972 (and not implemented until 1998). The first widely known and successful high-level programming language was Fortran, developed from 1954 to 1957 by a team of IBM researchers led by John Backus. The success of FORTRAN led to the formation of a committee of scientists to develop a \\"universal\\" computer language; the result of their effort was ALGOL 58. Separately, John McCarthy of MIT developed the Lisp programming language (based on the lambda calculus), the first language with origins in academia to be successful. With the success of these initial efforts, programming languages became an active topic of research in the 1960s and beyond. Some other key events in the history of programming language theory since then: = 1950s = * Noam Chomsky developed the Chomsky hierarchy in the field of linguistics; a discovery which has directly impacted programming language theory and other branches of computer science. = 1960s = * The Simula language was developed by Ole-Johan Dahl and Kristen Nygaard; it is widely considered to be the first example of an object-oriented programming language; Simula also introduced the concept of coroutines. * In 1964, Peter Landin is the first to realize Church's lambda calculus can be used to model programming languages. He introduces the SECD machine which \\"interprets\\" lambda expressions. * In 1965, Landin introduces the J operator, essentially a form of continuation. * In 1966, Landin introduces ISWIM, an abstract computer programming language in his article The Next 700 Programming Languages. It is influential in the design of languages leading to the Haskell programming language. * In 1966, Corrado Böhm introduced the programming language CUCH (Curry-Church).C. Böhm and W. Gross (1996). Introduction to the CUCH. In E. R. Caianiello (ed.), Automata Theory, p. 35-64/ * In 1967, Christopher Strachey publishes his influential set of lecture notes Fundamental Concepts in Programming Languages, introducing the terminology R-values, L-values, parametric polymorphism, and ad hoc polymorphism. * In 1969, J. Roger Hindley publishes The Principal Type-Scheme of an Object in Combinatory Logic, later generalized into the Hindley-Milner type inference algorithm. * In 1969, Tony Hoare introduces the Hoare logic, a form of axiomatic semantics. * In 1969, William Alvin Howard observed that a \\"high-level\\" proof system, referred to as natural deduction, can be directly interpreted in its intuitionistic version as a typed variant of the model of computation known as lambda calculus. This became known as the Curry–Howard correspondence. = 1970s = * In 1970, Dana Scott first publishes his work on denotational semantics. * In 1972, logic programming and Prolog were developed thus allowing computer programs to be expressed as mathematical logic. * A team of scientists at Xerox PARC led by Alan Kay develop Smalltalk, an object-oriented language widely known for its innovative development environment. * In 1974, John C. Reynolds discovers System F. It had already been discovered in 1971 by the mathematical logician Jean-Yves Girard. * From 1975, Gerald Jay Sussman and Guy Steele develop the Scheme programming language, a Lisp dialect incorporating lexical scoping, a unified namespace, and elements from the actor model including first-class continuations. * Backus, at the 1977 ACM Turing Award lecture, assailed the current state of industrial languages and proposed a new class of programming languages now known as function-level programming languages. * In 1977, Gordon Plotkin introduces Programming Computable Functions, an abstract typed functional language. * In 1978, Robin Milner introduces the Hindley–Milner type inference algorithm for the ML programming language. Type theory became applied as a discipline to programming languages, this application has led to tremendous advances in type theory over the years. = 1980s = * In 1981, Gordon Plotkin publishes his paper on structured operational semantics. * In 1988, Gilles Kahn published his paper on natural semantics. * There emerged process calculi, such as the Calculus of Communicating Systems of Robin Milner, and the Communicating sequential processes model of C. A. R. Hoare, as well as similar models of concurrency such as the actor model of Carl Hewitt. * In 1985, the release of Miranda sparks an academic interest in lazy- evaluated pure functional programming languages. A committee was formed to define an open standard resulting in the release of the Haskell 1.0 standard in 1990. * Bertrand Meyer created the methodology Design by contract and incorporated it into the Eiffel programming language. = 1990s = * Gregor Kiczales, Jim Des Rivieres and Daniel G. Bobrow published the book The Art of the Metaobject Protocol. * Eugenio Moggi and Philip Wadler introduced the use of monads for structuring programs written in functional programming languages.  Sub-disciplines and related fields  There are several fields of study which either lie within programming language theory, or which have a profound influence on it; many of these have considerable overlap. In addition, PLT makes use of many other branches of mathematics, including computability theory, category theory, and set theory. = Formal semantics = Formal semantics is the formal specification of the behaviour of computer programs and programming languages. Three common approaches to describe the semantics or \\"meaning\\" of a computer program are denotational semantics, operational semantics and axiomatic semantics. = Type theory = Type theory is the study of type systems; which are \\"a tractable syntactic method for proving the absence of certain program behaviors by classifying phrases according to the kinds of values they compute\\".Benjamin C. Pierce. 2002. Types and Programming Languages. MIT Press, Cambridge, Massachusetts, USA. Many programming languages are distinguished by the characteristics of their type systems. = Program analysis and transformation = Program analysis is the general problem of examining a program and determining key characteristics (such as the absence of classes of program errors). Program transformation is the process of transforming a program in one form (language) to another form. = Comparative programming language analysis = Comparative programming language analysis seeks to classify programming languages into different types based on their characteristics; broad categories of programming languages are often known as programming paradigms. = Generic and metaprogramming = Metaprogramming is the generation of higher-order programs which, when executed, produce programs (possibly in a different language, or in a subset of the original language) as a result. = Domain-specific languages = Domain-specific languages are languages constructed to efficiently solve problems of a particular part of domain. = Compiler construction = Compiler theory is the theory of writing compilers (or more generally, translators); programs which translate a program written in one language into another form. The actions of a compiler are traditionally broken up into syntax analysis (scanning and parsing), semantic analysis (determining what a program should do), optimization (improving the performance of a program as indicated by some metric; typically execution speed) and code generation (generation and output of an equivalent program in some target language; often the instruction set of a CPU). = Run-time systems = Runtime systems refers to the development of programming language runtime environments and their components, including virtual machines, garbage collection, and foreign function interfaces.  Journals, publications, and conferences  Conferences are the primary venue for presenting research in programming languages. The most well known conferences include the Symposium on Principles of Programming Languages (POPL), Programming Language Design and Implementation (PLDI), the International Conference on Functional Programming (ICFP), the International Conference on Object Oriented Programming, Systems, Languages and Applications (OOPSLA) and the International Conference on Architectural Support for Programming Languages and Operating Systems (ASPLOS). Notable journals that publish PLT research include the ACM Transactions on Programming Languages and Systems (TOPLAS), Journal of Functional Programming (JFP), Journal of Functional and Logic Programming, and Higher-Order and Symbolic Computation.

This is opposite to combustion in a premixed flame. The fire breather's spurting of fuel (likely kerosene), combined with strong convection flows due to intense heat gives a turbulent diffusion flame. In combustion, a diffusion flame is a flame in which the oxidizer and fuel are separated before burning. Contrary to its name, a diffusion flame involves both diffusion and convection processes. The name diffusion flame was first suggested by S.P. Burke and T.E.W. Schumann in 1928Burke, S. P., and T. E. W. Schumann. \\"Diffusion flames.\\" Industrial & Engineering Chemistry 20.10 (1928): 998–1004., to differentiate from premixed flame where fuel and oxidizer are premixed prior to burning. The diffusion flame is also referred to as nonpremixed flame. The burning rate is however still limited by the rate of diffusion.https://inpressco.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/02/Paper28183-197.pdf. Diffusion flames tend to burn slower and to produce more soot than premixed flames because there may not be sufficient oxidizer for the reaction to go to completion, although there are some exceptions to the rule. The soot typically produced in a diffusion flame becomes incandescent from the heat of the flame and lends the flame its readily identifiable orange-yellow color. Diffusion flames tend to have a less-localized flame front than premixed flames. The contexts for diffusion may vary somewhat. For instance, a candle uses the heat of the flame itself to vaporize its wax fuel and the oxidizer (oxygen) diffuses into the flame from the surrounding air, while a gaslight flame (or the safety flame of a bunsen burner) uses fuel already in the form of a vapor. Diffusion flames are often studied in counter flow (also called opposed jet) burners. Their interest is due to possible application in the flamelet model for turbulent combustion. Furthermore they provide a convenient way to examine strained flames and flames with holes. These are also known under the name of \\"edge flames\\", characterized by a local extinction on their axis because of the high strain rates in the vicinity of the stagnation point. Diffusion flames have an entirely different appearance in a microgravity environment. There is no convection to carry the hot combustion products away from the fuel source, which results in a spherical flame front, such as in the candle seen here. This is a rare example of a diffusion flame which does not produce much soot and does not therefore have a typical yellow flame. File:Candleburning.jpgThe common flame of a candle is a classic example of a diffusion flame. The yellow color of the flame is due to the large number of incandescent soot particles in the incomplete combustion reaction of the flame.

The club is affiliated to the Surrey County Football Association. They are currently members of the and play at the Sports Pavilion. History They were established in 1893 and originally played in the Edenbridge & District League and the Surrey Junior league, at the same time. Before the First World War the club won the Edenbridge league six times and the Surrey Junior league once. After the War the club just competed in the Edenbridge league, as it had expanded and they could not play all of the fixtures for both leagues now. The club found more success in the Edenbridge league in the 1922–23 season, when they completed a double of League Champions and Edenbridge Hospital Cup. The next season saw the club join the Redhill and District League, but just two seasons later saw them again simultaneously compete in the Edenbridge League again, and winning it again in the 1929–30 campaign. At the end of the 1930–31 season the club left both leagues to join the East Grinstead league, which they won at the first attempt. However, after one more season the club left the league and joined the newly formed Edenbridge and Caterham League. They then went on to win the league in the 1934–35 campaign, and successfully defended this title for the next two seasons. In 1938 the club had to move from their ground at High Street to a new ground at Talbot Road, as the local council wanted the land to build a school. After the Second World War the club rejoined the Edenbridge and Caterham League, and winning another title in the 1952–53 season. Three seasons later the club was back in the Redhill and District league, and gaining promotion to the Premier Division of that league in the 1958–59 season, the first season at their new home of Godstone Road. The club remained in the Premier Division until the end of the 1969–70 campaign, when they were relegated back to Division one. It took the club just two seasons to become champions of Division one, but instead of being promoted to the Premier Division the club decided to join the Surrey Intermediate League. Success in the Surrey Intermediate league came under the management of Dennis Moore, when in the 1976–77 season they gained Promotion from the Premier division 'B' to the Premier Division 'A' as champions. Further success followed the next season as they took the Premier Division 'A' title as well as winning the Surrey County Centenary Cup and the league cup. The club repeated the league and league cup double success again at the end of the 1978–79 campaign. During the 1979–80 Campaign the club applied to the Sussex County League and the Combined Counties Football League, but were turned down by their first choice the Sussex league, as their ground was considered inadequate. However the Combined Counties league accepted the application and the club joined the league for the 1980–81 campaign. In their second season in the Combined Counties league the league was split into an east and west section, and the club finished runners-up in the Eastern section. The next season saw the club make their debut in the FA Vase where they were knocked out by Southwick 7–0 in the Preliminary qualifying round. The 1982–83 season also saw the club install floodlights at their ground, which enabled the club to join division two of the Sussex County League for the 1983–84 season. Their Third season in the Sussex County league saw the club finish bottom of Division two and relegated to Division Three. The club would then finish bottom of Division Three for the next three seasons. Their application to remain in the league after the third consecutive bottom finish was rejected, and the club were relegated to the Mid-Sussex Football League. The club stayed in the Mid Sussex football league, until the end of the 1992–93 campaign, when they gained promotion back to Division three of the Sussex league under manager Dennis Moore. Their first season back in the Sussex County league saw the team finish runners-up in Division three and gain promotion to Division two. Howerver the following season they were straight back in Division three after finishing bottom of division two. It took the club another three seasons to get back up to division two and this time as champions. Two seasons later in the 1999-00 campaign the club finished bottom of Division two, but were spared relegation as several clubs left the league and two merged. However the following season another bottom finish and the club was back in Division three. In the 2005–06 season, they were runners-up of the Division Three, earning promotion to Division Two. In season 2007–08 Lingfield were promoted to Sussex County Division One, under the management of Steve Perkins Jnr, when they finished as runners-up. Their first season in Division one saw the club enter the FA Cup for the first time, where they met Arundel in the extra preliminary qualifying round, but progressed no further after losing 3–0.

Once a small fishing village, the town is now known for its beaches and has increased in popularity since gaining international attention around 2000 while retaining an eco-friendly appeal. History The region was the landing point of the Portuguese explorer, Pedro Alvares Cabral onto Brazil, on April 22, 1500. It was founded by Jesuit Priests in 1583, with the name São João Baptista dos Indios. Development of the beach town accelerated in 1999, when a highway opened linking to Trancoso to Porto Seguro, a commercial hub that has an airport. Artist Solange Ferrarini, created a distinctive crochet bikini which was first sold on the beaches of Trancoso and later copied as a kiini. Geography Shaped as a rectangle, the village retains the original style of its housing architecture. It is famous for its beaches, such as Praia dos Nativos, Praia dos Coqueiros and Praia do Espelho. In recent years the location has been developed by the hotel industry, including the French Club Méditerranée, which has boosted real estate value. The main square is known as 'Quadrado', although it is rectangular. To its east is a sixteenth-century Catholic Church, São João Batista, dedicated to Saint John, the Baptist. The federal Ministry of the Environment is currently expanding several National Parks and Natural Reserves nearby with the goal of preserving remaining areas of Atlantic Rain Forest. In addition, Trancoso is located at the starting point of a state Environmental Protection Area, the APA Caraíva-Trancoso, whose goal is to curtail touristic and economical development in the region, thereby minimizing negative impacts that may harm this biosphere. Festivals On January 20, the 'Quadrado' is the site of a festival honoring Saint Sebastian, during which the locals sing and play drums and guitars. The main verse is: \\"São Sebastião, hoje chegou o dia. Vimos festejar com toda a alegria!\\" (Saint Sebastian, your day has arrived. We have come to joyfully celebrate it!) Demography As in most of Brazil, the population is a mixture of native, African and Portuguese or other European descendants. In recent years, \\"winter birds\\" such as Canadians, Italians, Portuguese, Dutch, Greeks, Israeli, and other have purchased homes, bed and breakfast, restaurants, and stores here or in other Porto Seguro sections, such as Arraial d'Ajuda and eventually settled down in Trancoso. Attractions The Quadrado, or main square, is bordered by colorful houses and a white little church overseeing the Atlantic Ocean. The Quadrado, its colorful houses and church are UNESCO protected. The main attraction of Trancoso are the white sandy beaches with natural swimming pools formed by reefs at low tide. Most of them are protected by reefs and form natural swimming pools at low tide. = Praia do Espelho (Mirror Beach) = This beach has powder white sand and natural warm swimming pools created by reefs at low tide. Praia do Espelho is situated about a half an hour from Trancoso, following a winding dirt road that is only accessible during sunny weather. = Praia dos Coqueiros (Palmtree Beach)= Praia dos Coqueiros, or Palmtree Beach, is a small beach with medium waves and most of the time protected by coral reefs. This beach has the nickname Palmtree beach because of the more than hundred palmtrees that are typical for this region of Bahia. = Praia da Pedra Grande (Big Rock Beach)= This beach is about a kilometer away from Praia Coqueiros, it's narrower than the other beaches and with fewer tourists. Praia Dos Coqueiros is the last beach where you will find restaurants, beachbars and some beach hotels. The more distant beaches are deserted and known locally as beaches to practice surfing and topless sunbathing. =Praia dos Nativos (Local beach)= Praias dos Nativos has beach bars and beach hotels.

Composed and produced by Martin O'Donnell and Michael Salvatori for Bungie, the soundtrack was released on June 11, 2002. Most of the music from Halo: Combat Evolved is present on the CD, although some songs have been remixed by O'Donnell in medley form for \\"more enjoyable\\" listening. The first piece O'Donnell wrote, known as \\"Halo\\", became the basis for Halos \\"signature sound\\" which has been heard in the other games of the main trilogy. The soundtrack features a wide range of musical styles, including chanting, string orchestra, and percussion. Upon release, the soundtrack was well received by critics. Some complimented the wide range of musical styles, and most agreed that playing the game is not required to enjoy the soundtrack. A special edition of the soundtrack was released on October 28, 2003, featuring a DVD with a trailer, demo movie, and high quality music for Halo 2. Background As the audio director for Bungie, Martin O'Donnell was tasked with writing the music for Halo: Combat Evolved. He had scored previous Bungie projects, including Myth: The Fallen Lords, while working for his audio company, TotalAudio, along with Michael Salvatori. O'Donnell was nervous about the project, saying he approached it, \\"with fear and trepidation\\". O'Donnell stated his main influences were music he liked—\\"a little Samuel Barber meets Giorgio Moroder\\". Bungie's Director of cinematics, Joseph Staten told O'Donnell, \\"the music should give a feeling of importance, weight, and sense of the 'ancient' to the visuals of Halo\\". O'Donnell's first piece of music, \\"Halo\\", which would become \\"the signature theme for Halo\\", was written and recorded in three days. O'Donnell convinced Alex Seropian to allow him to produce an original piece of music for the game's 1999 Macworld Conference & Expo demonstration. He drew inspiration for the theme from The Beatles' \\"Yesterday\\". O'Donnell recruited Salvatori and three other colleagues he had recorded jingles with—Robert Bowker, Jeffrey Morrow, and Rob Trow—to produce the \\"chanting monks\\" that open the piece. Originally, he had intended the Qawwali accents to be sung by one of the professionals, but after singing an example of what he wanted, the others suggested using O'Donnell's own rendition instead. The theme premiered at the 1999 Macworld Conference & Expo. The remaining themes were written, recorded, and produced throughout 2001. The music was written with a variety of equipment including, \\"keyboards, synths, and samplers as well as digital recording equipment controlled by computers\\". Live instrumentations, from members of the Chicago Symphony and Chicago Lyric Opera Orchestra, were added where needed. The soundtrack features a wide range of sounds, O'Donnell described it as, \\"Gregorian chant, string orchestra, percussion and just a bit of a 'Qawwali voice'\\". Working closely with level designers, O'Donnell divided the music \\"into chunks\\". Based on these \\"chunks\\", \\"[Halo's] audio engine could play [the music] back dynamically based on the player's actions\\". For the soundtrack release, O'Donnell rearranged the music featured in the game in order to make listening to the soundtrack \\"more enjoyable\\". Bungie had previously released soundtracks for their games due to fan request, but Microsoft was hesitant to commit to producing a soundtrack for Halo; at the time most video games did not get a commercial soundtrack release. The publisher finally relented after pressure from O'Donnell and the outside solicitation of musician Nile Rodgers. Reception Reception of the soundtrack was generally positive from critics. IGN praised the soundtrack for its wide use of instruments stating, \\"Where other videogame scores tend to miss their mark when combining electronic and organic elements, O'Donnell and Salvatori seem to have found a rather stable balance between the two divergent sounds.\\" Adding, overall, the soundtrack is \\"one of the better videogame oriented musical experiences out there\\" and playing the game is not required to find enjoyment within the score. Reviewing for Monsters At Play, Michael Johnson called the soundtrack \\"66 minutes of orchestral goodness\\" citing the wide range of music covered as a strong point. Nuketown gave the soundtrack 9 out of 10, stating, \\"the soundtrack is a welcome and invigorating reminder of good times had blasting unstoppable alien hordes\\". The release went on to sell over 40,000 copies.Traiman, Steve (November 3, 2004) 'Halo 2' soundtrack boasts Incubus, Hoobastank. Houston Chronicle. Retrieved 2012-02-29.

Also featured that day were Roy Brown and his Orchestra, Don Tosti and His Mexican Jazzmen, Earl Bostic, Nat \\"King\\" Cole, and Shorty Rogers and his Orchestra.“Satchmo Band Spice To Open Air Show” Article Los Angeles Sentinel May 28, 1953. He married Francice Netcher, elder sister of socialite Mollie Wilmot. The couple had four children – Nina, Maria, Terasa, and Christina. They lived in Santa Barbara, California, on a ranch. His best-known composition might be \\"Oh! Look at Me Now\\", with John DeVries, written when he worked in Tommy Dorsey's band. That song would become Frank Sinatra's second hit and one of his most enduring songs right after \\"Polkadots & Moonbeams.\\" One of Bushkin's television appearances was on a thirty-minute Judy Garland musical special produced for the General Electric Theater which aired on April 8, 1956 on the CBS Television Network. According to Coyne Steven Sanders, author of the book Rainbow's End: The Judy Garland Show, Bushkin was a last- minute replacement for the classic pianist Leonard Pennario. On that program, he accompanied Garland on piano as she sang the songs Last Night When We Were Young and Life Is Just a Bowl of Cherries. (Sanders, Coyne Steven, Rainbow's End: The Judy Garland Show pgs. 20-21 - Zebra Books - Kensington Publishing Company). In his 60s, Bushkin's semi-retirement was ended by an offer from Bing Crosby for them to tour together in 1976 and 1977; Bushkin also appeared on Crosby's 1975 Christmas TV special with Fred Astaire. He also performed in a concert series at New York's St. Regis hotel in 1984 that celebrated his 50 years in show business. Bushkin died in Santa Barbara, California, in 2004. \\"He had hoped to live to 88, as a piano had 88 keys.\\" Discography * 1950 I Love a Piano (Atlantic) * 1950 Piano Moods - Joe Bushkin (Columbia) * 1951 After Hours with Joe Bushkin (Columbia) * 1954 Piano and Rhythm (Royal) * 1955 The Jazz Keyboards with Lennie Tristano, Marian McPartland, Bobby Scott (Savoy) * 1956 A Fellow Needs a Girl (Capitol) * 1956 Midnight Rhapsody (Capitol) * 1956 At Twilight with Eddie Heywood (Epic) * 1957 Skylight Rhapsody (Capitol) * 1957 Bushkin Spotlights Berlin (Capitol) * 1958 Blue Angels (Capitol) * 1958 Nightsounds (Capitol) * 1958 I Get a Kick Out of Porter (Capitol) * 1958 Piano After Midnight with Buck Clayton (Fontana) * 1959 Listen to the Quiet (Capitol) * 1964 In Concert, Town Hall (Reprise) * 1966 Night Sounds San Francisco with Marty Paich (Decca) * 1977 Play It Again Joe (United Artists) * 1979 The World Is Waiting with Mel Powell (Commodore) With Ruth Brown *Ruth Brown (Atlantic, 1957) External links * Joe Bushkin Interview NAMM Oral History Library (1999) References Category:1916 births Category:2004 deaths Category:American jazz pianists Category:American male pianists Category:20th-century American pianists Category:20th-century American male musicians Category:American male jazz musicians ","title":"Joe Bushkin"},{"id":"3882291","text":"Newhaven Football Club is a football club based in Newhaven, East Sussex, England.

Map of Ohio watersheds The name alludes to the reddish clay that is the predominant local soil along its route. The river is commonly muddy after rains. The river receives returns of stocked steelhead trout from the ODNR each fall through spring. This is the westernmost river, in Ohio, that the ODNR stocks yearly with steelhead trout. During the end of spring the fish return to lake Erie for the summer and will return to the river in the fall. The river is also home to smallmouth bass, largemouth bass, rock bass, channel catfish, bullhead, longnose gar, various suckers, bluegill, sunfish, carp, crappie, freshwater drum, various minnows and darters, crayfish, and a variety of aquatic insects. Course The Vermilion River flows from Mud Lake in the town of Bailey Lakes in Ashland County and follows a generally northward course through Huron, Erie and Lorain counties, past the towns of Savannah and Wakeman. It enters Lake Erie in Erie County at the city of Vermilion.DeLorme (1991). Ohio Atlas & Gazetteer. Yarmouth, Maine: DeLorme. A short distance before the river enters Lake Erie, near State Route 2, it passes through a deep gorge. The Vermilion rest area along the northern (westbound) side of Route 2 features a short nature trail leading to an overview of the gorge. A major archaeological site, known as the Franks Site, sits atop the gorge walls; it was once a large village of the Erie tribe.Vietzen, Raymond C. The Immortal Eries. Elyria: Wilmot, 1945, 41. Three short tributaries are known as branches or forks of the Vermilion River. The Southwest Branch Vermilion River and the East Branch Vermilion River join the Vermilion in Huron County. The East Fork Vermilion River rises in Lorain County and joins the Vermilion in Erie County. Variant names The United States Board on Geographic Names settled on \\"Vermilion River\\" as the stream's official name in 1899. According to the Geographic Names Information System, the Vermilion River has also been known as: *Oulame Thepy *Vermillion River *River en Grys History The Vermilion River (formerly spelled \\"Vermillion\\"- double 'L') has been known by that name since at least 1760 in explorer George Croghan's journal, and was also recorded by that name in Montressor's 1764 journal of the Bradstreet expedition; and its location is denoted correctly on a 1778 map by Hutchins. In Croghan's 1760 journal, he records this river as also named \\"Oulame Thepy\\", which was his own phonetic interpretation of one of the Native-American tribes' names for it. \\"Thepy\\"(or \\"sepe\\"/\\"sipi\\") was a Native word for 'river' or 'creek'; and \\"Oulame\\" may translate directly as 'paint' -- this River seems to be referred to as \\"Paint Creek\\" by later 18th- century European inhabitants —- it is said that the local Native-Americans used the purplish-red clay from along this river, as a sort of paint on their bodies (by mixing it with bright red berry juices). But the name \\"Vermillion\\" undoubtedly was an attribution by the first European explorers here, who apparently presumed that the red clay-and-berry mixture was the same as the substance (and highly valuable European commodity) 'vermillion' -- and although the native's body-paint really instead turned out to be made from worthless brownish-purple mud, but the name \\"vermillion\\" stuck anyway. [source, Diary (1787–1791) of David Zeisberger, (publ.1885 by Robert Clarke and Co., Cinti.)] The prior spelling for this river was \\"Vermillion\\" (double 'L') until about the end of the 19th-century, when the double 'L' was dropped, reportedly due to the spelling conflict with nearby Ashland County's township of 'Vermillion' (which is not upon this river). But an urban-myth circulating in the city of Vermilion in the early 1970s claims that the name \\"Vermillion\\" lost its second 'L' because it was more expensive to paint two L's on the water tower. Although the Geographic Names Server also listed (erroneously) the \\"River en Grys\\" as an alternate name for the Vermilion River and also (erroneously) for the Black River, but actually that name (\\"Riviere en Grys\\") was originally intended for what is now called Beaver Creek, which is in between these two rivers. [The \\"Riviere en Grys\\" appears on Hutchins 1778 map, east of the \\"Vermillion River\\" and west of the \\"Reneshoua\\"(the Black River).] See also *List of rivers of Ohio *Vermilion, Ohio References External links *Vermilion River Property Rights Association Category:Rivers of Ohio Category:Rivers of Ashland County, Ohio Category:Rivers of Erie County, Ohio Category:Rivers of Huron County, Ohio Category:Rivers of Lorain County, Ohio Category:Tributaries of Lake Erie ","title":"Vermilion River (Ohio)"},{"id":"3882311","title":"Michele J.

The distribution uniformity is often calculated when performing an irrigation audit. The DU should not be confused with the coefficient of uniformity (CU) which is often preferred for describing the performance of overhead pressurized systems. The most common measure of DU is the low quarter DU expressed as DUlq, which is a measure of the average of the lowest quarter of samples, divided by the average of all samples. The higher the DUlq, the better the coverage of the area measured. If all samples are equal, the DUlq is 1.0. There is no universal value of DUlq for satisfactory system performance. A value of >.80 is considered above average. Distribution uniformity may be helpful as a starting point for irrigation scheduling. For example, an irrigator might want to apply not less than one inch of water to the area being watered. If the DU were 0.75, then the total amount to be applied would be the desired amount of water, divided by the DU. In this case, the required irrigation would be 1.33 inches of water, so that only a very small area received less than one inch. The lower the DU, the less uniform the distribution at the plane of data collection and the more water that may be needed to meet the minimum requirement. Catchments are commonly used to determine sprinkler DU and one must be reminded that data collection most often occurs above grade and above the root zone where plant uptake normally occurs. Many factors may affect water distribution or redistribution between catchment plane and root zone; slope, plant canopy, thatch, mulch, infiltration rate, etc.. Soil type and root horizon may nullify the need for high DUlq sprinklers. Low sprinkler DUlq does not guarantee inefficiency, nor does high DUlq guarantee efficiency. An alternative is Christiansen's uniformity coefficient (CU), defined as the average depth of irrigation water applied minus the average absolute deviation from this depth, all divided by the average depth applied (ASAE, 1998). http://ufdcimages.uflib.ufl.edu/UF/00/00/85/33/00001/00010.pdf References Category:Irrigation ","title":"Distribution uniformity"},{"id":"3882405","text":"Republic Day celebrations on Sudder Street Sudder Street is a street in Central Kolkata and famous for cheap hotels.

It is well known how Rabindranath came to write his profoundly moving long poem \\"Nirjharer Swapnabhanga\\" in a fit of sudden illumination that had all the qualities of an epiphany. in the morning at Sudder Street, Rabindranath had a joyful feeling. His sorrows had been totally removed by the morning sun rays coming from all the directions.

They were of 4-6-2 \\"Pacific\\" wheel arrangement in the Whyte notation, or 2′C1′ h2 in the UIC classification. The idea of standardisation was that it would reduce maintenance costs; i.e. if a BR 01 whose engine shop was in, say, Berlin broke down in Dresden, instead of having to ship the necessary part from Berlin and take the locomotive out of service, a part from the Dresden shop could be used as all of the engines, parts, and workings were exactly the same and produced nationwide. Thus it was a \\"standard\\" product for engine shops. History Frankfurt am Main-Nied in the year 1938 Manufacturer's plate of 01 118 of the Frankfurt Historic Railway The firms of AEG and Borsig, who were the main manufacturers of these engines, together with Henschel, Hohenzollern, Krupp and BMAG previously Schwartzkopff, delivered a total of 231 examples of this Einheitsdampflokomotive between 1926 and 1938 for the fast passenger services of the Deutsche Reichsbahn. To begin with, 10 locomotives of this class were built with two-cylinder engines for comparison purposes alongside a similar batch of 10 engines of their sister Class 02, which had four-cylinder compounding. Extensive measurement and trial runs were conducted, but after lengthy discussions the controversial decision finally fell in favour of the two-cylinder configuration, which was simpler to maintain but less powerful and less economical than the four-cylinder compounds. The first Class 01 locomotive that went into service was not 01 001, but 01 008, which is preserved today in the Bochum-Dahlhausen Railway Museum. The mass production of Class 01s was somewhat delayed at first because in the 1920s there were neither enough routes with the necessary axle load of 20 tons nor sufficiently large turntables. Not until the beginning of the 1930s did the Class 01 become the predominant express train locomotive of the Deutsche Reichsbahn. By 1938 there were 231 Class 01 locomotives available for the prestigious express train duties. Another 10 four-cylinder Class 02 locomotives (01 111, 01 233–241) were converted to two-cylinder Class 01 models between 1937 and 1942. To accommodate for the many routes with axle load restrictions too low for Class 01 service, in the early 1930s, a third variant was created: the Class 03 designed with a two-cylinder engine and axle load of 18 ton, of which no less than 298 were built. Launched in 1939, the three-cylinder DRG Class 01.10 was a further development of the 01. A total of five series or batches were delivered, each with minor variations: 01 001–010 (1926), 01 112–076 (1927–28), 01 077–101 (1930–31), 01 102–190 (1934–1936), 01 191–232 (1937–1938). Even in the 1930s the employment of Class 01s was limited to the relatively few routes that had already been modified to take a 20-ton axle load. From Berlin outwards they were the Anhalt, Lehrte and Hamburg lines. The Berlin City Railway had first to be strengthened by reinforcing the viaduct arches. Up to 1930, the first 90 engines were stationed at the locomotive depots of Essen, Nuremberg, Erfurt P, Berlin Ahb, Hamm, Magdeburg Hbf, Kassel, Hanover, Hamburg Altona, Bebra and Offenburg. From 1931 they were also stabled at Frankfurt (M) 1, Berlin Leb, Braunschweig, Berlin Pog, Schneidemühl, Königsberg, Göttingen P, Paderborn, Dresden Alt, Breslau, Cologne Deutzerfeld, Hof and Halle P. Locomotive 01 118 of the Frankfurt Historic Railway View of the driver's cab on locomotive 01 008 Originally, the Class 01's top speed was restricted to 120 km/h. In order to raise this to 130 km/h, the diameter of the leading wheels was changed from its original 850 mm to 1,000 mm on locomotives from operating number 01 102 onwards and brake effort was increased by installing double-sided working of the brake shoes on the coupled wheels and by braking the trailing wheels. The air and feed pumps were located in smokebox recesses behind the large Wagner smoke deflectors, which had been fitted from 01 077 onwards. (Earlier models were also refitted with Wagner type deflectors later). This made access to the pumps for maintenance purposes more difficult and later Einheitsloks had their pumps located in the middle of the vehicle on delivery. The Deutsche Bundesbahn converted their engines to the smaller Witte smoke deflectors and moved the pumps to the running board in the centre of the vehicle. The Deutsche Reichsbahn in East Germany shied away from such major changes to the load distribution, so that only minor modifications in appearance can be seen even in their last years. From the third series (01 077 et seq.) the boilers were delivered with longer smoke tubes and thus a shorter firebox. All engines originally had a central lock for the smokebox door. The first locomotives had gas lighting on delivery; from 01 010 they had electrical lighting and the last few batches were given a third headlight. The Class 01s were equipped with 2'2 T 30, 2'2' T 32 or 2'2' T 34 tenders. Their coal capacity was 10 tons of stone coal, and the water tank held either 30, 32 or 34 cubic metres of water. The prototype locomotives, 01 001 to 01 010, were supplied with the smaller 2'2 T 30 tenders, because there were not enough large turntables around. Later these tenders were only used if they were absolutely necessary, e.g. in cross-border services with the Netherlands. From the second series (01 012 et seq.) on, the Class 01 was furnished with rivetted 2'2' T 32 tenders. The welded tenders, class 2'2' T 34, appeared only by way of exchange (mainly from brand new Class 44) locomotives. Thereafter they were almost the only ones used during the war years and after the Second World War, because they had a larger water capacity. Class 01 locomotives remained in service with the Deutsche Bundesbahn until 1973. In the DR, they were still working up to the early 1980s, largely in their original state with large smoke deflectors. They were legendary in their last years for hauling the D-Zug services on the Berlin- Dresden route up to autumn 1977. Only when the large Soviet DR Class 132 diesel locomotives arrived, the Class 01 express train locomotives were finally forced out of scheduled services in the GDR after almost 50 years. Rebuilds = Rebuilds 1950 to 1957 (DB) = In 1950 and 1951, the Deutsche Bundesbahn converted locomotives 01 042, 01 046, 01 112, 01 154 and 01 192\\\\. They were enhanced with a Heinl mixer preheater by Henschel and a turbo feed pump. In addition combustion chambers were installed in the boilers. Finally the conversion was rounded off with the replacement of the original smoke deflectors by Witte deflectors, which in spite of their considerably smaller size were just as effective as their larger predecessors. Four of the five modified locomotives remained in service until 1968. =Rebuilds 1957 to 1961 (new DB boiler)= From 1957 the Deutsche Bundesbahn rebuilt a further 50 vehicles. These engines were given welded, high-performance, steam boilers, which had already been used on the DRG Class 01.10. In addition a new mixer preheater system was installed in the smokebox and numerous friction bearings were replaced by roller bearings. Changes to the cylinder block, running board, a shorter chimney, front apron (Frontschürze) and locomotive frame, as well as the missing feedwater dome, all gave the locomotives a different external appearance. Reboilered 01 class near Hof at Easter 1972. =DR Reko locomotive 01.5= Rekolok 01 519 From 1962, the Reichsbahn repair shop (Reichsbahnausbesserungswerk) at Meiningen rebuilt 35 Class 01 engines for the DR under the direction of the research and trials division VES-M Halle. Like the DB, they selected only those locomotives with more powerful brakes (from 01 102). All these locos were fitted with new Witte smoke deflectors with tapered edges, a new driver's cab and a new boiler, positioned higher on the frame. The boiler had a combustion chamber, a mixer preheater and a continuous cover for the dome. Preserved locomotives 01 118 at Bahnhofsfest Königstein Pfingsten 2007 seen from front above 01 118 at Bahnhofsfest Königstein Pfingsten 2007 seen from back above Lindau Hbf =Operational locomotives= Only a few locomotives of the original design have been preserved unchanged over the course of time. Of the two-cylinder Class 01 engines, the following are currently operational: * 01 118, built in 1934, is the only one to have been operational without interruption until today. After the war it was in service with the DR; since 1981 it has belonged to the Historic Railway, Frankfurt (Historische Eisenbahn Frankfurt). From its base in Frankfurt Osthafen it is regularly used for museum services, including on the Frankfurt Harbour Railway (Frankfurter Hafenbahn). * Another operational locomotive of this class is 01 066, built in 1928 by Schwartzkopff and which was on duty with the Deutsche Reichsbahn until 1977. Thereafter it was used as a heating engine until 1989 in the VEB Genthin washing powder factory in Nauen. The Bavarian Railway Museum in Nördlingen rebuilt the partly preserved locomotive in the Meiningen Steam Locomotive Works from individual components from other locomotives, including those of other classes – and put it back in service in summer 1993. * The third operational locomotive is 01 202, that is worked by the Verein Pacific 01 202 in Switzerland. This loco was last in service with the DB and had Witte smoke deflectors. It has retained its original boiler, but lost the front apron. After its retirement in 1975, the engine was rebuilt again over 20 years with great initiative and made operational again. It was given a red livery stripe on the tender at the height of the running plate. * Locomotive 01 116, which was built in 1934 with factory no. 1413 by Krupp and rebuilt in 1964/65 at RAW Meiningen, runs today as 01 533 with ÖGEG in Austria. * 01 150 – DB Museum locomotive in DB configuration with Witte smoke deflectors. A new DLW Meiningen boiler was installed in 2012. On 17 October 2005 it was badly damaged by the great fire at the Nuremberg/Gostenhof locomotive depot. After inspecting the badly damaged steam engine at DLW Meiningen, DB AG initially intended just to carry out a cosmetic refurbishment; but after a donation marathon initiated by the last engine driver, Olaf Teubert, who collected nearly € 1M within two years, a full operational restoration was enabled from 2011 to 2012. Since May 2013 the restored steam engine has been made operationally ready for use on the German railway network again. * 01 1075 is currently in running order but out of service in a Dutch steam organisation called SSN. This is the only 01 class which is allowed to run both in The Netherlands and Germany without any supplemental diesel/electric locomotive. =Non-operational locomotives= In addition there are several Class 01 and 01.5 locomotives that have been preserved as non-operational exhibits: * 01 005 – Dresden Transport Museum, ex-DR, largely in original configuration * 01 008 – Bochum-Dahlhausen Railway Museum (the first 01 in service), in DB configuration (Witte smoke deflectors, original boiler) * 01 111 – German Steam Locomotive Museum Neuenmarkt (not operational), largely in original configuration * 01 137 – DB Museum locomotive, largely in original configuration 001 150-2 waits to leave Regensburg with a train for Hof, August 1973. * 01 164 – German Steam Locomotive Museum Neuenmarkt, in DB configuration (Witte smoke deflectors, original boiler) * 01 173 – Privately owned, on loan to the Deutsches Technikmuseum Berlin, in DB configuration (Witte smoke deflectors, original boiler) * 01 204 – Privately owned, largely in original configuration * 01 220 – Monument locomotive in Treuchtlingen, DB Museum locomotive, in DB configuration (Witte smoke deflectors, new DB boiler) * 01 509 (ex 01 143) - Ulm Railway Friends (oil-fired, currently in for repairs at Meiningen Steam Locomotive Works due to boiler damage. * 01 514 (ex 01 208) - Technik Museum Speyer * 01 519 (ex 01 186) - Eisenbahnfreunde Zollernbahn * 01 531 (ex 01 158) - Nuremberg Transport Museum; museum loco at Arnstadt locomotive depot, currently not operational.

In this capacity he led a team of approximately fifty analysts who developed quantitative models to support energy trading. In the months preceding Enron’s bankruptcy Kaminski repeatedly raised strong objections to the financial practices of Enron’s Chief Financial Officer, Andrew Fastow, designed to fraudulently conceal the company’s burgeoning debt. The primary practice involved hiding Enron’s debt in partnership companies managed by Fastow and financed by outside creditors. The debt was then secured against stock in the Enron Corporation itself, which was strongly valued at that time. To induce creditors to assume the risk of financing this debt certain \\"trigger events\\" were built into the contracts which would require immediate repayment of the full loan amount, such as the decline of the stock value used as collateral below a prearranged level. During the course of a company-wide comprehensive risk assessment Kaminski and his team of analysts pointed out that there existed many such arrangements, and if one were triggered the rest would be activated like dominoes as the stock price fell in response to the bad news, effectively ending the financial viability of the company. Kaminski’s strident opposition to these practices was one of the last chances to avert the implosion which soon followed. Dr. Kaminski holds an M.S. degree in International Economics and a Ph.D. degree in Mathematical Economics from the Main School of Planning and Statistics in Warsaw (which has since been renamed Warsaw School of Economics), and an MBA from Fordham University in New York City.

James Ray Dixon (born August 1, 1928, in Houston, Texas – died January 10, 2015, in Bryan, Texas) was professor emeritus and curator emeritus of amphibians and reptiles at the Texas Cooperative Wildlife Collection at Texas A&M; University. He lived in El Campo, Texas throughout most of his childhood. He published prolifically on the subject of herpetology in his distinguished career, authoring and co- authoring several books, book chapters, and numerous peer reviewed notes and articles, describing two new genera, and many new species, earning him a reputation as one of the most prominent herpetologists of his generation. His main research focus was morphology based systematics of amphibians and reptiles worldwide with emphasis on Texas, US, Mexico, Central America, and South America, although bibliographies, conservation, ecology, life history and zoogeography have all been the subjects of his extensive publications. Eponyms A genus of lizards, Dixonius , leaf-toed geckos from Southeast Asia, was named in his honor as well as several species of reptiles and amphibians, e.g., the white-lipped peeping frog, Eleutherodactylus dixoni (= Eleutherodactylus albolabris ); the gray checkered whiptail, Cnemidophorus dixoni (= Aspidoscelis tesselatus ); Dixon's leaf-toed gecko, Phyllodactylus dixoni ; and the large-eyed snake, Thamnodynastes dixoni .Beolens, Bo; Watkins, Michael; Grayson, Michael (2011).

Upon returning from the war, he briefly acted as Curator of Reptiles at the Ross Allen Reptile Institute from 1954 to 1955. He earned his master's degree (1957) and PhD in (1961) from Texas A&M; University. He was an associate professor of veterinary medicine at Texas A&M; from 1959 until 1961. Career From 1961 until 1965 he was an associate professor of wildlife management at New Mexico State University and served as a consultant to the New Mexico state Game and Fisheries department. He was on the faculty of the University of Southern California and from 1965 until 1967 he was Curator of Herpetology at the Life Sciences Division at the Los Angeles County Museum in California. In 1967 he returned to Texas to become a professor at Texas A&M; University, teaching wildlife and fisheries science, and curator of the Texas Cooperative Wildlife Collection or TCWC (recently renamed Biodiversity Research and Teaching Collections or BRTC). Over 20 herpetologists earned Ph.D.s studying under him at Texas A&M; University. He has also served as president of several herpetological and naturalist societies including The Herpetologist League, Texas Herpetological Society, Texas Academy of Science; Society for the Study of Amphibians and Reptiles, Southwestern Association of Naturalists, and on the board of directors of the Texas Systems of Natural Laboratories.

It has been manufactured by S. C. Johnson & Son, since their purchase of Drackett from Bristol-Myers Squibb in October 1992. The original product—an aerosol oven cleaner—was developed at Drackett in 1986. The Mr Muscle product lineup has since expanded. Oven cleaner =History= Oven cleaners at the time of introduction (1986) were generally similar to Reckitt & Colman's Easy-Off, the leading brand. A strong base, such as caustic soda, attacked grease by saponification. Surfactants attacked both grease and food spills. An abrasive may be present to help scour the oven. The product worked better if the oven was hot, although working in a fairly close space with hot oven cleaner fumes was unpleasant. Appliance manufacturers offered continuous clean ovens, which had a special coating. Consumers, however, discovered these ovens were rarely cleaned by the process. Additionally, supplemental use of chemical cleaners destroyed the special coating that enabled continuous clean to function. Manufacturers next offered self-cleaning ovens, which allows the oven to run at a special high temperature setting, effectively burning food residue to ash. Early self- cleaning ovens were not thoroughly satisfactory. At worst, they left carbon stuck to the oven surfaces. At best, they left carbon residue on the oven floor. Industry legend has it that Drackett researchers, while trying to find a cold oven cleaner, found that ammonia would plasticize food spills, making them easier to remove. This took hours, however, during which period the ammonia would evaporate, halting the process. Looking for a less volatile chemical with the general characteristics of ammonia, they found that monoethanolamine had similar properties. Monoethanolamine is a weak base, so it required the addition of caustic soda as well as surfactants and bentonite as a mild abrasive. Like most household cleaning aerosols, the propellant is a blend of propane and isobutane. Because the product required significant time to work properly, it was marketed as an overnight oven cleaner. The product quickly grew to be the second best selling oven cleaner. The product's popularity was limited by the strong fumes it created, as well as the length of time required to thoroughly clean. Consumers were not thrilled at the prospect of awakening in the morning to the task of wiping chemicals, carbon, and grease out of their ovens. =Controversy= In September 1994, there was some controversy regarding Mr Muscle, after complaints over the potency of the cleaning agents within the product, which were thought to be unnecessarily high and of a level that could lead to potential health problems. The study in the United Kingdom by the Welsh Regional Burns and Plastics Unit, Chepstow found: The United States Department of Health and Human Services (HHS), which lists household product information for health and safety, lists the Health & Effects information taken from the Mr Muscle product label and/or the Material Safety Data Sheet (MSDS) prepared by the product manufacturer. Mr Muscle is rated as a scale 3 (serious) for Health and a 4 (severe) for Flammability (using the established HMIS, Hazardous Materials Identification System). Other hard surface cleaners The brand includes other hard surface cleaners. Products include bathroom and toilet cleaning, glass and surface cleaners, floor cleaners and polishes, kitchen cleaners and degreasers, and more. These products are sold in Europe, Asia, Latin America, and Africa under the brand names Mr Muscle or Mr. Musculo. S. C. Johnson also sells similar products in other parts of the world under the Duck and Scrubbing Bubbles brands.

There are over 730 SNOTEL (or snow telemetry) sites in 11 states, including Alaska. The sites are generally located in remote high-mountain watersheds where access is often difficult or restricted. Access for maintenance by the NRCS includes various modes from hiking and skiing to helicopters. All SNOTEL sites measure snow water content, accumulated precipitation, and air temperature. Some sites also measure snow depth, soil moisture and temperature, wind speed, solar radiation, humidity, and atmospheric pressure. These data are used to forecast yearly water supplies, predict floods, and for general climate research. History Installation of SNOTEL began in the mid-1960s. Its use in climate forecasting was not originally envisioned, but it has become the standard climate data for western U.S. locations which are elevated sufficiently to have at least a seasonal snowpack. Ongoing algorithm upgrades correct and backfill missing data, while improvements in communications improve the overall quality of data collection. Meteor burst technology meteor burst communications technology SNOTEL uses meteor burst communications technology to collect and communicate data in near-real-time. VHF radio signals are reflected at a steep angle off the ever- present band of ionized meteors existing from about 50 to 75 miles (80 to 120 km) above the earth. Satellites are not involved; the NRCS operates and controls the entire system. Sites are designed to operate unattended and without maintenance for a year. They are battery powered with solar cell recharge. The condition of each site is monitored daily when it reports on 8 operational functions. Serious problems or deteriorating performance trigger a response from the NRCS electronics technicians located in six data collection offices. The SNOTEL sites are polled by 2 master stations operated by NRCS in Boise, Idaho, and Ogden, Utah. A central computer at the NRCS's National Water and Climate Center (NWCC) in Portland, Oregon controls system operations and receives the data collected by the SNOTEL network. System capabilities The same SNOTEL site in Nevada. The large panel in the foreground is the snow pillow Basic SNOTEL sites have a pressure sensing snow pillow, storage precipitation gauge, and air temperature sensor. However, they can accommodate 64 channels of data and will accept analog and parallel or serial digital sensors. On-site microprocessors provide functions such as computing daily maximum, minimum, and average temperature information. Generally, sensor data are recorded every 15 minutes and reported out in a daily poll of all sites. Special polls are conducted more frequently in response to specific needs. The new generation of remote sites, master stations, and central computer facilities allows for hourly interrogation of remote sites. The system has the ability to vary the configuration of a remote site by transmitting the appropriate commands telling the remote site what sensors to turn on or what parameters to send. A variety of calculations can be made on any sensor channel. For example, the user can select maximum, minimum, average, standard deviation, or circular averaging. Each sensor can be accessed independently at a specific interval. For example, wind speed may be sensed every minute during the day to arrive at an average, while the snow pillow may be accessed every 15 minutes for the accumulated total. System performance has increased over the years, mainly due to a better understanding of meteor burst communication characteristics and improved equipment. While a 95 percent response to a system-wide poll is the standard, over 99 percent is common. Data storage, management and accessibility All data are received by the SNOTEL central computer, which in turn is linked to the Centralized Forecasting System (CFS) in the NWCC where data can be accessed. Once on the CFS the data is kept in a relational database, where various analysis and graphics programs are available. Current and historical data and analyses are available by dialing into the CFS, by disk or tape media, paper copy, and on the Internet.

The standard provides principles, a model and vocabulary as a basic framework for implementing effective corporate governance of information and communication technology (ICT) within any organization. The standard was the first \\"to describe governance of IT without resorting to descriptions of management systems and processes.\\" AS 8105 later became the catalyst and main infrastructure for the creation of the international ISO/IEC 38500:2008 Information technology — Governance of IT for the organization standard. History The collapse of the Dot-com bubble into the early 2000s brought about demands for greater corporate disclosure and accountability. The costly failure of many information technology (IT) initiatives caused many to point fingers at poor corporate and information governance. One location where the call for the development of new IT management and governance standards was answered was within non-government standards development body Standards Australia. An IT Management and Governance working group called IT-030 was announced in July 2002 and fully formed in August. The committee which drafted and recommended the publication included representatives from over 30 organizations, including the Australian Computer Society, Australian Bankers Association, Australian Institute of Company Directors, and Australia's Department of Defence. One of IT-030's first substantial meetings was held in Sydney September 24–26 with the goal of using a qualitative survey to gauge interest in developing a full standard. Those insights were discussed at a follow-up meeting in Canberra on September 30, agreeing that the \\"'Governance of Information and Communications Technologies' would be a more accurate reflection of the emerging scope of the standard.\\" By late January 2003, draft documents of the standard began to appear. By September 2004, the draft standard was being presented at the 2004 Australian Computer Society National Conference in Melbourne, and submitted comments were being resolved, with an eye on a late 2004 publication. The final version was published in January 2005. The standard The 12-page standard places responsibility for ICT firmly within the hands of the organization, and \\"[i]t involves evaluating and directing the plans for the use of ICT to support the organization and monitoring this use to achieve plans.\\" It features six main principles of quality governance of ICT: # Clearly delineate responsibilities for ICT. # Carefully plan ICT to best support the organization. # Ensure the acquisition of ICT is valid. # Ensure implemented ICT performs as expected, if not better, when needed. # Verify that ICT conforms to a set of formal rules. # Ensure ICT respects human factors. It also includes a model demonstrating how directors should monitor and evaluate how their organization is using ICT in response to the pressures and demands being placed on the company. The standard also lays out vocabulary that helps unify other previous standards with AS 8015. As one of the first standards to lay out IT governance so simply, AS 8015 strongly influenced the development of ISO/IEC 38500:2008 Information technology — Governance of IT for the organization, an international standard that went on to make \\"a clear distinction between governance and management.\\" See also * Corporate governance of information technology * Data governance * ISO/IEC 38500 References External links * Archive of early work by IT-030 * Background from Ramin Communications, a significant contributor to the project Category:Information technology governance Category:Corporate governance in Australia Category:Standards of Australia ","title":"AS 8015"},{"id":"3882531","text":"Nathanael Burwash (1839–1918) was a Canadian Methodist minister and university administrator.  Early life and education  Nathanael Burwash was born in St. Andrews East, Lower Canada, on 25 July 1839, the eldest son of the devout Methodists Adam Burwash and Anne Taylor. He was raised on a farm in Baltimore, Canada (a hamlet near Cobourg), to which his family moved in 1844. In 1959 he graduated with a Bachelor of Arts degree from Victoria College which was then located in Cobourg, Ontario, and was ordained by the Wesleyan Methodist Church in 1864. He later studied at Yale College and the Garrett Biblical Institute. He married Margaret Proctor on 25 December 1868 in Sylvan, Ontario. They had four daughters and eight sons together.  Career  Burwash was a managing editor of The Canadian Methodist Review In 1866, he was appointed professor of natural history and geology at Victoria College. In 1873 he became dean of theology there, and in 1887, he became chancellor and president of Victoria University, the new name of Victoria College, while retaining the deanship until 1900. He participated in the discussions which led to Victoria College's relocation from Cobourg to Toronto and its federation with the University of Toronto. He retired the university chancellorship and presidency in 1913, but continued to teach theology until his death. He was elected president of the Methodist Church's Bay of Quinte conference in 1989 and was a participant at each general conference of the Methodist Church from 1874 to 1894. He wrote several books, including a biography of Egerton Ryerson. Burwash Hall was named in his honour. Burwash died on 30 March 1918 in Toronto, Ontario, and was buried in Baltimore.

Pozderac was also the 3rd Member of the Presidency of Yugoslavia for SR Bosnia and Herzegovina from 15 May 1986 until 15 September 1987 and the 1st President of the Presidency of the Central Committee of the League of Communists of Bosnia and Herzegovina from 23 May 1982 to 28 May 1984. He was forced to resign from politics in September 1987. He was considered one of the most influential and powerful politicians in Bosnia and Herzegovina during the communist era. His removal from the political scene in the late 1980s is today considered one of the most controversial events that preceded the Bosnian War. Pozderac was removed due to the Agrokomerc Affair of 1987, which the Yugoslav press compared to the American Watergate scandal. Early life Pozderac was born in Cazin to an established Bosnian Muslim family which exerted strong influence in the westernmost part of the Bosnian region of Bosanska Krajina known for its strong resistance to the fascist Independent State of Croatia regime during World War II. During the war, he joined the illegal Alliance of Communist Youth of Yugoslavia (SKOJ) and the anti-fascist Partisan movement. He held various military and public posts in the Bosanska Krajina region during the war and was ordained with several military and public honors. Following the advent of communist rule, the Pozderac family affirmed its strong position in Yugoslav politics with Nurija Pozderac and Hamdija's brother, Hakija, both of whom held high positions in the Yugoslav government during and after World War II. Pozderac was a close ally of Josip Broz Tito, President of Yugoslavia for 27 years. Education Pozderac was highly educated, holding a philosophy degree from the University of Belgrade. He studied in Moscow, published several sociological studies, and was a professor of political science at the University of Sarajevo. Political activity Pozderac's politics centered on his involvement in the Communist Party of Yugoslavia that he ideologically followed. He held various high positions in the government of SR Bosnia and Herzegovina and SFR Yugoslavia in the 1970s and 1980s and exerted considerable influence on the politics of the communist party. He was president of the Federal Constitutional Commission of Yugoslavia which he held for nearly 20 years. His political ascendance began with economic revitalization of the Bosanska Krajina region, than impoverished region of SR Bosnia and Herzegovina. Pozderac provided the political backing to Agrokomerc, at the time small local food manufacturer which would later become one of the largest food manufacturing corporations in the former Yugoslavia. Agrokomerc proved to be the key to the economic prosperity of the region. While his primary goal was economic reform of then impoverished SR Bosnia and Herzegovina, which he relatively successfully implemented, Pozderac also played an important role in confronting nationalists from Serbia through a series of controversial and risky political moves. The reason he is today considered one of the most important Bosnian politicians is his significant role in constitutional amendments in the 1970s which recognized Bosnian Muslims as one of the constituent ethnic groups of SR Bosnia and Herzegovina and SFR Yugoslavia. Although his political orientation was left of center, and while he continually confronted nationalist politics of ethnic groups in former Yugoslavia, Pozderac inevitably contributed to the establishment of the process that led to the emergence of the modern Bosniak nation. A series of political attacks were reportedly staged against Pozderac by the Serbian lobby in Bosnia who tried to discredit and remove him from the political scene. One attempt was made by Vojislav Šešelj in the early 1980s, who learned that one of the students of Pozderac at the University of Sarajevo plagiarized portions of his dissertation, but was not punished for by Pozderac. Because the student Brano Miljuš was a high-ranking individual within the Communist party, controversy ensued but Šešelj's efforts were ultimately unsuccessful. =Sarajevo process= The most controversial process however was the so- called \\"Sarajevo process\\" in 1983. The Sarajevo process centered on convicting Alija Izetbegović for having written the Islamic Declaration. Pozderac reaffirmed his political opposition to Serbian nationalism and in particular to the politics of Slobodan Milošević, who was allegedly seeking to revert the constitutional amendments of the 1970s that awarded the Muslims the status of a constituent ethnicity. The \\"Sarajevo process\\" backfired as the Serbian lobby insisted that Bosnia was a \\"dark vilayet\\" where all those who oppose the government will be prosecuted and where Bosnian Muslim communists were prosecuting Muslim believers. Others interpreted the \\"Sarajevo process\\" as Pozderac's way of removing political amateurs who could end up disrupting the process of Bosnian independence. Izetbegović would later supersede Pozderac becoming the President of the Presidency of SR Bosnia and Herzegovina in 1990. =Agrokomerc Affair= Attacks on Pozderac culminated with the \\"Agrokomerc Affair\\" that began in 1987. In the 1980s Agrokomerc, one of the leading food manufacturers, was engulfed in questionable banking deals where the corporation issued numerous high interest promissory notes without the proper financial equity. Such practices were reportedly common within the Yugoslav system. The difference with Agrokomerc was that the director of the corporation, Fikret Abdić, lost the sense of scale as the corporation issued in excess of $500 million in \\"worthless\\" promissory notes. The problem became more acute as the press reported on it as the biggest economic affair in former Yugoslavia triggering the 250% inflation rate in Yugoslavia. Pozderac, who contributed to the initial growth of Agrokomerc, was indicted of being aware of the financial dealings of the company. However such accusations were never proven. The political blow to Pozderac came from Abdić's statement that he was in possession of audio tapes with conversations that would prove Pozderac's involvement in the scandal. While tapes were never actually presented, the political pressure on Pozderac culminated in September 1987, at which point he resigned from politics. Abdić would later join Alija Izetbegović in 1990 to form the Party of Democratic Action (SDA) and win the popular vote for the Presidency of Bosnia and Herzegovina in the 1990 Bosnian general election. Legacy Historical significance of Pozderac for the history of Bosnia and Herzegovina is today still debated among historians. He is criticized for his ideological following of the communist doctrines and for setting processes that did not honor certain liberties viewed in the western world as the core democratic principles, such as the freedom of speech. He was also criticized for being a cog of nepotism and although he did not subscribe to that tactic himself he certainly took advantage of it. As a result, Pozderac was criticized for contributing to the continued presence of Pozderac family on the political scene in Bosnia and Herzegovina. One however needs to view these issues from the context within which Pozderac operated. Being part of the communist system, Pozderac saw political ascendance possible only within the system. If one adds to this, the patriarchic nature of the Balkans, his strong leadership was proven to be the only potent power that could make the difference in SR Bosnia and Herzegovina of the communist era. He was the follower of the conviction that political, legal, philosophical, religious, literary, artistic and other progress is based on the economic progress. Pozderac is credited for implementing processes that led the economic revitalization of Bosnia and Herzegovina, which contributed to strengthening the cultural independence and identity Bosnia within Yugoslavia. Pozderac cannot be viewed as a movement leader but as a patient and principled politician who saw the opportunity for change by working within the system. His legacy certainly can be credited with contributions to the constitutional recognition of Muslims (historically revived as Bosniaks in 1993) as a constituent people within Bosnia and Herzegovina, along with the already recognised Croats and Serbs, and his persistent position in protecting those rights. He has also continually worked on protection of the sovereignty of Bosnia and Herzegovina within Yugoslavia and while he did begin some processes for which he would be criticized, many consider that without his involvement in the Yugoslav politics at the time, Bosnia may have not had the political nor other potency to pursue to independence in the 1990s.

It is a Roman Catholic day and boarding school, located in central Ballarat, Victoria. It provides education for boys from Year 7 to Year 12, with an emphasis on academic and sporting programs. The school continues the tradition of the Christian Brothers in providing education for boys in Victoria and continuing the tradition of Edmund Ignatius Rice, who founded the Congregation of Christian Brothers in 1802.  History  The college was originally called Holy Ghost College, which was started in 1888 and administered by the Holy Ghost Fathers. Also in 1888, St Alipius' Primary School was established by the Christian Brothers. However, after a promising start, the senior school closed due to the Holy Ghost Fathers' departure for France. The Bishop of Ballarat at the time, James Moore, contacted the Provincial of the Christian Brothers in Australia, Brother Patrick Ambrose Treacy, to take over the running of the school. The new college opened its doors on 24 January 1893, as St Patrick's College. Four Christian Brothers were on the initial staff, with the Brother J. L. Ryan as the founding headmaster. In 1924 St Patrick's Christian Brother's boys' primary school was built in Drummond Street South. This school and St Alipius were operated by the Christian Brothers at St Patrick's College but both became parish schools in the 1980s. St Patrick's College now no longer has a junior school attached to it and students commence at Year 7 having completed their primary education elsewhere. The school gradually grew in stature and size to become not only the largest Catholic school in Ballarat, but one of the leading Catholic schools in Victoria. The college, under the governance of the Christian Brothers, grew from its first enrolment of 36 students in 1893 to 168 in 1902. The school's academic record was first class even in its infancy, with the 1893 dux of the college, Sir Hugh Devine, becoming a world-famous surgeon. The school has grown immensely in the past 100 years, with over 1,000 boys enrolled. The college, in 1933, completed the construction of the Brother's residence, a large imposing red-brick building, still dominating the facade of the school. A memorial chapel was constructed in 1954 and dedicated to the memory of St Patrick's Old Collegians who died during the First and Second World Wars. This large Romanesque chapel still holds pride of place at the front of the school and is the centre of the school's spirituality. The college has over 300 graduates who have been ordained priests, a record in Australia. Over 60 graduates have entered into religious life. In 1966, the W.T. O'Malley Wing was completed in dedication to Brother William Theodore O'Malley, who was not only deputy headmaster of the college for 30 years, but taught there for over 40 years. He is remembered as one of the greatest brothers to grace St Patrick's College, with many Old Collegians dedicating their successes to his tuition. In 1976 the J.L. Kelty Resource Centre was opened. It is dedicated to Brother Justin Linus Kelty, a former headmaster, who led the college in the 1960s. In 1979, the college completed the W.T. O'Malley Sports Centre, which was officially opened by former students and Brownlow Medal winners John James and Brian Gleeson. In 2004, the college officially opened the W.J. Wilding Wing, which now houses the senior school. The building was named in honour of Brother William Wilding, a former headmaster of the college in the early 1980s who oversaw the completion of the Dr Spring Administration Wing. Peter Casey succeeded L. B. Collins in 2002 in 2002, becoming the school's first lay headmaster. John S. Crowley became St. Patrick's second lay headmaster in 2015. Student abuse scandals Between 1953 and 1983 a number of students who attended St Patrick's College made allegations that they were sexually assaulted. Some of these cases were litigated and the offenders found guilty. A Christian Brother who taught at St Patrick's College in the early 1970s was subsequently convicted of child sexual offences related to activities at the school. In May 2015 the Royal Commission into Institutional Responses to Child Sexual Abuse, a royal commission of inquiry initiated in 2013 by the Australian government and supported by all of its state governments, began an investigation into the response of Australian institutions, including the Catholic Church, to the impact of child sexual abuse on survivors, their families and their communities. The hearing heard from residents and former students of many Catholic institutions in Ballarat, including St Patrick's College, Ballarat; as well as members of the Ballarat community. Catholic clergy who were convicted of child sexual offences which took place within the geographical bounds of the Diocese of Ballarat were also invited to speak or make statements before the royal commission. The royal commission's final report about Catholic Church authorities in Ballarat was released on 6 December. The commission found that: \\"Many children, mainly boys, said they were sexually abused at St Alipius and/or St Patrick’s College.\\" That most allegation at St Patrick's College were related to Ted Dowlan who sought there from 1973 to 1975. \\"A number of the survivors who gave evidence said they believed a number of their classmates from St Alipius and St Patrick's College had died by suicide or died prematurely\\", because of the abuse and that there was systematic minimisation and cover up of the abuse. The Commission found that the response to the abuse from the Christian Brothers was \\"grossly inadequate\\", and said brothers were regularly shifted to a new location after an allegation had been made. Among those was the case of Brother Gerald Leo Fitzgerald, who died in 1987 before any charges were laid against him. One previous student told the inquiry of a culture of depraved sexual abuse and brutality which existed inside the school during the 1970s. St Patrick's College in Ballarat has stated it would remove Archbishop Little's (a former student) name from a building which had been named in his honour and revoke his status as an inducted legend of the college. This was because of the royal commission finding that Archbishop Little led a culture of secrecy in the Melbourne archdiocese designed to hide complaints against several priests and protect the church's reputation from scandal.  Influences  The college has four houses, Ryan, Keniry, Nunan and Galvin, which are named after former headmasters of the college. They are: * Ryan House Named in honour of J.L. Ryan – Headmaster from 1893–1894, who set the foundations of the college and led it during its formative years. * Keniry House Named in honour of E.F. Keniry – Headmaster from 1912–1915 and 1920–1924, who ran the college throughout the first part of the war and was a driving force behind establishing the Old Collegians Association. * Nunan House Named in honour of Paul Nunan – Headmaster from 1910–1912, Nunan put into effect the completion of the development plan and expanded the curriculum. * Galvin House Named in honour of T.B. Galvin – Headmaster from 1925–1926, Galvin was not only a man of great wit but is remembered as an academic and a brother who had a large influence over the boys at the time. The college promotes the teachings of Jesus Christ and the Catholic Church, basing itself on the four pillars of faith, excellence, tradition and joy. The patron of the college, Paul Bird, Bishop of Ballarat, presides over the major college Masses along with other priests (including former students of St Patrick's).  Headmasters  # J. L.

Lying about nine kilometres (5.5 miles) from Dublin city centre, the parkland comprises woodlands, ponds and walks. Recreational spaces include a nine-hole, par-three golf course (reopened in 2010 after redesign and rebuild), tennis courts, six soccer pitches, five GAA pitches, a cricket pitch, two children's playgrounds and a miniature railway run by the Dublin Society of Model and Experimental Engineers. There is also a craft courtyard with home craft shops and a coffee shop. Dublin County Council acquired the land in 1972 and developed it as a regional park. Opened in 1975, it is now administered by Dún Laoghaire–Rathdown County Council. Dublin Bus serves the park directly with the 16 bus, but the following bus is within walking distance: 14 directly to the city centre. The 75 bus goes to Dún Laoghaire. Since 2000 Marlay Park has become a popular music venue with a maximum capacity of 40,000 featuring both renowned national and international performers. The park's name is commonly misspelled as Marley, most notably in nearby housing developments (see below). Marlay House and Demense The park occupies part of the original Marlay demesne which has its origins in the early eighteenth century. Thomas Taylor acquired about 12 hectares of land and built a house called 'The Grange'. David La Touche, first governor of the newly established Bank of Ireland acquired the property in 1764 and extended the house. He renamed it for his wife Elizabeth Marlay, daughter of George Marlay, Bishop of Dromore. The La Touches developed the property, rebuilding the house and outbuildings and enlarging the extent of the demesne by acquiring adjoining land in 1776, 1777 and 1785. At its greatest extent the property amounted to 158 hectares. The house, a fine example of Georgian architecture, has many elaborate features including plasterwork by Michael Stapleton.

He named one of his ships 'Marlay', which sank off Howth in 1902 with the loss of 15 lives. His family lived there until 1925 when Robert Ketton Love bought the house for £8,325. He lived there until his death in 1939. His son, Philip Love, a market gardener who was once one of Ireland's largest tomato producers, was also a racehorse breeder whose famous horse Larkspur won the 1962 Epsom Derby. He died in August 1970 and in 1972 it was bought by Dublin County Council for £500,000. The park was officially opened by Taoiseach, Liam Cosgrave on 29 June 1975. A 1.82 hectare (4.5 acre) walled garden was built near the house around 1794, and consists of a restored regency ornamental and kitchen gardens. The ornamental garden boasts an extensive display of period plants, ranging from herbaceous borders to shrub beds. The Head Gardener's house, orangery, arbour and water features combine to create a distinctive atmosphere. Located just over the wall, the kitchen garden houses a fine collection of regency fruit trees, vegetables and associated bothies. Daily tours of the gardens take place during the summer months and by appointment at other times. The former gardener's house offers refreshments year round. Marlay Craft Centre Farmer's Market, held each Saturday and Sunday in the Craft Courtyard A number of small craft workshops are located in the 18th century stable yard adjacent to Marlay House including, weaving, glass cutting, bookbinding, furniture restoration, copper craft, pottery, jewellery and embroidery. One of these was originally the residence of Evie Hone whose stained-glass workshop was located in the library of Marlay House itself. Wicklow Way Wicklow Way trailhead Marlay Park is the official starting point of the 132 km Wicklow Way a long- distance walking trail, that begins at the car park adjacent to Marlay House. The trail wanders through the park before tunnelling under the M50 motorway to begin its first ascent southwards towards the Dublin hills and the Wicklow Mountains to Clonegal, County Carlow. Marley Grange Several housing developments adjacent to Marlay Park contain roads named \\"Marley\\": Avenue, Drive, Walk, Close, Grove and Wood. Early ordnance survey maps also use the same spelling, as does at least one local road sign. Longitude Festival Longitude Festival 2019 at Marlay Park Since 2013, Marlay Park has been home to Longitude Festival, which takes place during July each year. When the festival first started in its early years the line up was mostly bands and singer songwriters such as Phoenix, Kodaline, and Sam Smith.

She would deliver her lines with clarity and authority, exchanging lines with the lead actress. One of 9 siblings, she was the fourth child of Enrique Santos and Ursula Ortiz. She was discovered when she was accompanying her sister Aurora Aragon who was then in the movie industry away back in 1954. She started her career in Sampaguita picture on September 1954. In Sampaguita, her first movie was Binibining Kalog opposite Lolita Rodriguez and Ramon Revilla. In 1964, Zabala earned her first acting nomination as Best Supporting Actress for “Ang Bukas ay Akin!” topbilled by Charito Solis and Nestor de Villa.

Biržai is famous for its reconstructed Biržai Castle manor, and the whole region is renowned for its many traditional-recipe beer breweries. Names The name of the town is of Lithuanian origin and is spelled in different forms in other languages: Birsen (German), Birże (Polish), Birzhai (Биржай, Russian - pre-1917 Биржи), and בירז/Birz or Birzh (Yiddish) and simplified to Birzai in English. History Privilege granted to Biržai by Władysław IV Vasa The town's first written mention dates to 1455. The construction of Biržai Castle began in 1586, and the town was granted Magdeburg Rights in 1589. In 1575, as preparation for the castle's construction, a dam was built on the Agluona and Apaščia Rivers at their confluence, and the artificial Lake Širvėna, covering about , was created. It is the oldest surviving artificial lake in Lithuania. The town's history is closely associated with the Radziwiłł family (Lithuanian: Radvila). Jerzy Radziwiłł was the first noble to settle in the town. Later, after his daughter, Barbara Radziwiłł married the Grand Duke of Lithuania and King of Poland Sigismund II Augustus in 1547, the power and influence of the family grew immensely. The Radvila family established a Protestant church and school, and the town became a cultural center of the Protestant Reformation in Lithuania. The local community of Lithuanian Jews, which settled in the Duchy of Biržai at the end of the 16th century, was influential, establishing an interest-free loan society, two major flour mills, and an international linen export business. The Islamic Lipka Tatars performed military, police, and postal duties for the Radziwill family. Engraving of Biržai Castle in 17th century During the Wars with Sweden, Biržai Castle was an important point of defence. In 1625, Gustavus Adolphus, king of Sweden, attacked the castle with 8,000 soldiers and it was forced to surrender. The castle was left in ruins and was rebuilt, only to be burnt in 1655. In 1662–1669, it was rebuilt again in Renaissance style. On 9 March 1701, August II the Strong and Peter I of Russia (Peter the Great) signed a pact in the castle to unite their forces against Sweden. However, in 1704 the castle was completely destroyed and was left in ruins until its restoration in the 1990s. Tyszkiewicz Palace in Astravas suburb The town's population suffered greatly due to wars and religious conflicts between the Protestants and Catholics. In the late 18th century, Biržai lost its town rights. The Radziwiłłs lost their wealth and influence, and Biržai was sold to the Tyszkiewicz family to cover debts in 1811. In 1849–1862, the Tyszkiewicz family built a neoclassic Astravas Manor palace across the lake from the site of the original castle. In 1869 the town had about 2,600 residents. Thirty years later the population had grown to 4,400. During World War II, the entire Jewish population of Biržai was annihilated. 15 Jews were shot to death by German soldiers at the Biržai Jewish cemetery in July 1941. On 8 August 1941, Gestapo and Lithuanian collaborators murdered the entire Jewish population of the town, some 2,400 people, by shooting them to death at a mass grave in a forest grove outside the town. The town was almost completely burned down during the war. Oldtown was destroyed. In 1968 the population reached 10,000. Currently there are 15,000 people living in Biržai. Architecture Street of Vytautas, Birzai, 1930-40s Photographer Petras Loceris (1892-1973) After the unrest and conflicts have settled down, from the 19th-century wooden residential houses prevailed and with an ongoing industrial revolution at the time, asbestos or metal-sheet roofing was common. With the majority of buildings being wooden, masonry buildings eventually emerged to battle cold winters and hot summers. In the early 20th century, central roads were cobblestone. During the World Wars, the old town was destroyed and the majority of wooden buildings in the main street burned down. During the Soviet rule, the town's population grew twice its previous size. To accommodate the growth, around 60 new apartment buildings were constructed and main streets asphalted. There was also an increase in new houses being built from bricks instead of wood, and the majority of them were left not plastered. Work in progress and finished renovations in 2018 With the help of European Union's Development Assistance grants, the town was able to regain a unique style - since 2014 numerous apartment building renovations were carried out with more planned, the road infrastructure is being improved and some new constructions built to attract visitors and to restore the historic appearance. Biržai Castle Arsenal reconstructed in 2013 to restore a historic look of the Castle's yard 32 meters tall canoe-shaped Kirkilai Tower with a viewpoint to Kirkilai Lakes opened in 2015. The architects of the observation tower are Giedrius Akelis, Lina Šantaraitė Geography Sinkhole formed in December, 2004 The northern part of the town, along with Lake Širvėna, lies within Biržai Regional Park. About 9,000 sinkholes have been identified in the park, formed abruptly after gypsum in the soil has been dissolved by underground water. Some of these holes are dry, while others have become small ponds or lakes filled with water from the many underground rivers and streams. New holes appear annually. According to local legend, the 20-meter-deep sinkhole known as Karves ola (Cow's Cave) was discovered by a farmer after his cow disappeared. A tunnel at its bottom leads to a cave and underground lake. =Climate= Notable people  Saint John the Baptist church Biržai panorama * Jurgis Bielinis, publicist and one of the main organizers of illegal book-smuggling (knygnešiai) at the time of the Lithuanian press ban * Kazys Binkis, poet, playwright * Romualdas Brazauskas, basketball referee * Bernardas Brazdžionis, poet * Vladas Garastas, basketball coach * Petras Kalpokas, painter * Pinchas HaKohen Lintup (1851-1924), rabbi of Hasidic community * Jonas Mekas, film maker * Alfonsas Petrulis, signatory of the Act of Independence of Lithuania * Jerzy Radziwiłł, Great Hetman of Lithuania * Žydrūnas Savickas, strongman * Jokūbas Šernas, signatory of the Act of Independence of Lithuania * Austra Skujytė, olympic silver medal winner * Janusz Skumin Tyszkiewicz * Balys Sruoga, poet, playwright, critic, and literary theorist * Elchonon Wasserman, Lithuanian rabbi, disciple of Chofetz Chaim * Vytautas Laisonas, Lithuanian national painter Sport * FK Širvėna Biržai (football club); * Biržai Stadium (The current capacity of the stadium is 1,000 seats.); * KK Biržai (basketball club).

She was elected in 1999 as a Green Party member during a special election for Oakland's 16th Assembly District, but switched to the Democratic Party after losing the 2000 election. Early life and career Bock was born and raised in Berkeley, California.Green will bring new tone to Assembly , Patrick Hoge, Sacramento Bee, April 2, 1999 She attended Berkeley High School. She then attended Wellesley College, graduating in 1967. For the next five years, she lived in Japan, near Tokyo, where she taught English and helped to publish English-language travel books. After that, she returned to the United States to attend Harvard University, where she received a master's degree in East Asian studies. She stayed at Harvard to receive a PhD, where she wrote a dissertation on Japanese film directors. This involved returning to Japan and interviewing some directors, including Akira Kurosawa; the two struck up a friendship as a result. Bock's dissertation was published as the 1978 book Japanese film directors (). Bock served as an assistant producer on Kurosawa's 1980 film Kagemusha. Academic career Bock translated Akira Kurosawa's partial autobiography, Something Like An Autobiography (), which was published in 1983 by Vintage International. In 1985 she wrote the first book-length study in English of Mikio Naruse, Naruse: A Master of the Japanese Cinema. Bock has taught college classes, as well as teaching throughout Hayward as a K-12 and adult school substitute teacher. She holds a Certificate in Non- Profit Management from the University of San Francisco. In 1994, Bock joined the Green Party. She served as a volunteer on Ralph Nader's 1996 campaign for the presidency. California State Assembly Bock was elected to the Assembly in a 1999 special election after the mid-term resignation of U.S. Congressman Ron Dellums. Dellums' resignation caused a number of special elections that resulted in the ascension of State Senator Barbara Lee to Dellums' congressional seat (she had been Dellums' former chief of staff), and the rise of State Assemblyman Don Perata to Lee's Senate seat. The special election was the last in a series of five special elections in twelve months known as the special election musical chairs. Bock won the 1999 election by a combination of circumstances. Although she received less than 9 percent of the vote in the February 2 special election for Perata's assembly seat, no candidate received 50 percent of the vote; this caused a runoff among the top-vote getter from each political party. Bock was helped by a lackluster campaign and a scandal involving her Democratic opponent, former Assemblyman and former Oakland mayor Elihu Harris, who had received nearly 49% of the vote in the first election. Harris sent targeted mailers to households in selected precincts, mostly African American, urging voters to vote for him and receive a fried chicken meal if they presented a voting stub at selected supermarkets. There was voter backlash because of the perception of vote buying (Section 18521 of the California Elections Code prohibits offering money or \\"other valuable consideration\\" in return for voting; the Harris campaign argued the fried chicken coupons were not covered) and that the tactic had a subtext of racism. Working with Bock, in the capacity of Campaign Coordinator, John Maurice Cromwell helped build a coalition of Green Party members, disaffected Democrats and Republicans (who had no candidate in the race) to defeat Harris. Bock was outspent by Harris by a margin of better than 16 to 1 ($550,000 to $33,000).Victory by California Assembly Candidate Is First for Greens, Bill Staggs, April 4, 1999, The New York Times While an assemblywoman, she helped secure funding for numerous park projects, including restoration of the shores of Oakland’s Lake Merritt. On October 7,Ballot Access News Nov 1 1999 1999, Bock left the Green Party and re-registered as \\"Decline to State\\" so that she would not have to run in the March 2000 blanket primary and thus not have to compete directly against her Democratic opponent Alameda County Supervisor Wilma Chan until the November 2000 General Election, by when she presumably would have had more time to fundraise. During this same period, however, her acceptance of $500 campaign contributions from Chevron and Tosco drew criticism from within the Green Party. Running as an independent, Bock lost the November 2000 election and afterwards re-registered as a Democrat. Additional runs for office Bock announced her run against Barbara Lee in the 2002 primary as a Democrat, arguing that Lee's vote against the war in Afghanistan was unpatriotic. She later withdrew from the race before the filing deadline. In 2003, Bock ran for Governor of California in the 2003 California recall. She received 3,358 votes, placing 22nd in a field of 135 candidates.

While specialized graphics hardware existed at the time, such as blitters, the TMS34010 chip is a microprocessor which includes graphics-oriented instructions. This allows it to serve as a combined CPU and what would later be called a GPU. It was used as such in a number of high-profile arcade games, including Hard Drivin, Mortal Kombat, and NBA Jam, and in professional-level video accelerator cards for IBM PC compatibles in the early 1990s. The TMS34010 is a bit addressable, 32-bit processor, with two register files, each with fifteen registers and sharing a sixteenth stack pointer. The instruction set supports drawing into two-dimensional bitmaps, arbitrary variable-width data, and arithmetic operations on pixel data. The TMS34010 is capable of executing any general- purpose program and is supported by an ANSI compliant C compiler. The design of the TMS34010 was led by Karl Guttag, who previously worked on the Texas Instruments TMS9918 video chip. Development took place at TI facilities in Bedford (UK) and Houston (US). First silicon was working in Houston in December 1985, with shipment of development boards to IBM's workstation facility in Kingston, New York, in January 1986. TI's follow-up processor, the TMS34020, can be used with a floating point coprocessor to render three- dimensional graphics. Uses =Arcade games= The TMS34010 was used in many coin-operated arcade games from 1989 through 1995. Atari Games *Hard Drivin' (1989) *S.T.U.N.

In a 1991 article on graphics adapters, PC Magazine reported that the fastest boards for regenerating AutoCAD test images were based on the TMS34010. The Aura Scuzzygraph, Radius PowerView, and Radius SuperView external SCSI graphics cards for Apple Macintosh computers are based on the TMS34010. Sun386i uses TMS34010 in the CG5 (Roadracer) videocard. The Amiga A2410 graphics card uses the TMS34010 and was sold in Commodore Amiga UNIX workstations, the Amiga 2500UX and 3000UX. It was developed in conjunction with the University of Lowell. When running Amiga UNIX, the card supports the X Windows System and gives a high resolution 8-bit display. The card can also be used when running Amiga OS, with support libraries and some Retargetable Graphics implementations. =Game console= TI made an unsuccessful effort in 1987 and 1988 to convince games makers such as Nintendo and Sega to write 3D games and create a new console market. In 1987 TI provided the first demonstration of true real-time 3D games with stereo sound effects on a personal computer (PC), using a small TMS34010 adapter card (called \\"The Flippy\\"). The Flippy was designed as the basis of a game development system for consoles and as a PC gaming card in its own right. TMS34020 Texas Instruments TMS34020 Die of TMS34020 Die of TMS34082 The successor to the TMS34010, the TMS34020 (1988), provides several enhancements including an interface for a special graphics floating point coprocessor, the TMS34082 (1989). The primary function of the TMS34082 is to allow the TMS340 architecture to generate high quality three-dimensional (3D) graphics. The performance level of 60 million vertices per second was advanced at the time. The TMS34020 was used in some arcade games, such as Revolution X (1994). The Rambrandt Amiga extension card from Progressive Peripherals & Software supported up to four TMS34020, for use in virtual reality simulations.

It was first seen in the late 1980s in Australia. Jay Stacy (former record holder for most caps for the Kookaburras) is credited as first using the skill in the 1987 Australian Hockey Championships in Hobart. It is used as an attacking technique, mainly within penalty corner involving two main components known as the scoop and flick. However, as umpires become more and more strict within field hockey as new discoveries of techniques and training are subsequently making the sport more dangerous while also increasing the pace of the game. Therefore, it is evident that the drag flick is becoming more and more popular means of scoring even outside the penalty corner advantage. Although it is a somewhat dangerous piece of play for the opposition, it is within the rules and an effective technique for scoring. The drag flick involves a running up, and then forceful 'slinging' technique of the ball around your body, towards the goals. As drag flicking is not hitting the ball, the flicker is allowed to raise the ball at goals, hence making it a much more deadly alternative to hitting from the penalty corner as direct hitting shots on goal are not allowed to be above backboard height (460mm) during these set pieces.http://www.fih.ch/files/Sport/Rules/FIH- Rules%20of%20Hockey%202012-interactif.pdf The action involves a player crouching low down next to the ball and picking it up on the shaft of the hockey stick. The ball is then pushed along the ground whilst the stick is moving with a 'slinging' action. This serves to accelerate the ball, which is eventually released in a goalwards direction, often raised. Drag flicks are especially common during penalty corners, and are used as a variant to the 'straight shot' or hit. The main difference between the drag flick and the hit is that the drag flick is classified in the rules of field hockey, as a push, which are allowed to be raised higher from a penalty corner first shot. This has created a controversy, as drag flicks, although being allowed to be lifted at goals (and consequently the defenders within the goal), are often nearly as powerful as a hit. This leads to danger and a high risk of injuries. The differentiation to a simple flick is that for drag-flicking the player accelerates the ball from behind, leveraging the ball past his body and thus achieving a higher speed. Flicks are often used to quickly transfer the ball to an attacker when defence inhibits a flat pass. Besides, the technique of drag-flicking is not easy to perform when the ball is moving. As drag flicks have become more popular, specialist hockey sticks have been designed to complement the slinging action of the shot. These sticks are notable for their 'bow' or curve. An example of this would be hockey equipment manufacturer Grays International's Jumbow and Megabow range, which featured sticks from their GX series with greatly increased curvature. In 2005, the International Hockey Federation (FIH) limited the possible size of 'bows' allowed in international competitions which is now limited to 25 mm. The reason for this was that sticks with extravagant bows began to emerge. This led to dangerous levels of power being generated. (see Field Hockey#Equipment). However, there have been recent calls for further changes to the FIH rulings. The FIH official rules states that a bow's maximum curvature from a rest position can be no more than 25 mm. To traverse this, many top stick manufacturers began to build sticks with one significantly heavier edge than the other, thus, when the stick was put at rest, it tilted to one side, reducing the measure curvature. Using this loophole, many stick manufacturers have produced sticks that have bows much greater than 25 mm, sometimes even exceeding 35 mm. Along with changes in stick topography, as the drag flick became more prolific, it introduced the specialist drag flicker into a hockey team. In some cases, the drag flicker was not even part of the standard team but was substituted for a field player whenever a team was awarded a penalty corner. As soon as the penalty corner was over, the substitution was reversed. Because of this, it is now disallowed to substitute whenever a penalty corner situation is in effect, except for an injured goalkeeper, who may be substituted at any time. If a field player is injured during a penalty corner and has to leave the field for medical attention, a replacement player cannot enter the field until the penalty corner ends. Calum Giles (GB) was noted for being the best drag- flicker during this time, scoring 110 goals in 143 caps. Most national teams have a flicking expert within their sides, with some notable figures including Sohail Abbas of Pakistan, Sandeep Singh, VR Ragunath and Rupinder Pal Singh of India, Taeke Taekema of the Netherlands, Troy Elder of Australia and Hayden Shaw of New Zealand. Generally speed of drag flicks are in excess of 80 mph .

Naming  The term comes from the specification for Common Lisp, which explicitly refers to the language features for inter-language calls as such; the term is also used officially by the Haskell and Python programming languages. Other languages use other terminology: the Ada programming language talks about \\"language bindings\\", while Java refers to its FFI as the JNI (Java Native Interface) or JNA (Java Native Access). Foreign function interface has become generic terminology for mechanisms which provide such services.  Operation  The primary function of a foreign function interface is to mate the semantics and calling conventions of one programming language (the host language, or the language which defines the FFI), with the semantics and conventions of another (the guest language). This process must also take into consideration the runtime environments and/or application binary interfaces of both. This can be done in several ways: * Requiring that guest-language functions which are to be host-language callable be specified or implemented in a particular way; often using a compatibility library of some sort. * Use of a tool to automatically \\"wrap\\" guest-language functions with appropriate glue code, which performs any necessary translation. * Use of wrapper libraries * Restricting the set of host language capabilities which can be used cross-language. For example, C++ functions called from C may not (in general) include reference parameters or throw exceptions. FFIs may be complicated by the following considerations: * If one language supports garbage collection (GC) and the other does not; care must be taken that the non-GC language code does nothing to cause GC in the other to fail. In JNI, for example, C code which \\"holds on to\\" object references that it receives from Java must \\"register\\" this fact with the Java runtime environment (JRE); otherwise, Java may delete objects before C has finished with them. (The C code must also explicitly release its link to any such object once C has no further need of that object.) * Complicated or non-trivial objects or datatypes may be difficult to map from one environment to another. * It may not be possible for both languages to maintain references to the same instance of a mutable object, due to the mapping issue above. * One or both languages may be running on a virtual machine (VM); moreover, if both are, these will probably be different VMs. * Cross-language inheritance and other differences, such as between type systems or between object-composition models, may be especially difficult.  By language  Examples of FFIs include: * Ada language bindings, allowing not only to call foreign functions but also to export its functions and methods to be called from non-Ada code. * C++ has a trivial FFI with C, as the languages share a significant common subset. The primary effect of the declaration in C++ is to disable C++ name mangling. * Clean provides a bidirectional FFI with all languages following C or the stdcall calling convention. * CNI, alternative to JNI used in the GNU compiler environment. * D does it the same way as C++ does, with extern \\"C\\" through extern (C++) * Dart includes dart:ffi library to call native C code for mobile, command-line, and server applications * Dynamic languages, such as Python, Perl, Tcl, and Ruby, all provide easy access to native code written in C/C++ (or any other language obeying C/C++ calling conventions). * Factor has FFIs for C, Fortran, Objective-C, and Windows COM; all of these enable importing and calling arbitrary shared libraries dynamically. * The FFIs of Common Lisp and Haskell * Fortran 2003 has a module ISO_C_BINDING which provides interoperable data types (both intrinsic types and POD structs), interoperable pointers, interoperable global data stores, and mechanisms for calling C from Fortran and for calling Fortran from C. * Go can call C code directly via the \`\\"C\\"\` pseudo-package. * GWT, in which Java is compiled to JavaScript, has an FFI called JSNI which allows Java source to call arbitrary JavaScript functions, and for JavaScript to call back into Java. * JNI, which provides an interface between Java and C/C++, the preferred systems languages on most systems where Java is deployed. JNA provides an interface with native libraries without having to write glue code. Another example is JNR * Julia has \`ccall\` keyword to call C (and other languages, e.g. Fortran); while packages, providing similar no-boilerplate support, are available for some languages e.g. for Python (to e.g. provide OO support and GC support), Java (and supports other JDK-languages, such as Scala) and R. Interactive use with C++ is also possible with Cxx.jl package. * PHP provides FFI to C. * Python provides the ctypes and cffi modules. For example, the ctypes module can load C functions from shared libraries/DLLs on-the-fly and translate simple data types automatically between Python and C semantics as follows: import ctypes libc = ctypes.CDLL('/lib/libc.so.6') # Under Linux/Unix t = libc.time(None) # Equivalent C code: t = time(NULL) print(t) * P/Invoke, which provides an interface between the Microsoft Common Language Runtime and native code. * Racket has a native FFI based heavily on macros that enables importing arbitrary shared libraries dynamically. * Raku can call Ruby, Python, Perl, Brainfuck, Lua, C, C++, Go and Scheme Guile/Gambit * Rust also defines a foreign function interface. * Visual Basic has a declarative syntax that allows it to call non-Unicode C functions. * One of the bases of the Component Object Model is a common interface format, which natively uses the same types as Visual Basic for strings and arrays. * LuaJIT, a just-in-time implementation of Lua, has an FFI that allows \\"calling external C functions and using C data structures from pure Lua code\\". * PhoneGap (was called by the name Apache Callback, but now Apache Cordova) is a platform for building native mobile applications using HTML, CSS and JavaScript. Additionally has FFIs via JavaScript callback functions for access to methods and properties of mobile phone's native features including Accelerometer, Camera (also PhotoLibrary and SavedPhotoAlbum), Compass, Storage (SQL database and localStorage), Notification, Media and Capture (playing and recording or audio and video), File, Contacts (address book), Events, Device and Connection information.,. * Wolfram Language provides a technology called WSTP (Wolfram Symbolic Transfer Protocol) which enables bidirectional calling of code between other languages with bindings for C++, Java, .NET and other languages. In addition, many FFIs can be generated automatically: for example, SWIG. However, in the case of an extension language a semantic inversion of the relationship of guest and host can occur, when a smaller body of extension language is the guest invoking services in the larger body of host language, such as writing a small plugin for GIMP. Some FFIs are restricted to free standing functions, while others also allow calls of functions embedded in an object or class (often called method calls); some even permit migration of complex datatypes and/or objects across the language boundary. In most cases, an FFI is defined by a \\"higher-level\\" language, so that it may employ services defined and implemented in a lower level language, typically a systems language like C or C++. This is typically done to either access OS services in the language in which the OS' API is defined, or for performance considerations. Many FFIs also provide the means for the called language to invoke services in the host language as well. The term foreign function interface is generally not used to describe multi-lingual runtimes such as the Microsoft Common Language Runtime, where a common \\"substrate\\" is provided which enables any CLR-compliant language to use services defined in any other. (However, in this case the CLR does include an FFI, P/Invoke, to call outside the runtime.) In addition, many distributed computing architectures such as the Java remote method invocation (RMI), RPC, CORBA, SOAP and D-Bus permit different services to be written in different languages; such architectures are generally not considered FFIs.  Special cases  There are some special cases, in which the languages compile into the same bytecode VM, like Clojure and Java, as well as Elixir and Erlang. Since there is no interface, it is not an FFI, strictly speaking, while it offers the same functionality to the user.

Origins The village of Novaya Tsarevshchina became the cradle of the revolt, as it had been infiltrated by social revolutionaries since the 1880s. Many of these people were to become the leaders of the future \\"republic.\\" In 1902, the village teachers and doctor formed a peasant revolutionary club, which began to be especially active late in 1904. At about that time the revolutionary S.I. Akramovsky arrived in Samara, where he organized the \\"Peasants' Union.\\" Early in 1905 members of the Socialist-Revolutionary Party began arriving in the gubernia, and by the summer they had incited the peasantry to begin to rally and demonstrate. Towards autumn these manifestations had grown greatly in size, with the peasants even forming their own militia by the end of October. Soon similar demonstrations were taking place in the larger village of Stary Buyan, with slogans such as \\"Away with autocracy\\" (Russian: Долой самодержавие). The local police unit refused to restore order. Revolt and independence Early in November, the gubernia's authorities sent their representatives to Stary Buyan to select the new village elders. Instead of a routine ceremony, they were greeted by about 200 armed villagers from Novaya Tsarevshchina who called a village meeting. There the villagers voted to expel the Imperial representatives, form a \\"People's Militia\\" to guard the forests which were an important source of income, and set up a peasants' republic, effectively seceding from the Russian Empire. The new government set up a \\"Provisional Law\\" and began to confiscate land from landowners and distribute it evenly among the peasantry. Crushing of the revolt and aftermath The authorities in Samara finally decided to crush the fledgling republic. The early attempts of the police and guards to put down the revolt, however, were repulsed. The government then decided to dispatch a special punitive expedition of Cossacks and gendarmes led by the vice-governor of the gubernia to Stary Buyan. On 26 November 1905 the Stary Buyan Republic was crushed, and its leaders and active participants were arrested and sentenced. The effects of the rebellion were far-reaching, as the \\"Provisional Law\\" spread among the peasant communities of the Russian Empire and helped encourage further violence that we now know as the Russian Revolution of 1905.

All that is known of his personal life is gleaned from the Chahar Maqala itself.Edward Granville Browne, A Literary History of Persia, 4 vols. (New York: Charles, Scribner and Sons, 1902-1906), vol. 2, p. 337. Nizámí-i'Arúdí’s The Chahár Maqála, or Four Discourses, is a book consisting of four discourses on four different professionals that Nizami believed a king needs to have in his palace; in the preface of the book, Nizami discusses the philosophical or religious ideology of the creation of the world and the order of things. While he was primarily a courtier, he noted in his book that he was an astronomer and physician as well.Nizami Aruzi, A Revised Translation of the Chahár maqála (\\"Four discourses\\"), xi, 74, 96. He reports in the work that he spent time not only in his native Samarqand, but also in Herat, Tus (where he visited Ferdowsi's tomb and gathered material on the great poet), Balkh, and Nishapur, where he lived for perhaps five years. He also claimed to have studied under the astronomer-poet Omar Khayyám, a native of Nishapur.Browne, Literary History of Persia, Vol. 2, p. 337. In the introduction to the Chahar Maqala, Aruzi elaborates on issues of Natural Science, epistemology and politics. An identifying feature of Nizámí-i'Arúdí’s writing is the preface, \\"On Cosmography\\", is the extensive use of double balance sentences that gives the impression of belief in binary oppositions, or juxtaposition of two opposite things in everything. Also Nizámí-i'Arúdí’s scholastic Islamic ideology holds that a langue or a kind of metanarrative keeps things in order and is surrounded by smaller objects. This langue is God, who is ever-existent. He is a champion of the ancient Persian concept of kingship which, for the sake of legitimation, is expressed in Muslim vocabulary. His elaboration on the classes of society is influenced by Persian as well as Greek conceptions, especially those of Plato.Ashk Dahlén, Kingship and Religion in a Mediaeval Fürstenspiegel: The Case of the Chahār Maqāla of Nizāmi ʽAruzi, Orientalia Suecana, vol. 58, Uppsala, 2009.

Most, around 85%, are not clinically significant, but they can cause compression of the spinal cord by deforming the vertebral canal or causing instability. This condition occurs in the womb. Congenital vertebral anomalies include alterations of the shape and number of vertebrae. Lumbarization and sacralization sacral vertebra 1, seen as 6 vertebrae that do not connect to ribs. Lumbarization is an anomaly in the spine. It is defined by the nonfusion of the first and second segments of the sacrum. The lumbar spine subsequently appears to have six vertebrae or segments, not five. This sixth lumbar vertebra is known as a transitional vertebra. Conversely the sacrum appears to have only four segments instead of its designated five segments. Lumbosacral transitional vertebrae consist of the process of the last lumbar vertebra fusing with the first sacral segment. While only around 10 percent of adults have a spinal abnormality due to genetics, a sixth lumbar vertebra is one of the more common abnormalities. Dorland's Medical Dictionary Sacralization of the L5 vertebra is seen at the lower right of the image. Sacralization of the fifth lumbar vertebra (or sacralization) is a congenital anomaly, in which the transverse process of the last lumbar vertebra (L5) fuses to the sacrum on one side or both, or to ilium, or both. These anomalies are observed at about 3.5 percent of people, and it is usually bilateral but can be unilateral or incomplete (ipsilateral or contralateral rudimentary facets) as well. Although sacralization may be a cause of low back pain, it is asymptomatic in many cases (especially bilateral type). Low back pain in these cases most likely occurs due to biomechanics. In sacralization, the L5-S1 intervertebral disc may be thin and narrow. This abnormality is found by X-ray. Sacralization of L6 means L6 attaches to S1 via a rudimentary joint. This L6-S1 joint creates additional motion, increasing the potential for motion-related stress and lower back pain/conditions. This condition can usually be treated without surgery, injecting steroid medication at the pseudoarticulation instead. Additionally, if L6 fuses to another vertebra this is increasingly likely to cause lower back pain. The presence of a sixth vertebra in the space where five vertebrae normally reside also decreases the flexibility of the spine and increases the likelihood of injury. Hemivertebrae Hemivertebrae are wedge-shaped vertebrae and therefore can cause an angle in the spine (such as kyphosis, scoliosis, and lordosis). Among the congenital vertebral anomalies, hemivertebrae are the most likely to cause neurologic problems. The most common location is the midthoracic vertebrae, especially the eighth (T8). Neurologic signs result from severe angulation of the spine, narrowing of the spinal canal, instability of the spine, and luxation or fracture of the vertebrae. Signs include rear limb weakness or paralysis, urinary or fecal incontinence, and spinal pain. Most cases of hemivertebrae have no or mild symptoms, so treatment is usually conservative. Severe cases may respond to surgical spinal cord decompression and vertebral stabilization. Associations Recognised associations are many and include: Aicardi syndrome, cleidocranial dysostosis, gastroschisis 3, Gorlin syndrome, fetal pyelectasis 3, Jarcho-Levin syndrome, OEIS complex, VACTERL association.http://radiopaedia.org/articles/hemivertebra The probable cause of hemivertebrae is a lack of blood supply causing part of the vertebrae not to form. Hemivertebrae in dogs are most common in the tail, resulting in a screw shape. Block vertebrae Block vertebrae occur when there is improper segmentation of the vertebrae, leading to parts of or the entire vertebrae being fused. The adjacent vertebrae fuse through their intervertebral discs and also through other intervertebral joints so that it can lead to blocking or stretching of the exiting nerve roots from that segment. It may lead to certain neurological problems depending on the severity of the block. It can increase stress on the inferior and the superior intervertebral joints. It can lead to an abnormal angle in the spine, there are certain syndromes associated with block vertebrae; for example, Klippel–Feil syndrome. The sacrum is a normal block vertebra. =Fossil record= Evidence for block vertebrae found in the fossil record is studied by paleopathologists, specialists in ancient disease and injury. A block vertebra has been documented in T. rex. This suggests that the basic development pattern of vertebrae goes at least as far back as the most recent common ancestor of archosaurs and mammals. The tyrannosaur's block vertebra was probably caused by a \\"failure of the resegmentation of the sclerotomes\\".Molnar, R.

CT volume rendering. Butterfly vertebrae Butterfly vertebrae have a sagittal cleft through the body of the vertebrae and a funnel shape at the ends. This gives the appearance of a butterfly on an x-ray. It is caused by persistence of the notochord (which usually only remains as the center of the intervertebral disc) during vertebrae formation. There are usually no symptoms. There are also coronal clefts mainly in skeletal dysplasias such as chondrodysplasia punctata. In dogs, butterfly vertebrae occur most often in Bulldogs, Pugs, and Boston Terriers. File:Schmetterlingswirbel.jpgButterfly vertebra (red). Normal vertebra for comparison (blue). File:Volume rendering of CT of butterfly vertebrae.jpgVolume rendering of a CT scan of the lumbar vertebral column, showing butterfly vertebrae at several levels, most typically in L1. Transitional vertebrae Short ribs at the first lumbar vertebra, which is thus a transitional vertebra, since lumbar vertebrae normally do not have ribs attached to them. Transitional vertebrae have the characteristics of two types of vertebra. The condition usually involves the vertebral arch or transverse processes. It occurs at the cervicothoracic, thoracolumbar, or lumbosacral junction. For instance, the transverse process of the last cervical vertebra may resemble a rib. A transitional vertebra at the lumbosacral junction can cause arthritis, disk changes, or thecal sac compression. Back pain associated with lumbosacral transitional vertebrae (LSTV) is known as Bertolotti's syndrome. One study found that male German Shepherd Dogs with a lumbosacral transitional vertebra are at greater risk for cauda equina syndrome, which can cause rear limb weakness and incontinence. Spina bifida Spina bifida is characterized by a midline cleft in the vertebral arch. It usually causes no symptoms in dogs. It is seen most commonly in Bulldogs and Manx cats. In Manx it accompanies a condition known as sacrocaudal dysgenesis that gives these cats their characteristic tailless or stumpy tail appearance. It is inherited in Manx as an autosomal dominant trait.

It is located about 7 km from downtown Whitehorse, Yukon at the upstream end of Miles Canyon on the Yukon River. Summer tours are encouraged. Archaeological work shows evidence that First Nations people have used this area for many thousands of years. There were seasonal fish camps above and below Miles Canyon and the Whitehorse Rapids. Early explorers had little contact with the indigenous population, although Frederick Schwatka, in 1883, made note of a First Nations portage trail bypassing Miles Canyon, and, in 1887, George Mercer Dawson, noted the large number of salmon above the canyon — salmon were one of the fish that were important to the aboriginal population.  1898 The Gold Rush  During the Klondike Gold Rush, the thousands of stampeders travelling down the Yukon River to Dawson, Miles Canyon and the Whitehorse Rapids were the most treacherous obstacles on the entire route. Canyon City, at the upstream end of the canyon, was the place where people stopped to plan their next move. Many unloaded their boats and laboriously portaged their goods. By June 1898 a huge bottleneck had developed at Canyon City. Nearly 300 boats had been wrecked in the rapids, and five people had drowned; North-West Mounted Police Inspector Samuel Steele confessed: \\"why more casualties have not occurred is a mystery to me.\\" Steele issued an order that skilled pilots had to be hired to take the boats through. By then, a tramway had been built on the east bank of the river. It was eight km long and ran from Canyon City to the foot of the rapids, just across from the present site of downtown Whitehorse, hauling goods on horse-drawn cars for 3 cents per pound. A rival tram was also built on the west bank of the river. A small settlement developed at Canyon City, and a townsite was even surveyed there. Although it thrived for a short time, by 1900 the White Pass railway was completed to Whitehorse, and Canyon City had lost its reason for existence. Of the many modes of transportation developed during the gold rush, the most practical was the White Pass & Yukon Route, a narrow-gauge railway connecting Skagway, Alaska, at tidewater, with Whitehorse, at the head of navigation on the Yukon River. But the life of both before and after the gold rush are still being investigated at this interactive archaeological site.

Its formula is Ca9(MgFe)(PO4)6PO3OH. It is a relatively rare mineral but is found in granitic pegmatites, phosphate rock deposits, guano caves and in chondrite meteorites. It was first described in 1941 and named for Herbert Percy Whitlock (1868–1948), American mineralogist, Curator, American Museum of Natural History, New York City, NY, US. With regards to periodontal dentistry, magnesium whitlockite comprises one component of many of the inorganic content of calculus. It is found primarily in subgingival calculus (as opposed to supragingival calculus). It is also found more in posterior as opposed to anterior regions of the oral cavity.  Historical evolution of whitlockite as distinct minerals  Whitlockite is a member of the phosphate group of minerals with three distinct occurrences. For many years, these occurrences were thought to be identical. However, recent studies using x-ray and electron diffraction have been able to identify compositional differences that separate one type of whitlockite from another. There are two inorganic occurrences of whitlockite that differ chiefly by the presence or absence of hydrogen. This difference was not initially observed due to technical limitations, such as small crystal size. Although the identity of the “true” whitlockite is still debated, efforts are now being made to officially distinguish terrestrial whitlockite from its phase in meteorites as two distinct minerals. Whitlockite can also be found in different types of biological deposits. Organic instances of whitlockite are virtually identical in composition, but typically contain magnesium, which further distinguishes them from inorganic instances of this mineral. Magnesium whitlockite has been implicated in different disease states and is currently being studied for use in the fabrication of human prosthetics. The phosphate group is part of the largest class of minerals and consists of 763 known species. Of these, the most common phosphate mineral is apatite, which is frequently found as an accessory mineral in many types of rock, including igneous and metamorphic rocks. Apatite has also been found in hydrothermal veins and cavities or even Alpine-type veins associated with quartz. The most important varieties of apatite are represented by fluorapatite, hydroxyapatite, chlorapatite and carbonate-apatite Deer, W.A., R.A. Howie and J. Zussman. (1992) An Introduction to the Rock-Forming Minerals, 2nd Edition. Prentice Hall, HarlowKlein C. and B. Dutrow (2008) Mineral Science, 23rd Edition. Wiley, Inc., New York Because the composition of apatite varies, the term ‘apatite’ is often used to describe a variety of different phosphate minerals. Apatite are also commonly found in biologic systems, where they are a frequent component of structures such as bone. Whitlockite is a rare phosphate mineral often represented as a type of apatite. However, it differs considerably from most other phosphate minerals, including apatite, in its chemical composition and the molar proportions of these components. The first serious studies of the mineral whitlockite were launched in 1952 on terrestrial specimens from the Palermo pegmatite quarry near North Groton, New Hampshire. These specimens were initially used to describe the composition and structure of the mineral.Calvo, C., and R. Gopal. (1975) The Crystal Structure of Whitlockite from the Palermo Quarry. American Mineralogist, 60: 120-133. A decade later, the Apollo landing missions returned an impressive array of lunar rocks as well as other kinds of meteoric material. This unique resource led to an unprecedented barrage of geologic studies designed to characterize and define the composition and structure of minerals in these specimens. Throughout all studies on whitlockite, it has been found that the two most common phosphate minerals occurring in lunar rocks were apatite and whitlockite, and that they usually occur together.Joliff B.L., (2006) Crystal chemistry of lunar merrillite and comparison to other meteoretic and planetary suites of whitlockite and merrillite. American Mineralogist 91, 1583-1595. In the biologic literature, whitlockite and apatite are use interchangeably. Whitlockite is also associated so frequently with apatite in its biologic occurrences that it is frequently presumed to be apatite.Lagier R., and C.-A. Baud. (2003). Magnesium whitlockite, a calcium phosphate crystal of special interest in pathology. Pathol. Res. Pract. 199, 329-335. Geological occurrences Whitlockite has two inorganic occurrences with geologic significance. The first, known as terrestrial whitlockite, is found as a secondary mineral in granite pegmatites in such areas as Custer County, South Dakota, as dine crystals associated with quartz at the Tip Top mine, and at the Palermo mine in North Groton, New Hampshire.Roberts et al. 1974 The second occurrence is extraterrestrial whitlockite, which is now known as merrillite. Extraterrestrial whitlockite has been identified in lunar samples as well as martian and other types of meteorites, where it is one of the most common phosphate minerals. Studies of merrillite as an accessory mineral have provided valuable insights that have helped to unlock the petrogenesis of extraterrestrial rocks.Jolliff, et al., 2006 Biological occurrences Whitlockite can also be found in biological systems and has been implicated in several human diseases.Lee, R.S., M.V. Kayser . S.Y. Ali (2006) Calcium phosphate microcrystal deposition in the human intervertebral disc. J. Anat. 208, 13-9Lagier and Baud, 2003 Whitlockite can be found at many sites in the human body, but is particularly concentrated in calcified tissues, such as embryonic and adult bone. The highest concentrations of whitlockite appear in the weight bearing area of the femoral head. Traces of whitlockite have also been found in tuberculous lesions, urinary calculi and even prostatic deposits. Whitlockite can also be found in the oral cavity, where it is a primary component of dental calculi and salivary stones. Lastly, whitlockite can be found in aortic media, where it may be involved in arteriosclerosis. The presence of whitlockite at these places has not attracted much attention from biomedical scientists or clinicians, chiefly because whitlockite is not visible with the stains used to routinely examine microscopic sections of healthy or diseased tissue. However, the presence of whitlockite becomes obvious when X-ray diffraction is used to examine these sections.Lagier and Baud, 2003 In part, whitlockite occurs commonly in biologic systems because of the high concentrations of proteolipids and divalent cations in biologic fluids. Formation of this type of whitlockite is magnesium rich, and is preferred at temperatures typical of biologic systems because of the smaller diameter of the magnesium ion compared to calcium. Physical properties Each of the phases of whitlockite described above exhibit approximately the same physical properties. They display no cleavage, fracture subconchoidal to uneven, and tend to be brittle. They are classified with a hardness of 5 and a density of 3.12 g/cm3. Color varieties are colorless, white, gray, yellowish or pinkish, and can be transparent to translucent. Whitlockites exhibit a vitreous to resinous luster. The typical habit of whitlockite is rhombohedral crystals, but whitlockite can also rarely be tabular. The crystal habit of whitlockite also ranges from coarse granular to earthy.Hughes, J.M., Jolliff, B.L. and M.E. Gunter. (2006).

Education Bernard Levy grew up in the 1920s outside of New York City. At the age of ten, a young Berel decided to leave home and move in with his uncle. The move enabled him to attend the Yeshiva Torah Vodaas. He later traveled to study at the famed Lubavitcher Yeshiva in Otwock, Poland. He arrived in Otwock in 1937 and spent two years studying there. While there, Rabbi Velvel Solovetchik of Brisk befriended him. Most significant of all was his accessibility to the 6th Lubavitcher Rebbe, Rabbi Yosef Yitzchok Schneersohn and the fact that he was able to go into private audience with him. On the outbreak of World War II, he returned to America and in 1940 he was among the first students who sat down to learn in the Lubavitcher Yeshiva in 770 Eastern Parkway. Career =Jewish education= In 1944, Rabbi Yosef Yitzchok Schneersohn sent Rabbi Berel Levy to New Haven and worked tirelessly establishing the day yeshiva. From New Haven, he moved to Lakewood, NJ where he worked in the day school for three years. There he met Rabbi Aaron Kotler, with whom he would work closely in later years. After Lakewood, he moved to Elizabeth, NJ. Leaving Elizabeth for Brooklyn in 1960, he went to work for Torah U'Mesorah. At that time, he was closely associated with various Gedolim (great personalities) of various factions in Orthodox Jewry. His spiritual leader, Rabbi Menachem Mendel Schneerson would speak to him for hours concerning educational issues in America. He served as an unofficial conduit between the Rebbe and Rabbi Aaron Kotler and other Gedolim. He once spent an entire night discussing Torah U'Mesorah with the previous Satmar Rebbe. On this point, he also met and started a long relationship with Rabbi Moshe Feinstein. =Kosher supervision= In the mid-1960s, he started working in the field of kosher. At that time, certification was given with very little technical knowledge of the food industry. Often people just assumed things were kosher judging by the ingredients on the label. He took over some hechsherim in 1965. He started out with eleven or twelve hechsherim, and because of his personality and drive, companies kept coming to him applying for certification. He took over OK Kosher Certification in 1968. Until that time, no one had ever bothered traveling to check ingredients and products coming from overseas. Being a real pioneer in the kosher industry, Rabbi Berel Levy always wanted to see how everything was produced. He would check as far back as he could, finding that each ingredient was made up of many ingredients until eventually he saw the need to certify the plants. And so, one thing led to another and international travel for kosher certification became a necessity. OK Labs was the first to begin certifying companies in the Far East, starting with palm oils and chemicals. Today in Malaysia, Singapore, Indonesia, Korea, Japan and China the OK is the primary kosher organization in that part of the world. He pioneered giving certifications, only after totally familiarizing himself with all the mechanical and chemical components of the food industry. He was the first one to make extensive trips to the Far East to inspect the products coming from there. Even countries not particularly friendly to Jewish people, didn't faze him. He was the first to visit Malaysia. The Lubavitcher Rebbe would ask him to perform a particular task in a foreign country he would be in. He always made certain to carry out every detail of the Rebbe's advice. A mikveh was built in the Philippines, a mechitzah was raised in the shul of Kobe, Japan.

Led by a planning committee, its multilingual membership is drawn from the predominantly low-income, African-American, Latino and Asian mass transit ridership of Los Angeles County. The BRU's central focus has been policies of the Los Angeles County Metropolitan Transportation Authority (LACMTA) that it identifies as racial discrimination. The BRU attracted international attention when it successfully sued LACMTA under Title VI of the Civil Rights Act in 1994 and its example has inspired similar efforts to organize mass transit passengers. Formation The Bus Rider's Union is a project of the Labor/Community Strategy Center (LCSC) that began as an outgrowth of the LCSC's Labor/Community Watchdog environmental justice campaign against air pollution in the L.A. Port area. The BRU was founded by the LSCS's director, Eric Mann who is also co-chair of the union along with Barbara Lott-Holland. The LCSC began organizing bus riders in 1992 and, as it expanded its tactics from grassroots organizing to include legal action, it built \\"across geographic and ethnic lines\\" to bring together \\"a multiethnic, progressive coalition.\\" In 1996, it filed a civil rights lawsuit in association with the Southern Christian Leadership Conference and Korean Immigrant Workers Advocates against the Los Angeles County Metropolitan Transportation Authority, alleging that the LACMTA was using federal funds for public transit in a discriminatory manner. A feature-length documentary titled Bus Riders Union (2000) directed by Academy Award-winning cinematographer Haskell Wexler, captures the early years of organizing through to the signing of the consent decree. Civil Rights Consent Decree, 1996-2006 Represented by Constance Rice and others from the NAACP Legal Defense and Educational Fund, LCSC, BRU, Southern Christian Leadership Conference and Korean Immigrant Workers Advocates were able first to obtain an injunction preventing LACMTA from eliminating the monthly pass in 1994. In 1996 after a high-profile media and grassroots campaign against LACMTA's policies of \\"transit racism,\\" LCSC, BRU et al. agreed to sign with LACMTA a Title VI consent decree. The plaintiffs argued that LACMTA was using disproportionately more of its federal funds on the suburban-oriented rail service and its wealthier, whiter ridership, at the same time as it was spending disproportionately less on the bus system and its much larger, lower-income ridership, predominantly made up of people of color. As of July 2007, 17% of LACMTA's rail riders were white classified as white non-Hispanics. In contrast, only 10% of bus riders were classified as white non-Hispanics. Martin Wachs and Richard Berk of UCLA, and James Moore II of USC were among the professors of transportation, planning and statistics who provided expert reports and other assistance to the plaintiffs. The former chief financial officer of LACMTA's predecessor agency, Thomas Rubin, also provided key assistance to the plaintiffs. LACMTA agreed to settle the case on the eve of the trial, \\"when it faced extensive public disclosure and media coverage of its discriminatory, inefficient, and environmentally destructive transportation policies.\\" The consent decree required LACMTA to: * retain the unlimited monthly-use pass and reduce it from $49 to $42; reduce the biweekly pass from $26.50 to $21; and to create a new weekly pass for $11 * purchase 102 buses to ease existing overcrowding on the buses * commit to reducing overcrowding levels by specified goals and specified times, working under a court-appointed Special Master with BRU in a Joint Working Group over the life of the decree * create new bus services designed to connect people of color and the poor to job and medical sites. The LACMTA and BRU disagreed many times whether the LACTMA was in compliance with the new rules. Over the course of the decree, it appealed rulings based on the consent decree numerous times, including a final appeal that it took to the Supreme Court, which was rejected in March 2002. In 2006, as the decree was set to expire, BRU et al. filed an appeal to extend it, but it was rejected by the Ninth Circuit Court of Appeals in 2009. =Controversy= The consent decree has been a controversial subject in local news media. Over the course of the decree, local columnists and news outlet OpEds have taken positions for and against the decree and various rulings associated with it. Current activism Recently, the BRU has branched out into other civil rights issues. The BRU was one of the sponsors of the Great American Boycott demonstration in Los Angeles on May 1, 2006. The current campaign is \\"1,000 More Buses, 1,000 Less Police\\", as the BRU is advocating that policing be reduced throughout the city because of past abuses by the Los Angeles Police Department of minority civil rights. The Bus Riders Union strongly opposed the fare increases that were proposed in 2007. While the turnout of members at the hearing was impressive, the strategy of having a fare decrease as their chief demand was ineffectual. The BRU has since taken credit for highlighting equity issues in the debate over bus fares, but has offered no substantive solutions to increase transit funding. The LCSC has launched a Center for Transportation Strategies intended to expand its involvement with regional and national transportation issues as an outgrowth of a 2005 conference attended by activists from around the U.S. Since 2004, the BRU has engaged in an ongoing advocacy campaign for the placing of bus only lanes along Wilshire Boulevard. Criticism Criticism of the BRU points to the high use of some LACMTA rail lines among minorities to argue that the BRU legal case and its assertion of racism has no basis. Critics also take issue with the BRU’s rhetorical or political style, contending that BRU organizers are overly combative and ideological. An additional line of criticism draws from modal debates in the field of urban transit planning, asserting that rail should hold a higher priority than the bus, or that the BRU’s overemphasis on one mode is counterproductive. In addition, criticism has centered on the BRU's non-bus related civil rights activities. A columnist in the Jewish Journal criticized the BRU for publishing flyers comparing the situation of Palestinians to those of Jews in Nazi Germany, and questioned the BRU taking funds from the Nathan Cummings Foundation, a foundation \\"formed in the Jewish tradition\\".

Hydroseeding in the United Kingdom Erosion control is the practice of preventing or controlling wind or water erosion in agriculture, land development, coastal areas, river banks and construction. Effective erosion controls handle surface runoff and are important techniques in preventing water pollution, soil loss, wildlife habitat loss and human property loss. Usage Erosion controls are used in natural areas, agricultural settings or urban environments. In urban areas erosion controls are often part of stormwater runoff management programs required by local governments. The controls often involve the creation of a physical barrier, such as vegetation or rock, to absorb some of the energy of the wind or water that is causing the erosion. They also involve building and maintaining storm drains. On construction sites they are often implemented in conjunction with sediment controls such as sediment basins and silt fences. Bank erosion is a natural process: without it, rivers would not meander and change course. However, land management patterns that change the hydrograph and/or vegetation cover can act to increase or decrease channel migration rates. In many places, whether or not the banks are unstable due to human activities, people try to keep a river in a single place. This can be done for environmental reclamation or to prevent a river from changing course into land that is being used by people. One way that this is done is by placing riprap or gabions along the bank.

WPC has contributed land to 12 state parks and conserved more than a quarter million acres of natural lands. The Conservancy plants and maintains more than 132 gardens in 20 Western Pennsylvania counties, as well as planting thousands of trees through its community forestry program. WPC has protected or restored more than of rivers and streams. In 1963, Edgar Kaufmann Jr. entrusted Frank Lloyd Wright's masterwork Fallingwater to the Conservancy. The house was called the most important building of the 20th century by the American Institute of Architects. Charity Navigator awarded the Conservancy its highest rating for the seventh year. Of the thousands of charities the independent evaluator has reviewed, only 2 percent have received as many consecutive four- star ratings. Fallingwater, maintained and preserved by the Western Pennsylvania Conservancy, is open to visitors. History Three years into the Great Depression, ten citizens came together to found a nonprofit conservation organization.http://waterlandlife.org/4/history/ The organization’s goal was to alleviate widespread unemployment through public works programs that would also create a positive impact on the region’s natural resources. Formerly known as the Greater Pittsburgh Parks Association, WPC began its work landscaping a park along Pittsburgh's Bigelow Boulevard.http://waterlandlife.org/5/ By 1945, the Conservancy was acquiring large tracts of land in Lawrence County that eventually became part of McConnells Mill State Park. In 1961, a 300-acre wildflower reserve was acquired in Beaver County and is still considered to be one of the finest stands of native wildflowers in southwestern Pennsylvania. The wildflower reserve is now part of Raccoon Creek State Park.  Offices  While the Western Pennsylvania Conservancy's main headquarters is in Pittsburgh, PA, the organization has several regional offices in the state. Offices are also held in Indiana, Mill Run, Ridgway, Franklin, Ligonier, Hollidaysburg and Harrisburg. Land and Water Conservation The Conservancy has protected more than a quarter million acres of land since 1932. The Conservancy’s work enables protection of important natural resources and creates economic benefits through an area’s tourism, recreation and forestry. Most of the land preserved by WPC is now publicly owned, becoming some of Pennsylvania's premier parks, forests, game lands and natural areas, or subject to conservation easements that allow public access.http://waterlandlife.org/292/wpc-properties WPC acquired land for the creation of 12 state parks, including: *Ohiopyle State Park, including Ferncliff Peninsula National Natural Landmark *Laurel Ridge State Park *Oil Creek State Park *McConnell's Mill State Park *Moraine State Park *Erie Bluffs State Park *Canoe Creek State Park *Cook Forest State Park *Shawnee State Park *Raccoon Creek State Park *Clear Creek State Park *Blue Knob State Park The Conservancy also owns and manages more than 12,000 acres of land throughout Western Pennsylvania. Many of these natural areas offer hiking trails for the public to enjoy. Its largest natural area is Bear Run Nature Reserve in Fayette County, located down the road from Fallingwater. Totaling more than 5,000 acres, this nature reserve features 20 miles of hiking trails and several campsites. The Conservancy has also protected or restored more than 3,000 miles of waterways. Its watershed conservation work began as a technical assistance program for watershed groups in Western Pennsylvania. In 2011, the program was formalized to include a full suite of watershed restoration services for local communities.http://waterlandlife.org/112/conserving-water Currently, the Western Pennsylvania Conservancy's watershed conservation program offers in-stream monitoring and assessment, stream restoration and habitat improvement, abandoned mine drainage remediation, riparian buffer plantings, agricultural best management practices and other projects and surveys. The watershed conservation program also provides schools and students of all ages with hands-on educational presentations that help people understand the importance of clean water and healthy ecosystems in Pennsylvania. Community Gardens, Forestry and Green Spaces WPC's community gardens and greenspace program plants and maintains 132 community gardens every spring in 20 Western Pennsylvania counties, with the help of 12,000 volunteers.http://waterlandlife.org/36/gardens-and-greenspace For many decades, the Conservancy has worked with PennDOT, municipalities and other local entities to transform vacant land into community flower gardens. WPC is also the managing partner of TreeVitalize Pittsburgh, a joint project of Allegheny County, City of Pittsburgh, Tree Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania Department of Conservation and Natural Resources, and the Western Pennsylvania Conservancy. TreeVitalize Pittsburgh has planted more than 29,000 trees since 2008 in an effort to improve the quality of life and the environment in the Pittsburgh region.http://www.apps.dcnr.state.pa.us/news/resource/res2013/13-1113-treevitalize.aspx Through this program, any Allegheny County resident may apply for trees on behalf of their community and all trees are planted on public property. Other community forestry projects led by the Conservancy include the Pittsburgh Redbud Project, Trees for Ligonier, and the Pittsburgh Street Tree Inventory. A partnership of WPC, the Grable Foundation and Pittsburgh Public Schools, brought sustainable landscape to 57 Pittsburgh public schools.http://www.paconserve.org/237/school-greening The project provided outdoor classrooms, natural play spaces and low-care plantings to provide shade, landscape accents and natural points of interest for children. Biodiversity Conservation and Conservation Science The Western Pennsylvania Conservancy uses science as an essential tool to prioritize the places that it seeks to protect and set long-term conservation goals. Through its conservation science program and the Pennsylvania Natural Heritage Program, WPC scientists provide scientific information, expertise and assistance to support the conservation of Pennsylvania's biological diversity. The Pennsylvania Natural Heritage Program is a partnership of the Pennsylvania Department of Conservation and Natural Resources, the Western Pennsylvania Conservancy, the Pennsylvania Game Commission and the Pennsylvania Fish and Boat Commission.http://www.naturalheritage.state.pa.us/About_PNHP.aspx First established in 1981, PNHP is responsible for the inventory and monitoring of threatened and endangered species of (both state and federal) and natural communities. The program also maintains the Pennsylvania Natural Diversity Inventory (PNDI) database,http://www.gis.dcnr.state.pa.us/hgis- er/PNDI_Introduction.aspx/ which contains records for threatened, endangered and other listed species and communities.

In this disease, a cyclical resorption of normal bone and replacement by immature bone occurs along the inner and outer surfaces of the affected bones. It usually occurs between the ages of 3 and 8 months. Breeds most commonly affected include the West Highland White Terrier, Scottish Terrier, Cairn Terrier, and Boston Terrier. It is rare in large-breed dogs, but it has been reported. Symptoms include firm swelling of the jaw, drooling, pain, and difficulty eating. It is an inherited disease, especially in Westies, in which it has been recognized as an autosomal recessive trait. Canine distemper has also been indicated as a possible cause, as has E. coli infection, which could be why it is seen occasionally in large-breed dogs. Growth of lesions will usually stop around the age of one year, and possibly regress. This timing coincides with the normal completion of endochondral bone growth and ossification. If the disease is extensive, especially around the tympanic bulla (middle ear), then the prognosis is guarded. A similar disease seen in young Bullmastiffs is known as calvarial hyperostotic syndrome. It is also similar to human infantile cortical hyperostosis. It is characterized by irregular, progressive bony proliferation and thickening of the cortical bone of the calvaria, which is part of the skull. Asymmetry of the lesions may occur, which makes it different from craniomandibular osteopathy. Symptoms include painful swelling of the skull, fever, and lymph node swelling. In most cases it is self-limiting.

Typically, a student's athletic eligibility in a given sport is four seasons, aligning with the four years of academic classes typically required to earn a bachelor's degree at an American college or university. However, in a redshirt year, student athletes may attend classes at the college or university, practice with an athletic team, and \\"suit up\\" (wear a team uniform) for play – but they may compete in only a limited number of games, (see \\"Use of status\\" section). Using this mechanism, a student athlete has at most five academic years to use the four years of eligibility, thus becoming what is termed a fifth-year senior. Etymology and origin According to Merriam-Webster and Webster's Third New International Dictionary, Unabridged, the term redshirt comes from the red jersey commonly worn by such a player in practice scrimmages against the regulars. The origin of the term redshirt was likely from Warren Alfson of the University of Nebraska who, in 1937, asked to practice but not play and wore a Nebraska red shirt without a number. The term is used as a verb, noun, and adjective. For example, a coach may choose to redshirt a player who is then referred to as a redshirt, and a redshirt freshman refers to an athlete in the first year of participation, after a redshirt non-participatory year. Reasons Student athletes become redshirts for many reasons. One example is that the student athlete may not be ready to balance the demands of both academic and athletic requirements. Redshirting provides the opportunity, with tutoring, to take some classes and become accustomed to the academic rigors demanded of them. They may also redshirt to undergo a year of practice with a team prior to participating in competition. In American college football, a student athlete may redshirt to work towards increasing size, strength, and stamina; all desirable assets for many positions, as the current and post- redshirt years coincide with the final phases of physical maturity. Players may also redshirt to learn the team playbook, as many college teams run more complex formations and executions in comparison to high school teams. Athletes may be asked to redshirt if they would have little or no opportunity to play as an academic freshman. This is a common occurrence in many sports where there is already an established upperclassman player in a position, or too much depth at the position the freshman in question plans to play. The coaching staff may also want to use the player as a starter later in their career so that they may play for the full four years instead of three. A special case involves the eligibility of a player who loses the majority of a season to injury, known as a medical redshirt. A hardship waiver may be granted to those athletes who sustain a major injury while appearing in less than 30% of team competitions and have not participated after the midpoint of a season. For the purposes of eligibility, players granted such a waiver are treated as though they did not compete in that season. On rare occasions, players may be allowed to play in a sixth year of college if they suffered a serious injury that kept them from competing for more than one season. Former Oklahoma quarterback Jason White is perhaps the best known example of this; White had redshirted his first year, then subsequently tore the ACL in both knees, forcing him to miss nearly two years of eligible play time. Another recent example is former Houston Cougars quarterback Case Keenum. He redshirted his freshman year of 2006, and subsequently tore an ACL three games into the 2010 season, which would have otherwise been his final year of eligibility. Terminology The term redshirt freshman indicates an academic sophomore who is in their first season of athletic participation. A redshirt freshman is distinguished from a true freshman: a student who is in their first year both academically and athletically. A redshirt freshman may have practiced with the team during the prior season. The term redshirt sophomore is also commonly used to indicate an academic junior who is in the second season of athletic participation. After the second athletic year, the term redshirt is rarely used; the terms fourth-year junior and fifth-year senior are used instead. In 2016, a new status could be applied to prospective student athletes, dubbed an academic redshirt. That year, the NCAA started enforcing new, stricter admissions requirements for incoming athletic freshmen. Under these new requirements, a student athlete who meets a school's own academic admission requirements but does not meet the NCAA requirement of a 2.3 GPA across four years, may enter school as an academic redshirt. This student can receive an athletic scholarship and practice with the team, but may not participate in competition. An academic redshirt does not lose a year of eligibility, and may later take an injury redshirt if needed. Finally, as long as an academic redshirt completes nine academic credit hours in their first semester they may then compete in their second year free of restrictions. Other colors Athletes may also use a \\"grayshirt\\" year, in which they attend school as neither a full-time student nor the recipient of a scholarship. They are an unofficial member of the team and do not participate in practices, games, or receive financial assistance from the athletic department. Typically, grayshirts are players who are injured right before college and require an entire year to recuperate. Rather than waste the redshirt, the player can attend school as a part-time student and join the team later. This is also used by players with religious or military obligations that keep them out of school for a full academic year. \\"Blueshirt\\" athletes are those that the NCAA does not classify as a \\"recruited student- athlete\\". They have never made an official visit to the school, met with the school's athletic employees, had more than one phone call with them, or received a scholarship offer. Such athletes are walk-ons, but can receive scholarships after enrolling; although they are immediately eligible to play, their scholarships count for the school's quota in the following year. The New Mexico State Aggies football program was the first to blueshirt in the early 2000s; other football programs include Oklahoma State. There also exists a \\"blackshirt\\" which is unique to Nebraska football, where the term redshirt likely originated. This is a tradition, generally denoting a starter or otherwise key contributor on Nebraska's defense, and is not related to eligibility. Use of status While the redshirt status may be conferred by a coach at the beginning of the year, it is not confirmed until the end of the season, and more specifically, it does not rule a player ineligible in advance to participate in the season. If a player shows great talent, or there are injuries on the team, the coach may remove the redshirt status and allow the player to participate in competition for the remainder of the year. The first athlete known to extend his eligibility in the modern era of redshirting was Warren Alfson of the University of Nebraska in 1937. Alfson requested that he be allowed to sit out his sophomore season due to the number of experienced players ahead of him. In addition, he had not started college until several years after graduating from high school, and thus felt he needed more preparation. The year off greatly benefited him; Alfson was All-Big Six Conference in 1939 and an All-American guard in 1940. In January 2017, the trade association for college football coaches, the American Football Coaches Association, proposed a change to that sport's eligibility rules that maintains the current model of four years of play in five years, but significantly changes the redshirt rule. Under the proposal, medical redshirts would be eliminated, but redshirt status would not be lost unless a player participated in more than four games in a season. The proposal, which was unanimously passed by the AFCA subcommittees for all three NCAA divisions, was approved by the NCAA Division I Council in June 2018, taking effect with the 2018 college football season.

With its almost 8,000 inhabitants Bad Berka is the second biggest city in Weimarer Land district (after Apolda, 23,000). The river flowing through the city, which is embedded in new red sandstone, is called Ilm. Since 1 December 2008, the city has incorporated the former municipality of Gutendorf. Bad Berka is a spa town with an iron-rich spring and Kneipp facilities. In 2002 the award of \\"State Recognised Spa with Mineral Spring Health Facility\\" was given to the city. In order to treat tuberculosis, a clinic was erected in 1952. This was the beginning of the main economic sector of the city. Bad Berka's Zentralklinik has since gained a reputation as a center of medicinal expertise far beyond the boundaries of Germany. Its foundation can be traced back to 1898. In addition, there was a rehabilitation clinic built after the fall of the Berlin Wall. The \\"Median-Klinik\\" consists of two buildings, which were opened in 1994 and 1997. Because of its vicinity to the cultural capital Weimar and association with numerous historical figures, Bad Berka is also popular among tourists. Between 1812 and 1828 Goethe visited his friend Heinrich Friedrich Schütz several times. He was also involved in the plans of the spa. Therefore, Bad Barka is called \\"Das Goethebad im Grünen\\" (Goethe spa in greenery), as well. Bad Berka is surrounded by spruce and beech forest. Other bigger cities in the vicinity are Jena ( north-east), Erfurt ( north-west) and Weimar ( north). History In 1251, a Cistercian nunnery was founded at Bad Berka, and the sulphur bath spa was established in 1813. Within the German Empire (1871-1918), Bad Berka was part of the Grand Duchy of Saxe-Weimar-Eisenach. In 1945, bombing targets of the Oil Campaign of World War II were the Bad Berka oil plant, oil storage, and underground forced labor plant. The annual Party.San Open Air music festival was first held in 1996.

Her husband was Emperor Fei of Jin. Yu Daolian was the daughter of Yu Bing (庾冰), one of the co-prime ministers during the reigns of Emperor Cheng and Emperor Kang -- both his nephews and sons of his sister Empress Yu Wenjun, making her an aunt to her husband, who was Empress Yu Wenjun's grandson. Little is known about her. She was already Emperor Fei's wife when he was Prince of Donghai during the reign of his cousin Emperor Mu, and she then carried the title of Princess of Donghai. Presumably, after he was given the greater title of Prince of Langye after his brother Emperor Ai became emperor in 361, she carried the title of Princess of Langye, but there was no record of her using that title. After her husband became emperor in 365 after his brother's death, he created her empress. She died a year later in 366, without having had any children, and was given the posthumous name Empress Xiao and buried with honors due an empress. (The reason why her posthumous name was one character rather than two, as was customary for empresses of the period, was that typically one character came from her husband's posthumous name, but her husband, who was later deposed, did not have a posthumoust name and therefore had no character to add to her posthumous name.) Emperor Fei was deposed by the powerful general Huan Wen in 371. After he was then demoted to the title of Duke of Haixi, Empress Yu was also posthumously demoted to the title of Duchess of Haixi. After he died in 386, she was disinterred and reburied with her husband at his place of exile, Wu (吳縣, in modern Suzhou, Jiangsu).  References  * Book of Jin, vol. 32. * Zizhi Tongjian, vol. 101.

She was one of the original performers during the first season of Jim Henson's popular television series The Muppet Show. Biography Özker was born in Ankara, Turkey, and grew up in Farmington Hills, Michigan, USA. She received a bachelor's degree in drama from the University of Michigan in 1970. Right after graduating, she toured with the National Shakespeare Company, appearing in Hamlet (Ophelia) and The Merchant of Venice (Jessica). She moved to New York City shortly afterward to perform in numerous off- Broadway productions, such as The Master Builder, in which she portrayed Kaia Fosli. Reviews described her as \\"an Off-Broadway favorite\\" and as \\"a fire- cracker burning at both ends.\\" In 1975, she joined the Hartman Theater Company for its first production, The Government Inspector, meeting her future husband, William Bogert, in the process during the original production of The Runner Stumbles. In 1976, Özker went to England and joined the cast of The Muppet Show. As the only full-time female Muppeteer on the show at the time, she performed most of the female characters. These included: * Wanda - one- half of the singing duo Wayne and Wanda. Their \\"wholesome, uplifting and decent\\" acts, as described by Sam the Eagle, were always cut short in disastrous circumstances. * Hilda - mostly restricted to backstage appearances, Hilda was the wardrobe lady for the show with a Slavic accent. * Janice - Özker's most famous character, Janice is the guitarist for Dr. Teeth and The Electric Mayhem, as taken over from Fran Brill. Of her three main characters, only Janice survived after Özker left the show at the end of the first season. Janice was subsequently performed by Richard Hunt, Matt Vogel, Brian Henson, Tyler Bunch and, most recently, David Rudman. After performing in Henson productions The Muppet Movie and Emmet Otter's Jug-Band Christmas, Özker retired from the Muppet scene and returned to the United States to focus on her family. Her last puppeteering performance was in the 1988 production of The Warrior Ant at the Brooklyn Next Wave Festival. In 1989, Özker founded and became chairwoman of the Puppeteers Caucus, a working group within the Screen Actors Guild. Ozker was presented the Joseph C. Riley award by the Guild in 1991 in recognition of her services to the industry. Özker died on 25 February 1993, aged 44.

One of Debden's early and most bizarre experiences was when the airfield was chosen as a location for the film \\"It's in the Air\\" in which George Formby was to pilot a Hawker Fury through Hangar No. 3. The rather sharper angle of the hangars at Debden built around the tarmac apron allowed free access at both ends of the end hangar. The flying for the sequence was actually done by Flying Officer R. H. A. Lee who disappeared on 18 August 1940 when he was last seen ten miles north of Foulness Point chasing three German aircraft out to sea. =RAF Fighter Command use= The Battle of Britain. Hawker Hurricanes of No. 17 Squadron on the ground at Debden, while another comes in to land, July 1940. Hard surface runways were laid in 1940. During the early years of World War II it was a Sector Station, with an Operations Block for No.11 Group RAF during the Battle of Britain. Many different RAF units were posted to Debden, including No 1, 17, 29, 65, 73, 80, 85, 87, 111, 157, 257, 418, 504 and 601 Squadrons. The airfield was attacked several times during the Battle of Britain. The first air-raid sounded on 18 June 1940, although the first bombs were not dropped on the airfield until seven days later. Then, on 2 August, came a heavy attack which destroyed several buildings, killing five, to be followed by another severe raid on 31 August. During August and September, Debden fighters claimed seventy aircraft destroyed, thirty probables and forty-one damaged. In 1970, Peter Townsend, the commander of 85 Squadron, which operated from Debden during the Battle of Britain, published a best-selling history of the Battle, \\"Duel of Eagles.\\".Peter Townsend, Duel of Eagles, (New York, Simon and Schuster, 1970) On 28 January 1941, the station was visited by King George VI and Queen Elizabeth, and the following month by a German aircrew; it was on 4 February 1941 that a German pilot landed his aircraft and taxied to the watch office (control tower), at which point the German pilot must have realised his mistake as he took off in a hurry. During May through into September 1942 Debden was used by No. 71, 121 and 133 \\"Eagle Squadrons\\" with Spitfire V's. =United States Army Air Forces use= USAAF Personnel waiting for the return of 4th Fighter Group aircraft on the Debden Control Tower, 25 September 1943 RAF Debden - Station Area with prewar \\"C\\"- type RAF hangar.

The 4th Fighter Group flew P-47 Thunderbolts on missions between March 1943 and February 1944. The airfield was transferred on 12 September 1942 to the United States Army Air Forces Eighth Air Force. Debden was assigned USAAF designation Station 356. USAAF Station Units assigned to RAF Debden were: * 33rd Service Group : 41st and 45th Service Squadrons; HHS 33d Service Group * 18th Weather Squadron * 24th Station Complement Squadron * 225th Anti-Aircraft Artillery Searchlight Battalion * 1030th Signal Company * 1063rd Military Police Company * 1126th Quartermaster Company * 1192nd Military Police Company * 1770th Ordnance Supply & Maintenance Company * 2119th Engineer Fire Fighting Platoon * 546th Army Postal Unit 4th Fighter Group With the transfer of the airfield and the entry of the United States into the war, Americans serving in the RAF Eagle squadrons were transferred into the American ranks, with 71, 121 and 133 RAF Eagle Squadrons becoming the 4th Fighter Group. The group was under the command of the 65th Fighter Wing of the VIII Fighter Command. Aircraft of the group were identified by red around their cowlings and tails. The group consisted of the following squadrons: * 334th Fighter Squadron (QP) (Former 71 Squadron) * 335th Fighter Squadron (WD) (Former 121 Squadron) * 336th Fighter Squadron (VF) (Former 133 Squadron) The 4th Fighter Group destroyed more enemy aircraft in the air and on the ground than any other fighter group of the Eighth Air Force. The group operated first with Supermarine Spitfires but changed to Republic P-47 Thunderbolts in March 1943 and to North American P-51 Mustangs in April 1944. On numerous occasions the 4th FG escorted Boeing B-17 Flying Fortress and Consolidated B-24 Liberator bombers that were attacking factories, submarine pens, V-weapon sites, and other targets in France, the Low Countries, or Germany. The group went out sometimes with a small force of bombers to draw up the enemy's fighters so they could be destroyed in aerial combat. At other times the 4th attacked the enemy's air power by strafing and dive-bombing airfields. They also hit troops, supply depots, roads, bridges, rail lines, and trains. The unit participated in the intensive campaign against the German Air Force and aircraft industry during Big Week, 20–25 February 1944. They received a Distinguished Unit Citation for aggressiveness in seeking out and destroying enemy aircraft and in attacking enemy air airfields during the period 5 March - 24 April 1944. The 4th FG flew interdictory and counter-air missions during the invasion of Normandy in June 1944 and supported the airborne invasion of the Netherlands in September. They participated in the Battle of the Bulge, December 1944-January 1945, and provided cover for the airborne assault across the Rhine in March 1945. In October 1944, No. 616 Squadron RAF, the first RAF jet unit, had a detachment of Gloster Meteors at Debden to practise affiliation tactics with the 4th Fighter Group. With the cessation of hostilities, the group was briefly moved to RAF Steeple Morden in early July 1945, then on 10 November 1945 the group returned to the USA and was inactivated at Camp Kilmer New Jersey. =Postwar Royal Air Force use= RAF Debden was returned to Royal Air Force control on 5 September 1945. Debden became a unit of the RAF Technical Training Command, firstly, as the Empire Radio School then, in 1949, a Signals Division and later the Debden Division of the RAF Technical College, later being joined by a Bomb Disposal Unit and a Motor Transport Repair Unit. Debden became home to No. 614 Volunteer Gliding School RAF (614 VGS) in 1966. The School remained at RAF Debden until 1982 when the British Army required the airfield for tank training and the school was found a new home at RAF Wethersfield where the school opened for operations on 6 June 1982. In 1967 Debden became an overspill training centre for civilian police covered by No 5 district. From to dates are not in my possession but trained there in May 1967 On 18 October 1973 a Nissen hut, officially designated Building 210 which had been used by the 4th Fighter Group during the war was presented to the USAF to be flown to the Wright- Patterson AFB Ohio to be re-assembled and displayed in the USAF museum. The RAF Police School had moved to Debden in 1960 and the unit became The RAF Police Depot. From 1968, the Provost & Security Support Squadron was also based at Debden. In the 1960s, the Unit also trained members of the Air Force Department Constabulary (until that force was amalgamated into the Mininstry of Defence Police). On 5 June 1973, RAF Debden was subject of a Royal Review by HRH Princess Margaret. The RAF Police Dog School had moved to Debden from Netheravon in 1962. Apart from RAF Police, the Dog School also trained UK- based USAF Police to handle RAF Police Dogs. The School hosted the RAF Police Dog Demonstration Team which, apart from its appearances over many years in the UK, toured America in September 1969. In 1974, the RAF Police School moved to RAF Newton, Nottinghamshire, whilst the Dog School remained at Debden. In July 1975, the RAF Police Dog School hosted Debden's final RAF Police Dog Trials before the Dog School also moved to join the rest of RAF Police Training at RAF Newton in late Summer 1975. The station officially closed on 21 August 1975. =British Army= After the RAF left the site became Carver Barracks. Due to its postwar use, the airfield and technical site is almost completely intact from its World War II configuration, although the \\"C\\" type hangars made famous by Formby have now been demolished on the main airfield although two of these hangars have been left on the other side of the road.

The movie had a huge buildup, and viewers expected it to be another hit for the National Lampoon franchise, because it was following National Lampoon's Animal House, the company's first big-screen release in 1978. The original company consisted of the writers from the National Lampoon magazine and some of the cast from the National Lampoon Radio Hour and the stage show National Lampoon's Lemmings.National Lampoon Wiki link Reviews National Lampoon's Class Reunion suffered negative reviews on release. According to TV Guide, \\"this is a very unfunny film which was released after the successful National Lampoon's Animal House, and which died at the box office, focuses on the 10th reunion of a 1972 high-school graduating class. The plot combines both comedy and horror-slasher elements, a combination that doesn't work. A murderer is killing off class members, who are such dull, dreary creatures no one could blame him. Even Chuck Berry, who makes brief appearance singing a melody of his songs, can't save this one.\\" Christopher Tookey states, \\"Very inferior follow-up to Animal House, with remarkably tasteless basis for comedy. John Hughes can be blamed for the script, a feeble spoof of a slasher movie. Songs are used to extend running length, but even Chuck Berry seems under par.\\"  References   External links  * at MGM.com  Category:1982 films Category:1980s comedy horror films Category:ABC Motion Pictures films Category:20th Century Fox films Category:Class reunions in popular culture Category:1980s parody films Class Reunion Category:1980s serial killer films Category:American black comedy films Category:American comedy horror films Category:American films Category:Films with screenplays by John Hughes (filmmaker) Category:Parodies of horror Category:1980s black comedy films Category:1982 comedy films ","title":"National Lampoon's Class Reunion"},{"id":"3883053","text":"Kempston Rovers Football Club is a football club based in Kempston, Bedfordshire, England.

The line was organized as the Oregon Short Line Railway in 1881 as a subsidiary of the Union Pacific Railway. The Union Pacific intended the line to be the shortest route (\\"the short line\\") from Wyoming to Oregon and the Pacific Northwest. Construction was begun in 1881 at Granger, Wyoming, and completed in 1884 At Huntington, Oregon. In 1889 the line merged with the Utah & Northern Railway and a handful of smaller railroads to become the Oregon Short Line and Utah Northern Railway. Following the bankruptcy of Union Pacific in 1897, the line was taken into receivership and reorganized as the Oregon Short Line Railroad (“OSL”). The OSL became a part of the Union Pacific System in the Harriman reorganization of 1898.  Oregon Short Line Railway  Oregon Historical Quarterly vol. 1. The Oregon Short Line Railway was organized on April 14, 1881. The line started from the Union Pacific main line in Granger, Wyoming, and reached Montpelier, Idaho, on August 5, 1882, and then to McCammon, Idaho, in the Fall of 1882. Between McCammon and Pocatello the line was shared with fellow Union Pacific subsidiary Utah & Northern's grade by adding a third rail to the narrow gauge track to accommodate the cars. The line from Pocatello to Huntington, Oregon, was completed in late 1884. Access to Portland, Oregon, was on track leased from the Oregon Railway and Navigation Company.http://imnh.isu.edu/digitalatlas/geog/rrt/part3/chp7/57.htm The line was essential because the Union Pacific main line ended in Utah where it met the Central Pacific Railroad, which by that time was part of the Southern Pacific Railroad. The Southern Pacific had built tracks as far east as El Paso, Texas, and would, in 1883, become a transcontinental railroad in its own right. The Southern Pacific then started routing traffic to the southern line, cutting off the Union Pacific, which needed other access to the Pacific coast. The Oregon Short Line also was meant to halt the OR&N;'s continued eastward expansion at the Idaho-Oregon border.  Oregon Short Line and Utah Northern Railway  Cover of To Geyserland, an Oregon Short Line Railroad brochure. In 1889, the Oregon Short Line Railway merged with Utah & Northern Railway and 6 other smaller railroads to form the Oregon Short Line and Utah Northern Railway. In 1890 the company finished converting the original Utah & Northern line from narrow gauge to , a process that U&N; had started as early as 1885. On October 13, 1893, the OSL&UN; went into receivership with the rest of the Union Pacific holdings. The Oregon Short Line Railroad was incorporated in February 1897 and purchased the property of the OSL&UN; later that month. On March 15, the OSL took possession of the line and started operating. The OSL was independent for a short period of time until October 1898 when the newly reformed Union Pacific Railroad took control of a majority of the board of directors. During the early part of the 20th century the railroad publicized tours of Yellowstone National Park by way of a spur constructed from Idaho Falls, Idaho, to West Yellowstone, Montana. In 1938, Union Pacific began consolidating operations and leased for operation a number of its subsidiaries including the Oregon Short Line. The railroad operated under the lease until December 30, 1987, when the OSL was fully merged into the Union Pacific Railroad.

The club plays in the . History The club was formed in 1898 as Blisworth Football Club. The club joined the United Counties League Division Three in 1970. After two seasons, the division was renamed Division Two. After spending eight years in the United Counties League, Blisworth dropped back to local football. They re-joined the United Counties League in Division One in 1987, and remained there until resigning in 2006. Their highest league position was third placing in 1987-88.

Although unknown at the time the 2014/2015 season turned out to be the foundations for future success as Manager Broadbent made some shrewd summer signings to bolster his existing squad of young talent. Although narrowly missing out on League success to Corby Eagles and losing in the Semi final of the Junior cup to United Counties League winners Northampton Spencer there were signs that success wasn't too far in the distance. The 2015/16 season saw Blisworth take a stronghold of the Premier league and take the title comfortably.

Wood and Sid Williamson, former members of Combat 18, British National Party (BNP), National Front (NF) and the White Nationalist Party, as a splinter group from the Nationalist Alliance. Its founding member Eddy Morrison left the BPP and joined the NF in 2009. The party dissolved in 2013. Platform The party was committed to a number of ideals including the implementation of the \\"Fourteen Words\\", and the expulsion of non-whites and Jews. It also expressed support for loyalism in Northern Ireland. The BPP described its economic policies as establishing a \\"White Workers' State\\" as an alternative to Marxism and capitalism and favoured nationalising the media and banks, supporting small businesses, while dismantling multinational ones, and recriminalising homosexuality. The BPP also denied the Holocaust. History The BPP was led by Kevin Watmough and was largely dedicated to the legacies of British Nazis who pre-date the party, such as Arnold Leese, John Beckett and Colin Jordan. On 27 October 2005, the party officially registered with the Electoral Commission as BPP - Putting Britons First.BPP Officially Registered \\\\- The BPP initially had two publications: Vanguard, which came out every month, and Imperium, a quarterly magazine that was more theoretical. Both have ceased publication. On 17 October 2005, the BPP was proscribed to members of the BNP. The BPP stood a small number of candidates in the May 2006 council elections without winning any seats. The party did not contest the following year's elections as they claimed to have declared a 'truce' with the BNPD, Williams, 'The Rest of the Right', Searchlight, May 2007, p.10 but continue to oppose the BNP for its rejection of Nazism. The BPP was also critical of the British First Party for what it claimed was that group's attempts to conceal its Nazism and behave as a 'populist' party. Goole party member Martyn Gilleard was convicted in June 2008 of possessing child pornography, illegal weapons and explosive devices. Gilleard was sentenced to 13 years in prison and has since reportedly converted to Islam. When police searched his house they found 39,000 indecent images of children and an arsenal of weapons, bombs and far-right literature.Gerry Gable, \\"Former would-be gun importer jailed for sex abuse\\", Searchlight, May 2012 He was expelled from the BPP when the police revealed he had also been arrested for possession of child pornography. The party supported Simon Sheppard during his arrest, trial and imprisonment on incitement to racial hatred charges for material on his Heretical Press site. The group attempted to expand into Northern Ireland under the name of the Ulster British People's Party. It undertook leafleting campaigns in support of a return of the shoot-to-kill policyBrian Caffrey, \\"Police urged to investigate fascist group calls for 'shoot to kill' policy\\", Irish News, 1 April 2009 and against the presence of Roma people in the Village area of south Belfast.'Romanian gypsies beware beware. Loyalist C18 are coming to beat you like a baiting bear', The Guardian, 21 June 2009 A further campaign against Polish immigration was condemned by the Democratic Unionist Party MP Gregory Campbell, who called for a crackdown on the BPP in Northern Ireland.\\"Calls for crackdown on race hate material in Northern Ireland\\", Belfast Telegraph, 23 July 2009 Although the BPP website avowedly stated that it supported Northern Ireland's continuing status within the UK, it also offered coverage to Ulster Nation, a pro-independence journal. The only BPP member to have stood for election was David Jones (who was the former BPP Commissioner) who three years running contested the Todmorden ward of Calderdale Council, in West Yorkshire, where he is a resident. In May 2010, he received 283 votes (5.0%) of the poll,Calderdale Council: Election of District Councillors 2010 - 06/05/2010: Todmorden (Accessed 5 January 2013) in May 2011, 203 votes (5.5%)Calderdale Council: Election of District Councillors 2011 - 05/05/2011: Todmorden (Accessed 5 January 2013) and in May 2012, 257 votes (8.5%).Calderdale Council: Election of District Councillors 2012 - 03/05/2010: Todmorden.

The party was \\"voluntarily deregistered\\" with the Electoral Commission on 25 July 2013.Electoral Commission registration database, reference no. PP520 (Accessed 27 October 2013) Watmough dissolved the party and called on all members and supporters to give their support to the National Front which he believes can create a viable white working class backlash in the United Kingdom.

It generally airs overnights on many non-commercial and a handful of commercial classical music stations. However, the service is operated 24 hours a day and is used by some stations during the day to augment their schedules. It was co-created by a partnership between Minnesota Public Radio and Public Radio International to fulfill the need for a comprehensive classic music service for stations to supplement their schedules. As part of this partnership, the service is produced by American Public Media and distributed by Public Radio International. It began operation on December 1, 1995. Unlike most mainstream classical music stations, Classical 24 adheres to a \\"clock\\" that typically consists of one or two short selections at the beginning of the hour, followed by a longer work such as a symphony, and then a short piece or two to close the hour. A brief pre-recorded \\"sound bite\\" interview with the composer, conductor or soloist of the next piece is sometimes played immediately prior to the piece, as an introduction. Classical 24 also requires two breaks per hour during the day at around 20 and 40 minutes past (one per hour during the overnight Music Through the Night component) and a mandatory break at the top of the hour for announcements and station identification. The service also has a five-minute \\"cutaway\\" following this top of the hour break during the day for subscribers to air news programming (in many cases the standard NPR newscast, as a few NPR member stations use Classical 24); this time is filled with a short musical selection for affiliates who choose not to run any newscast. Classical 24 employs live hosts around the clock instead of using voicetracking. To make the sound as \\"local\\" as possible, there are no identifications given to the listener that they are listening to Classical 24. Only the host's name is given. For stations to automate breaks, a special decoder must be purchased and used. In 2000, the Minneapolis Star Tribune reported that the average selection on Classical 24 was 9.5 minutes, in contrast to then-rival WCAL's average selection length of 15 minutes. Minnesota Public Radio's FM flagship station for classical music, KSJN in Minneapolis, currently offers a full-time Classical 24 feed on its HD2 sub- channel. WNIU, broadcasting from Northern Illinois University in DeKalb, Illinois, is another full power FM that carries Classical 24 on a full-time basis. After November 2013, KUHA (now KXNG) in Houston (broadcasting from the University of Houston at the time) carried Classical 24 for a significantly increased portion of its schedule after discontinuing the use of local hosts during the daytime hours. Wisconsin Public Radio partially syndicates Classical 24 on their All Classical Network service, which airs on 13 different HD2 sub-channels throughout the State of Wisconsin.

It passed through various owners before being bought in 1834 by Maximilian, Duke in Bavaria, father of \\"Sisi\\", the future Empress Elisabeth (wife of Emperor Franz Joseph I of Austria); thus, the castle is best remembered today as her childhood home and favourite vacation retreat. The castle served as a seat of the Dukes in Bavaria, a junior branch of the House of Wittelsbach, until it became derelict after 1920. Luitpold Emanuel Ludwig Maria (1890-1973) sold it, as well as Biederstein Castle in Munich-Schwabing, in order to build his late romantic Schloss Ringberg.

Part of the chorus: \\"Boys and girls together, me and Mamie O'Rourke / Tripped the light fantastic / On the sidewalks of New York.\\" Those lyrics were probably inspired by \\"The Ballet Girl\\", a song popularized by Tony Pastor at his Bowery \\"Opera House\\" in the mid-19th century that had as the chorus: \\"While she danced on her light fantastic toe, / Round the stage she used to go; / Had it not been for a man named Joe, / She might have belonged to me.\\"Tony Pastor's 201 Bowery Songster, 1867.

Located 15 kilometres west of Firouzkouh, 9 kilometres north of the Firouzkouh-Damavand road in Tehran Province, it is a narrow mountain pass in the Alborz range. The narrow gorge was created by a perennial stream which comes down from a series of waterfalls upstream. Slightly lower, in a hilly area, the stream provided a patch of lush grazing land within the mountains. Until the 20th century the area was a royal hunting reserve, populated by various wildlife. The Qajar Persia king Fath Ali Shah (1772 – 1834) maintained a hunting lodge there. To commemorate his hunts, Fath Ali Shah ordered the carving of a rock relief in the mid way point of the pass, emulating Sassanian examples. There are ruins of a Qajar guard tower at the top of one of entrances to the gorge.

The population in the 2001 census was 2,307. Due to its scenic location, it has seen growth in the number of holiday homes. Unlike many country towns in New Zealand, Mount Somers' economy has not been solely agricultural. Coal, clay, sand, and limestone have been mined in the hills behind the town, and from 1885 until 1968 the community and its industries were served by the Mount Somers Branch railway from the Main South Line. From 1889 to 1957 an extension ran to Springburn, and the branch was sometimes known as the Springburn Branch. From Mount Somers railway station a private bush tramway ran into the hills behind the town, providing access to the various industrial operations there. Relics of both the railway and tramway are still visible today. Mount Somers is famous amongst the international experimental and underground music communities as it is the home of Peter King and his lathe cut record business. Peter hand cuts records onto polycarbonate plastic one at a time using an old BBC lathe and also home made record cutting heads.

The word tranquillity appears in numerous texts ranging from the religious writings of Buddhism, where the term passaddhi refers to tranquillity of the body, thoughts and consciousness on the path to enlightenment, to an assortment of policy and planning guidance documents, where interpretation of the word is typically linked to engagement with the natural environment. Benefits Psychological being in a tranquil or \\"restorative\\" environment allows individuals to take respite from the periods of sustained \\"directed attention\\" that characterise modern living. In developing their Attention Restoration Theory (ART), Kaplan and KaplanKaplan R. and Kaplan, S. (1989). The Experience of Nature. New York: Cambridge University Press. proposed that recovery from cognitive overload could most effectively be achieved by engaging with natural restorative environments, that are away from daily distractions and have the extent and mystery that allows the imagination to wander, thereby enabling individuals to engage effortlessly with their surroundings. The theory works on the principle that the amount of reflection possible within such an environment depends upon the type of cognitive engagement, i.e. fascination; that the environment holds. \\"Soft fascination\\" is deemed to occur when there is enough interest in the surroundings to hold attention but not so much that it compromises the ability to reflect. In essence, soft fascination, which has been taken by HerzogHerzog, T. R. and Bosley, P. J. (1992). Tranquillity and preference as affective qualities of natural environments. Journal of Environmental Psychology 12, 115–127. and PheasantRobert J. Pheasant, Mark N. Fisher, Greg R. Watts, David J. Whitaker and Kirill V. Horoshenkov. (2010). The importance of auditory-visual interaction in the construction of tranquil space. Journal of Environmental Psychology 30, 501–509. as a reasonable term to describe tranquillity, provides a pleasing level of sensory input that involves no cognitive effort other than removing oneself from an overcrowded mental space. =Enjoyment= For many, the chance to experience tranquillity is what makes the countryside different from cities. In a survey by the United Kingdom Department for Environment, Food and Rural Affairs (DEFRA) 58% of people said that tranquillity was the most positive feature of the countryside. =Health= In contrast to \\"soft fascination\\", \\"directed attention\\" requires a significant amount of cognitive effort and it is known that prolonged periods of sustained mental activity can lead to directed attention fatigue. This condition has the potential to significantly affect performance and bring about negative emotions, irritability and decreased sensitivity to interpersonal cues.Hartig, T., Kaiser, F. G. & Bowler, P. A. (1997). Further development of a measure of perceived environmental restorativeness. Working paper 5, Institute for Housing Research, Uppsala University, Sweden. As the incidence of mental illness continues to rise,Berglund, B., Lindvall, T and Schwela, D. H. (1999). World Health Organisation guidelines for community noise. there is growing evidence that exposure to natural environments can make a significant contribution to health and wellbeing. Mounting evidence shows, that exposure to nature contributes to physical and psychological wellbeing, such as the review carried out by Louv,Richard Louv. (2008). Last Child in the Woods: Saving our Children from Nature Deficit Disorder. Algonquin Press that found evidence of \\"nature-deficit-disorder\\" in children, which suggests that the importance of being able to engage with restorative environments applies across a wide age range. Others report that natural tranquil surroundings have profound physiological effects on people suffering from stress. For example, UllrichR. S. Ulrich, F. Simons, B. D. Losito, E. Fiorito, M. A. Miles and M. Zelson. (1991). Stress recovery during exposure to natural and urban environments. Journal of Environmental Psychology 11, 201–230. found that stress (as measured by blood pressure, muscle tension and skin conductance response), induced by showing videos of workplace injuries, improved significantly quicker following further viewing if videos included natural surroundings rather than busy traffic or shopping scenes. A recent study has demonstrated the benefits of simulating such environments for pain relief during bone marrow aspirate and biopsy.biopsyLechtzin N, Busse A M, Smith M T, Grossman S, Nesbit S, Diette G B. (2010). Journal of Alternative and Complementary Medicine 16(9), 965–972. =Economic= Since seeking tranquillity is an important reason why many people visit the countryside, the presence of tranquil areas helps boost rural tourism. Since rural tourism in the UK directly supports 380,000 jobs and £13.8 billion annually to the economy, and a recent survey showed that tranquillity is the main reason why 49% of visitors go are attracted to the countryside, one can conclude that tranquillity is worth 186,200 jobs and £6.76 billion a year to the economy. Tranquillity research Natural settings that effortlessly engage our attention are typically associated with soft fascination and with the analysis of tranquillity and preference published by Herzog and Bosely (1992). In this study, the authors attempted to distinguish empirically between the constructs of tranquillity and preference as affective qualities of natural environments. Motivated by ART, from which they took tranquillity as a reasonable term to describe soft fascination, they produced definitions for each component. Tranquillity they defined as \\"how much you think this setting is a quiet, peaceful place, a good place to get away from everyday life\\", and preference as \\"how much you like this setting for whatever reason\\". Subjects were asked to score the following visual settings: mountains, deserts, fields / forests and waterscapes against the two target variables, tranquillity and preference, and four descriptor variables: mistiness, unstructured openness, focus and surface calmness. Tranquillity and preference were positively correlated across all settings with tranquillity scoring higher ratings in the field / forest, waterscape and mountain categories, whilst rushing water had the highest rating in the preference category. Analysis of the results identified three physical features that help explain the apparent split between tranquillity and preference. These were; mistiness, unstructured openness; which refers to how open the scene is and how difficult it is to establish a sense of depth or distance, and surface calmness. Mistiness and unstructured openness tended to depress preference relative to tranquillity whilst surface calmness tended to enhance it. Herzog and BarnesHerzog, T. R. & Barnes, G. J. (1999). Tranquillity and preference revisited. Journal of Environmental Psychology 19, 171–181. conducted a follow up study in which deserts and waterscapes were included in the setting types. In 2000, Herzog and ChernickHerzog, T. R. and Chernick, K. K. (2000). Tranquility and Danger in Urban and Natural Settings. Journal of Environmental Psychology, 20, 29–39. conducted further research into the tranquillity construct when they investigated the relationship between tranquillity and danger in urban and rural settings. The key results that emerged from this research were that \\"setting care\\", which relates to how safe we feel in a particular setting, is more salient for judgments of danger in urban settings than natural ones and that openness was a significant predictor of danger but not of tranquillity. The authors concluded therefore that tranquillity and danger should not simply be viewed as polar opposites, but like preference and tranquillity as distinct constructs. =The role of audio-visual interaction within the tranquillity construct= Within tranquillity studies, much of the emphasis has been placed on understanding the role of vision in the perception of natural environments, which is probably not surprising, considering that upon first viewing a scene its configurational coherence can be established with incredible speed. Indeed, scene information can be captured in a single glanceOliva, A. & Torralba, A. (2006). Building the gist of a scene: The role of global image features and recognition. Progress in Brain Research 155 (2), 23–36. and the gist of a scene determined in as little as 100ms.Dobel, C. & Gumnoir, H. (2006). Describing scenes hardly seen. Acta Psychologica 125, 129 – 143. The speed of processing of complex natural images was tested by Thorpe et al.Thorpe, S., Fize, D. & Marlot, C. (1996). Speed of processing in the human visual system. Nature 381, 520–522. using colour photographs of a wide range of animals (mammals, birds, reptiles and fish), in their natural environments, mixed with distracters that included pictures of forests, mountains, lakes, buildings and fruit. During this experiment, subjects were shown an image for 20ms and asked to determine whether it contained an animal or not. The electrophysiological brain responses obtained in this study showed that a decision could be made within 150ms of the image being seen, indicating the speed at which cognitive visual processing occurs. However, audition, and in particular the individual components that collectively comprise the soundscape, a term coined by SchaferSchafer, R. M. (1977). The Soundscape: Our sonic environment and the tuning of the world. Destiny Books Rochester, Vermont. to describe the ever-present array of sounds that constitute the sonic environment, also significantly inform the various schemata used to characterise differing landscape types. This interpretation is supported by the auditory reaction times, which are 50 to 60ms faster than that of the visual modality.Jaśkowski, P., Jaroszyk, F., & Hojan-Jezierska, D. (1990). Temporal-order judgement and reaction time for stimuli of different modalities. Psychol Research 52, 35–38. It is also known that sound can alter visual perceptionShams, L., Kanutani, S. & Shimojo, S. (2002). Visual illusion induced by sound. Journal of Cognitive Brain Research 14, 147–152. and that under certain conditions areas of the brain involved in processing auditory information can be activated in response to visual stimuli. Research conducted by Pheasant et al. has shown that when individuals make tranquillity assessments based on a uni-modal auditory or visual sensory input, they characterise the environment by drawing upon a number of key landscape and soundscape characteristics. For example, when making assessments in response to visual-only stimuli the percentage of water, flora and geological features present within a scene, positively influence how tranquil a location is perceived to be. Likewise when responding to uni-modal auditory stimuli, the perceived loudness of biological sounds positively influences the perception of tranquillity, whilst the perceived loudness of mechanical sounds have a negative effect. However, when presented with bi-modal auditory-visual stimuli the individual soundscape and landscape components alone no longer influenced the perception of tranquillity. Rather configurational coherence was provided by the percentage of natural and contextual features present within the scene and the equivalent continuous sound pressure level (LAeq). =Predicting tranquillity= Researchers at the Bradford Centre for Sustainable Environments have developed a methodology by which the perceived tranquillity rating (TR) of an amenity area such as park, green or urban square can be measured, on a 0–10 scale.Robert J Pheasant, Kirill V Horoshenkov and Greg R Watts. Tranquillity Rating prediction tool (TRAPT). Institute of Acoustics – Acoustics Bulletin, 35 (6), November/December 2010.R. J. Pheasant., K. V. Horoshenkov., G. R. Watts and B. T. Barrett. (2008). The acoustic and visual factors influencing the construction of tranquil space in urban and rural environments: Tranquil Spaces – Quiet places? J. Acoust. Soc. Am. 123(3), 1446–1457.R. J. Pheasant., G. R. Watts. and K. V. Horoshenkov. (2009). Validation of a tranquillity rating prediction tool, J. ACTA Acustica United with Acustica. 95(6), 1024м1031. The method involves the assessment of average daytime noise levels Lday (usually traffic noise) and the measurement of the percentage of natural and contextual features NCF contained within the visual scene. The latter includes the percentage area in the visual scene occupied by natural features in the landscape such as vegetation, water and geological features, e.g. exposed rock outcrops, and contextual features. These contextual elements include listed buildings, religious and historic buildings, landmarks, monuments and elements of the landscape, such as traditional farm buildings, that directly contribute to the visual context of the natural environment. Lastly, the equation includes moderating factors (MF) that can influence the perception of tranquillity in either a positive, or a negative way: : TR = 9.68 + 0.041 NCF − 0.146 Lday + MF. These moderating factors are not expected to be large and because they are relatively difficult to quantify they are the subject of ongoing research. One potentially effective solution to improving tranquillity, is to mask traffic noise or distract attention with an attractive water sound. A previous experiment has demonstrated that water generated sounds have the potential to improve the perceived tranquillity of gardens blighted by noise.G. R. Watts, R. J. Pheasant, K. V. Horoshenkov and L. Ragonesi. (2009). Measurement and subjective assessment of water generated sounds. Acta Acustica united with Acustica, 95, 1032–1039. A further study has demonstrated that litter has the potential to degrade an environment such that the tranquillity rating drops on average by one scale point.G. R. Watts, R. J. Pheasant and K. V. Horoshenkov. Validation of tranquillity rating method, Proceedings of the Institute of Acoustics & Belgium Acoustical Society, Noise in the Built Environment, Ghent, 29–30 April 2010. This bi-modal relationship is supported by work recently carried out by SCANLab at the University of Sheffield, using fMRI neuro- imaging techniques.M.D.Hunter., S. B. Eickhoff., R. J. Pheasant., M. J. Douglas., G. R. Watts., T. F. D. Farrow., D. Hyland., J. Kang., I. D. Wilkinson., K. V. Horoshenkov and P. W. R. Woodruff. (2010). The state of tranquillity: Subjective perception is shaped by contextual modulation of auditory connectivity. NeuroImage 53(2), 611–18. This study demonstrated for the first time the significant differences in effective connectivity between areas of the brain, namely the auditory cortex and the medial pre-frontal cortex, under tranquil and non-tranquil conditions. Specifically the medial pre-frontal cortex receives significantly enhanced contributions from the auditory cortex when presented with a tranquil visual scene compared with non- tranquil visual stimuli. =Mapping tranquillity= 2007 Tranquillity map of England. Green areas denote very tranquil areas, whereas red areas denote areas with much less tranquillity. The first method of mapping tranquillity was developed by Simon Rendel of ASH Consulting for a Department of Transport study in 1991. This led to the production of a set of Tranquil Area maps covering England, produced by Rendel and ASH Consulting and published by the Campaign to Protect Rural England (CPRE) and the former Countryside Commission. In these maps tranquil areas were defined as places sufficiently far from the visual or noise intrusion of development or traffic to be considered unspoilt by urban influences. More sophisticated mapping techniques are now available following work by researchers at Northumbria University, Newcastle University, and CPRE. Maps have been produced for the whole of England that show the tranquillity score of Ordnance Survey Grid derived 500mx500m squares. The tranquillity rating for these is based on 44 different factors that add to or detract from people’s feelings of tranquillity. Presentation given by Andrew Oliver on Tranquillity to the University of Surrey, retrieved 2 Nov 2007 These factors were defined following extensive public consultations. Saving Tranquil Places, CPRE report on Tranquillity, retrieved 2 Nov 2007. The new methodology uses advanced modelling techniques to look at the diffusion of the impact of these factors over distance, taking into account the terrain of the land. For example, the tranquillity increases gradually the further one is from a busy road, but increases more sharply if the road is hidden in a cutting. The mapping process was developed by Northumbria and Newcastle Universities. The dark green areas represent those with the highest composite tranquillity score; dark red areas have the lowest composite tranquillity score (i.e., are least tranquil). =Stimuli with positive impacts on tranquillity= * a natural landscape, including woodland * presence of rivers, streams, lakes or the sea * birds and other wildlife * wide open spaces * clear open night sky with/without moon * beach in a unique location * open field, flora etc. with gentle to moderate wind flow =Examples of stimuli having negative impacts on tranquillity= * Motorised transport: cars, motorcycle, trains and aircraft – and roads and railways * light pollution * large numbers of people * pylons, power lines, masts and wind turbines * noise Note: This cartographic study showed that tranquillity is not the absence of all noise, activity and buildings. Indeed, it found that many rural activities, such as farming and hiking, and natural noises such as birdsong and cows lowing, enhance people’s experience of tranquillity.

Miller, BBC Pronouncing Dictionary of British Names (London: Oxford UP, 1971), p. 149. ) is a village in Royal Deeside, Aberdeenshire, Scotland which lies about west of Aberdeen. It is situated on the A980, about north-west of Banchory, and was once served by the Great North of Scotland Railway. With a population of around 1400, it is one of the larger villages in Deeside. The name Torphins may come from the Gaelic Torr Fionn, meaning fair/white hill, or as a corruption of Tor Feithachan, meaning hill of the bogs. Another less likely namesake is Thorfinn Sigurdsson, Earl of Orkney, who might have passed through the area due to his partnership with Macbeth. Amenities The village has many facilities including a primary school (with about 250 pupils attending each year), a large park with play area, a car dealer, two tennis courts, a bowling green and a doctor's surgery. There are also a variety of shops in Torphins including a charity shop, a Scotmid store, a funeral directors, a Chinese takeaway and a chemist. There is a Church of Scotland church, which is part of the Mid Deeside United Churches alongside those in Kincardine O'Neil and Lumphanan. Torphins also has its own Town Hall - the Learney Hall. It also has a public house/Indian restaurant, the Learney Arms Indian, which was originally part of a hotel. The hotel and pub was closed with plans to turn the building into a residential dwelling, despite local objection. The pub was later reopened but the hotel remained closed. The pub closed again briefly before being converted into an Indian restaurant. The hotel, rebranded as The Gatsby, also reopened at some point. Torphins was home to a War Memorial Maternity Hospital. As a result, many notable people from Deeside have been born in Torphins. The building, however, has recently become a GP clinic, and no longer offers maternity facilities. Walkers Shortbread was founded by Joseph Walker at age 21 in 1898 at the former modest bakery on Craigour Road. He took out a loan of £50 from the bank to open the bakery which bloomed and is now an internationally renowned shortbread company. There is a 9-hole golf course located about a mile outside of Torphins. Public transport The Stagecoach Bluebird 201 and 202 buses provide service to Aberdeen. There are other infrequent connections on the 413, and the Royal Mail PB74 postbus. Torphins railway station on the Deeside Railway served the village from 1859 to 1966. Sport Torphins is home to the local amateur football team, Torphins AFC, though the team play their home games in Kincardine O'Neil due to the limited size of Torphins' public park. Torphins also has a tennis club, a lawn bowls club and a seasonal curling rink.

Life and musical career He was born in Norwich, the son of James Hook, a razor- grinder and cutler. He displayed a remarkable musical talent at an early age, playing the harpsichord by the age of four and performing concertos in public at age six. He began performing regularly by the time he was 10 years old, including benefit concerts. He held many jobs to earn money, including teaching, composing, transcribing music and tuning keyboard instruments. Sometime between June 1763 and February 1764 Hook moved to London.McGairl, Grove Online There he became the organist at White Conduit House, Pentonville, one of the tea gardens that were popular in 18th-century London. He worked as an organist, teacher and composer, and gained a reputation for composing vocal music. He married the artist and writer Elizabeth Jane Madden on 29 May 1766, at St. Pancras Old Church. They had two sons, James (1772–1828) and Theodore Edward (1788–1841). Hook was appointed organist and composer to Marylebone Gardens in 1768. In addition to his performances as an organist, and occasionally on the harpsichord, he was now invited to perform concertos between the main works in the theatres, and his short musical entertainments and comic operas were being produced for the pleasure gardens and in the London theatres. He was appointed organist of St Johns Horselydown, Bermondsey, in 1776, and frequently played concerts on newly built organs, both in London and in nearby counties, often playing his own compositions. He was highly successful as a teacher of organ and harpsichord. Hook remained at Marylebone Gardens until the end of the 1773 season, and a year later was engaged in a similar position at Vauxhall Gardens. Hook had a pupil then named Margaret Thornton and 1778 when she was singing Hook's songs in Vauxhall Gardens. She sang his songs there each summer until 1780. Thornton returned to Vauxhall as Margeret Martyr and Hook worked there until 1820. Throughout these years he composed operas and other musical works, most of which were produced at Drury Lane and Covent Garden Theatres. He frequently collaborated with family members. His wife Elizabeth wrote the libretto for the opera The Double Disguise (1784). His son James provided librettos for Jack of Newbury (1795) and Diamond Cut Diamond (1797), while Thomas Edward composed librettos for at least eight operas. On 18 October 1805 Hook's first wife, Elizabeth Jane Madden, died. A year later, on 4 November 1806, he married his second wife, Harriet Horncastle James.The Annual Register ... of 1806 reports the marriage of \\"James Hook, esq. of Charlotte-Street, Bedford-Square, to Miss Harriet Horncastle James, daughter of Joseph J. esq.\\" It was at this time that he produced his best work, Tekeli, or the Siege of Montgatz, the life and adventure of Imre Thököly. In 1820 he unexpectedly left his position at Vauxhall, after almost a half century of service, and he died seven years later in Boulogne.

History On 12 July 1919 Edward Reynolds established the ONs Association in memory of the 94 members of staff, sixth formers and leavers who had lost their lives in the First World War. Reynolds wanted former pupils to maintain friendships and to continue playing sport, and he set up the club after a cricket match between recent leavers and the school first XI was played. The football section was founded as Chenecks FC in 1946 under the guidance of well-known Coroner Sergeant of the Borough Police, George Lloyd. The club was formed to enable boys at the rugby playing Northampton Grammar School to play football.http://football.mitoo.co.uk/ClubList.cfm?fmTeamID=188276&LeagueCode;=ucl2011 The club's unusual names is derived from the School Houses, Chipseys, Spencer, Beckett and St Crispins. The club became members of the Northampton Minor League playing at under 17 level, and when the boys were too old for youth football the club joined the Town League in 1950, playing at Abington Park. In 1960 the Old Northamptonians association invited the club to become one of their sports sections, thus Chenecks became ON Chenecks and relocated to the Billing Road sports ground. They joined the United Counties Football League in 1969, and are still members of that league, in Division One. During that time, they have always been members of the lowest division of the league, which has successively been known as Division Three, Division Two and Division One. The club has twice won the Division One Championship (in 1977-78 and 1979–80),http://www.fchd.info/ON-CHENE.HTM but their ground has not been sufficiently developed to enable them to take promotion to the Premier Division. The lack of facilities at their ground is also the reason they have not been able to participate in any F.A. national competitions. Chenecks beat Tam O'Shanter from Coventry to win the 1985 Daventry Charity Cup final and in 1994 they were Northants Junior Cup runners-up, losing 1-0 to Vanaid. In 1996 they lost 4-0 to Cogenhoe in the Daventry Charity Cup final having beaten Southern League Rothwell Town 1-0 away en route to the final. In the 2009-10 season the club won its first major honor in the last twenty years under the guidance of Andy Marks when they picked up the Junior Cup with a 1 - 0 victory over local rivals Silbey at Nene Park. The 2010-11 season started with a change at the helm when rookie manager Graham Cottle accepted the vacant manager's position. During 2014-15 season the club installed floodlights at the ground, the inclusion of other ground improvements (such as a turnstile) allowed them to compete in F.A. national competitions. The 2015-16 season, under the continued management of Graham Cottle, Chenecks finished as runners up in the United Counties Division 1. As ground improvements (driven by the current Chairman Eddie Slinn) had been made during the season promotion was granted to the United Counties League Premier Division for the first time in the club's history. The promotion also meant that they were allowed to play in the FA Cup for the first time. 2017-18, after a 2nd stable season in the United Counties Premier Division Graham Cottle decided to end his 8-year reign at the club. finishing as one of the most successful managers at the club to date. His replacement for the new season has come from within the club as Eddie Slinn decided to promote reserve team manager Ben Foster into the role.

The international community considers Israeli settlements in the West Bank illegal under international law. According to human rights organization B'Tselem, the state of Israel itself acknowledges that much of the Ofra civilian settlement is built on privately owned Palestinian land, which is unlawful according to Israeli law.'HCJ to state: Demolish nine structures in the settlement of Ofra,' B'tselem 9 February 2015:'Unlike in other cases concerning illegal Israeli construction on Palestinian land in the West Bank, the state claimed in this petition that due to “special circumstances”, the usual priorities for enforcement of planning and building laws did not apply in this case. The “special circumstances”, the state explained, were that most structures in Ofra had been unlawfully erected on privately-owned Palestinian land, i.e. their status was almost identical to that of the nine structures under examination. The state’s problematic argument was that as almost the entire settlement of Ofra had been built on privately-owned Palestinian land, there was no justification to demolish those particular nine structures – although they were new and the petition was filed before they were completed.' In August 2016, the military governorate admitted to the Israeli High Court of Justice that a large portion of Ofra, totalling 45 dunams, was built on land privately owned by Palestinians prior to the occupation, including areas \\"located in the heart of the settlement\\".http://www.haaretz.com/israel- news/.premium-1.735915?v=133866A2397A996C6FC7A0BCFEBB690F Following the ruling of the High Court that Israeli homes in this area were illegal, the state has undertaken steps with the goal of restituting the land back to its private Palestinian owners. Following the successful effort to demolish the settlement of Amona, Silwad Mayor Abdul Rahman Saleh signaled that he would petition the High Court on behalf of Ofra landowners with the goal of evicting Israeli settlers there.

The name was taken for its biblical aura from a town mentioned in the Book of Joshua: Joshua 18:23.Gershom Gorenberg, 'The Accidental Empire: Israel and the Birth of the Settlements, 1967-1977, Henry Holt & Co., 2006 p.312-318 Originally established on the site of a former Jordanian military base, Israeli civilians moved into surrounding areas formerly inhabited by Palestinians and built permanent and temporary structures there, creating the settlement of Ofra. The establishing group from Gush Emunim first obtained jobs at a nearby military base on Mount Ba'al Hatzor. They established a work camp in the abandoned barracks of a Jordanian army base. They then brought in their families and raised an Israeli flag. Though opposed by then Prime Minister Yitzhak Rabin, Ofra was given political backing by Shimon Peres, then defense minister in Rabin's government, and by his settlement adviser Moshe Netzer.Akiva Eldar, Vice PM: Ofra settlement homes built on private Palestinian land. Haaretz, 8 April 2008 After the Labour Party was defeated by the Likud Party in the 1977 Israeli election, the new government recognized Ofra as a community, paving the way for expansion into the surrounding hills.Nir Shalev, The Ofra Settlement - An unauthorized Outpost.

Summary It was designed as an \\"island\\" for a selected homogenous population, where all members would share the same \\"ideological-social background.\\"Gorenberg, The Accidental Empire, p.352. Many institutions of the Jewish settlers in the West Bank were first located or established in Ofra, including the Yesha CouncilIan S.Lustick, For the Land and the Lord: Jewish Fundamentalism in Israel, Council on Foreign Relations, 1988 p.57. and the Nekuda monthly magazine, founded and edited by Israel Harel.John Wallach, Janet Wallach, Still small voices, Carol Pub.

Geography Bnei Akiva youth club in Ofra Ofra is located east of the Israeli West Bank barrier, circa 25 kilometers from the Green line, and 20 kilometers north of the Green Line in Jerusalem.See maps on B'Tselem website and on Wikimedia Commons It is situated in the mountain-range area at 850–900 meters above sea level. The climate is mediterranean-mountainous. Cold and humid winters with several days of snow almost every year and a rain yearly average of about 750 millimeters (29.5 inches). The summers are dry and mild. Ofra lies in a karstic region, with several stalactite caves and dolines. The Center for Cave Research (HaMerkaz Lekheker Me'arot) is located in Ofra. The settlement is divided into three main neighborhoods: Neve David, Giv'at Tzvi and the core of the settlement, which is itself divided into four sections. In addition there are three caravan neighborhoods and another neighborhood (\\"HaShkhuna HaZmanit\\", lit. the temporary neighborhood) of houses belong to the Ofra Cooperative Society, rented mostly to newcomers including a community of Bnei Menashe from Manipur and Mizoram. Ofra borders the Palestinian villages and towns of Ein Yabrud, Silwad, Deir Jarir, Rammun, Deir Dibwan and At-Taybeh. The last is believed to be the site of biblical Ofra. It is often known locally as Ein Yabrud Heights.Michael Feige, 'The Settlement of Ofra: Ritualizing normalcy,' in M. Feige, Settling in the Hearts:Jewish Fundamentalism in the Occupied Territories, Wayne State University Press, 2009 p.189. =Outposts= In 1997,Peace Now, Settlements and Outposts - Numbers and Data .

Haaretz, 10 January 2012 In 2006, Amona was evacuated, accompanied with violent clashes.Ynetnews, Violent clashes in Amona; hundreds hurt. Ynetnews, 1 February 2006 Eventually, the state refused to demolish the outpost. the case remains in dispute following the purchase by Jewish residents of five land plots from the Palestinian owners.\\"High Court of Justice rules 30 Amona outpost homes should be destroyed, but allows appeal\\". Jerusalem Post, 21 August 2013 In February 2017, The outpost of Amona was evacuated by order from the government of Israel. Economy Ofra's climate is suitable for growing cherries, nectarines, kiwifruit, grapes and olives. Other branches of agriculture include honey and poultry farming. In the nearby industrial area there are some small light-manufacturing workshops of carpentry and welding. In the verdict of the Supreme Court of Israel, the Ofra waste disposal plant, built with state funds, lies on Palestinian land. Prior to its construction, Ofra's sewage flowed into local rivers for three decades, polluting the Mountain Aquifer. The Palestinian landowners, through Yesh Din, have sought redress in Israel's Supreme Court. To legalize the plant, Israel would have to expropriate the Palestinians' property on which the treatment plant is built. But this measure would require that it service the waste disposal needs of the Palestinian villages nearby, which would exceed its capacity.Chaim Levinson Ofra waste treatment plant built on Palestinian land, at Haaretz, 2012. Various proposals have been raised to resolve the problem. The State is considering linking the villagers of Ein Yabrud to the plant, since they lack adequate waste treatment, but they decline the idea. Michael Sfard, a lawyer acting on their behalf, the state would have to reach an agreement to lease the land from the Palestinian villagers, negotiate a deal with the Palestinian-Israeli Joint Water Committee, and secure the requisite planning permits to legalise the situation. He regards such an outcome as improbable.Joanna Paraszczuk, Sharon Udasin, 'Ofra sewage plant can’t be used until land dispute solved,' at Jerusalem Post, 28 July 2011. Education Ulpana Ofra Today there are kindergartens, elementary schools, a girls high school (Ulpana Ofra, established in 1986), a midrasha (Midreshet Shuva) and a field school (a special school for biology environmental studies). The field school holds a permanent exhibition of the fauna of the area and of ancient agriculture. Ofra also has a bird watching center, located in a reservation near the Givat Tzvi neighborhood. Legal status =Status under international law= Like all Israeli settlements in the Israeli-occupied territories, Ofra is considered illegal under international law.Major Israeli settlement 'unlawful' BBC News. 22 December 2008 The international community considers Israeli settlements to violate the Fourth Geneva Convention's prohibition on the transfer of an occupying power's civilian population into occupied territory. The position of successive Israeli governments is that all authorized settlements are entirely legal and consistent with international law. The Israeli government disputes this on the basis of their position that the Palestinian territories are not occupied territory and as such does not accept that the Fourth Geneva Convention applies de jure, but has stated that on humanitarian issues it will govern itself de facto by its provisions, without specifying which these are.Gerson, Allan. Israel, the West Bank, and International law, Routledge, Sept 28, 1978, , p. 82.Roberts, Adam, \\"Decline of Illusions: The Status of the Israeli-Occupied Territories over 21 Years\\" in International Affairs (Royal Institute of International Affairs 1944–), Vol. 64, No. 3.

In June 2007, Haaretz reported that 179 of the 600 buildings in Ofra are considered illegal by the Israeli administration. Ofra is built on private Palestinian land. In a December 2008 report, B'Tselem has argued that while all Israeli settlements in the West Bank are illegal under international law, Ofra is illegal even under Israeli law stating that it violates three of the four established criteria for legality in the Sasson report. According to the report, while Ofra was authorized in 1979, it was never defined a jurisdictional area, never had an outline plan approved and no lawful building permits were issued. The report added that at least 58 percent of the settlement's built-up area is registered in the Land Registry Office under the names of Palestinians. Ofra residents claim the land was purchased legally from the Palestinians. They contended that the land was purchased legally but suggested that showing documents of the purchases would lead to Palestinian retribution attacks. Land deals are usually kept secret to protect Palestinian sellers.Amy Teibel, Lawsuit brings murky West Bank land deals to light. The Seattle Times, 20 June 2009. The Yesha Council accused B'Tselem of trying to remove Jews from their land saying the group \\"will spare no means - even lies\\" in order to harm the settlements. Homes were built on land bought with forged documents. Hundreds of structures in Ofra came under a demolition order from the Civil Administration after the villagers of Ein Yabrud laid a petition at the Israeli High Court of Justice over construction on their private land.Akiva Eldar, Israel's Ulpana neighborhood is built on years of land theft and forgery. Haaretz, 24 April 2012 A secret database, published by Haaretz in 2009, confirmed that Ofra was largely built on private Palestinian lands, without approval.Haaretz, Uri Blau, Secret Israeli database reveals full extent of illegal settlement. 1 January 2009. The published document (in Hebrew): . Part of it was translated in English by Yesh Din: “Spiegel Database” of West Bank settlements and outposts developed by the Israeli Ministry of Defense. In September 2011, the Israeli government set up plans to legitimise the settlement retroactively. Ofra's settlement fence was built without permits over wide swathes of land belonging to the Palestinian villages of Deir Dibwan and Silwad. The IDF has confirmed that permits were lacking, and undertook to rebuild the fence closer to Ofra within 2012. Top quality soil from this agricultural land is systematically 'stolen' for settlement use.Chaim Levinson 'West Bank settlers stealing tons of soil from Palestinian land,'. Haaretz, 10 October 2012. One house near the settlement, owned by the Palestinian Shehadeh family, who won a Jerusalem district court judgement in their favour, is still used as a yeshiva for Ofra's married men, and was expropriated by the IDF in favour of the settlers 10 days after the verdict was passed.Chaim Levinson,'IDF seized West Bank house despite court ruling for Palestinian owners,' Haaretz 9 December 2013. In the wake of a suit filed in 2008, on 9 February 2015, the Israeli Supreme Court ordered the demolition of 9 Ofra homes as standing on land with Palestinian title. The government was given two years to demolish the housing.'Israel's top court orders 9 settler homes razed,' Ma'an News Agency 9 February 2015.

It performs the music and dance of Bali in many different genres of Balinese gamelan, mainly gamelan gong kebyar, gamelan angklung, gender wayang, and gamelan jegog. Past performances have also featured ensembles playing in other styles as well, including gamelan joged bumbung, kecak, gender batel, gamelan gambuh, genggong, and beleganjur. GSJ has also performed contemporary pieces featuring instruments from the Western tradition. History Founded in 1979 by I Wayan Suweca, Rachel Ann Cooper and Michael Tenzer, Gamelan Sekar Jaya (GSJ) was the first community-based Balinese gamelan in the United States. Most of its performers are American volunteers, taught and led in performance by visiting Balinese master artists. Popular both in the States and abroad, the group has performed all over North America and has toured Bali seven times (1985, 1992, 1995, 2000, 2003, 2010, and 2014).

He is a martial artist created by writer Judd Winick and artist Phil Hester. He is a villain and enemy of Green Arrow, and he first appeared in Green Arrow vol. 3 #27 (2003). The character appeared in the first episode of the TV series Arrow in 2012. Fictional character biography =Childhood= Although his exact height has not been given, the Greek assassin Constantine Drakon is a short individual. As a child he was teased for this by other children. Once he started killing people at the age of ten, however, he found he was no longer sensitive about his stature. He claims that he had nothing strange or traumatic in his upbringing to turn him to murder, he was simply curious to see what he could do. Discovering that he was a prodigy at killing, Constantine proceeded to make a living out of it.Green Arrow 27 He considers what he does not just a job but a vocation, and takes pride in the businesslike manner in which he operates.Green Arrow 29 =Coming to Star City= When troll-like monsters began to terrorize the Elevast Corporation's construction sites (for a high-end retail center in a depressed area of Star City), the corporation hired Constantine Drakon. Drakon's job was to eliminate the monsters and cover up the link between them and the Elevast corporation. Oliver \\"Green Arrow\\" Queen's investigations into the monsters put him in direct confrontation with the European assassin. In their first encounter, Drakon soundly defeated Green Arrow, killing a friend of Connor Hawke (Oliver Queen's son) and crucifying Green Arrow with his own arrows, choosing not to kill the archer because he wasn't being paid enough to kill superheroes yet.Green Arrow 29 Why Drakon didn't kill Green Arrow. Drakon's next victim was attorney Joanna Pierce, niece of Black Lightning, who discovered information proving that an imperfect vaccine the Elevast Corporation produced had in fact turned human beings into the troll-like creatures. Joanna Pierce had recently met and become involved with Oliver Queen. Although they had broken up almost immediately after starting a relationship, her death would greatly disturb him for some time to come.Green Arrow 30 Drakon would subsequently invade the Green Arrow household looking for copies of Joanna Pierce's evidence and face Connor Hawke in battle. Connor was losing the battle badly when he received assistance from Mia Dearden (Speedy). Even then, he was only able to defeat Drakon by shooting through Mia's shoulder while Drakon was holding her hostage, and then blowing up the building with Drakon in it.Green Arrow 31 After that, Drakon did not appear until he was hired by Brick as part of a revenge scheme against Green Arrow. Drakon attacked Green Arrow's former sidekick Arsenal, cutting the young hero's throat and taking him prisoner.Green Arrow 39 Mia and Connor again squared off against Drakon, who again outclassed them in martial arts skill. But the two heroes outwitted him for a second time, this time luring him into a trap set by Shift of the Outsiders.Green Arrow: Moving Targets =One Year Later= When Deathstroke the Terminator was caught by Green Arrow (arguably on purpose), and went to prison to meet with Drakon. The two of them broke out of prison and confronted the Arrow Family. Despite being outnumbered four to one, Deathstroke comments that Team Arrow \\"should have brought more guys\\". The two of them are defeated and forced to escape when the Justice League arrives to rescue Team Arrow.Green Arrow 60 In other media Constantine Drakon appears in the television series Arrow, portrayed by Darren Shahlavi. In the pilot episode, Drakon is introduced as Adam Hunt's head of security.

The collarbones are typically either poorly developed or absent, which allows the shoulders to be brought close together. The front of the skull often does not close until later, and those affected are often shorter than average. Other symptoms may include a prominent forehead, wide set eyes, abnormal teeth, and a flat nose. Symptoms vary among people; however, intelligence is typically unaffected. The condition is either inherited from a person's parents or occurs as a new mutation. It is inherited in an autosomal dominant manner. It is due to a defect in the RUNX2 gene which is involved in bone formation. Diagnosis is suspected based on symptoms and X-rays with confirmation by genetic testing. Other conditions that can produce similar symptoms include mandibuloacral dysplasia, pyknodysostosis, osteogenesis imperfecta, and Hajdu-Cheney syndrome. Treatment includes supportive measures such as a device to protect the skull and dental care. Surgery may be performed to fix certain bone abnormalities. Life expectancy is generally normal. It affects about one per million people. Males and females are equally commonly affected. Modern descriptions of the condition date to at least 1896. The term is from cleido meaning collarbone, cranial from the Greek κρανιὀς meaning skull, and dysostosis meaning formation of abnormal bone. Signs and symptoms Mouth showing many over-retained deciduous teeth and some missing teeth. Cleidocranial dysostosis is a general skeletal condition so named from the collarbone (cleido-) and cranium deformities which people with it often have. People with the condition usually present with a painless swelling in the area of the clavicles at 2–3 years of age. Common features are: * Clavicles (collarbones) can be partly missing leaving only the medial part of the bone. In 10% of cases, they are completely missing. If the collarbones are completely missing or reduced to small vestiges, this allows hypermobility of the shoulders including ability to touch the shoulders together in front of the chest. The defect is bilateral 80% of the time. Partial collarbones may cause nerve damage symptoms and therefore have to be removed by surgery. * The mandible is prognathic due to hypoplasia of maxilla (micrognathism) and other facial bones. * A soft spot or larger soft area in the top of the head where the fontanelle failed to close, or the fontanelle closes late. * Bones and joints are underdeveloped. People are shorter and their frames are smaller than their siblings who do not have the condition. * The permanent teeth include supernumerary teeth. Unless these supernumeraries are removed they will crowd the adult teeth in what already may be an underdeveloped jaw. If so, the supernumeraries will probably need to be removed to make space for the adult teeth. Up to 13 supernumerary teeth have been observed. Teeth may also be displaced. Cementum formation may be deficient. * Failure of eruption of permanent teeth. * Bossing (bulging) of the forehead. * Open skull sutures, large fontanelles. * Hypertelorism. * Delayed ossification of bones forming symphysis pubis, producing a widened symphysis. * Coxa vara can occur, limiting abduction and causing Trendelenburg gait. * Short middle fifth phalanges, sometimes causing short and wide fingers. * Vertebral abnormalities. * On rare occasions, brachial plexus irritation can occur. * Scoliosis, spina bifida and syringomyelia have also been described. Other features are: parietal bossing, basilar invagination (atlantoaxial impaction), persistent metopic suture, abnormal ear structures with hearing loss, supernumerary ribs, hemivertebrae with spondylosis, small and high scapulae, hypoplasia of illiac bones, absence of the pubic bone, short / absent fibular bones, short / absent radial bones, hypoplastic terminal phalanges. Genetics It is usually autosomal dominant, but in some cases the cause is not known. It occurs due to haploinsufficiency caused by mutations in the CBFA1 gene (also called Runx2), located on the short arm of chromosome 6, which encodes transcription factor required for osteoblast differentiation. It results in delayed ossification of midline structures of the body, particularly membranous bone. A new article reports that the CCD cause is thought to be due to a CBFA1 (core binding factor activity 1) gene defect on the short arm of chromosome 6p21 . CBFA1 is vital for differentiation of stem cells into osteoblasts, so any defect in this gene will cause defects in membranous and endochondral bone formation.Saraswathivilasam S. Suresh, A Family With Cleidocranial Dysplasia And Crossed Ectopic Kidney In One Child, Acta Orthop. Belg. 2009, N° 4 (Vol. 75/4) p.521-527. Diagnosis Different features of the dysostosis are significant. Radiological imaging helps confirm the diagnosis. During gestation (pregnancy), clavicular size can be calculated using available nomograms. Wormian bones can sometimes be observed in the skull. Diagnosis of CCD spectrum disorder is established in an individual with typical clinical and radiographic findings and/or by the identification of a heterozygous pathogenic variant in RUNX2 (CBFA1). Treatment Around 5 years of age, surgical correction may be necessary to prevent any worsening of the deformity. If the mother has dysplasia, caesarian delivery may be necessary. Craniofacial surgery may be necessary to correct skull defects. Coxa vara is treated by corrective femoral osteotomies. If there is brachial plexus irritation with pain and numbness, excision of the clavicular fragments can be performed to decompress it. In case of open fontanelle, appropriate headgear may be advised by the orthopedist for protection from injury.  Prognosis  Several studies have reported that life expectancy appears to be normal for people with CCD. Epidemiology Cleidocranial dysostosis affects about one per million people. Notable cases In 1987, a young girl named Jessica McClure fell down a narrow well pipe in her family's Texas property. Ron Short, a roofing contractor who was born without collarbones because of cleidocranial dysostosis and thus could collapse his shoulders to work in cramped corners, arrived at the site and offered to go down the shaft. The rescuers did not end up using him, though McClure was successfully recovered from the well. Child actor Gaten Matarazzo was born with cleidocranial dysplasia, which is incorporated into his character Dustin Henderson's storyline on Stranger Things. Sibling actress-singers Abigail and Milly Shapiro were born with cleidocranial dysplasia, a trait they share with their mother.

AGIL uses a reaction of chlorine atoms with gaseous hydrazoic acid, resulting in excited molecules of chloronitrene (), which then pass their energy to the iodine atoms much like the singlet oxygen does in COIL. The iodine atoms then emit the laser radiation itself. AGIL has numerous advantages over COIL. The chemicals are all in gaseous phase, therefore easier to work with than liquids, especially in microgravity conditions.

It was founded in 1970 and is organized in 8 Faculties. The University of Augsburg is a relatively young campus university with approx. 18,000 students in October 2012. About 14% of its students come from foreign countries, a larger percentage than at comparable German universities. In October 2011 Sabine Doering Manteuffel succeeded Alois Loidl as rector of the university. She is the first female rector of a Bavarian university. Organisation Scene from the main campus of the University of Augsburg The university is divided into 8 faculties: * Faculty of Economics and Business (founded 1970) * Faculty of Law (founded 1971) * Faculty of Catholic Theology (founded 1971) * Faculty of Philosophy and Social Sciences (founded 1972) * Faculty of History and Philology (founded 1972) * Faculty of Mathematics and Natural Sciences (founded 1981) * Faculty of Applied Computer Science (founded 2003) * Faculty of Medicine (founded 2016, in development) Campus The individual faculties, the administration offices (including the Student Service Centre), the refectory, cafeterias, bars, and the libraries are all close together. History The University of Augsburg was founded in 1970. It is one of the new, modern universities in Bavaria, and with approximately 18,000 (October 2012) students it is still of a manageable size. It attracts students from far beyond its immediate catchment area. About 20% of the German students come from outside Bavaria, and at 14% its share of foreign students is larger than at comparable universities. The University of Augsburg maintains partnerships with the Universities of Pittsburgh (USA), Osijek (Croatia) and Iaşi (Romania), and the Far Eastern State University of Humanities, which is in Khabarovsk (Russia). It has cooperation agreements with over forty universities in Europe, Asia, South Africa, North America and Latin America. The number of ERASMUS exchange programmes also continues to grow. There are currently exchange programmes with more than 130 universities throughout Europe. Anyone who has studied or carried out research here can keep in touch with the University of Augsburg once they have returned home. “Alumni Augsburg International” is a network for Augsburg students, too, as they can use it to find contacts. University library Augsburg University library consists of the central library plus libraries for social sciences, humanities and natural sciences. It was founded along with the university in 1969 and was at first situated in the ducal residence (Fronhof). In 1970, it was moved to the campus of the old university at Memminger Straße. The new central library on the current campus south of Augsburg opened in 1984.Rudolf Frankenberger: Die Universitätsbibliothek Augsburg Augsburg 1970-1985. In: Bibliotheksforum Bayern 13 (1985), 6-22 The library comprises a total of some 2.0 million items (as of 2007). Professional language teaching The University of Augsburg's Language Centre provides tuition in modern languages. Students of philology receive practical language training in English, French, Spanish, Italian and Portuguese. In addition to this, the Language Centre offers courses specifically tailored to law and economics students, as well as the opportunity to study other languages such as Russian, Turkish or Japanese. Foreign students can improve their German language skills in tandem with their other studies. The University of Augsburg and the University of Applied Sciences work closely together in a joint testing centre for German as a Foreign Language (“TestDaF-Zentrum”), which tests the German language skills of international students. Partnerships The University of Augsburg has cooperation agreements with over 40 universities in Europe, Asia, South Africa, North America and Latin America.

Several brands of wine from Ukraine are exported to bordering countries, the European Union, and North America. History Massandra winery A wine culture existed in today's Ukraine already in the 4th century BC at the south coast of the Crimea. Presses and amphoras were found from this period. Wine cultivation in the northern part of the country (around Kyiv and Chernihiv) however only started in the 11th century by monks. Under Catherine II (1729–1796) in 1783 the Crimea became a part of the Russian Empire. Count Mikhail Vorontsov planted the first wine gardens in 1820 and established a large winery near Yalta. The viticulture research institute Magarach was founded then in 1828. In 1822, with the approval of Tsar Alexander I, Swiss winegrowers from the canton Vaud established a colony at Shabo (French: Chabag). They later founded daughter colonies on the Dnieper and in Crimea. Wine from Chabag was displayed at the 1893 World's Columbian Exposition in Chicago and received a medal of recognition. The founder of the famous sparkling wines is prince Lev Golitsyn, who for the first time manufactured Russian “Champagner” after the Crimean War (1854 to 1856) on his property Novyi Svet near Yalta. Later, under the last Tzar Nicholas II (1868–1918) the predecessor of Massandra, today's state winery, was founded. During Soviet times Ukraine with was the largest supplier of the wines in the USSR. It came to a disaster in 1986: about of the vineyards were destroyed, when Soviet premier Mikhail Gorbachev started a campaign against the over consumption of alcohol in USSR. Since 2000 the production as well as the export of the wines increased rapidly.

Generally speaking, once a security interest is effectively created, it gives certain rights to the holder of the security and imposes duties on the party who grants that security.Mace Builders v Lunn [1987] Ch 191 However, in many legal systems, additional steps --- perfection of the security interest --- are required to enforce the security against third parties such as a liquidator.For example, section 395 of the Companies Act 1986 of the United Kingdom requires certain security interests to be filed at Companies House within 21 days of being created. A failure to make such a filing does not affect the validity of the security interest between the debtor and the secured party, but if the debtor goes into insolvent liquidation, the security interest is void against the liquidator. Concept As a legal concept, perfection must be distinguished from: *the grant or creation of the security interest, which creates its primary validity; *attachment, which are steps that link the security interest to the underlying asset; and, *priority, which is an ordering of competing security interests in same asset. The same rule --- the common law rule in Dearle v Hall, for instance --- may govern both perfection against third parties (e.g., subsequent security holders) and prioritization of competing security interests. In most legal systems, the need for perfection arises only in relation to security interests that are proprietary in nature (such as a mortgage or equitable charge). Other arrangements which constitute security in the loose sense of the word --- for instance, title retention arrangements, hire purchase, and leasing transactions --- need not in general be perfected in the legal sense. In India, Section 125 of the Companies Act, 1956 provides that certain charges shall be void against liquidator or creditors unless registered. Thus, if a charge is not registered with Registrar of Companies, and company happens to go for liquidation, even secured creditor shall be treated as unsecured. Types of perfection There are three principal modes by which a security interest may be perfected (which method of perfection is applicable depends upon the nature of the security interest and the laws of the relevant country). # possession of the collateral; # statutory registration or filing;Such as the filing under section 395 of the United Kingdom Companies Act 1986 referred to above and # notice to the debtor or a fundholder. =Possession= Some security interests can be perfected only by the actual possession of the asset. For example, under a common-law pledge (or pawn), the right to enforce the sale of the asset is contingent upon the possession of that asset: an agreement that leaves the debtor in possession of the pledged collateral does not give rise to an enforceable security interest.Dublin City Distilery Co Ltd v Doherty [1914] AC 823 In certain cases, the possession does not need to be actual possession, but may be constructive possession. For example, possession of a document of title will often suffice where it is not possible to possess the goods.Although see Official Assignee of Madras v Mercantile Bank of India [1935] AC 53 where Lord Wright inferred that this may not be the case, discussed and explained in other terms in Commercial Law by Roy Goode. In many legal systems, there may also be constructive possession by attornment. The law relating to perfection of security interests by taking of possession can sometimes be confused with the law relating to the granting of security interests, which provides that the deposit of certain assets (usually documents of title) can amount to an equitable mortgage of the goods.For a recent example an equitable mortgage created this way in Australia, see . =Registration or filing= Certain security interests may be perfected by some kind of registration or filing. Although the terms are used interchangeably, it is more accurate to speak of registration as the lodgment of particulars, and filing as the lodgment of the security instrument itself.Report of the Committee on Consumer Credit (Cmnd. 4596, 1971), para 5.7.13; the distinction does have some meaning, as registration of particulars only makes third parties aware that there is a security interest, whereas filing they can see the terms of the security interest. Generally systems of registration divide into two types: # registration against a particular debtor; and # registration against a particular asset. Each has its own advantages and disadvantages. Registration against a particular asset only tends to be practical where the assets are of a nature and substance that makes it feasible to have a register for recording security interests against them. Most countries have systems for the registration of security relating to land, aircraft, ships and intellectual property rights. The advantage of a register relating to the asset is that if the debtor wishes to provide an asset as collateral, the proposed lender can swiftly check definitively whether the asset is encumbered or not. Issues arise when a secured creditor does not file with the correct office, leaving potential lenders without notice of encumbrances on potential collateral. One particular note regarding the perfection of security interests in a patent is an illustration of this issue of miscommunication. In order to perfect a security interest in a patent, it is not enough that you file a patent with the Patent and Trademark Office. A secured creditor, in order to perfect its interest, must file in the UCC Filing system. This is because the Patent act does not \\"preempt\\" the state requirements for filing. In other contexts, filing outside of the UCC filing system is appropriate to perfect a security interest. Specialist registers in some jurisdictions cannot always be considered \\"a one-stop source of information\\".For an analysis of the uncertainties surrounding Intellectual property registers in the UK see Andrea Tosato, Security interests over intellectual property (2011) Journal of intellectual property law and Practice 99 Registration against a debtor tends to operate by way of requiring the registration of certain security interests by the debtor. The advantage is that a lender can quickly see which assets of the debtor are encumbered and which are not. However, because many registration systems do not require all types of security interest to be registered gaps can remain. Also, systems which register security against the debtor do not act as a check that the debtor actually has title to any of the relevant assets, merely that he has not created any security interest over them.A lender can still be in difficulty if it transpires that the goods are subject to a lease, or retention of title arrangement, or other form of non-registrable arrangement. However, the position is complicated by the fact that many legal systems employ both, interchangeably. A security interest granted by a debtor over a particular asset in any given country may need to be registered against the debtor, against the asset, both or neither.For example, in the United Kingdom if a company was to grant a mortgage over land and its rental income, this would be registrable both against the company (under section 395 of the Companies Act) and the asset (under the Land Registration Act and/or the Land Charges Act), but the same company granting a fixed equitable charge over a car would not be required to register it anywhere. =Notice = In some legal systems, perfection of a security interest requires notice to be given to a relevant third party. This most commonly arises in relation to security over a debt or other chose in action, notice being required to be given to the party owing the debt or holding the fund. Under English law, an often cited example is the well-known rule in Dearle v Hall. Under the rule if A is owed money by X, and then A grants an equitable charge over that debt to B, and then grants a second equitable charge over the same debt to C, then the ability to enforce the charge by either B or C against the money in X's hands is dependent upon the giving of notice to X. The controversy in the rule relates to the fact that it is also a rule of priority, meaning that (if their rights are otherwise equal) the first one to give notice to X has the prior claim, irrespective of the order in which the equitable charges were granted. Similarly, in many common law legal systems, where there is an assignment of a debt, the assignee cannot enforce the rights of the assigning creditor against the debtor unless notice of the assignment has been given, and until notice of the assignment has been given, the debtor can still discharge the debt by paying the money to the creditor, notwithstanding the assignment.

Mehmet Arif Şenerim was born in Boyabat in 1877, of the Çiloğullari family. His father was Çiloğlu İlyas and mother was Sara (Sahure). After completing his primary education in the Eyüp Military Primary School (1887–1891), in 1891 he enrolled with the Istanbul Soğuksu Military Junior High (1891–1894), then Kuleli Military High School in Istanbul. After graduating from Kuleli, he was admitted in 1894 to the Ottoman Military Academy in Istanbul, and graduated from this distinguished institution as a young infantry second lieutenant in on 5 January 1899. After his graduation, he was stationed in Merzifon with the Fourth Army 75th Reg. 4th Batt. 1st Comp. In 1907 he was promoted to the rank of first lieutenant and was posted with the Alaşehir Reg. 2nd Batt. 4th Comp., then with the 72nd Reg. 3rd Batt.2nd Comp. which was stationed in Pirepol, Bulgaria. On 1 March 1910, he was promoted to the rank of captain and was posted with 66th Reg. 2nd Batt. 7th Comp. In 1911, he was stationed with 42nd Reg. 2nd Batt. 7th Comp. First Balkan War At the outset of the First Balkan War, he was sent to the Greek front in Macedonia. He was the commander of 7th Company with 42nd Reg. 2nd Batt. in the Battles of Kiresne Yenicesi when he was taken as a prisoner of war by the Greeks in 1912. After being held captive for nine months in the town of Amolyas in the north of Thessaloniki, he escaped to join the 2nd Corps 13th Reg. 1st Batt. 1st Comp. as the commander of the company in , near Kırklareli. First World War At the outset of the First World War, he was sent to the Gallipoli front to join the 5th Army under Marshall Otto Liman von Sanders. He was first stationed with 5th Division 15th Reg. 3rd. Batt. in Kadiköy, near Gallipoli in April 1915. He was the commander of the 9th Company of the 3rd. Batt. 15th Reg., together with 13th and 14th Reg., was ordered to reach Ariburnu front until 1 May and serve under Lt. Colonel Mustafa Kemal's 19th Division. On March 18, 1915, when the English and French navies in an attempt to force their way up the Çanakkale Strait gave heavy losses, they decided to put units on land at Gallipoli Peninsula. The ANZAC forces which landed at Arıburnu on 25 April 1915 were stopped by the 19th Division under Mustafa Kemal's command at Conkbayırı. On 1 May 1915, the Kabatepe Battle (the 3rd Aribunu Battle) took place. Assault was ordered on ANZAC Corps under General Birdwood (and was formed with 1st Australian Division, 2nd Australian and New Zealand Division, Ceylon Battalion and Indian Battalion) at 5:00 a.m. Captain Mehmet Arif was with 15th Reg. that attacked from Merkeztepe and that formed the Center Arm. He was tasked to fortify the trenches and it was completed under the heavy fire of the ANZAC Corps. Another assault was ordered for the regiments in the center at 2:00 a.m. on 2 May 1915. The losses of 15th Regt that day and night were heavy: 12 officers and 920 privates. The commander of the 3rd Battalion died and Captain Mehmed Arif took command of the battalion. On the assault on 19 May 1915 he served under 5th Division of Hasan Basri. Without any gains, assaults turned into trench wars and continued on. Mehmet Arif served under 16th and 12th Divisions of Rüştü Bey, Abdülrezzak Bey and Refet Bey. He was wounded in the groin and taken to Moda hospital in İstanbul. He was discharged two and a half months later and joined his battalion. He was on the Left Arm with his 3rd Battalion during the Arıburnu Battles. He was honoured with the Silver War Medal and Merit Medal by Colonel Abdülrezzak Bey, Commander of the Ariburnu Front. Until the end of August 1915 he served in the trench wars on the Arıburnu front at Gallipoli. In 1915 he was promoted to the rank of \\"Kolağası\\" (senior major) and was posted with the 14th Regt, which was stationed in Bitlis on the Eastern Front. In the assaults for recapturing the city from the Russian and Armenian armies, he assaulted on 1 March 1916 from the center and seized the locations of the Russians, liberating the city of Bitlis. Due to this heavy assault, Russian forces and their rearguards could not cling onto Bitlis, and withdrew to Kirkor mountains. Russians re-attacked with fresh forces from the right side of the battalion and the battalion withdrew to its initial location. He renewed the resistance from here until the Truce with Russia. On 1 Dec 1916 he was promoted to the rank of Major and delegated to the command of the 14th Regiment. He campaigned against the Armenian Army and surprised by attacking from the left side at the Peroz Battle. This prevented Armenians from capturing Ahlat and Karmuş. The Battles of Erciş, Adilcevaz, Pehmas and Rumya took place as guerilla wars. As Armenians captured many locations with small forces, there was no hinterland specified for any forces, so the regiments were mainly located together. At the Eastern Front (Bitlis Front) he served under Refet Bey, Alaettin Bey, Ali Fuat Bey, Sıtkı Bey, Mustafa Bey, again Sıtkı Bey and finally Kenan Bey. At the Truce, 30 Oct 1918, he was honoured with the Merit Medal by Brigadier General Ali İhsan Pahsa. When the First World War ended, he was a prisoner of war. On his release he delegated to the command of the 24th Regiment which was stationed in Nusaybin on 1 June 1919, then he delegated to the command of the 14th Regiment which was stationed in Mardin on 1 December 1919. He intervened in the Rebellion of Nusaybin Ali Batı and Midyat to keep order. Turkish War of Independence During the Turkish War of Independence, he served on the western front. He joined the Battles of Eskişehir, Karköy, Razancı, Mudanya and Bandırma with the Porsuk Platoon against the Greek armies. Turkish armies were victorious and the towns in the western Anatolia were liberated one by one. After the victory, he was honoured with Testimonial in 1923 when he was a major, and the same year he was promoted to the rank of lieutenant colonel. In 1925 he was honoured with the Medal of Independence. He built the first Army Guesthouse (Orduevi) in Konya. He retired in 1930 and settled in Konya. He married twice. His first wife was Ayşe Hanım, who was the mother of Colonel Behzat Balkış, Pertev Çandar and Muzeyyen Hanim. Ayşe Hanım died in Nevrekop at age 30. His second wife was Zehra Hanım of Nevrokop, who is the mother of teacher Nergis Şenerim. Elder son of Mehmet Arif Şenerim, Colonel Behzat Balkış and his wife Mihriban Balkış had two sons—Orhan Balkış, who was a judge, died at the age of 44 and Alev Balkış. Orhan Balkış had two daughters named Nurdan Balkış and Melda Balkış Güner. Mehmet Arif Şenerim's second son Pertev Çandar had two sons named Güchan and Sühan Çandar.

Early life Born the son of a builder, Barnet was educated at the local high school. In 1843, at the age of sixteen, Barnet moved to London, where he became a builder's apprentice, studying drawing under William Dyce RA and architecture with CJ Richardson FRIBA. He then became of clerk of works with the Worshipful Company of Fishmongers. In 1854 he married and sailed for Sydney, Australia, with his new wife, Rosa. In Sydney, he worked first as a builder for Edmund Blacket, then became Clerk of Works at the University of Sydney. Colonial architect In 1860, he joined the Colonial Architect's Office. In 1862, he was acting head of the office; in 1865, he was promoted to the post of Colonial Architect. He held that position for twenty-five years until the Office was reorganised in 1890. In that period the department built 169 post and telegraph offices, 130 courthouses, 155 police stations, 110 lock-ups, 20 lighthouses and many other types of buildings. His major works include the General Post Office building in Sydney, Callan Park Lunatic Asylum, the Australian Museum, the Colonial Secretary's building, Lands Department building, and the Anderson Stuart Building at Sydney University. = Major projects = Some major works completed by Barnet include: *Defence works at Botany Bay, Port Jackson and Newcastle *Court houses, lock-ups, police stations and post offices throughout New South Wales (see Court houses in New South Wales) *Lighthouses, including rebuilding the Macquarie Lighthouse first built by Francis Greenway, Smoky Cape Lighthouse at South West Rocks, Sugarloaf Point Light Station at Seal Rocks, Barranjoey Head at Palm Beach, Green Cape at Eden and the similarly designed five lighthouses, Richmond River Light, Clarence River Light, Tacking Point Lighthouse, Crowdy Head Light and Fingal Head Light, built in 1878-1880. = Major Sydney public buildings = Major public buildings in Sydney by Barnet include: The Mortuary Station in Rookwood Cemetery circa\\"' 1865 * Australian Museum (new wing) * Colonial Secretary's Building * Callan Park Lunatic Asylum * Customs House * Darlinghurst Court House * Department of Lands building * East Sydney Technical College * General Post Office * Medical School Anderson Stuart building at the University of Sydney * Mortuary Station, Central Railway * North Sydney Post Office (opened 1889 as St Leonards PO, renamed 1890Sydney Architecture Images- North Sydney Post Office at www.sydneyarchitecture.com) * Parramatta Post Office * Public Works Building * State Library of New South Wales * Traffic Court No. 2, Sydney * Victoria Lodge, Botanical Gardens The Colonial Architect's office was also responsible for maintenance of public buildings. Between 1865 and 1881, Barnet had supervised 1,490 projects. Other roles were assigned to Barnet: for example, he was put in charge of the arrangements for the visit of the Duke of Edinburgh in 1868. Sydney International Exhibition building Architectural drawing of the Garden Palace, Sydney, Southern elevation In 1879, Barnet was put in charge of the design and erection of the Sydney International Exhibition building. The Colonial Architect's Office completed this large task in nine months, including preparing 412 drawings, management of the accounts and payments associated with the project, and supervision of the building. Night shifts were used to get through the project using the first electric light in Sydney. Although the project was judged a success at the end, Barnet was constantly criticised in Parliament during the construction. The project overran its budget of £50,000 by more than three times, costing £184,570. Barnet had previously been criticised in 1874 over the new wing of the Australian Museum by the Museum's trustees and a select committee of the Legislative Assembly. By contrast, also in 1874, the first stage of his General Post Office in Martin Place received high praise, putting aside the much criticised carved figures in the arcade. = Defence buildings = Between 1870 and 1889 Barnet was on the commission set up to plan the colony's defence. Barnet built new batteries and barracks. In July 1889, defence works became the responsibility of a military works branch of the Public Works Department. The new director was Lieutenant–Colonel F.R. de Wolski. De Wolski criticised Barnet's work. Barnet was not prompt in handing over plans and documents for defence works. There had been rumours about the project at Bare Island battery in Botany Bay. On 1 July 1890, a Royal Commission was set up to investigate the letting of contracts and report on the work completed. The evidence presented by staff of the Colonial Architect's office and Barnet was contradictory. The Commission found that the work was below standard and the Colonial Architect's supervision of the project was not adequate. While the minister supported Barnet, the Commission's censure was a regrettable end to his distinguished career. Barnet resigned as Colonial Architect. He believed that de Wolski had significantly influenced the Commission and held that the Commission’s findings were unjust, petty and spiteful.  Architectural approach and Legacy  Barnet's work drew from a variety classical sources, sometimes with elements from specific buildings, with levels of elaboration or features that suited the function. For instance his courthouses often included a bold Neoclassical portico, while his post offices often featured a rustic Italianate clocktower, and both types of buildings often featured generous verandahs or arcaded loggias, shaded areas that suited the hot colonial climate. His larger works like the Sydney departmental buildings, the GPO, and the Garden Palace synthesised elements from various periods of the Italian Renaissance, as well as from English architects such as Christopher Wren and Charles Robert Cockerell, to create impressive compositions. When suitable he could also design in a lively Gothic Revival style, notably the two cemetery railway stations. Some later designs drew directly from the later Renaissance, from what we now call Mannerism and Baroque, notably Bathurst Goal, the Central Police Court and the Rocks Police Station. After his retirement in 1899 he published a short overview of architecture in his adopted colony, entitled Architectural work in Sydney, New South Wales, 1788-1899. He had little time for the new styles of architecture becoming fashionable in Sydney at the end of the nineteenth century, particularly those that followed American trends.

The population was measured at 768 in 317 households at the 2011 census. At one time the village was an important commercial centre for the surrounding agricultural communities, but it is now largely a dormitory, although a number of farming families remain with a much reduced workforce. History May Day celebrations, banned under the Commonwealth, were revived in 1660. The maypole at Castle Bytham was inscribed to commemorate the date when it was later cut in half for use as a ladder in the church tower The name 'Bytham' is first recorded in 1067 (as a monastery that rapidly translated to Vaudey Abbey), and comes from the Old English word bythme meaning Valley bottom, broad valley. In the Domesday survey of 1086 the village was known as West BythamWild, John, (1871); The History of Castle Bytham: Its Ancient Fortress and Manor p. 3; BiblioBazaar (2008) / Nabu Press (2010) as the castle had yet to be built. People have named the river that runs through the village the Tham or Am as a back-formation from the village name.

In the early hours of 19 November 1942 Handley Page Halifax BB209 NP-G1942 Handley-Page Halifax crash of 158 Sqn, from RAF Rufforth in North Yorkshire, crashed near Stocken Hall Farm (in the wood). It had been hit by flak south-east of Paris coming back from a raid on Turin, Italy.Lost Bombers Half the aircrew were in the RCAF. =Castle= Overlooking the village is an 11th-century Norman castle mound. The site of the castle in Saxon times was owned by Morcar, also known as Morkere, who was the brother of Ealdgyth, wife of King Harold. The castle, which gave its name to the village, was built soon after the Norman conquest and was given by the Conqueror to his half brother Odo, Bishop of Bayeux and Earl of Kent;Cox, J. Charles (1916); Lincolnshire, Methuen & Co. Ltd., p.96 it was later owned by William le Gros, 1st Earl of Albemarle, and was burnt in the 15th century during the Wars of the Roses. In 1221, after a siege, the castle was destroyed by Henry III with the help of Hugh de Mortimer and William de Warenne, 5th Earl of Surrey. It had been defended by William de Forz, 3rd Earl of Albemarle aided by William d'Aubigny, Sir Richard Siward, Henry de Hastings and William de Hastings. In the 16th century John Leland described remnants of the castle: \\"yet remained great walls of buildings\\". Geography Village sign in Castle Bytham The nearest town is Stamford (even though Castle Bytham is in the Grantham postal area, with a Nottingham postcode). It is at the apex of the NG (Grantham), LE (Rutland) and PE (Stamford) postcodes. The village is very close to the Rutland boundary. The civil parish extends much to the north-west of the village, up to Woolley's Lane, including Red Barn Quarry, owned by Bullimores. It also extends westwards to include all of Morkery Wood (originally named Morkerhaw - named after the Saxon earl Morcar mentioned above). South of the A1 interchange to Woolley's Lane, the parish boundary is with North Witham, including Park House Farm. The eastern buildings of Stocken Hall Farm lie in the parish (with an LE15 postcode), with the rest in Stretton. To the east, Little Haw Wood is also in the parish. Southwards, the civil parish extends to (and includes) Pillowsyke Holt, a piece of woodland near Holywell. Eastwards, the parish extends for about half a mile, where it includes the 30 acre Lawn Wood which has been a nature reserve since 1995, joining two neighbouring meadows that were donated to Lincolnshire Wildlife Trust in 1993. The meadows are a good site for buttercups and yellow rattle, and are managed to encourage butterflies, including the ringlet, and the meadow brown. The wood is mainly oak and ash, but includes field maple, midland hawthorn and the uncommon wild service tree; woodland flora such as wood anemone, woodruff and early purple orchid also found there. Fallow deer and red deer are frequently seen in the reserve. =Surrounding area= About to the east lies Little Bytham. The two villages used to be called West and East Bytham. To the west, on the western side of the A1 road, is South Witham near the source of the River Witham. The village's vicar, and that of the Bythams Group, is also the wife of the vicar of South Witham. Between the village and the A1 the Lincolnshire Wildlife Trust maintains an important wildlife reserve at Tortoiseshell Wood (which borders on to the west of the civil parish) and some of the road verges are protected for wildlife by Lincolnshire County Council. Tortoiseshell Wood is in the parish of North Witham, although the edge lies on the parish boundary. West of the village, towards Clipsham, is a Yew Tree Avenue maintained by the Forestry Commission, the trees cut into large topiary forms.

The incumbent is Revd S M Evans. community web site Castle Bytham's community supports several events each year in the village hall. Every year Castle Bytham holds a midsummer fair and street market, with stalls, a duck grand prix, dog show, funfair, children's games, beer tents and barbecues. The fair has raised over £40,000 for local causes including a Christmas lunch for pensioners and a children's party, and village infrastructure improvements. Efforts are currently being made to improve the village recreation ground for the benefit of local young people and a 2010 Parish Plan suggested wider improvements. The former RAF Coningsby station commander (1974-60) and Commandant of the Central Flying School (1979–83) lives in the village, and a former resident on Glen Road was Harold Wilson's press secretary, Sir Trevor Lloyd-Hughes.Stamford MercurySir Trevor Lloyd- Hughes There is a village shop on Pinfold Road. Castle Bytham Post OfficeCastle Bytham Post Office geograph.org.uk was closed in 2008 despite local opposition. It had served Creeton, Swinstead, Swayfield, Little Bytham and Clipsham, and other nearby small villages – it has now been replaced by a mobile 'outreach' service. There are two remaining public houses in the village: the Fox & Hounds and the Castle Inn. The New Inn on Station Road was converted to housing in the 1960s. =Former railway station= The village had a railway station on the Midland and Great Northern Joint Railway, the remains of which can still be seen. This railway station was rather unusual, being a single platform in a deep cutting through the village. The railway station was not originally planned by the railway, but was added after considerable local lobbying. It remained open, as did the goods yard on the other side of the road, until the line closed in 1959. West of the village the line of the railway now forms a road crossing under the A1. =Places of worship= The church, started in the 12th century, and restored in 1900, is dedicated to St James and is one of a group of parishes in the rural deanery of Beltisloe. It contains an unusual memento of the English Restoration: a ladder, formerly used in the tower, with a carved inscription which reads \\"THIS WARE THE MAY POVL 1660\\" (see photograph), suggesting that May celebrations were held in the village (as they were throughout the country) to mark the return to the throne of King Charles II. There was at one time a Methodist chapel in High Street (now a private house), served by visiting ministers from Stamford. On its closure in 1972 the Methodist Circuit still sent a preacher to the village for a few years, service taking place in the parish church.

History =Early years= HMM-265 was commissioned on October 1, 1962 at Marine Corps Air Facility Jacksonville, North Carolina. Originally flying the UH-34, the squadron deployed to Memphis, Tennessee shortly after commissioning in support of the Mississippi Crisis, a critical moment in the American civil rights movement. Following that, HMM-265 began a series of deployments testing new helicopter tactics such as the night raid. The squadron's commanding officer, LtCol Beeler, developed innovative new helicopter tactics and became a legacy in the \\"Dragons\\" and in helicopter aviation.

In addition to daily missions transporting Marines and cargo, HMM-265 and its Sea Knights flew in support of Operation Macon from July 4 through October 27, 1966. HMM-265 along with HMM-164 conducted multiple battalion insertions to allow the 3rd Marine Division to conduct multiple search and destroy missions in the An Hoa region. 12th Marines artillery and Marine A-4 Skyhawks fired on landing zones prior to the CH-46s landing. The other major operation in 1966 was Operation Prairie (August 3 – September 13). The Dragons supported the 4th Marine Regiment as they battled for the Nui Cay Tre (Mutter's) Ridge. Landing in “hot” zones under heavy enemy fire marked this battle, a harbinger of future battles in Vietnam.

As the SLF squadron, the Dragons were tasked with conducting heliborne search and destroy missions against Viet Cong targets along the coast. During this time, five major operations were conducted with names such as Bear Chain/Fremont, Beacon Guide, Kangaroo Kick, Beacon Gate, and Cochise. The Dragons resumed duties as the SLF squadron aboard in May 1969. They conducted amphibious raids in support of Operations Bold Pursuit (June 27 – July 6), Mighty Play (July 10 – July 20), and finally Defiant Stand (September 7 – September 18). After three years in Vietnam, the squadron was relocated to Marine Corps Air Station Santa Ana, California on October 10, 1969 leaving their helicopters with other in-country squadrons. A total of twenty-seven HMM-265 Marines perished in the war. HMM-265 was rebuilt using a few squadron personnel returned from Vietnam and the Marines of HMMT-301. The CH-46A helicopters left behind in Vietnam were replaced by the CH-46 Super D from overhaul. The squadron was deactivated on November 13, 1970. =Reactivation in 1977= On September 1, 1977, HMM-265 was reactivated at Marine Corps Air Station Kaneohe Bay, Hawaii under the command of Lieutenant Colonel Donald Klingler, reestablishing a presence in the Pacific that continues to this day. On the day of reactivation, the squadron had no helicopters, and by December it was almost at a full strength of 4 CH-46Ds and 7 CH-46Fs. In the spring of 1978, HMM-265 deployed to Kauai's Barking Sands training area to increase combat readiness in preparation for their upcoming Western Pacific deployment. While there, the squadron performed exercises in low terrain flying and troop transportation. In April 1978, HMM-265 embarked onto and departed for the Western Pacific in order to establish first-line-of-defense military presence during the Cold War era. The squadron was away from Kaneohe Marine Corps Air Station for six months, during which they completed a training exercises In Cebu, Philippines with additional port calls in Hong Kong and Singapore. The deployment strength for this mission was 12 CH-46s, 4 CH-53s, 2 UH-1Ns, and 2 AH-1Js. After spending a year at home, HMM-265 began preparing for their next deployment by accomplishing a training exercise on the island of Kahoolawe. They spent the first weekend of August 1979 on the island conducting amphibious operations with the Battalion Landing Team, combining the AV-8A Harrier and helicopter operations and conducting exercises on board . In late August 1979, HMM-265 deployed again to the Western Pacific, this time on USS Tripoli, to maintain military presence during the Cold War. Once again under the command of Lt. Col. Donald Klingler, the squadron deployed with the Marine Amphibious Unit (MAU) to combine with several additional MAUs to participate in Operation Fortress Gale in Okinawa. Following that, they participated in an assignment called Kangaroo Three in Northeastern Australia, a joint operation between the squadron, the New Zealand military, and the Australian military forces. They also visited New Guinea, Hong Kong, Tasmania, and Sydney where they celebrated the Marine Corps birthday on November 10, 1979. The deployment strength during this assignment was 12 CH-46s, 4 CH-53s, 2 UH-1Ns, 2 AH-1Js, 2 AV-8As. After the squadron returned home in early February 1980, the reins of the squadron were passed to Lt. Col. William Barba during a Change of Command ceremony on February 22. Under the leadership of Barba, the squadron continued to operate in and out of Kaneohe Bay and the Western Pacific. Under Barba, HMM-265 (REIN) \\"Dragons\\" deployed aboard as part of Task Group 76.3/Amphibious Ready Group Alfa/Amphibious Squadron Seven. HMM-265 was equipped with 12 CH-46D Sea Knight and were reinforced by detachments from HMH-463 \\"Pegasus\\" and 4 CH-53D Sea Stallions, HMA-169 \\"Vipers\\" with 4 AH-1T Sea Cobra / 2 UH-1N Hueys from MCAS Camp Pendleton, California, and VMA-513 \\"Flying Nightmares\\" with 6 AV-8A Harriers based out of MCAS Yuma, Arizona. After boarding USS Tarawa, Amphibious Squadron Seven left San Diego on from 14 October 1980, visiting Subic Bay, Philippines and participating in exercises Valiant Blitz in the Philippines, Amphibious Squadron Seven spent almost a week at Phattaya Beach, from 22 to 27 December, before moving on to Singapore where she arrived on the 30th. After operations in Diego Garcia where Amphibious Squadron Seven's embarked marines carried out a landing exercise between 28 and 30 January, they headed south east for exercise Valiant Usher 81-3 off Lancelin, Western Australia with units of the Australian MIlitary. After Valiant Usher off Western Australia, VMA-513 and Amphibious Squadron One conducted an R&R; visit to Perth/Fremantle, Western Australia from 8-13 February 1981. The squadron later took part in exercises Team Spirit 81 and Valiant Flex 81–2 at Pusan (Busan) South Korea. HMM-265 (REIN) arrived back at MCAS Kaneohe Bay, Hawaii before or about 16 April 1981 with the detachments arriving home shortly after.

During Operation Desert Shield, they took part in Operation Sea Soldier IV the largest NVG troop lift ever in Marine Corps history in the country of Oman. The squadron then waited on amphibious shipping in the Persian Gulf awaiting the start of combat operations. The Dragons were part of the 5th Marine Expeditionary Brigade's amphibious feint into Kuwait, which succeeded in drawing the attention of Saddam Hussein's forces away from the actual attack that occurred inland. Upon conclusion of hostilities in the Persian Gulf region, HMM-265 returned to Hawaii. While en route, they were called upon to provide humanitarian assistance and disaster relief to the country of Bangladesh during Operation Sea Angel. During the operation the Dragons flew 770 Phrog hours in ten days. A CH-46E from HMM-265 training at Camp Hansen on Okinawa on January 31, 2007. The squadron had little time to rest before deploying to Okinawa in October 1991. During this deployment the Dragons provided support to HMX-1 for the Presidential visit to Tokyo. The Dragons were then called to Cambodia in support of Operation Full Accounting in 1992, where they assisted in the recovery of remains of US Servicemen lost during the Vietnam War. The Dragons of HMM-265 were relocated entirely to Marine Corps Air Station Futenma, Okinawa, Japan in early 1995. Heightened tensions in the Persian Gulf during the fall of 1998 brought the Dragons back on a no- notice deployment as the Aviation Combat Element (ACE) for the 31st Marine Expeditionary Unit. They participated in Operation Desert Fox in the Persian Gulf and Kuwait from November 1998 through February 1999. When the squadron returned, they had a short break before deploying again. This time, the Marines helped end a bloody civil war on the small island country of East Timor during Operation Stabilise in October 1999 and again during January and February 2000. =Global War on Terror= Deployed in support of Operation Iraqi Freedom operating from Al Asad Airbase, Al-Qa'im, and Korean Village from October 2004 to February 2005. = Losses = On 5 August 2017 a U.S. Marine Corps MV-22 Osprey, assigned to VMM-265 with the 31st Marine Expeditionary Unit, crashed in Shoalwater Bay on the east coast of Australia after taking off from the amphibious assault ship . 23 personnel were rescued, while three were missing .

Common nectar-consuming pollinators include mosquitoes, hoverflies, wasps, bees, butterflies and moths, hummingbirds, honeyeaters and bats. Nectar plays a crucial role in the foraging economics and evolution of nectar-eating species; for example, nectar foraging behavior is largely responsible for the divergent evolution of the African honey bee, A. m. scutellata and the western honey bee. Nectar is an economically important substance as it is the sugar source for honey. It is also useful in agriculture and horticulture because the adult stages of some predatory insects feed on nectar. For example, a number of parasitoid wasps (e.g. the social wasp species Apoica flavissima) rely on nectar as a primary food source. In turn, these wasps then hunt agricultural pest insects as food for their young. Nectar secretion increases as the flower is visited by pollinators. After pollination, the nectar is frequently reabsorbed into the plant. Etymology Nectar is derived from Greek nektar, the fabled drink of eternal life. The word is derived as a compound of nek, meaning death, and tar, meaning the ability to overcome. The common use of nectar refers to the \\"sweet liquid in flowers\\", first recorded in AD 1600. Floral nectaries A nectary or nectarine is floral tissue found in different locations in the flower, and is one of several secretory floral structures, including elaiophores and osmophores, producing nectar, oil and scent respectively. The function of these structures is to attract potential pollinators, which may include insects, including bees and moths, and vertebrates such as humming birds and bats. Nectaries can occur on any floral part, but they may also represent a modified part or a novel structure. The different types of floral nectaries include; * receptacle (receptacular: extrastaminal, intrastaminal, interstaminal) * hypanthium (hypanthial) * tepals (perigonal, tepal) * sepals (sepal) * petal (petal, corolla) * stamen (staminal, androecial: filament, anther, staminodal) * pistil (gynoecial: stigmatic, stylar) ** pistillodes (pistillodal, carpellodial) ** ovaries (ovarian: non-septal, septal, gynopleural) Most members of Lamiaceae have a nectariferous disc which surrounds the ovary base and derived from developing ovarian tissue. In most Brassicaceae the nectary is at the base of the stamen filament. Many monocotyledons have septal nectaries, which are at the unfused margins of the carpels. These exude nectar from small pores on the surface of the gynoecium. Nectaries may also vary in color, number, and symmetry.Willmer, Pat. Pollination and floral ecology. Princeton University Press, 2011. Nectaries can also be categorized as structural or non-structural. Structural nectaries refer to specific areas of tissue that exude nectar, such as the types of floral nectaries previously listed. Non-structural nectaries secrete nectar infrequently from non-differentiated tissues. The different types of floral nectaries coevolved depending on the pollinator that feeds on the plant's nectar. Nectar is secreted from epidermal cells of the nectaries, which have a dense cytoplasm, by means of trichomes or modified stomata. Adjacent vascular tissue conducts phloem bringing sugars to the secretory region, where it is secreted from the cells through vesicles packaged by the endoplasmic reticulum.Fahn, Abraham. “On the Structure of Floral Nectaries.” Botanical Gazette, vol. 113, no. 4, 1952, pp. 464–470. JSTOR, JSTOR, https://www.jstor.org/stable/2472434. The adjacent subepidermal cells may also be secretory. Flowers that have longer nectaries sometimes have a vascular strand in the nectary to assist in transport over a longer distance.Wallace, Gary D. \\"Studies of the Monotropoideae (Ericaceae). Floral nectaries: anatomy and function in pollination ecology.\\" American Journal of Botany (1977): 199-206. Pollinators feed on the nectar and depending on the location of the nectary the pollinator assists in fertilization and outcrossing of the plant as they brush against the reproductive organs, the stamen and pistil, of the plant and pick up or deposit pollen.Heil, Martin. \\"Nectar: generation, regulation and ecological functions.\\" Trends in plant science 16.4 (2011): 191-200. Nectar from floral nectaries is sometimes used as a reward to insects, such as ants, that protect the plant from predators. Many floral families have evolved a nectar spur. These spurs are projections of various lengths formed from different tissues, such as the petals or sepals. They allow for pollinators to land on the elongated tissue and more easily reach the nectaries and obtain the nectar reward. Different characteristics of the spur, such as its length or position in the flower, may determine the type of pollinator that visits the flower.Pacini, E. N. M. V. J., M. Nepi, and J. L. Vesprini. \\"Nectar biodiversity: a short review.\\" Plant Systematics and Evolution 238.1-4 (2003): 7-21. Defense from herbivory is often one of the roles of extrafloral nectaries. Floral nectaries can also be involved in defense. In addition to the sugars found in nectar, certain proteins may also be found in nectar secreted by floral nectaries. In tobacco plants, these proteins have antimicrobial and antifungal properties and can be secreted to defend the gynoecium from certain pathogens.Thornburg, Robert W., et al. \\"A major function of the tobacco floral nectary is defense against microbial attack.\\" Plant Systematics and Evolution 238.1-4 (2003): 211-218. Floral nectaries have evolved and diverged into the different types of nectaries due to the various pollinators that visit the flowers. In Melastomataceae, different types of floral nectaries have evolved and been lost many times. Flowers that ancestrally produced nectar and had nectaries may have lost their ability to produce nectar due to a lack of nectar consumption by pollinators, such as certain species of bees. Instead they focused on energy allocation to pollen production. Species of angiosperms that have nectaries use the nectar to attract pollinators that consume the nectar, such as birds and butterflies.Stein, Bruce A., and Hiroshi Tobe. \\"Floral nectaries in Melastomataceae and their systematic and evolutionary implications.\\" Annals of the Missouri Botanical Garden (1989): 519-531. In Bromeliaceae, septal nectaries (a form of gynoecial nectary) are common in species that are insect or bird pollinated. In species that are wind pollinated, nectaries are often absent because there is no pollinator to provide a reward for.Floral anatomy of Bromeliaceae, with particular reference to the evolution of epigyny and septal nectaries in commelinid monocot, Sajo, M. G., P. J. Rudall, and C. J. Prychid. \\"Floral anatomy of Bromeliaceae, with particular reference to the evolution of epigyny and septal nectaries in commelinid monocots.\\" Plant Systematics and Evolution 247.3-4 (2004): 215-231. In flowers that are generally pollinated by a long-tongued organism such as certain flies, moths, butterflies, and birds, nectaries in the ovaries are common because they are able to reach the nectar reward when pollinating. Sepal and petal nectaries are often more common in species that are pollinated by short-tongued insects that cannot reach so far into the flower.Rudall, Paula J., John C. Manning, and Peter Goldblatt. \\"Evolution of floral nectaries in Iridaceae.\\" Annals of the Missouri Botanical Garden (2003): 613-631. Extrafloral nectaries Extrafloral nectaries (also known as extranuptial nectaries) are specialised nectar-secreting plant glands that develop outside of flowers and are not involved in pollination, generally on the leaf or petiole (foliar nectaries) and often in relation to the leaf venation. They are highly diverse in form, location, size, and mechanism. They have been described in virtually all above-ground plant parts--including stipules, cotyledons, fruits, and stems, among others. They range from single-celled trichomes to complex cup-like structures that may or may not be vascularized. Like floral nectaries, they consist of groups of glandular trichomes (e.g. Hibiscus spp.) or elongated secretory epidermal cells. The latter are often associated with underlying vascular tissue. They may be associated with specialised pockets (domatia), pits or raised regions (e.g. Euphorbiaceae). The leaves of some tropical eudicots (e.g. Fabaceae) and magnoliids (e.g. Piperaceae) possess pearl glands or bodies which are globular trichomes specialised to attract ants. They secrete matter that is particularly rich in carbohydrates, proteins and lipids. Ants on extrafloral nectaries in the lower surface of a young Drynaria quercifolia frond While their function is not always clear, and may be related to regulation of sugars, in most cases they appear to facilitate plant insect relationships. In contrast to floral nectaries, nectar produced outside the flower generally have a defensive function. The nectar attracts predatory insects which will eat both the nectar and any plant-eating insects around, thus functioning as 'bodyguards'.Plant-Provided Food for Carnivorous Insects - Cambridge University Press Foraging predatory insects show a preference for plants with extrafloral nectaries, particularly some species of ants and wasps, which have been observed to defend the plants bearing them. Acacia is one example of a plant whose nectaries attract ants, which protect the plant from other insect herbivores. Among passion flowers, for example, extrafloral nectaries prevent herbivores by attracting ants and deterring two species of butterflies from laying eggs. In many carnivorous plants, extrafloral nectaries are also used to attract insect prey.Merbach, M. 2001. Nectaries in Nepenthes. In: C.M. Clarke Nepenthes of Sumatra and Peninsular Malaysia. Natural History Publications (Borneo), Kota Kinabalu. Loxura atymnus butterflies and yellow crazy ants consuming nectar secreted from the extrafloral nectaries of a Spathoglottis plicata bud Nylanderia flavipes ant visiting extrafloral nectaries of Senna Darwin understood that extrafloral nectar \\"though small in quantity, is greedily sought by insects\\" but believed that \\"their visits do not in any way benefit the plant\\". Instead, he believed that extrafloral nectaries were excretory in nature (hydathodes). Their defensive functions were first recognized by the Italian botanist Federico Delpino in his important monograph Funzione mirmecofila nel regno vegetale (1886). Delpino's study was inspired by a disagreement with Charles Darwin, with whom he corresponded regularly. Extrafloral nectaries have been reported in over 3941 species of vascular plants belonging to 745 genera and 108 families, 99.7% of which belong to flowering plants (angiosperms), comprising 1.0 to 1.8% of all known species. They are most common among eudicots, occurring in 3642 species (of 654 genera and 89 families), particularly among rosids which comprise more than half of the known occurrences. The families showing the most recorded occurrences of extrafloral nectaries are Fabaceae, with 1069 species, Passifloraceae, with 438 species, and Malvaceae, with 301 species. The genera with the most recorded occurrences are Passiflora (322 species, Passifloraceae), Inga (294 species, Fabaceae), and Acacia (204 species, Fabaceae). Other genera with extrafloral nectaries include Salix (Salicaceae), Prunus (Rosaceae) and Gossypium (Malvaceae). Foliar nectaries have also been observed in 39 species of ferns belonging to seven genera and four families of Cyatheales and Polypodiales. They are absent, however, in bryophytes, gymnosperms, early angiosperms, magnoliids, and members of Apiales among the eudicots. Phylogenetic studies and the wide distribution of extrafloral nectaries among vascular plants point to multiple independent evolutionary origins of extrafloral nectaries in at least 457 independent lineages. Components The main ingredients in nectar are sugars in varying proportions of sucrose, glucose, and fructose. In addition, nectars have diverse other phytochemicals serving to both attract pollinators and discourage predators. Carbohydrates, amino acids, and volatiles function to attract some species, whereas alkaloids and polyphenols appear to provide a protective function. The Nicotiana attenuata, a tobacco plant native to the US state of Utah, uses several volatile aromas to attract pollinating birds and moths. The strongest such aroma is benzylacetone, but the plant also adds bitter nicotine, which is less aromatic, so may not be detected by the bird until after taking a drink. Researchers speculate the purpose of this addition is to discourage the forager after only a sip, motivating it to visit other plants, therefore maximizing the pollination efficiency gained by the plant for a minimum nectar output.Chemical & Engineering News, Vol. 86 No. 35, 1 Sept. 2008, \\"Two-Faced Flowers\\", p. 11 Neurotoxins such as aesculin are present in some nectars such as that of the California buckeye.C.Michael Hogan (2008) Aesculus californica, Globaltwitcher.com, ed. N. Stromberg Nectar contains water, carbohydrates, amino acids, ions and numerous other compounds.  Other floral secretory structures  Some insect pollinated plants lack nectaries, but attract pollinators through other secretory structures. Elaiophores are similar to nectaries but are oil secreting. Osmophores are modified structural structures that produce volatile scents. In orchids these have pheromone qualities. Osmophores have thick domed or papillate epidermis and dense cytoplasm. Platanthera bifolia produces a nocturnal scent from the labellum epidermis. Ophrys labella have dome-shaped, papillate, dark-staining epidermal cells forming osmophores. Narcissus emit pollinator specific volatiles from the corona.

Engineered wood products are manufactured by binding together wood strands, fibers, or veneers with adhesives to form a composite material. Engineered wood includes plywood, oriented strand board (OSB) and fiberboard. The fact that a product is made from solid wood is often touted in advertisements. However, using solid wood has advantages and disadvantages. Comparison with engineered wood Perhaps the greatest advantage of solid wood is that the wood is the same all the way through, so repairs are relatively easy. Repairs to veneer are much more difficult and sometimes impossible. Solid wood furniture is strong enough to easily satisfy all furniture applications, and it can last for centuries. Society is still questioning whether furniture made of plywood (often made from pine) can do the same. Plywood and other engineered wood products used to make furniture are typically covered with a veneer such as Cherry. A definition of solid wood may be seen at :http://www.definitions.net/definition/solid%20wood It is common today for furniture manufacturers and retailers to advertise such veneered plywood furniture as made of \\"wood solids with cherry veneers\\". Most customers believe that to mean solid planks of less expensive woods such as poplar, etc., with expensive woods such as cherry used for veneers. However, \\"wood solids\\" is a term of art. The \\"wood solids\\" are simply plywood, or another engineered wood product. In the USA, the Federal Trade Commission doesn't allow furniture to be advertised as made of \\"solid wood\\" unless all exposed surfaces are in fact solid wood.http://www.ftc.gov/os/decisions/docs/vol114/FTC_VOLUME_DECISION_114_(_JANUARY_- _DECEMBER_1991)PAGES_486-586.pdf#page=47 Wednesday, 11 September 2019 Solid wood is expensive. Engineered wood (often advertised as wood solids) is not. Solid wood vs. hollow wood One of the most frequently made hollow wood structures are hollow core doors. Hollow core doors are much lighter than solid wood doors, cheaper and are easier to install. However, sound travels more freely through them, which can be a problem if the house is noisy or the occupants desire a lot of privacy. Also, hollow core doors should not be used as doors to the outside because they can more easily be broken open by robbers. Solid wood doors are slightly more fire resistant because the fire has to burn through more material, however, using a steel door will increase fire resistance by a much larger margin.

A westbound push-pull express train travelling from Edinburgh to Glasgow struck a cow, which had gained access to the track through a damaged fence from a field near Polmont railway station. The collision caused all six carriages and the locomotive of the train to derail, killing 13 people and injuring 61 others. The accident led to a debate about the safety of push-pull trains on British Rail. Background The accident happened on one of the busiest commuter lines in Scotland.\\"13 Dead, 44 Injured After Train Hits Cow\\". Associated Press, New York City. 31 July 1984. At the time of the accident, British Rail passenger trains between Glasgow Queen Street and Edinburgh Waverley were operated by the push-pull technique with a single British Rail Class 47 locomotive located at one end of the train at all timesSimmons, Jack; Biddle, Gordon (editors) 1997. Oxford Companion to British Railway History p 407. Oxford University Press. Glover, John (1999). Railway Operations p 58. Ian Allan, Shepperton, England. (the locomotive usually pulled the carriages from Glasgow to Edinburgh and pushed them on the return journey). At the other end of the train was a Driving Brake Standard Open (DBSO). DBSO carriages were introduced on the line in 1980 and consisted of a passenger carriage with a control cab at the front for the driver; a DBSO would be situated at the front of the train allowing the driver to control the locomotive with a set of remote controls from which control signals were sent through the lighting circuits of the train to the locomotive pushing from behind. This system meant that the train could continuously run between the two cities without having to allow time to switch the locomotive to the front of the train between departures. However, it left the front of the train vulnerable when being pushed from behind because the front end was lighter than the rear and had the risk of being pushed over an obstruction, leading to derailment.Stead, Jean. \\"'Push pull' trains to be altered after death crash inquiry / Call for safer trains after derailment in Scotland\\".

After passing the junction the train driver, John Tennant, spotted a cow on the line in the cutting on the approach to Falkirk High and made an emergency brake application; he had only between six and twelve seconds to react to the obstruction and apply the emergency brakes because of the curvature of the track. The dynamics of the train, with the locomotive pushing from behind, meant that when the brakes were applied from the DBSO at the front; there was a delay in transmission of the signal to the locomotive brakes to prevent a sudden backlash to the carriages in front;UK: Selby Disaster 28 February 2001, Push - Pull: the Hidden Dangers danger- ahead.railfan.net. 28 February 2001.

Retrieved 27 April 2013. The impact of the collision destroyed the animal, but a significant part of the carcass, later thought to be a leg bone, became trapped under the leading bogie of the DBSO, lifting it off the track and derailing it. The DBSO ran derailed for approximately and then veered to the left, before running up the edge of the cutting into trees at the top. It then turned on its side, as it was pushed round by the force of the train behind. The second vehicle, after climbing over the rear end of the DBSO, somersaulted end over end, eventually hitting the fifth vehicle as it ran past it. The third vehicle was hit by the DBSO, as it fell back down the wall of the cutting, after rebounding from the trees. The DBSO and third vehicle were so badly damaged that they had to be cut up on site. Casualties were mainly in the two leading vehicles; most fatalities were due to passengers being ejected through windows, being hit by other passengers or by objects as the vehicles were thrown about. The possibility of trains being fitted with seatbelts was raised and rejected, as it was again 20 years later after the derailment at Ufton Nervet in 2004. The main focus was that the light axle-loading of the DBSO had led to its being more easily derailed than a heavier vehicle would have been; modifications were put in place to lessen the chances of a recurrence of the derailment. This problem was to be revisited in the Great Heck accident in 2001, where a leading coach of a train being powered from the rear was again derailed by an object (this time a motor vehicle) on the line. It was theorised that the use of the locomotive in the rear further added to the severity of the crash, as the locomotive continued to push forward into the train after the derailment took place. This is a common situation found in accidents where push pull consists are used and would turn up as a factor in future accidents, both in the UK and abroad. Recommendations Memorial plaque at Polmont station The inquiry made recommendations which were followed; the main ones of which were: * Object deflectors were to be fitted to the leading vehicles of all trains that had an axle load of less than 16 tonnes.Report on improvements in the safety of passengers and staff involved in train accidents (PDF), RSSB.

Geography  Paamiut is located on the coast of Labrador Sea in the southern end of a small estuary called Kuannersooq (\\"Inlet\\").  History  Paamiut (Frederikshåb), 1878 Aerial view of the vicinity of Paamiut People have lived in the Paamiut area since around 1500 BC. The name Paamiut is Kalaallisut for \\"Those who Reside by the Mouth (of the fiord)\\". The trading post of Frederikshaab (sometimes anglicized as Frederick's Hopei.a., Lieber, Francis & al.

The community prospered on trading fur and whale products. It also became known for its soapstone artists. The town has one of the finest churches in Greenland, built in 1909 from wood in the Norwegian style. Following the warming climatic trends since the 1920s, Paamiut developed a booming cod industry between the 1950s and 1989, when the stock dwindled. In connection with a development plan called G60 Paamiut was chosen as to be the place to live for the entire population of the former Paamiut municipality. Therefore, the number of people living there rose significantly during that period. There is local museum downtown in original buildings from the previous century, among them a carpenter workshop and a salt warehouse. The Danish Crown Princely family visited the town as part of an official tour of Greenland in summer 2014.  Economy  As is the case for other towns of western Greenland, the sea is free of ice during the winter,Air Greenland , Destination overview: Paamiut while fishing is the primary occupation of the inhabitants of the region. Icebergs, coming adrift along the east coast of Greenland with the East Greenland Current and continuing up along the west coast with the West Greenland Current normally arrive in the autumn, bringing numerous seals marking this season as a great time for the local hunters.  Population  With 1,308 inhabitants as of 2020, it is the tenth-largest town in Greenland, down from the seventh in 2005. Paamiut has been losing population for almost every year in the last two decades: more than 31% relative to 1990 levels, almost 20% relative to 2000, and more than 16% relative to 2005.  Transport  Paamiut is a port of call for the Arctic Umiaq ferry service.AUL, Timetable 2009 In November 2007, the Paamiut Airport was built by Mittarfeqarfiit.

It has often been suggested that he was the inspiration behind Oscar Wilde's fictional Dorian Gray despite evidence to the contrary. His great nephew is the alternative rock musician Crispin Gray. Early life Born in the working-class district of Bethnal Green, London, he was the first of nine children. He left school at the age of 13 and began work as an apprentice metal-worker at the Royal Arsenal. He continued his education by attending a series of evening classes, studying French, German, Latin, music and art. In 1882 he passed the Civil Service exams and, five years later, the University of London matriculation exams. He joined the Foreign Office where he became a librarian. Aesthetic movement Gray is best known today as an aesthetic poet of the 1890s and as a friend of Ernest Dowson, Aubrey Beardsley and Oscar Wilde. He was also a talented translator, bringing works by the French Symbolists Stéphane Mallarmé, Paul Verlaine, Jules Laforgue and Arthur Rimbaud into English, often for the first time. He is purported to be the inspiration behind the title character in Wilde's The Picture of Dorian Gray, but distanced himself from this rumour. In fact, Wilde's story was serialised in Lippincott's Monthly Magazine a year before their relationship began (though allegedly Wilde officially denied any earlier association at Gray's request). His relationship with Wilde was initially intense, but had cooled for over two years by the time of Wilde's imprisonment. The relationship appears to have been at its height in the period 1891-1893. Literary output Gray's first notable publication was a collection of verse called Silverpoints (1893), consisting of sixteen original poems and thirteen translations from Verlaine (7), Mallarmé (1), Rimbaud (2), and Baudelaire (3). In his review of it Richard Le Gallienne distinguished it from the output of many of the 'decadent' poets in its inability to accomplish \\"that gloating abstraction from the larger life of humanity that marks the decadent\\". Gray's second volume, Spiritual Poems, chiefly done out of several languages (1896), defined his developing identity as a Catholic aesthete. It contained eleven original poems and twenty-nine translations from Jacopone da Todi, Prudentius, Verlaine, Angelus Silesius, Notker Balbulus, St John of the Cross, and other poets both Catholic and Protestant. Gray's later works were mainly devotional and often dealt with various Christian saints. The Long Road (1926) contained his best-known poem, \\"The Flying Fish\\", an allegory which had first appeared in The Dial in 1896. Gray produced one novel, Park: A Fantastic Story (1932), a surreal futuristic allegory about Fr Mungo Park, a priest who, in a dream, wakes up in a Britain which has become a post-industrial paradise inhabited by black people who are all Catholics, with the degenerate descendants of the white population living below ground like rats. The novel is characterised by a vein of dry humour, as when a Dominican prior wonders if Park could have met Aquinas. Gray's collected poems, with extensive notes, were printed in a 1988 volume edited by English professor and 1890s expert Ian Fletcher. His definitive biography was published in 1991 by Jerusha Hull McCormack, who also edited a selection of his prose works. McCormack published a fictionalized version of his life in 2000, under the title of The Man Who Was Dorian Gray. The Picture of John Gray by C.J. Wilmann, a play based on John Gray's life, premiered at The Old Red Lion Theatre, London, in August 2014.http://www.timeout.com/london/theatre/the-picture-of-john-gray The critic Valentine Cunningham has described Gray as the \\"stereotypical poet of the nineties\\". Catholicism and Personal life Like many of the artists of that period, Gray was a convert to Roman Catholicism. He was baptised on 14 February 1890, but soon lapsed. Wilde's trial appears to have prompted some intense soul-searching in Gray and he re-embraced Catholicism in 1895. In 1896 he gave this reversion poetic form in his volume Spiritual Poems: chiefly done out of several languages. He left his position at the Foreign Office and on 28 November 1898, at the age of 32, he entered the Scots College, Rome, to study for the priesthood. He was ordained by Cardinal Pietro Respighi at St John Lateran on 21 December 1901.Michael T. R. B. Turnbull (2006). St Peter's, Edinburgh, p. 7. He served as a priest in Edinburgh, first at Saint Patrick's Cowgate and then as founding parish priest at Saint Peter's Morningside. John Gray and Marc-Andre Raffalovich with a friend His most important supporter, and romantic partner, was Marc-André Raffalovich, a wealthy poet and early defender of homosexuality. Raffalovich himself became a Catholic in 1896 and joined the tertiary order of Dominicans. When Gray went to Edinburgh he settled nearby. He helped finance St Peter's Church in Morningside where Gray would serve as priest for the rest of his life. The two remained together until Raffalovich's sudden death in 1934. A devastated Gray died exactly four months later at St. Raphael's nursing home in Edinburgh after a short illness. Selected publications *Silverpoints (1893). Poems *The Blue Calendar (1895–1897).

It is the simplest of the telephone signaling systems, and uses the presence or absence of loop current to indicate the off-hook and on-hook loop states, respectively. It is used primarily for subscriber line signaling. An extension of the protocol that adds disconnect supervision is often called kewlstart. Protocol operation When the telephone is on-hook, the potential of the ring conductor of the local loop is held at a nominal level of -48V DC with respect to the tip conductor, provided by the telephone exchange or a foreign exchange station (FXS) interface. When the terminal initiates use of the line, it causes current to flow by closing the loop, and this signals the exchange to provide dial tone on the line and to expect dial signals, in form of DTMF digits or dial pulses, or a hook flash. When the loop is opened and current stops flowing for a certain period of time, the subscriber equipment signals that it has finished using the line; the telephone exchange resets the line to an idle state. For alerting an incoming call, the exchange rings the telephone by superimposing an alternating current (AC) signal onto the line of between 40 V and 90 V. The frequency of the signal is 20 Hz. In early exchanges, the ringing power was produced by a hand-cranked generator in the operator console of the exchange. Loop start signaling cannot detect simultaneous seizure of the line on both ends, commonly called glare, when used on trunk lines. The protocol imposes no requirement to the central office end to inform the subscriber end of distant far-end disconnection conditions. Such conditions are properly recognized in ground start signaling, a protocol primarily used on trunks between switching systems. Signaling extensions Modern loop start trunks often provide additional methods supervision to avoid the far- end-disconnect problem. Answer supervision and disconnect supervision are extensions to alert a foreign exchange office (FXO) interface that the remote party has answered or hung up. Answer supervision usually takes the form of the central office reversing the polarity of the line (battery reversal) for the duration of the call when it has been answered. For disconnect supervision the polarity may reverse back to its original state. Polarity switching results in reversals of the direction of loop current.Cisco IOS Voice, Video, and Fax Command Reference, Release 12.2 When disconnect supervision is implemented without answer supervision, polarity reversal may still be used, but this is rarely implemented in public telephone networks. Typically, it is implemented by removal of battery voltage from the line for a short period of time, resulting in loss of loop current. Interruption of loop current is variously called open loop disconnect, or an open switching interval. Additional types of loop signaling are signals to the central office that the subscriber intends to initiate a second simultaneous call, a three-way conference call, or answer a second incoming call. This signal is called flashing or hook flash, and is performed by interrupting the loop for a fraction of a second, typically at least 300 ms. The flash signal is longer than a rotary dial pulse, sometimes called a short flash, and is shorter than the time required for the on-hook condition. Disconnect supervision is also known as calling party control (CPC), and forward disconnect. =Kewlstart= Kewlstart is a coined term created in the Asterisk PBX open-source software community for an extension of loop start signaling for FXS and FXO telephony interfaces which adds disconnect supervision. This type of on-hook/off-hook supervision was in use in step-by-step systems as well as electronic switching systems in North America for many decades.AT&T;, Notes on Distance Dialing, 1975, Section 5, Signaling Disconnect supervision signals the called terminal device, typically an automated customer premises equipment, that the remote calling party has hung up. Disconnect supervision is implemented as an open switching interval (OSI), a period of several hundred milliseconds during which the loop current is interrupted. Some switching systems remove loop battery voltage for about 250 ms within 6 seconds after the far-end party disconnects.

Most middle 20th-century American payphones used coin-first ground start lines, with the starting ground connection provided by the coin itself, bridging a set of contacts as it passes through the coin chute. Ground start trunk Telephone companies typically provide two types of dial tone switched circuits – ground start and loop start. Private branch exchanges (PBX) work best on ground start trunks because those trunks can give them an on hook signal allowing for timely clearing. Normal single line telephones and key systems typically work on loop start lines. On loop start lines the PBX and central office may inadvertently seize the line simultaneously, a condition called glare, resulting in call collision since neither gets the expected response and no call can be initiated. In an idle circuit, the central office supplies –48V (nominally) on the ring conductor with respect to the tip side. A ground start PBX initiates an outgoing trunk seizure on an idle circuit by connecting of the ring lead to ground (maximum local resistance of 550 ohms). The central office senses this condition and grounds the tip lead. When the PBX senses this, it goes off- hook, then removes the ground on ring. The central office sends dial tone and the rest of the call proceeds normally. In ground start signaling, the central office initiates a call by grounding tip and putting the ringing signal on the line. To avoid glare, before the PBX originates an outgoing call, it must first verify that the CO has not already applied ground to tip. The PBX has 100ms to sense this condition. At the end of either an incoming or outgoing call, the PBX initiates disconnect by going on hook, or the central office initiates disconnect by opening tip. When the other end detects the loss of loop current, it also goes on hook and the call clears normally. A PBX user must be careful to order the correct type of trunk line from the local phone company and correctly install the telephone system at the PBX end – so that they match. Line equipment in most 20th-century central office switches had to be specially rewired to create a ground start line. Crossbar switch did it with a paper sleeve on the Vertical Off Normal contact, 5ESS switch by translation, and DMS-100 by a slide switch on the line card, all according to what the customer ordered.

Origins The name 'barbuta' when applied to a helmet is first recorded in an inventory made for the Gonzaga family of Mantua in 1407. The helmet can be considered as a specialised form of the sallet, both types of helmet being ultimately derivations of the earlier bascinet. The barbute resembles classical Greek helmets (most strikingly the Corinthian) and may have been influenced by the renewed interest in ancient artifacts common during this period.Oakeshott, pp. 109-110Grancsay, p. 187 Characteristics This type of helmet has been described as an example of formal beauty being the result of functional efficiency. The defining characteristic of the barbute is the forward extension of the sides of the helmet towards the mid-line; this gives protection to the sides of the user's face below the eyes. Regardless of the form of the combined vision and breath opening, T-shaped, Y-shaped or arch- shaped, this characteristic is always present. The edge of the T- shaped opening is almost always reinforced by a riveted-on iron rim, usually extending to the lower edge of the helmet.Pyhrr, p. 92 The Y-shaped form often incorporates a distinct projection to guard the nose, which otherwise would protrude from the combined ventilation and vision opening. At least one example exists incorporating an extremely elongated nasal, which is hinged. The barbute could be worn with a plate gorget.Leonello Boccia, Armi Italiane, Zanichelli, Bologna, 1966. However, the barbute was often worn with a stiffened mail collar, termed a \\"standard\\", which protected the throat and neck. Some examples of the barbute, as in a number of Italian sallets, were covered in a rich decorative fabric, typically heavy velvet. A number of surviving barbutes incorporate a keyhole-shaped hole at the apex of the skull for the attachment of a decorative crest. A contemporary painting commissioned by Federigo da Montefeltro, Duke of Urbino, shows a barbuta surmounted by a crest in the shape of a heraldic eagle.Grancsay, p. 184 Unlike the sallet, the barbute seems to have enjoyed little popularity outside Italy. Barbutes were most commonly raised from a single sheet of metal, however, modern metallurgy has shown that many Italian Renaissance helmets were essentially of iron faced with steel, which was annealed and quenched to give it the desired characteristics of a hard outer surface, with a ductile inner layer which prevented shattering.Grancsay, pp. 189-190 Many barbutes feature a low front- to-back ridge, raised from the top of the helmet's skull; this served to strengthen the helmet without adding a significant amount of weight.

J. Simpson murder case (officially The People of the State of California v. Orenthal James Simpson) was a criminal trial held in Los Angeles County Superior Court. Former National Football League (NFL) player, broadcaster and actor O. J. Simpson was tried and acquitted on two counts of murder for the June 12, 1994, slashing deaths of his ex-wife, Nicole Brown Simpson, and her friend Ron Goldman. At 12:10 a.m. on June 13, 1994, Brown and Goldman were found stabbed to death outside her condominium in the Brentwood neighborhood of Los Angeles. Simpson became a person of interest after police found a bloody glove behind his house and was formally charged with the murders on June 17. When he did not turn himself in at the agreed time (having previously been released after perfunctory questioning by police detectives), he became the object of a low-speed pursuit in a white 1993 Ford Bronco SUV owned and driven by his friend Al Cowlings. TV stations interrupted coverage of the 1994 NBA Finals to broadcast the incident. The pursuit was watched live by an estimated 95 million people. The pursuit, arrest, and trial were among the most widely publicized events in American history. The trial—often characterized as the trial of the century because of its international publicity—spanned eleven months, from the jury's swearing-in on November 9, 1994. Opening statements were made on January 24, 1995, and the verdict was announced on October 3, 1995 when Simpson was acquitted on two counts of murder. According to USA Today, the case has been described as the \\"most publicized\\" criminal trial in history. Simpson was represented by a high- profile defense team, also referred to as the \\"Dream Team\\", which was initially led by Robert Shapiro and subsequently directed by Johnnie Cochran. The team also included F. Lee Bailey, Alan Dershowitz, Robert Kardashian, Shawn Holley, Carl E. Douglas, and Gerald Uelmen. Barry Scheck and Peter Neufeld were two additional attorneys who specialized in DNA evidence. Deputy District Attorneys Marcia Clark, William Hodgman and later Christopher Darden thought that they had a strong case against Simpson, but Cochran was able to convince the jury that there was reasonable doubt concerning the validity of the State's DNA evidence, which was a relatively new form of evidence in trials at that time. The reasonable doubt theory included evidence that the blood sample had allegedly been mishandled by lab scientists and technicians, and there were questionable circumstances that surrounded other court exhibits. Cochran and the defense team also alleged other misconduct by the LAPD related to systemic racism and incompetence, in particular actions and comments of Detective Mark Fuhrman. The trial became historically significant because of the reaction to the verdict. The nation observed the same evidence presented at trial but a division along racial lines emerged in observers opinion of the verdict, which the media dubbed the \\"racial gap\\". A poll of Los Angeles County residents showed that most African Americans felt that justice had been served by the \\"not guilty\\" verdict, while the majority of whites and Latinos felt it was a racially motivated jury nullification by a mostly African-American jury. Polling shows the gap has narrowed since the trial, with over half of polled black respondents in 2015 stating they believed Simpson was guilty. After the trial, the families of Brown and Goldman filed a lawsuit against Simpson. On February 4, 1997, the jury unanimously found Simpson responsible for both deaths. The families were awarded compensatory and punitive damages totaling $33.5 million ($ million in dollars), but have received only a small portion of that monetary figure. In 2000, Simpson left California for Florida, one of the few states where personal assets such as homes and pensions cannot be seized to cover liabilities that were incurred in other states. Background =Simpson-Brown marriage= Simpson with his daughter Sydney, 1986 Nicole Brown met O. J. Simpson in 1977, when she was 18 and working as a waitress at the Daisy (a Beverly Hills private club). Simpson was married but the two began dating. Simpson filed for divorce in March 1979 and married Brown on February 2, 1985. Their marriage lasted seven years and produced two children, Sydney (b. 1985) and Justin (b. 1988). Brown filed for divorce on February 25, 1992, citing \\"irreconcilable differences\\". According to Dr. Lenore Walker, the Simpson-Brown marriage was a “textbook example of domestic abuse.” Brown signed a prenuptial agreement and was then prohibited from working while married. She wrote that she felt conflicted about notifying the police of the abuse because she was financially dependent on him. Nicole described an incident in which Simpson broke her arm during a fight but she lied and told the emergency room staff that she had fallen off her bike to protect Simpson from being arrested. She wrote about Simpson beating her in public, during sex and even in front of family and friends. Of the 62 incidents of abuse, the police were notified eight times and Simpson was arrested once. Brown said Simpson was stalking and harassing her after they divorced. This behavior is an intimidation tactic meant to force the victim to return to the abuser. Brown documented an incident where Simpson spied on her having sex with her new boyfriend. Afterwards, Brown said she felt her life was in danger because Simpson had said he would kill her if he ever found her with another man. She also drafted a will for herself as well. The women's shelter Sojourn received a call from Brown four days prior to her murder. She was considering going there because she was afraid of what her stalker ex- husband might do because she was refusing his pleas to reconcile their marriage and had reported a missing set of keys to her house a few weeks ago. They were later found on Simpson when he was arrested. =Frogmen= A few months before the murders, Simpson completed a film pilot for Frogmen, an adventure series similar to The A-Team in which he starred. Simpson played the lead role of \\"Bullfrog\\" Burke, who led a group of former U.S. Navy SEALs. He received \\"a fair amount of\\" military training including use of a knife for Frogmen, and holds a knife to the throat of a woman (playing the role of his daughter) in one scene. A 25-minute tape of the pilot, which did not include the knife scene, was found by investigators and watched on Simpson's television as they searched his house. The defense tried to block its use on these grounds, but Judge Ito allowed the tape to be shown. However, the prosecution never introduced it as evidence during the trial. It was reported that among the skills of the character of \\"Bullfrog Burke\\" was night killings and the \\"silent kill\\" technique of slashing the throat, and that SEALs regularly wear knit caps like the one found at the scene. The Navy calls these watch caps. =Mezzaluna= On Brown's last evening alive, she attended Sydney's dance recital at Paul Revere Middle School with her family. Simpson also attended. The family then went to eat at the Mezzaluna restaurant, and Simpson was not invited. Goldman was a waiter at Mezzaluna, though he was not assigned to Brown's table. After eating at Mezzaluna, Brown and her children went to Ben & Jerry's before returning home. Karen Lee Crawford, the manager of Mezzaluna, recounted that Brown's mother phoned the restaurant at 9:37 p.m. about a pair of lost eyeglasses. Crawford found them and put them in a white envelope. Goldman left the restaurant at 9:50 p.m., after his shift, to return the glasses by dropping them off at Brown's house. Simpson ate takeout food from McDonald's with Kato Kaelin, a bit-part actor and family friend who had been given the use of a guest house on Simpson's estate. Rumors circulated that Simpson had been on drugs at the time of the murder, and the New York Post's Cindy Adams reported that the pair had actually gone to a local Burger King, where a prominent drug dealer known only as \\"J. R.\\" had admitted to selling them crystal meth. Murders At 12:10 am. on June 13, 1994, Brown and Goldman were found murdered outside of Nicole's Bundy Drive condominium in Brentwood, Los Angeles. Both victims had been dead for about two hours prior to the arrival of police. The defense and the prosecution would agree that the murders took place some time between 10:15 and 11:00 pm. Nicole's akita dog with bloodstained paws led neighbors to the body. Steven Schwab testified that while he was walking his dog in the area near Brown's house at around 11:30 pm, he noticed that Brown's Akita dog had bloody paws but was uninjured. Schwab said he took the dog to a neighbor friend, who took the dog for a walk at approximately 12:00 midnight and testified that it tugged on its leash and led him to Brown's house. There he discovered Brown's dead body and flagged down a passing patrol car. Brown was found face down and barefoot at the bottom of the stairs leading to her front door, which was left open, with no signs of forced entry nor any evidence that anyone had entered the premises. The scene had a large amount of blood, but the bottoms of Brown's feet were clean, leading investigators to conclude she was murdered first and that she was the intended target. She had been stabbed multiple times in the head and neck, but had few defensive wounds on her hands, which implied a short struggle to investigators. The final cut was deep into her neck, severing her carotid artery. Brown did have a large bruise on the center of her upper back so investigators concluded that, after the assailant had killed Goldman, he returned to Brown's body, put his foot on her back (causing the bruise), pulled her head back by the hair and slit her throat. Her larynx could be seen through the gaping wound in her neck, and vertebra C3 was incised; her head remained barely attached to the body. Goldman lay nearby, close to a tree and the fence. He had been stabbed multiple times in the body and neck but like Brown had relatively few defensive wounds, which also signified a short struggle to investigators. Forensic evidence from the Los Angeles County coroner alleged that Goldman had been attacked and stabbed repeatedly in the neck and chest with one hand while the assailant restrained him with an arm chokehold. Near Goldman were the assailant's blue knit cap and left-hand glove — an extra-large, Aris Isotoner light leather glove and an envelope containing the glasses he was returning. Bloody shoe prints leaving the scene through the back gate were left by the assailant. To the left of some footprints were drops of blood from the assailant, who was apparently bleeding from their left hand. Measuring the distance between the steps showed the assailant walked away rather than ran. Flight to Chicago Prosecution exhibit of Map of Rockingham estate and showing trail of blood and position of parked Bronco. Simpson was scheduled for a red-eye flight at 11:45 p.m. to Chicago to play golf the following day at a convention with representatives of Hertz rental car Corporation, for whom he was a spokesman. Limousine driver Allan Park was scheduled to pick him up and take him to Los Angeles International Airport, and he arrived early at around 10:25. He drove around Simpson's estate to make sure he could navigate the area with the stretch limousine properly and testified he did not see Simpson's Ford Bronco parked outside. Park testified that he had been looking for and had seen the house number on the curb, and the prosecution presented exhibits to show that the position in which the Bronco was found the next morning was right next to the house number (implying that Park would surely have noticed the Bronco if it had been there at that time). The limo driver parked opposite the Ashford Street gate, then drove back to the Rockingham gate to check which driveway would have the best access for the limo. Deciding that the Rockingham entrance was too tight, he returned to the Ashford gate and began to buzz the intercom at 10:40, getting no response. He noted the house was dark and nobody appeared to be home as he smoked a cigarette and made several calls to his boss to get Simpson's home phone number. He then testified he saw a \\"shadowy figure resembling Simpson\\" emerge from the area where the Bronco was later found to be parked and approached the front entrance before aborting and heading towards the southern walkway. The same person then appeared shortly afterwards from the southern walkway and entered the house through the front door and the lights then came on. At the same time Park witnessed this \\"shadowy figure\\" head towards the south walkway where the bloody glove would later be found, Kato Kaelin had just previously been on the telephone with his friend, Rachel Ferrara. At approximately 10:50, something crashed into his wall, which he described as three \\"thumps\\" and which he feared was an earthquake. Kaelin hung up the phone and ventured outside to investigate the noises, but decided not to venture directly down the dark south pathway from which the thumps had originated. Instead, he walked to the front of the property, where he saw Park's limo outside the Ashford gate. Kaelin let Park in the Ashford gate, and Simpson finally came out the front door a few minutes later claiming he had overslept. Both Park and Kaelin would later testify that Simpson seemed agitated that night. Park noted that on the way to the airport Simpson complained about how hot it was and was sweating and rolled down the window, despite it not being a warm night. Park also testified that he loaded four luggage bags into the car that night, with one of them being a knapsack that Simpson would not let Park touch, insisting he load it himself. James Williams, skycap at LA International Airport, testified that Simpson only checked three bags at LAX that night. and the police determined that the missing luggage was the same knapsack Park had mentioned earlier. Another witness not used at trial, Skip Junis, claimed he saw Simpson at the airport discarding items from a bag into a trash can. Detectives Lange and Vannatter believe this is how the murder weapon, shoes and clothes that Simpson wore during the murder were disposed.Triumph of Justice, Petrocelli, p. 69 Simpson was running late but caught his flight. A passenger on the plane and the pilot testified to not noticing any cuts or wounds on Simpson's hands. A broken glass and bedsheets with blood on them were recovered from Simpson's hotel room, at the O'Hare Plaza Hotel. Peter Phillips, the former manager of the hotel, recalled Simpson asking for a Band-Aid for his finger at the front desk. Simpson arrest Simpson's mugshot, June 17, 1994 Soon after discovering the female victim was Nicole Simpson, LAPD commander Keith Bushey ordered detectives Lange, Vannatter, Philips and Fuhrman to notify Simpson of her death and to give him a ride to pick up his children, who had been in Nicole's condo at the time of the murders and were at the police station. They buzzed the intercom at the property for over 30 minutes but received no response. They noted the Bronco was parked on Rockingham at an awkward angle, with its back end out more than the front, and had blood on the door, which they feared meant someone inside might be hurt. Detective Vannatter then instructed Fuhrman to scale the wall and unlock the gate to allow the other three detectives to enter. The detectives would argue they entered without a search warrant because of exigent circumstances – specifically out of fear that someone inside might be injured. Fuhrman briefly interviewed Kato Kaelin, who told him that the Bronco belonged to Simpson and that earlier that night he had heard thumps on his wall. In a walk around the premises to inspect what may have caused the thumps, Fuhrman discovered a bloody glove; it was later determined to be the matching right hand glove of the one found at the murder scene. This evidence was determined to be probable cause to issue an arrest warrant for Simpson. Detective Ron Phillips testified that when he called Simpson in Chicago to tell him of his ex-wife's murder, he sounded \\"very upset\\" but was oddly unconcerned about the circumstances of her death. Philips noted that Simpson only asked if the children had seen the murder or Brown's body but was not concerned with the assailant(s) having harmed his children either. The police contacted Simpson at his home on Monday, June 13 and took him to Parker Center for questioning. Detective Lange noticed that Simpson had a cut on a finger on his left hand that was consistent with where the killer was bleeding from and asked Simpson how he got it. At first, he claimed he cut his finger accidentally while in Chicago after learning of Nicole's death. Lange then informed Simpson that blood was found inside his Bronco at which point Simpson admitted that he did cut his finger the same day as the murders but did not remember how. He voluntarily gave some of his own blood for comparison with evidence collected at the crime scene and was released.\\"O.J.: Made in America\\", Episode 3 Simpson hired Robert Shapiro on Tuesday, June 14 and he began assembling the Dream Team but noted that an increasingly distraught Simpson had begun treatment for depression. On Wednesday, June 15, preliminary results from DNA testing came back with matches to Simpson but the District Attorney delayed filing charges until all the results had come back. On Thursday June 16, Simpson spent Thursday night at the San Fernando Valley home of friend Robert Kardashian; Shapiro asked several doctors to attend to Simpson's purported fragile mental state. On Friday, June 17 detectives recommended that Simpson be charged with two counts of first-degree murder with special circumstance of multiple killings after the final DNA results came back. The LAPD notified Shapiro at 8:30 am on Friday that Simpson would have to surrender that day. At 9:30 am Shapiro went to Kardashian's home to tell Simpson that he would have to surrender by 11 am; an hour after the murder charges were filed. Simpson told Shapiro he wanted to surrender himself, to which the police agreed, believing someone as famous as Simpson would not attempt to flee. The police even agreed to delay his surrender until 12pm so Simpson could be seen by a mental health specialist after showing signs of suicidal depression; he updated his will, called his mother and children, and wrote three sealed letters: one to his children, another to his mother, and one to the public. More than 1,000 reporters waited for Simpson's perp walk at the police station, but he did not arrive as stipulated. The LAPD then notified Shapiro that Simpson would be arrested at Kardashian's home. Kardashian and Shapiro told Simpson this but when the police arrived an hour later, Simpson was gone along with Al Cowlings. The three sealed letters he had written were left behind. At 1:50 pm, Commander Dave Gascon, LAPD's chief spokesman, publicly declared that Simpson was a fugitive; the police issued an all-points bulletin for him and an arrest warrant for Cowlings. =\\"Suicide note\\"= At 5 pm, Kardashian and one of his defense lawyers read Simpson's public letter. In the letter, Simpson sent greetings to 24 friends and wrote, \\"First everyone understand I had nothing to do with Nicole's murder.\\" He described the fights with Brown and their decision not to reconcile as normal in a long relationship, and asked the media \\"as a last wish\\" not to bother his children. He wrote to then girlfriend Paula Barbieri \\"I'm sorry... we're not going to have, our chance... As I leave, you'll be in my thoughts.\\" It also included \\"I can't go on\\" and an apology to the Goldman family. The letter concluded, \\"Don't feel sorry for me. I have had a great life, great friends. Please think of the real O.J. and not this lost person.\\" Most interpreted this as a suicide note; Simpson's mother Eunice collapsed after hearing it, and reporters joined the search for Simpson. At Kardashian's press conference, Shapiro said that he and Simpson's psychiatrists agreed with the suicide note interpretation. Through television, Shapiro appealed to Simpson to surrender. =Bronco chase= News helicopters searched the Los Angeles highway system for Cowlings's white Ford Bronco (Cowlings and Simpson both had white Broncos). At 5:51 pm, Simpson reportedly called 9-1-1; the call was traced to the Santa Ana Freeway, near Lake Forest. At around 6:20 pm, a motorist in Orange County notified California Highway Patrol after seeing someone believed to be Simpson riding in the Bronco on the I-5 freeway heading north, driven by Cowlings. The police tracked calls placed from Simpson on his cell phone. At 6:45 pm, police officer Ruth Dixon saw the Bronco head north on Interstate 405. When she caught up to it, Cowlings yelled out that Simpson was in the back seat of the vehicle and had a gun to his own head. The officer backed off, but followed the vehicle at , with up to 20 police cars following her in the chase. Zoey Tur of KCBS-TV was the first to find Simpson from a news helicopter, after colleagues heard that the FBI's mobile phone tracking had located him at the El Toro Y. More than nine news helicopters eventually joined the pursuit; Tur compared the fleet to Apocalypse Now, and the high degree of media participation caused camera signals to appear on incorrect television channels. The chase was so long that one helicopter ran out of fuel, forcing its station to ask another for a camera feed. Knowing that Cowlings was listening to KNX-AM, sports announcer Peter Arbogast called Simpson's former USC football coach John McKay and connected him to Simpson. As both men wept Simpson told McKay \\"OK, Coach, I won’t do anything stupid. I promise\\" off the air. \\"There is no doubt in my mind that McKay stopped O.J. from killing himself in the back of that Bronco\\", Arbogast said. McKay reiterated on radio his pleas to Simpson to turn himself in instead of committing suicide; \\"My God, we love you, Juice. Just pull over and I'll come out and stand by you all the rest of my life\\". Walter Payton, Vince Evans, and others from around the country also pleaded with Simpson over radio to surrender. At Parker Center, officials discussed how to persuade Simpson to surrender peacefully. Detective Tom Lange, who had interviewed Simpson about the murders on June 13, realized that he had Simpson's cell phone number and called him repeatedly. A colleague hooked a tape recorder up to Lange's phone and captured a conversation between Lange and Simpson in which Lange repeatedly pleaded with Simpson to \\"throw the gun out [of] the window\\" for the sake of his mother and children. Simpson apologized for not turning himself in earlier that day and responded that he was \\"the only one who deserved to get hurt\\" and was \\"just gonna go with Nicole\\". He asked Lange to \\"just let me get to the house\\" and said \\"I need [the gun] for me\\". Cowlings's voice is overheard in the recording (after the Bronco had arrived at Simpson's home surrounded by police) pleading with Simpson to surrender and end the chase peacefully. Los Angeles streets emptied and drink orders stopped at bars as people watched on television. Every television showed the chase; ABC, NBC, CBS and CNN, and local news outlets interrupted regularly scheduled programming to cover the incident, watched by an estimated 95 million viewers nationwide; only 90 million had watched that year's Super Bowl. While NBC continued coverage of Game 5 of the NBA Finals between the New York Knicks and the Houston Rockets at Madison Square Garden, the game appeared in a small box in the corner while Tom Brokaw covered the chase. The chase was covered live by ABC anchors Peter Jennings and Barbara Walters on behalf of the network's five news magazines, which achieved some of their highest-ever ratings that week. The chase was broadcast internationally, with Gascon's relatives in France and China seeing him on television. Thousands of spectators and onlookers packed overpasses along the route of the chase, waiting for the white Bronco. In a festival-like atmosphere, many had signs urging Simpson to flee. Spectators shouting \\"Go, O.J., go\\"—the famous slogan from Simpson's Hertz commercials—and encouraging the actions of a possibly suicidal murder suspect outraged Jim Hill, among those broadcasting pleas to their friend to surrender. Jack Ferreira and Mike Smith were among those watching the chase not knowing why; they felt part of a \\"common emotional experience\\", one author wrote, as they \\"wonder[ed] if O. J. Simpson would commit suicide, escape, be arrested, or engage in some kind of violent confrontation. Whatever might ensue, the shared adventure gave millions of viewers a vested interest, a sense of participation, a feeling of being on the inside of a national drama in the making\\". Simpson reportedly demanded that he be allowed to speak to his mother before he would surrender. The chase ended at 8:00 p.m. at his Brentwood estate, later, where his son, Jason, ran out of the house, \\"gesturing wildly\\", and 27 SWAT officers awaited. After remaining in the Bronco for about 45 minutes, Simpson exited at 8:50 pm with a framed family photo and went inside for about an hour; a police spokesman stated that he spoke to his mother and drank a glass of orange juice, causing reporters to laugh. Shapiro arrived, and Simpson surrendered to authorities a few minutes later. In the Bronco, police found \\"$8,000 in cash, a change of clothing, a loaded .357 Magnum, a United States passport, family pictures, and a disguise kit with a fake goatee and mustache\\". Simpson was booked at Parker Center and taken to Men's Central Jail; Cowlings was booked on suspicion of harboring a fugitive and held on $250,000 bail. The Bronco chase, the suicide note, and the items found in the Bronco were not presented as evidence in the criminal trial. Marcia Clark conceded that such evidence did imply guilt yet defended her decision, citing the public reaction to the chase and suicide note as proof the trial had been compromised by Simpson's celebrity status. Most of the public, including Simpson's friend Al Michaels, interpreted his actions as an admission of guilt yet thousands of people encouraged him to flee prosecution and were sympathetic to his feelings of guilt. Preliminary hearing On June 20, Simpson was arraigned and pleaded not guilty to both murders and was held without bail. The following day, a grand jury was called to determine whether to indict him for the two murders but was dismissed on June 23, as a result of excessive media coverage that could have influenced its neutrality. Instead, authorities held a probable cause hearing to determine whether to bring Simpson to trial. California Superior Court Judge Kathleen Kennedy-Powell ruled on July 7that there was sufficient evidence to bring Simpson to trial for the murders. Bail was set at $10 million. At his second arraignment on July 22, when asked how he pleaded to the murders, Simpson firmly stated: \\"Absolutely, one hundred percent, not guilty.\\" Jill Shively testified to the grand jury that soon after the time of the murders she saw a white Ford Bronco speeding away from Bundy Drive in such a hurry that it almost collided with a Nissan at the intersection of Bundy and San Vicente Boulevard, and that she recognized Simpson's voice. She talked to the television show Hard Copy for $5,000, after which prosecutors declined to use her testimony at trial. Jose Camacho of Ross Cutlery provided store receipts showing Simpson had purchased a 12-inch (305 mm) stiletto knife six weeks before the murders. The knife was recovered and determined to be similar to the one the coroner said caused the stab wounds. The prosecution did not present this evidence at trial after Camacho sold his story to the National Enquirer for $12,500. Tests on the knife determined that an oil used on new cutlery was still present on the knife, indicating it had never been used. Former NFL player and pastor Rosey Grier visited Simpson on November 13 at the Los Angeles County Jail in the days following the murders. A jailhouse guard, Jeff Stuart, testified to Judge Ito that at one point Simpson yelled to Grier that he \\"didn't mean to do it,\\" after which Grier had urged Simpson to come clean. Ito ruled that the evidence was inadmissible as hearsay. At first, Simpson's defense sought to show that one or more hitmen hired by drug dealers had murdered Brown and Goldman – giving Brown a \\"Colombian necktie\\" – because they were looking for Brown's friend, Faye Resnick, a known cocaine user who had failed to pay for her drugs. She had stayed for several days at Brown's condo until entering rehab four days before the killings. Ito ruled that the drug killer theory was \\"highly speculative\\" with no evidence to support it. Consequently, Ito barred the jury from hearing it and prohibited Christian Reichardt from testifying about his former girlfriend Resnick's drug problems. Rosa Lopez, a neighbor's Spanish-speaking housekeeper, stated on August 18 that she saw Simpson's Bronco parked outside his house at the time of the murders, supporting his claim he was home that night. During cross-examination by Clark, Lopez admitted she was not sure what time she saw Simpson's Bronco but the defense still intended to call her. However, a taped July 29 statement by Lopez did not mention seeing the Bronco but did mention another housekeeper was also there that night, Sylvia Guerra. Prosecutors then spoke with Guerra, who said Lopez was lying and claimed the defense offered both housekeepers $5,000 to say they saw the Bronco that night. When Ito warned the defense that Guerra's claim as well as the earlier statement not mentioning the Bronco and the tape where Clark claims \\"that [Lopez] is clearly being coached on what to say\\" will be shown to the jury if Lopez testifies, they dropped her from the witness list. Trial Judge left Simpson wanted a speedy trial, and the defense and prosecuting attorneys worked around the clock for several months to prepare their cases. The trial began on January 24, 1995, seven months after the murders, and was televised by closed-circuit TV camera via Court TV, and in part by other cable and network news outlets, for 134 days. Judge Lance Ito presided over the trial in the C.S. Foltz Criminal Courts Building. =Jury= District Attorney Gil Garcetti elected to file charges in downtown Los Angeles, as opposed to Santa Monica, in which jurisdiction the crimes took place. The Los Angeles Superior Court then decided to hold the trial in Downtown Los Angeles instead of Santa Monica due to safety issues at the Santa Monica Court house. The decision may have impacted the trial's outcome because it resulted in a jury pool that was less educated, had lower incomes, and comprised mostly of African Americans. Richard Gabriel, a jury consultant for Simpson, wrote that more educated jurors with higher incomes are more likely to accept the validity of DNA evidence and the argument that domestic violence is a prelude to murder. Gabriel notes that African Americans, unlike other minorities, are far more likely to be receptive to the claim of racially motivated fraud by the police. C.S. Foltz Criminal Courts BuildingIn October 1994, Judge Lance Ito started interviewing 304 prospective jurors, each of whom had to fill out a 75-page questionnaire. On November 3, twelve jurors were seated with twelve alternates. Over the course of the trial, ten were dismissed for a wide variety of reasons. Only four of the original jurors remained on the final panel. According to media reports, Clark believed women, regardless of race, would sympathize with the domestic violence aspect of the case and connect with Nicole personally. On the other hand, the defense's research suggested that black women would not be sympathetic to Nicole, who was white, because of tensions about interracial marriages. Both sides accepted a disproportionate number of female jurors. From an original jury pool of 40 percent white, 28 percent black, 17 percent Hispanic, and 15 percent Asian, the final jury for the trial had ten women and two men, of whom nine were black, two white and one Hispanic. The jury was sequestered for 265 days, the most in American history. It broke the previous record with more than a month left to go. On April 5, 1995, juror Jeanette Harris was dismissed because Judge Ito learned she had failed to disclose an incident of domestic abuse. Afterwards, Harris gave an interview and accused the deputies of racism and claimed the jurors are dividing themselves along racial lines. Ito then met with the jurors, who all denied Harris's allegations of racial tension among themselves. The following day, Ito dismissed the three deputies anyway, which upset the jurors that didn't complain because the dismissal appeared to lend credence to Harris's allegations, which they all denied. On April 21, thirteen of the eighteen jurors refused to come to court until they spoke with Ito about it. Ito then ordered them to court and the 13 protesters responded by wearing all black and refusing to come out to the jury box upon arrival. The media described this incident as a \\"Jury Revolt\\" and the protesters wearing all black as resembling a \\"funeral procession\\". =Prosecution case= The two lead prosecutors were Deputy District Attorneys Marcia Clark and Christopher Darden. Clark was designated as the lead prosecutor and Darden became Clark's co-counsel. Prosecutors Hank Goldberg and William Hodgman, who have successfully prosecuted high-profile cases in the past, assisted Clark and Darden. Two prosecutors who were DNA experts, Rockne Harmon and George \\"Woody\\" Clarke, were brought in to present the DNA evidence in the case and were assisted by Prosecutor Lisa Kahn. Theory The prosecution argued that the domestic violence within the Simpson-Brown marriage culminated in her murder. Simpson's history of abusing Nicole resulted in their divorce and him pleading guilty to one count of domestic violence in 1989. On the night of the murders, Simpson attended a dance recital for his daughter and was reportedly angry with Nicole because of a black dress that she wore, which he said was \\"tight\\". Simpson's then girlfriend, Paula Barbieri, wanted to attend the recital with Simpson but he did not invite her. After the recital, Simpson returned home to a voicemail from Barbieri ending their relationship. Simpson then drove over to Nicole Brown's home to reconcile their relationship as a result and when Nicole refused, Simpson killed her in a \\"final act of control.\\" Ron Goldman then came upon the scene and was murdered as well. Domestic violence The prosecution opened its case by calling LAPD 911 dispatcher Sharon Gilbert and playing a four-minute 9-1-1 call from Nicole Brown Simpson on January 1, 1989, in which she expressed fear that Simpson would physically harm her and Simpson himself is even heard in the background yelling at her and possibly hitting her as well. The officer who responded to that call, Detective John Edwards, testified next that when he arrived, a severely beaten Nicole Brown Simpson ran from the bushes where she was hiding and to the detective screaming \\"He's going to kill me, he's going to kill me,\\" referring to O.J. Simpson. Pictures of Nicole Brown's face from that night were then shown to the jury to confirm his testimony. That incident led to Simpson's arrest and eventual pleading of no contest to one count of domestic violence for which he received probation for one year. LAPD officer and long time friend of both Simpson and Brown, Ron Shipp, testified on February 1, 1995 that Simpson told him the day after the murders that he did not want to take a polygraph test offered to him by the police because \\"I've had a lot of dreams about killing her. I really don't know about taking that thing.\\" The prosecution then called Denise Brown, Nicole Brown's sister, to the witness stand. She tearfully testified to many episodes of domestic violence in the 1980s, when she saw Simpson pick up his wife and hurl her against a wall, then physically throw her out of their house during an argument. She also testified that Simpson was agitated with Nicole the night of his daughter's dance recital as well, the same night Nicole was murdered. Although a home videotape taken immediately after the dance recital showed a cheerful Simpson being given a kiss by Denise Brown, Kato Kaelin corroborated Denise Brown's claim that Simpson was \\"upset\\" with Nicole because of the black dress she wore, which he said was \\"tight\\". The prosecution planned to present 62 separate incidents of domestic violence, including three previously unknown incidents Brown had documented in several letters she had written and placed in a bank safety deposit box. Judge Ito denied the defense's motion to suppress the incidents of domestic violence, but only allowed witnessed accounts to be presented to the jury because of Simpson's Sixth Amendment rights. The letters Nicole Brown had written and the statements she made to friends and family were rulled inadmissible as hearsay because Brown was dead and unable to be cross-examined. Despite this, the prosecution had witnesses for 44 separate incidents they planned to present to the jury. However, the prosecution dropped the domestic violence portion of their case on June 20, 1995. Marcia Clark stated it was because they believed the DNA evidence against Simpson was insurmountable, but the media speculated it was because of the comments made by dismissed juror Jeanette Harris. Christopher Darden later confirmed that to be true. Harris was dismissed on April 6 because she failed to disclose that she was a victim of domestic violence from her ex-husband. But afterwards, Harris gave an interview and called the evidence of Simpson's abuse of Nicole \\"a whole lot of nothing\\" and also said \\"that doesn't mean he is guilty of murder\\". This dismissal of Simpson's abusive behavior from a female juror, who was also a victim of such abuse by her own husband, convinced the prosecution that the jury was not receptive to the domestic violence argument. After the verdict, the jurors called the domestic violence portion of the case a \\"waste of time\\". Shapiro, Dershowitz, and Uelmen later admitted they believe that race played a factor in the jurors' dismissal of Nicole Brown's abuse by Simpson. The defense retained renowned advocate for victims of domestic abuse, Dr. Lenore E. Walker. Cochran said that she would testify that Simpson doesn't fit the profile of an abuser that would murder his spouse. Dr. Walker's colleagues were appalled by her decision to defend Simpson and accused her of betraying her advocacy for a $250,000 retainer. Dr. Walker was dropped from the witness list for \\"tactical reasons\\" after she submitted her report on the case. In it, she opines that the statistic from Dershowitz that of the two million incidents of abuse per year, only 2,000 victims are actually murdered by their spouses as being misleading because Brown was already dead. The relevant statistic was \\"of the murdered spouses who were also victims of abuse, what percentage of them were murdered by their current or ex-husband?\\" When she reported that number was 80.3%, they dropped her from the witness list. The revelation of Simpson's abuse of Nicole is credited with turning public opinion against him. The public shock at the reason why Dr. Walker was dropped from the defense witness list is credited with transforming public opinion on spousal abuse from a private familial matter to a serious public health issue. Timeline Los Angeles County Chief Medical Examiner, Dr. Lakshmanan Sathyavagiswaran, testified on June 14, 1995 that Brown's time of death was estimated as between 10:00pm and 10:30pm. Kato Kaelin testified on March 22, 1995 that he last saw Simpson at 9:36pm that evening. Simpson was not seen again until 10:54pm when he answered the intercom at the front door for the limousine driver, Allan Park. Simpson had no alibi for approximately one hour and 18 minutes during which time the murders took place. Allan Park testified on March 28, 1995 that he arrived at Simpson's home at 10:25pm on the night of the murders and stopped at the Rockingham entrance: Simpson's Bronco was not there. He then drove over to the Ashford entrance and rang the intercom three times, getting no answer, starting at 10:40pm. At approximately 10:50pm he saw a \\"tall African American shadowy figure resembling Simpson\\" approach the front door before aborting towards the southern walkway that leads to Kaelin's bungalow. Park's testimony was significant because it explained the location of the glove found at Simpson's home. The blood trail from the Bronco to the front door was easily understood but the glove was found on the other side of the house. Park said the \\"shadowy figure\\" initially approached the front door before heading down the southern walkway which leads to where the glove was found by Fuhrman. The prosecution believed that Simpson had driven his Bronco to and from Brown's home to commit the murders, saw that Park was there and aborted his attempt to enter through the front door and tried to enter through the back instead. He panicked and made the sounds that Kaelin heard when he realized that the security system would not let him enter through the rear entrance. He then discarded the glove, came back and went through the front door. During cross examination, Park conceded that he could not identify the figure but said he saw that person enter the front door and afterwards Simpson answered and said he was home alone but he was calling a friend over. Park conceded that he did not notice any cuts on Simpson's left hand but added \\"I shook his right hand, not his left.\\" DNA evidence and blood trail Crime scene photo at Nicole Brown's home. The prosecution presented a total of 108 exhibits, including 61 drops of blood, of DNA evidence allegedly linking Simpson to the murders. With no witnesses to the crime, the prosecution was dependent on DNA as the only physical evidence linking Simpson to the crime. The volume of DNA evidence in this case was unique and the prosecution believed they could reconstruct how the crime was committed with enough accuracy to resemble an eyewitness account. Marcia Clark stated in her opening statements that there was a \\"trail of blood from the Bundy Crime scene through Simpson's Ford Bronco to his bedroom at Rockingham\\". * Simpson's DNA found on blood drops next to the bloody footprints near the victims at the Bundy crime scene. Probability of error was 1-in-9.7 billion. * Simpson's DNA found on a trail of blood drops leading away from the victims, towards and on the back gate at Bundy. Probability of error was 1-in-200. * Simpson, Ron Goldman and Nicole Brown's DNA found on blood on the outside of the door and inside Simpson's Bronco. Probability of error was 1-in-21 billion. * Simpson's DNA found on blood drops leading from the area where his Bronco was parked at Simpson's Rockingham home to the front door entrance. * Simpson, Brown and Goldman's DNA on a bloody glove found behind his home. * Simpson and Nicole Brown's DNA found on blood on a pair of socks in Simpson's bedroom. Probability of error was 1-in-6.8 billion. Hair and fiber evidence LAPD criminalist and hair fiber expert Susan Brockbank testified on June 27, 1995 and FBI Special Agent and fiber expert Doug Deedrick testified on June 29, 1995 to the following findings: * The fibers from the glove found at Simpson's home microscopically match the one found at the crime scene, proving they were each other's mate. * Both of the victims, the two gloves, and the Blue knit cap worn by the killer had hair consistent with Simpson. The hair in the Blue Knit cap worn by the killer was embedded in the seams, indicating it was there from being worn repeatedly. * Dark blue cotton clothing fibers were found on both victims. The video from the Dance recital that Simpson attended earlier that night shows him wearing a similarly colored shirt. Kato Kaelin testified that Simpson was still wearing that shirt when they got home from McDonalds but not anymore when he answered the door for the limousine driver. The police searched his home but the shirt was never found. * Hair consistent with Goldman was found on Brown and clothing fibers consistent with Brown was found on Goldman. This supported the prosecution's theory that the assailant killed Brown first, then Goldman, and afterwards returned to Brown to cut her throat. The hair consistent with Brown that was found on the Rockingham glove was torn which also supports the prosecution claim that the killer grabbed Brown by her hair to cut her throat. * Fibers that were only used in the 1993-1994 model year Ford Bronco, the same car that Simpson owns, were found on both victims, the knit cap and on both gloves. * The glove found at Simpson's home that belonged to the murderer had hair and clothing fibers consistent with Simpson, Brown and Goldman as well as fibers from a 1993-1994 Ford Bronco and Brown's Akita dog.  Shoe Print Analysis  On June 19, 1995, FBI shoe print expert William J. Bodziak, testified that the bloody shoe prints found at the crime scene and inside Simpson's Bronco were made from a rare and expensive pair of Bruno Magli Italian shoes. He determined the shoes were a size 12, the same size that Simpson wears, and are only sold at Bloomingdales. Only 29 pairs of that size were sold in the U.S. and one of them was sold at the same store that Simpson often buys his shoes from. Bodziak also testified that, despite two sets of footprints at the crime scene, only one attacker was present because they were all made by the same shoes. During cross-examination Bailey suggested the murderer deliberately wore shoes that were the wrong size, which Bodziak dismissed as \\"ridiculous\\". Simpson denied ever owning a pair of those \\"ugly ass shoes\\" and there was only circumstantial evidence he did. Bloomingdales employee Samuel Poser testified he remembered showing Simpson those shoes but there was no store record of him purchasing them. Although the prosecution could not prove that Simpson owned a pair of those shoes, Bodziak testified that a similar bloody shoe print was left on the floor inside Simpson's Bronco. Scheck suggested that Fuhrman broke into the Bronco and left the footprint there; he produced a photo of Fuhrman walking through a puddle of blood. Bodziak admitted that he was not able to confirm that the shoe print in the car definitely came from a Bruno Magli shoe, but dismissed Scheck's claim because none of the shoe prints at the crime scene were made by Fuhrman's shoes, making it unlikely he could have made a bloody shoe print in the Bronco. =Defense case= alt= Simpson hired a team of high-profile defense lawyers, initially led by Robert Shapiro, who was previously a civil lawyer known for settling, and then subsequently by Johnnie Cochran, who at that point was known for police brutality and civil rights cases. The team included noted defense attorney F. Lee Bailey, Robert Kardashian, Harvard appeals lawyer Alan Dershowitz, his student Robert Blasier, and Dean of Santa Clara University School of Law Gerald Uelmen. Assisting Cochran were Carl E. Douglas and Shawn Holley. Barry Scheck and Peter Neufeld were also hired; they headed the Innocence Project and specialized in DNA evidence. Simpson's defense was said to have cost between US$3 million and $6 million; the media dubbed the group of talented attorneys the Dream Team.  Theory  The defense team's reasonable doubt theory was summarized as \\"compromised, contaminated, corrupted\\" in opening statements. They argued that the DNA evidence against Simpson was \\"compromised\\" by the mishandling of criminalists Dennis Fung and Andrea Mazzola during the collection phase of evidence gathering, and that 100% of the \\"real killer(s)\\" DNA had vanished from the evidence samples. The evidence was then \\"contaminated\\" in the LAPD crime lab by criminalist Collin Yamauchi, and Simpson's DNA from his reference vial was transferred to all but three exhibits. The remaining three exhibits were planted by the police and thus \\"corrupted\\" by police fraud. The defense also questioned the timeline, claiming the murders happened around 11:00pm that night. Timeline Dr. Robert Huizenga testified on July 14, 1995 that Simpson was not physically capable of carrying out the murders due to chronic arthritis and old football injuries. During cross-examination, the prosecution produced an exercise video that Simpson made a few weeks before the murders titled O.J. Simpson Minimum Maintenance: Fitness for Men, which demonstrated that Simpson was anything but frail. Dr. Huizenga admitted afterwards that Simpson could have committed the murders if he was in \\"the throes of an adrenaline rush.\\" Dr. Michael Baden, a forensic pathologist, testified on August 10, 1995 and claimed the murders happened closer to 11:00pm, which is when Simpson has an alibi. He stated that Brown was still conscious and standing when her throat was cut and that Goldman was standing and fighting his assailant for ten minutes with a lacerated jugular vein. After the trial, Baden admitted his claim of Goldman's long struggle was inaccurate and that testifying for Simpson was a mistake. Critics claimed that Baden knowingly gave false testimony in order to collect a $100,000 retainer because the week before he testified, Dr. Gerdes admitted that Goldman's blood was in Simpson's Bronco despite Goldman never having an opportunity within his lifetime to be in the Bronco. Compromised and contaminated Barry Scheck and Peter Neufeld argued that the results from the DNA testing were not reliable because the police were \\"sloppy\\" in collecting and preserving it from the crime scene. Fung and Mazzola did admit to making several mistakes during evidence collection which included not always changing gloves between handling evidence items, packaging and storing the evidence items using plastic bags, rather than paper bags as recommended, and storing them in the police van, which was not refrigerated, for up to seven hours after collection. This, they argued, would allow bacteria to degrade all of the \\"real killer(s)\\" DNA and thus make the samples more susceptible to cross-contamination in the LAPD crime lab. The prosecution denied that the mistakes made by Fung and Mazzola changed the validity of the results. They noted that all of the evidence samples were testable and that most of the DNA testing was done at the two consulting labs, not the LAPD crime lab where contamination supposedly happened. Since all of the samples the consulting labs received were testable, while Scheck and Neufeld's theory predicted that they should have been inconclusive after being \\"100% degraded\\", the claim that all the DNA was lost to bacterial degradation was not credible. The prosecution denied that contamination happened in the LAPD crime lab as well because the result would be a mixture of the \\"real killer(s)\\" DNA and Simpson's DNA but the results showed that only Simpson's DNA was present. The prosecution also noted the defense declined to challenge any of those results by testing the evidence themselves. Marcia Clark called Scheck and Neufeld's claims a \\"smoke screen.\\" The contamination claim was made by microbiologist Dr. John Gerdes. He testified on August 2, 1995 that Forensic PCR DNA matching is not reliable and \\"The LAPD crime lab has a substantial contamination problem. It is chronic in the sense that it doesn't go away.\\" Gerdes testified that because of the LAPD's history of contamination, he would not consider any of the PCR DNA matches in this case reliable because the tests were carried out by the LAPD. He also claimed that the consulting labs’ PCR DNA matches were not reliable, as the evidence they tested went \\"through the LAPD\\" for packaging and shipping. Gerdes believed only three of the DNA matches to have been valid, which were the same three the defense alleged were planted by the police. During cross-examination, Dr. Gerdes admitted there was no evidence that cross-contamination had occurred and that he was only testifying to \\"what might have occurred and not what actually did occur\\". He accepted that the victims' blood was in the Bronco and Simpson's blood was at the crime scene and neither was due to contamination. He also conceded that nothing happened during \\"packaging and shipping\\" that would affect the validity of the results at the two consulting labs. The prosecution implied that Gerdes was not a credible witness: he had no forensic experience and had only testified for criminal defendants in the past and always said the DNA evidence against them was not reliable due to contamination. Clark also implied that it was not a coincidence that the three evidence items he initially said were valid were the same three the defense claimed were planted while the other 58 were all false positives and the 47 substrate controls, which are used to determine if contamination occurred, were all false negatives. Defense forensic DNA expert Dr. Henry Lee testified on August 24, 1995 and admitted that Gerdes's claim was \\"highly improbable\\". Barry Scheck's eight-day cross-examination of Dennis Fung was lauded in the media. However, Howard Coleman, president of Seattle- based forensic DNA laboratory GeneLex, criticized Scheck's cross-examination as \\"smoke and mirrors\\" and stated \\"Everything we get in the lab is contaminated to some degree. What contamination and degradation will lead you to is an inconclusive result. It doesn't lead you to a false positive.\\" Police conspiracy allegation Poster describing reasonable doubt theory proposed by the defense.The defense initially only claimed that three exhibits were planted by the police but eventually argued that virtually all of the blood evidence against Simpson was planted in a police conspiracy. They accused prison nurse Thano Peratis, criminalists Dennis Fung, Andrea Mazzola, and Colin Yamauchi, and Detectives Philip Vannatter and Mark Fuhrman, of participating in a plot to frame Simpson. In closing arguments, Cochran called Fuhrman and Vannatter \\"twins of deception\\" and told the jury to remember Vannatter as \\"the man who carried the blood\\" and Fuhrman as \\"the man who found the glove.\\" EDTA The only physical evidence offered by the defense that the police tried to frame Simpson was the allegation that two of the 108 DNA evidence samples tested in the case contained the preservative Ethylenediaminetetraacetic acid, or EDTA. Ironically, it was the prosecution who asked to have the samples tested for the preservative, not the defense. The defense alleged that the drop of blood on the back gate at the Bundy crime scene, which matched Simpson, and the blood found on a pair of socks in Simpson's bedroom, which matched Nicole Brown, were planted by the police. In order to support the claim, the defense pointed to the presence of EDTA, a preservative found in the purple-topped collection tubes used for police reference vials, in the samples. On July 24, 1995, Dr. Fredric Rieders, a forensic toxicologist who had analysed results provided by FBI special agent Roger Martz, testified that the level of EDTA in the evidence samples was higher than that which is normally found in blood: this appeared to support the claim they came from the reference vials. During cross-examination, Clark asked Dr. Rieders to read out loud the portion of the EPA article that stated what the normal levels of EDTA in blood are, which he referenced during his testimony.http://simpson.walraven.org/jul24.html This demonstrated that he misread it and that the levels found in the evidence samples were consistent with those found in blood that was not preserved in a police reference vial. Dr. Rieders then claimed it was a \\"typo\\"https://www.google.com/books/edition/Blood_Evidence/Tc0ctKABrZwC?hl=en&gbpv;=1&bsq;=EPA%20report%20as%20either%20a%20typo%20https://www.sfgate.com/news/article/O-J- s-Lawyers-Call-Witness-to-Bolster-Theory-of-3027546.php but the prosecution produced a direct copy from the EPA disproving that claim.https://www.google.com/books/edition/Blood_Evidence/Tc0ctKABrZwC?hl=en&gbpv;=1&bsq;=A%20copy%20of%20an%20EPAhttps://www.chicagotribune.com/news/ct- xpm-1995-07-25-9507250145-story.html The prosecution also had Dr. Rieders admit that EDTA is also found in foodhttps://www.nytimes.com/1995/07/25/us/simpson-expert-supports-conspiracy- theory-defense.html and specifically the ingredients used in McDonald's Big Mac and French fries that Simpson had eaten earlier that night with Kato Kaelin. FBI special agent Roger Martz was called by the defense on July 25, 1995 to testify that EDTA was present in the evidence samples, yet instead said he did not identify EDTA in the blood, contradicting the testimony given by Dr. Rieders the day before. Initially, he conceded the blood samples \\"responded like EDTA responded\\" and \\"was consistent with the presence of EDTA\\" but clarified his response after hearing during the lunch break that \\"everyone is saying that I found EDTA, but I am not saying that\\". When the defense accused their own witness of changing his demeanor to favor the prosecution, he replied \\"I cannot be entirely truthful by only giving 'yes' and 'no' answers\\". Martz stated that it was impossible to ascertain with certainty the presence of EDTA, as while the presumptive test for EDTA was positive, the identification test for EDTA was inconclusive. Martz also tested his own unpreserved blood and got the same results for EDTA levels as the evidence samples, which he said conclusively disproved the claim the evidence blood came from the reference vials. He contended that the defense had jumped to conclusions from the presumptive test results, while his tests had in fact shown that \\"those bloodstains did not come from preserved blood\\". Back gate The defense alleged that Simpson's blood on the back gate at the Bundy crime scene was planted by the police. The blood on the back gate was collected on July 3, 1995, rather than June 13, the day after the murders. The volume of DNA on that blood was significantly higher than the other blood evidence collected on June 13. The volume of DNA was so high that the defense conceded that it could not be explained by contamination in the lab, yet noted that it was unusual for that blood to have more DNA on it than the other samples collected at the crime scene, especially since it had been left exposed to the elements for several weeks and after the crime scene had supposedly been washed over. On March 20, 1995 Detective Vannatter testified that he instructed Fung to collect the blood on the gate on June 13 and Fung admitted he had not done so.Simpson trial transcript . The defense suggested the reason why Fung did not collect the blood is because it was not there that day; Scheck showed a blown-up photograph taken of the back gate on June 13 and he admitted he could not see it in the photograph. The prosecution responded by showing that a different photograph showed that the blood was present on the back gate on June 13 and before the blood had been taken from Simpson's arm. Officer Robert Riske was the first officer to the crime scene and the one who pointed out the blood on the back gate to Fuhrman, who documented it in his notes that night. Multiple other officers also testified under oath that the blood was present on the back gate the night of the murders. The prosecution also pointed out that the media cameras present proved that Vannatter never returned to the Bundy crime scene (Nicole Brown's home) that evening, where Simpson's blood was allegedly planted.  Bronco  Barry Scheck alleged the police had twice planted the victims' blood inside Simpson's Bronco. An initial collection was made on June 13; the defense accused Vannatter of planting the victims' blood in the Bronco when he returned to Simpson's home later that evening. The prosecution responded that the Bronco had already been impounded by the time Vannatter returned and was not even at Rockingham. Socks The defense alleged that the police had planted Brown's blood on the socks found in Simpson's bedroom. The socks were collected on June 13 and had blood from both Simpson and Brown, but her blood on the socks was not identified until August 4. The socks were found by Detective Fuhrman, but the defense suggested Vannatter planted the blood. He had received both blood reference vials from the victims earlier that day from the coroner and booked them immediately into evidence. Vannatter then drove back to Rockingham later that evening to hand deliver the reference vial for Simpson to Fung, which the defense alleged gave him opportunity to plant the blood. Fung testified he could not see blood on the socks he collected from Simpson's bedroom but the prosecution later demonstrated that those blood stains are only visible underneath a microscope. Detective Vannatter denied planting Nicole Brown's blood on the socks. The video from Willie Ford indicated that the socks had already been collected and stored in the evidence van before Vannatter arrived and footage from the media cameras present appeared to prove that he never went inside the evidence van when he arrived at Rockingham. Glove Mark Fuhrman in 2008 The last exhibit allegedly planted was the bloody glove found at Simpson's property by Detective Mark Fuhrman. Unlike the sock and the back gate, the defense provided no physical or eyewitness evidence to support their claim that the prosecution could then refute. Jeffrey Toobin published an article in The New Yorker months before the trial began, which cited a source in Simpson's defense team that they intended to accuse Mark Fuhrman of planting the glove with the motive being racism. Robert Shapiro later admitted he was Toobin's source. Defense attorney F. Lee Bailey suggested that Fuhrman found the glove at the crime scene, picked it up with a stick and placed it in a plastic bag, and then concealed it in his sock when he drove to Simpson's home with Detectives Lange, Vannatter and Philips. Bailey suggested that he then planted the glove in order to frame Simpson, with the motive either being racism or a desire to become the hero in a high-profile case. Scheck also suggested that Fuhrman broke into Simpson's Bronco and used the glove like a paint brush to plant blood onto and inside the Bronco. The prosecution denied that Fuhrman planted the glove. They noted that several officers had already combed over the crime scene for almost two hours before Fuhrman arrived and none had noticed a second glove at the scene. Detective Lange testified that 14 other officers were there when Fuhrman arrived and all said there was only one glove at the crime scene. Lt. Frank Spangler also testified that he was with Fuhrman for the duration of his time there and stated he would have seen Fuhrman purloin the glove if he had in fact done so. Clark added that Fuhrman did not know whether Simpson had an alibi, if there were any witnesses to the murders, whose blood was on the glove, that the Bronco belonged to Simpson, or whether Kaelin had already searched the area where the glove was found. During cross- examination by Bailey, Fuhrman denied that he had used the word \\"nigger\\" to describe African Americans in the ten years prior to his testimony. A few months later, the defense discovered audiotapes of Fuhrman repeatedly using the word – 41 times in total, eight years before the murders. The tapes were made between 1985 and 1994 by screenwriter named Laura Hart McKinny, who had interviewed Fuhrman at length for a Hollywood screenplay she was writing on women police officers. The Fuhrman tapes became the cornerstone of the defense's case that Fuhrman's testimony lacked credibility. Clark called the tapes \\"the biggest red herring there ever was.\\" After McKinny was forced to hand over the tapes to the defense, Fuhrman says he asked the prosecution for a redirect to explain the context of those tapes but the prosecution and his fellow police officers abandoned him after Ito played the audiotapes in open court for the public to hear. The public reaction to the tapes was explosive and compared to the video of the Rodney King beating from a year prior. Fuhrman says he instantly became a pariah. After the trial, Fuhrman said that he was not a racist and apologized for his previous language, saying he was play-acting when he made the tapes, as he had been asked to be as dramatic as possible and was promised a $10,000 fee if the screenplay was produced. Many of his minority former coworkers expressed support for him. On September 6, 1995, Fuhrman was called back to the witness stand by the defense, after the prosecution refused to redirect him, to answer more questions. The jury was absent but the exchange was televised. Fuhrman, with his lawyer standing by his side and facing the possibility of being charged with Perjury, was instructed by his attorney to invoke the Fifth Amendment to avoid self- incrimination to two consecutive questions he was asked. Defense attorney Uelmen asked Fuhrman if it was his intention to plead the Fifth to all questions, and Fuhrman's attorney instructed him to reply \\"yes\\". Uelman then briefly spoke with the other members of the defense and said he had just one more question: \\"Did you plant or manufacture any evidence in this case?\\" Following his attorney's instruction, Fuhrman replied, \\"I choose to assert my Fifth Amendment privilege.\\" Cochran responded to Fuhrman's pleading the Fifth by accusing the other officers of being involved in a \\"cover-up\\" to protect Fuhrman and asked Judge Ito to suppress all of the evidence that Fuhrman found. Ito denied the request, stating that pleading the fifth does not imply guilt and there was no evidence of fraud. Cochran then asked that the jury be allowed to hear Fuhrman taking the fifth and again Ito denied his request. Ito also criticized the defense's theory of how Fuhrman allegedly planted the glove stating \\"it would strain logic to believe that\\". On June 15, 1995, Christopher Darden surprised Marcia Clark by asking Simpson to try on the gloves found at the crime scene and his home. The prosecution had earlier decided against asking Simpson to try them on because they had been soaked in blood from Simpson, Brown and Goldman, and frozen and unfrozen several times. Instead they presented a witness who testified that Nicole Brown had purchased a pair of those gloves in the same size in 1990 at Bloomingdales for Simpson along with a receipt and a photo during the trial of Simpson earlier wearing the same type of gloves. The leather gloves appeared too tight for Simpson to put on easily, especially over the latex gloves he wore underneath. Clark claimed that Simpson was acting when he appeared to be struggling to put on the gloves, yet Cochran replied \\"I don't think he could act the size of his hands.\\" Darden then told Ito of his concerns that Simpson \\"has arthritis and we looked at the medication he takes and some of it is anti-inflammatory and we are told he has not taken the stuff for a day and it caused swelling in the joints and inflammation in his hands.\\" Cochran informed Ito the next day that Shawn Chapman contacted the Los Angeles County Jail doctor, who confirmed Simpson was taking his arthritis medication every day and that the jail's medical records verified this. Uelmen came up with, and Cochran repeated, a quip he used in his closing arguments: \\"If it doesn't fit, you must acquit\\". The prosecution stated they believed the gloves shrank from having been soaked in the blood of the victims. Richard Rubin, former vice president of glove maker Aris Isotoner Inc. which makes the gloves in question, testified on September 12, 1995 that the gloves had indeed shrunk from their original size. He stated \\"the gloves in the original condition would easily go onto the hand of someone of Mr. Simpson's size.\\" Darden then produced a new pair of the same type of gloves, which fitted Simpson when he tried them on. After the trial, Cochran revealed that Bailey had goaded Darden into asking Simpson to try on the gloves and that Shapiro had told Simpson in advance how to give the appearance that they did not fit. On September 8, 2012, Darden accused Cochran of tampering with the glove before the trial. Dershowitz, a member of the Simpson defense team, refuted the claim, stating \\"the defense doesn't get access to evidence except under controlled circumstances.\\" Summation In closing arguments, Darden ridiculed the notion that police officers might have wanted to frame Simpson. He questioned why, if the LAPD was against Simpson, they went to his house eight times on domestic violence calls against Brown between 1986 and 1988 but did not arrest him; they only arrested him on charges of abuse in January 1989, when photos of Brown's face were entered into the record. Darden noted the police did not arrest Simpson for five days after the 1994 murders. The prosecution told the jury in closing arguments that Fuhrman was a racist, but said that this should not detract from the factual evidence that showed Simpson's guilt. Clark put emphasis on the physical evidence such as the DNA, the bronco and Simpson's lack of an alibi, while Darden referred to Simpson's relationship with Nicole as a \\"ticking time bomb\\" and spoke about how the police had refused to arrest Simpson until Nicole's death despite his physical abuse, stalking and death threats, and Nicole filling a safety deposit box with a will and photographs of previous beatings in case Simpson murdered her. In Cochran's summation to the jury, he was unable to refute any of the prosecution's claims, and instead emphasized that Fuhrman was proved to have repeatedly referred to black people as \\"niggers\\" and also to have boasted of beating young black men in his role as a police officer. Cochran compared Fuhrman to Adolf Hitler and referred to him as \\"a genocidal racist, a perjurer, America's worst nightmare and the personification of evil\\", and claimed without proof that Fuhrman had single- handedly planted all of the evidence, including the gloves, in an attempt to frame Simpson for the murders based purely on his dislike of interracial couples. In response, Fred Goldman, who was himself Jewish, referred to Cochran himself as \\"the worst kind of racist ever\\" and a \\"sick man\\" for making such a comparison, while Robert Shapiro, also Jewish, expressed that he was particularly offended by Cochran comparing Fuhrman's claims to the Holocaust, claiming that no comparison would ever be possible. =Verdict= Fears grew that race riots, similar to the riots in 1992, would erupt across Los Angeles and the rest of the country if Simpson were convicted of the murders. As a result, all Los Angeles police officers were put on 12-hour shifts. The police arranged for more than 100 police officers on horseback to surround the Los Angeles County courthouse on the day the verdict was announced, in case of rioting by the crowd. President Bill Clinton was briefed on security measures if rioting occurred nationwide. The only testimony the jury reviewed was that of limo driver Park. At 10:07 a.m. on Tuesday, October 3, 1995, Simpson was acquitted on both counts of murder. The jury arrived at the verdict by 3:00 p.m. on October 2, after four hours of deliberation, but Ito postponed the announcement. After the verdict was read, juror number nine, 44-year-old Lionel Cryer, gave Simpson a black power raised fist salute. The New York Times reported that Cryer was a former member of the revolutionary nationalist Black Panther Party that prosecutors had \\"inexplicably left on the panel\\". An estimated 100 million people worldwide watched or listened to the verdict announcement. Long-distance telephone call volume declined by 58%, and trading volume on the New York Stock Exchange decreased by 41%. Water usage decreased as people avoided using bathrooms. So much work stopped that the verdict cost an estimated $480 million in lost productivity. The U.S. Supreme Court received a message on the verdict during oral arguments, with the justices quietly passing the note to each other while listening to the attorney's presentation. Congressmen canceled press conferences, with one telling reporters, \\"Not only would you not be here, but I wouldn't be here, either.\\" Reaction to the verdict After the verdict in favor of Simpson, most blacks surveyed said they believed justice had been served, with most claiming that Simpson had been framed and some even suggesting that Mark Fuhrman was the actual killer. Most whites (75%) disagreed with the verdict and believed that it was racially motivated. Discussion of the racial elements of the case continued long after the trial's end. An NBC poll taken in 2004 reported that, although 77% of 1,186 people sampled thought Simpson was guilty, only 27% of blacks in the sample believed so, compared to 87% of whites. In 2016, FiveThirtyEight reported that most black people now think Simpson committed the murders. According to a 2016 poll, 83% of white Americans and 57% of black Americans believe that Simpson committed the murders. Shapiro admitted the defense played the race card, from the bottom of the deck. On Sunday, February 12, 1995, a long motorcade traveled to Brentwood and the jurors, prosecutors, defense lawyers, and Judge Ito made a two-hour inspection of the crime scene. It was followed by a three-hour tour of Simpson's estate. Simpson was under guard by several officers but did not wear handcuffs; he waited outside the crime scene in and around an unmarked police car and was permitted to enter his house. Simpson's defense team had switched out his photos of whites for blacks, including switching a picture of a nude Paula Barbieri (Simpson's girlfriend at the time, who was white) for a Norman Rockwell painting from Cochran's office. Prosecutors had requested that Ito restrict the tour to only the crime scene for this exact reason, but Ito refused, and came under heavy criticism for allowing the defense to control the trial. Critics of the jury's not-guilty verdict contended that the deliberation time was unduly short relative to the length of the trial. Some said that the jurors, most of whom did not have any college education, did not understand the forensic evidence. In post-trial interviews, several jurors said that they believed Simpson probably did commit the murders, but that the prosecution had failed to prove the case beyond a reasonable doubt. Three jurors together wrote and published a book called Madam Foreman, in which they described how their perception of police errors, not race, led to their verdict. They said that they considered Darden to be a token black assigned to the case by the prosecutor's office. In Ezra Edelman's 2016 documentary O.J.: Made in America, juror number six, Carrie Bess, voiced her own personal dislike for Nicole for apparently \\"allowing\\" herself to be abused, and said she believed \\"90% of the jury\\" actually decided to acquit Simpson as payback for the Rodney King incident, not because they believed in his innocence, and when asked if she believed the decision was correct, Bess merely shrugged indifferently, but later admitted that she regretted her decision after Simpson's arrest in Las Vegas. Juror number nine, Lionel Cryer, a former member of the Black Panther Party and who notably gave Simpson a black fist salute after the verdict, said that in retrospect, however, he would render a guilty verdict. =Books= In 1996, Cochran wrote and published a book about the trial. It was titled Journey to Justice, and described his involvement in the case. That same year, Shapiro also published a book about the trial called The Search for Justice. He criticized Bailey as a \\"loose cannon\\" and Cochran for bringing race into the trial. In contrast to Cochran's book, Shapiro said that he does not believe that Simpson was framed by the LAPD, but considered the verdict correct due to reasonable doubt. In a subsequent interview with Barbara Walters, Shapiro, who is Jewish, claimed that he was particularly offended by Cochran for comparing Fuhrman's words to the Holocaust, and vowed that he would never again work with Bailey or Cochran, but would still maintain a working relationship with Scheck. Clark published a book about the case titled Without a Doubt (1998). Her book recounts the trial proceedings, from jury selection to final summation. She concluded that nothing could have saved her case, given the defense's strategy of highlighting racial issues related to Simpson and the LAPD, and the predominance of blacks on the jury. In Clark's opinion, the prosecution's factual evidence, particularly the DNA, should have easily convicted Simpson. That it did not, she says, attests to a judicial system compromised by issues of race and celebrity. Darden published a book about the case called In Contempt (1998). In it he criticizes Ito as a \\"starstruck\\" judge who allowed the trial to turn into a media circus and the defense to control the court room while he collected hourglasses from fans and invited celebrities into his chambers. He also describes his frustration with a \\"dysfunctional and uneducated jury\\" that dismissed Simpson's history of domestic violence as irrelevant and inability to comprehend the DNA evidence in the case. Darden also describes his initial contact with Fuhrman and his suspicions that he is a racist and his feelings that the prosecution had been \\"kidnapped by a racist cop\\" whom they were unable to divorce themselves from. It also details the candid factors behind Darden's controversial decision for Simpson to try on the infamous glove and the impact it had on the trial's outcome. In 1996, former Los Angeles County Deputy District Attorney Vincent Bugliosi wrote a book titled Outrage: The Five Reasons Why O. J. Simpson Got Away with Murder. Bugliosi was very critical of Clark and Darden, faulting them, among other reasons, for not introducing the note that Simpson had written before trying to flee. He contended that the note \\"reeked\\" of guilt and that the jury should have been allowed to see it. He also noted that the jury was never informed about items found in the Bronco. The prosecution said that they felt these items of evidence would bring up emotional issues on Simpson's part that could harm their case, despite the fact that the items seemed as though they could be used for fleeing. He also criticized them for not wanting the jury to see or hear Simpson denying guilt, when there would not be a trial had Simpson not entered a not guilty plea. Bugliosi also said the prosecutors should have gone into more detail about Simpson's domestic abuse and presented evidence contrary to the defense's assertion that Simpson was a leader in the black community. Bugliosi also criticized the prosecution for trying the murder in Los Angeles, rather than Santa Monica, and described the prosecution's closing statements as inadequate. During the jury selection process, the defense made it difficult for the prosecution to challenge potential black jurors, on the grounds that it is illegal to dismiss someone from the jury for racially motivated reasons. (California courts barred peremptory challenges to jurors based on race in People v. Wheeler,22 Cal. 3d 258, 583 P. 2d 748 (1978) years before the U.S. Supreme Court would do so in Batson v. Kentucky.)476 U.S. 79 (1986) Defense forensic DNA expert Dr. Henry Lee published Blood Evidence: How DNA Is Revolutionizing The Way We Solve Crimes (2003). He devotes the last two chapters to explaining the arguments of Scheck and Neufeld against the DNA evidence in the Simpson case. Lee notes that Scheck and Neufeld were skeptics of DNA evidence and only recently before the trial, in 1992, accepted its validity and founded the Innocence Project. Lee writes that neither of the defense's forensic DNA experts, Dr. Henry Lee or Dr. Edward Blake, considered Scheck and Neufeld's reasonable doubt theory about the blood evidence plausible. In hindsight, Dr. Lee opines that Scheck and Neufeld's claim that \\"the blood evidence is only as good as the people collecting it\\" was an obfuscation tactic to conflate the validity of the evidence with the integrity of the LAPD and then attack the latter because both Scheck and Neufeld knew that the defense's forensic DNA experts reached the same conclusion as the prosecution: the mistakes made during evidence collection did not render the results unreliable. Lee opines that the jury did not understand the significance and precision of the DNA evidence. He bases this on comments from jurors after the trial, some of which included claims that the blood at the crime scene that matched Simpson had \\"degraded\\" and could possibly have been from Simpson's children or from one of the officials who collected the evidence. He attributes this misinterpretation to Scheck and Neufeld's deliberate obfuscation and deception about the reliability of the results. After the trial, the jurors faced harsh criticism for doubting the DNA evidence while Scheck and Neufeld received praise. Lee believes that the scathing criticism the jurors faced for doubting the DNA evidence based on the arguments Scheck and Neufeld made might have been the reason why they were the only two DNA experts from the criminal trial to decline to return for the subsequent civil trial to make those claims again. Media coverage The murders and trial – \\"the biggest story I have ever seen\\", said a producer of NBC's Today – received extensive media coverage from the very beginning; at least one instant book was proposed two hours after the bodies were found, and scheduled to publish only a few weeks later. The case was a seminal event in the history of reality television. The Los Angeles Times covered the case on its front page for more than 300 days after the murders. The nightly news broadcasts from the Big Three television networks gave more air time to the case than to the Bosnian War and the Oklahoma City bombing combined. The media outlets served an enthusiastic audience; one company put the loss of national productivity from employees following the case instead of working at $40 billion. The Tonight Show with Jay Leno aired many skits on the trial, and the Dancing Itos – a troupe of dancers dressed as the judge – was a popular recurring segment. According to Howard Kurtz of the Washington Post, the acquittal was \\"the most dramatic courtroom verdict in the history of Western civilization\\". Participants in the case received much media coverage. Limo driver Park said the media offered him $100,000 but refused, as he would be removed as a witness. Fans approached Clark at restaurants and malls, and when she got a new hairstyle during the trial, the prosecutor received a standing ovation on the courthouse steps; People approved of the change, but advised her to wear \\"more fitted suits and tailored skirts\\". While Cochran, Bailey and Dershowitz were already well-known, others like Kaelin became celebrities, and Resnick and Simpson's girlfriend Paula Barbieri appeared in Playboy. Those involved in the trial followed their own media coverage; when Larry King appeared in the courtroom after a meeting with Ito, both Simpson and Clark praised King's talk show. Interest in the case was worldwide; Russian president Boris Yeltsin's first question to President Clinton when they met in 1995 was, \\"Do you think O.J. did it?\\" The issue of whether to allow any video cameras into the courtroom was among the first issues Judge Ito had to decide, ultimately ruling that live camera coverage was warranted.FRONTLINE: the o.j. verdict: interviews: Peter arenella. PBS. Retrieved December 30, 2010. Ito was later criticized for this decision by other legal professionals. Dershowitz said that he believed that Ito, along with others related to the case such as Clark, Fuhrman and Kaelin, was influenced to some degree by the media presence and related publicity. The trial was covered in 2,237 news segments from 1994 through 1997. Ito was also criticized for allowing the trial to become a media circus and not doing enough to regulate the court proceedings. Among the reporters who covered the trial daily from the courtroom, and a media area that was dubbed \\"Camp O.J.\\", were Steve Futterman of CBS News, Linda Deutsch and Michael Fleeman of the Associated Press, Dan Whitcomb of Reuters, Janet Gilmore of the Los Angeles Daily News, Andrea Ford of the Los Angeles Times, Michelle Caruso of the New York Daily News, Dan Abrams of Court TV, Harvey Levin of KCBS and David Margolick of The New York Times. Writers Dominick Dunne, Joe McGinniss and Joseph Bosco also had full-time seats in the courtroom. Simpson on the cover of Newsweek and Time. Time darkened the image, leading to controversy. On June 27, 1994, Time published a cover story, \\"An American Tragedy\\", with a photo of Simpson on the cover. The image was darker than a typical magazine image, and the Time photo was darker than the original, as shown on a Newsweek cover released at the same time. Time became the subject of a media scandal. Commentators found that its staff had used photo manipulation to darken the photo, and speculated it was to make Simpson appear more menacing. After the publication of the photo drew widespread criticism of racist editorializing and yellow journalism, Time publicly apologized.O.J.'s Darkened Mug Shot. Museumofhoaxes.com. Retrieved December 30, 2010. Charles Ogletree, a former criminal defense attorney and current professor at Harvard Law School, said in a 2005 interview for PBS' Frontline that the best investigative reporting around the events and facts of the murder, and the evidence of the trial, was by the National Enquirer. Aftermath Despite Simpson's acquittal of the two murder charges, Police Chief Willie Williams indicated that he had no plans to reopen the investigation, saying of the acquittals, \\"It doesn't mean there's another murderer.\\" As of April 2001, Los Angeles Police Department homicide Detective Vic Pietrantoni was assigned to the Simpson-Goldman case. In the February 1998 issue of Esquire, Simpson was quoted as saying, \\"Let's say I committed this crime...even if I did this, it would have to have been because I loved her very much, right?\\" In April 1998, Simpson did an interview with talk show host Ruby Wax. In an apparent joke, Simpson showed up at her hotel room claiming to have a surprise for her, and suddenly waved a banana about his head, as if it were a knife, and pretended to stab Wax with it. The footage soon made its way onto US television networks, causing outrage. =Civil trial= In 1996, Fred Goldman and Sharon Rufo, the parents of Ron Goldman, filed a suit against Simpson for wrongful death, while Brown's estate, represented by her father Lou Brown, brought suit against Simpson in a \\"survivor suit.\\" The trial took place over four months in Santa Monica and, by judge's order, was not televised. The Goldman family was represented by Daniel Petrocelli, with Simpson represented by Bob Baker. Attorneys for both sides were given high marks by observing lawyers. Simpson's defense in the trial was estimated to cost $1 million and was paid for by an insurance policy on his company, Orenthal Enterprises. Fuhrman was not called to testify, and Simpson was subpoenaed to testify on his own behalf. A photo published in the National Enquirer in 1993 of Simpson wearing Bruno Magli shoes was presented at the civil trial. Simpson denied owning those shoes and said the photo was doctored like his mugshot on the cover of Time magazine, but E.J. Flammer, the photographer who produced the originals, disproved that claim. Other pre-1994 photos of Simpson wearing Bruno Magli shoes were discovered as well. The jury in the trial awarded Brown and Simpson's children, Sydney and Justin (Brown's only children), $12.6 million from their father as recipients of their mother's estate. The victims' families were awarded $33.5 million in compensatory and punitive damages, thereby finding Simpson \\"responsible\\" for the respective murders. In 2008, a Los Angeles superior court approved the plaintiffs' renewal application on the court judgment against Simpson. Four years after the trial, at an auction to pay some of the money in the compensation order, Bob Enyart, a conservative Christian radio host, paid $16,000 for some of Simpson's memorabilia, including his Hall of Fame induction certificate, two jerseys, and two trophies he was given for charity work. Enyart took the items outside the courthouse where the auction was held, burned the certificate and jerseys, and smashed the trophies with a sledgehammer. =If I Did It= In November 2006, ReganBooks announced a book ghostwritten by Pablo Fenjves based on interviews with Simpson titled If I Did It, an account which the publisher said was a hypothetical confession. The book's release was planned to coincide with a Fox special featuring Simpson. \\"This is a historic case, and I consider this his confession,\\" publisher Judith Regan told the Associated Press.Publisher Calls Book O.J.'s 'Confession', AP, November 15, 2006 On November 20, News Corporation, parent company of ReganBooks and Fox, canceled both the book and the TV interview due to a high level of public criticism. CEO Rupert Murdoch, speaking at a press conference, stated: \\"I and senior management agree with the American public that this was an ill-considered project.\\" Later, the Goldman family was awarded rights to the book to satisfy part of the judgment against Simpson. The title of the book was changed to If I Did It: Confessions of the Killer. On the front cover of the book, the title was stylized with the word \\"If\\" to appear much smaller than those of \\"I Did It\\", and placed inside the \\"I\\", so unless looked at very closely, the title of the book reads \\"I Did It: Confessions of the Killer\\". The Goldmans came under criticism for allowing the book to be released, particularly by the Brown family. On March 11, 2018, Fox broadcast Simpson's previously unaired interview with Regan, which was part of the book deal in a special titled O.J. Simpson: The Lost Confession? In the decade-old interview, which was supposed to air with the release of the book by ReganBooks, Simpson gave a very detailed hypothesis on how the murders would have been committed if he had been involved, initially using phrases like \\"I would\\" and \\"I'd think\\", but later moving to using first person phrasing with sentences like \\"I remember I grabbed the knife\\", \\"I don't remember except I'm standing there\\", \\"I don't recall\\", and \\"I must have\\", and involving a supposed accomplice named \\"Charlie\\". Due to the change in phrasing, these comments were interpreted by many as being a form of confession, which stirred strong reactions in print media and the internet. =Later developments= As a result of a 2007 incident in Las Vegas, Nevada regarding an attempt to steal materials Simpson claimed were stolen from him, Simpson was convicted in 2008 of multiple felonies including use of a deadly weapon to commit kidnapping, burglary and armed robbery, and sentenced to a minimum nine years to a maximum 33 years in prison. His attempts to appeal the sentence were unsuccessful and he was detained at Lovelock Correctional Center in Lovelock, Nevada. During his 2013 parole hearing, Simpson was granted parole on all counts except weapons-related and the two counts of assault with a deadly weapon. After a July 20, 2017 Nevada parole board hearing voting unanimously 4–0, Simpson was granted parole after a minimum nine-year sentence on the remaining counts for the Vegas robbery with Sunday, October 1, 2017 to be his release date from prison on parole. According to Nevada law, if he continues his good behavior, Simpson will have his 33-year sentence reduced by 50% to make September 29, 2022 the end of his sentence. Upon release, Simpson intends to reside near his family in Miami, Florida, where he moved in 2000. Florida is one of the few U.S. states that protects one's home and pensions from seizures for such debts as those awarded following the civil trial. Goldman's father and sister, Fred and Kim, did not appear before the board, but stated that they had received about 1% of the $33.5 million that Simpson owes from the wrongful death suit. Simpson has participated in two high- profile interviews regarding the case – one in 1996 with Ross Becker, which outlines Simpson's side of the story, as well as a guided tour of his estate, where evidence used in the trial was found. The second took place in 2004, on the tenth anniversary of the murders, with Katie Couric for NBC speaking to Simpson. He had worked for that network as a sports commentator. In May 2008, Mike Gilbert, a former agent and friend of Simpson, released his book How I Helped O.J. Get Away with Murder, which details Simpson confessing to the killings to Gilbert. Gilbert states that Simpson had smoked marijuana and taken a sleeping pill and was drinking beer when he confided at his Brentwood home weeks after his trial what happened the night of the murders. Simpson said, \\"If she hadn't opened that door with a knife in her hand... she'd still be alive.\\" This, Gilbert said, confirmed his belief that Simpson had confessed.\\"O.J.: Made in America\\", Episode 5 In March 2016, the LAPD announced a knife had been found in 1998 buried at Simpson's estate, when the buildings were razed. A construction worker had given the knife to a police officer, who, believing the case had been closed, did not submit it as evidence at the time. Forensic tests demonstrated that the knife was not related to the murder. The presence of Kardashian on Simpson's legal team, combined with the press coverage of the trial, was the catalyst for the ongoing popularity of the Kardashian family. While Kardashian's ex-wife Kris Jenner was already married to former Olympic gold medalist Bruce Jenner (now Caitlyn Jenner) at the time of the trial, Kardashian's family was mostly out of the public eye before the trial, only becoming famous due to the trial. Other theories The murders continue to be the subject of research and speculation. For example, Detective William Dear conducted a lengthy investigation. His evidence and conclusions, among those of other experts (e.g., Dr. Henry Lee) who have reviewed the crime, trial, and evidence, were addressed in the BBC documentary O.J.: The True Untold Story (2000). The documentary, produced by Malcolm Brinkworth, claims that the police and prosecution had contaminated or planted evidence pointing to Simpson as the killer, and ignored exculpatory evidence. Furthermore, it asserts that the state too hastily eliminated other possible suspects, including Simpson's elder son Jason, and individuals linked to the illegal drug trade, in which Brown, Goldman and Resnick allegedly participated. Alternative theories of the murders, supposedly shared by Simpson, have suggested they were related to the Los Angeles drug trade, and that Michael Nigg, a friend and co-worker of Goldman, was murdered as well. Simpson himself has stated in numerous interviews that he believes the two had been killed over their involvement in drug dealing in the area, and that other murders at the time were carried out for the same reason. Brown, Simpson believed, had been planning to open a restaurant using proceeds from cocaine sales. Mezzaluna was reportedly a nexus for drug trafficking in Brentwood. Brett Cantor, part-owner of the Dragonfly nightclub in Hollywood, was found stabbed to death in his nearby home on July 30, 1993; no suspects have ever been identified. The case gained renewed attention a year later when Simpson's defense team successfully petitioned the court trying him for the murders of Brown and Goldman for access to the case file, on the grounds that the way in which all three were stabbed suggested the same killer. Since Goldman had worked for Cantor as a waiter, and Nicole was a regular at Dragonfly, some books about the case have raised the possibility that the three killings may also have resulted from involvement in drug trafficking. Michael Nigg, an aspiring actor and waiter at a Los Angeles restaurant, was shot and killed during an attempted robbery on September 8, 1995, while withdrawing money from an ATM. Three suspects were arrested a month later but released due to a lack of evidence and the case remains unsolved. Since Nigg was a friend of Ronald Goldman, with whom he had worked, and seemed to live quite well for someone in his position, some reports have suggested that he was involved in drug trafficking. Nigg's murder has been used to support theories that the murders of Goldman and O.J. Simpson's ex-wife Nicole the year before were drug-related as well. In 2012, several links between the killings and convicted murderer Glen Edward Rogers were alleged in the documentary film My Brother the Serial Killer, which was broadcast on Investigation Discovery (ID). Clay Rogers, Glen's brother, recounts Glen saying how he had met Brown and was \\"going to take her down\\" a few days before the murders happened in 1994. When the murder case was under process, Van Nuys ADA Lea D'Argostino came to know about a written statement from Glen revealing he had met Brown. The information was forwarded to Simpson's prosecutors, but was ignored. Much later, in his years- long correspondence with criminal profiler Anthony Meolis, Glen also wrote about and created paintings pointing towards his involvement with the murders. During a personal prison meeting between the two, Glen said he was hired by Simpson to break into Brown's house and steal some expensive jewelry, and that Simpson had told him: \\"you may have to kill the bitch\\". In a filmed interview, Glen's brother Clay asserts that his brother confessed his involvement. Rogers' family stated that he had informed them that he had been working for Nicole in 1994 and that he had made verbal threats about her to them. Rogers would later speak to a criminal profiler about the Goldman–Simpson murders, providing details about the crime and remarking that he had been hired by O. J. Simpson to steal a pair of earrings and potentially murder Nicole. Best selling author and journalist Stephen Singular was approached about the O.J. Simpson case from an anonymous source within the LAPD. Singular acquired the attention of this source through his book Talked to Death: The Life and Murder of Alan Berg, a Jewish radio talk show host who was murdered by a white supremacist, Neo-Nazi group called The Order. According to the source, Mark Fuhrman used a broken piece of fence to pick up one of the bloody gloves found at the Bundy crime scene and place it in a blue evidence bag. Afterwards, Fuhrman and another detective made an undocumented trip to OJ Simpson's Rockingham estate in the early morning, where Fuhrman removed the glove from the plastic bag and placed it in an alley to the side of the Rockingham estate. A blue plastic bag was later recovered from the Rockingham estate and a broken piece of fence was recovered from the Bundy crime scene, both were entered into evidence. Singular was also told by the source that Fuhrman had some sort of relationship with Nicole Brown Simpson, and an internal affairs investigation conducted by the LAPD later revealed Fuhrman was overheard bragging to other officers about being intimate with Brown and describing her breast augmentation. The source also revealed that Ethylenediaminetetraacetic acid (EDTA) would be found in some of the blood evidence if tested and that lab technicians had mishandled Simpson's blood samples. Singular relayed all of this information to the defense team and was in communication with them for a couple of months. He went on to write and publish a book detailing his experience, Legacy of Deception: An Investigation of Mark Fuhrman and Racism in the LAPD. =Reaction from individuals involved= Such theories have been refuted by Clark, Brown's sister Tanya, and Fred Goldman who said, \\"I believe [O.J.] did it, and he did it alone.\\" The families of Brown and Goldman expressed anger at the premise of My Brother the Serial Killer, with both families dismissing the claims by the Rogers family. Kim Goldman accused ID of irresponsibility, stating that no one had informed her of Glen Rogers' claims that he had been involved in her brother's death. ID's president, Henry Schlieff, replied that the documentary's intention was not to prove Rogers had committed the crimes, but to \\"give viewers new facts and let them make up their own minds\\", and that he believed Simpson was guilty of the murders. Schlieff also commented that the movie did not point out any inconsistencies with the claims or evidence against Rogers because \\"ID viewers are savvy enough to root them out on their own\\". According to O.J.: Made in America director Ezra Edelman, no plausible alternative theory has emerged. In popular culture =Media adaptations= * In 1995, Fox premiered the television movie The O. J.

History Before Northern Star, there was Northam Star. It is believed Peterborough Northern Star has its roots in Eye village football, where the team played in the Peterborough and District Football League under three different names in four spells from 1905 to 1930, with a couple of breaks. Including one for the First World War. In 1931, Northam Star Sports Club was born, taking over from Eye United and combining works teams from the Northam and Dogsthorpe Star brick works. The team’s debut season in a reorganised Peterborough and District Football League saw them taking part in the new Division Three North and they opened their campaign with a 5-2 defeat away to Paston Athletic Reserves. Their first season saw Northam Star finish a respectable sixth in a league of ten teams. Northam Star had a long history in the PDFL, winning Division Three North twice, before the team disbanded and a change of name became necessary in 1959. The new club, under the name Eye United, was a dominant force in the PDFL, winning ten league titles between 1960 and 2003 which included a hat- trick of Premier Division titles at the turn of the 1980s. In the 2000/01 season, Eye United won all thirty league games and romped to the title by sixteen points. From 1973 to 2003, Eye United won five Senior Cups, which included another hat-trick from 2000/01 to 2002/03 and they also won the Jack Hogg Shield four times in a row from 2000 to 2003. It was time to move on and they took their place in the United Counties League Division One in 2003/04, moving from Lindisfarne Road to their current base in Dogsthorpe. After two seasons in UCL Division One, in which the team finished third and fourth, a decision was made to change name as there was some confusion caused by the move out of Eye, whilst retaining the Eye United name. Rather than change back to Northam Star, which would have kept the Eye connection alive, the club debuted as Peterborough Northern Star in 2005/06, finishing ninth. It did not take long for success to come to Chestnut Avenue, and Star won the UCL Div One in 2008/09. A second placed finish the following season was enough to see the club promoted to the Premier Division and the club won its first Hinchingbrooke Cup that year. In the UCL Premier Division, the club finished its debut season in a creditable ninth place and a couple of years later had a remarkable run to the quarter finals of the FA Vase, where it took eventual winners Dunston to stop Star with a 4-3 win in a thrilling match in front of over 600 spectators. Following the departure of manager Chris Plummer that team broke up, and the seasons since 2012 have seen frequent changes of manager and playing staff, which has led to an unsettled period for the club. Despite this, success continued to be achieved at all levels from juniors to youths and reserves in 2014/15, the Star first team secured its second Hinchingbrooke Cup with a victory over Deeping Rangers and reached the final again the following year, where we were defeated by Peterborough Sports. For the 2016/17 season, we welcomed Raff Mazzarella back to the club as first team manager, following a previous spell in charge of the club’s reserve side, which saw his team finish runners up in the league and win the Reserve KO Cup. A difficult campaign in many ways saw an improved league position of 15th on the previous year and in context can be regarded as successful. The 2017/18 season saw the club enter an exciting new period, with several changes on and off the field. Raff stepped down as first team manager and moved upstairs to become the club’s director of football, with a wide ranging brief. The new first team manager was Rob Ward who joined the club after two seasons at Ketton in the PDFL, where he was joint manager of last season’s Daniels Cup winning side, but on 19 November Rob Ward was relieved of his position.

It is famous for being the site of the tomb of Idris I, the first major Islamic ruler of Morocco, after whom the town is named. It is located near Meknes and overlooks the ruins of Volubilis a few kilometers away.  History  An outer courtyard of the Zawiya of Moulay Idris. Idris I (known as Moulay Idris) was a descendant of the Prophet Muhammad who fled from Abbasid-controlled territory after the Battle of Fakh because he had supported the defeated pro-Shi'a rebels. He established himself at Oualili (Volubilis), a formerly Roman town which by then was mostly inhabited by Berbers and a small population of Judeo-Christian heritage. He used his prestige as a descendant of the Prophet to forge an alliance with local Berber tribes (in particular the Awraba) in 789 and quickly became the most important religious and political leader in the region. As the old site of Roman Volubilis was located on an open plain and considered vulnerable, the settlement moved up a few kilometers towards the mountains, presumably around the site of the current town of Moulay Idriss, leaving the old Roman ruins abandoned. Idris I died soon after in 791, possibly poisoned on the order of the Abbasid caliph Harun al-Rashid, just before his son Idris (II) was born. Once Idris II came of age and officially took over his position as ruler in 803, he continued his father's endeavors and significantly expanded the authority of the new Idrisid state. As a result, the Idrisid dynasty was of central importance to the early Islamization of Morocco, forming the first true \\"Islamic\\" state to consolidate power over much of its territory. They also founded the important city of Fes, about 50 kilometres away, which became the Idrisid capital under Idris II.Stefan Goodwin, Africa's Legacies of Urbanization: Unfolding Saga of a Continent, 2006, Lexington Books, 514 pages. . The early history of Moulay Idriss Zerhoun (sometimes called simply Moulday Idriss) as a town is not widely discussed by historians. A mausoleum for Idris I presumably existed on this site, overlooking Volubilis/Oualili, since his death. The tomb was probably placed inside a qubba (general term for a domed building or structure), and the name Oualili was eventually replaced by the name Moulay Idriss. Some anti-Idrisid rulers in 10th-century Fes claimed that Idris II was also buried here (instead of in his alleged tomb in Fes itself), though he is widely believed to be buried in Fes, where his mausoleum and mosque is still a site of major importance today. Although the town became a site of pilgrimage early on, after Idris II it was quickly overshadowed by Fes, which became the most important city of the region. The popularity of Idris I and his son as Muslim \\"saints\\" and figures of national importance was not constant throughout Morocco's history, with their status declining significantly after the end of Idrisid influence in the 10th century. The Almoravids, the next major Moroccan dynasty after them, were hostile to the cult of saints and other practices judged less orthodox under their stricter views of Islam. It was only during the Marinid period, from the 14th century onward, that the Idrisid founders became celebrated again and that their religious importance redeveloped. An early sign of this was the alleged rediscovery of Idris I's remains in 1318, at Moulay Idris Zerhoun, which apparently caused something of a sensation among the local population and attracted attention from the Marinid authorities. During this time, the annual moussem (religious festival) in August, celebrating Moulay Idris I, was instituted and began to take shape. The mausoleum itself apparently remained little changed for many centuries. Under the sharifian dynasties of Morocco, the Saadians and (especially) the Alaouites, who also claimed descent from the Prophet Muhammad, the status of Idris I and II as foundational figures in Moroccan history was further elevated in order to enhance the new dynasties' own legitimacy. Moulay Ismail, the powerful and long-reigning Alaouite sultan between 1672 and 1727, ordered the existing mausoleum to be demolished and rebuilt on a grander scale. Adjoining properties were purchased for the purpose. Construction lasted from 1719 to 1721. Once finished, Moulay Ismail ordered that the khutba (Friday sermon) be performed regularly in the mausoleum's mosque, which established it as the main Friday mosque of the city. In 1822, the Alaouite sultan Moulay Abderrahman (Abd al-Rahman), purchased another property adjoining the mausoleum in order to rebuild the mosque on an even bigger and more lavish scale. Under Sultan Sidi Mohammed (Mohammed IV; ruled 1859-1873), some expert ceramic tilework decoration was added by the Meknesi artisan Ibn Makhlouf. Following Moroccan independence in 1956, the mausoleum was redecorated and the mosque expanded yet again by King Mohammed V and his son Hassan II. To this day, Idris's tomb is a pilgrimage site and the center of a popular moussem (religious festival) every August. The gold-embroidered covering over his tomb is replaced regularly every one or two years during its own ritual attended by religious and political figures. Due to its status as a holy city and sanctuary, the town was off-limits to non-Muslims until 1912, and non-Muslims were not able to stay overnight until 2005. Since 1995, Moulay Idriss Zerhoun has been on UNESCO's Tentative list of World Heritage Sites.  Geography  The town is currently in the Fès-Meknès region. From 1997 to 2015 it was in Meknès-Tafilalet. The ruins of the Berber and Roman city of Volubilis are located just five kilometers away. Idris I took many materials from here in order to build his town. Further away are the cities of Meknes (about 28 km away by road) and Fez (about 50 km away). The town is located on two adjacent foothills of the Zerhoun mountains, the Khiber and the Tasga, which form the town's two main districts. Between these is the mausoleum and religious complex of Moulay Idris. The Khiber is the taller of the two hills and its summit offers views over the religious complex and the rest of town. The Sentissi Mosque and the Mausoleum-mosque of Sidi Abdallah el Hajjam are also located near the top of the Khiber hill.  Notable sites and landmarks  The entrance to the zawiya. = Zawiya of Moulay Idris I = The zawiya (a religious complex including a mausoleum, mosque, and other amenities; also spelled zaouia) of Moulay Idris is located at the center of town, with its entrance just off the main town square. It is reached then reached via a long passage that leads to the main building. This includes the mausoleum chamber, recognizable from afar by its huge green-tiled pyramidal roof, and a mosque area. It also has a tall minaret with a square shaft, typical of Moroccan architecture. The decoration is rich and dates from the Alaouite period, including from the 20th century. The zawiya is off limits to non-Muslims. = Cylindrical Minaret = The Sentissi Mosque, built in 1939 by a local man after his return from the hajj in Mecca. It allegedly has the only cylindrical minaret in Morocco. The minaret is covered in a background of green tiles with white Kufic-style Arabic letters spelling out a surah from the Qur'an. The mosque is now a Qur'anic school (madrasa), and is also referred to as the Medersa Idriss.

It is located at the Tasermiut Fjord (), east of Nanortalik. Its population was 53 in 2020. In the Greenlandic language, the name of the settlement means \\"like a lake\\", referring to the lake-looking bay it situated on. The inhabitants call it \\"Tasiisaq\\", which is the local dialect. There are several sheep farms in the wider Tasiusaq area; the farms of Nalasut with 10 inhabitants, Saputit with 3 inhabitants, and Nuugaarsuk with four inhabitants. Until January, 2009, the settlement belonged to the Nanortalik municipality. On January 1, 2009, the settlement became part of the Kujalleq municipality, when the Narsaq, Qaqortoq, and Nanortalik municipalities ceased to exist as administrative entities.  Infrastructure and transportation  The settlement has a local school, a church, a general store, and a general repairs workshop maintained by the Kujalleq municipality. The school in the settlement--Malakip atuarfia—had 14 pupils in the year 2005/2006. Additionally, the school runs a camp at Nuugaarsuk by the Tasermiut Fjord.

Tasiusaq is not connected to any other place via roads. Fairly well trodden hiking trails lead north and west from the town, but for any motorized transportation terrain vehicles are needed.  Geography and climate  The settlement lies in a strait connecting the Disko Fjord with the Tasiusaq Bay. Due to its favourable location the area has a remarkably mild climate. The Saputit and Saputit Tasia sheep farms even have minor forms of agriculture. Further, the nature reserve of Qinngua Valley at nearby Tasersuaq Lake is considered the place with the only natural forest in Greenland; while the forest is only a few acres in size, the sub-arctic willow and birch trees that usually only reach a height of a few centimeters can reach a height of several meters in the valley.  Population  Most towns and settlements in southern Greenland exhibit negative growth patterns over the last two decades, with many settlements rapidly depopulating. The population of Tasiusaq has decreased by 14 percent relative to the 1990 levels, and over 6 percent relative to the 2000 levels.

The Tinghir region is wedged between two mountain ranges, stretching over southwest to northeast Morocco: the High Atlas in the north, with a high peak over , and the Little Atlas in the south. The road from Ouarzazate to Imtghren parallels the mountains. During the Mesozoic the region was invaded by the sea, where thick deposits of sediments rich in marine fossils (particularly of the ammonitida class). The uplift of the Atlas Mountains (primarily during the Neogene) caused the withdrawal of the sea and the deformation of rocks into folds and faults. Wind and river erosion eventually shaped the desert landscape of limestone and clay. The Todgha River has widened these layers of rock, giving rise to canyons high but in some places only wide. The river widens, developing an oasis edged with the red ochre of the desert. Government King Mohammed VI gave his approval on 21 January 2009 to make Tinghir an administrative center, an initiative which met the needs of its inhabitants; it provides a legal and institutional framework for reform of territorial administration based on good governance and local self- administration.

It is located approximately one mile south of the city centre. It was originally known as Eccles (i.e. 'church'), and may have been a Christian site from an unusually early date (possibly 5th or 6th century). Later called 'St. Ringan's' (a variant of St Ninian's). This church was the administrative centre for churches across the strath of the River Forth. Church A document dating from 1147 refers to \\"the church of Egglis St Ninians with its chapels of Dunipace and Lithbert\\". The famous fight between the forces of Sir Thomas Randolph, 1st Earl of Moray and Sir Robert de Clifford, 1st Baron de Clifford on the first day of the Battle of Bannockburn on 23 June, 1314 is generally placed at St. Ninian's Kirk. During the Siege of Stirling Castle, part of the 1745 Jacobite rising, the church was used to store munitions and this blew up when the Jacobites began retreating on 1 February 1746. Despite claims it was deliberate, it was more likely simply due to carelessness. Only the tower survived; it was later restored and can be seen to this day. A few years after the Church was rebuilt it became the scene of another drama. The local landowner 'presented' a new minister, Mr Thomson of Gargunnock. He was not chosen by the heads of families and a dispute arose. After years of wrangling the Presbytery was forced to appoint him. The Moderator of Presbytery addressed these words to him :\\"Sir, we are met here this day, by a former appointment of Presbytery, in obedience to the same sentence of the General Assembly, to admit you minister of St. Ninians- a sentence pronounced by the highest horn of ecclesiastical authority or power. That Assembly have assumed to themselves higher power than the Parliament-by some profanely styled omnipotent-that wise, that august body, never enacting any laws without consent of the people. There has been a formidable opposition made against you by six hundred heads of families, sixty heritors, and all the elders of the parish, I believe, except one. This opposition has continued for seven years by your own obstinacy, and if you should this day be admitted, you can have no pastoral relation to the souls of the parish; you will never be regarded as the shepherd to go before the sheep-they know you not, and they will never follow you; and, let me assure you, dear sir, if you persist in your obstinacy, you will do more harm in this parish than you could have done good in Gargunnock though you had been to live there for a hundred years; and you will draw misery and contempt upon yourself-you will be despised-you will be hated-you will be insulted and maltreated. One of the most eloquent and learned ministers of this Church told me lately that he would go twenty miles to see you deposed; and I do assure you, sir, that I, and twenty thousand more friends to our Church, would do the same. You maintained a good character and reputation till your unhappy And obstinate adherence to this presentation. Now, bending under the weight of years and infirmities of old age, what happiness can you propose to yourself in this mad, this desperate attempt of yours, without the concurrence of the people, and without the least prospect of usefulness in the parish. Your admission into it, therefore, can only be regarded as a sinecure, and you yourself as Stipend-Lifter of St. Ninians. Now, sir, I conjure you, by the mercies of God, give up this presentation. I conjure you, for the sake of the great number of souls in St. Ninians, and by that peace of mind which you would wish in a dying hour, and that awful and impartial account which in a little you must give to God of your own soul, and of the souls of this parish, at the tribunal of our Lord Jesus Christ, give it up.\\" He did not give up and so was inducted. Of the twenty-one elders of the parish, one remained loyal to the old Church; the others left its walls. They, along with the majority of the people, formed a Relief Church. Rev. Patrick Hutchison was the first minister of the Relief congregation, from 1774 to 1783. In the disruption of 1843 a Free Church of Scotland was formed. This congregation eventually returned to the Church of Scotland and became known as St George's. In 1969 it was dissolved and the building eventually demolished to make way for housing. The Relief congregation originally at the 'toll' continues today as St Ninians United Free Church of Scotland. In recent years, the old steeple, which was built in 1734 but houses a 17th-century bell, became structurally unsafe but has been restored, with funding from St. Ninians Old Parish Church, local community donations, and Historic Scotland. As it stands, this tower appears to be a late 17th- to early 18th-century structure, but is likely to be of much earlier origin (possibly 11th-12th century). In October 2017, one of the gateways and part of the wall to the Category A listed graveyard was demolished in a collision with a vehicle. Industry During the 19th century, St. Ninians' main industry was nail- making, with the main works located at the corner of Weaver Row and Main Street (known locally as Nailworks Corner). This site is now the location of a Lidl supermarket. Traffic diversion In the early 20th century, traffic was diverted away from the Main Street into Borestone Crescent and the Borestone Roundabout, which carries the main traffic from Glasgow, Edinburgh and Falkirk into Stirling. In the 1960s, most of this traffic was again diverted on to the Inner Relief Road from an enlarged Borestone Roundabout. Housing and shops The area is served by a strip of shops and take-aways and other amenities next to the busy Borestone Roundabout, known locally as \\"the toll\\". Housing in the area is predominantly council or ex-council, with a mixture of terraced houses and flats.

Summers are hot and very dry, while winters are extremely cold and snowy, especially at night. Marriage Festival The town of Imilchil represents a symbol of Berber culture, known for its festival, officially known as Betrothal Festival - the Souk Aam or Agdoud N'Oulmghenni. The legend goes that two young people from different tribes fell in love, but were forbidden to see each other by their families. The grief led them to cry themselves to death, creating the neighbouring lakes of Isli (his) and Tislit (hers) near Imilchil. The families decided to establish a day on the anniversary of the lovers' death - when members of local tribes could marry each other. Thus the Imilchil Marriage Festival was born. In reality, the region is a large scattering of tiny villages, and when young person needs to find a partner, they can't simply go and look for one, due to the conservative social norms. Thus, the festival allows for fathers to show their daughters and find husbands for them. When a woman accepts a man's proposal to marry, she says \\"You have captured my liver\\" (Tq massa n uchemt). Up to 40 couples take their vows on the same day. The festival is rich with music, dancing, feasts, and colorful clothing. The celebrations attracts many tourists to the area, and though contributing to local economy, there are fears that the rituals can be affected by the foreigners.

One of them, who had left the party to track down a wounded kangaroo over some low stony hills, picked up a pretty stone which appealed to him. When taking back the stone, they suspected it could be opal which the local jeweller confirmed. He advised to get as much opal as possible since this could be more profitable than kangaroo hunting.

APUS offers associates, bachelors, masters, and doctoral degrees, in addition to dual degrees, certificate programs and learning tracks. Despite its name, APUS is not a public institution and is not a part of the U.S. government or the U.S. military. In 2018, the school paid $270,000 to the state of Massachusetts following an investigation by the state's attorney general into allegations that it misled potential students. Approximately 56% of APUS students reported that they served in the military on active duty at initial enrollment. About 55,000 military service members get tuition assistance (TA) for APUS schools. Another 16,702 use their GI Bill benefits for the schools. History The university was founded in 1991 by Major James P. Etter (USMC, retired) as American Military University. Operations began in January 1993 with the enrollment of 18 graduate students. Initially, the main goal of the university was to meet the unique educational needs of military personnel needing courses in specialized areas, such as counterterrorism and military intelligence, that were not included in typical university course offerings. In the early years, instruction was done through conventional correspondence. In June 1995 AMU became nationally accredited by the Accrediting Commission of the Distance Education and Training Council (DETC). In January of the following year, the school introduced its first undergraduate programs. In 1998 AMU made the transition from correspondence-based learning to online learning. In 2002 AMU expanded to become American Public University System and established American Public University, intended primarily for civilians interested in public service programs. In 2006 APUS was granted regional accreditation from the Higher Learning Commission. In 2012 American Public University System resigned its DETC accreditation.

The club is currently a member of the and play at Victoria Mill, London Road. The club is managed by Simon Anderson. The team is named after milling business Whitworths and are nicknamed \\"the flourmen\\". History The club was established in 1973 after London Ideal Clothiers folded. At the time most Clothiers players were also playing for the Sunday league team Victoria Millers, and after discussing the idea with Dave Woodley, Whitworth FC was established.Club history Wellingborough Whitworth FC The new club started in Division One of the Rushden and District League. After winning the Division in 1975–76 and 1976–77, they moved up to the East Midlands Alliance. The club won the league's Munton Cup twice. On the second occasion, both the first team and the reserve teams reached the final, with the reserve team winning 6–1. The following season reserve teams were banned from entering the cup. After making several improvements to their ground, the club moved up to Division One of the United Counties League in 1985. Since then the club have remained in Division One, twice finishing as runners-up, and winning the division without losing a match in 2006–07. In the summer of 2013, managers Steve Sargent and Matty Freeman were sacked and replaced by former Flourmen striker James Daldy and his assistant and former professional Tommy Jaszczun. In the summer of 2013, Whitworth experienced a large turnover of players and eventually finished 17th in Division One in Daldy's first season. During the 2013–14 season Whitworth recorded their record high win, defeating Woodford United 16–0 on 17 March 2014. The goalscorers were Ross Patrick (2), Dan Bendon, Jonny Hazell, Matt Hibberd (3), Taylor Orosz (3), Mark Pryor (2) and Jamie White (3). A UCL record that still stands today. The Flourmen finished a respectable 7th in the 2014–15 season after threatening promotion for a number of early months. In January 2014, Whitworth signed 46-year-old former England defender Neil Ruddock. Daldy departed early into the 2015-16 season and was replaced by his assistant, Tommy Jaszczun for the remainder of the season. In 2016 James Mallows was appointed manager replacing Jaszczun and The Flourmen were promoted from the United Counties League Division One in the 2016-17 season in Mallows' debut season. The club competed in the United Counties League Premier Division in the 2017–18 season for the first time in their existence and in their first-ever game beat Peterborough Northern Star F.C. 5–0 away from home. The Flourmen survived their first season in the UCL Premier on goal difference after beating local rivals Wellingborough Town 3–1 on the final day of the season. The 2018–19 season was tougher for them though as they slipped back into UCL Division One. In the summer of 2019, Simon Anderson was appointed the First Team Manager, during the season James Mallows returned to the club as First Team Manager Honours *United Counties League **Division One Champions 2006–07 **Division One Runners-Up 2016-17 *East Midlands Alliance **Munton Cup winners twice *Rushden & District League **Division One Champions 1975–76, 1976–77 Records *Record attendance: 1,150 vs Wellingborough Town, United Counties League Division One, 24 December 2005 *Record win: 16-0 vs Woodford United, United Counties League Division One, 17 March 2014 News Report Players =Current squad= References External links *Club website Category:Football clubs in England Category:Football clubs in Northamptonshire Category:Wellingborough Category:United Counties League Category:Association football clubs established in 1973 Category:1973 establishments in England ","title":"Wellingborough Whitworth F.C."},{"id":"3884125","text":"Wellingborough Town F.C. is a football club based in Wellingborough, Northamptonshire, England. They play in the United Counties Premier Division. History The club, Wellingborough Town 2004, was formed in 2004 after the previous club bearing the name had folded. History of the club that folded and thus ended is below. The club with the same name, was originally formed in 1867. It is claimed that this made it not only the oldest club in Northamptonshire, but also the sixth-oldest in the country. However since folding, this is no longer the case. The club played originally under the part-handling code, until becoming a genuine soccer club in 1869, playing at Broad Green, wearing an old gold and black strip. In 1879 Wellingborough Town became the first club to play under floodlights, when they entertained Bedford at the Bassett's Close ground, using lights powered by generators either end of the pitch. The club joined Division One of the Southern League in 1901–02, moving to their current ground at the Dog & Duck in London Road. In 1905 the club changed name to Wellingborough Redwell but resigned at the end of the season after finishing bottom of Division One, continuing to be called Wellingborough Redwell until reverting to Wellingborough Town in 1919. Wellingborough joined the Metropolitan League in 1968–69, finishing seventh. They won the title the following season and joined the West Midlands (Regional) League Premier Division, finishing third. In 1971–72, they joined the Southern League Division One North. A reorganisation of the league saw it split into Southern and Midland Divisions, with Wellingborough playing in the Midland Division. However, they struggled, until in 1988–89 they were relegated to the United Counties League. The club struggled for thirteen seasons in the UCL, narrowly avoiding relegation from the Premier Division in a number of seasons. However, they could hold out no longer than 2001–02 when the club folded and they resigned from the League. From the 2019-20 season, Jake Stone took over as First Team Manager after replacing Gary Petts after leaving Cogenhoe United FC. On 2 November, Wellingborough Town reached the furthest in their history in The FA Vase when they beat Dudley Town FC 1--0 in the Second Round. They are due to play away at Wroxham FC in the Third Round on 30 November 2019. =Rebirth= Wellingborough had been without a senior football team for two years when three friends got together to set about re- establishing a football club. Together they assembled a group of twenty-four people who worked to get a new club up and running. Included among the number was World Champion snooker player Peter Ebdon, a local man. The Dog & Duck ground had substantially survived, despite becoming the site of a Travelodge motel. Laurie Owen played a huge part in reforming the club and still plays an active part on the club's committee today. The Doughboys spent their comeback campaign in the Northamptonshire Senior Youth League. Their application for re-admission to the UCL was approved by the FA. The club finished runners-up in Division One for the loss of just one game in 2005–06 and were promoted back to the Premier Division. Improvements to the ground have seen it graded as suitable for Southern League football. Under the leadership of chairman Martin Goode, the club ended the 2007/08 season in 10th position, having been on the fringes of promotion throughout the season until a poor run of defeats saw them fall away. Goode resigned in May 2008 with local businessman David Clingo taking over the role. Manager Jason Burnham left in October 2008 to be replaced by Joe Smyth. Clingo, however, stepped down in November 2008 with former Doughboy Manager and Chairman Martin Potton taking over the helm with the club in extreme danger of going out of business due to the lack of sponsorship from local businesses. Also departing the club at the time was Director of Football Steve Whitney, the Reserve Team Manager Simon Anderson and a number of players meaning that new recruits Joe Smyth and his assistant Kevin Fox had to recruit new players for both teams. In December 2008 the club signed former Premier League striker and Jamaica international Trevor Benjamin arguably one of the most experienced and famous players who has played for the club. Smyth and his management team kept the club in the Premier Division of the UCL and played a big part in stabilising the club during a rocky financial period in early 2009 before stepping down for personal reasons in May 2009. The club then appointed former Northampton Town player Rob Gould as first team manager and assistant Nick Verity. Verity left due to personal reasons at the start of the 2012–13 season. After a disappointing start to the 2012–13 season Rob Gould resigned as manager on 10 September 2012Rob Gould steps down!Gould resigns as Douughboys boss and was replaced by former Woodford United boss, Phil Mason. When Mason was forced to stand down due to person reasons he was replaced by Craig Adams. The club had endured a poor start to the 12/13 season but a superb unbeaten run in the New Year saw them ensure survival. A winner from Todd Sawko in the 2–1 home win against Spalding on 25 April made it mathematically certain and the team left the field to the tune of \\"The Great Escape\\" booming over the tannoy. The 2013/14 season saw the return of former goalscoring hero Jason Turner, who left the club for spells with King's Lynn and Holbeach. He scored prolifically once again as the club enjoyed a much better campaign and posted an attendance of 850 for the Boxing Day clash with AFC Rushden and Diamonds. Manager Craig Adams left for Bedford Town towards the end of the season and was replaced by Ben Watts. With several players having departed during the summer (including Turner to Diamonds) Watts had a difficult job in rebuilding the team and left the club after suffering 4 defeats from the opening 4 games. He was replaced by the joint pairing of Steve Herring and Joe Smyth, assisted by Steve's brother Mark. On 1 April 2015, it was announced that joint managers Steve Herring and Joe Smyth were to step down at the end of the season due to a reduction on playing budget. It was also decided later that week that Jamie Wright, former assistant manager under Craig Adams, would take the position of first team manager for the 2015/16 season. In September 2015, Wright and his assistant Colin Cooper, both resigned with Craig Adams returning as Interim First Team Manager. In November 2015, local management team Jon Mitchell and Stuart Goosey were handed the roles of First Team and Assistant Manager as the Doughboys look to the future with local players making up the majority of the squad. The duo's first result was a 3-1 victory away at Rothwell Corinthians. Although the side remained in the bottom two for much of the campaign, a considerable improvement in form in the final months of the season ensured that they avoided finishing in the relegation spots. A noteworthy achievement because the clubhouse had been destroyed by fire before Christmas and match-day income was reduced drastically until it had been rebuilt. In the summer of 2016, Chairman Martin Potton stood down and was replaced by Mark Darnell and Darren Wingrove. The club have held on to many players and brought in some new signings, ensuring that hopes are higher for the coming season. On 21 July 2016, the club released a joint-statement with AFC Rushden and Diamonds, announcing that Dog and Duck landlord Alper Ozdgan had invoked a clause in their lease agreement, forcing them to leave the ground by 31 May 2017. Diamonds confirmed that they would be seeking an alternative ground share, whereas Wellingborough stated that they felt certain that eviction would ultimately bring an end to the club's 149-year existence.http://www.northantstelegraph.co.uk/sport/football/local/diamonds- and-doughboys-facing-eviction-from-dog-duck-1-7487477 However the club were allowed to remain at the ground, this ending the uncertainty. =Notable former players= *Phil Neal the former Liverpool and England player .

It is inventoried by the New York State Department of Transportation (NYSDOT) as New York State Route 908H (NY 908H), an unsigned reference route. Route description Ocean Parkway extends over a distance of about five miles (8 km), running almost north to south from Machate Circle at the southwestern corner of Prospect Park to the Atlantic Ocean waterfront at Brighton Beach. The NYSDOT designates the section south of Church Avenue as an unsigned reference route. Ocean Parkway begins at Machate Circle at the southern entrance of Prospect Park and travels westward before merging south into Prospect Expressway. After the expressway ends at Church Avenue, then passes through Windsor Terrace and what is present-day Kensington. The parkway runs roughly parallel to Coney Island Avenue, an important commercial avenue several blocks to the east. After running through several neighborhoods such as Midwood, Homecrest, and Sheepshead Bay, the parkway ends at Surf Avenue in Brighton Beach, close to the Riegelmann Boardwalk and ocean. The parkway is similar to Eastern Parkway in its layout. It includes a central seven-lane roadway (the middle lane being used for left turns), two grassy medians on each side with bike and pedestrian paths, two service roads on the periphery, and two exterior sidewalks, for a total width of 210 feet (64 m). The Brooklyn Parks Commission initially controlled another to each side. According to the original legislation, the medians could only used for trees, plazas, and other ornamentation. As such, trees, playing tables, and benches line the pedestrian path and boulevard. A bike lane is located on the western median. History Frederick Law Olmsted and Calvert Vaux, who were also responsible for designing Central Park and Prospect Park, suggested the construction of Eastern Parkway and Ocean Parkway to Brooklyn park commissioners in reports prepared in 1866. The proposed Ocean and Eastern Parkways would connect Prospect Park with Coney Island and East New York, respectively. Their plan for the parkways were inspired by boulevards such as Under den Linden in Berlin and Avenue Foch in Paris. However, Ocean and Eastern Parkways were considered to be improvements over these two thoroughfares, since both would contain service roads separated from the main road by tree-lined medians. Because the road to Coney Island would reach the ocean, it was thus called \\"Ocean Parkway\\".Apartment buildings at Ocean Parkway and 18th Ave. On May 11, 1869, the New York State Legislature gave authority to the City of Brooklyn's commissioners to \\"lay out, open, and improve a public highway or avenue from Prospect Park, in the City of Brooklyn, towards Coney Island.\\" The act was later amended in 1872. The parkway's construction started in 1874, and the next year, the segment was open between Prospect Park and Kings Highway. The remaining section to Coney Island started in \\"early spring\\" 1876 and was finished on November 11 of that year. Construction costs were paid by landowners whose property laid on either side of the parkway. The costs at the time were estimated as being $1 million (), with the section north of Kings Highway accounting for three-fourths of the cost. Subsequent legislation passed in 1882 relieved these landowners of two-thirds of that cost. The pedestrian path was split in 1894 to create the first bike path in the United States; the cyclists' speed limit was on the parkway and on the bike path. The Prospect Expressway, built in the 1950s, replaced the northernmost half-mile of the parkway. By the 1970s, there were calls both to renew Ocean Parkway and to make it into a landmark. After a short controversy over whether such a landmark was eligible for federal funds, the parkway was designated a landmark by the city in 1975. Afterward, Ocean Parkway was restored and repaved. The Special Ocean Parkway District was designated by the city in 1978, and the reconstruction was completed two years later. In 2016 an overhaul of traffic regulations at major intersections was proposed, including traffic signals for service roads. The regulations were unpopular among residents, but have gone into effect at Kings Highway and Avenue J. The project was finished in 2017. As part of the Vision Zero program and to reduce traffic-related deaths, speed limits were lowered to . = Horseback riding = Bridle paths formerly existed on Ocean Parkway as well. The bridle paths were on the eastern side of Ocean Parkway; equestrians could rent horses near Prospect Park and ride them on Ocean Parkway as far as Coney Island. In the parkway's early years, horse and sleigh racing took place on the bridle paths. Both the Gravesend Race Track and Brighton Beach Race Course were adjacent to Ocean Parkway, and horse racing took place there as well. In 1908 or 1910, a ban on open betting took effect, and horse races stopped at all of these facilities. By the mid-20th century, horseback riding in Brooklyn was in decline as people switched to automobiles, and equestrian activities became more of a hobby. These paths were removed during the 1978 rezoning. Although one can still rent horses at the nearby Kensington Stables, the bridle paths on Ocean Parkway have since been paved over and are no longer in use. Another stable, at Avenue S and Coney Island Avenue, was removed.  Neighborhood  Much of Ocean Parkway is zoned for mid-to-high rise residential structures. Around 1900, homes were constructed along the perimeter of the parkway, and during World War I, many mansions were built. There is once school along the street -- Abraham Lincoln High School. Buyers came to Ocean Parkway from Bedford-Stuyvesant, Brooklyn Heights, and Bushwick. In the 1920s, apartment complexes and one- and two- family homes were constructed; the northernmost portion of the parkway became the site of luxurious, elevator-equipped apartment buildings. Apartments began to replace older homes in the vicinity of the parkway after World War II. Since the 1978 designation of the Special Ocean Parkway District, new developments on Ocean Parkway must comply with several regulations. In particular, these developments must have a \\"landscaped front yard unobstructed by porches, canopies or stairs\\". Paving is not permitted except on driveways and walkways. By the 1970s, the neighborhoods around Ocean Parkway had the highest concentrations of Syrian Jews in the United States. In 1980, it was estimated that 60 to 70 percent of the population was Syrian Jewish. This was reflected in the high density of synagogues, yeshivas, and other traditionally Jewish institutions around Ocean Parkway. Transportation The New York City Subway's BMT Brighton Line () serves the Ocean Parkway station in Brighton Beach. The B1 travels on the parkway in Sheepshead Bay and the B9 travels on the parkway for one block in Midwood.

The term does not apply to all protection of missions, but only to that permanently exercised in virtue of an acquired right, usually established by a treaty or convention (either explicit or tacit), voluntarily consented to or accepted after more or less compulsion by the infidel power. The object of the protectorate may be more or less extensive, according as it embraces only the missionaries who are subjects of the protecting power, or applies to the missionaries of all nations or even to their neophytes, the native Christians. To comprehend fully the nature of the protectorate of missions, as it has been in times past and as it is to-day, it will be necessary to study separately the Protectorate of the Levant and that of the Far East. This article deals with a historical approach to the 'legitimation' of protectorates by the need to facilitate the 'holy' duty of spreading the Christian faith, as invoked by Catholic, Orthodox and Protestant colonial/imperial powers. This comprises the missions of the countries under Ottoman rule, especially Constantinople, the Archipelago, Syria, Palestine, Egypt, Barbary etc. It was French in origin, and was, until near the end of the nineteenth century, the almost exclusive privilege of France. Background In the Holy Land, Charlemagne secured from the Caliph Haroun al-Raschid a certain share in his sovereignty over the Holy Places of Jerusalem. Charlemagne and his successors made use of this concession to establish pious and charitable foundations there, to protect the Christian inhabitants and pilgrims, and to ensure the availability of Christian worship. The destruction of the Arabian Empire by the Turks put an end to this first protectorate, and for reasons that were not purely religious, led to the Crusades, as a result of which Palestine was conquered from the Saracens and became a Latin, French-speaking kingdom. The Christian rule was later replaced by that of Islam, but during the three centuries of Crusades, which had been undertaken and supported mainly by France, the Christians of the East had grown accustomed to look to that country for assistance in oppression or to gain more leverage in their dealings with the Ottomans, while France valued its increasingly important role in the region and its accompanying geopolitical benefits. There lies the germ of the modern Protectorate of the Levant. France in the Levant The protectorate began to assume a contractual form in the sixteenth century, in the treaties concluded between the kings of France and the Ottoman Sultans, which are historically known as Capitulations. At first this name designated the commercial agreement conceded by the Sublime Porte to Latin merchants (first to the Italians), and arose from the fact that the articles of these agreements were called capitoli 'chapters' in the Italian redaction: the term has not, therefore, the same humiliating meaning as in military parlance (conceding utter defeat), but a similar neutral etymology as the Carolingian Capitularia. Francis I was the first king of France who sought an alliance with Turkey. To this he was urged, not by the spirit of the Crusaders, but entirely by the desire to break in Europe the dominating power of the imperial Habsburg House of Austria. By compelling Austria to spend its forces in defense against the Turks in the East, he hoped to weaken it and render it unable to increase or even to maintain its power in the West. The next French kings down to Louis XV followed the same policy, which, whatever criticism it merits, was as a matter of fact favourable to Christianity in the Levant, seeking by their zeal in defending Christian interests at the Porte, to extenuate their alliance with infidels, which was a source of scandal even in France. As early as 1528, Francis I had appealed to Suleiman the Magnificent to restore to the Christians of Jerusalem a church which the Turks had converted into a mosque. The Sultan refused on the plea that his religion would not permit alteration of the purpose of a mosque, but he promised to maintain the Christians in possession of all the other places occupied by them and to defend them against all oppression. However, religion was not the object of a formal convention between France and Turkey prior to 1604, when Henry IV of France secured from Ahmad I the insertion, in the capitulations of 20 May, of two clauses relative to the protection of pilgrims and of the religious in charge of the church of the Holy Sepulchre. The following are the relevant clauses of the treaty: \\"Article IV. We also desire and command that the subjects of the said Emperor [sic] of France, and those of the princes who are his friends and allies, may be free to visit the Holy Places of Jerusalem, and no one shall attempt to prevent them nor do them injury\\"; \\"Article V. Moreover, for the honor and friendship of this Emperor, we desire that the religious living in Jerusalem and serving the church of Comane [the Resurrection] may dwell there, come and go without let or hindrance, and be well received, protected, assisted, and helped in consideration of the above.\\" It is noteworthy that the same advantages are stipulated for the French and for the friends and allies of France, but for the latter in consideration of, and at the recommendation of France. The result of this friendship was the development of the Catholic missions, which began to flourish through the assistance of Henry IV Bourbon and his son Louis XIII Bourbon and through the zeal of the French missionaries. Before the middle of the seventeenth century, various religious orders (Capuchin, Carmelite, Dominican, Franciscan and Jesuit) were established, as chaplains of the French ambassadors and consuls, in major Ottoman cities (Istanbul, Alexandria, Smyrna, Aleppo, Damascus etc.), Lebanon and the islands of the Aegean Archipelago. They assembled the Catholics to instruct and confirm them in the Catholic faith, opened schools to which flocked the children of all rites, relieved the spiritual and corporal miseries of the Christians in the frightful Turkish prisons, and nursed the pest-stricken, which last office made many martyrs of charity. During the reign of Louis XIV, the missionaries multiplied and extended the field of their activities: the Sun King' gave them at once a material and a moral support, which the prestige of his victories and conquests rendered irresistible at the Porte. Thanks to him, the often precarious tolerance, on which the existence of the missions had previously depended, was officially recognized in 1673, when on 5 June, Mehmed IV not only confirmed the earlier capitulations guaranteeing the safety of pilgrims and the religious guardians of the Holy Sepulchre, but signed four new articles, all beneficial to the missionaries. The first decreed in a general manner \\"that all bishops or other religious of the Latin sect [cfr. Millet (Ottoman Empire)] who are subjects of France, whatever their condition, shall be throughout our empire as they have been hitherto, and [may] there perform their functions, and no one shall trouble or hinder them\\"; the others secure the tranquil possession of their churches, explicitly to the Jesuits and Capuchins, and in general \\"to the French at Smyrna, Saïd, Alexandria, and in all other ports of the Ottoman Empire\\". The reign of Louis XIV marked the apogee of the French Protectorate in the East, for not only the Latin missionaries of all nationalities, but also the heads of all Catholic communities, regardless of rite or nationality, appealed to the Grand Roi, and at the recommendation of his ambassadors and consuls to the Porte and the pashas, obtained justice and protection from their enemies. Though the missionaries were sometimes on such amicable terms with the non-Catholic clergy that the latter authorized them to preach in their churches, they usually experienced a lively hostility from that quarter. On several occasions the Greek and Armenian Non-Uniate Patriarchs, displeased at seeing a great portion of their flocks abandon them for the Roman priests, on various pretexts persuaded the Turkish Government to forbid all propaganda by the latter, but representatives of Louis XIV successfully opposed this ill- will. At the beginning of the reign of Louis XV the preponderance of French influence with the Porte was also manifested in the authority granted the Franciscans, who were protégés of France, to repair the dome of the Holy Sepulchre: this meant the recognition of their right of proprietorship in the Holy Sepulchre as superior to the claims of the Greeks and the Armenians. In 1723 the Non-Uniate Patriarchs succeeded in obtaining from the Sultan a \\"command\\" forbidding his Christian subjects to embrace the Roman religion, and the Latin religious to hold any communication with the Greeks, Armenians and Syrians, on the pretext of instructing them. French diplomacy sought, long in vain, to have this disastrous measure revoked. At last, as a reward for the services rendered to Turkey during its wars with Russia and Austria (1736–1739), the French succeeded in 1740 in securing the renewal of the capitulations, with additions which explicitly confirmed the right of the French Protectorate, and at least implicitly guaranteed the liberty of the Catholic apostolate. By the eighty-seventh of the articles signed on 28 May 1740, Sultan Mahmud I declared: \\"... The bishops and religious subject to the Emperor of France living in my empire shall be protected while they confine themselves to the exercise of their office, and no one may prevent them from practising their rite according to their custom in the churches in their possession, as well as in the other places they inhabit; and, when our tributary subjects and the French hold intercourse for purposes of selling, buying, and other business, no one may molest them for this sake in violation of the sacred laws.\\" In subsequent treaties between France and Turkey, the capitulations were not repeated verbatim, but they are recalled and confirmed (e. g. in 1802 and 1838). The various regimes which succeeded the monarchy of St. Louis and of Louis XIV all maintained in law, and in fact, the ancient privilege of France in the protection of the missionaries and Christian communities of the Orient. The expedition in 1860 sent by Emperor Napoleon III to put a stop to the massacre of the Maronites was in harmony with the ancient rôle of France, and would have been more so if its work of justice had been more complete. The Far East Beginning in the 15th century, popes granted to the Crown of Portugal the right to designate candidates for the sees and ecclesiastical benefices in the vast domains acquired through the expeditions it sponsored in Africa and the East Indies. This is sometimes called the Portuguese Protectorate of Missions, but more properly the \\"Portuguese Patronage\\" (Padroado). It allowed the King of Portugal to benefit from a certain portion of the ecclesiastical revenues of his kingdom, and it carried the condition that he should send good missionaries to his new subjects, and that he should provide with a fitting endowment the dioceses, parishes and religious establishments established in his acquired territories. The Holy See contested Portugal's assertion of these rights to regions it claimed but never conquered, including the greater part of India, Tong-king, Cochin-China (both in present Vietnam), Siam and especially China. Portugal tried to exert influence through its ambassadors to China in the 18th century, instructing them to intervene as much as possible to protect missionaries and native Christians from ongoing persecution in the provinces. Portugal's authority was not comparable to the protectorate regime exercised by France in the Near East or Far East in later centuries and Portugal's rights as protector were never recognized by a host nation. No Christian power exercised a protectorate in China before the 19th century. =France= The French Protectorate, as far as a regular convention is concerned, dates from the middle of the nineteenth century, but the way was prepared by the protection which French statesmen had accorded the missionaries for almost two centuries. The zeal and liberality of Louis XIV permitted the foundation of the great French Jesuit mission, which in less than fifteen years (1687–1701) more than doubled the number of apostolic workers in China, and never ceased to produce most capable workers. The first official relations were formed between France and China when the missionaries brought thither by the \\"Amphitrite\\", the first French vessel seen in Chinese waters (1699), presented gifts from Louis XIV to the Kangxi Emperor. The two monarchs shared the expense of erecting the first French church at Peking: the emperor donated land within the limits of the imperial city and the building materials, the French king paid for the labor, the decoration and the magnificent liturgical ornaments. Several other churches erected in the provinces through the munificence of Louis XIV increased the prestige of France throughout the empire. Under Louis XV the mission in China, like many other things, was somewhat overlooked, but the government did not wholly neglect it. It found a zealous protector in Louis XVI's minister Bertin, but it felt keenly the suppression of the Society of Jesus and the French Revolution with all its consequences, which dried up the source of the apostolate in Europe. It was a handful of French missionaries, such as Lazarists or members of the Society of Foreign Missions, assisted by some Chinese priests, who preserved the Faith throughout the persecutions of the early nineteenth century, during which several of them were martyred. When the English, after the so-called Opium War, imposed on China the Treaty of Nanking (1842), they did not at first ask for religious liberty, but the murder of the Lazarist John Gabriel Perboyre (11 September 1840) becoming known, they added an article stipulating that thenceforth a missionary taken in the interior of the country should not be tried by the Chinese authorities, but should be delivered to the nearest consul of his country. On 24 October 1844, French ambassador Théodore de Lagrené secured further concessions which inaugurated a new era. The Treaty of Whampoa, which was signed on that date at Whampoa, speaks only of liberty for the French to settle in certain territory in the open ports, but at the request of the ambassador, an imperial edict was sent to the mandarins and at least partially promulgated, praising the Christian religion and removing the prohibition for Chinese to practice it. However, the execution of the missionary Auguste Chapdelaine in 1856 and other facts showed the insufficiency of the guarantees accorded to Europeans; to obtain others, England and France had recourse to arms. The war (1858–1860, cfr. Second Opium War), which showed China its weakness, was ended by the treaties of T'ien-tsin (24–25 October 1860). They contained an article which stipulated freedom for the missionaries to preach and for the Chinese to embrace Christianity. This article was included in the treaties which other powers a little later concluded with China. To the treaty with France was also added a supplementary article, which reads as follows: \\"An imperial edict conformable to the imperial edict of 20 February 1846 [that secured by M. de Lagrené], will inform the people of the whole empire that soldiers and civilians be permitted to propagate and practice the religion of the Lord of Heaven [Catholic], to assemble for explanation of doctrine, to build churches wherein to celebrate their ceremonies. Those [the mandarins] who henceforth make searches or arbitrary arrests must be punished. Furthermore, the temples of the Lord of Heaven, together with the schools, cemeteries, lands, buildings etc., which were confiscated formerly when the followers of the religion of the Lord of Heaven were persecuted, shall be either restored or compensated for. Restoration is to be made to the French ambassador residing at Peking, who will transfer the property to the Christians of the localities concerned. In all the provinces also the missionaries shall be permitted to rent or purchase lands and erect buildings at will\\". The general and exclusive right of protection granted to the French over all the Catholic missions in China could not be more explicitly recognized than it was by this agreement, which made the French ambassador the indispensable intermediary in the matter of all restitutions. And the representatives of France never ceased to make full use of this right in favor of the missionaries, whom from the middle of the nineteenth century a revival of Apostolic zeal drew from all countries to China. From them the passports necessary to penetrate into the interior of the country were regularly sought, and to them were addressed complaints and claims, which it was their duty to lay before the Chinese Government. The French ministers also secured, not without difficulty, the necessary additions to the Treaty of T'ien-tsin—such, for instance, as the Berthemy Convention (1865) with the Gerard addition (1895), regulating the important question of the purchase of lands and buildings in the interior. The foregoing historical sketch shows that the ancient French right of protection over the missions, in both Turkey and China, was established as much by constant exercise and by services rendered as by treaties. Furthermore, it was based on the fundamental right of the Church, derived from God Himself, to preach the Gospel everywhere and to receive from Christian powers the assistance necessary to enable her to perform her task untrammeled. The desire to further the Catholic church's mission, which always guided the French monarchs to a greater or less extent, does not influence the present government. The latter endeavors, however, to preserve the prerogative of its predecessors, and continues to lend protection, though much diminished, to the Catholic missionary undertakings—even to those directed by religious who are proscribed in France (e. g. it subsidizes the Jesuit schools in Syria). The advantages of the protectorate are too obvious even to the least clerical of the ministers for them not to attempt to retain them, whatever the resulting contradictions in their policy. It is very evident that France owed to this protectorate throughout the Levant and in the Far East a prestige and a moral influence which no commerce or conquest could ever have given her. Thanks to the protectorate, the treasures of respect, gratitude and affection won by the Catholic missionaries became to a certain extent the property of France; and, if the French entertained doubts as to the utility of this time-honored privilege (a few anti-clericals attempt to obscure the evidence on this point), the efforts of rival nations to secure a share of it would prove enlightening. These efforts have been frequent, especially since 1870, and have been to a large extent successful. =Other countries= ;Germany In 1875, at the time of the negotiations between France and -nominally Ottoman- Egypt with regard to judiciary reform, the German government declared that it \\"recognized no exclusive right of protection of any power in behalf of Catholic establishments in the East, and that it reserved its rights with regard to German subjects belonging to any of these establishments\\". Against French claims to an exclusive protectorate and in support of its own claims to exercise the privileges of a protectorate, Germany later cited the language agreed to by Austria-Hungary, France, Germany, Great Britain, Italy, Russia, and the Ottoman Empire in article 62 of the Treaty of Berlin in 1878: \\"Ecclesiastics, pilgrims and monks of all nationalities traveling in Turkey in Europe or Turkey in Asia shall enjoy the same rights, advantages and privileges. The official right of protection of the diplomatic and consular agents of the Powers in Turkey is recognized, with regard both to the above- mentioned persons and to their religious, charitable and other establishments in the Holy Places and elsewhere.\\" The passage immediately following this paragraph in the article was overlooked: \\"The acquired rights of France are explicitly reserved, and there shall be no interference with the statu quo in the Holy Places.\\" Thus the protection guaranteed to all ecclesiastics etc., no matter what their nationality or religion, as well as the generally recognized right of all the powers to watch over this protection, should be understood with the reservation of the \\"acquired rights\\" of France i.e. of its ancient protectorate in behalf of Catholics. This protectorate is therefore really confirmed by the Treaty of Berlin. But as a matter of fact, the influence of Russia, which has assumed the protectorate of Orthodox Christians, already greatly affected the standing which the ancient French Protectorate had assured to Catholics in Palestine and especially in Jerusalem. Moreover, Emperor William II of Germany has installed Protestantism with a magnificent church beside the Holy Sepulchre in 1898. As a sort of compensation he indeed ceded to German Catholics the site of the Dormition of the Blessed Virgin, which he obtained from the Sultan where a church and a monastery were erected and, together with the other German establishments, placed under the protection of the German Empire, without deference to the ancient prerogative of France. A similar situation prevailed in China. First, in 1888, Germany obtained from the Chinese imperial Government that German passports should insure the same advantages to the missionaries as those secured at the French legation. At the same time the German Catholic missionaries of Shan-tung, who had much to endure from the infidels, were on several occasions offered the powerful protection of the German Empire. Mgr. Anzer, the vicar Apostolic, decided to accept it, after having, as he declares, several times sought unsuccessfully the aid of the French minister. In 1896 the German ambassador at Peking received from Berlin the command to support energetically the claims of the Catholic missionaries and even to declare that the German Empire would pledge itself to defend against all unjust oppression the persons and property of the mission of Shan-tung, together with freedom of preaching, in the same measure in which such had been formerly guaranteed by the French Protectorate. The murder of two of the Shan-tung missionaries in November 1897 afforded the occasion for a more solemn affirmation of the new protectorate, while it furnished a long-sought pretext for the occupation of Kiaochow. ;Austria Austria concluded various treaties with the Ottoman Empire in 1699 (Treaty of Karlowitz), 1718 (Treaty of Passarowitz), and 1739 (Treaty of Belgrade) that secured a right of protection over \\"the religious\\" in the Empire and even at Jerusalem, though never including a guarantee of liberty of worship. Austria never exercised authority as a protector except in the countries bordering on Habsburg Austria, notably Albania and Macedonia. In 1848 the Austrian Protectorate was extended to the Christian missions in the Sudan and Nigritia, which were in the care of Austrian priests. When the Coptic Catholic hierarchy was restored in Egypt by Pope Leo XIII in 1895, the new patriarch and his suffragans placed themselves under the protection of Austria. Position of the Holy See The Holy See defended the French Protectorate on several occasions. Whenever missionaries sought protection from any other country, the French diplomatic corps complained to Rome, and the Congregation for the Propagation of the Faith reprimand the missionaries and reminded them that France had to sole right to safeguard there interests in non-Christian nations. This happened in 1744 and 1844.Civiltà Cattolica, 5 November 1904 Italy sought to establish its own protectorate by patronizing missionary activities and winning the allegiance of those it supported, but the Congregation for the Propagation of the Faith refused to support its efforts. Instead, on 22 May 1888, the Congregation wrote to the Italian missionaries in the Levant and the Far East to remind them that \\"the Protectorate of the French Nation in the countries of the East has been established for centuries and sanctioned even by treaties between the empires. Therefore, there must be absolutely no innovation in this matter; this protectorate, wherever it is in force, is to be religiously preserved, and the missionaries are warned that, if they have need of any help, they are to have recourse to the consuls and other ministers of France.\\" On 1 August 1898, Pope Leo XIII wrote to Cardinal Benoît-Marie Langénieux, Archbishop of Reims: In parallel with this recognition of French exclusivity, the Holy See declined to establish its own diplomatic relations with Turkey and China, even when supported by those governments. Leo XIII rejected any proposal to exchange legates or ambassadors at the instance of French diplomats, who told him those countries had less interest in amicable relations with the Holy See than in evading the authorities granted to the French protectorate. Assessments Critics of the protectorate said that the authorities that granted the privilege top a Christian nation did so under duress, that the system contributed to and exacerbated anti-Christian sentiment in those countries, and that it allowed Christian missionaries to disregard the sensibilities of the non-Christian population. Those who see benefits in the protectorate system contend that it was the best means of protecting missionaries and their activities and allow that it required that the foreign power minimize its meddling and exercise discretion in asserting its rights. As an example, one study noted that the superior of the mission of southeast Chi-li resolved its issues directly with local authorities and sought intervention from the French legation only three times during the difficult period from 1862 to 1884.Em. Becker, \\"Le R. P. Joseph Gonnet\\", Ho-kien-fou, 1907, p. 275 They believed abuses were minimal, especially in comparison with the benefits.

She was blessed with a secure, powerful, ringing voice, fine musicianship and an excellent technique. These attributes enabled her to enjoy a highly successful career in New York City and London, performing heavy dramatic roles in the German and Italian repertoires. Biography Gadski was born in Anklam, Prussia, on 15 June 1872, according to most references, but birth records still extant at the Evangelical Church of Saint Mary, Anklam, Germany, state that Johanna Wilhelmine Agnes Emilie Gadski was born on June 15, in 1870. After receiving a musical education in Stettin, she made her operatic debut in Berlin in 1889 in the title role of Tchaikovsky's Undina. > Her studies in singing were principally with Mme.

Hans Tauscher attended an opera, met Gadski, and they married on November 20, 1892 in Berlin, Germany. They had a daughter, Charlotte Tauscher Busch, who was born in Berlin on August 31, 1893, married Ernest Busch, a German grand nephew of Adolphus Busch on June 12 1923, (and died there on March 30, 1967). Highlights of her subsequent career in Germany included appearances in Wagner's works at the 1899 Bayreuth Festival and at the 1905/06 Munich Festival.https://www.naxos.com/person/Johanna_Gadski/9190.htm However, it was in English-speaking countries that Gadski built her international reputation as a diva. She made her successful American debut in New York in 1895 with the Damrosch Opera Company and became popular, too, in England. In 1896 she created the role of Hester Prynne in the fully staged premiere of Walter Damrosch's opera The Scarlet Letter in Boston. She sang in London at the Royal Opera House, Covent Garden, in 1899, 1900, 1901 and 1906. Some sources credit her with appearing at England's Worcester Festival but this is an error. Actually, she sang at America's Worcester festivals, held in the American state of Massachusetts during the late 1890s. Gadski was an extremely popular recitalist and in 1899 and 1900, she embarked on a lengthy concert tour of the United States. She had also joined the star-studded roster of singers at the New York Metropolitan Opera, singing there from 1898 to 1904 and again from 1907 to 1917. Around 1902 she met Mabel Riegelman, a young soprano in San Francisco, and brought Mabel and her sister Ruby Riegelman (who was also her chaperone and accompanist) to Berlin in 1903 as her guest, then settling the two sisters in Stettin to continue their musical studies. In 1911 Gadski and Mabel Riegelman took the to New York City, where Gadski arranged for her star pupil Mabel Riegelman to debut as Gretel in Engelbert Humperdinck's Hansel and Gretel. > The first ways-and-means affair held in the (Woman's Club of El Paso) > clubhouse was a performance by Madame Johanna Gadski, singer, and her > accompanist, Francis Moore, in December 1916.

During World War I, Hans Tauscher was accused of plotting sabotage against the Welland Canal along with Franz von Papen, Captain Karl Boy-Ed, Constantine Covani, and Franz von Rintelen. He was indicted with Franz von Papen but acquitted by a federal jury. (Text version) After the United States entered World War I in 1917, the Metropolitan Opera suspended performances of works from the German repertory. Gadski was offered the choice to resign or be dismissedAt the final performance of the season, on 13 April, Johanna Gadski, one of the reigning Wagnerian singers of her time, was granted permission to announce her \\"retirement\\" rather than be officially dismissed from the Met because of her German links. Legend has it that she was deported from the United States as an alien enemy but this is not true. She spent the duration of the war living quietly in New York and Lake Spofford, New Hampshire, and did not revisit Germany until 1922.http://chroniclingamerica.loc.gov/lccn/sn83045366/1906-07-01/ed-1/seq-44.pdf =After WW I= Gadski in 1917 Gadski resumed her professional concert career in the United States in 1921; she did not, however, return to the operatic stage until 1928 when she sang in a production of Die Walküre mounted by the Washington National Opera, a semi-professional company not related to its present namesake.McPherson, Jim, \\"Mr. Meek Goes to Washington: The Story of the Small-Potatoes Canadian Baritone Who Founded America's 'National' Opera,\\" The Opera Quarterly, volume 20, no. 2, Spring 2004 Thereafter, in the years 1929 to 1931, Gadski made three tours as the star of her German Grand Opera Company, which produced dozens of performances of Richard Wagner's Der Ring des Nibelungen. By this late date, however, her voice had declined due to advancing age and overwork in her early years. Gadski was visiting Germany when she was killed in an automobile accident in Berlin on 22 February 1932. Jessica Chastain bought Gadski's apartment at The Osborne on West 57th Street in 2015. Legacy During her prime, Gadski was popular on both sides of the Atlantic as a Wagnerian singer, but she was equally splendid as a performer of the more taxing Italian operatic roles such as Aida by Verdi. She had a beautiful voice in her prime, with ringing high notes and a remarkably nimble technique for such a large vocal instrument. Gadski made numerous recordings for the Victor Talking Machine Company in the United States from 1903 to 1917. Her complete Victor recordings have been reissued by Marston Records on two multi-disc sets of CDs. These sets also contain the Mapleson Cylinders of her voice that were recorded live from the stage of the Metropolitan Opera House during the first years of the 20th century.

He is also the inventor of the first cracking method. Besides the innovations he brought to the oil industry and the construction of numerous bridges and buildings, Shukhov was the inventor of a new family of doubly curved structural forms. These forms, based on non- Euclidean hyperbolic geometry, are known today as hyperboloids of revolution. Shukhov developed not only many varieties of light-weight hyperboloid towers and roof systems, but also the mathematics for their analysis. Shukhov is particularly reputed for his original designs of hyperboloid towers such as the Shukhov Tower. Biography Factory of Shukhov cracking process, Baku, USSR, 1932 Vladimir Shukhov was born in a town of Graivoron, Belgorod uezd, Kursk Governorate (in present-day Belgorod Oblast) into a petty noble family. His father Grigory Ivanovich Shukhov was a minor government official, promoted for his efforts in the Crimean War. For a while, Grigory served as Mayor of Graivoron and later as an administrator in Warsaw. In 1864 Vladimir entered Saint Petersburg gymnasium from which he graduated with distinction in 1871. During his high school years he showed mathematical talents, once demonstrating to his classmates and teacher an original proof of the Pythagorean theorem. The teacher praised his skills but he failed the grade for violating the textbook's guidelines. The world's first diagrid hyperboloid structure by Shukhov, Nizhny Novgorod, 1896 The world's first double curvature steel diagrid by Shukhov (during construction), Vyksa near Nizhny Novgorod, 1897. After graduating from the gymnasium, Shukhov entered the Imperial Moscow Technical School, in which his teachers included Pafnuty Chebyshev, Aleksey Letnikov, and Nikolay Zhukovsky. In the beginning of the year 1876 Shukhov graduated from school with distinction and a Gold Medal. Chebyshev offered him a job as a lecturer in mathematics at the Imperial Moscow Technical School, but Shukhov decided to seek a job in the engineering industry instead. In May 1876 Shukhov went to Philadelphia, to work on the Russian pavilion at the Centennial Exposition, the first official World's Fair in the United States, and to study the inner workings of the American construction and engineering industries. During his stay in the US, Shukhov came to know a Russian-American entrepreneur, Alexander Veniaminovich Bari who also worked on the organization of the Fair. In 1877 Shukhov returned to Russia and joined the drafting office of the Warsaw–Vienna railroad. Within several months, Shukhov's frustration with standard and routine engineering made him abandon the office and join a military-medical academy. Shukhov Tower in Moscow. It is currently under threat of demolition, and there is an international campaign to save it. On his coming to Russia in 1877, Bari persuaded Shukhov to give up his medical education and to assume the office of Chief Engineer in a new company specializing in innovative engineering. Shukhov worked with Bari at this company until the October Revolution. Their works revolutionized many areas of civil engineering, ship engineering, and oil industry. The thermal cracking method, the Shukhov cracking process, was patented by Vladimir Shukhov in 1891. Shukhov always found time for a passionate hobby – photography.The photographic works of Vladimir Shukhov The photographic works of Shukhov opened new trends ahead of their flourishing of Fine art photography. He made photos in various genres: reporting, city landscape, portrait, constructivism. About two thousand photos and negatives made by Shukhov have survived until this day. After the October Revolution Shukhov decided to stay in the Soviet Union despite having received alluring job offers from all around the world. Many signal Soviet engineering projects of the 1920s were associated with his name. In 1919 he framed his slogan: We should work independently from politics. The buildings, boilers, beams would be needed and so would we. In the later 1930s during the Great Purge he retired from engineering work but was not arrested or persecuted. Shukov died on 2 February 1939 in Moscow and was buried at the Novodevichy Cemetery. His many honours included the Lenin Prize (1929) and the title of Hero of Labour (1932). Works Vladimir Shukhov is often referred as the Russian Edison for the sheer quantity and quality of his pioneering works . He was one of the first to develop practical calculations of stresses and deformations of beams, shells and membranes on elastic foundation. These theoretical results allowed him to design the first Russian oil tanker, new types of oil tanker barges, and a new type of oil reservoirs. The same principle of the shell on an elastic foundation allowed to theoretically calculate the optimal diameter, wall thickness and fluid speed for the fluid pipelines. Shukhov's projects were instrumental in constructing: *An oil pipeline, the first in the Russian Empire, between Balkhany and Cherny Gorod near Baku (12 km, 1878 complete, used by the Branobel). By 1883 the total length of Shukhov-designed, Bari-built oil pipelines in Baku exceeded 94 km, transporting 30,000 barrels of oil per day. In 1894, a similar pipeline network was built in Grozny. Shukhov designed the first Trans-Caucasian kerosene pipeline between Baku and Batumi (835 km long) and Grozny-Tuapse pipeline (618 km long). *A superior design for water-mains. Shukhov designed (and Bari built) complete water-supply systems for the cities of Cherkassy, Tambov, Kharkov, Voronezh and many others. In that age of infectious diseases his water-supply systems likely saved thousands of lives. *A superior design for oil-tanker barges (less than half of the metal previously required), 84 150-meters long barges were built (mostly for the Volga river) as well as the first Russian seaworthy oil tanker ship. His approach to the ship strength analysis (using the model of a shell on an elastic foundation) was absolutely novel for that time. *Shukhov-designed inexpensive oil tanks with the bottom calculated as a membrane on elastic foundation. They became very popular among oil-producers of the Imperial Russia. By 1881, 130 such tanks were built in Baku alone. Shukhov made important contributions to the chemical industry: *He designed and built an oil cracking plant. His patents (Shukhov cracking process – patent of Russian empire No. 12926 from 27 November 1891) on cracking were used to invalidate Standard Oil's patents (Burton process – Patent of USA No. 1,049,667 on 7 January 1913) on oil refineries. *He designed an original oil pump. Shukhov's pumps revolutionized Baku's oil industry allowing to increase its oil output. *He designed one of the first furnaces that used the residual oil: before his works the residual oil was considered a waste and was discarded, due to his works it became recognized as an important technical product known as a fuel oil. Shukhov also left a lasting legacy to the Constructivist architecture of early Soviet Russia. As a leading specialist of metallic structures (hyperboloid structures, thin-shell structures, tensile structures), he may be compared with Gustave Eiffel.

The first houses were built in the late 17th century, after the land had been sold by the Earl of Mar to the patrons of Cowane's Hospital in Stirling. Economic conditions led to stagnation but housing began again in earnest at the start of the 19th century. The real expansion came in the middle of the 20th century, when council housing replaced decrepit housing in the old town. Perhaps the most famous person to have come from the district is football legend Billy Bremner who also attended the local St. Mary's Roman Catholic primary school. Close behind would be Duncan Ferguson who became the most expensive player to move between two British clubs when he left Dundee United for Rangers for £4million in 1993. A more recent football star from Raploch is David Goodwillie.David Goodwillie can become as successful as Duncan Ferguson, says Dick Taylor www.dailyrecord.co.uk, 20 June 2010 The Raploch was the subject of a 2002 BBC Scotland documentary entitled Raploch Stories, and in a 2007 sequel Raploch Stories Revisited. Since 2004, the Raploch area has undergone a great deal of physical regeneration. In 2008 the area became the home of the UK's first El Sistema children's orchestra, called Big Noise Raploch.

He is the owner and chairman of the second-largest television network in Brazil, RecordTV, since 1989 with the Grupo Record, which he founded after he bought the network.  Early life  Edir Macedo was born in Rio de Janeiro in 1945 (one of seven surviving children). According to Macedo's website he holds a doctor's degree in Theology and in Christian Philosophy, and an honorary degree in Divinity from the Faculdade de Educação Teológica do Estado de São Paulo. He also received a masters in theological science through the Federation of Evangelical Religious Entities of Spain in Madrid, Spain. Career In 1963 he began a career as a civil servant, initially working with the state-run lottery of Rio de Janeiro, Loterj, and also at the Brazilian Institute of Geography and Statistics, IBGE, as a researcher in the economic census of 1970. Macedo was raised Catholic, but by 1965 converted to Pentecostalism, after an invitation from his sister to Igreja Cristã de Nova Vida.CORTEN André, DOZON Jean-Pierre, ORO Ari Pedro, Les nouveaux conquérants de la foi-L'Eglise universelle du royaume de Dieu (Brésil), KARTHALA Editions, France, 2003, p. 46 In 1975, Macedo founded a Pentecostal church with Romildo Ribeiro Soares, Cruzada do Caminho Eterno. After an argument, the two separated. In 1977, Macedo founded with others the Universal Church of the Kingdom of God in Rio de Janeiro state, Brazil.Patrice de Plunkett, Les évangéliques à la conquête du monde, Éditions Perrin, France, 2009, p. 110 In 1989 he bought the free-to-air commercial television network RecordTV and in the same year he founded Grupo Record. In 2007 he founded the 24-hour free-to-air news channel Record News. His rapidly growing religious movement and his teaching of prosperity theology have been a source of controversy. His sermons partly focus on freeing his followers from unclean spirits that oppress them, which manifest in them, and are cast out in the name of Jesus, for them to overcome their problems. His views about other faiths, particularly Catholicism, are also controversial. In 1992 he spent eleven days in jail on accusations of charlatanism. There were several protests, with his religious followers camping in front of the police precinct he was held in, according to his autobiography \\"Nothing to Lose\\". His prosperity theology is used by church leaders to justify his lifestyle, \\"If I preach prosperity and my clothes are ragged, who will follow me?\\" From March 2013 to 2015, Macedo has been on the Forbes billionaires list with a reported US$1.1 billion, and $1.24 b for Macedo and family, making him by far the richest pastor in Brazil and the world. He was not on the list for 2016. The UCKG built a US$300 million replica of Solomon's Temple in São Paulo. Macedo and the UCKG have an $8 million contract to import stones from Israel like those used to build the temple in Israel. Personal life Macedo is married to Ester Bezerra, and has two daughters, Cristiane and Viviane, and an adopted son, Moises. Controversies =Opposition to interracial marriage= Macedo was criticized for writing an article opposing interracial marriage. He tried to justify his views claiming that multiracial children should be avoided because they will suffer discrimination. This led to several accusations of racism and misogyny. =Religious intolerance= Macedo has been criticised, especially after the 'kicking of the saint' incident in which UCKG bishop Sérgio Von Helder, who later left the Church, kicked a Catholic icon in a TV program, for which he was later imprisoned for two years. He also authored a book called Orixás, Caboclos and Guias in which he attacks Afro-Brazilian religion, accusing it of Satanism and \\"the root of all of Brazil's troubles\\". The book was first prohibited as hate speech, but after legal efforts from Macedo's church it was allowed for the sake of free speech. =Federal Justice indictment= Edir Macedo was indicted by the Federal Justice for import of equipment and use of public documents and legal proceedings, but not convicted. Ten years later he was prosecuted again by the prosecutors of the State of São Paulo. On October 19, 2010 the São Paulo Justice Court (TJ-SP) annulled all accusations made by the São Paulo Public Ministry against the UCKG and its principal representatives by a majority vote. The judges deemed that the São Paulo prosecutors did not have jurisdiction to investigate the case, as the accusations were of a type that fell into the federal jurisdiction.Universo Politico: Accusations against UCKG recognised as illegal, 24 October 2010 Companies Macedo also leads Rede Record (the second biggest television network in Brazil), Rede Família, Record News, Line Records, 64 radio stations of Rede Aleluia and Universal Produções. Books Ten million copies of evangelical books by Macedo have been sold, and over 34 titles published. Titles include Orixás, Caboclos and Guias and In the Footsteps of Jesus, both of which sold more than three million copies in Brazil. He has also sold his trilogy called Nada a perder (Nothing to lose), with millions of copies sold worldwide. He has written several religious books including the polemical best-seller Orixás, Caboclos e Guias, Deuses ou Demônios. Movies His broadcasting company Record financed the 2018 movie Nada a perder (Nothing to Lose) about Macedo's life, which is based on his autobiography.

The RMR consists of some 750 trained ranks distributed among the four units within the UK. About 10 percent of the force are working with the Regular Corps on long-term attachments in all of the Royal Marines regular units. All the volunteers within the RMR must pass through the same rigorous commando course as the regulars. The former may be civilians with no previous military experience or may be former regular Royal Marines. Mission The mission of the RMR is to act as a general reserve to the Royal Marines command and to promote a nationwide link between the military and civilian community. The official mission statement: * Reinforce the Royal Marines when required, with individuals and sub-units worldwide. * Promote a nationwide link between the Royal Marines and civilian communities. * Provide a nationwide infrastructure for strengthening and replacing the regular forces in times of national emergency. History The RMR can trace their roots back to the Royal Marines Forces Volunteer Reserve (RMFVR) formed in the Cities of London and Glasgow under the Royal Marines Act 1948. The RMFVR were officially formed on the 5 November 1948, at a ceremonial parade on the Honourable Artillery Company's Artillery Ground the same place the Royal Marines were formed on 28 October 1664. In the beginning, Reservists were chiefly former hostilities only (HO) personnel. They were mainly, but not solely, Royal Marines who had gained experience in World War II and trained in order to support the Corps against the threat from the Soviet Bloc. However, today the majority of Reservists have no previous military experience. Their transition from civilian to Marine, is therefore more challenging. Moreover, 21st century threats compel the training to be more comprehensive to equip the Marine with a variety of skills. The Reserves have adapted to these changes and remains flexible. Structure There are currently four Royal Marines Reserve units within the UK. These units are located throughout the country situated within or near major cities. Each of the main units acts as Headquarters for a number of smaller satellite detachments that spread out into the surrounding area to recruit locally in nearby population centers. As of the Summer 2013 following the restructuring (which saw the closure/amalgamation of certain RMR units and detachments), the current organisation of the RMR is as follows: *RMR Bristol, Dorset House, Bristol **Cardiff Detachment **Lympstone Detachment **Plymouth Detachment **Poole Detachment *RMR London, Royal Marines Barracks, Wandsworth **Oxford Detachment **Cambridge Detachment **Portsmouth Detachment *RMR Merseyside, Brunswick Dock, Liverpool **Birmingham Detachment **Leeds Detachment **Liverpool Detachment **Manchester Detachment **Nottingham Detachment *RMR Scotland (Rosyth), MoD Caledonia, Rosyth **Aberdeen Detachment **Belfast Detachment **Dundee Detachment **Edinburgh Detachment **Glasgow Detachment **Tyne (Newcastle) Detachment (Previously Tyne used to be its own RMR unit until its amalgamation with RMR Scotland.) Recruit training Over a period of 12–15 months, RMR recruits are required to attend training at their units, one evening a week and usually two weekends a month. In addition, when not training with the RMR they must work on their physical fitness in their own time. =Phase 1= Phase 1 lasts for at least 6 months and is the beginning of RMR basic training. It is designed to introduce recruits to the rudiments of individual skills and fieldcraft. Recruits must complete 6 Weekend training periods in addition to training for two hours for one evening a week. On completion of their phase 1 training, recruits are required to attend a 2-week course at the Commando Training Centre Royal Marines (CTCRM). Recruits wear the blue beret with red badge backing issued to RM personnel who have not passed the commando course. Basic fieldcraft - Instruction on how to fend for themselves under field conditions. This covers the construction of different types of shelters (\\"bivvies\\"), the use of the different types of ration pack, how to maintain themselves and their standards of hygiene under arduous conditions, camouflage and concealment. Navigation - Theoretical and practical aspects of finding their way over all types of terrain by day and night. Weapon training - Instruction on how to handle, maintain, strip and clean their 5.56 mm Rifle. Physical training - It is important from the outset, it is progressive and prepares recruits for Battle Physical Training (BPT) in Phase 2. Physical training periods concentrate on introducing and developing the techniques required for rope climbing, regains, fireman's carry and obstacle courses with an introduction to speed marching and load carries. However, it is necessary for recruits to continue fitness training in their own time in order to build their strength and endurance to the required level. Field exercises - Recruits are taught and tested on how they fend for themselves under field conditions, they soon learn that their comfort and survival in the field and on operations begins with good personal organisation and preparedness. To bring these points home there is usually an inspection every morning — the NCOs have an eagle eye for detail. Confirmation Course - This two-week course is designed as a test of the recruit's individual and physical skills. Recruits must pass at an acceptable and comparable level to his regular counterpart. The course also introduces the recruits to CTCRM and provides an insight into the conduct of the commando tests while assessing the skills learnt and practiced at his unit. =Phase 2= Phase 2 lasts for 8 to 10 months and is designed to equip recruits with the skills and knowledge required to act as a Marine in a Commando Unit, in addition to preparing them for the rigours of the Reserve Forces Commando Course. Physical training is now undertaken wearing personal load carrying equipment (PLCE/Fighting Order/Webbing). Throughout Phase 1 training, weight is gradually added to the Recruit's Fighting Order until it weighs the required during the Commando Course. In addition the recruits will carry their Rifle, weighing a further 10 lbs (4.5 kg). Battle Physical Training - BPT - Is designed to develop physical military skills, strength and endurance, whilst preparing recruits to withstand mental pressure. The BPT is designed to prepare Recruits for their BPT Pass Out and the Commando Course. Fieldcraft and tactics - The development and practise of the recruit's Individual and Fieldcraft skills continues. Tactical instruction begins with Basic Patrolling Techniques before moving onto Recce Patrols, Observation Posts, Fighting Patrols and Ambushes. Live field firing exercise - After passing the required build up packages at their units, recruits conduct a two-week field firing package conducted at CTCRM with a regular Troop. Recruits are introduced to realistic live firing exercises conducted on field firing areas. This reflects the progression from individual shooting on a simple range to a live firing troop attack involving 30 Marines. Amphibious exercise - Marines are taught the theory and drills associated with amphibious warfare. Practical training then takes place using a variety of offshore and inshore craft during day and night culminating in an amphibious exercise, where the Marines conduct amphibious raids from the sea. =Reserve Forces Commando Course= The RFCC is the culmination of all the recruits training. The course begins with the BPT (Battle Physical Training) Pass Out which consists of a 30 Foot Rope Climb, 200m Fireman's Carry, Assault Course and Full Regain. All this is undertaken carrying Full Fighting Order and Weapon. Successful recruits then progress onto the 12 Mile Loaded Carry and Four Day Field Exercise. Once passed, recruits are awarded the cap comforter and may continue onto the final element of the course, the commando tests. These commando tests consist of the Tarzan Assault Course, Endurance Course, 9 Mile Speed March and 30 Miler. On successful completion of the RFCC, at the end of the 30 Miler, the RMR recruits are awarded the coveted green beret. Life as a reservist RMR mountain training in Wales 2008 On earning their green beret following the completion of Phase 2 training, Marines join a 'Commando Company' within their RMR units. Marines must then undertake Phase 3 training, which consists of a course at CTCRM practising troop attack exercises and amphibious assaults. Only after completing this are Marines considered fully trained general duties rifleman, capable of serving with the regular corps. Marines go on to complete further training and operations with their commando company, and will eventually be able to specialise in a chosen trade. =Operations= Royal Marines Reservists have participated in almost all major modern operational deployments and conflicts that the regular marines have been deployed too, such as Operation Telic and Operation Herrick. In 2013 Royal Marines took part in exercises such exercise Black Alligator 13 in California, United States involving live firing exercises alongside their regular counterparts from 40 Commando. All trained ranks within the Royal Marines Reserve have the opportunity to serve in the Full Time Reserve Service with the regular Corps anywhere in the world, on exercise or operations. These periods can vary from 2 weeks up to 12 months. These opportunities are advertised within the RMR Units. It is estimated that up to 60% of all serving Reservists have served on combat operations, some doing tours of Afghanistan several times. RMR in the Lord Mayor's Show in the City of London, in 2007 =Further training= The purpose of the Marines Units Commando Company is to continue to expand and build on the Marine's individual and team skills through further training, in order for development. Within their RMR Units Marines will train so as to consolidate their basic soldiering skills such as weapon training, first aid, signals, nuclear biological chemical warfare, physical fitness, etc. In addition to this, Marines will also develop more advanced skills such as conducting amphibious raids and learning how to conduct operations in built up areas. Throughout each year Commando Company conduct a number of weekend exercises where they are given the opportunity to learn and develop new skills. For example, a unit live field firing exercise, where Marines would employ and practise weapon drills, marksmanship and troop tactics using live ammunition. =Specialist training= After a qualifying period as a general duties rifleman, Marines have the opportunity to specialise in a chosen trade. A number of these open to the Royal Marines Reservists are Assault Engineer, Landing Craft, Skills at Arms Instructor, Physical Training Instructor and Swimmer Canoeist. The majority of courses are abridged versions of those undertaken by regulars, courses usually last two to four weeks. Four-week courses are divided up into separate two-week packages. As reservists progress through the ranks in the RMR, they can attend further courses in their chosen specialisation that are of a more advanced nature (e.g.. LC3 - Marine; LC2 - Corporal; LC1 - Sergeant). However, many reservists are given the opportunity to attend the full courses undertaken by regulars if they are able to make the time available. =Notable members= In 2008, Royal Marine Reservist Lance Corporal Matthew Croucher received the George Cross for his actions whilst deployed with 40 Commando in Afghanistan. The incident occurred whilst on a reconnaissance patrol, when upon entering a compound he felt himself activate a grenade tripwire. L/Cpl Croucher deliberately fell onto the device aiming to protect his colleagues from the blast. He managed to cushion the majority of the blast with his Bergen whilst his body armour stopped further shrapnel, this left him with only minor injuries and his fellow Marines unharmed.

Although generally not considered to be the best in terms of sweetness and flavor, it is valued for its very long shelf life and tolerance of handling and transportation with little or no bruising or degradation. This means it is the main mango sold in regions where mangoes have to be imported, comprising about 80% of mangoes sold in the United Kingdom and United States, apart from growing regions in California, Hawaii, Florida and Jamaica. However, in France it is sold at a discount, while the main imported cultivar is Kent, Source of Sept 2009 consulted on 21/10/2011 considered less fibrous and tastier.  History  The original tree reportedly grew from a Haden seed planted around 1922 on the property of Thomas H. Atkins of Broward County, Florida. Later pedigree analysis supported the Haden parentage. Thomas Atkins submitted the fruit to the variety committee of the Florida Mango Forum multiple times during the 1950s, which rejected it due to its unremarkable eating qualities and considerable fiber in the flesh. Atkins, however, felt strongly that the fruit had good commercial potential due to its color, strong and steady production, relatively good fungus resistance, and good handling characteristics. He was able to market the fruit successfully to commercial growers, who began planting the cultivar during the 1950s. Thereafter, 'Tommy Atkins' became extremely popular as a commercial variety, eventually becoming the most commonly planted commercial mango in Florida, and later the most extensively planted in the Americas, a position it still holds today.

The words in formal and colloquial German and the different dialects for butterbrot (different from belegtes Brot - with cheese, sausages etc.), simply Brot (\\"bread\\"), Butterstulle, Stulle, Schnitte (all three Low German/Berlinerisch dialect), Botteramm (Colognian dialect, cf. Dutch boterham), Bütterken (Lower Rhine dialect) to Bemme (Upper Saxon German) or Knifte (Ruhrdeutsch). Although it is increasingly replaced by other foods, it remains a common staple food in Germany. Since 1999, the last Friday in the month of September was made the day of butterbrot by the Marketing Organization of German Agricultural Industries. Russian adopted the term buterbrod () from New High German (Butterbrot),Что такое БУТЕРБРОД - Этимологический русскоязычный словарь Фасмера - Словари - Словопедия perhaps as early as the 17th century during the reign of Peter the Great. In modern Russian the term has a more general meaning, whatever the ingredient on top of the slice of bread is. From Russian, the term buterbrod was adopted into Azerbaijani, Belarusian, Georgian, Kazakh, Ukrainian, and Lithuanian. Comparison with sandwiches Butterbrot with ham slices and bruschetta Salmon Roe buterbrod, typical Russian zakuski A Butterbrot is commonly a single slice of bread and one ingredient on top of the butter or margarine. For breakfast, this ingredient tends to be sweet and can be marmalade, jam, honey, chocolate spread, hazelnut spread, or the less common peanut butter. For dinner or as boxed lunch, and often also for breakfast, the Butterbrot is eaten with something savoury on top, usually a large slice of cold meat or cheese or sliced German Wurst, or one of the countless cream cheese varieties, or even an entire Schnitzel or halved mince meat patty, or hard boiled egg slices or egg salad, or other spreadable creamy salads, or smoked salmon, or various savoury spreads like liverwurst, including also a wide range of vegetarian spreads. Boxed lunch Butterbrot can be folded for easier handling, and as such remotely resembles the sandwich. In Austria Butterbrot only refers to a slice of bread with butter. If a topping is added it is named after the topping (e.g. Käsebrot \\"cheese bread\\", Wurstbrot \\"sausage bread\\"). Wurstbrot and Wurstbrötchen. The derivatives of the British sandwich and the Butterbrot of the German-speaking countries differ in some ways: The Butterbrot is usually made from the typical bread types of German-speaking countries, which are much firmer, juicier and fuller in taste, and with a crispy crust, compared to English sandwich slices. One popular type is Vollkornbrot (wholegrain bread), which has a sourish full savoury taste, due to the use of sourdough as a leavening agent, and which often contains rye, albeit bread made from wheat flour is usually the most common variety. Vollkornbrot exists in dozens of varieties with respect to taste, shape, color, etc. However Germans also know a large variety of white or mixed bread kinds, baguette or ciabatta are so common they are sold in every supermarket, and many modern German families simply eat toast with topping for breakfast, as it's cheaper and faster. Another very popular bread type is Brötchen (bread rolls), of which countless varieties exist in any possible shape, size and made from any possible flour combination. Some of the countless varieties of Brötchen in Germany The frequent claims that Germans would constantly eat hard and tasteless Graubrot and Schwarzbrot are likely urban legends, or prejudice, possibly originating from soldier tales during World War II. Especially since those kinds of bread are usually the strongest in sourdough flavour. Likely even more important are differences with respect to what is eaten on top of a Butterbrot or in a sandwich. Although exceptions exist, a Butterbrot is commonly not expanded the way sandwiches are. One slice of cheese and one or (in case of thin slices) maybe two slices of cold meat are commonly considered sufficient; adding lettuce, tomato, pickles, onions, mustard, mayonnaise etc. happens only following individual preferences. Also the ratio of bread and \\"topping\\" is relatively constant, thick fancy sandwich fillings have almost no equivalent for the Butterbrot. German speakers differentiate between the German-style Butterbrot and the British-style sandwich by using the English word \\"sandwich\\" for the latter. As a conclusion one may say that the Butterbrot is a type of open faced sandwich, using well made savoury bread slices, and with simpler straightforward toppings. However one of the reasons why the Germans prefer just butter and simpler toppings is because they take such pride in the quality and taste of their breads. Present-day use In German-speaking countries, the butterbrot has been displaced gradually in the last 40 years by muesli, breakfast cereals or toast for breakfast and take-away bakery products during daytime. Nonetheless, it remains a common staple food among many Germans. In addition it remains popular in the evening. It is also eaten a lot on hiking trips. In many parts of Germany the butterbrot is still very common for second breakfast at school or work (much more often eaten than, for example, fast food). Usually in September every year, the Central Marketing Society for German Agriculture (CMA, the agricultural industry's now-defunct lobby group) used to declare a \\"day of the German Butterbrot\\". The 8th Butterbrot day's motto in 2006 was: \\"Re-Experience Enjoyment\\". The celebration was one of many \\"Days of...\\" and not very well known in Germany. In Russia, Ukraine, Belarus and other former Soviet republics, buterbrod hasn't experienced any decline and remains a common staple of food. It is usually distinguished from sandwiches. In the Russian language, the term сэндвич (sandwich) hasn't been russified to the same degree and hasn't been in use as long as buterbrod, and usually sandwich is only used for two slices of bread with some ingredient in between, especially sandwiches made in fastfood chains and restaurants. Urban legends Butterbrot is said to always fall to the floor (and especially on carpet) with the buttered side downwards; an example of Murphy's law. A common explanation is that the top side is usually heavier than the bottom side, particularly if the bread has additional toppings such as Nutella or jam. Another is tied to the common height of tables. The subject has been researched by various sources, including the German children's series Die Sendung mit der Maus, and the scientific German TV series Quarks & Co. It is often joked about what would happen if you tie a butterbrot to the back of a cat, in the same manner that hypothetical buttered toast attached to the back of a cat is sometimes joked about, with it being debated whether the feline would still honour the popular axiom, that a cat \\"always lands on its feet\\", or if the butterbrot would be \\"stronger\\", making the cat fall on its back — alternatively, it is sometimes humorously suggested that the cat would simply levitate, as it would be unable to satisfy both criteria for landing.

It was published in 1933. In this story, the third set of major characters in the series, the Ds — Dick and Dorothea Callum—are introduced. The series' usual emphasis on boats and sailing is largely absent, as the story is set in the winter. Instead, the children's activities focus on ice skating, signalling with semaphore and Morse code, and sledging. Ransome draws on his schoolday memories of the Great Frost of 1895 when Windermere froze completely. Another major influence is Fridtjof Nansen's books about his crossing of Greenland in 1888 and his Arctic expedition from 1893–1896 in the Fram and by sledge, which are extensively referenced in the novel. Plot summary Brother and sister Dick and Dorothea Callum meet the Swallows and Amazons during the winter beside the lake. Whilst observing the stars from an isolated barn, Dick and Dorothea encounter the other children and shortly become firm friends. They become part of the group, and join in their play of Arctic expeditions. The holiday is extended when leader Nancy Blackett catches mumps and the group is quarantined and cannot return to their boarding schools. Initially, while waiting for snow to fall, the children embark on a series of adventures ranging from rebuilding an igloo to building an ice sled. Dick displays heroism by rescuing a sheep belonging to Farmer Dixon stranded on an ice-covered ledge, thus gaining his gratitude and earning them a sledge of their own. There is a heavy snowfall followed by a prolonged period of freezing weather and, unusually, the lake freezes over, providing an excellent opportunity for an expedition to the point at the head of the lake that they have named the \\"North Pole\\". However, plans go awry when the Ds set out earlier than expected due to a misunderstanding over a signal flag. When a blizzard blows up and the Ds are missing, a rescue party is organised consisting of the Swallows and Peggy, one of the Amazons.

Mission Support the Marine Air Ground Task Force (MAGTF) commander by providing tactical mobility and logistical support for the MAGTF, day or night, in all weather conditions. VMM-266 does this by conducting mission essential tasks, which include shipboard operations, sea and air deployment operations, air assault, amphibious assaults and raids, distribution of supplies and other transport services, joint personnel recovery, and conduct of noncombatant evacuation. History =The Early years= HMM-266 was activated on April 26, 1983 at Marine Corps Air Station (MCAS) New River, North Carolina. In its first year, the squadron established a foundation that would make it the cold weather assault support experts for 2nd MAW. Over the course of the next six years, the squadron participated in fourteen exercises from the High Sierras of the Mountain Warfare Training Center (MWTC) in Bridgeport, California to the arctic climes of northern Norway. =The Gulf War and the 1990s= Following the invasion of Kuwait in August 1990, HMM-266 initially provided aircraft and personnel to other MAG-26 squadrons as they prepared for deployment. On December 31, 1990, HMM-266 became the first CH-46E squadron from II Marine Expeditionary Force (II MEF) to deploy to Southwest Asia (SWA). On January 4, 1991, the squadron arrived in Jubail, Saudi Arabia, and provided assault support in the form of Tactical Recovery of Aircraft and Personnel (TRAP), troop movement, casualty evacuation (CASEVAC), and re-supply missions. The squadron moved to Combat Outpost Lonesome Dove with the rest of MAG-26 for Operation Desert Storm and conducted combat support from this location until offensive operations ceased on February 28, 1991. In May, the Fighting Griffins were the last MAG-26 squadron to return to MCAS New River. In 1992, while off the coast off Italy, the CH-46s of HMM-266 (Rein) made worldwide news. They provided heavy lift support when Mount Etna erupted and lava flow threatened to wipe out the town of Zafferana, Sicily. In February - March 1994, the squadron supported Operation Continue Hope and Operation Quick Draw in Somalia. After successfully completing these operations, the Fighting Griffins proceeded to the Adriatic Sea in support of Operation Provide Promise and Operation Deny Flight. HMM-266 (Rein) returned to MCAS New River on 23 June, and ten days later was recalled to deploy to the Caribbean in support of Operation Support Democracy in Haiti. The squadron deployed in November 1998 and immediately detached three CH-46Es and its two UH-1Ns to conduct contingency operations off the coast of Albania concurrent with Operation Silver Knight. HMM-266 aircraft on flightline at Al Asad as seen on NVGs In March 1999, the Fighting Griffins were designated the TRAP stand-by force in support of Operation Allied Force and Joint Task Force (JTF) Noble Anvil strike missions into Serbia. Upon arriving on station, the Combined Air Operations Center (CAOC) assigned the aviation combat element (ACE) AV-8Bs six excess combat strike sorties per day. The AV-8Bs flew their first combat sortie on April 14 with strike missions into Kosovo. A total of thirty four combat sorties and 65.3 combat hours were flown in support of Operation Allied Force/JTF Noble Anvil. In addition to AV-8B strike missions, two CH-46Es successfully extracted a Navy Special Warfare Team Personal Security Force from Petrovic, Macedonia. =Global War on Terror= HMM-266 Squadron Photo taken November 1, 2005 at Al-Asad Iraq In February 2004, the HMM-266 (Rein) boarded the USS Wasp and sailed east for the Mediterranean Sea.

On December 23, 2008, he was shot and killed by police officers responding to a hostage situation in El Monte, California. Early life and acting career Manuel Benitez was the illegitimate son of the internationally famous bullfighter Manuel Benitez, known as \\"El Cordobés\\" (not to be confused with the younger bullfighter with the same name who claimed to be El Cordobés' illegitimate son-known in bullfighting circles as \\"The Pretender\\"). Spanish paparazzi followed the real El Cordobés and Benitez's mother, Alina Elizabeth Velasco throughout the world as they partied through the 1970s. Their relationship ended in a bitter five-year court dispute, with Velasco moving to Los Angeles to hire the famous palimony lawyer Marvin Mitchelson to seek support for her and her son who seemed a natural in Hollywood. Benitez was nine years old when he began his acting career. His early roles in Hollywood were guided by child agent, Iris Burton. He was fairly successful, starring in commercials, TV shows and movies. His roles included parts in Be Somebody... or Be Somebody's Fool!, Pee-wee's Big Adventure and Stand and Deliver. He also appeared in the TV shows Galactica 1980 and Highway to Heaven. Life after acting career Benitez had no major acting work since 1988 when he met Stephanie Spears in 1996. The two moved in together and had one child, Benjamin Everett. Benitez never told Spears or anyone else about his former days as a child actor. According to the FBI, Benitez sold drugs to supplement the money he made doing odd jobs. Benitez was arrested on drug charges in 2000 and convicted for possession of a concealed and illegal loaded firearm in his son's stroller in 2003 and was sentenced to probation. Murder of Stephanie Spears His girlfriend eventually decided to end their relationship. On the night of June 20, 2004, Benitez tried to leave with their son while Spears was asleep. After she woke up and tried to stop him, an argument ensued. Benitez allegedly beat her numerous times with a dumbbell, killing her in front of their three-year-old child before fleeing their Hawthorne, California home with him. Benitez and his son Benjamin were believed to be traveling with his mother, Alina Elizabeth Velasco, who disappeared after Spears' murder. They were sighted in the Medford, Oregon area in December 2004. On May 11, 2005, a state warrant was issued by the Superior Court of California, County of Los Angeles, for Benitez's arrest after he was charged with murder. Benitez was charged federally with unlawful flight to avoid prosecution and an arrest warrant was issued by the United States District Court, Central District of California, on March 21, 2006. The FBI was offering a reward of up to $20,000 for information leading to the arrest of Benitez. He was featured on America's Most Wanted several times. El Monte restaurant standoff and death On December 23, 2008, police received a call about a suspicious man with a child. A police officer and witnesses noticed a man taking a boy off the sidewalk and then go into a restaurant in El Monte, California. Soon after that, a hostage standoff ensued and Benitez ignored the officers' orders to stop and barricaded himself inside the restaurant bathroom with his son. Benitez told police during negotiations that he was going to shoot police and harm his seven-year-old son whom he held hostage for two hours. One employee of a nearby Mexican restaurant said Benitez had the boy in a headlock and held a gun to his head as he sought a place to hold him. Police closed nearby streets, and shoppers were evacuated from neighboring stores as dozens of police officers and other emergency crews surrounded the restaurant. Police threw a flash-bang grenade inside and exchanged gunfire with Benitez, killing him. Benitez was declared dead at the Chinese restaurant in an El Monte strip mall. His son was shot in the thigh but survived. Benitez was later found to have a semi-automatic pistol and a revolver. Alina Elizabeth Velasco has not been located.

Life Jack Cope was born in Natal, South Africa and home-schooled by tutors. From the age of 12, he boarded at Durban High School in Durban, afterwards becoming a journalist on Natal Mercury and then a political correspondent in London for South African newspapers. At the outbreak of the Second World War, in a state of some disillusionment, he returned to South Africa. He moved to Cape Town, where he worked for the Marxist Guardian newspaper from 1941 to 1955, in various capacities including cultural critic and, at one stage, general editor. For many years, Cope was sympathetic to Communism and the Soviet Union. His Communist stmpathies ended, however, with disillusionment after the revelation of Joseph Stalin's crimes in Nikita Khrushchev's Secret Speech. He married his second cousin, the artist Lesley De Villiers in 1942. They separated in 1958 and were divorced in the early 1960s. They had two sons, Raymond, (1948–1977) and Michael (born 1952). Jack Cope is well known for his romantic attachment (ca. 1960-1964) to Afrikaans language poet Ingrid Jonker, who is known as South Africa's answer to Sylvia Plath. After Jonker committed suicide in 1965, Cope edited a posthumous anthology of her last poems and translated a selection of them into English. Fiction Cope published eight novels, more than a hundred short stories, and three collections of poetry, the last one in association with C.J. Driver. For twenty years, beginning in 1960, he edited Contrast, a literary magazine bilingual in English and Afrikaans. He co-edited The Penguin Book of South African Verse (1968) with Uys Krige and, as general editor throughout much of the 1970s, produced the Mantis editions of Southern African poets. In 1980 he moved to England, where he published The Adversary Within: Dissident Writers in Afrikaans (1982) and his Selected Stories (1986). Cope's first novel, The Fair House (1955), considers the Bambata Rebellion of 1906 in an attempt to account for the later racial and political conditions in South Africa. Later novels, including The Golden Oriole (1958), Albino (1964), and The Rain-Maker (1971), chronicle the white man's destruction of black culture and the ensuing struggle by the blacks to regain their pride and identity. However, it is as a short-story writer that Cope demonstrated his finest talent. His stories evoke, according to Alan Paton, 'with a few words the scents and sounds and colours of our country'. In A Crack in the Sky (The Tame Ox, 1960) and 'Power' (The Man Who Doubted and Other Stories, 1967) his moral vision is clear; his third collection, Alley Cat and Other Stories (1973), contains darker themes such as those of alienation and loneliness. Among Cope's main achievements was his influence on South African literature during the 1960s and 1970s, important years in the struggle against apartheid. In popular culture The 2011 film Black Butterflies tells the story of the relationship between Ingrid Jonker and Jack Cope, who is portrayed onscreen by Irish actor Liam Cunningham.

One of Doctor Dream Records most popular bands, the Swamp Zombies released five albums for the label. The core of their sound blended folk music and punk music with heavy doses of calypso and other influences thrown into the mix. The video for the song \\"Creeps\\" (Scratch and Sniff Car Crash) received airplay on MTV's 120 Minutes. Brief history The band was initially formed in 1985 in Irvine, CA, by two pairs of brothers, Josh and Travis Agle, and Steve and Mike Jacobs. Mike played percussion (congas) on the first single, Fire and Dogs, then was replaced by Gary McNiece, who also performed on the first album. After Gary left, a session musician laid down percussion tracks for their second album until Dave Warren stepped in to fill the void. After the third album Travis left the group and was replaced on the next album by t-ray Vogelzang, who came from a band called The Final Tourguides and also the thrash-a-bash art punk band, The Silly Millions. After t-ray departed for San Francisco, the band continued as a three piece with Travis making appearances at the odd live show in their later years. The most recent Swamp Zombies gig appears to have taken place in August 1997. Members of the Swamp Zombies found themselves in splinter and spinoff bands such as The Tiki Tones, The Huntington Cads, The Calypso Cats, Tombstone Bullets, and Trucker Up. As of April 2007, a documentary film is being made which will chronicle the history of the Swamp Zombies with recent interviews with band members and those associated with the band.

It was part of the old Neath Rural district Council under Glamorgan until 1974. The village then came under the jurisdiction of The Cynon Valley Borough which subsequently became Rhondda Cynon Taf, South Wales in 1996. It lies just off the old Aberdare road that was the main link between Aberdare and Glyn Neath, before the A465 road was extended in the 1960s. The hamlets of Cefn Rhigos and Cwm-Hwnt lie to the west of the main village.Rhigos village and Tower Colliery as viewed from the Rhigos Mountain viewpoint. The population of the community in the 2011 census was noted as 894. For postal purposes it comes under the town of Aberdare, although it is some from Aberdare town centre, and from Glyn Neath. It was noted as a township in the parrish of Ystradyfodwg in several historical references and people moved to this rural area to work in local industries. Today, the village is a quiet place to live with stunning views of the Brecon Beacons and is within walking distance of The famous Waterfall country. Etymology The name Rhigos is an erroneous standardisation of the local dialect form of Ricos. According to Welsh toponomy, the place-names of Wales derive in most cases from the Welsh language, but have also been influenced by linguistic contact with English, French, Irish, Flemish, Latin, Norse and British or Brittonic. . A rule of thumb for writing Welsh place names is that they should be spelled according to the standard language and not the local dialect form (though there are many instances of names showing local traits rather than a standard version - Machynlleth for Machynllaith, Caerdydd for Caerdyf etc. An initial 'c' in a final syllable in the Gwentian - Gwenhwyseg dialect is often a devoiced form of 'g', and such is the case here. An initial 'r' is generally a deaspirated 'rh' in the dialect, but this is not the case here. Since in South Wales 'u' and 'i' no longer represent different vowel sounds (though in North Wales these spellings DO show different vowels) in spelling 'i' might be used instead of the historically correct spelling with 'u'. In this way 'Rhigos' has come about, though in fact it is, from its earlier spellings, quite evidently from 'grugos' (small clumps of heather - 'grug' is heather and '-os' is a diminutive suffix found in place names after words denoting vegetation, and in the modern language it is to seen in 'plantos' = little children). The 'correct' form of the name is 'Y Rugos', a name found in other parts of Wales (also as Y Grugos). Geography and Natural History \\"The south Wales Valleys support a treasure trove of biodiversity. Like all good treasure troves it had been lost and long forgotten and has only now been re-found, and like some giant archaeological dig, one discovery has led to another; one find has spurred on the finding of the next.\\" Rhigos lies at the apex of the Cynon Valley and the Vale of Neath and Rhigos Mountain, Craig y llyn, is the highest peak in the Glamorgan. The Llyn Fawr lies beneath the Pennant Sandstone scarp of Craig y Llyn which is evidence of the effect of the Ice Age on the landscape. The glaciers sculpted and overdeepened the valleys into characteristic U-shaped profiles, and most of the north Wales examples, such as the Llanberis, Nant Ffrancon and Conwy valleys, display successive rock basins in their longitudinal profile.The long, southerly directed, dip-slope feature of the Fans and Brecon Beacons fed ice across the uplands and valleys of the coalfield, although a small ice cap across Craig y Llyn fed ice into the Neath and Cynon valleys on its north side. All the deposits of the Welsh ice were locally derived. An important historical find was made at Llyn Fawr between 1909 and 1913 which was called 'The Llyn Fawr Hoard' . According to the National Museum of Wales, The Llyn Fawr hoard is extremely important because it illustrates the cross over between the Bronze and Iron Ages. It is unusual because of the mixed styles of objects that suggest a wide range of origins. Indeed on the British scale the name Llyn Fawr is given to the period of time dating from 750-600BC. These precious and unique items can be found in The National Museum and Galleries of Wales. The landscape of the area surrounding Rhigos has been noted as sites of special scientific interest These are areas such as the famous Waterfall Country, Cwm Cadlan and nearby Blaencynon SAC. The Joint Nature Conservation Committee which advises the government and devolved administrationson UK-wide and International nature conservation states that the damp grassland and heath of the Blaencynon site has been noted as an area that supports the Marsh Fritilliary Butterfly. This butterfly is threatened not only in the UK, but across Europe. which makes this area important partner in an international conservation effort. Industrial History Originally farmland until the late 1700s, the village developed in the Industrial Revolution through the mineral industry, extracting coal, iron ore and limestone. What is believed to be the first coke fired furnace was built on nearby land by John Mayberry o Brecon in 1757. It came into the possession of the Crawshay family in 1819, which provided much employment until the early 1830s. Francis Crawshay famously built a folly on nearby land and was apparently the only member of the family to speak Welsh. The site was then taken over by the Gloucester Railway Carriage and Wagon Company which ran until the 1930s. British Rhondda Colliery, later called \\"The Pandy\\" and finally Rhigos Colliery was opened during the 1920s. This was a drift mine, and it closed in 1965.Thomas, Michael: \\"The Death of an Industry\\", page 93. Colben system PTE. Ltd, 2004 Coal was extracted from land near Rhigos in 1864 from a drift mine called Tower Graig. This mine is noted to have been discontinued, but there are records that 420 men were employed by The Marquess of Bute to extract coal from Tower Colliery around the 1890s. The Tower Colliery and was famously the subject of a worker's buy-out closed in 2008 and its closure saw the last of the deep mines in Wales come to an end. However, Tyrone O'Sullivan who was part of the worker buy out, spoke about the possibility of the land being regenerated in the future. Indeed, in 2019 RCT Council announced that planning had been unanimously granted for Zipline Cymru to construct of a new line at the Tower site which will be the focus for the development of tourism in the area. = Hirwaun Industrial Estate = During the Second World War, those not within the colliery industry, and hence in reserved employment, could find similar work at ROF Hirwaun, which was actually sited within Rhigos parish where the present day Industrial Estate is located. Developed by Royal Ordnance Factory and the Ministry of War from 1942 as an offshoot of ROF Newport, it was an engineering ROF producing .303 cartridge cases for Lee–Enfield rifles, and 9mm cartridge cases, which were then shipped to be filled at a Filling ROF. Having built three new roads and associated bungalows to house the workers, all raw materials were shipped in via the former Vale of Neath Railway by the Great Western Railway, using the sidings of the former Tir Herbert brickworks. Day-workers would alight at Rhigos railway station, beyond which were built additional sidings to house the railway carriages that were shipping workers to the site from all over the South Wales valleys. The site of the ROF was discovered by the German military, who ordered a single air raid by the Nazi Luftwaffe in 1943. At the end of the war, the site was abandoned, and the factory was only demolished in the late 1960s. A range of other businesses then took over the Industrial Estate and further details about these can be found in the W.W Price Collection at Aberdare Library. Sport and leisure Rhigos Community Sports Hall One of the village's social hubs is the Rhigos RFC club house. The rugby union team play in Division Five, South Central of the Welsh Rugby pyramid. Rhigos Sports Hall is a volunteer run facility, and is located adjacent to the rugby club. It provides a range of indoor sporting facilities to Rhigos and the surrounding areas. The Rhigos WCKA Kickboxing Club meet in the hall each week and is part of the Welsh Contact Karate Association. Members of the club were part of the Wales team who attended the World Kickboxing Championships 2018 in Greece. The Vale of Neath Gliding Club operates from a grass airfield for gliding close to the village.http://valeofneathglidingclub.bravehost.com/index.html Vale of Neath Gliding Club where tuition can be given under the guidance of British Gliding Association qualified instructors. The Rhigos mountain is also a popular spot for paragliders due to the excellent thermal conditions and stunning views. Cyclists are also often found in and around Rhigos. The route up the mountain forms part of competitions and meets for clubs from all over the UK, such as the Junior Tour of Wales and is considered to be a scenic but particularly challenging climb. It has been quoted as being one of the most beautiful and challenging ascents in the whole of Wales. Transport In 1850 the Vale of Neath Railway opened its line between and via , completing its mainline to from Hirwaun in 1853. Rhigos Halt consisted of two platforms and was sited at the north end of the 520 yard long Pencaedrain Tunnel. Brown's engineering sidings were additionally built to house permanent way vehicles that were maintaining the railway tracks. The climb from to Rhigos involved the steep Glynneath embankment, which required all north-bound trains to take on a banker locomotive at Glynneath station, which was released at Rhigos. After the railway was closed under the Beeching Axe, the council took the opportunity to provide a better road link between Hirwaun and Glynneath, and so bypassed the old Aberdare road by building an extension to A465 road which utilised most of the trackbed of the abandoned railway. The road has now been identified by the government as being in need of improvement due to restricted traffic flow and poor visibility. The current plans in place are stated by the government to be completed by 2024. 'The Parrish Road' was another access to the village which was closed when Celtic Energy opened a controversial opencast mine between Rhigos and Cwmgwrach in 1997. The promise was made to reinstate the road after the mine closed, and talks have been held between residents, Celtic Energy and Neath Port Talbot County Council during 2020.  Notable people  Professor Kevin Morgan of Cardiff University was born and raised in Rhigos. He is Professor of Governance and Development and lectures on subjects such as poverty, deprivation and social immobility. Professor Morgan is also a member of OECD that is reviewing multilevel governance in Wales. Gweirydd (Dai) Walters founded the Walters Group of Civil Engineers in 1982. The company's HQ is on the nearby Industrial Estate and has branches throughout Wales and the West. Gweirydd (Dai) Walters was named one of the richest people in Wales in 2019. Rhigos has produced some international rugby players, most notably Dai Morris, who played for Rhigos RFC and Neath RFC. He won 34 caps for Wales as a flanker during the \\"Second Golden Era\\" of Welsh rugby in the 1970s, and dual rugby union/rugby league international Glyn Shaw. Rhigos resident Mrs C. Ann Jenkins served as High Sheriff of Mid Glamorgan for the years 2012/13. High Sheriffs are Royally appointed for one year. It is a non-political position and originates in Saxon times. High Sheriffs actively lend support to crime prevention agencies, the emergency services and voluntary sector. Present Day There is one convenience store located on Heol Pendarren, which opened its doors under new management in March 2020. There are also two pubs located within Rhigos: \\"The Plough\\" and \\"The New Inn\\" as well as the rugby club. \\"The New Inn\\" is popular as a place to drink, socialise and eat.There is a small children's playground and views over the fields towards the Rhigos mountain. Rhigos Primary is the village school. The original building was built in the Victorian style in 1876 and is located on Heol y Graig. The majority of pupils from the school subsequently attend Aberdare Community School or St John The Baptist High School in Landare. Welsh medium education is available for pupils at Ysgol Gynradd Penderyn situated in the nearby village of Pontpren, Penderyn and then at secondary level at Ysgol Gyfun Rhydywaun. The nearest Catholic primary school is St Margaret's Primary. The original Rhigos school building was built in the Victorian style in 1876. Prior to the building of the school classes were held in rooms provided by R Crawshay esq, first mentioned in the journals of William Roberts (Nefydd) in 1856. He states how the school was funded by the colliers and miners of Rhigos, who each contributed 1d of each pound of their wages to support a master whose salary was £40. There is a Voluntary Society in Rhigos who organise a carnival for the village in the summer. They also take local children to see the pantomime in Aberdare Coliseum at Christmas and ensure that 'Santa' visits each street handing out goodies for little ones.

It was the first of the armoured divisions of the French Cavalry. Formation Preparations to create such a unit began in 1931. Slowly the 4th Cavalry Division was mechanised. =Name= In July 1935, the mechanised components, though still not fully equipped, were given a separate identity, while confusingly 4th Cavalry continued to exist, giving the false impression the armoured division was a completely new force. The name of the unit is most often translated as \\"Light Mechanized Division\\", but a better translation, both from a linguistic as military point of view, would be \\"Mechanized Light Division\\". In French the adjective mécanique qualifies légère, not the other way around. In French military parlance, light troops were those that engaged in scouting and skirmishing, and the distinction traditionally applied to both cavalry and infantry arms. A mechanized light division was therefore one designed for this role but using modern motorized and armored equipment to perform it. Some motorised infantry divisions without tracked vehicles would also be called \\"light divisions\\". =Organisation= Another confusion often caused by the category indication is the mistake to assume that such units were \\"lightly\\" equipped: in fact most heavy equipment was concentrated into the motorised units which represented the most powerful in the French Army. The 1re DLM used the AMR 35 as a light skirmisher and the Somua S-35 and Hotchkiss H35 as main battle tanks, though the latter vehicle was not really suited for this role as its armament was too weak. The artillery and infantry components were fully motorised; part of the organic infantry was also mechanised, using half-tracks. In organisation a DLM closely resembled the contemporaneous German Panzerdivision of the Panzerwaffe, though it would be more \\"tank-heavy\\", not so much the Leichte Kavalleriedivisionen of the German Cavalry, which units in the thirties were only partly mechanised.

It is neighboured by the villages of Blaenllechau, Ferndale, Penrhys, Pontygwaith and Stanleytown. History By the mid 19th century, the potential wealth of the South Wales Coalfield was unapparent to many, but provided great opportunities to those with the resources and knowledge to exploit it. London geologist Alfred Tylor came to the area and purchased the mineral rights from Pendyrus Farm in 1872. Tylor soon opened Pendyrys Colliery on the site. The Colliery workers and their families were housed near the colliery on the former farmland, this area retained its name in Welsh (Pendyrus) but would come to be known as Tylor's Town in English. In January 1896, 57 miners were killed by an underground explosion in the Tylorstown pits, newly taken over by the Ferndale Colliery; the blast was so powerful it blew the winding gear off the top of the pitshaft. Research on the causes of the fatalities in the Tylorstown disaster conducted by Prof John Scott Haldane was instrumental in the introduction of canaries to detect the presence of carbon monoxide in mines. The last working mine in the village closed in the 1960s setting off a long period of economic decline which worsened following the 1984–85 national miners' strike which resulted in pits in nearby locations such as Maerdy closing. The local passenger train line closed in 1964 following the Beeching Axe which also limited the prospects of easy commuting to Cardiff. In December 2006, the Rhondda by-pass, also known as the Porth relief road, opened. It terminates at neighbouring Pontygwaith due to the topography of the Rhondda Fach, which is a narrow valley with steep sides and limited flat land on the valley floor. The new road cost £98 million, included the construction or replacement of 11 bridges, including the Rheola Bridge. An engineering success, the road has done much to reduce traffic congestion and improve local economic prospects. Landmarks The Welfare Hall was built in 1933 from red brick and stone in the French Baroque style. It is the last remaining miners' institute in the Rhondda Valley, and is now run as a community hub putting on shows, classes and a coffee shop by volunteers. In 2017 it was awarded £500,000 to renovate the building. The Holy Trinity Church, situated on a mound above the main road was built in 1882-3 by E.M. Bruce Vaughan. It features a five-light plate traceried west window and a stained glass window of Christ in Majesty made by monks of Prinknash Abbey in around 1980. There is a monument to Reverend John Rees who died in 1913. There is also a Conservative Club. The cemetery, situated half way up the hill to Penrhys features a chapel built in 1884 by W.H. Jenkins and T.R. Phillips. Governance The Tylorstown electoral ward is coterminous with the borders of the Tylorstown community and elects two county councillors to Rhondda Cynon Taf County Borough Council. Since 1995 representation has mainly been by the Labour Party but the ward had a Plaid Cymru councillor from 1999 to 2004.Rhondda Cyon Taff County Borough Council Election Results 1995-2012, The Election Centre. Retrieved 26 October 2018. A 2018 review of electoral arrangements by the Local Democracy and Boundary Commission for Wales would see Tylorstown merged with neighbouring Ynyshir. The proposals would take effect from the 2022 council elections. Sport Tylorstown has a rugby union team called Tylorstown Tigers. The club produced a British and Irish Lions rugby union player John Bevan who toured New Zealand in 1971 with the only Lions side to win a series in that country. The club also has a very successful women's side the Tigresses who won the Welsh national women's cup in season 2005 to 2006 and were runners up in the national league. The women's side has provided many internationals to the Wales women's team. The club has also supplied an international and first class rugby coach in Lyn Howells. The village was also home to world boxing champion Jimmy Wilde, the \\"ghost with a hammer in his hand\\". Appearances in popular culture Some scenes for the Sky TV comedy Stella were filmed in Tylorstown, and an aerial view of the village appears in the title sequence.

Championship systems  Various forms of competition can be referred to by the term championship. = Title match system = In this system, a competitor has to challenge the current champion to win the championship. A competitor (called number 1 contender) can challenge the current champion after defeating other challengers. This form of championship is used in individual head-to-head competitions and is particularly associated with combat sports such as wrestling, boxing and mixed martial arts. = Tournament system = The term championships (in the plural) is often used to refer to tournament competitions, either using a knockout format, such as at Wimbledon and other championships in tennis, or a mixed format with a group stage followed by knockout rounds, such as used in the European Football Championships. A variation of the knockout format is the \\"best-of-X\\" or series format where two teams face each other for a specified number of times until one team wins the majority of specified games, most of the time the remaining games are not played anymore; only then is the losing team eliminated from contention and the winning team advances to the next level. This format is predominant in American sports such as baseball, ice hockey and basketball, and on test cricket. = League system = Championships in various sports, including rugby union and soccer use a league system in which all competitors in the league play each other, either once or a number of times. This is also known as a round robin system. =Hybrid systems= Some competitions use a hybrid system that combines traits of two or more of these systems. Tournament of Champions system The game show Jeopardy! uses a title match system during regular play, then holds a Tournament of Champions with the longest-running champions under the title match system that operates on a tournament system to determine that season's \\"Grand Champion.\\" This type of system works best in competitions with numerous competitions in a short period of time (game shows such as Jeopardy!, in particular, fit this description, since there are five new title matches every week). Playoff system In many sport leagues, a playoff system is used to determine a championship winner. Teams compete in a regular season of varying formats and a limited number of teams qualify for playoffs. Although this system is mostly identified with the United States and Canada, it is frequently found in other North American countries, and is also standard in sports influenced by North America (e.g. basketball, baseball, ice hockey) as well as most football codes other than soccer. The playoffs (known in some countries, notably Australia, as the \\"finals series\\") are a tournament where teams play head-to-head in knockout competition. The championship is often considered the final of the playoffs (e.g., Super Bowl, Stanley Cup Final, NBA Finals, World Series, etc.). The playoff system can be seen as a hybrid between the league system and tournament system, where a league is used to determine qualifiers for the tournament. In the NFL, the term \\"Championship game\\" is used to refer to the matches which decide the champions of each of the two conferences, the NFC (NFC Championship Game) and AFC (AFC Championship Game). These games are effectively semi-finals as they determine the two competitors in the Super Bowl. The quirk in naming stems from when the NFC and AFC were separate leagues (see: American Football League) with a respective NFL Championship and AFL Championship, the winners of which would in the AFL's later years meet in the World Championship, now known as the Super Bowl.  English football  In English football, since the 2004–05 season, the Championship has been used to refer to the second level of league football (now properly called the EFL Championship). The Championship is one division below the Premier League and a division above EFL League One. It had previously been known as Football League One and the Football League First Division.

David was the nephew of legendary film director Sam Peckinpah and son of Denver \\"Denny\\" Peckinpah, a Fresno County Superior Court Judge. He was the writer and producer of several series including the cable TV shows DEA, Silk Stalkings, Sliders and Beauty and the Beast. He also had a number of series in development at the time of his death. Sliders Fox brought Peckinpah onto the television series Sliders in its third season. Peckinpah has been derided by fans, who argue that his involvement (and by extension Fox's more hands-on involvement) caused the show to \\"jump the shark\\". Peckinpah is believed to be responsible for the departure of cast member John Rhys-Davies. While John Rhys-Davies had been an outspoken critic of the show's writing quality since the first season, Fox supported him; only David Peckinpah, who was assigned to the show in its third season, wanted him out. Rhys-Davies later vowed that he would not return to Sliders as long as Peckinpah had a hand in the show. Sliders co-creator Tracy Tormé was highly critical of Sliders in its third season. When the show was cancelled and the show was picked up by the Sci-Fi Channel, Tormé attempted to retake control of the series. One of Tormé's conditions was the removal of David Peckinpah from the series. Peckinpah had already signed a two-year contract with Universal, and Universal elected to keep Peckinpah. Tormé left the series. Personal life David was married to actress and producer Sandy Peckinpah from 1974 until his death in 2006. They had four children: Garrett (b. 1978 d. 1994), Trevor (born 1982), Julianne Belle (born 1988), and Jackson (born 1992). Julianne was born with a bilateral cleft lip, which inspired David's wife to write books about children born with special needs. Some books are \\"Rosey the Imperfect Angel,\\" \\"Chester the Imperfect All-Star\\" (inspired by baseball pitcher Jim Abbott), and \\"Fairy Tale Life . . . Interrupted.\\" David and Sandy were writing partners and co-founders of DASAN Productions. The couple were very close friends with actors Melissa Gilbert and Bruce Boxleitner. Melissa gave birth to a very premature son in October 1994. She named him Michael Garrett Boxleitner (in honor of Michael Landon and Garrett Peckinpah). When Garrett was 16, he died suddenly from meningitis. Following the death of his first son, David relapsed into drug and alcohol abuse, after nearly 20 years of sobriety. In 2004 David began renting a home in Vancouver which he would use as a creative space for writing and production, commuting to and from his family home in California. However this arrangement proved to be tragic. On April 23, 2006 David died of heart failure caused by drug overdose in Vancouver B.C. He was 55. Today his widow, Sandy, is a successful realtor and accomplished writer in Murrieta, California.

History Inside Ittoqqortoormiit Church Ittoqqortoormiit was founded in 1925 by Ejnar Mikkelsen and some 80 Inuit settlers (70 persons from Tasiilaq and four families from western Greenland). They were brought on the ship Gustav Holm and settled south of the last known Inuit settlement in northeastern Greenland (Eskimonæs at Dødemandsbugten on the south coast of Clavering Ø, southwest of later Daneborg, 1823). The settlement was encouraged by the colonial power Denmark which at the time had a growing interest in Northeast Greenland. At the same time, the colonization was intended to improve declining living conditions in Tasiilaq, from where the settlers were more or less voluntarily transferred. The settlers soon prospered on the good hunting conditions of the new area, which was rich in seals, walruses, narwhals, polar bears and Arctic foxes. Before that, however, the area itself had been home to a dense population of Inuit in the past, as testified by ruins and other archeological remains. Ittoqqortoormiit Municipality was a former municipality of Greenland. It is now part of Sermersooq Municipality.  Transport  Ittoqqortoormiit houses Ittoqqortoormiit is one of the most remote towns in Greenland. It is served by Ittoqqortoormiit Heliport, with Air Greenland helicopters shuttling passengers between the settlement and Nerlerit Inaat Airport ( distance), with boat transfer also possible for a few months a year. In the summer, there are two Air Iceland weekly departures from Reykjavík to Nerlerit Inaat, most of the year only one flight to Iceland a week. Air Greenland has weekly flights from Kangerlussuaq and Nuuk. Economy Ittoqqortoormiit Cemetery (2018) Local hunters have made a living from whale and polar bear hunting for generations, and it remains, up to the present, a significant cultural-economical factor in the area. Flesh and by- products play a direct part in the economy of the hunting families. Income is gained by trading these products, but these options are seasonal and variable. Ittoqqortoormiit lies near large populations of shrimp and Greenland halibut, but the presence of sea ice prevents the exploitation of these resources year- round, and as a result fishing has never been extensively developed in the municipality. Tourism, on the other hand, is growing in importance. Ittoqqortoormiit is the closest town in Greenland from Iceland. The buildings at the abandoned Uunarteq settlement are used by the local inhabitants as cottages during summer. International relations =Twin towns – Sister cities= Ittoqqortoormiit is twinned with: * Aalborg, Denmark Climate Ittoqqortoormiit features a tundra climate (Köppen ET) with bitterly cold winters, chilly summers and no monthly average even close to the 10 °C threshold that would allow tree growth. In fact with a warmest monthly average of only 3 °C Ittoqqortoormiit is closer to the 0 °C threshold for an ice cap (EF) climate than a subarctic (Dfc) classification. This coupled with an average annual temperature of −8.6 °C makes Ittoqqortoormiit one of the coldest permanently inhabited locations on Earth. On the afternoon of 22 February 2005, the time of year that is normally the coldest, the temperature in the village briefly reached +15.9°C (60.6°F) Decoded synop reports due to a combination of exceptionally warm airmass and a strong foehn effect.  Population  The population of Ittoqqortoormiit has fluctuated over the past two decades, decreasing almost 17% since 2006.

It is the second and to date last piece of full-length prose fiction to have been published by the television scriptwriter Russell T Davies, who later became the chief writer and executive producer of the Doctor Who television series when it was revived in 2005. Davies's first professionally published fiction, a novelisation of his children's television serial Dark Season, had been released by BBC Books in 1991. In July 2014 it was announced that Big Finish Productions were to produce an audio drama adaptation of the novel, as part of their licensed Doctor Who range. The adaptation was released in April 2015, available as a standalone title, or in a special box set with an adaptation of Gareth Roberts's Fourth Doctor novel The Well-Mannered War. Plot The novel is set in Britain in 1987, and involves the Seventh Doctor and his companions Chris Cwej and Roz Forrester living on a working-class council estate while attempting to track down an infinitely powerful Gallifreyan weapon before it falls into the wrong hands. A young boy living on the estate, Gabriel Tyler, appears to be the focus of strange powers, and also for the attentions of Eva Jericho, whose own grievously ill young son seems to be linked to Gabriel in some way, through a secret Gabriel's mother Winnie has long tried to hide. Background Davies had already established himself as a successful writer of children's television by 1996, having penned well-received serials such as Dark Season (1991) and Century Falls (1993), and winning a BAFTA Children's Award for an episode of Children's Ward, a series he both wrote for and produced from 1992 to 1995. A staff scriptwriter at Granada Television, he was beginning to move into adult television, writing for soap operas such as Families and Revelations, the latter of which he created. Despite being a professional writer and long-time Doctor Who fan, Davies had no initial interest in writing for Virgin's Doctor Who novel series, concentrating instead on his television career. However, in 1995 he was interviewed about Dark Season and Century Falls by journalist David Richardson of TV Zone magazine, who later wrote about their meeting. \\"When we first spoke back in 1995, Davies's interest in writing for the series was evident. With Doctor Who out of production, I suggested he'd be an ideal choice to write one of the novels, and gave him a contact at Virgin Publishing.\\"Richardson, David. The Man Who. \\"TV Zone: Doctor Who Special\\". Special 56, spring 2004, page 71. However, Davies's friend and fellow writer Paul Cornell, who had written several novels for the New Adventures range, later claimed to have been the one responsible for enabling Davies to contribute to the series. \\"At the time he'd only just started to do The Grand, and we were very much on the same level. We swapped favours -- he got me onto Children's Ward, and I introduced him to [Virgin Books editor] Rebecca Levene so he could get to do Damaged Goods.\\"Cornell, Paul. Script Doctors: Paul Cornell. \\"Doctor Who Magazine\\". Issue 352, cover dated 2 February 2005, page 57. Davies himself gave his own account of the book's origins in Doctor Who Magazine's 2002 history of the New Adventures range. \\"I first thought of writing a New Adventure when David Richardson interviewed me for TV Zone... I bashed out the first two chapters in my spare time. I sent in this dead lazy submission, which just said, 'I've got no idea what happens in the end, but trust me. I write'. The arrogance of youth!\\"Quoted by Howe, David J. Tales from the Fiction Factory: Chapter Five -- From Cradle to Grave. \\"Doctor Who Magazine\\", issue 317, cover dated May 29, 2002, page 12. However, Davies found himself commissioned to write for the range by Levene, with his book forming part of the 'Psi-Powers' arc which was overarching the storyline of the novels at the time, although Davies claimed: \\"I'm not sure I completely understood the Brotherhood arc to be honest! I just kept it vague and hoped someone else would make sense of it.\\" Themes There are several aspects of Damaged Goods which contain elements present throughout much of Davies's other work. The inclusion of a family named Tyler, in particular, is a trademark of the writer -- Tylers also appear in Revelations, Queer as Folk, The Second Coming and the 2005 re-launch of Doctor Who itself.https://www.mirror.co.uk/tv/tv-news/first-doctor-who-story- written-5636280 The scene in which Mrs Jericho prepares a dinner laced with rat poison for her husband is replicated almost exactly in the concluding episode of Davies's 2003 religious telefantasy drama The Second Coming, where the leading character of Judith prepares a similarly poisoned meal for her lover Steve. There is an even more direct link to Dark Season, with the novel's epilogue featuring a mention of the main character, Marcie, from that serial. Damaged Goods contains a gay character, David, and homosexuality is a recurring theme explored in much of Davies's writing, as he himself noted in an article for The Guardian newspaper in 2003. \\"The first gay character I ever wrote was a Devil-worshipping Nazi lesbian in a Children's BBC thriller, Dark Season. She was too busy taking over the world to do anything particularly lesbian, though she did keep a Teutonic Valkyrie by her side at all times... Once I'd started, I never stopped... I even wrote a Doctor Who novel in which the six-foot blond, blue-eyed companion interrupts the hunt for an interdimensional Gallifreyan War Machine to get a blowjob in the back of a taxi. Like you do.\\"Davies, Russell T Transmission was madness. Honestly. (Subscription link). \\"The Guardian\\". Monday September 15, 2003. Davies's major breakthrough television series, Queer as Folk (1999), was centred around the lives of three gay men in Manchester, one of whom, Vince Tyler, is portrayed as a fanatical Doctor Who fan. Although never clearly seen on screen, part of the set dressing for Vince's bedroom as seen in the first episode of the series was a copy of Damaged Goods, included as an in-joke by the set dressers.Davies, Russell T Audio commentary on the 2003 \\"Definitive Collector's Edition\\" DVD boxed set of Queer as Folk. (VCD0308). Damaged Goods itself contains a reference to Why Don't You?, a BBC children's television series on which Davies was working at the time the novel is set. The Doctor Who Annual 2006, published by Panini in August 2005, contained an article entitled Meet the Doctor by Davies, which referred to \\"N-Forms\\" being one of the weapons used in the Time War referred to in the 2005 series of Doctor Who. \\"N-Forms\\" are the ancient Time Lord weapons which are featured in the plot of Damaged Goods. Reviews Reviewing the novel in his Shelf Life column in Doctor Who Magazine, the magazine's resident book critic Dave Owen was extremely positive about Damaged Goods. \\"Author Russell T Davies is a welcome new addition to Doctor Who fiction, bringing a lucid, matter-of-fact style of storytelling that has more in common with Stephen Gallagher's modern horror novels than Irvine Welsh's stylised fables... Purists might argue that a book full of sex, drugs and squalor can't really be Doctor Who, but they would be forgetting that the essence of the series and those like it is in portraying ordinary people's reactions to the unprecedented. It's done so brilliantly here that, much as I abhor scores, rankings and superlatives, I'll admit that Damaged Goods is currently my favourite New Adventure.\\"Owen, Dave. Shelf Life: Damaged Goods. \\"Doctor Who Magazine\\". Issue 243, cover dated September 25, 1996, pages 21-22. However, not all readers agreed with Owen's assessment that the setting and themes of Damaged Goods were one of its strengths. \\"Call me an escapist if you want,\\" Matthew Mitchell wrote in a review for the Outpost Gallifrey fan website, \\"but if I want a dose of the Problems of the World and Man's inhumanity to man, I'll pick up the newspaper. I don't buy science fiction, especially not Doctor Who, for a lesson in modern sociology. I certainly would not have bought Damaged Goods had I known that is precisely what I would be getting.\\" Generally, however, reaction to the novel was extremely positive, with other online reviews around the time of the book's release praising Davies's work. \\"In Damaged Goods, Russell Davies has marked himself as the best newcomer to Doctor Who fiction since Lance Parkin eight months earlier,\\" wrote Shannon Patrick Sullivan on his own website. \\"Davies has crafted a taut, compelling novel which falls down only slightly at the end. Certainly, Damaged Goods is one of the best novels Virgin has released in 1996... Damaged Goods is a template for Doctor Who in the Nineties; I hope Davies has the opportunity at a follow-up under the aegis of the BBC.\\" Sullivan's website also includes a monthly updated list of the most popular Doctor Who novels, \\"The Doctor Who Novel Rankings\\", based on votes e-mailed in by readers and running since 1993. As of the 4 January 2006 edition of the novel rankings, Damaged Goods was placed eighth in the list of most popular New Adventures novels. In 1998, Doctor Who Magazine ran their own one-off readers' poll to find the most popular New Adventures as part of their celebrations of Doctor Who's 35th anniversary. Damaged Goods received votes from 780 readers, with an average score of 7.295 out of 10, placing it thirteenth out of the sixty-one novels in the series.Owen, Dave. The best (and worst) of Virgin. \\"Doctor Who Magazine\\". Issue 265, cover dated 3 June 1998, page 35. Adaptations After having been commissioned to write the novel, Davies had originally planned to take three months off writing for television in order to complete it. He was then also commissioned to write for two major ITV television series, leaving him very short of time in which to complete the book, eventually writing the manuscript in only five weeks. This sudden amount of work did, however, have the unexpected result of Granada Television purchasing the media rights for the novel on 2 February 1997, with a view to Davies possibly scripting a television adaptation for them. \\"Granada lent me a researcher, Maria Grimley, to do all the leg-work on the novel, just so I could finish on time,\\" Davies told Doctor Who Magazine. \\"This led to various Granada folk reading Damaged Goods and suggesting that the Mrs Jericho story would make a good thriller in its own right. It would have stripped out all the sci-fi stuff -- including the Doctor, obviously! -- and been cut back to just the story of the twins separated at birth... I think the treatment was called The Mother War. Nothing happened with that because I was just too busy on The Grand.\\" In July 2014, it was announced that Big Finish Productions were to produce an audio drama adaptation of Damaged Goods, as part of their official range of Doctor Who audio dramas licensed by the BBC. The adaptation was scripted by Jonathan Morris and produced by David Richardson, whose TV Zone interview with Davies in 1995 had in part led to the original book being commissioned by Virgin in the first place. As in the original television series, the role of the Seventh Doctor was played by Sylvester McCoy. The Doctor's companions in the novel, Roz and Chris, were played by Yasmin Bannerman and Travis Oliver, with Michelle Collins as Winnie Tyler and Denise Black as Eva Jericho. The adaptation included additional references to elements from the revived television series, such as the Last Great Time War and the Torchwood Institute, both of which were devised by Davies after the original novel's release.

At the age of 15, he found work in the Montreal area, but later returned to Perth to complete his schooling.  Business career  In 1828, Cameron became a merchant in the Perth area. The year before, he had set up a general store at Port Sarnia (later Sarnia) and, in 1837, he moved there. In the same year, he served with Allan Napier MacNab during the Upper Canada Rebellion. He also set up mills in the Port Sarnia area, became involved in transporting goods and established a business cutting and selling timber.  Political career  In 1836, he was elected to the 13th Parliament of Upper Canada representing Lanark County as a moderate Reformer. Upon the formation of the Province of Canada by the union of Lower Canada and Upper Canada, he was elected to the first Parliament of the Province of Canada, again representing Lanark.J.O.

He resigned in 1843 because he could not support the government bill that moved the capital to Montreal. He continued to represent Lanark in the Legislative Assembly until 1847. In 1847, he was elected in Kent and, in 1848, was chosen to be assistant commissioner of public works, resigning in 1849. Cameron began to align himself with the Clear Grits. He pressed for the abolition of the clergy reserves and pushed for reciprocity in trade with the United States. In 1851, he was elected as an independent in Huron. He also supported Arthur Rankin in Kent against George Brown in a bitter campaign, although Brown won easily. He was given a post in the government in 1852 and, in 1853, became appointed Postmaster General. This also meant that he served on the Board of Railway Commissioners and he represented the government on the board of the Grand Trunk Railway. In 1854, Cameron ran in both South Lanark and Lambton, but was elected in neither. He was elected to the 6th Parliament of the Province of Canada as an independent representing Lambton; he defeated the Reform candidate Hope Fleming Mackenzie, the brother of Alexander Mackenzie. In 1860, he was elected to the Legislative Council for St. Clair division and Hope Mackenzie won the Lambton seat in a by-election. In 1863, he was appointed Queen's Printer with George-Paschal Desbarats, and served until 1869. In 1874, he was elected to the 3rd Canadian Parliament as a Liberal candidate in the riding of Ontario South. He died at Ottawa while in office in 1876.

History The club was formed in 1898 as Swanage Albion Football Club, joining the Dorset Junior League and winning the Dorset Junior Cup in their first season. The club then made it to the Dorset Senior League during the 1920s. The 1920s also saw the club move from their original ground at Swanage Middle School, to Days Park and change their name to Swanage Town. In the 1957–58 season the club became one of the founder members of the Dorset Combination League. The first season in the league proved very successful as the club became the leagues first winners. The next five seasons saw the club finish in the top two, by winning the league three times in a row for the 1959–60, 1960–61 and 1961–62 campaigns, and finishing Runners up for the 1958–59, and 1962–63 seasons. The 1961–62 campaign also saw the club enter the FA Cup for the first time in their history, losing to Bridport in the first qualifying round. In 1966 Swanage Town merged with local side Herston Rovers F.C., who had been playing in the Dorset Combination league for five seasons, and the club was renamed Swanage Town & Herston F.C.. The club then stayed in the Dorset Combination League for another ten seasons, until the end of the 1975–76 competition when they left the league to join the newly reformed Division One of the Western Football League. After eleven seasons in Division the club gained promotion to the Premier Division, when they finished as Champions in the Division. The 1989–90 campaign saw the club play their last season in the Western league as they then joined the Wessex Football League. The last season in the Western league saw the club clinch the Dorset Senior Cup for the first and only time, when they beat Weymouth 1–0 in the final. The first season in the Wessex Football League saw the club finish runners-up. The 1990–91 season also saw the club reach the Dorset Senior Cup final again, but this time lost to Weymouth 5–1.

Life The grave of John Adam, architect, in the Adam mausoleum, Greyfriars Kirkyard Born in Linktown of Abbotshall, now part of Kirkcaldy, Fife, he was the eldest son of architect and entrepreneur William Adam and his wife Mary Robertson (1698–1761). His younger brothers Robert and James Adam also became architects. The Adam family moved to Edinburgh in 1728, as William Adam's career as a designer of country houses began to take off. John attended Dalkeith Grammar School, outside the city, although he did not proceed to university as he was already being involved in the family businesses. However, the family home became a hub of the Scottish Enlightenment, with numerous Edinburgh virtuosi visiting. During the 1740s, William was gradually handing over control to his eldest son. Upon William's death in June 1748, John took over the family businesses, which besides designing and building houses, included interests in quarrying, mining and other industries. John also became Laird of Blair Adam, the estate in Kinross-shire which his father had built up. Finally, John inherited his father's position as Master Mason to the Board of Ordnance in North Britain. John took his younger brother Robert into partnership, and the two profited greatly from the lucrative Board of Ordnance contracts which were had been initiated following the Jacobite rising of 1745. These included the building of Fort George near Inverness, to the designs of military engineer Colonel Skinner.Paul Latcham, 'Skinner, William (1699/1700–1780)', Oxford Dictionary of National Biography, Oxford University Press, 2004; online edn, Jan 2008 accessed 2 Feb 2013 The brothers also continued to execute their late father's designs, including the pavilions and interiors of Hopetoun House. Their first major new commission came in 1754 from William Dalrymple, Earl of Dumfries. The new Dumfries House in Ayrshire was probably mostly to the design of Robert Adam, the more talented architect of the two. Robert oversaw the construction of the house until late summer 1754, when he left on his Grand Tour to Italy. Even when abroad, Robert continued to send home designs. John concentrated on the business side of the practice, although he was a competent, if formulaic, architect. John did win a competition to design a new Royal Exchange in Edinburgh, but he was not appointed as contractor. The successful contractor then appointed another architect, who made changes to the design. However, the building, which now serves as the City Chambers, is still often attributed to John Adam. On Robert's return to Britain, he established himself in London, where he was joined by the younger brothers James and William. John continued to look after the family's Scottish interests, investing in further quarrying ventures, and the Carron Iron Works. He supplied his London-based brothers with capital from the Blair Adam estate, at least until the collapse of a stock market venture by his friend Andrew Fairholme in 1764 left him out of pocket. Further losses occurred after the failure of Robert's speculative Adelphi development in 1772, and John was forced to mortgage Blair Adam. John Adam designed other houses in Edinburgh and the surrounding area, including Milton House in the Old Town, Hawkhill House, near Leith Links, for Lord Alemoor and Kerse House Robertson, A 2012 The rediscovery of 'Carss Castell': A medieval hall-house within, Kerse House, Grangemouth. Vernacular Building 36, pp. 41-60 nr. Falkirk for Sir Lawrence Dundas (all now demolished). In the Annandale town of Moffat he designed Moffat House for the Earl of Hopetoun. Among his more significant work was Adam Square, a speculative development of three houses on his own property in the city. The development, although not a true \\"square\\", represents one of the first terraces of townhouses in Edinburgh. Construction began in 1761, and despite the financial troubles, Lord President Robert Dundas was able to move in by 1768. Adam himself also lived there until 1772, as well as having a villa at Merchiston. Adam Square was demolished in the 1870s, and the site is now occupied by Adam House, a building of the University of Edinburgh. In Edinburgh he lived at Niddry's Wynd (now known as Niddry Street.Williamson's Edinburgh Street Directory 1785 Upon his death in 1792, he was succeeded as laird of Blair Adam by his only surviving son, the politician and judge William Adam. He is buried in his father's mausoleum in Greyfriars Kirkyard in Edinburgh. It is the largest monument in the graveyard and stands just south-west of the church. Family He was married to Jean Ramsay of Abbotshall in Fife (d.1795).

History  Studies and research are still in their infancy, there are only approaches and assumptions based on interpretations of the records left by some writers and settlers who came from Spain. Most of them assert that original population were indigenous belonging to the family Chimilas Carib language that inhabited the extensive river and lake region of Bolivar, Sucre, Magdalena and Cesar departments. The highest regional authority was the Chimilas Mompox and her chiefdoms: Maguey, Yati, or Simacoa Tacaloa, etc. Guazo. Indigenous had an average height of 1.65 meters, were more or less heavyset, had black hair, short legs, dark skin and short prominent nose.

He was a native of Edmonton, Alberta, but grew up in Melfort, Saskatchewan and did his first degree at the University of Saskatchewan in Philosophy and Politics. Gurstein held a PhD in Social Science from Cambridge University.  Early working life  Gurstein worked as a senior civil servant for the Province of British Columbia in 1972–1974 and for the Province of Saskatchewan (Department of Northern Saskatchewan) in 1974–1975. He then established and ran a management consulting firm, Socioscope, undertaking research linking organizations to information technology. While working as a management adviser at the United Nations in New York (1992–1995), he was offered a post as Associate Chair in the Management of Technological Change at the University College of Cape Breton. While on Cape Breton Island, he founded the Centre for Community and Enterprise Networking (C/CEN) as a community-based research laboratory (what has now come to be known as a living lab) exploring possible applications of information and communications technologies to support social change in what was then one of Canada's most economically disadvantaged regions. C/CEN, established in 1996, was a pioneer in online conference management, among other areas, and held the first online conference with simultaneous translation using IRC and court translators to provide text translation in French simultaneous to the direct meeting being transcribed in English. The Centre also undertook the first NetCorps placement (in Angola) and provided online support to the local Cape Breton music industry.  Community informatics  Gurstein's book Community Informatics: Enabling Communities with Information and Communications Technologies (Idea Group, 2000) and the conceptual framing for community informatics grew out of his experiences in Cape Breton. The book was the first major publication in the community informatics field, and introduced the term \\"community informatics\\" into wider usage as referring to the research and praxis discipline underpinning the social appropriation of information technology. Within the area of community informatics, a major contribution has been Gurstein's introduction of the notion of \\"effective use\\" as a critical analytical framework for assessing technology implementation superseding approaches based on the more commonly accepted frameworks such as that of the \\"digital divide\\". The co-edited book Connecting Canadians: Investigations in Community Informatics, was published in 2012, based on the work of the Community Research Alliance for Community Innovation and Networking (CRACIN), a major community informatics research project of which Gurstein was a co-principal investigator.  Later activities - academic and civil society  Gurstein was the Editor in Chief of the Journal of Community Informatics, was Foundation Chair of the Community Informatics Research Network and moderates the Community Informatics and Community Informatics Researchers, an Adjunct Professor in the School of Library and Information Studies in Vancouver Canada, and was formerly Research Professor at the New Jersey Institute of Technology in Newark, New Jersey, and Research Professor at the University of Quebec (Outaouais). He was also a member of the High Level Panel of Advisers of the UN's Global Alliance for ICT and Development. He also served on the Board of the Global Telecentre Alliance, Telecommunities Canada, the Pacific Community Networking Association and the Vancouver Community Net. In more recent years he had become active as a commentator, speaker and essayist/blogger articulating a community informatics (grassroots ICT user) perspective in the areas of open government data and Internet governance. Until 2016, Gurstein wrote a community informatics blog. Death Gurstein died on October 8, 2017 after a two-year battle with prostate cancer.

Myer Emporium on Lonsdale Street. Corner of Russell and Lonsdale Street looking south west Lonsdale Street is a main street and thoroughfare in the city centre of Melbourne, Australia. It runs roughly east–west and was laid out in 1837 as one of Melbourne's original boundaries within the Hoddle Grid. The street extends from Spring Street in the east to Spencer Street in the west. Lonsdale Street is home to multiple office buildings, churches, restaurants and shopping centres. Its most notable function is housing the State of Victoria's legal precinct and courthouses. The street is also named for Melbourne's first magistrate, William Lonsdale.  History  = 19th Century = Lonsdale Street was included in the grid developed by Robert Hoddle, the chief surveyor for the new settlement of Melbourne. Whilst Lonsdale and other streets were originally designed at 99 feet, then Governor Richard Bourke initially objected to the large sizing. Hoddle persuaded him, on the basis of health and convenience, to allow the larger street width featured in present-day Lonsdale Street. The foundation stone for Victoria's oldest Catholic church was laid in 1841 at the corner of Elizabeth street. The church is on the Victorian Heritage Register along with the second church on Lonsdale Street, the Uniting Wesley Church completed in 1858. In the 1860s, the Melbourne Hospital opened on Lonsdale Street, near the corner of Swanston Street. Law Courts were erected at the south-east corner of William and Lonsdale streets in 1884 to accommodate both the Supreme Court of Victoria and County Court. The court of General Sessions and the Court of Insolvency are also nearby on Lonsdale Street. During the late 19th century the home and principal business venue of brothel proprietor Caroline Hodgson, better known as 'Madame Brussels', was located at 32-34 Lonsdale Street, not far from the Parliament of Victoria in Spring Street, from which it derived much of its clientele.Bentley, Philip. (2005). 'Hodgson, Caroline (1851-1908)', in: Australian Dictionary of Biography, Supplementary Volume, Melbourne University Press, pp 182-183. = 20th Century = In 1911-1912 the Melbourne Hospital was rebuilt on Lonsdale Street and the original hospital was demolished and renamed the Queen Victoria Hospital. In 1946 it became first women's hospital in Victoria, operated for women by women. The Princess Mary Club opened on Lonsdale Street in 1926 and provided accommodation in the city for young women who would otherwise be unable to receive a tertiary education. It continued in this capacity until 1977 and is due to be demolished as of 2016, despite heritage listing for the gothic-inspired building. = 21st Century = Australian department store Myer connected their Bourke Street store, over Little Bourke Street, with another premises on Lonsdale Street. Myer occupied these premises from the 1920s until 2010, when construction began on Emporium Melbourne, which opened in its space in 2014. Melbourne Central, housing a train station and shopping centre, opened on Lonsdale Street in 1991. It is a prominent feature of Melbourne due to its famous 1889 Coop's Shot Tower conical dome. Melbourne Central connects by a pedestrian sky bridge over Lonsdale Street to the Emporium centre. From 2003, Queen Victoria Village, an integrated city block development consisting of residential units, retail outlets, and office buildings opened progressively on Lonsdale Street. The premises wrap around the only remaining pavilion of the former Queen Victoria Hospital, from where the complex derives its name.  Transport  Major bus routes run along Lonsdale Street, with services predominantly running to the Eastern suburbs. The street was formerly served by a line of Melbourne's cable tram network. Cable trams were replaced by an electric tram network in the first half of the 20th century, but Lonsdale Street trams were not converted and thus removed. Greek Precinct Between Swanston and Russell Streets there is a concentration of Greek restaurants and shops. This is known as Melbourne's Greek Precinct. The precinct is reflective of Melbourne having the largest population of Greeks outside of Greece. Melbourne is also a sister city to Thessaloniki, and a plaque commemorates this on Lonsdale Street. At the corner of Lonsdale and Russell Street is 24-hour Greek restaurant Stalactites, which is famous for being the celebration place of Cypriot tennis player Marcos Baghdatis during his 2006 Australian Open campaign. The Helenas Centre of Melbourne was also located on the corner of Lonsdale and Russell streets.

The brand name currently exists as a brand under Córdoba Music Group.

Much of the initial workforce consisted of former Epiphone workers who lost their jobs following their 1951 strike and the subsequent relocation of the company from Queens to Philadelphia.Acoustic Guitars: The Illustrated Encyclopedia by Tony Bacon and Michael Wright. Chartwell Publications, 2018 pg 62 Rapid expansion forced the company to move to much larger quarters, on Newark St. in Hoboken, New Jersey, in the old R. Neumann Leathers building. The advent of the folk music craze in the early '60s had shifted the company into production of an important line of acoustic folk and blues guitars, including a dreadnought series (D-40, D-50 and, later, D-55) that competed successfully with Martin's D-18 and D-28 models, and jumbo and Grand Concert \\"F\\" models that were particularly popular with blues guitarists like Dave Van Ronk. Notable also was the Guild 12-string guitar, which used a Jumbo \\"F\\" body and dual truss rods in the neck to produce a workhorse instrument with a deep, rich tone distinctive from the chimier twelve-strings put out by Martin. The company continued to expand, and was sold to the Avnet Corporation, which moved production to Westerly, Rhode Island, in 1966. As the folk scene quieted, a new generation of folk-rockers took Guild guitars on stage. The most notable Guild performance of that era was on the D-40 that Richie Havens played when he opened the Woodstock Festival in 1969. During the 1960s, Guild moved aggressively into the electric guitar market, successfully promoting the Starfire line of semi-acoustic (Starfire I, II & III) and semi- solid (Starfire IV, V & VI) guitars and basses. A number of early West-Coast psychedelic bands used these instruments, notably guitarists Bob Weir and Jerry Garcia and bassist Phil Lesh of the Grateful Dead, as well as Jefferson Airplane's bassist Jack Casady. Instrument maker Alembic started their transition from sound and recording work to instrument building by modifying Lesh & Casady's Starfire basses. The rare S-200 Thunderbird solid body electric was used by Muddy Waters and The Lovin' Spoonful's Zal Yanovsky. Inspired by seeing Muddy Waters, Ross Hannaford acquired a Thunderbird, which he used extensively in the period that he played in popular Australian 1970s band Daddy Cool. Guild also successfully manufactured the first dreadnought acoustic guitar with a \\"cut-away\\" in its lower shoulder to allow better access to the lower frets, the D40-C. In 1972, under Guild's new president Leon Tell, noteworthy guitarist/designer Richard \\"Rick\\" Excellente came up with the design. It is still made, copied by virtually every guitar manufacturer. The decline of the folk and acoustic market in the later '70s and early '80s put severe economic pressure on the company. While instrument specialists generally concede that quality suffered at other American competitors, Guild models from the '70s and '80s are considered still made to the high-quality standards the Westerly plant was known for. In the 1980s, Guild introduced a series of Superstrat solid bodies including models such as the Flyer, Aviator, Liberator and Detonator, the Tele-style T-200 and T-250 (endorsed by Roy Buchanan) and the Pilot Bass, available in fretted, fretless, and 4- and 5-string versions. These guitars were the first Guild instruments to bear slim pointed headstocks, sometimes called \\"pointy droopy\\", \\"duck foot\\" and \\"cake knife\\" for their distinctive shape. Fender era Swedish singer Sofia Talvik playing with a Guild in 2010. 2013 Guild hollowbodies. After several changes in management and ownership, Guild was eventually purchased by the Fender Musical Instruments Corporation in 1995. In late 2001, Fender decided to shut down the Westerly, RI factory (citing difficulty in climate control and factory production workflow as primary motives) and moved all Guild production to its factory in Corona, California. To ease the Corona facility (which had only made electric guitars up to this point) into making archtop and acoustic guitars, the Westerly factory artisans and workers prepared guitar 'kits' that they shipped to Corona. These kits were near-complete production guitars that only needed finishing and final assembly before being sent to retailers. Production in Corona was short-lived, however, as Fender acquired the assets of Washington-based Tacoma Guitar Company in 2004, and moved all American Guild acoustic guitar production to Tacoma, Washington and discontinued production of US-made Guild electric guitars completely. In 2008, Fender again moved Guild when it acquired Kaman Music Corporation and its small production facility in New Hartford, Connecticut, where hand production of all US-made Guilds resumed in a manner consistent with other high-end, boutique guitar builders. The New Hartford Guild facility began production in early 2009, starting with the top-end D-55 and F-50 models. Production quickly ramped up to include most of the popular Traditional Series acoustic guitar models. Acoustic-Electric versions of these models were also made available. Starting with 2012 models, all US-built Guild Traditional Series guitars were available in right- and left-handed configurations. In 2011, Traditional Series models' were improved by means of a new DTAR pickup system (DTAR-MS, for 'multi- source'), which allows blending between an internal microphone element and an under-saddle transducer. Previous DTAR configurations only included an under- saddle transducer. Also, hard shell case material was upgraded to a high-end, faux alligator skin material with crushed velvet interior padding, closely resembling the Custom Shop guitar cases that Guild had used when its Custom Shop was open. In late 2010, Guild released its Standard Series acoustic guitars, which were US-built guitars (still manufactured in the New Hartford, Connecticut facility) that were based on models from their top-end Traditional Series. Differences in ornamentation and instrument finish options made them more affordable. Standard Series models included the F-30, F-30R, F-50, D-40, D-50, and the return of the F-212XL 12-string model. All Standard Series models featured red spruce bracing, satin mahogany necks, and bone saddles, nuts, and bridge pins, but have lower-grade wood and different ornamentation than their Traditional Series counterparts. In 2011, cutaway acoustic-electric versions of all Standard Series models were released. These guitars featured venetian cutaways and a DTAR 18V under-saddle pickup system. These models can be identified by the 'CE' suffix at the end of the guitar's model number. All Guild guitars come with hard shell cases. The New Hartford facility had also created a new line of specialty, limited edition guitars, referred to as the GSR Series. The GSR designation stands for \\"Guild Special Run.\\" This series was first revealed to Guild dealers at Guild's dealer-only factory tour in mid-2009 called the \\"Guild Summit Retreat\\". These models featured unique takes on classic Guild Traditional Series models. GSR models include the F-20 (figured Cocbolo), F-30R (master-grade Rosewood), F-40 (figured Cocobolo), F-50 (figured Koa), and D-50 (figured Cocobolo), and Guild's only electric guitar to be produced since 2003, the GSR Starfire VI (only 20 produced). Each of these instruments features unique designs, wood selection, ornamentation, and has extremely limited production numbers. Cordoba era In the late spring/early summer of 2014, Fender's New Hartford Guild facility closed its doors as FMIC prepared to sell off the Guild brand. Cordoba Music Group (CMG), Based in Santa Monica, California, stepped in and purchased the Guild brand rights and began setting up a new manufacturing facility in Oxnard, California, led by Gibson alum Ren Ferguson as the VP of Manufacturing and R&D.; Cordoba started production in late 2015, releasing its first models (M-20 and D-20) in early 2016. Higher-end models like the D-55 were released in late 2017. Guild Import brands In the early seventies, Guild began to form import brands for acoustic and electric guitars made in Asia. There was a total of 3 import brands: Madeira, Burnside, and DeArmond. Madeira Acoustic and Electric Guitars were import guitars based on existing Guild designs. They are characterized by their substantially unique pickguard shape and differing headstock. Similarly to Madeira, Burnside Electric Guitars were Guild electric guitar designs (typically of super-Strat delineation) manufactured outside the United States. The headstocks on these guitars read \\"Burnside by Guild.\\" Both brands were discontinued in the early '90s. After Fender purchased Guild in the mid '90s, reissues of some Guild electric guitars were manufactured in Korea under the DeArmond brand name, which Fender also owned the rights to. Import reissue models included the Starfire, X155, T400, M-75 Bluesbird, S-73, and Pilot Bass series. On the front of the headstock, these instruments display the DeArmond logo above a modified version of Guild's Chesterfield logo. On early production versions, the truss rod cover is stenciled with the word 'Guild' stylized and the DeArmond reissue model number, and the back of the headstock is stenciled with 'DeArmond by Guild' above the guitar's serial number. Later production versions drop all references to the Guild brand name except for a modified Chesterfield headstock inlay on most models. The DeArmond line also included other less expensive models similar in design to the Guild reissues and manufactured in Indonesia. The DeArmond brand was discontinued in the early 2000s. While not a discrete brand, in the early 2000s, FMIC created a new line of Guild acoustic guitars called the GAD- series, which stood for \\"Guild Acoustic Design.\\" As with the other import lines, these guitars were based on past and present Guild acoustic guitar designs, but were built in China. All of these models were designated with a 'GAD' as a model prefix. These guitars featured poly finishes (as opposed to traditional nitrocellulose lacquer on US models) and nondescript wood grading. FMIC did not choose to create this line under a different brand name, but left it as a new series of guitars from Guild. This choice caused confusion for buyers, as it marked the first time that an import had actually donned the Guild brand name, which had previously only been used to describe US-made guitars. Because of this, it was no longer immediately clear if a Guild- branded guitar is a US-made model or an import, although the GAD models usually had unique ornamentation. The 2011 GAD models brought new features, looks, and model numbers. These new GAD-series Guild guitars could be identified with a number 1 as the first number in the model number. For example, a US-built F-50R's GAD-level version would be called an F-150R. Similarly, a US-built F-512 would be an F-1512 as a GAD version. With Cordoba taking over as owners of the Guild brand, as of May, 2015, the GAD line-up was discontinued, but 2 newly formed lines, Westerly Collection (acoustics) and Newark Street (electrics) were revealed, which also aimed to pay homage Guild's production history that took place at those locations (with the Newark Street address alluding to a link with the Hoboken factory). The Westerly Collection line-up includes a variety of guitars made with solid wood tops/laminate sides & body; and, solid wood tops/solid wood sides & solid wood backs.

It is now no longer awarded. The Conjoint Board was superseded in 1994 by the United Examining Board, which lost its permission to hold qualifying medical examinations after 1999. Medical education at the London Teaching Hospitals began centuries before there was a university in London to award medical degrees. Those who had taken BAs at Oxford or Cambridge, or occasionally started their pre-clinical education at universities further afield, could return there to take medical examinations, but it was open to most to take the examinations of the London medical corporations. As the early 19th century law restricting medical employment in the British military to those who had qualifications in both medicine and surgery was taken to require diplomas from different organisations, it became customary to take both the Licence of the Society of Apothecaries (LSA) and the Membership of the Royal College of Surgeons of England (MRCS). These corporations diverged: the Society of Apothecaries added surgery to their examination, to grant a Licence in Medicine and Surgery (LMSSA) as a complete qualification. The surgeons then teamed up with the Royal College of Physicians of London who paired their Licentiate diploma (LRCP) with the MRCS to create the English Conjoint Diploma in 1884. The London LRCP had previously been a means for Bachelors or licentiates in medicine from Oxford and Cambridge (and a few MDs from elsewhere) to qualify to practise in London as physicians (i.e. internal medicine specialists, as distinct from surgeons or apothecaries). The old LRCP also allowed the holder by custom to be addressed as \\"doctor\\" without holding a university doctorate: this privilege became generalised in the 19th century to all licentiates and Bachelors of Medicine. The nomenclature of the diplomas may have contributed to the nearly-obsolete practice of general practitioners styling themselves as \\"Physician and Surgeon\\": previously they were mostly regarded as Apothecaries. There were also Scottish and Irish conjoint qualifications: the former became known as the Triple Qualification. In the 19th century, the new University of London Bachelor of Medicine and Bachelor of Surgery degrees were regarded as more academic than the Royal Colleges' diplomas, so many people qualified and started practice with the Conjoint before taking the M.B. and B.S. a year or two later. This paralleled the practice in some European countries of taking a state medical examination separately from or instead of a university degree. In the English provincial cities, some medical schools developed separately from the new Redbrick universities, so the Conjoint diplomas were at first usually taken. Armed forces officer cadets would be promoted from second lieutenant to lieutenant on qualifying, which included the conjoint qualification. The difference in pay between the times of the two exams would more than pay for the entry fee, and seniority in the officer corps was enhanced by those few months. The conjoint diploma of the London Royal Colleges (Royal College of Surgeons of England and Royal College of Physicians of London) was more reputable in its day, but after World War II, it was regarded as a practice exam before university finals. It provided a safety net in that medical students unsure whether they would pass or fail would have two chances if they took both. By far the greatest use of the Conjoint and similar qualifications in recent years was as a means for foreign medical graduates to obtain British qualifications, which eased their problems of obtaining registration and employment in the U.K., and also made it easier to go on to work in third countries. The scheme of examinations included a notional full set of pre-clinical subjects (anatomy, physiology, pharmacology, pathology, etc.) from which those who had university passes or another final medical qualification would be exempted: but fees might still have to be paid. The closure of this portal, along with the recent recategorisation of junior doctors from student to worker status for immigration purposes, may hasten the changeover of the National Health Service's dependence from Third World medical graduates to European Union doctors, who may not be asked to submit to further examination. These subtleties of the British system of medical qualifications were rarely known to patients, who may have been more impressed to see \\"MB BS MRCS LRCP\\" on a brass plate than \\"MD FRCP\\".

It went on to acquire more explicitly racial connotations, being dominated in the 1960s and 1970s by self-proclaimed white nationalist organisations that opposed non-white and Asian immigration, such as the National Front (NF), the British Movement (BM) and British National Party (BNP), or the British Union of Fascists (BUF). Since the 1980s, the term has mainly been used to describe those groups, such as the English Defence League, who express the wish to preserve what they perceive to be British culture, and those who campaign against the presence of non-indigenous ethnic minorities and what they perceive to be an excessive number of asylum seekers. The NF and the BNP have been strongly opposed to non-white immigration. They have encouraged the repatriation of ethnic minorities: the NF favours compulsory repatriation, while the BNP favours voluntary repatriation. The BNP have had a number of local councillors in some inner-city areas of East London, and towns in Yorkshire and Lancashire, such as Burnley and Keighley. East London has been the bedrock of far-right support in the UK since the 1930s, whereas BNP success in the north of England is a newer phenomenon. The only other part of the country to provide any significant level of support for such views is the West Midlands. History A flowchart showing the history of the early British fascist movement =1930s to 1960s= The British far right rose out of the fascist movement. In 1932, Oswald Mosley founded the British Union of Fascists (BUF), which was banned during World War II. Founded in 1954 by A. K. Chesterton, the League of Empire Loyalists became the main British far right group at the time. It was a pressure group rather than a political party, and did not contest elections. Most of its members were part of the Conservative Party, and they were known for politically embarrassing stunts at party conferences. It has been argued that the majority of this group were more 'Colonel Blimpish' traditionalists, rather than fascists. However, its more extreme elements wanted to make the group more political. This led to a number of splinter groups forming, including the White Defence League and the National Labour Party. These both stood in local elections in 1958, and merged in 1960 to form the British National Party (BNP). With the decline of the British Empire becoming inevitable, British far-right parties turned their attention to internal matters. The 1950s had seen an increase in immigration to the UK from its former colonies, particularly India, Pakistan, the Caribbean and Uganda. Led by John Bean and Andrew Fountaine, the BNP opposed the admittance of these people to the UK. A number of its rallies, such as one in 1962 in Trafalgar Square, London, ended in race riots. After a few early successes, the party got into difficulties and was destroyed by internal arguments. In 1967 it joined forces with John Tyndall and the remnants of Chesterton's League of Empire Loyalists to form the National Front (NF). The Conservative Monday Club, a far-right group within the Conservative Party, was formed in 1961. Its stated aim was \\"to safeguard the liberty of the subject and integrity of the family in accordance with the customs, traditions, and character of the British people\\". They expressed general opposition to post- colonial states and immigration, as well as support for hard-line loyalism in Northern Ireland. =1970s to 1990s= The NF quickly grew to be the biggest British far right party in the UK. It polled 44% in a local election in Deptford, London, and finished third in three by-elections, although these results were atypical of the country as a whole. The party supported extreme loyalism in Northern Ireland, and attracted Conservative Party members who had become disillusioned after Harold Macmillan had recognised the right to independence of the African colonies, and had criticised Apartheid in South Africa. During the 1970s, the NF's rallies became a regular feature of British politics. Election results remained strong in a few working class urban areas, with a number of local council seats won, but the party never came anywhere near winning representation in parliament. The smaller far right groups maintained anti-immigration policies, but there was a move towards a more inclusionist vision of the UK, and a focus on opposing what became the European Union. The NF began to support non-white radicals such as Louis Farrakhan. This led to the splintering of the various groups, with radical political soldiers such as a young Nick Griffin forming the Third Way group, and traditionalists creating the Flag Group. Membership of the Monday Club meanwhile, who gave strong support to Apartheid in South Africa and to Ian Smith's illegal declaration of independence in Rhodesia, fell to under 600 by 1987. Nick Griffin led the BNP from 1999 to 2014. John Tyndall formed the New National Front in 1980, and changed its name to the British National Party (BNP) in 1982. They, alongside the Conservative Monday Club, campaigned against the increasing integration of the UK into the European Union. However, Tyndall's reputation of a 'brutal, street fighting background' and his admiration for Hitler and the Nazis prevented the party from gaining any respectability. They developed a policy of eschewing the traditional far right methods of extra-parliamentary movements, and concentrated instead on the ballot box. Nick Griffin replaced Tyndall as BNP leader in 1999 and introduced several policies to make the party more electable. Repatriation of ethnic minorities was made voluntary and several other policies were moderated. =2000s= The National Front continued to decline, whilst Nick Griffin and the BNP grew in popularity. Around the turn of the 21st century, the BNP won a number of councillor seats. They continued their anti-immigration policy, and a damaging BBC documentary led to Griffin being charged with incitement to racial hatred (although he was acquitted). The 2006 local elections brought the BNP the most successful results of any far right party in British history. They gained 33 council seats, the second highest gain of any party at the elections; in Barking and Dagenham, they gained 12 councillor seats. In the 2008 local elections, the party won a record 100 councillor seats, and a seat on the Greater London Assembly, the biggest gains the party has had so far. At the June 2009 European Parliament Election, the BNP gained two Members of the European Parliament for Yorkshire and the Humber and North West England. In October 2009, BNP leader Nick Griffin was allowed on the BBC topical debate show Question Time. His appearance caused much controversy and the show was watched by over 8 million people. Current (2010–) At the 2010 general election, the BNP fielded 338 candidates across England, Scotland and Wales and won 563,743 votes (1.9% of total) but no seats. Nick Griffin subsequently said he would resign as BNP leader in 2013, and was eventually expelled from the party in 2014 as the BNP fell into obscurity. The National Front fielded 17 candidates at the 2010 Election and received 10,784 votes. The anti- Islamist group, the English Defence League (EDL) started to rise in popularity, appealing to nationalist sentiments on a cultural rather than explicitly racial basis. Originally formed in Luton in 2009, it protests against what it considers the Islamification of Britain by organising demonstrations in towns and cities across England, the largest of which occurred in Luton in February 2011. Soon after, right-wing populist party UK Independence Party (UKIP) started to gain popularity. Although labelled as far-right by some political observers, the UKIP was not universally considered so. The UKIP and the EDL have benefited from a rightward shift in the electorate, while former far-right parties such as the BNP and National Front have become fringe groups and wield very little media attention or power. In 2010 Robin Tilbrook, the chairman of the English nationalist party the English Democrats, met with Sergey Yerzunov, a member of the executive committee of the Russian nationalist group Russky Obraz. Shortly afterwards, Obraz announced that they were in alliance with the English Democrats. Other members of this alliance include Serbian Obraz, 1389 Movement, Golden Dawn, Danes' Party, Slovenska Pospolitost, Workers' Party and Noua Dreaptă. Since 2010, a number of former members of the BNP have joined the English Democrats, with the party chairman quoted as saying, \\"They will help us become an electorally credible party.\\" In an April 2013 interview, Tilbrook said that about 200-300 out of the party's membership of 3,000 were former BNP members. He said it was \\"perfectly fair\\" that such people would \\"change their minds\\" and join a \\"moderate, sensible English nationalist party\\". In 2011, the far-right, anti- Islamist party Britain First was formed by former members of the BNP. Britain First campaigns primarily against immigration, multiculturalism and what it sees as the Islamisation of the United Kingdom, and advocates the preservation of traditional British culture. The group is inspired by Ulster loyalism and has a vigilante wing called the \\"Britain First Defence Force\\". It attracted attention by taking direct action such as protests outside homes of alleged Islamists, and what it describes as \\"Christian patrols\\" and \\"invasions\\" of British mosques, and has been noted for its online activism. Its leader Paul Golding stood as a candidate in the 2016 London mayoral election, receiving 31,372 or 1.2% of the vote, coming eighth of twelve candidates. Golding was jailed for eight weeks in December 2016 for breaking a court order banning him from entering mosques or encouraging others to do so. In June 2016, Jo Cox was murdered by a far-right extremist after being stoked by the campaigns surrounding the Brexit referendum. Scholars have suggested that far-right attitudes contributed to and were normalised by the result of the Brexit referendum. In December 2016, the neo-Nazi group National Action was proscribed as a terrorist organisation. In March 2018 Mark Rowley, the outgoing head of UK counter-terror policing, revealed that four far-right terror plots had been foiled since the Westminster attack in March 2017. In November 2018 three people, Adam Thomas, Claudia Patatas and Daniel Bogunovic, were convicted of being members of the proscribed terrorist organisation, National Action, after a seven-week trial at the Crown Court in Birmingham. Thomas and Patatas have a child which they named Adolf. Since 2018, under the leadership of Gerard Batten, UKIP has been widely described as moving into far-right territory, at which point many longstanding members – including former leaders Nigel Farage and Paul Nuttall – left. As the new permanent leader, Batten focused the party more on opposing Islam and sought closer relations with the far-right activist Tommy Robinson and his followers.

Born onscreen on January 8, 1996, the role was initially portrayed by infant children. In 1998, Starr was rapidly aged when young actress Kristen Alderson debuted in the childhood role, which retconned the character's birth year to 1992. Following the cancellation of One Life to Live and its conclusion in 2012, Alderson carried the role over to ABC's last remaining soap opera, General Hospital, winning a Daytime Emmy Award for Outstanding Younger Actress in a Drama Series for the portrayal in 2013. Alderson is the second One Life to Live actor after Gerald Anthony (Marco Dane) to win an Emmy for a crossover role to General Hospital. Starr is the oldest child of Todd Manning and Blair Cramer. Starr and younger brother, Jack and distant cousin, Zane Buchanan, are the only three characters biologically related to both longtime One Life to Live rivals Victoria Lord and Dr. Dorian Cramer Lord. The character's most significant storylines featured her dealing with her parents' volatile relationship, her early adolescent friendship with Matthew Buchanan, portrayed by Alderson's real-life brother, Eddie, and her close friendship with Langston Wilde, as well as her romantic relationships with Cole Thornhart and James Ford on One Life to Live and Michael Corinthos on General Hospital. Casting and creation The role of Starr was originated by child actors, Ariella and Natalie Jamnik who appeared in the role from in January 1996 upon the character's birth onscreen. The Jamnik sisters departed from the series in January 1998 and Meghan Rayder briefly appeared in the role throughout February 1998. Kristen Alderson first made her debut in the role of Starr Manning on March 20, 1998 on One Life to Live. After a 3-year stint, in April 2001, Alderson signed a 5-year contract making her at the time the youngest performer in daytime television to appear in a contract role. In the spring of 2009, rumors began to circulate that Alderson was about to leave the series due to her not getting along with co-star, Brandon Buddy who played Cole Thornhart. However, Alderson later revealed in an interview that both rumors were completely false. Upon the serial's cancellation, it was announced that production company Prospect Park would continue production of the series, along with ABC's other cancelled soap opera All My Children as web series. In October 2011, it was reported that Alderson was in negotiations to continue with the soap opera online. However, Soaps In Depth later confirmed that Alderson and her brother, Eddie, had declined the offer to continue with the series, and would be relocating to California. Two days before the airing of One Life to Live's series finale on ABC, the network announced that Alderson, and several other co-stars including her onscreen parents Kassie DePaiva and Roger Howarth would be reprising their roles on the last remaining ABC soap opera, General Hospital. Alderson began taping her first scenes on January 27 and several days later revealed through Twitter that she had signed a three- year deal. It was then announced that Van Hughes would briefly reprise his role as Cole. Alderson would make her first appearance during the week of February 20, with she and Hughes first appearing on February 24. In January 2013, news broke that Alderson and other One Life to Live co-stars who had been airing on General Hospital were to depart or \\"at least temporarily exit\\". One Life to Live was in the process of being brought back by Prospect Park's The Online Network, and according to Zap2it, \\"Prospect Park realizes these three characters could initially help draw fans to the new One Life [...] There are ongoing talks between ABC and Prospect Park about the characters returning to General Hospital at some point, which could be fine with [Prospect Park] as they eventually want to go much younger with their soaps.\\" However, it was confirmed that Starr would not appear on either soap opera until a contractual agreement is signed. At the time, Prospect Park owned the rights to all One Life to Live characters; TV Guide reported that because ABC does not want to risk any further legal disputes with Prospect Park concerning the characters, the only way to avoid such disputes may be to have the former One Life to Live actors portray \\"characters that in no way resemble the current ones\\" in order to stay on General Hospital. As a result, Alderson made her final appearance as Starr on General Hospital on March 20, 2013. She later returned to the series in May as Kiki Jerome. Development =Characterization= As a child, Starr is known for her mischievous behavior, exacerbated by her parents' chaotic relationship. Still as strong- willed as ever, Starr nonetheless settles down during her teen years. Alderson described Starr as being very stubborn when she does not get things her way or when someone goes against what she honestly believes is right; very much like her parents. \\"When Starr was younger, she was a brat and if she wanted something, she would fight until she got it,\\" Alderson said. Though Starr mellows out during her teen years, a 2010 storyline in which another girl threatens her relationship with Cole forces the character to revert to her old ways. Alderson said, \\"Lately, we haven't seen that side of her because it hasn't had to come out. The fans were missing that spunk and backbone, so they'll be excited to see Starr back in her element. She's going to fight for what she believes in.\\" In a 2009 interview, Michael Fairman highlighted that Starr changed a lot after becoming a teenage mother. Alderson said that the storyline helped her mature personally, and also allowed the maturation of the character. Starr shares similarities with both her parents. Very much like her mother, when Starr is very distraught, she leans on the nearest man. This is displayed on two separate occasions when Starr falls for other guys due to her relationship with Cole being in shambles. =Musical element= In 2007, the series produced \\"Prom Night: The Musical\\", a number of musical episodes focusing on the Llanview high school prom. Cole and Starr are the center of attention as it features songs performed by Alderson, Buddy and several other cast members. The episodes began airing on June 15 and concluded on June 20, 2007. The cast members also appeared ABC's The View for a performance of the song, \\"We Belong\\" written by Pat Benatar. In 2008, after forgetting Starr's 16th birthday, her family throws her a surprise birthday bash featuring R&B; superstar, Mary J. Blige. In 2010, the series produced a sequel to the original musical, named \\"Starr X'd Lovers\\" to coincide with May Sweeps. Within the series, the title is actually a musical written by Starr's best friend, Langston (Brittany Underwood), based on Cole and Starr's love story. According to head-writer Ron Carlivati, the night is very significant for Starr as it is her senior prom. Though the original musical focused mainly on Starr and Cole, the 2010 revival featured more characters allowing Alderson to share her performance of Benatar's \\"We Belong\\" with co-stars, Underwood, Kelley Missal (Danielle Manning) and Meghann Fahy (Hannah O'Connor). Alderson performed on eight of the nine songs featured in the episodes. Some critics accused the series of trying to \\"rip off\\" the very successful Disney franchise, High School Musical and the Fox musical series, Glee. Alderson defended One Life stating that the show had always had a rich musical history, and that what set them apart from the things they were being compared to was the unique characters and storylines. In summer, 2011, One Life to Live returned to musical themes for the character of Starr by having her develop a friendship with college DJ Baz Moreau (Barret Helms). The two began writing and recording music together, much to the dismay of her then-boyfriend, James (Nic Robuck). The relationship is complicated even further when Baz suddenly kisses Starr and she rejects him. When Baz wants to sign a record contract with former adult film producer turned music mogul, Rick Powers (Austin Peck); Starr is hesitant due to his part in blackmailing James's ex-girlfriend, Deanna Forbes (Nafessa Williams) into doing a porn scene with her sister Danielle's boyfriend, Nate Salinger (Lenny Platt). Alderson as Starr later shot a music video for the song featuring James. Rick, fearing Starr's original video was not racy enough capitalizes on Starr's recent arrest for helping Todd (Howarth) escape jail, and convinces her to record the song \\"Jail Bait\\" and another video featuring Nate fueling rumors that they are sleeping together. =Cole Thornhart= Alderson with costar Brandon Buddy as Cole and Starr in 2010. In the fall of 2006, Brandon Buddy made his first appearance as Cole Thornhart creating a Romeo and Juliet-esque story as Todd raped Cole's mother, Marty Saybrooke (Susan Haskell) in college. Early on in their relationship, the couple faces off with the mean girl, Britney Jennings (originally Katrina Bowden, then Portia Reiners) who sets out to ruin Starr after Cole rejects her in favor of Starr; Britney's torture starts with teasing Starr about her parents. Britney goes so far as to dose Cole with steroids which leads to him attacking Starr at a party. With everything in the world against them, Starr and Cole realize their love for one another on prom night in 2007. Starr does her best to comfort a grieving Cole when Marty (Christina Chambers) is \\"killed\\" in an explosion. This causes tension between Starr and Langston who believes she can understand Cole more because she has dealt with losing her parents. Starr does not like that Langston thinks she knows Cole better than she [Starr] does and becomes a bit overprotective. According to Alderson's costar, Brittany Underwood (Langston), \\"Starr hates not being able to relate or understand the way Langston can understand Cole.\\" Starr also feels left out when Langston and Cole must attend grief counseling sessions together. \\"Your best friend and your boyfriend, the two people you hang out with most in your life, all of a sudden start hanging out together and you're not allowed to be with them or talk to them about it.\\" Teen pregnancy In 2008, One Life to Live launched a storyline featuring Starr focusing on teen pregnancy as part of The National Campaign to Prevent Teen and Unplanned Pregnancy. Despite disapproval from some fans — as well as Starr's father, Todd — Starr and Cole have sex for the first time in March 2008. To coincide with the storyline, Alderson started a blog on the official ABC Daytime website in which she discussed her take on the storyline, and the issues of teen sex and pregnancy, and Starr's choices, as well the consequences of those choices. Alderson's blog launched on March 7, 2008. ABC previously partnered with the campaign for the teen pregnancy storyline featuring Starr's cousin, Jessica Buchanan (Erin Torpey) in 1998 and Lulu Spencer (Julie Marie Berman) in 2006. Alderson discussed the storyline in an issue of Seventeen: In an interview with Soap Central's Dan J. Kroll, Alderson described the plot as being \\"a very adult storyline… It's a very big issue and we feel very honored to be doing such a powerful storyline and hopefully educate some viewers about teenage pregnancy because it's a very big issue and it [can be] scary.\\" In January 2009, Soap Opera Digest conducted an interview with Amy Kramer, the director of Entertainment Media for the campaign. Kramer discussed the campaign's history with ABC and also gave some facts about the storyline: Baby switch and Schuyler Joplin Starr's decision to put the child up for adoption and the child's supposed \\"death\\" eventually drives the couple apart. By 2009, Cole is struggling with a drug addiction and Starr's attempts to help him deal start to bring them closer together. For May Sweeps, Starr's storyline involves the investigation into her late daughter, Hope's mysterious death. Starr finally learns the truth [that her child was switched at birth by her cousin Jessica (Bree Williamson)'s alternate personality, Bess, when Jessica's baby is stillborn] and she is finally reunited with daughter. However, Starr is now faced with a tough decision, \\"Do I keep her? Or, do I still give her to Marcie (Kathy Brier)?\\" Brier and her costar Chris Stack who portrayed Marcie's husband, Michael were about to leave the show, leaving fans to wonder if they would be taking Hope with them. The reveal also coincides with Llanview High school's annual prom and Alderson revealed that Starr and Cole finally get the chance to be teenagers again. However, \\"they can’t take their minds off of it, because their daughter is being exhumed that night.\\" Starr is also kidnapped by one of Todd's enemies, Zach Rosen forcing Blair to exchange her freedom for Starr's.During Starr's time away from Cole, she develops a crush on her biology teacher, Schuyler Joplin (Scott Clifton), the son of the woman who delivered baby Hope, the late Dr. Leah Joplin (Maureen Mueller). Alderson revealed that when her character suddenly begins falling for Schuyler, she is on the rebound because she is missing Cole. \\"[Cole] was her best friend, and she wanted to be with him so bad. Langston is her best friend, but at the same time, Cole was going through terrible times like Starr was.\\" Starr knows she and Cole can't bet together because they both are dealing with their own individual issues, so she goes and finds someone else, Schuyler, and projects her feelings for Cole onto him. Alderson stated that Starr's attraction to her teacher developed \\"out of desperation.\\" Schuyler helps her realize that the feelings they had for one another were not real, as they were both on the rebound from failed relationships. Hannah and James In the spring of 2010, Starr does not have a date to prom because Cole is in prison. At the time, Cole and Starr's relationship is being threatened by Cole's college lab partner, the crazed Hannah O'Connor (Meghann Fahy). Alderson describes Starr's life as being blown apart. Starr and Cole at the time are juggling being parents finishing high school, and their lives appear to be \\"settling down,\\" — enter Hannah. \\"She spills coffee on herself with Cole, and then Todd, my dad, walks in on the two of them. Something innocent gets blown out of proportion, and then when Marty's pushed down the stairs, Cole automatically thinks it's Todd. It's been upsetting for Starr.\\" Carlivati stated Hannah as being a \\"real problem.\\" Cole's incarceration for his brutal attack on \\"Todd\\" allows for the introduction of another love interest, James (Nic Robuck), the younger brother of Robert Ford (David A. Gregory), the man Langston is cheating on Markko with. When James and Starr are forced to go on the run together, they fall for one another very quickly. When asked if Starr would get revenge on Hannah for interfering with her relationship with Cole, Alderson revealed that Starr is more focused on whether Cole will be able to make it to the prom. Starr's trust in her father, \\"Todd\\" (Trevor St. John) that Hannah is responsible for Cole's mother, Marty miscarriage, while Cole blames \\"Todd\\" thanks to Hannah's accusations. When asked if the couple would make it past the next obstacle, Alderson explained, though they love one another and they still have a connection, Cole's friendship with Hannah is what tears them apart. Cole taking Hannah's side when Marty miscarries only makes matters worse. Starr knows Hannah intends to win Cole for herself forcing Starr to fight for Cole. According to Alderson, Cole and Starr are forced to grow up very fast, while their parents continue acting like children, in order to deal with all the issues they face, including the tension between their parents, and becoming teenage parents. Despite them being forced into adulthood, Starr sees their senior prom as sort of a full-circle event, because prom is where it all began for them. In late 2010, it is announced that Brandon Buddy would be departing from the series with his character, Cole being sent back to prison for violating his probation. Alderson compares her attraction to James to her prior attraction to Schuyler; because Cole is going to be in jail for the next several years, Starr leans on James. Alderson revealed that James being around Starr's age would be a real threat to her relationship with Cole \\"because unlike Schuyler, this is what James wants. Schuyler did not want to get with Starr at any point. He felt feelings for her like a friend. He cared about her, but James not only cares about Starr; he really does have feelings for her and wants to be with her.\\" Starr ends her relationship with Cole in early 2011 and soon begins dating James. The relationship is quickly threatened with the introduction of James's ex-girlfriend, Deanna and Starr's music producer, Baz Moreau. Baz seems to have feelings for Starr, but she quickly rejects him because she is dating James. After causing a bit of trouble for the couple, and breaking up Starr's sister Danielle's relationship with Nate, Deena leaves town. Upon the serial's cancellation, many began speculate that Cole would return to the series in time for the finale. However, the show is forced to abandon those plans and quickly recast the role with actor Van Hughes due to Buddy being unable to continue taping. =Losing Cole and Hope= Upon Alderson's introduction as Starr on General Hospital, it was assumed by fans and critics that Starr would be paired with Michael Corinthos (Chad Duell). However, many wondered what would happen to Cole and Hope. Viewers are shocked in late February when Starr survives a fatal car accident that kills Cole and Hope. Alderson responded to the decision on Twitter urging fans not to blame head-writer Ron Carlivati revealing that both Buddy and Hughes were unavailable to continue in the role of Cole. Alderson promised her fans that the storyline would definitely lead to greater possibilities for Starr. Starr goes on the war path when Michael's father, Sonny is arrested in connection to the shooting which led to the car accident. At the time, Michael is also grieving the loss of his girlfriend, and according to Alderson he is the \\"only person that could really understand what Starr is going through.\\" Storylines =1996–2005= Upon birth, baby Starr is kidnapped by her presumed dead father to make her mother after finding her with another man.

Reception Alderson received fan mail from fans all over in response to her portrayal of pregnant teenaged Starr, \\"[…] the most important thing is that we've gotten teenagers and their parents to really talk about the issue and ask the important questions. 'Do you have a plan? What are you going to do? Is this the right time for you?' And they have gotten so much closer to their parents and it warms out hearts to hear that,\\" Alderson revealed in an interview. Amy Kramer also commented on the success of Alderson's online blog about the storyline; \\"Kristen had hundreds of comments on the blog during the pregnancy — people sharing their own stories about their own relationships with their boyfriends or their parents, or [writing] how they felt about it.\\" Kramer also applauded the series for the strong portrayal of Starr's mother during her pregnancy.

Alderson also applauded the storyline saying \\"[…] it is written so that it never ends. It’s written in a way that has explored everything, and has not been cut short, and nothing has been left out, or any important moments or decisions that characters have to make. It’s an actors dream to be on a show where you can develop the character in its entirety.\\" In November 2010, Alderson and costar Brandon Buddy were honored by Michael Fairman giving them the \\"Power Performance of the Week\\" when Starr and Cole were forced to say goodbye after he is sentenced to 10 years in prison.

He was a member of the Republican Party. Regan's political career began on the Buffalo Common Council. He rose to prominence as the third Erie County Executive during the 1970s. Regan then became New York State Comptroller, and served in that role for nearly 15 years. He appeared on the Republican ticket in five statewide elections, more than any politician in the history of New York. From 2000 to 2004, Regan was president of Baruch College of the City University of New York, where he also served as a professor. Life Born in Plainfield, New Jersey to William and Caroline (née Van Buren) Regan, Edward Van Buren Regan was raised in Utica, New York. He attended Nichols School, a prep school in Buffalo, New York, graduating in 1947.McFadden, Robert D. \\"Edward V.

He attended primary school in Utica, N.Y., and graduated from the Nichols School in Buffalo in 1947 and from Hobart College in Geneva, N.Y., in 1952.\\" He graduated in the Hobart Class of 1952 at Hobart and William Smith Colleges, where he was a member of The Kappa Alpha Society, and cum laude from University at Buffalo Law School in 1964. In 1970, he was defeated by the incumbent Comptroller Arthur Levitt Sr., but was elected New York State Comptroller in 1978, and re-elected in 1982, 1986 and 1990. He remained in office until May 7, 1993 when he resigned. He was succeeded by Carl McCall who was elected by the New York State Legislature to fill the unexpired term. Prior to becoming Comptroller, Regan served as County Executive of Erie County. He also served as a councilman in Buffalo. Regan was investigated by law enforcement officials after the disclosure of a memo written by members of his staff, one of which pointedly said, \\"Those who give will get.\\" He denied any impropriety. Regan was briefly a candidate for the Republican nomination for Governor of New York in 1982, but withdrew from the race. Regan was Chairman of the Municipal Assistance Corporation for New York City in the 1990s. The corporation was set up in the 1970s to assist with the financial recovery of New York City following the city's fiscal crisis and near bankruptcy. In the early 1990s, Regan served as a member of the US Competitiveness Policy Council and ably led its efforts on Corporation Governance. After leaving the comptroller's office, Regan served as a board member of numerous business and nonprofit organizations. He was President of Baruch College in New York from 2000-04. After retiring from the Baruch presidency, Regan became a professor at the Graduate Center of the City University of New York. He served as a trustee of the Financial Accounting Foundation and was a consultant to the Chairman of the Financial Accounting Standards Board (FASB) on matters of the convergence of GAAP with international accounting standards. For several months in 2005 and 2006, he served as the first chairman of the Erie County Fiscal Stability Authority, which was set up by the state in order to oversee the county's finances and make recommendations to the county government on financial affairs. The authority, considered a \\"soft\\" control board, was created in response to the Erie County fiscal crisis of 2005. In January 2007, he served on the search committee for a new State Comptroller, following the resignation of Comptroller Alan Hevesi. The other search committee members were former State Comptroller Carl McCall and former New York City Comptroller Harrison J. Goldin. The committee recommended New York City Finance Commissioner Martha Stark, Nassau County Comptroller Howard Weizman and businessman William Mulrow to the State Legislature for consideration, but the Legislature elected Thomas DiNapoli instead. Regan was a faculty member at the City University of New York (CUNY), holding the title of \\"Distinguished Professor\\" at Baruch College and the Graduate Center, and also teaching at the Macaulay Honors College on the civic and economic issues affecting New York City. He was a consultant to the chairman of the Financial Accounting Standards Board (FASB) working on a project with the International Accounting Standards Board (IASB) to create a global set of high-quality financial reporting standards. He was active in many civic organizations such as the Council on Foreign Relations, the Committee for Economic Development and the New York Economic Club. Death On October 18, 2014, Regan died at a hospital in Greenwich, Connecticut at the age of 84. At the time of his death he had Alzheimer's disease and lived in a retirement home in Rye, New York.

History The Beverley's ice-cream parlour/record shop at 135 Orange Street in Kingston was run by the Chinese-Jamaican Kong family, one of whom, Leslie Kong, started the Beverley's record label.Larkin, Colin (1998) The Virgin Encyclopedia of Reggae, Virgin Books, , p.24 Kong launched the label in 1961 after Jimmy Cliff auditioned the song \\"Dearest Beverley\\" at the shop, the first release on the label being Cliff's \\"Hurricane Hattie\\", with \\"Dearest Beverley\\" on the b-side. Prior to this, Beverley's was a restaurant and records shop owned by Leslie Kong and his brothers, Fats and Cecil and never had produced records. Kong had no experience of record production but had the finances to employ the cream of Jamaica's musical talent. The association with Cliff continued, including the \\"Miss Jamaica\\" single, and Cliff's debut self-titled album.

His father was Friedrich Jakob Behrend, a German physician. He finished his studies in his native city at the university. He became \\"Gerichtsassessor\\" in 1859; but, deciding upon a scholastic career, he became privatdozent at the Berlin University in 1864. The first-fruit of his research was the Magdeburger Fragen, edited by him, and published in Berlin, 1865. This 300-page treatise is a critical treatment of the manuscripts which are in existence under this name, and are traced by him to a Prussian origin of about the period from 1386 to 1402, and dealing with the \\"Schöffen-Recht.\\" The next product of his industry in the same direction was Ein Stendaler Urtheilsbuch aus dem 14ten Jahrhundert, Berlin, 1868. This consists of thirty- one decisions of the Magdeburger Schöffenstuhl, published for the first time from a manuscript in the Royal Library, Berlin. Each decision is furnished with an exhaustive commentary. It was received by juridical scholars as a perfect model of such work. Behrend became associate professor of jurisprudence at Berlin University in 1870. In the following year he assumed the editorial management of the Zeitschrift für die Deutsche Gesetzgebung und für Einheitliches Deutsches Recht. In 1873 Felix Dahn was associated with him in this magazine, the title of which was changed in 1875 to Zeitschrift für Gesetzgebung und Rechtspflege in Preussen. A treatise by him, Zum Prozess der Lex Salica, appeared in the Festgaben für A. W. Heffter, Berlin, 1873; and in the same year he issued his masterly contribution to the literature of the law of stock corporations, Ein Gutachten über die Aktiengesellschaften, which was published in the Schriften des Vereins für Social-Politik, Leipzig, 1873. That year was memorable, too, for his having received a call from the University of Greifswald as professor of jurisprudence, which he accepted. His next important production, and probably his most substantial contribution of permanent value, to legal literature is the Lex Salica, Nebst den Capitularien zur Lex Salica, bearbeitet von Alf. Boretius, xxiii. 164, Berlin, 1874. The scholarly and exhaustive manner in which Behrend proposed the task of editing critically the manuscripts of this code of laws of the early Franks is attested by the fact that a revised and enlarged edition was issued twenty- three years later; viz., at Weimar in 1897. In 1880 the publication of Behrend's Lehrbuch des Handelsrechts, designed to be comprised in two volumes, was begun in serial form by the issue of the first Lieferung of 192 pages. Its great importance was immediately recognized as being the first comprehensive scientific exposition of German commercial law. The production of this vast undertaking was, however, a slow process. In sixteen years six parts were issued, completing the first volume of nearly 1,000 pages. Another of Behrend's works worthy of mention is Anevang und Erbengewere, Berlin, 1885. In 1888 he received the appointment of \\"Reichsgerichtsrath\\" in Leipzig, a judicial position in the highest court in Germany. The Order of the Red Eagle (second class) was conferred upon Behrend in October 1900.

Typically sold in pet stores and supermarkets, it is usually specific to the type of animal, such as dog food or cat food. Most meat used for nonhuman animals is a byproduct of the human food industry, and is not regarded as \\"human grade\\".Hickman, Leo. Britain's problem with pets, The Guardian, November 13, 2009. In 2018, the world pet food market was valued at US$87.08 billion and is projected to grow to US$113.2 billion by the year 2024. The pet food market is dominated by five major companies, as of 2019: Mars, Inc., Nestle Purina Petcare, J. M. Smucker, Hill's Pet Nutrition, Inc. (owned by Colgate-Palmolive), and Blue Buffalo Co. Ltd (owned by General Mills). Industry In the United States, pet-food sales in 2016 reached an all-time high of $28.23 billion. Mars is the leading company in the pet food industry, making about $17 billion annually in pet- care products. Online sales of pet food are increasing and contributing to this growth. Online sales in the US increased 15 percent in 2015. Worldwide, the compound annual growth rate of pet food purchased online was more than 25% between 2013–2018. the US leads the world in pet-food spending. Formulations of mainstream commercial pet foods are generally based on nutrition research and many manufacturers undertake animal nutrition studies. For instance, Mars, Incorporated funds the Waltham Centre for Pet Nutrition, which undertakes scientific research into pet nutrition and wellbeing, sharing its findings in publicly available peer-reviewed journals.  Impact  Given the carnivorous dietary habits of many pets (especially cats and dogs), involving the consumption of an estimated fifth of the world's meat and fish, the impact of pet-food production on carbon footprints and on climate change becomes an issue. Fish food Fish foods normally contain macronutrients, trace elements and vitamins necessary to keep captive fish in good health. Approximately 80% of fishkeeping hobbyists feed their fish exclusively prepared foods that most commonly are produced in flake, pellet or tablet form. Pelleted forms, some of which sink rapidly, are often used for larger fish or bottom-feeding species such as loaches or catfish. Some fish foods also contain additives, such as beta carotene or sex hormones, to artificially enhance the color of ornamental fish. Bird food Bushtits eating suet from a bird feeder Bird foods are used both in birdfeeders and to feed pet birds. It typically consist of a variety of seeds. However, not all birds eat seeds. Nectar (essentially sugar water) attracts hummingbirds.What to Feed Birds Cat food pelleted cat food. Cats are obligate carnivores, though most commercial cat food contains both animal and plant material supplemented with vitamins, minerals and other nutrients. Cat food is formulated to address the specific nutritional requirements of cats, in particular containing the amino acid taurine, as cats cannot thrive on taurine-deficient food. Optimal levels of taurine for cat food have been established by the Waltham Centre for Pet Nutrition.Burger IH, Barnett KC. The taurine requirement of the adult cat. Journal of Small Animal Practice.1982;23:533-537. Dog food Recommendations differ on what diet is best for dogs. Some people argue dogs have thrived on leftovers and scraps from their human owners for thousands of years, and commercial dog foods (which have only been available for the past century) contain poor-quality meats, additives, and other ingredients dogs should not ingest, or that commercial dog food is not nutritionally sufficient for their dogs. However, many commercial brands are formulated using insights gained from scientific nutritional studiesAnderson RS, Blaza SE, Burger IH, Edney ATB. Content of commercial dog foods. Veterinary Record.1984;114(12):302-303. and there is no reliable peer-reviewed evidence that domestic options are superior. Most store-bought pet food comes in either dry form, also known as kibble, or wet, canned form. Raw feeding Raw feeding is the practice of feeding domestic dogs, cats and other animals a diet consisting primarily of uncooked meat, edible bones, and organs. The ingredients used to formulate raw diets can vary. Some pet owners choose to make home-made raw diets to feed their animals but commercial raw food diets are also available. The practice of feeding raw diets has raised some concerns due to the risk of food borne illnesses, zoonosis and nutritional imbalances. People who feed their dogs raw food do so for a multitude of reasons, including but not limited to: culture, beliefs surrounding health, nutrition and what is perceived to be more natural for their pets. Feeding raw food can be perceived as allowing the pet to stay in touch with their wild, carnivorous ancestry. The raw food movement has occurred in parallel to the change in human food trends for more natural and organic products. Feeding human foods to animals Prepared foods and some raw ingredients may be toxic for animals, and care should be taken when feeding animals leftover food. It is known that the following foods are potentially unsafe for cats, dogs and pigs: * Chocolate, coffee-based products and soft drinks * Raisins and grapes * Macadamia nuts * Garlic (in large doses) and onions * Alcohol Generally, cooked and marinated foods should be avoided, as well as sauces and gravies, which may contain ingredients that, although well tolerated by humans, may be toxic to animals. Xylitol, an alternative sweetener found in chewing gum and baked goods designed for diabetics, is highly toxic to cats, dogs, and ferrets. Labeling and regulation = United States = In the United States and its associated territories, all pet food is regulated by the Food and Drug Administration (FDA), the United States Department of Agriculture (USDA), and the Federal Trade Commission (FTC). It is further regulated at the state level.Government regulation of the pet food industry - Hillestad, Katharine State Department of Agriculture officials, major feed manufacturers, and ingredient suppliers form the Association of American Feed Control Officials (AAFCO), a non-government agency that establishes guidelines and standards on feed laws and regulations. Although government officials do comprise a large portion of AAFCO, it has no regulatory authority and acts simply as an advisory body, working closely with the FDA to develop standards that food consumed by animals must meet. AAFCO leaves the responsibility of regulating these standards to the individual states. Most states have adopted the guidelines set forth by AAFCO.Federal Drug Administration. (2018, Aug 1). Pet Food. Retrieved May 31, 2019, from https://www.fda.gov/animal-veterinary/animal-food-feeds/pet-food AAFCO requires that all pet food products sold in the United States have labels that contain eight components: # Brand and Product Name: These rules address the use of ingredient names in the product name. How ingredients may be included in the product name depends on the percentage of that ingredient in the product, and the use of certain descriptors. For example, there are different rules for \\"Beef Dog Food\\", \\"Beef Recipe Dog Food\\", \\"Dog Food with Beef\\" and \\"Beef Flavor Dog Food\\". # Name of Species for which the pet food is intended: This must be conspicuously designated in words on the principal display panel, but may be included in the product name, such as \\"Beef Dog Food\\" or \\"Salmon Treats for Cats\\". # Quantity Statement: This is the net weight or net volume, and it must be expressed in the correct units and placed on the lower third of the principal display panel. # Guaranteed Analysis: This lists the percentage of each of the nutrients in the food. The minimum percent of crude protein and crude fat, the maximum percent of crude fiber, and moisture are always required. Note that \\"crude\\" refers to the analysis method, rather than the quality of the nutrient. # Ingredient Statement: Ingredients must be listed in order of predominance by weight, on an \\"as formulated basis\\". The ingredient that makes up the highest percentage of the total weight as it goes into the product is listed first. # Nutritional Adequacy Statement: This is a statement that indicates the food is complete and balanced for a particular life stage, such as growth, reproduction, adult maintenance or a combination of these, or intended for intermittent or supplemental feeding only. AAFCO makes rules for nutrient levels required for such a statement. Products conspicuously identified on the principal display panel as a snack, treat, or supplement are exempt. # Feeding Directions: All pet foods labeled as complete and balanced for any or all life stages must include feeding directions that, at a minimum, state \\"Feed (amount of product) per (weight) of dog/cat\\". Feeding frequency must also be stated. Feeding directions are optional for treats, as long as they are labeled as snacks or treats. # Name and address of manufacturer or distributor: This names the pet food company as guarantor of the product and gives the company's location. If the company uses a separate manufacturer for actual production or distribution, the label must show that relationship by using the words \\"Manufactured for\\" or \\"Distributed by\\". Dog and cat foods labeled as \\"complete and balanced\\" must meet standards established by the AAFCO either by meeting a nutrient profile or by passing a feeding trial. Cat and dog food nutrient profiles were established by the AAFCO's Feline Nutrition Expert Subcommittee (1991–1992) and the Canine Nutrition Expert Subcommittee (1990–1991), respectively. The nutrient profiles were updated in 2016.Federal Drug Administration. (2018, March 23). \\"Complete and Balanced\\" Pet Food. Retrieved May 31, 2018, from https://www.fda.gov/animal- veterinary/animal-health-literacy/complete-and-balanced-pet-food Products found to be \\"complete and balanced\\" by feeding trials bear the label statement \\"animal feeding tests using AAFCO procedures substantiate that (name of product) provides complete and balanced nutrition.\\" The protocol requires six of eight animals complete a 26-week feeding trial without showing clinical or pathological signs of nutritional deficiency or excess. The cats' or dogs' general health is evaluated by a veterinarian before and after the test. Four blood values (hemoglobin, packed cell volume, serum alkaline phosphatase and serum albumin) are measured after the trial, and the average values of the test subjects must meet minimum levels. No animal is allowed to lose more than 15% of its starting weight. Products formulated with ingredients to meet the established nutrient profile would include the following statement, \\"(Name of product) is formulated to meet the nutritional levels established by the AAFCO Cat/Dog Food Nutrient Profiles.\\" There are two separate nutrient profiles - one for \\"growth and reproduction\\" and one for \\"adult maintenance\\". The nutritional adequacy statement would include information on the life stage(s) for which the product is suitable. A product labeled as \\"for all life stages\\" must meet the more stringent nutrient profile for \\"growth and reproduction\\". Products labeled as \\"intended for intermittent or supplemental feeding\\" do not need to meet either profile. The \\"Family Rule\\" allows a manufacturer to have a product that is \\"nutritionally similar\\" to another product in the same \\"family\\" to adopt the latter's \\"complete and balanced\\" statement without itself undergoing any feeding tests. The \\"similar\\" food must be of the same processing type; contain the same moisture content; bear a statement of nutritional adequacy for the same or less demanding life stage as the lead product; contain a dry matter, metabolizable energy (ME) content within 7.5% of the lead product's dry matter; meet the same levels of crude protein, calcium, phosphorus, zinc, lysine, thiamine (and for cat foods, potassium and taurine) as the lead food; and meet or exceed the nutrient levels and ratios of the lead family product or the AAFCO nutrient profiles, whichever is lower. The label statement on the similar food can be the same as the lead product if the ME is substantiated by the 10-day ME feeding study. Critics of the AAFCO standards argue that such requirements are too lax. Generational studies conducted by researchers at University of California, Davis have shown some foods that pass AAFCO's feeding trials are still not suitable for long-term use and estimated that of 100 foods that pass the nutritional analysis, 10 to 20 would not pass the feeding trials. Although maximum levels of intake of some nutrients have been established because of concerns with overnutrition, many still lack a maximum allowed level and some contains large disparity between maximum and minimum values. The NRC accepts that despite ongoing research, large gaps still exist in the knowledge of quantitative nutritional information for specific nutrients.National Research Council. 2006. Nutrient Requirements of Dogs and Cats. Some professionals acknowledge the possibilities of phytochemicals and other vital nutrients that have yet to be recognized as essential by nutritional science. With such broad guidelines and loose feeding trial standards, critics argue that the term \\"complete and balanced\\" is inaccurate and even deceptive. An AAFCO panel expert has stated that \\"although the AAFCO profiles are better than nothing, they provide false securities.\\" Certain manufacturers label their products with terms such as premium, ultra premium, and holistic. Such terms currently have no official definitions. The AAFCO is currently considering defining some of the terms. However, the terms \\"natural\\" and \\"organic\\" do have definitions; e.g., organic products must meet the same USDA regulations as for organic human food. = Canada = In Canada, products that pass the Canadian Veterinary Medical Association (CVMA) Pet Food Certification Program, which involves a feeding trial, carry a CVMA label on their packaging. Participation in the program is voluntary. The program was discontinued at the end of 2007.Pet food package labels show AAFCO compliance There is no government regulation of pet food manufactured in Canada. However, imported pet food does receive stringent oversight. = European Union = In the European Union, pet food is regulated by the same harmonized standards across the EU, via the Feeding Stuffs Act.Guidance Notes - Food Standards Agency All ingredients used for pet food have to be fit for human consumption according to EU requirements. But regulations require that pet food that contains by-products be labeled as \\"Not for human consumption\\" even though such by-products have to be derived from animals declared fit for human consumption. Raw pet food has to be labeled \\"Pet food only\\".EU Pet food Legislation: Pet food Ingredient Requirements U.S. Mission to the European Union Products meant for daily feeding are labeled \\"complete feedingstuff\\" or \\"complete petfood\\" or other EU languages equivalent. Products meant for intermittent feeding are labeled \\"complementary feedingstuff or \\"complementary pet food\\" while products with an ash content of over 40% are labeled \\"mineral feedingstuff\\". Ingredients are listed in descending order by weight.EU Pet food Legislation: Pet food Labeling Requirements U.S. Mission to the European Union With the released Commission Regulation (EU) No 107/2013, the European Union has set new maximum levels for melamine in canned pet food. According to results of an in-depth research of the 2007 pet food crisis, melamine used in coatings for pet food cans can migrate into the food. Therefore, the regular melamine migration limit (SML) of 2.5 mg/kg for food and feed has been expanded to pet food. This limit is valid for canned wet pet food on an ‘as sold’ basis.Commission Regulation (EU) No 107/2013 European Commission, Retrieved 04/22/2013 The European Union does not use a unified nutrient requirement. A manufacturer committee called FEDIAF (European Pet Food Industry Federation) makes recommendations for cats and dogs that members follow. 2007 recalls Beginning in March 2007, there were massive recalls of many brands of cat and dog foods. The recalls came in response to reports of kidney failure in pets consuming mostly wet pet foods made with wheat gluten from a single Chinese company, beginning in February 2007. After more than three weeks of complaints from consumers, the recall began voluntarily with the Canadian company Menu Foods on March 16, 2007, when a company test showed sickness and death in some of the test animals. Soon after, there were numerous media reports of animal deaths as a result of kidney failure, and several other companies who received the contaminated wheat gluten also voluntarily recalled dozens of pet food brands. Menu Foods recalled almost over 50 brands of dog food, and over 40 brands of cat food. Nestlé Purina PetCare withdrew all sizes and varieties of Alpo \\"Prime Cuts in Gravy\\". Some companies were not affected and utilized the situation to generate sales for alternative pet foods. By the end of March, veterinary organizations reported more than 100 pet deaths amongst nearly 500 cases of kidney failure, with one online database self-reporting as many as 3,600 deaths as of April 11. As of April 8, Menu Foods has confirmed only about 16 deaths. The U.S. Food and Drug Administration refuses to estimate the amount of sick or dead because there is no centralized government records database of animal sickness or death in the United States as there are with humans (such as the Centers for Disease Control). As a result, many sources speculate that the actual number of affected pets may never be known and experts are concerned that the actual death toll could potentially reach into the thousands. Overall, several major companies have recalled more than 100 brands of pet foods, with most of the recalled product coming from Menu Foods. Although there are several theories of the source of the agent causing sickness in affected animals, with extensive government and private testing and forensic research, to date, no definitive cause has been isolated. As of April 10, the most likely cause, according to the FDA, though not yet proven, is indicated by the presence of melamine in wheat gluten in the affected foods. The Chinese company behind the contaminated wheat gluten has initially denied any involvement in the contamination, but is cooperating with Chinese and American investigators. In the United States, there has been extensive media coverage of the recall. There has been widespread public outrage and calls for government regulation of pet foods, which had previously been self- regulated by pet food manufacturers. The United States Senate held an oversight hearing on the matter by April 12. The economic impact on the pet food market has been extensive, with Menu Foods losing roughly $30 Million alone from the recall. The events have caused distrust of most processed pet foods in some consumers.

Students choose one primary language as a major from Chinese, French, Japanese, Spanish, or German to study during their three years at the school. Korean and English are mandatory subjects, regardless of which focus language students choose when entering the school. There does exist, however, an English department with submajors in Japanese and Chinese. Like most schools in Korea, Daewon starts its school year in March, starts its second semester in August, and ends the school year in February. There is a weeklong spring break in mid-February. Daewon is one of the four schools run by the Daewon Education Foundation, all of which share a campus in Junggok-dong, Gwangjin-gu, Seoul. The school's primary language of instruction is Korean.  History  = Origins = Dr. Lee Won Hee, Founder Daewon was founded in 1984 by Dr. Lee Won Hee, then an executive director at Samsung subsidiary Cheil Jedang. Lee had submitted plans for a private foreign language school to the government in 1982, beginning construction of the prospective school's campus expecting the charter to be approved. But when the Ministry of Education rejected his proposal, Daewon Girls' High School was established to take the place of the language school. The following year, however, Daewon's charter was approved, along with that of Daeil Foreign Language High School, and in 1984, the two opened their doors as the first two foreign language high schools in Korea.  Admissions  In 2011, Daewon put into effect an entirely new admissions procedure that effectively superseded the admissions examination. The change was mandated by a government directive that required all Special Purpose High Schools to select students based on a uniform two-step procedure that involved middle school English subject scores and a brief interview. The new system eliminated the English listening examination that had been the centerpiece of the previous admissions system, in addition to forbidding the school from considering students based on scores from other subjects or extracurricular achievements. This change followed another government mandate, which had in 2010 limited the area from which the school could receive applications to within the bounds of Seoul. These mandates were part of President Lee Myung-bak's education policy, which aimed to expand access to specialized secondary education. The policy has met with mixed results and reactions: while more students from financially challenged families could enter Daewon under the new quota system, the new system has also been widely criticized for being unable to accurately assess applicants' language abilities, since it is blind to certified language tests such as the TOEFL examination.  Academics  = Academic tracks = There are two academic tracks at Daewon FLHS, the Korean curriculum (\\"domestic\\") track and the Global Leadership Program (\\"international\\") track. Students are required to choose between the two upon application, but track transfers are permitted, though rare. In accordance with government mandates, the two tracks are now integrated, meaning that track divisions do not fall on department lines. The class of 2013 was the last class to be divided strictly upon track lines, with international track students forming the English department and domestic track students comprising the other language departments at Daewon. In 2015, the domestic-international track ratio is approximately 20:1.  Korean curriculum track  The majority of the school's students are enrolled in the Korean curriculum track, where they prepare for entrance into Korea's top universities, such as Seoul National University, Yonsei University and Korea University. Preparation involves rigorous cramming for the CSAT examination, as well as training for the nonsul examination, a written examination similar to the SAT's essay section. As Korean universities strengthen their emphasis on extracurricular activities and extracurricular academic achievement, domestic track students are beginning to emulate their peers in the Global Leadership Program (GLP), engaging in various club activities and preparing for Advanced Placement examinations.  Global Leadership Program (GLP)  Daewon FLHS hosts the Global Leadership Program (GLP), a special academic block scheduling course intended to prepare students for colleges abroad. GLP courses are centered on critical and academic use of the English language, with classes such as English Literature and English Composition. Since the first class of 2000, many GLP graduates have matriculated at US colleges and universities.Ellen Gamermann, \\"How to Get into Harvard,\\" Wall Street Journal, November 30, 2007  References  Category:High schools in Seoul Category:Gwangjin District Category:Educational institutions established in 1984 Category:Private schools in South Korea Category:Language high schools in South Korea Category:1984 establishments in South Korea ","title":"Daewon Foreign Language High School"},{"id":"3884749","text":"King Baudouin (protecting houses in Tournai) In Belgium, a Royal Decree (RD) or Royal Order () (Dutch), Arrêté Royal (French), or Königlicher Erlass (German) is a federal governmental decree exercising legislation, or powers the legislature has delegated to the crown as secondary legislation.

Such rhymes have been recorded in all cultures where skipping is played. Examples of English-language rhymes have been found going back to at least the 17th century. Like most folklore, skipping rhymes tend to be found in many different variations. The article includes those chants used by English-speaking children. History Explorers reported seeing aborigines jumping with vines in the 16th century. European boys started jumping rope in the early 17th century. The activity was considered indecent for girls because they might show their ankles. There were no associated chants. This changed in the early 18th century. Girls began to jump rope. They added the chants, owned the rope, controlled the game, and decided who participated. In the United States, domination of the activity by girls occurred when their families moved into the cities in the late 19th century. There, they found sidewalks and other smooth surfaces conducive to jumping rope, along with a host of contemporaries. Another source suggests that, prior to 1833, the invention of pantalettes enabled girls to jump rope without displaying ankles. Chants are intended to structure the game and are secondary, explaining the nonsense or irrational lyrics. These chants are unusual inasmuch as they were transmitted from child to child usually without an underlying reason, as opposed to nursery rhymes which were transmitted from adult to child and often contained a moral. Chants may contain girlish references to boyfriends or marriage. Examples of chants Two girls with a long rope stood about apart and turned the rope as other children took turns jumping. If one were not a good jumper, one would be an 'Ever-Laster,' that is, one would perpetually turn the rope. When it was a child's turn to jump, she would enter as the rope turned, and jump to the rhyme until she missed. Then she would become a rope-turner, and the next child in line would take her place. =Jump in, jump out = For a line of potential jumpers, the jumpers were restricted on time by the length of the chant/ They jumped in at the beginning, jumped out at the end and the next jumper took their turn. :Charlie Chaplin went to France :To teach the ladies how to dance. :First the heel, then the toe, :Then the splits, and around you go! :Salute to the Captain, :Bow to the Queen, :And turn your back on the Nazi submarine! In another version, the teacher is \\"Benjamin Franklin.\\" In the Charlie Chaplin rhyme, the child jumping had to follow directions as the rope was turning: touching the heel of one foot on the ground; touching the toe of the same foot on the ground; doing a (short) split of the feet, turning around, saluting, bowing, and jumping out from the turning rope on the last line. This rhyme, c. 1942, reflects children's awareness of World War II (The Queen to whom we bowed was the mother of the present British Queen). An Australian version of the Charlie Chaplin Skipping Song, as sung at Salisbury Primary School in Brisbane, Australia in the mid 1950s, is as follows: :Charlie Chaplin went to France, :To teach the ladies how to dance, :First he did the Rumba, :Then he did the twist, :Then he did the Highland Fling, :And then he did the splits. There's also \\"Betty Grable went to France,/To teach the soldiers how to dance.\\" (The rest is the same.) :Had a little car car, :Two-forty-eight, :Ran around the cor-(skipper jumps out, and turners continue the syllable until they reenter)-ner :and slammed on the brakes, but the brakes didn't work, :So I bumped into a lady who bumped into a man, :Who bumped into a police car, man, oh man! :Policeman caught me :Put me on his knee, :Asked me a question :Will you marry me? :Yes, No, Maybe So (repeated) :All in together, birds of a feather: :January, February, March, April, May, etc. (each child had to jump in during the month they were born). :I see London, I see France, :I see (xxx)s underpants, :Not too big, not too small, :Just the size of Montreal (or just the size of cannonball, Berlin Wall, etc.) Another variation: : I see London, I see France, I see (xxx)s underpants. : Are they blue? Are they pink? I don't know but they sure stink! : Teacher, teacher, I declare, I see (xxx)s underwear (or bottoms bare) Political statement In Dublin, Ireland, the visits of inspectors known as \\"Glimmer men\\" to private houses to enforce regulations to prevent the use of coal gas in restricted hours during the Emergency gave rise to: :Keep it boiling on the glimmer, if you don't you get no dinner. =Counting rhymes= Most rhymes are intended to count the number of jumps the skipper takes without stumbling. These were essentially restricted to times when there were relatively few jumpers and time was abundant. These rhymes can take very simple forms. This chant was collected in London in the 1950s: :Big Ben strikes one, :Big Ben strikes two, :Big Ben strikes three, :(etc.) and :Applesauce, mustard, cider\\"Search results for 'home'\\" in The James T. Callow Folklore Archive, at Research.UDMercy.edu. Accessed: December 6, 2017. :How many legs has a spider? :1, 2, 3, etc. alternately, \\"Salt, vinegar, mustard, pepper. How many legs does a spider have? 1,2,3, etc.\\" :Butterfly, butterfly: turn around. [jumper turns while jumping]\\"All Jump Rope Rhymes\\", Mudcat.org. Accessed: December 6, 2017. :Butterfly, butterfly: touch the ground [jumper touches the ground as she is jumping] :Butterfly, butterfly: show your shoe. [..thrusts out her shoe] :Butterfly, butterfly: [n] to do. :One, two, three, ... [up to the count of n, which increases by 1 with each set of jumpers] Another rendition substitutes, \\"teddy bear\\" for \\"butterfly. This can be dated no earlier than the early 20th century, to the term of Theodore Roosevelt. In another skipping rhyme, once the alphabet finishes, participants continue with numbers until skipper catches rope. It is natural for participants to use the letter that the skipper lost on and to use it to find someone's name following the rule of either best friend or boyfriend, depending on what is chosen in the beginning. :Ice cream, Soda pop, cherry on top, :Who's your best friend, let's find out; :Goes A! B! C! or :Ice cream soda, cherry on top :Who's your boyfriend/girlfriend, I forgot; :Is it an A! B! C! or :Ice cream sundae, banana split :[Name of jumper]'s got a boyfriend/girlfriend, :Who is it? :A! B! C! or :Ice cream soda, Delaware Punch, :Tell me the name of my honey-bunch. :A, B, C, etc. Another counting rhyme: :Cinderella dressed in yellow, went upstairs (or downstairs) to kiss her fellow, by mistake kissed a snake, how many doctors will it take? 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10 etc. (Go to 20 then go down to the next line) :Cinderella dressed in blue, went upstairs to tie her shoe, made a mistake and tied a knot, how many knots will she make? 1, 2, 3, etc. :Cinderella dressed in green, went downtown to buy a ring, made a mistake and bought a fake, how many days before it breaks? 1, 2, 3, etc. :Cinderella dressed in lace, went upstairs to fix her face, oh no oh no, she found a blemish, how many powder puffs till she's finished? 1, 2, 3, etc. :Cinderella dressed in silk, went outside to get some milk, made a mistake and fell in the lake, how many more till she gets a break? 1, 2, 3, etc. The counting continues as long as the jumper avoids faulting. If they do then the counting starts again.: =Miscellaneous= *Skipping rhymes need not always have to be rhymes, however. They can be games, such as a game called, \\"School.\\" In \\"Kindergarten\\" (the first round), all skippers must run through rope without skipping. In \\"First Grade\\", all skippers must skip in, skip once, and skip out without getting caught in the rope, and so on. Also, there is \\"Mouse Trap\\", where there is a special pattern, and players must run through rope without getting caught. If caught, the jumper caught must hold the rope. \\"Diamonds\\" pattern (the letters spelling \\"Diamond\\" are chanted)Horowitz, Gayle L. (2009). International Games: Building Skills Through Multicultural Play, p.70. Human Kinetics. . Chinese jump rope patterns are often accompanied by chants. The diamonds pattern is accompanied by the letters which spell \\"diamond\\" (\\"D-I-A-M-O-N-D-S.\\"), while the Americans pattern, as are many patterns, is accompanied by the names of the moves made while carrying out the pattern (\\"right, left, right, left, in, out/open, in, on.\\"). =Speed rhymes= Some rhymes are intended to test the agility of the jumper by turning the rope more rapidly. The key word to start turning fast is often \\"pepper\\" to indicate speed, such as: :Mable, Mable, :Set the table, :Don't forget the salt, :Vinegar, :Mustard, :Pepper! (rapid turning follows)Oliver, Ray. \\"The Games\\", The History of the Olivers of Broken Hill. Accessed: December 6, 2017. *When \\"RED HOT PEPPERS\\" was called, the turners would turn the rope as fast as they could. =Pretty Little Dutch Girl= \\"Pretty Little Dutch Girl\\" was a lengthy song, much too long for a simple chant, but often excerpted for jumping rope. \\"My husband's name is Fatty. He comes from Cincinnati.\\" Or alphabetical, \\"My husband's name is Alfred, He comes from Atlanta, He works in the attic..\\" All made up on the spur of the moment. The jumper may be obliged to jump out upon finishing a letter, or be allowed to continue until either failing to invent new lyrics, or faulting. =Historical rhymes= Other rhymes are highly topical, and sometimes survive long after the events that inspired them have disappeared from the headlines. Perhaps the most notorious rhyme of this type is one that began circulating during the 1892 trial of Lizzie Borden. Despite Lizzie's desire to stay out of the public eye, children would follow her around and chant the rhyme. It later started being used as a rhyme used when skipping-rope: :Lizzie Borden took an axe :She gave her mother forty whacks, :After she saw what she had done, :She gave her father forty-one. :Lizzie Borden got away, :For her crime she did not pay. *Variations of this following rhyme, a wordplay on \\"influenza,\\" were heard around the time of the 1918 flu pandemic: :I had a little bird, :And its name was Enza. :I opened the window :And in-flew-enza. This one from Prohibition: :No, I won't go to Casey's any more, more, more, :There's a big fat policeman by the door, door, door. :He grabs you by the collar, :And makes you pay a dollar. :No, I won't go to Casey's any more.

New York City Transit Authority is a lawsuit in which a woman who laid down on subway tracks in 2000 in an apparent suicide attempt was first awarded over after a train hit her. The New York City Transit Authority appealed, and in 2006 the New York Supreme Court Appellate Division, First Department overturned the jury verdict and dismissed the case. Context On May 3, 2000, Seong Sil Kim lay down on the subway tracks just north of 34th Street on the West Side of Manhattan. Soon, she was hit by an train and was nearly killed. She suffered traumatic amputation of the right hand except for the thumb; multiple skull and facial bone fractures; fractures to the right radius; fractured left toes; and lacerations of the face, abdomen, and leg, resulting in permanent scarring.New York Law Journal, June 10, 2002. Kim then sued the New York City Transit Authority for negligence and substantial damages. Lawsuit In the subsequent trial, it was revealed that a passenger called '9-1-1' about six minutes before the accident, saying that he had seen a person lying on the tracks. Train operators were notified immediately, and the driver of the E train was moving between when he saw Kim and tried to stop the train before reaching her. That was an appropriate speed for the New York City Subway \\"caution\\" alert under which his train was operating. However, Kim's lawyers presented an expert witness who calculated that the operator should have been able to stop his train in time had he been going or less, under an \\"extreme caution\\" alert. Through a translator, Kim claimed to have no memory of how she ended up on the tracks. However, she was north of the platform, so she could not have fallen there. She lay on the tracks in the tunnel for at least 24 minutes before her encounter with the train. Kim had given birth two months before the event, and the city submitted evidence that she was suffering from postpartum depression. Kim initially won her lawsuit, and a sympathetic jury awarded her $14.1 million. However, the judge reduced the amount because the jury apportioned Kim with 30% responsibility for her own injury, leaving her with $9.9 million. Her lawyer, David Dean, of the law firm of Sullivan Papain Block McGrath & Cannavo, said, \\"How she got there was less important than the obligations of the operator. You still have an obligation to operate a train safely, and this guy just didn't.\\" Following a post-trial motion, the damage award was further reduced to $5 million. Finally in 2006, a panel of appellate judges ruled 4–1 that there was legally insufficient evidence to support a finding of Transit Authority negligence or to establish which of several possible trains caused Kim's injuries. The trial judge was reversed, the jury verdict vacated, and the complaint dismissed.

With the death of Bowie in January 2016, Woodmansey is the last surviving member of the Ziggy Stardust studio band. In May 1978, he became drummer to the band Screen Idols, who had success with two albums in the UK. Career Woodmansey joined Bowie's backing group The Hype, which later became The Spiders from Mars. He played on Bowie's albums The Man Who Sold the World (1970), Hunky Dory (1971), The Rise and Fall of Ziggy Stardust and the Spiders from Mars (1972) and Aladdin Sane (1973). Woodmansey was replaced in The Spiders from Mars by Aynsley Dunbar, who played on Bowie's next album, the 1973 covers album Pin Ups. Woodmansey re-formed The Spiders from Mars for one album, along with bass player Trevor Bolder. This necessitated a change of personnel, with Dave Black on lead guitar because Mick Ronson was unavailable and Pete McDonald supplying lead vocals. Guest keyboardist was Mike Garson, who had been a major part of Bowie's line-up from the Ziggy Stardust days. Bowie made no contribution to the album which was named The Spiders From Mars. After the final disbandment of the Spiders, he formed his own band, Woody Woodmansey's U-Boat, with Phil Murray, Frankie Marshall, Phil Plant and eventually Martin Smith, releasing a debut album U Boat in 1977. The album was subsequently re-released in 2006 as Woody Woodmansey's U-Boat (Castle Music ESMCD895). Woodmansey has also played with Art Garfunkel. He played in the band Cybernauts, and is currently the featured drummer with 3-D. He also co-leads, with Tony Visconti, the supergroup Holy Holy, performing David Bowie songs from the 1970s, including the full The Man Who Sold the World album. Woodmansey toured with Holy Holy in September 2014, and followed up with tours of the UK, USA and Japan during the following two years. The group has featured Erdal Kızılçay, Glenn Gregory, Steve Norman, Marc Almond and James Stevenson. Woodmansey published his autobiography Spider From Mars: My Life With David Bowie in 2016. It was co- written with author Joel McIver and includes a foreword by Bowie's producer and friend Tony Visconti.

He became governor in 1727. His governorship was marked by the arrival of the first Ursuline nuns in New Orleans in 1727 to establish the first convent within the limits of what was to become the United States as well as a war against the Natchez Indians due to bad relations with the Sieur de Chépart, the commander at Fort Rosalie. After agitating the Indians by demanding that they give up either their village or their land, the Indians launched an attack on November 29, 1729, and killed nearly three hundred persons at Fort Rosalie. The French retaliated and by 1731 had killed or captured most of the Indians. The captured Indians were sent as slaves to Santo Domingo, and the few remaining free moved further westward and joined the Chickasaw Indians. This marked the end of the Natchez Indian nation. In the same year, the Company of the Indies petitioned the King of France to take back their charter, thus ending their control of the colony. Étienne de Perier remained governor for two years after Louisiana was returned to the Crown but became frustrated with deteriorating relations with the Chickasaws and lost interest in the colony. He resigned, and Jean-Baptiste le Moyne de Bienville was chosen to yet again serve as governor of the colony. References *Davis, Edwin Adams. Louisiana the Pelican State.

The chiefs of the clan were the Barons of Roslin and later the Earls of Orkney and Earls of Caithness. The Sinclairs are believed to have come from Normandy to England during the Norman conquest of England, before arriving in Scotland in the 11th century. The Sinclairs supported the Scottish Crown during the Scottish–Norwegian War and the Wars of Scottish Independence. The chiefs were originally Barons of Roslin, Midlothian and William Sinclair, 1st Earl of Caithness and Baron of Roslin founded the famous Rosslyn Chapel in the 15th century. He split the family lands, disinheriting his eldest son from his first marriage, William (\\"the Waster\\"), who later became the second Lord Sinclair, instead giving the lands of Caithness to the second son from his second marriage, William Sinclair, 2nd Earl of Caithness, in 1476, and the lands at Roslin to his eldest son from his second marriage, Sir Oliver Sinclair. In the 16th century the Sinclairs fought against England during the Anglo-Scottish Wars and also feuded with their neighbors the Clan Sutherland. During the Jacobite rising of 1715 the Sinclairs supported the Jacobite cause, but during the Jacobite rising of 1745, while the clan largely had Jacobite sympathies, their chief, the Earl of Caithness, supported the British-Hanoverian Government. The current chief is Malcolm Sinclair, 20th Earl of Caithness. History =Origins of the clan= No certain record exists but it is likely that the Sinclairs came from Saint-Clair in Normandy. The Saint-Clairs first went to England (before they came to Scotland) with William the Conqueror during his invasion of England. The name was originally \\"Saint-Clair\\" which was a place name. Richard of Saint-Clair and Brittel of Saint-Clair are both mentioned in the Domesday Book. William of Saint-Clair accompanied Saint Margaret of Scotland, daughter of Edward the Exile to Scotland in 1068, where she eventually married Malcolm III of Scotland. In return for his efforts, the king supposedly granted Sinclair the barony of Roslin, Scotland \\"in free heritage\\". One of the earliest recorded Sinclairs in Scotland was Henry of Saint-Clair/Sinclair, who obtained a charter for the lands of Herdmanston in Haddingtonshire in 1160. The chiefs of Clan Sinclair, the Earls of Caithness, descend from Sir William St Clare who was sheriff of Edinburgh and who was granted the barony of Roslin (Rosslyn) in 1280. =Scottish–Norwegian War= During the Scottish–Norwegian War, Haakon IV of Norway invaded Scotland. However, at the Battle of Largs in 1263 he was faced with William St. Clair who commanded a wing of Alexander III of Scotland's army. In 1264, William St. Clair was ordered by King Alexander of Scotland to support the forces of the king of England at the Battle of Lewes. =Wars of Scottish Independence= Interior of Rosslyn Chapel which was founded by William Sinclair, 1st Earl of Caithness During the Wars of Scottish Independence, Sir William Sinclair of Rosslyn was captured at the Battle of Dunbar (1296) and died later, probably in the Tower of London. Henry, his son, was also captured and later sent to St Briavels Castle, and in 1296 he swore fealty to Edward I of England. In 1303 the Battle of Roslin took place where Scots under Henry Sinclair of Rosslyn and the Clan Comyn defeated an English force. The Battle of Loudoun Hill took place in 1307 where Scots under Robert the Bruce, assisted by Henry Sinclair of Rosslyn again defeated the English. The family initially favoured John Balliol's claim to the throne but later it became paramount that they gave their loyalty to Robert the Bruce. The Battle of Bannockburn was fought in 1314, where the Clan Sinclair fought in support of Robert the Bruce. After the battle Robert the Bruce gave William Sinclair his sword. The Battle of Donibristle took place in 1317, William Sinclair, Bishop of Dunkeld, rallied the Scots army to defeat an English invading force in Fife. Sir William Sinclair, heir to Henry, and, it is claimed, his brother John, were among the Scots killed with Sir James Douglas at the Battle of Teba (1330), cutting short their attempt to carry Robert Bruce's heart to the Holy Land. They, or at least their bones, are said to be buried in Rosslyn Chapel. The Battle of Neville's Cross took place in 1346 where Sir John Sinclair of Herdmanston was taken prisoner =Later 14th century= In 1379, Sir Henry Sinclair, who was also Admiral of Scotland claimed the Earldom of Orkney through his mother and received it from Haakon VI of Norway. However the earldom of Orkney was later resigned by order of James III of Scotland. Henry I Sinclair, Earl of Orkney, Baron of Roslin, and Lord of Shetland (c.1345-c.1400), was a Scottish explorer nobleman. In 1391, he conquered the Faroe Islands. He is also alleged to have voyaged as far as the Americas in 1398 (being hypothetically identified with Zichmni, who travelled with the Zeno brothers, for the first time by Johann Reinhold Forster in 1784Johann Reinhold Forster, Geschichte der Entdeckungen und Schiffahrten im Norden, Frankfurt an der Oder, C.G. Strauss, 1784.); believers in this hypothesis claim he possibly landed in both Massachusetts and Nova Scotia.Frederick J. Pohl, Prince Henry Sinclair: His Expedition to the New World in 1398 (1974; 1998).Earl Henry Sinclair's fictitious trip to America by Brian Smith, First published in New Orkney Antiquarian Journal, vol. 2, 2002. The voyage to America is largely disputed.Fred W. Lucas, The Annals of The Voyages of The Brothers Nicolo and Antonio Zeno in The North Atlantic about the End of the Fourteenth Century and the Claim founded thereon to a Venetian Discovery of America: A Criticism and an Indictment (Stevens, 1898). According to a biography published many years after his death, he died in battle against the English around the year 1400. =15th century= Henry II Sinclair, Earl of Orkney was taken prisoner by the English at Battle of Homildon Hill in 1402 but was soon released. In 1406 he escorted Prince James to France but the ship was captured by the English and both were imprisoned in the Tower of London. In 1407 he escaped or was released on payment of a ransom. William Sinclair, 1st Earl of Caithness (3rd Earl of Orkney and Baron of Roslin) was High Chancellor of Scotland between 1454 and 1458. He had been granted the earldom of Caithness in 1455. He split the family lands, disinheriting his eldest son from his first marriage, William (\\"the Waster\\"), who later became the second Lord Sinclair, instead giving the lands of Caithness to the second son from his second marriage, William Sinclair, 2nd Earl of Caithness, in 1476, and the lands at Roslin to his eldest son from his second marriage, Sir Oliver Sinclair. =16th century= William Sinclair, 2nd Earl of Caithness was killed fighting for James IV of Scotland at the Battle of Flodden in 1513. There was a loss of 300 Sinclairs including George Sinclair of Keiss, Henry 3rd Lord Sinclair, Sir John Sinclair of Herdmanston, The Bishop of Caithness as well as James IV of Scotland. John Sinclair, 3rd Earl of Caithness (1490–1529) died at the Battle of Summerdale in May 1529, leading 500 men to help James Sinclair defend Orkney. He was succeeded by his son George Sinclair 4th Earl of Caithness. William, 4th Lord Sinclair was taken prisoner. At the Battle of Solway Moss in 1552, Scots commanded by Oliver Sinclair of Pitcairns were beaten by the English. In 1568, Henry 3rd Lord Sinclair assisted Mary, Queen of Scots, to escape from Loch Leven Castle. In 1570, John Sinclair, Master of Caithness, son of George Sinclair, 4th Earl of Caithness burned the local Cathedral in pursuit of the Morays who had taken refuge in the steeple. George Sinclair, 4th Earl of Caithness later imprisoned his son, the Master of Caithness, for making peace with the Morays. In 1588 Castle Sinclair Girnigoe withstood a siege by the Earl of Sutherland and in 1590 George Sinclair, 5th Earl of Caithness invaded Sutherland which resulted in the Battle of Clynetradwell. On 3 April 1593, George, 5th Earl of Caithness resigned his earldom in return for novodamus and remainder to his son William Sinclair. On 11 December William Sinclair of Mey was knighted by King James VI of Scotland. =17th century and Civil War= A Victorian era, romanticised depiction of a member of the clan by R. R. McIan, from The Clans of the Scottish Highlands, published in 1845. On 21 October 1601, Henry 5th Lord Sinclair died and was succeeded by grandson Henry. In 1606, George 5th Earl of Caithness, was by an Act of Parliament allowed to change the name of Girnigoe Castle to Sinclair Castle. See: Castle Sinclair Girnigoe. The Battle of Kringen took place on 26 August 1612 in Otta, Norway. George Sinclair was killed with most of his men in an ambush. In 1650 Major Sinclair assisted James Graham, 1st Marquess of Montrose at the Battle of Carbisdale where they were defeated. They escaped to Ardvreck Castle, but there they were betrayed by MacLeod of Assynt and were executed. Sir William Sinclair of Rosslyn was killed at the Battle of Dunbar (1650) and was the last knight to be buried in full armour below Rosslyn Chapel. General Monck sacked Rosslyn Castle but the Chapel was spared. In 1651, at the Battle of Worcester, John 9th Lord Sinclair was captured by Cromwell's forces and imprisoned in the Tower of London and then at Windsor Castle until 1660 when he was liberated by General Monck. In 1657, George Sinclair 6th Earl of Caithness was present when Oliver Cromwell was proclaimed Chief Magistrate of the three nations in Edinburgh. In 1680 a feud took place between George Sinclair of Keiss and Sir John Campbell of Glenorchy over the right to the lands and title of the earldom of Caithness. This resulted in the Battle of Altimarlach, where, legend has it that so many Sinclairs were killed that the Campbells were able to cross the river without getting their feet wet. Clearly, however, the Sinclairs had influence in high places as only a few years later, in 1681, they regained the earldom by an order of Parliament. In 1698, George Sinclair 7th Earl of Caithness died. He was succeeded by John Sinclair of Murchill (Murkle) 8th Earl, his cousin. =18th century and Jacobite risings= Sinclair dress tartan (modern) During the Jacobite rising of 1715 the Clan Sinclair supported the Jacobite cause, however by the time of the Jacobite rising of 1745 the Clan Sinclair supported the British Hanoverian Government. Jacobite rising of 1715 In 1708, Chief John, Master of Sinclair (Son of Henry Lord Sinclair) after killing two men in duels was exiled to Prussia but later pardoned by Anne, Queen of Great Britain. In 1715, John Master of Sinclair captured a vessel with 420 stand of arms bound for the Earl of Sutherland. In 1715, at the Battle of Sheriffmuir, David Sinclair of Brabsterdorran fought for Jacobite cause, as did John, Master of Sinclair who fled to Orkney and then to Europe. On 3 November 1733, John Sinclair of Murkle the younger son of John 8th Earl created Lord Murkle. In 1736, Sir James Sinclair glazed the windows for the first time of Rosslyn Chapel, relaid the floor with flagstones and repaired the roof of the chapel. In 1736, Sir James Sinclair of Rosslyn resigned his office as hereditary Grand Master Mason of Scotland to the Scottish Lodges on their foundation. He was later reappointed for his life. The Sinclairs of Roslin (Rosslyn) laid claim to be hereditary Grand Master Masons of Scotland. In 1739 forty-four Scottish Freemasons' Lodges met in Edinburgh to found the Grand Lodge of Scotland. William St Clair was a candidate for Grand Master and promptly became the first elected Grand Master after offering to surrender his hereditary rights. On 17 June 1739 Major Malcolm Sinclair 'A good and faithful servant of Sweden' was charged with affairs of State, he was assassinated at Grunberg in Silesia by agents of Tsaritsa Anna of Russia. Jacobite rising of 1745 On 4 June 1745, Sir James Sinclair of Rosslyn, a lieutenant general with the Royal Scots regiment, was appointed the commander of the British Forces in Flanders. On 16 April 1746, at the Battle of Culloden, he commanded the Royal Scots regiment on the British-Hanoverian Government side. The Jacobite rebel, John Mackenzie, Lord MacLeod, tried raising the Sinclairs in arms but had little success: only about thirty men under Sinclair of Scotscalder arrived at the place of muster, and Sinclair of Scotscalder's estates were later forfeited. However, the Clan Sinclair was strongly Jacobite, but after hearing the news of the Jacobite failure at the Battle of Culloden, this apparently made them \\"sneak home again\\". It was also reported that had Lord Sutherland and Lord Reay not been in their way then the Sinclairs would have been among the first of the rebels, with about 500 Caithness Sinclairs who were ready to join the Jacobites, although the Earl of Caithness, their chief, supported the British Government. When Duncan Forbes, Lord Culloden was forming the 18 Independent Highland Companies to oppose the Jacobite rising of 1745 the Sinclairs were not offered a company. In 1750, Sir William Sinclair of Dunbeath founded the Baptist church at Keiss. Castles The ruins of Roslin Castle, former seat of the Sinclair Barons of Roslin The ruins of Castle Sinclair Girnigoe as it appeared in 1821, historic seat of the Earls of Caithness, chiefs of Clan Sinclair The Castle of Mey, former seat of the Sinclairs of Mey The ruins of Ravenscraig Castle Castles that were either built by the Sinclairs or came into their possession have included amongst many others: *Roslin Castle, also known as Rosslyn Castle in Midlothian, is considered the earliest seat of the Sinclairs in Scotland. The ruins show that it was once a large, strong, princely stronghold. The main tower is ruinous, but a range that dates from the sixteenth century is almost complete. The keep was probably built by Sir William Sinclair who set out on a crusade with Robert the Bruce and was killed fighting the Moors in Granada in 1330. Roslin Castle was sacked and torched in 1544 by the Earl of Hertford. In 1650 it was attacked again by George Monck, 1st Duke of Albemarle during Oliver Cromwell's invasion. The castle was damaged by a mob of Covenanters in 1688. The castle is now owned by the Sinclair-Erskine family.The National Monuments Record of Scotland gives the original date of the castle as \\"around 1390\\", NMRS Site Reference NT26SE 21.00 . The Sinclairs also built the famed Rosslyn Chapel nearby. *Castle Sinclair Girnigoe, near Wick, Caithness was once thought of as two castles: Castle Sinclair and Castle Girnigoe, however later theories are that it was one large fortress. There is not much left of the part that is known as Castle Sinclair, but the Castle Girnigoe part is a substantial ruin that rises five stories on a cliff above the sea. The castle was damaged by the Clan Campbell when it was attacked after the Battle of Altimarlech in 1681. The castle is now in the care of the Clan Sinclair Trust. *Castle of Mey, north-east of Castletown, Caithness is a Z-plan tower house that rises six stories and dates from the sixteenth century. The castle was property of the Sinclair Earls of Caithness from 1566 and they built the castle. William Sinclair, son of George Sinclair of Mey, while a student at Edinburgh High School in 1595, shot and killed Bailie MacMorran in a siege at the school. MacLeod of Assynt who betrayed James Graham, 1st Marquess of Montrose was later imprisoned in the castle. In 1952 the castle was sold to Queen Elizabeth The Queen Mother who had it restored. *Ravenscraig Castle, near Kirkcaldy dates from the fifteenth century and is one of the first castles in Britain to have been built for both defensive and offensive artillery use. The Sinclairs received Ravenscraig after they resigned the Earldom of Orkney. They owned it until 1650 and it was the Sincalirs who completed the castle. The property later passed to the Sinclair-Erskine family and is now in the care of Historic Scotland who have opened it to the public. *Ackergill Tower, near Wick, Caithness, was seized by the Sinclairs in 1547 but later returned to the Clan Keith. It was acquired by the Sinclairs again in 1612. *Braal Castle, near Thurso, Caithness, is a ruinous castle that passed to the Sinclair Earls of Caithness by 1547 and then went to the Sincalirs of Ulbster. *Dunbeath Castle, near Dunbeath, Caithness, was acquired by the Sinclairs in the 15th century. *Keiss Castle, near Wick, Caithness, the original castle of which was held by the Sinclairs of Keiss until they abandoned it for new Keiss Castle in 1755. The old castle is now dangerously ruined. *Castle of Old Wick, near Wick, Caithness. During a feud between the Clan Sutherland and Clan Sinclair the castle was starved into submission by John Sinclair, Master of Caithness in 1595. It is now in the care of Historic Scotland. *Thurso Castle, near Thurso, Caithness is a ruinous mansion on the site of a castle. It was held by the Sinclairs of Greenland and Rattar in 1612.

It has been given various dates within the period of about 330 to 50 BC. It was excavated in Rome in 1885, and is now in the collection of the National Museum of Rome, normally displayed in the Palazzo Massimo alle Terme. The Boxer at Rest is one of the finest examples of bronze sculptures to have survived from the ancient world; survivals from the period are rare, as they were easily melted down and transformed into new objects. The work comes from a period in Greek art where there is a movement away from idealized heroic depictions of the body and youth, and an exploration of emotional as well as psychological themes and greater realism. These traits are typical of Hellenistic art and thoroughly displayed in this sculpture making it a hallmark of the Hellenistic style. Discovery The Boxer is one of two unrelated bronzes (the other being the unidentified Hellenistic Prince) discovered on the slopes of the Quirinal within a month of each other in 1885, possibly from the remains of the Baths of Constantine. It appears that both had been carefully buried in antiquity. The archaeologist Rodolfo Lanciani, who was present at the sculpture's discovery, wrote: > I have witnessed, in my long career in the active field of archaeology, many > discoveries; I have experienced surprise after surprise; I have sometimes > and most unexpectedly met with real masterpieces; but I have never felt such > an extraordinary impression as the one created by the sight of this > magnificent specimen of a semi-barbaric athlete, coming slowly out of the > ground, as if awakening from a long repose after his gallant > fights.Lanciani, Ancient Rome in Light of Recent Discoveries (1888:305–306), > quoted in Sean Hemingway, \\"The Boxer: an ancient masterpiece comes to the > Met\\", 2013; accessed 29 June 2013. View of the back of the sculpture Description Detail of the head The statue is a masterpiece of Hellenistic athletic professionalism, with a top- heavy over-muscled torso and scarred and bruised face, penis bound by a kynodesme, cauliflower ears, broken nose, and a mouth suggesting broken teeth. R.R.R. Smith believes that the statue does not show a true portrait: this is genre realism, individuality removed in favour of a generic character of \\"boxer\\". In 1989 both bronzes were meticulously conserved by Nikolaus Himmelmann, in preparation for their exhibition at the Akademisches Kunstmuseum in Bonn. The sculpture is soldered together from eight segments, separately cast through the lost-wax process; the joins have been filed and finished to be virtually invisible. The lips and wounds and scars about the face were originally inlaid with copper, and further copper inlays on the right shoulder, forearm, caestus and thigh represented drops and trickles of blood. The fingers and toes were worn from being rubbed by passers-by in ancient times, which has suggested that the Boxer was carefully buried to preserve its talismanic value, when the Baths were abandoned after the Goths cut the aqueducts that fed them.Hemingway 2013. These baths remained mostly unused until the 6th and 7th century when Pilgrims being treated nearby in the Xenodochium of Santi Nereo ed Achilleo were buried at the location of the baths. The statue was displayed in the United States for the first time from June to July 2013 at the Metropolitan Museum of Art in New York City as part of the \\"Year of Italian Culture in the United States\\". Reception The literary and aesthetic reception of the statue continues to be of high regard for its aesthetic virtues. In 1991 Thom Jones wrote \\"The Pugilist at Rest\\", a short story which includes the aesthetic reflection upon the statue's rare quality as seen through the eyes of a worn and weary boxer contemplating its inspiration. He suggested that the sitter may be the famed Ancient boxer, Theogenes. During the time of its display in New York during the summer of 2013 (ended 20 July), New York magazine published on 15 July 2013 a full page dedication to the special qualities and attributes of the statue. Jerry Saltz, the author of this magazine article enumerated the six distinctive features of the statue as follows: (i) The Pose, distinct for its massiveness and \\"elemental\\" form, (ii) The Face, noted for the large brow and columnar neck, (iii) The Blood, noted by its inlaid copper upon the bronze statue itself, (iv) The Scarred Genitals, distinct for being infibulated for cultural and aesthetic purposes of ancient times, (v) The Hands, noted for being astounding yet gentle at the same time, and (vi) The Foresight, referring to the sculptor's strength of vision which resembles and conjures Goya's Giant as well as comparison with \\"Velazquez and Rembrandt\\", as Saltz completes his list. The Italian poet Gabriele Tinti has written essays and some poems on sculpture and presented a series of readings in front of the statue at the J. Paul Getty Museum with the actor Robert Davi and at the National Roman Museum with the actor Franco Nero.https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=379fr-ZlMQQ, National Roman Museum On August 2nd 2019 two time Oscar winner Kevin Spacey read Tinti’s poetry inspired by the statue at the National Roman Museum in Palazzo Massimo, the following day the official film of the reading was released on Tinti's YouTube channel.Kevin Spacey reads The Boxer, official video  See also  * Kynodesme  References   External links  *3D preview Category:4th-century BC sculptures Category:Ancient Greek metalwork Category:Boxing in art Category:Collections of the National Roman Museum Category:Hellenistic and Roman bronzes Category:Nude sculptures Category:Sculptures of sports ","title":"Boxer at Rest"},{"id":"3884800","text":"Sukkertoppen means \\"the Sugar Loaf\\" in Danish and Norwegian.

Early career Davies was born in Kidderminster, Worcestershire, but first played professional football for Cardiff City, after joining the club from non-league side Oldswinford Town. He made his debut for the Bluebirds on 16 February 1980 in a 1–0 defeat to Bristol Rovers but made just one further appearance or the club before leaving. He joined Trowbridge Town and Dutch club Heracles Almelo, scoring 7 times in 9 appearances for the club, before signing for his home town side Kidderminster Harriers for £1,500 in 1983. Later playing career A centre forward, Davies remained a free- scoring stalwart in various Harriers teams under long-serving Harriers' manager Graham Allner throughout the 1980s and into the 1990s, courtesy of Allner's free flowing 4-3-3 'total football' strategy. League sides made various approaches to sign the centre forward (including Cardiff City, Walsall and Wolves) but Davies remained with the Conference side though 656 games, scoring 307 goals, and becoming the Conference all-time top goal-scorer. With fellow strikers Kim Casey and Mick Tuohy, Davies had arguably his best spell in 1985–87 when the Harriers scored 99 goals in one season, with Davies scoring both goals in Kidderminster's 2–1 FA Trophy Final success against Burton Albion. 1986–87 then saw Davies joint-top scorer in the Conference with 26 goals. He finally left Harriers in 1999 to join Graham Allner as assistant at Worcester City.

Manatee Springs State Park is a Florida State Park located six miles west of Chiefland on SR 320, off US 19. Manatee Spring is a first magnitude spring that flows directly into the Suwannee River by way of a short run (though it is the longest spring run feeding the Suwannee River). Present also are swamps and hardwood wetlands along the Suwannee, along with many sinkhole ponds, including one with a cave 90 feet below the ground that connects to a popular divers' destination known as the catfish hotel. History Manatee Springs was visited in 1774 by William Bartram (1739–1823) and described in his book Travels through North & South Carolina, East & West Florida, the Cherokee Country, the Extensive Territories of the Muscogulges, or Creek Confederacy, and the Country of the Chactaws, Containing an Account of the Soil and Natural Productions of Those Regions, Together with Observations on the Manners of the Indians (1791); it was named by Bartram himself (\\"Manate Springs\\") after seeing a manatee carcass on the shoreline of the spring run. Biology Tree types in the park consist of cypress, sweetgum, maple and ash. Largemouth bass, speckled perch, catfish and bream and longnose gar are some of the fish in this part of the Suwannee. White- tailed deer and various small mammals and birds can also be seen in the park year-round. Manatees, for which the spring is named, are more commonly seen in fall and winter, as the constant 72 °F (23 °C) temperature acts as a warm haven for them. Manatees cannot survive long in cold water, so the spring provides a good place to calve and shelter if winter is particularly harsh. The spring also attracts large numbers of American black vultures, who winter here. The surprising number of birds makes for a somewhat Gothic spectacle, with moss-draped cypress trees surrounding the spring run filled with large, black birds. The vultures aren't particularly afraid of humans, but are not aggressive either. Recreational activities Swimming in the Spring. Activities include hiking, biking, kayaking, canoeing, as well as scuba diving, swimming, snorkeling and wildlife viewing. Some of the amenities are a floating dock, boardwalk, eight miles of wooded off-road trails, picnic Pavilions and full camping facilities. Swimming in the head spring and run is forbidden in winter, when manatees are more likely to be sheltering there. The so-called \\"catfish hotel\\" sinkhole and karst window near the main spring remains open year-round with access to these caverns. Swimming and snorkeling is not allowed in the catfish hotel, and is generally unpleasant due to the layer of duck weed covering the water. Sue sink is listed as an emergency exit only for cave divers in the system as ingress and egress is hazardous to the diver and causes soil erosion. Friedman sink is available as an entrance to certified cave divers, and is the furthest upstream entrance to the system. Certified Open Water divers can dive the head spring with lights, as well as the catfish hotel cavern without lights. Certified Cavern divers can dive the catfish hotel cavern with lights, but are not to explore beyond the daylight zone. Cavern divers should also exhibit caution when nearing the siphon side of the catfish hotel cavern, as the flow is immense. Certified and qualified cave divers are able to explore several miles of caverns which feed into the spring. Hours The park is open from 8:00 am till sundown year round.

JAD Records was the label which signed Bob Marley, Peter Tosh, Bunny Wailer and Rita Marley to an exclusive long-term contract as recording artists from 1968 to 1972. Other notable artists to sign with the label included Johnny Nash himself, Byron Lee , Neville Willoughby and later Jimmy Cliff. In 1996 JAD released a set of reworked songs from the early years of Bob Marley's career on an album called Soul Almighty - The Formative Years Vol 1. This was followed by Black Progress - The Formative Years Vol 2. Both albums used the vocal tracks from Bob's early material from the 1960s and added modern backing tracks including vocals from Rita Marley, Bob's son Ziggy and members of the Melody Makers. The response to these modern day remixes was so hostile that the label released the groundbreaking Complete Wailers series with the original tracks over the next two years. Despite their best efforts they could not license the tracks that were already under contract to Island (as part of the Songs Of Freedom box set). However, several years later they managed to license all the tracks and various sets containing them were reissued on the now JAD/Universal records in 2004.

The area was mainly built and developed in the 1970s and 1980s. Before the development corporation acquired Paston Ridings in 1974, by use of Section 22 of the Commons Act 1899, everyone had right of access to the common land comprising approximately 20 acres (8 ha). The parish church of All Saints', Paston, situated over the boundary in Walton ward, celebrated its 790th birthday in 2007. Demographically Paston has become increasingly diverse, including a large Gypsy community. At the 2001 census it had a population of 8,650. As Peterborough expands, the council has introduced a new statutory development plan.Peterborough Local Plan (First Replacement) Peterborough City Council, July 2005 Its aim is to accommodate an additional 22,000 homes, 18,000 jobs and over 40,000 people living in the city by 2020. A further 1,200 homes are to be built at Paston as part of this plan. Paston Ridings County Primary School has been in existence since 1994 and is an amalgamation of the former Infant and Junior Schools. The school has the capacity for 420 pupils with 14 classrooms, two halls, a computer suite and a separate library area. It has its own swimming pool and substantial grounds. Caverstede Early Years Centre is also located here.

History Its name stems from the medieval Bredene Dunc which translates as \\"wide mound\\" or \\"a dry spot in the marshes.\\" In the 19th century it was known for its beautiful Neo-Gothic church and the lavish mansion of the Earl de Buisseret. Both were destroyed by the Belgian army at the start of World War I because they obstructed the gunner's view from the local fortifications. From the 20th century on it was best known for its fortification at Fort Breendonk, built in 1909. It was judged that Antwerp, being continental Europe's second most important port, needed two circles of fortifications for its defence. Breendonk's fortification was part of the outer defensive ring. These fortifications were built on the same site previously occupied by Roman fortifications, this site having been selected because it was the only source of clean water in what until the 18th century was swampland. The modern fortifications fell to the Germans after only a seven-day siege. During World War II the fort was briefly used as the General Headquarters of King Leopold III, leading the Belgian armed forces. After his surrender to the Germans it was transformed into a concentration camp by the Nazis (primarily as a transit camp for transport to Auschwitz). It gained a grim reputation as a place of torture and interrogation of a wide variety of prisoners. Amongst those to be incarcerated (about 3500 in total, 1733 didn't survive the war) there were the linguist Herman Liebaers, fencer Jacques Ochs, Communist Party of Belgium politician Bert Van Hoorick and anti-Nazi fascist Paul Hoornaert. About 300 persons were killed in the camp, at least 98 people died from deprivation or torture. The fort is now home to the \\"Breendonk Fort National Memorial\\" which provides a historical record of the Nazi terror in Belgium. This museum is referenced for its historical significance in the W. G. Sebald novel Austerlitz. Breendonk is now most famous for the Duvel Moortgat Brewery where the Belgian beer Duvel (meaning \\"Devil\\" in the local South Brabantian dialect of Dutch), is brewed. The brewery reputedly uses the same spring once used by the Romans and the World War I fortifications. The village of Breendonk was merged in 1977 into the municipality of Puurs, while the fort and surrounding area east of the A12 road (leading from Antwerp to Brussels) became part of the municipality of Willebroek.

The temple is at an altitude of about 900m in north Wayanad in a valley surrounded by mountains and beautiful forests. It is 32 km away from Manathavady.  History  No proper records of the exact dates of establishment of temple exist, though it is beyond dispute, that Thirunelli was once an important town and pilgrim center in the middle of an inaccessible jungle valley surrounded by mountains on four sides . There exists documentary proof that Thirunelli at the time of Chera king Bhaskara Ravi Varma I (962–1019 CE) was an important town and pilgrim center in South India. In the dense jungles surrounding temple, the ruins of two ancient villages can be found. Noted historian V. R. Parameswaran Pillai in his book Thirunelli Documents states that this temple was once an integral part of the early recorded history of Kerala. = Mention in Puranas and folklore = The name Thirunelli derives from the nelli, the Tamil/Malayalam word for Indian gooseberry of the Amla tree. Veda vyasa wrote the 18 existing Puranas. The Matsya Purana, Skanda Purana, Narasimha Purana, Padma Purana, and many other Puranas and Hindu texts mention the beautiful Vishnu temple as being built by Lord Brahma, located in the picturesque Sahya valley, deep in the middle of forest of unmatchable beauty, and in these texts, it is referred to as \\"Sahyamalaka Kshetra.\\"http://www.kamakotimandali.com/misc/thirunelli.html According to tradition, Lord Brahma was traveling round the Universe on his hamsa, when he became attracted by the beauty of the area now known as Brahmagiri Hill. Descending on that spot, Brahma noticed an idol, set in an Amla tree. Brahma recognized the idol as Lord Vishnu Himself and the place as Vaikuntha (Vishnuloka) itself.http://www.eastrovedica.net/?p=227 With the help of the Devas, Brahma installed the idol and called it Sahyamalak Kshetra. At Brahma’s request Vishnu promised that the waters of the area would wash away all sins. (Thus, the spring and river near the temple is called Papanasini: \\"washes away all sins\\"). Even today the head priest of the temple leaves a portion of the worship materials in the belief that Lord Brahma Himself will come and perform pooja rites deep in the holy hours of morning. The famous incarnation of Lord Vishnu Parasurama is reputed to have visited Thirunelli and performed last rites of his father sage Jamadagni. He also took immersion in the Papanasini to wipe away sins committed in killing Kshatriyas.  Relation with other temples and legends  Kottiyoor Temple and Trisillery temple are inextricably linked with legends and folklore to Thirunelli temple. There exists an old route which traverses Narinirangi Mala to connect with Trissilery Maha Deva Lord Siva temple. In earlier days, all devotees who visited Trissilery used to undertake the arduous crossing of Narinirangi mala to pay respect to Lord Vishnu and Brahma at Thirunelli. The journey was fraught with danger and might have been comparable to hardships of early Sabarimala pilgrimages.  Surroundings  =Papanasini stream= Emanating from the heart of Brahmagiri forest flowing through roots, leaves and flowers of ancient trees and medicinal herbs, Papanasini is a holy mountain stream accessible around 1 km northwest of the temple premises. Pilgrims bathe here as they consider its waters to be sacred with powers to absolve one's sins. Further, the temple offers services to immerse cremation ashes in the sacred mountain stream to be thus carried to Kaveri River and from there to the ocean. This is a part of the last rites.Thirunelli Maha Vishnu Temple: Papanasini, Kerala =Panchatheertham= Panchatheertham - the holy temple pond. Panchatheertham is the holy temple pond. One notable feature of the temple is the lack of a temple well. Hence water is transported from a perennial mountain stream deep in the valley by impressive stone aqueducts right into the priests' room. Thirunelli is famous as the destination to perform last rites of the deceased at the rock close to Papa nasini stream. Renovation Parts of the temple including sanctum sanctorum is being renovated. Renovation activities can be seen on one side of the temple where sculpted stones and beautiful wood carvings are under preparation. Access The temple lies at an altitude of 3000 feet and can be reached by driving through three wild life sanctuaries. Thirunelli Temple can be accessed from Mananthavady or Kalpetta. The Periya ghat road connects Mananthavady to Kannur and Thalassery. The Thamarassery mountain road connects Calicut with Kalpetta. The Kuttiady mountain road connects Vatakara with Kalpetta and Mananthavady. The Palchuram mountain road connects Kannur and Iritty with Mananthavady.

Priced at US$249, it weighs 600 grams (22 ounces) and can be powered by four AA batteries or an AC adapter. It was intended as a portable business computer, and uses TI's TMS70C20 CPU, an 8-bit microprocessor that runs at 2.5 MHz. The CC-40 has 6 kilobytes of on board Random Access Memory (expandable to 18 KB), 34 KB of Read Only Memory, and a 31-character LCD display. It is capable of operating for 200 hours off one set of batteries, and memory is not erased by powering the unit off, so an unpowered unit can retain data for several months. The CC-40 has a single Hexbus port for connecting peripherals. The following Hexbus peripherals were released: 80 column printer, printer/plotter, RS232, and modem. A digital \\"wafertape\\" unit (a licensed version of the Exatron Stringy Floppy) depicted on the computer's box was only released as a prototype, reportedly because it proved too unreliable. The inability to store data permanently hurt the CC-40's sales. Software was only available on cartridge or by typing programs into its built- in BASIC interpreter. The BASIC interpreter is similar but not identical to the TI-99/4A. Reception BYTE heavily criticized the CC-40; \\"there's no clock. No file system. Only one BASIC program at a time can reside in memory, and the user can only work with about 5200 bytes of that. And the keyboard is vile\\". It also noted the lack of any external storage because the TI wafertape drive was not available, and the complete lack of software. The review suggested that the computer should be considered a \\"dandy scientific calculator\\" since good programmable calculators cost about the same as the CC-40's $250 price, but that otherwise \\"virtually all of its competition vastly outstrips it in power and features\\", including the $99 TI-99/4A. In a review for Creative Computing, Joe Devlin wrote, \\"The permanent memory and powerful Basic exceed the capabilities found in most hand-held computers.\\" He recommended it as a convenient tool for learning BASIC or for someone who frequently does calculations with formulas. In 1983, MicroKids magazine included the CC-40 on a list of \\"Top 10 Great Gift Ideas.\\" Legacy Compact Computer 70 mock-up The Hex-Bus interface was also available for the TI-99/4A as an unreleased prototype expansion peripheral. It was built into the prototypes of the cancelled TI-99/2 and TI-99/8 computers. An improved model, the CC-40 Plus, was in the final stages of development and included a cassette port. The project was canceled when Texas Instruments discontinued the 99/4A and left the home computer field. Also in development was the Compact Computer 70. The CC-70 was to have four cartridge ports, more RAM, and an 8 x 80 display with graphics capability. Some of the work completed on the CC-70 was later revived in the TI-74 Basicalc.

Career Halper attended Northeastern University, where she received B.A., M.A., and M.Ed. degrees. In 1968 she became the first female announcer at Northeastern's campus radio station, WNEU (now WRBB). Halper went on to a career that spanned 12 years as a radio broadcaster, music director, and music producer in Cleveland, New York City, Washington, D.C., and Boston. In 1980, Halper became a radio consultant for college and commercial radio stations in the United States, eastern Canada and Puerto Rico. In the late 1980s, Halper began teaching college courses about broadcasting, media criticism, and media history. She taught part-time at Emerson College, in the journalism department and the Institute of Liberal Arts until the summer of 2008, when she accepted a position as assistant professor of communication at Lesley University in Cambridge, Massachusetts. In 1987–88, Halper taught courses at Franklin Pierce University in Rindge, New Hampshire on radio programming. She has also taught at the University of Massachusetts Amherst and the University of Massachusetts Boston. In May 2011, she earned a Ph.D. in communication from UMass Amherst. A media and social historian, Halper has written essays for encyclopedias and magazines. In 2008, she contributed a chapter in Michael C.

She has also authored a number of books, including Icons of Talk: The Media Mouths that Changed America, a history of talk shows. Halper has also researched and written about baseball history for the Society for American Baseball Research Baseball Research Journal, documenting radio broadcasting's impact on the game, and highlighting obscure, overlooked or neglected aspects of the sport. Halper also is a guest speaker specializing in the topic of the history of broadcasting, often bringing with her a collection of rare memorabilia. She has been a guest expert on NPR, PBS, the History Channel, and on local television stations WCVB-TV and NECN, commenting on media history.For example: Her work has focused on women and minorities in media history, talk radio, and people whose contributions to broadcasting have been overlooked or forgotten, such as broadcast pioneers like John Shepard III, Eunice Randall, and Big Brother Bob Emery. Halper was cited in a 2010 Los Angeles Times profile on WorldNetDaily founder Joseph Farah as an example of support from \\"unexpected corners\\" of society. Although Halper admits that she wonders \\"how much of what's in WorldNetDaily is just 'Let's be provocative'\\", she praised Farah's \\"interesting and honest writing\\" and says she makes WND \\"required reading\\" for her Lesley University students.  Rush  Halper is credited with discovering the rock band Rush while working as the Music Director at radio station WMMS in Cleveland in 1974. After a Canadian record producer gave her the then- unknown band's album, she played a track called “Working Man” on the air. Listeners started requesting more Rush tracks. Soon, other radio stations began including Rush songs in their playlists, and by late summer of 1974, the band got a U.S. recording contract.

The renowned Heinrich-Heine-University is located in Bilk.  History  Old Saint Martin Church Observatory (Bilker Sternwarte) The first documentary mention of Bilk is in the year 799. The Old Church is older and seems to be from about 700 A.D., given by Saint Suitbert, but was destroyed by fire about 900, and is mentioned in 1019 for the first time. During the following centuries, the church was reconstructed frequently, especially in the 12th century and the 17th century. Until the year 1206 the fishing settlement dusseldorp, located to the North of Bilk, belonged to the Bilk parish. After August 14 of 1288 (the Battle of Worringen) Düsseldorf got City Rights, the Old Bilk Church became a city church. In 1380 the County of Berg became the Duchy of Berg, Düsseldorf the capital of a duchy. In 1384 the village of Bilk (south of the Old Bilk Church, which belonged to Düsseldorf from beginning) became part of the city of Düsseldorf. Starting in 1852 in the South of Düsseldorf there was a growth of factories during the Industrial Revolution. Düsseldorf grew to the south and the traditionally industrial centres of the city are still there today. In 1893 the Hammer Eisenbahnbrücke - a railway bridge across the river Rhine - was finished. Bilk got its own railway station, which today is only a station for regional trains. The Bilk Observatory was founded in 1843 and destroyed by bombing in 1943. In 1852 24 asteroids were found there, called the 24 Düsseldorf planets. The New Harbour of Düsseldorf was built between 1890 and 1896, but after a steel factory closed its production, the port losts its importance. In 1990 a great part of it was closed and filled in. The media industry settled on this land and a cultural centre grew. In 1999 the Gehry buildings completed the new assemble.  Infrastructure  Düsseldorf-Bilk station is now served only by the Rhine-Ruhr S-Bahn (slow regional trains) and is connected by the lines S 8, S 11 and S 28 to Neuss, Mönchengladbach, Kaarst, Wuppertal, Hagen, Erkrath, Mettmann, Dormagen, Cologne and other parts of Düsseldorf (Central station, Düsseldorf-Gerresheim,...). Tram lines connect Bilk with the central district of Düsseldorf and a lot of other districts, especially with the south of the city, Neuss, Ratingen, and the University. Also, bus lines connect Bilk with other parts of the city and the neighboring towns.

This species grows to 16 inches. It is closely related to the popular plecostomus catfish kept in many aquaria as an algae eater, but is immediately distinguished by being dark grey to black and having bright, turquoise coloured eyes. Like other species of the Panaque genus, P. cochliodon feeds primarily on submerged wood . Blue-eyed plecs grow to about 30 cm in length, and like other Panaque spp., they are clumsy swimmers adapted to staying close the substrate, in particular using the sucker-like mouth to hold on to submerged rocks and wood. Blue-eye plecs as aquarium fish Blue-eyed plecs have been kept as aquarium fish, and were fairly popular during the 1980s and early 1990s. However, they are now very rarely traded because wild fish can only be obtained from rivers in Colombia considered to be outside the control of the Colombian government. As with other Panaque, these fish are generally hardy and easy to keep, although parasitic, Rickettsia-like bacteria can be a problem , particularly when newly imported. These fish enjoy a mixed diet of algae, raw vegetables such as courgette, and wood, much like the more widely kept Panaque nigrolineatus.

He was last in charge as head coach of Torino. Career A former footballer who played for Livorno, Lazio, Brindisi, Arezzo, Salernitana and Bari, Papadopulo started his coaching career in 1984 at Cecina, a minor amateur team of Tuscany. Then, after two years as assistant coach for Casertana, he debuted at the professional level in 1987 for Sorrento. In 1989, he coached of Licata, a small Sicilian Serie B team at the time. After two other coaching experiences for Monopoli and Perugia, Papadopulo in 1993 drove Acireale to a surprising promotion to Serie B. He then coached Avellino, Livorno, and led Fidelis Andria to another Serie B promotion. But, after two other short times with Lucchese and Crotone, Papadopulo finally had his luckiest success for A.C. Siena (2001–2004), leading the team from the relegation zone in Serie B to its first Serie A spot ever, and even maintaining the top division the next year. Papadopulo was nicknamed il Papa (The Pope) by Siena fans during his period in the team, that he led from Serie B to survival in the Italian top division. During the 2004–2005 season, Papadopulo was appointed as new coach of Lazio, replacing Domenico Caso; however, he left his managing position at the end of the season. On 29 January 2006, Papadopulo has been called back to Sicily in order to replace Luigi Delneri at the helm of U.S. Città di Palermo, and debuted with a surprising 3–0 win against AC Milan for a match of Italian Cup. After a series of impressive results which led Palermo off the lower places in the standings, and despite a one-year renewal signed before the end of the season, Papadopulo was dismissed from the rosanero, in order to be replaced by Francesco Guidolin. On 28 December 2006 he became the new manager of Serie B club Lecce. In his second season with the giallorossi, Papadopulo obtained a third place in the Serie B final table, and then managed to defeat Pisa and AlbinoLeffe in the promotion playoffs, thus securing promotion to the top flight. Despite this, he left the club weeks later, after failing to reach an agreement with the club, who eventually decided to appoint Mario Beretta at his place. On 14 April 2009 was appointed new head coach of Bologna, after Siniša Mihajlović's dismissal.Official: Bologna Sack Sinisa Mihajlovic, Appoint Giuseppe Papadopulo On 20 October 2009 Papadopulo was fired as head coach of Bologna replaced by Franco Colomba.Bologna, via Papadopulo Al suo posto c'è Colomba On 9 March 2011 he was named new head coach of Serie B fallen giants Torino in place of Franco Lerda.

It was published in 1905. The book deals with questions in the philosophy of science and adds detail to the topics addressed by Poincaré's previous book, Science and Hypothesis (1902). Intuition and logic The first part of the book deals exclusively with the mathematical sciences, and particularly, the relationship between intuition and logic in mathematics. It first examines which parts of science correspond to each of these two categories of scientific thought, and outlines a few principles: * What we define as intuition changes with the course of time (Classical philosophers were seen as logicians in their time, but today we might think of them as using intuition) - it is therefore the ideas that change, in the evolution of scientific thought; * This evolution began with the arithmetization of analysis, and ended with the revival of intuitive ideas in an axiomatic system, by the first (true) logicians. This historic intuition is therefore mathematical intuition. For Poincaré, it is a result of the principle of least effort, that is, of a link to scientific convention based on experimentation. Convention, thus given a context, permits one to consider different theories of the same problem, and subsequently make a choice based on the degree of simplicity and usefulness of explanations advanced by each of these theories (see also Occam's razor). The example chosen by Poincaré is that of three-dimensional space. He shows how the representation of this space is only one possibility, chosen for its usefulness among many models that the mind could create. His demonstration rests on the theory of The Mathematical Continuum (1893), one of Poincaré's earlier publications. Finally, Poincaré advances the idea of a fundamental relationship between the sciences of geometry and analysis. According to him, intuition has two major roles: to permit one to choose which route to follow in search of scientific truth, and to allow one to comprehend logical developments: Moreover, this relation seems to him inseparable from scientific advancement, which he presents as an enlargement of the framework of science - new theories incorporating previous ones, even while breaking old patterns of thought. Mathematical physics In the second part of his book, Poincaré studies the links between physics and mathematics. His approach, at once historical and technical, illustrates the preceding general ideas. Even though he was rarely an experimenter, Poincaré recognizes and defends the importance of experimentation, which must remain a pillar of the scientific method. According to him, it is not necessary that mathematics incorporate physics into itself, but must develop as an asset unto itself. This asset would be above all a tool: in the words of Poincaré, mathematics is \\"the only language in which [physicists] could speak\\" to understand each other and to make themselves heard. This language of numbers seems elsewhere to reveal a unity hidden in the natural world, when there may well be only one part of mathematics that applies to theoretical physics. The primary objective of mathematical physics is not invention or discovery, but reformulation. It is an activity of synthesis, which permits one to assure the coherence of theories current at a given time. Poincaré recognized that it is impossible to systematize all of physics of a specific time period into one axiomatic theory. His ideas of a three dimensional space are given significance in this context. Poincaré states that mathematics (analysis) and physics are in the same spirit, that the two disciplines share a common aesthetic goal and that both can liberate humanity from its simple state. In a more pragmatic way, the interdependence of physics and mathematics is similar to his proposed relationship between intuition and analysis. The language of mathematics not only permits one to express scientific advancements, but also to take a step back to comprehend the broader world of nature. Mathematics demonstrates the extent of the specific and limited discoveries made by physicists. On the other hand, physics has a key role for the mathematician - a creative role since it presents atypical problems ingrained in reality. In addition, physics offers solutions and reasoning - thus the development of infinitesimal calculus by Isaac Newton within the framework of Newtonian mechanics. Mathematical physics finds its scientific origins in the study of celestial mechanics. Initially, it was a consolidation of several fields of physics that dominated the 18th century and which had allowed advancements in both the theoretical and experimental fields. However, in conjunction with the development of thermodynamics (at the time disputed), physicists began developing an energy-based physics. In both its mathematics and its fundamental ideas, this new physics seemed to contradict the Newtonian concept of particle interactions. Poincaré terms this the first crisis of mathematical physics. =Second crisis= Throughout the 19th century, important discoveries were being made in laboratories and elsewhere. Many of these discoveries gave substance to important theories. Other discoveries could not be explained satisfactorily - either they had only been occasionally observed, or they were inconsistent with the new and emerging theories. At the beginning of the 20th century, the unifying principles were thrown into question. Poincaré explains some of the most important principles and their difficulties: * The principle of conservation of energy (which he called Mayer's principle) - the discovery of radium and radioactivity posed the problem of the continuous (and seemingly inexhaustible) energy emission of radioactive substances. * The principle of entropy (which he called Carnot's principle) - Brownian motion seemed to be in opposition to the second law of thermodynamics. * Newton's Third Law (which he called Newton's principle) — This law seemed to conflict with the laws of electrodynamics proposed by Maxwell, and with the ether theory he had proposed to explain them. * The principle of conservation of mass (which he called Lavoisier's principle) — the consideration of movements at a speed close to that of light posed a problem for this principle; this is again an electrodynamic problem : the mass of a body in such a state of motion is not constant. * the principle of relativity . * Finally, he added the principle of least action. At the beginning of the twentieth century, the majority of scientists spoke of Poincaré's \\"diagnosis\\" concerning the crisis of the physical principles. In fact, it was difficult to do otherwise: they had discovered experimental facts which the principles could not account for, and which they evidently could not ignore. Poincaré himself remained relatively optimistic regarding the evolution of physics with respect to these severe experimental difficulties. He had little confidence in the nature of principles: they were constructed by physicists because they accommodate and take into account a large number of laws. Their objective value consists in forming a scientific convention, in other words in providing a firm foundation to the basis on which truth and falsehood (in the scientific meaning of the words) are separated. But if these principles are conventions, they are not therefore totally dissociated from experimental fact. On the contrary, if the principles can no longer sustain laws adequately, in accordance with experimental observation, they lose their utility and are rejected, without even having been contradicted. The failure of the laws entails the failure of the principles, because they must account for the results of experiment. To abolish these principles, products of the scientific thought of several centuries, without finding a new explanation that encompasses them (in the same manner that the \\"Physics of principles\\" encompasses the \\"Physics of central forces\\"), is to claim that all of past physics has no intellectual value. Consequently, Poincaré had great confidence that the principles were salvageable. He said that it was the responsibility of mathematical physics to reconstitute those principles, or to find a replacement for them (the greater goal being to return the field to unity), given that it had played the main role in questioning them only after consolidating them to begin with. Moreover, it was the value of mathematical physics (in terms of the scientific method) which itself saw criticism, due to the implosion of certain theories. Two physics thus existed at the same time: the physics of Galileo and Newton, and the physics of Maxwell; but neither one was able to explain all the experimental observations that technical advances had produced. =Electrodynamics of moving bodies= The array of problems encountered concentrated on the electrodynamics of moving bodies. Poincaré swiftly proposed the idea that it is the ether modifying itself, and not the bodies acquiring mass, which came to contradict the older theories (based on a perfectly immovable ether). Overall, Poincaré shed light on the Zeeman effect, caused by discontinuous emissions of electrons. The problem of discontinuous matter forced the formulation of a minimally-destabilizing model of the atom. In 1913, Niels Bohr presented his atomic model which was based on the concept of electron orbits, and which explained spectroscopy as well as the stability of the atom. But, in 1905, the problem with all attempts to define the behavior of the microscopic world was that no one then knew if they needed to consider a similar model to the one known for the macroscopic objects (the model of classical mechanics), or if they should try to develop an entirely new model to give account of new facts. The latter idea, which was followed with the quantum theory, also implied definitively abandoning the unity already found in prior theories of mechanics. =Future of mathematical physics= Poincaré argued that the advancement of the physical sciences would have to consider a new kind of determinism, giving a new place to chance. And in effect, the history of twentieth century physics is marked by a paradigm where probability reigns. In The Value of Science, Poincaré writes and repeats his enthusiasm for two lines of research : statistical laws (taking the place of differential laws), and relativistic mechanics (taking the place of Newtonian mechanics). Nevertheless, he did not take into account the ideas of Planck. This latter had in 1900 published the spectral laws governing blackbody radiation, which were the foundation of quantum mechanics. In 1905, the same year as the publication of The Value of Science, Albert Einstein published a decisive article on the photoelectric effect, which he based on the work of Planck. Despite the doubts of Poincaré, which were no doubt related to his vision of physics as an approximation of reality (in contrast to the exactness of mathematics), the probabilistic rules of quantum mechanics were clearly the response to the second crisis of mathematical physics, at the end of the nineteenth century. (One can point out that in 1902, Poincaré envisaged a relativistic physics which closely matched, in its theoretical development, the one developed and propounded by Einstein several years later.) Objective value of science \\"What is the purpose of science?\\" is the question repeatedly asked in Poincaré's book. To this teleological problem, Poincaré responds by taking the opposite position from that of Édouard Le Roy, philosopher and mathematician, who argued in a 1905 article (Sur la logique de l'invention, \\"On the logic of invention\\") that science is intrinsically anti-intellectual (in the sense of Henri Bergson) and nominalistic. In contrast to Le Roy, Poincaré follows the thought of Pierre Duhem. He explains that the notion that science is anti-intellectual is self- contradictory, and that the accusation of nominalism can be strongly criticized, because it rests on confusions of thoughts and definitions. He defends the idea of conventional principles, and the idea that scientific activity is not merely a set of conventions arranged arbitrarily around the raw observations of experiment. He wishes rather to demonstrate that objectivity in science comes precisely from the fact that the scientist does no more than translate raw facts into a particular language: \\"(...) tout ce que crée le savant dans un fait, c'est le langage dans lequel il l'énonce\\". The only contribution of science would be the development of a more and more mathematized language, a coherent language because it offers predictions which are useful – but not certain, as they remain forever subject to comparisons with real observations, and are always fallible.  Other contributions  Prof Richard Feynman contributed in a 1955 paper to the question of What is the Value of Science. References  Further reading * Mind, New Series, Vol. 2, No. 6.

The motherhouse is located at Mt. St. Vincent in the Riverdale section of the Bronx. Saint Elizabeth Ann Seton (1774 - 1821) History Saint Elizabeth Seton founded the Sisters of Charity in Emmitsburg, Maryland, in 1809, modeling her foundation on the Daughters of Charity founded in France by Saint Vincent de Paul and Saint Louise de Marillac in the 17th century. The Sisters followed the Vincentian practice of taking temporary religious vows of poverty, chastity, and obedience, renewing these annually (in contrast to most orders of religious women, who at some point take permanent or \\"perpetual\\" vows). This practice lasted until 1938, when the congregation adopted the more standard practice of professing lifetime vows. St. Patrick's Convent and Girls' School In 1814, Mother Seton sent three sisters to care for orphans after receiving a request from clergy in Philadelphia. In 1817, three Sisters were sent to New York City (which was Seton's hometown) to establish an orphanage, at the corner of Prince and Mott Streets. The Sisters quickly took on the job of establishing Catholic orphanages in a city overrun with abandoned, orphaned or neglected children. Mother Seton had established one of the first Catholic elementary schools in Emmitsburg. With this background, the Sisters also began to establish or staff existing parish schools, particularly in poor and immigrant neighborhoods, and to set up hospitals. Some of the earliest, sustained social service institutions and health care facilities in New York City were started by the sisters. The motherhouse at Emmitsburg negotiated for affiliation with the Daughters of Charity in France. In consequence there developed a tendency to dispense with certain customs observed at Emmitsburg because these changes were required by the French superiors; for example, the sisters in charge of boys' asylums were everywhere to be withdrawn. The measure threatened at that period the very existence of the New York orphanage. The allegiance of the sisters to local Catholics in New York came in conflict with their obedience to their superiors in Emmitsburg, eventually leading to the establishment of a separate order recognized as the Sisters of Charity of New York (SCNY). Forrest's Font Hill by the Hudson River In 1846, the Sisters in New York incorporated as a separate entity from the Sisters of Charity still based in Maryland. Mother Elizabeth Boyle was the first Mother Superior, succeeded by Mother Jerome Ely. They became the Sisters of Charity of New York. This was not unusual, in that several other groups of Sisters founded by Seton established themselves as independent diocesan entities once their communities reached maturity. The novitiate of the New York community was opened at St. James's Academy, 35 East Broadway, and later moved to the new motherhouse on an estate purchased at Mcgown's Pass, situated within the limits of the present Central Park. Here, in 1847, the Academy of Mount Saint Vincent had its foundation. In the late 1850s the sisters bought the Edwin Forrest estate called Font Hill and the Motherhouse and academy relocated to the Riverdale section of the Bronx. In 1849 four sisters were sent from Mount Saint Vincent to Halifax, Nova Scotia. The Sisters of Charity of Halifax became an independent congregation in 1856.\\"Sisters of Charity of St. Vincent De Paul\\", The Catholic Church in the United States of America, Catholic Editing Company, 1914, p. 49 In 1890 the Sisters of Saint Martha of Antigonish evolved from the Halifax congregation as an order initially devoted to housekeeping and nursing duties at St. Francis University. In 1856, under Mother Mary Xavier Mehegan, a local community was formed of the sisters then labouring in the Diocese of Newark. Sister Irene and children at New York Foundling, 1888 As immigrants arrived in poverty during the 19th century, the sisters became known for accepting newborns at the doorsteps of the convent. The Sisters in New York established The New York Foundling in 1869, an orphanage for abandoned children but also a place for unmarried mothers to receive care themselves and offer their children for adoption. (New York immigrant communities were plagued by prostitution rings that preyed on young women, and out-of-wedlock pregnancies were a severe problem in these communities.) New York Foundling continues its work today and is noted for its work with babies and young children infected with HIV, and also with severely handicapped children. In 1855, Archbishop John Hughes' sister, Mary Angela Hughes became Superior of the Sisters in New York. It was during Mother Angela's tenure that the Sisters of Charity of Newark branched off as a separate congregation. The cholera epidemic of 1849 impelled the Sisters to open St. Vincent's Hospital in Manhattan (closed 2010), the first Catholic hospital in New York City.\\"Sisters of Charity of New York\\", United Hospital Fund St. Vincent's Hospital became the centerpiece of an extensive health care system under the Sisters' care that included St. Vincent's Hospital in Westchester (a psychiatric hospital) as well as two hospitals on Staten Island: St. Vincent's Hospital (closed 2006) and Bayley Seton Hospital, in addition to a network of nursing homes and other institutions. In 1862 the sisters nursed Civil War wounded in St. Joseph's Military Hospital, former site of Mt. St. Vincent in Central Park. The hospital closed in 1865. The Sisters were also the key congregation in the establishment of New York's parochial school system, staffing more schools than any other single order of women. In addition to parish schools (which, in New York, typically carry children through grade 8), the sisters ran a number of high schools themselves or provided staff for high schools run by others, and they established the College of Mount Saint Vincent, which also serves as their motherhouse. They also founded St. Joseph by-the-Sea High School on Staten Island. Beginning as a summer retreat for orphans from the Foundling Hospital and as a place for the sisters to obtain degrees under the auspices of Mount St. Vincent, it was turned into an all-girls Catholic high school in 1963. Now co-ed, it is still staffed by a number of Sisters of Charity. In 1958 the Congregation opened the Convent of Mary the Queen in Yonkers as a residence for Senior Sisters. Today, the Sisters of Charity of New York is a constituent community of the Federation of Sisters of Charity in the Vincentian-Setonian Tradition, an umbrella group that brings together the various congregations that trace their roots back to Saint Elizabeth Seton, and ultimately to Saint Vincent de Paul. Mission The website of the Sisters of Charity of New York states the congregation's mission as follows: > The Mission of the Sisters of Charity is to share in the ongoing mission of > Jesus by responding to the signs of the times in the spirit of St. Vincent > de Paul and St. Elizabeth Ann Seton, by revealing the Father’s love in our > lives and in our varied ministries with and for all in need, especially > those living in poverty. Ministry The congregation's traditional ministries have been in education, healthcare, and child care. However, members have expanded their ministries to include parish ministries; spiritual direction and retreat opportunities; and homeless, new immigrant, and women's centers. The sisters are active in ecological concerns, and sponsor a number of affordable housing facilities for those in need.\\"Sisters of Charity of New York, Vincentian Online Library Close Up & Vision Close Up was the inaugural magazine of the Sisters of Charity of New York. Close Up has since ceased operation. But the Sisters have launched Vision magazine. Vision is quarterly release with Winter, Spring, Summer, and Fall issues. Vision magazine has interviews, features, and stories concerning the Sisters of Charity of New York. The writing team of Vision consists of Sisters, associates, and those that work with the Sisters of Charity of New York. In February 2018, the Sisters of Charity of New York celebrated thirty years of publication. The magazine currently available in print and on the Sisters of Charity of the New York's website in digital form.
