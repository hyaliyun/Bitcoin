Background and History In 1959 the new leader of the Iraqi republic, Brigadier General Abd al-Karim Qasim commissioned a monument that would be a celebration of Iraq's declaration of independence. It was to be situated in the heart of Baghdad's central business district, overlooking Liberation Square and Jamhouriyya Bridge. He approached the architect Rifat Chadirji, one of Iraqi's leading architects. He developed an idea with Jewad Selim, who was well-known for works that integrated Iraq's ancient history with contemporary themes and techniques. The Brigadier General wanted it to be a symbol of a new nation state, however, Jewad Selim chose to design a monument symbolising the people's strife against tyranny and paid homage to Iraq's deep art history by including Abassid and Babylonian wall- reliefs, producing a sculpture that was both \\"strikingly modern\\" yet also referenced tradition.Al-Khalil, S. and Makiya, K., The Monument: Art, Vulgarity, and Responsibility in Iraq, University of California Press, 1991, p. 83 Saleem laboured on the project under difficult conditions, resisting all attempts by Qasim to have his image incorporated into the monument.Al-Khalil, S. and Makiya, K., The Monument: Art, Vulgarity, and Responsibility in Iraq, University of California Press, 1991, p. 82 Initially, Saleem had wanted the sculpture to be at ground level, but the project architect, Rifa'at Chadirchi, insisted that it be elevated so that it would look more 'monumental'. As a result, the completed work faces the busy traffic rather than people walking in the adjacent gardens.Greenberg, N., \\"Political Modernism, JabrƒÅ, and the Baghdad Modern Art Group,\\" CLCWeb: Comparative Literature and Culture, Vol. 12, No. 2, 2010, Online: https://docs.lib.purdue.edu/cgi/viewcontent.cgi?article=1603&context;=clcweb, DOI: 10.7771/1481-4374.160; Floyd, T., \\"Mohammed Ghani Hikmat,\\" [Biographical Notes] in: Mathaf Encyclopedia of Modern Art and the Islamic World, Online: http://www.encyclopedia.mathaf.org.qa/en/bios/Pages/Mohammed-Ghani-Hikmat.aspx Although the monument was Saleem's design, he did not see the project through to completion.

She was also known as Belle Mackenzie. She was notable for starring in a three-year, cross-country touring production of A Contented Woman and for creating the role of Cousin Hebe in H.M.S. Pinafore.  Early years  Archer was born in Easton, Pennsylvania, the daughter of J.L. Mingle, a businessman with Western Union. She grew up in Easton and was educated there. As a youngster, Archer ran away from the Philadelphia Normal School with a friend with the goal of joining a theatrical troupe. She was stopped in Baltimore, however, and taken back to her home.  Career  Before she was 16 years old, Archer debuted on stage in Baltimore under theater manager John T. Ford. In 1879, billed as Belle Mackenzie, \\"she had created the role of Cousin Hebe\\" when the comic opera H.M.S. Pinafore premiered in Philadelphia. As early as 1881, she was performing in New York City in the play Won at Last. In 1882, she was signed to a three-year contract with Madison Square Theatre, with her initial role that of heading the production of Hazel Kirke. Archer became the leading lady for actor Charles H. Hoyt, succeeding his wife, Caroline Miskel Hoyt. She also starred in A Contented Woman, touring the United States for three years in that production, and acted for about two years each with companies headed by E.H. Sothern and Alexander Salvini. An article in the March 1899 issue of Munsey's Magazine credited Archer with being the first female press agent. \\"Besides being a clever actress,\\" it said, Miss Archer has the distinction of having opened a new field for woman's work. This was in 1893, when she went in advance of Carrie Turner as press agent.\\" In 1888, Archer received $1,200 per year from a New York photographer for the right to print photographs of her. Personal life On September 19, 1880, she married actor H.R. Archer in Norfolk, Virginia. They met when he joined a theatrical company in which she was acting, and they married soon afterward. Death On September 19, 1900, Archer died in the Warren, Pennsylvania, emergency hospital following a blood clot on her brain. She was buried in the family plot in Easton Cemetery, Easton, Pennsylvania. The cemetery contains a six-foot-tall stone with \\"a coin-shaped profile\\" of Archer.

She was the illegitimate daughter of Abigail Maheha and King Kamehameha V, who reigned from 1863 to 1872, and was born during a liaison between the two when they were students at the Chiefs' Children's School (later renamed the Royal School), a boarding school run by American missionaries for students of Hawaiian royal descent. Keanolani was raised by her father's half-sister Ke ªelik≈çlani. Her illegitimate birth and unacknowledged parentage prevented her from succeeding to the Hawaiian throne when her father died without naming an heir, thus ending the reign of the House of Kamehameha. In 1873, she became a mistress of her uncle by marriage William Hoapili Ka ªauwai. In 1874, she became a supporter of the newly elected House of KalƒÅkaua. She married and left descendants. Her name is also often spelled as Keano or Keanu. In one source, she is named as Keauo ªokalau.  Birth and parentage  Keanolani was born July 7, 1847, on the island of Kaua ªi. Her birth occurred five months after her mother, thirteen-year-old Abigail Maheha, had an arranged marriage to a commoner named Keaupuni, an expelled student from Lahainaluna Seminary and servant of her hƒÅnai (informally adopted) mother, Governess Kekau ª≈çnohi of Kaua ªi. Through Maheha, Keanolani was the granddaughter of High Chief Namaile and High Chiefess Kuini Liliha, who was the Royal Governor of O ªahu from 1829 to 1831 and a political adversary of Queen Ka ªahumanu, the Kuhina Nui (premier) during the reigns of Kamehameha II and Kamehameha III. Maheha was a former student at the Chiefs' Children's School, later renamed the Royal School, a boarding school run by American missionaries Amos Starr Cooke and his wife Juliette Montague Cooke for students of Hawaiian royal descent. She was declared eligible for the throne of the Kingdom of Hawaii by King Kamehameha III. However, the thirteen- year-old Maheha had left the school at the insistence of her teachers, and was married off to Keaupuni to cover an unexpected pregnancy. Keaupuni was not the biological father of the baby, as was later attested by Mele, a witness in the 1855 divorce suit between him and Maheha. Her father was not officially identified. However, during and after her lifetime, speculation has focused on two princes of the Kamehameha dynasty: the seventeen-year-old Moses Kek≈´ƒÅiwa, who was the eldest boy at the Royal School, or his sixteen-year-old brother Lot KapuƒÅiwa, who later became King Kamehameha V. Evidence points toward Lot because Moses was expelled from the school two days before Maheha. He had also financially supported Maheha's husband Keaupuni. The entries from the period after September 1, 1845, were also torn out of Lot's school journal.  Upbringing and adulthood  Keanolani was raised by Princess Ruth Ke ªelik≈çlani, her namesake and the half-sister of Kamehameha V. Kamehameha V reigned from 1863 to his death on December 11, 1872, without acknowledging his daughter or naming an heir to the throne, and was succeeded by his cousin Lunalilo. Keanolani would not have been eligible to succeed Kamehameha V since the Hawaiian constitution only permitted succession through legitimate lines. Similarly, Albert K≈´nuiƒÅkea, the illegitimate son of Kamehameha III, had not been considered for the throne in 1854. Keaonolani became the mistress of her uncle by marriage William Hoapili Ka ªauwai (left), who was initially married to her half-aunt Kiliwehi (right). While still married to her first husband Lihilihi, Keanolani became the mistress of William Hoapili Ka ªauwai, an Anglican chaplain and a high chief of Mauian descent who had divorced her half-aunt Kiliwehi in 1872. During this period, Hoapili and Keanolani were partisans of King KalƒÅkaua, elected as monarch in 1874 after the death of King Lunalilo. Hoapili was promised the position of Royal Chamberlain in the new ruling household. Queen Emma, the widow of Kamehameha IV and former patron of Hoapili and Kiliwehi, noted the illicit affair in her letters in 1873. Commenting on September 20, Emma wrote, \\"Hoapili and Keano are at David‚Äôs [KalƒÅkaua's] Hamohamo. It is said she is with child by him again.\\" Later, on September 26, she noted, \\"Keano was here last evening and appeared to be looking thick round the waist. She reports Kiliwehi recovering under Dr. Hutchison‚Äôs treatment....\\" Keanolani had an illegitimate son which she named William Hoapili Ka ªauwai II, born on January 31, 1874. The elder Hoapili died on March 30, 1874. Keanolani became a friend of Queen Kapi ªolani, the wife of King KalƒÅkaua. According to the 1898 memoir of Lili ªuokalani, Keano and Princess Victoria Kinoiki Kekaulike carried the train of the robe of Queen Kapi ªolani during the 1883 coronation ceremony. They were both regarded as ‚Äúladies of high rank and noble lineages.‚Äù Few details exist on her life after this point until her death. In later life, she lived on the premises of Pualeilani, the Waikƒ´kƒ´ residence of Kapi ªolani. She continued living at Pualeilani when her nephews Princes David KawƒÅnanakoa and Jonah K≈´hi≈ç Kalaniana ªole inherited the property. At this point, the Hawaiian monarchy had been overthrown in 1893 and the islands subsequently annexed by the United States in 1898. Despite this, her rank was acknowledged during the birthday reception of the former Queen Lili ªuokalani in 1901. The press initially described her as \\"old and mentally infirm\\" but also commented favorably on her noble bearing and knowledge of court etiquette.; It was reported that she \\"swept majestically along amongst the throng as if she were a reigning queen\\" and \\"greeted the Queen as one high chieftess [sic] to another.\\" Keanolani died on June 30, 1902, while bathing at the beaches of Waikƒ´kƒ´ near Pualeilani. She died on the beach after a swim in the ocean.; ; ; The cause of death was reported as apoplexy in her obituaries due to the discoloration of her face, and the coroner ruled that it was due to \\"fatty degeneration of the heart.\\"; She died intestate and her daughter Kahaina petitioned to be appointed administratrix of the estate, which was valued at $2000.; ; After the autopsy, her remains laid in state at the bungalow of Pualeilani on July 1. The funeral service on the next day was conducted by Reverend Henry Hodges Parker, the pastor of Kawaiaha ªo Church. Her pallbearers included her son Hoapili Ka ªauwai II and her maternal uncle Palekaluhi. Her body was laid to rest at the Kawaiaha ªo Cemetery.  Marriage and descendants  Keanolani had a number of children. Her first husband was Lihilihi, from Kaua ªi, with whom she had a son named Samuela Kekuiapoiwa, who died on June 23, 1903. While still married to Lihilihi, Keanolani had an illegitimate son William Hoapili Ka ªauwai II, born on January 31, 1874, with her uncle by marriage William Hoapili Ka ªauwai.; She later divorced Lihilihi at the command of her aunt Ke ªelik≈çlani. She married a man named Kamali. Her obituary in 1902 reported, \\"Several years ago her husband [Kamali] went away into the mountains and nothing more was heard of him.\\" From this marriage, she had three children including Lot KapuƒÅiwa Kamehameha (1883/1884‚Äì1917), who died age 33,; Ke≈çp≈´olani, who married and had descendants with John Kali, and Olga Keahikuni Kekau ª≈çnohi (1889‚Äì1907), who died aged 18.; ; Another daughter mentioned in the sources was Kahaina, who petitioned to be appointed administratrix of her mother's estate after her death.

The shanks are first briefly sauteed with the ring-cut onions. The water is added, and bone-in lamb is boiled for about an hour before the vegetables are added.The dish may also be made terbiyeli, a variation that includes a sauce made from egg yolk, yogurt, flour and lemon juice that is added shortly before the dish is finished cooking.

Temerson imprints included Ultem Publications, Helnit Publishing, Et-Es-Go Magazines, and Continental Magazines. Notable titles published by Temerson included Captain Aero Comics, Cat-Man Comics, and Suspense Comics; notable characters included Cat-Man and Kitten and Miss Victory. L. B. Cole worked as an art director for many of Temerson's earliest comics; other notable creators associated with Temerson included Tony DiPreta, Irwin Hasen, Gil Kane, Don Rico, and Charles M. Quinlan. Temerson often used the names of family members and associates as proxies for companies which he actually owned and operated.  Biography  Temerson was born in Warsaw, Poland, the third child of Jacob (a dry goods merchant) and Mindel Temerson. In 1892, when Frank was two years old, his family moved to the United States, settling in Birmingham, Alabama. Frank's parents subsequently had four additional children, including Frank's younger sisters Esther, Goldie, and Ethel. The family were members of Birmingham's Temple Emanu-El synagogue, whose founding president was businessman, poet, and humanitarian Samuel Ullman. Temerson finished school after the eighth grade, going to work at his father's dry goods store. In 1913, despite never having gone to high school or college, Temerson was enrolled at the Chattanooga College of Law, which was not an accredited law school but which offered courses in legal studies. In 1914 Temerson was working as a \\"lawyer\\" (although he never graduated from the Chattanooga College of Law or passed the state bar exam). Temerson worked as an attorney in Birmingham for a couple of years before moving to Detroit in 1917. Shortly thereafter he registered with the draft board (where he was described as \\"short, stout, with brown eyes, brown hair, and partly bald\\"). Temerson served overseas with the Army during World War I from 1918‚Äì1919. Returning to Birmingham after the war, he soon connected with his old synagogue's president's nephew, I. W. (Isaac Wise) Ullman (1873‚Äì1947), who was also in the distribution business. Temerson and Ullman became business partners, moving into pulp magazine printing and distribution. Companies they jointly owned, under the name Ultem Publications (a combination of the first syllables from both names, Ullman and Temerson), included Vamos Color Printing and Inspirational Publications. By 1935, Ultem was headquartered in New York City, at 381 Fourth Avenue, and in 1937 the company was located at 404 Fourth Avenue. Ultem published Modern Movies, Movie Stars Handies, Movie Humor, High Heel Magazine, and Silk Stocking. In 1937, Ultem moved into the burgeoning comic book business. That year Ultem bought out Harry \\"A\\" Chesler's comic book titles Star Comics and Star Ranger. In September 1937, Ultem acquired the Comics Magazine Company's titles Funny Pages and Funny Picture Stories, retaining Chesler as the packager for both his own previous titles and the two that were continued from the Comics Magazine Co.\\"Ultem (1937-1938) at the Grand Comics Database Financial difficulties forced Ultem to sell some of its properties, including The Clock, to Everett M. \\"Busy\\" Arnold's Quality Comics.

The match became historically significant as the second longest men's singles match in terms of time played, in Wimbledon history, the longest remaining a 1989 second round match between Greg Holmes and Todd Witsken, which lasted five hours and twenty-eight minutes. The first semifinal of the women's singles saw four-time winner and defending champion, seventh seed Venus Williams dominate her opponent Elena Dementieva during the first set, winning it 6‚Äì1 in thirty-eight minutes, before the Russian fifth seed fought back in the second, breaking Williams right after losing her serve to even the score, and holding to a second set tie-break. The American then left no chances to Dementieva, breaking her repeatedly to win the tie-break 7‚Äì3, and claim a 6‚Äì1, 7‚Äì6(3) victory, after nearly two hours of play, to advance to her thirteenth Grand Slam final since the 1997 US Open, her seventh in Wimbledon. The second semifinal between two- time champion, sixth seed Serena Williams and wild card, WTA No. 133 Zheng Jie followed the same pattern as the first, with Williams dominating her opponent in the first set, winning it 6‚Äì2, and the Chinese fighting back in the second, taking the match to a tie-break after holding a set point on Williams's serve. Williams, though, kept her edge on Zheng, winning the tie-break 7‚Äì5, to claim a 6‚Äì2, 7‚Äì6(5) victory, and proceed to her eleventh Grand Slam final since the 1999 US Open, the fourth in Wimbledon. Venus and Serena Williams's wins marked the first time since Wimbledon 2003 the two sisters would meet in a Grand Slam final, the seventh time overall, with Serena having won five of their six previous Grand Slam final meetings, including the two played in Wimbledon, in 2002 and 2003. * Seeded players out: Elena Dementieva. In the first men's doubles semifinal, which lasted more than three hours, being interrupted several times by rain delays, World No. 1s and 2006 Wimbledon champions Bob Bryan & Mike Bryan battled a close match against eighth-seeded 2002, 2003 and 2004 champion Jonas Bj√∂rkman & partner Kevin Ullyett, but the top-ranked Americans lost all three tie-breaks played against their adversaries, allowing Bjorkman & Ullyett to win on the score of 7‚Äì6(3), 5‚Äì7, 7‚Äì6(5), 7‚Äì6(9). The win meant Bjorkman would reach his fifteenth Grand Slam doubles final since the 1994 French Open, Ullyett would reach his third one since the 2001 US Open, and the pair would reach their first Grand Slam final together. The other semifinal, between ninth seeds Luk√°≈° Dlouh√Ω & Leander Paes and second seeds Daniel Nestor & Nenad Zimonjiƒá was stopped due to darkness as the latter led 7‚Äì6(4), 4‚Äì6, 6‚Äì1, 3‚Äì3. The quarterfinals of the mixed doubles event continued, and saw all-Russian, unseeded pair of Igor Andreev & Maria Kirilenko upset all-Czech pair and third seeds Pavel V√≠zner & Kvƒõta Peschke in straight sets 6‚Äì3, 6‚Äì4, to reach their first Grand Slam semifinal together. In the second quarterfinal of the bottom half of the draw, unseeded team of men's doubles No. 1 Bob Bryan & former women's doubles No. 1 Samantha Stosur defeated ninth seeds and 2007 French Open mixed champions Andy Ram & Nathalie Dechy 6‚Äì4, 6‚Äì2, to join Jamie Murray & Liezel Huber in the semifinals. Finally, top seeds Mike Bryan & Katarina Srebotnik took three sets to beat their quarterfinal opponents, fifth-seeded Kevin Ullyett, who had just won his men's doubles semifinal, & Ai Sugiyama, Srebotnik's usual partner in women's doubles, on the score of 6‚Äì3, 3‚Äì6, 6‚Äì3, to set up to a clash with Andreev & Kirilenko, and complete the semifinals line up. * Seeded players out: Bob Bryan / Mike Bryan; Pavel V√≠zner / Kvƒõta Peschke, Andy Ram / Nathalie Dechy, Kevin Ullyett / Ai Sugiyama. (Pictures from Day 10) Day 11 The first semifinal of the men's singles was the eleventh encounter between World No. 1 and defending champion Roger Federer, and former World No. 1, now 75th-ranked and victor, earlier in the tournament, of ATP No. 3 Novak Djokovic, Russian Marat Safin, whose appearance in the semifinals was the first in a Grand Slam since he won the 2005 Australian Open, where he defeated Federer in the semifinal. The Swiss broke Safin in his first service game, racing through the first set to take it 6‚Äì3, before the Russian raised his level of play, and both players went on keeping their serves to a second set tie-break, which Safin eventually lost 3‚Äì7, letting Federer take his two-sets-to-love advantage to pressure him, and eventually break in the last game of the third set to claim a 6‚Äì3, 7‚Äì6(3), 6‚Äì4 victory, in less than two hours. The win meant Federer would reach his sixteenth Grand Slam final, and his sixth consecutive one in Wimbledon, already equalling Bj√∂rn Borg's record of runs at the tournament, from his first win at the 1976 Wimbledon Championships to his lost final, after having won five consecutive ones, to John McEnroe at the 1981 Wimbledon Championships. The second semifinal opposed ATP No. 2, French Open and Queen's Club Championships winner, and defending finalist Rafael Nadal, to unseeded, 2003 Australian Open runner-up Rainer Sch√ºttler, ATP No. 94, who finished his semifinal against Arnaud Cl√©ment only on the previous afternoon, after three- hours-and-a-half of play. Nadal raced early to a 4‚Äì0 lead, taking the first set 6‚Äì1, before Sch√ºttler started to fight back, breaking the Spanish and dominating him through the second set, keeping his serve until 5‚Äì4, when serving to even the score to one-set-all, Nadal broke him, eventually winning the set in a tie-break 7‚Äì3, and keeping his edge on the German up to the end of the third set to win, in little more than two hours, on the score of 6‚Äì1, 7‚Äì6(3), 6‚Äì4. The win allowed Nadal to advance to his seventh Grand Slam final, his third consecutive one in Wimbledon, and set up his eighteenth meeting against Roger Federer, the sixth in a Grand Slam final. * Seeded players out: None. The second men's doubles semifinal, between ninth seeds Luk√°≈° Dlouh√Ω & Leander Paes and second seeds Daniel Nestor & Nenad Zimonjiƒá, and which was stopped by the night on Day 10 as the latter were leading 7‚Äì6(4), 4‚Äì6, 6‚Äì1, 3‚Äì3, resumed, to see the Czech Dlouhy and the Indian, 1999 Wimbledon champion Paes break their opponents and win the fourth set, taking the match to a fifth one, in which 2002 Wimbledon doubles runner-up Nestor & 2004 and 2006 runner- up Zimonjic made the difference, ultimately clinching a 7‚Äì6(4), 4‚Äì6, 6‚Äì1, 4‚Äì6, 8‚Äì6 victory, to face Jonas Bj√∂rkman & Kevin Ullyett, and try, for Nestor, to finally complete a career Grand Slam and for Zimonjiƒá, to win his first ever Grand Slam title. The semifinals of the women's doubles took place, first confronting 2000 and 2002 champions and eleventh seeds Serena Williams & Venus Williams, to unseeded Frenchwoman Nathalie Dechy & Australian Casey Dellacqua, with the Williams sisters, who lost no set since the beginning of the competition, dominating their opponents throughout the encounter, winning the match 6‚Äì3, 6‚Äì3, after only an hour of play and advance to their third doubles final in Wimbledon, having won the two first ones. That win also marked the second time since the 2002 Wimbledon Championships Serena and Venus Williams would be facing each other in the singles final, and be present together in the doubles final. The top half of the draw's semifinal took place between top ranked, recent Birmingham and Eastbourne winners and defending champions Cara Black & Liezel Huber, and sixteenth-seeded 2001 doubles champion Lisa Raymond & partner Samantha Stosur, with the latter taking the early advantages in each set, breaking the World No. 1s four times during the encounter and eventually knocking them out of the tournament on the score of 6‚Äì3, 6‚Äì3, in little more than an hour, to reach their fourth Grand Slam final together, after the 2005 US Open, the 2006 Australian Open and the 2006 French Open. In the first semifinal of the mixed event, top seeds Mike Bryan & Katarina Srebotnik entirely dominated their unseeded opponents Igor Andreev & Maria Kirilenko to win the match on the final score of 6‚Äì4, 6‚Äì2, after little more than an hour, and proceed to their first Grand Slam final together. The win allowed Mike Bryan to advance to his fourth Grand Slam mixed final, his second in Wimbledon after finishing as the runner-up in 2001, and Srebotnik to advance to her eighth Grand Slam mixed final, her first in Wimbledon. Twelfth-seeded defending champion Jamie Murray & partner, women's doubles No. 1 Liezel Huber made the strongest start of their semifinal against unseeded Bob Bryan & Samantha Stosur quickly taking the first set 6‚Äì2 in twenty-one minutes, before Bryan & Stosur started to fight back, taking the second set to a tie-break, easily winning it 7‚Äì1, and extending their domination in the third set, eventually taking the match 2‚Äì6, 7‚Äì6(1), 6‚Äì4, to reach their first Grand Slam mixed doubles final together. The final would be Bob Bryan's sixth, the second in Wimbledon, after a 2006 loss, and Stosur's second, after the 2005 Australian Open.

Serena made the stronger start, breaking her sister in her first service game, and quickly took a 4‚Äì2 lead, as Venus struggled with her return. The momentum of the first set then shifted, when Venus started to play more aggressively, breaking Serena to even the score, and breaking her again in the last game to win the set 7‚Äì5 after fifty-three minutes. Venus struggled again with her serve in the beginning of the second set, saving a break point in her first service game, She was broken in her second, but broke back to 2‚Äì2. Both players then held their serve up to 5‚Äì4, when Serena found herself serving to stay in the match at 15-40, saving the first match point, but losing the second on an unforced error to give Venus the break and a 7‚Äì5, 6‚Äì4 victory after one hour and eleven minutes of play. The win allowed Venus to defend her title and was her fifth Wimbledon title, her seventh Grand Slam title overall. The men's doubles final followed the women's singles' one on Centre Court. The eighth-seeded team of ATP doubles No. 21 and former World No. 1 and three-time Wimbledon doubles champion Jonas Bj√∂rkman & current ATP doubles No. 14, partner Kevin Ullyett, the oldest pair in the field, both aged thirty-six, met the World No. 2 duo of Daniel Nestor, a Wimbledon 2002 runner-up & Nenad Zimonjiƒá, a finalist at the All England Lawn Tennis and Croquet Club in 2004 and 2006. Both teams remained close through the first two sets, with neither pair breaking the other, and each set going to a tie-break, the first won 14‚Äì12 by Nestor & Zimonjic, the second 7‚Äì3 by Bjorkman & Ullyett. The second seeds proved more efficient in the third set, winning their only break point and holding their advantage to the end to take a two-sets-to-one lead.

(Pictures from Day 12) Day 13 Roger Federer serves to win the third set tie-break. The final Sunday, featuring the men's singles final, saw Rafael Nadal win the first Wimbledon title of his career and fifth Grand Slam tournament. No. 1 seed and five-time champion Roger Federer was aiming to equal William Renshaw's record of six consecutive Wimbledon titles (1881‚Äì1886), and edge ever closer to Pete Sampras's record of 14 Grand Slam titles, of which Federer had 12. Nadal, the No. 2 seed and four-time French Open champion was Federer's challenger for the third consecutive year, and was aiming to become the first man since Bj√∂rn Borg to win the French Open and Wimbledon in the same year. Nadal's countryman, Manuel Santana, the last Spaniard to have won the Wimbledon title (in 1966), said Nadal could take inspiration from Spain's victory in the recent European Championships, which Spain had last won in 1964. Rafael Nadal climbs over a commentary box roof to receive the congratulations of Felipe, Prince of Asturias and his wife. Rain and lightning delayed the final, scheduled for 14:00, until 14:35 (UTC+1). The final itself was a fragmented affair, with two rain delays removing the possibility of an uninterrupted final. However, the playing time made it the longest final in Wimbledon history, at four hours and 48 minutes. Nadal began well, winning the first set 6‚Äì4 in just under an hour, and taking the second by the same scoreline, despite having been down 4‚Äì1 at one point. The third set was interrupted by rain delays but the players returned to finish the set with a tie break, which Federer won by seven points to five. The fourth mirrored the third by also going to a tie break, in which Nadal took a 5‚Äì2 lead. Nadal was on serve but served a double fault and then was forced by Federer into a hitting a backhand into the net. Later in the tie break, Nadal had two championship points, including one on his serve, which he squandered, with Federer triumphing 10-8, and forcing a final set. The fifth set went only four games before another rain delay; the score was 2‚Äì2 (40‚Äì40) when they returned. Nadal eventually prevailed, winning the final set 9‚Äì7, at 21:16 local time. Nadal celebrated his win by climbing to his family in the crowd, including coach Toni Nadal, and then traversed a roofed area to shake hands with members of Spanish royalty. Pundit and three-time Wimbledon champion John McEnroe lauded it as \\"the greatest match I have ever seen.\\" With a final score of 6-4 6-4 6-7(5) 6-7(8) 9-7. * Seeded players out: Roger Federer. In the mixed doubles' final, the Bryan brothers, Bob and Mike, met each other in the second siblings final of this year's tournament. The unseeded Bob and Samantha Stosur won the match in straight sets, 7‚Äì5, 6‚Äì4 against the first seeded Mike and Katarina Srebotnik, after one hour and one minute. * Seeded players out: Mike Bryan / Katarina Srebotnik.

The tertiary nerves are broadly reticulate. Between January and June inflorescent panicles of purple flowers with yellow interiors are produced. They are silken along their margins and smell of soap. The flowers bloom at night before fading at dawn. The brown, compressed and glabrous fruit is of capsule shape, long and wide. It is winged on both margins. The seeds are housed within two valves and are flat, chartaceous and winged on both sides. The trunk is occasionally buttressed and up to in diameter. The heartwood is white-brown coloured, and the pale grey outer bark is scaly and linearly lenticellate. Distribution This species can be most commonly found within the deciduous and semi-evergreen mountainous rainforests of India, Sri Lanka, Myanmar, Thailand, Peninsular Malaysia, Sumatra and Borneo, and up to 1000m above sea level. It is often spotted alongside rivers or within forests adjacent to the coast, and is occasionally found lonesome in the plains. Uses Pajanelia is used in parts of Malaysia, where it is commonly planted as stakes for hedges along rice fields, and is also planted as support tree in pepper plantations. The timber is suitable for woodworking purposes, such as building doors, wall panelling, domestic flooring, veneer and plywood, due to it being very hard and close grained. In conjunction with this, the wood has been used by the native Andamanese, who use the wood for house building, planking and canoe building. Pajanelia also has uses within traditional south Asian medicine. It may be resistant to white ant attacks, and is pollinated by various species of bats.

Solih was first elected to parliament in 1994, aged 30, as the MP from his home atoll of Faadhippolhu. Solih played a leading role in the formation of the Maldivian Democratic Party (MDP) and the Maldives Political Reform Movement from 2003 until 2008, which led to the country adopting a new modern constitution and multiparty democracy for the first time in its history. Solih was also a senior member of parliament and the Special Majlis. A founding member of the Maldivian Democratic Party, Solih was elected as President of Maldives on 23 September 2018 following the 2018 Maldives presidential election. Early and personal life Solih was born on Hinnavaru Island but moved to the Maldives' capital, Mal√© at a young age for education, and he has been a resident since. He is one of 13 children. Solih completed his secondary education at Majeedhiyya School, Mal√©. During his school days, he was a popular student and took part in several school activities, which especially applied to sports. He is married to Fazna Ahmed and they have a daughter named Sarah and a son named Yaman. Solih is one of the closest friends of former President Mohamed Nasheed, who is also the first cousin of Solih's wife Fazna. Solih and President Nasheed played an instrumental role in establishing multiparty democracy in the Maldives. Ibrahim Mohamed Solih has been a senior figure in the party and leads the first Parliamentary Group of the Maldivian Democratic Party (MDP) in 2009. Political career Solih has been the parliamentary group leader of the Maldivian Democratic Party (MDP) since 2011.He has also served as the leader of the joint parliamentary group since the opposition coalition was formed in March 2017. Solih was selected as the new presidential candidate for the coalition of opposition parties in the 2018 election, when former president Mohamed Nasheed, due to his prior conviction, was not able to contest as a candidate for presidential election. Solih went on to claim an upset victory over Yameen, winning the election with 58.4% of the vote and receiving nearly 38,500 votes more than his opponent. In the run-up to the election, many foreign observers had asserted that the election could be rigged in Yameen's favor and that he was thus likely to win a second term. However, when the counting of ballots was nearing completion on election night, President Yameen addressed the nation and conceded the election to Solih, this being a few hours after the latter had claimed victory and urged the president for a peaceful transition of power. The main issue of the campaign has widely been recognized as the question of whether the Maldives should continue to pursue closer relations with the People's Republic of China, as it has done under the Yameen presidency, or whether it should instead turn to India and the countries of the Western world (especially the United States), which is a direction more favoured by the MDP-led opposition coalition. =Presidency= Solih assumed office on 17 November 2018, when the five-year term of Abdulla Yameen expired. Solih became the 7th President of the Maldives and the country's third democratically elected president (following Mohamed Nasheed and Abdulla Yameen) since Nasheed unseated Maumoon Abdul Gayoom in the 2008 election, thus ending the latter's 30-year long, six- term incumbency. Solih is the first Maldivian president to be born in the country's northern atolls, as well as the second-oldest person to assume the presidency, at the age of 54 (with only Mohamed Waheed Hassan being older when taking office). On 19 November, Solih announced that the Maldives is to return to the Commonwealth of Nations, a decision recommended by his Cabinet, considering that the Maldives was a Commonwealth republic from 1982 to 2016. President Solih became a Commonwealth head of government when the Maldives returned to the Commonwealth on 1 February 2020.

The groundbreaking ceremony took place on July 24, 2018. Naming rights for the stadium were purchased by British information technology company Aveva, and was opened on April 13, 2019. Aveva Stadium is the first stadium in the league built specifically for use by Major League Rugby, and the second rugby-specific stadium primarily for professional competition in the United States. History =Planning and funding= Construction of restrooms and locker rooms with east side stands and pavilion In March 2017, local rugby organization and predecessor to the Houston SaberCats, the Houston Strikers publicly announced their plans to build a stadium at the Houston Sports Park located roughly three miles from NRG Park and eight miles from Downtown Houston along the South Freeway. The group also released several other key details such as early renderings, an estimated cost of $10 million, and a 5,000 person initial capacity. Leading up to the inaugural season of the team, the City of Houston agreed to partially fund a permanent stadium with a contribution of $3.2 million in February 2018. The ownership group expects to invest an additional $12.0 million of their own funds to construct the 3-field, multi-use facility. Details of the deal, outlined in Houston City Ordinance 2018‚Äì0085, also confirmed the construction on city-owned property in south Houston at Houston Sports Park, with the city maintaining ownership and leasing stadium grounds back to the team for a 43-year term. =Design and construction= On July 8, the Houston SaberCats released new preliminary architectural drawings and a groundbreaking announcement for July 24, 2018 via Instagram and then via press release several days later. On July 17, the SaberCats announced naming rights were awarded to Aveva. The groundbreaking ceremony took place on July 24, 2018, with the mayor of Houston, Sylvester Turner, representing the city. =Opening and current use= Construction was still ongoing as Aveva Stadium opened on April 13, 2019 with a game against the Seattle Seawolves. After its inauguration, previous games were played before the grand opening, which was postponed and took place on May 29, 2019. The Houston team played against the Glendale Raptors. Facilities Aveva Stadium's overall facilities include a 1,200 parking lot and two secondary fields for multipurpose use. While seating capacity exceeds 3,000, the stadium features up to 4,000 maximum capacity by utilizing standing room only areas. The venue is primarily the home of the Houston SaberCats professional Rugby team but can accommodate other sports and non-sports events due to the large size of the fields.

It was designed by Leonardo da Vinci around 1485 and was drawn on sheets 143r, 153r and 155r of the Codex Atlanticus. However there is no evidence that it was ever made or used in Leonardo's time, or had any effect on military history. Design Mechanically, the rapid fire crossbow's tiller was split into two stacked wooden pieces held together at the front by a hinge and held in place at the back by a spring-loaded latch. Sandwiched inside the tiller, a pair of interconnected folding levers attach the lower half of the tiller to a sliding plank sitting on the top half of the tiller between the two metal prods, similar in mechanical concept to the Gastraphetes, that contained the rolling nut and spring-loaded sear at the back of the plank. Meanwhile the bottom half of the tiller contained the trigger. Upon pressing a switch on the side of the tiller to release the latch, the user can then fold the bottom half of the tiller down. At the same time, the interconnected levers then push the sliding plank forward until the drawstring is caught by the rolling nut, which is held secure by the sear's spring tension. Upon pushing the bottom half of the tiller back into place, the latch locks the upper and lower halves of the tiller back together. After a bolt is loaded on the crossbow and aimed, the trigger is then pulled to compress the sear's spring and enable the rolling nut to release the drawstring to propel the bolt. Leonardo da Vinci did not limit himself to the study and improvement of what was available in his time. But he produced a real invention that, if concretely realized, could change the strategies on the battlefield and, consequently, the course of history. Working replica After a prototype built in 2013, the first working model was released on 24 June 2015 during a demonstration at the Castello Sforzesco in Milan. The working replica was the culmination of a study conducted by Edoardo Zanon of the Leonardo3 study center in respect of the processing and assembly techniques available at the time of Leonardo. The model allows precision shooting and is equipped with a fast internal spanning mechanism, non-existent even in most modern crossbows. The working model built is on display at the museum Leonardo3 ‚Äì The World of Leonardo in Piazza della Scala, Milan, Italy.

The tumulus is a two-tier dome-shape, with a diameter of 60 meters at its base, 49 meters at its upper tier, and 8 meters in height. The periphery of the mound was surrounded by a circumferential moat 15 meters in width, of which a small portion survives in the northeastern sector. It is the largest circular kofun found in Fukui Prefecture. No fukiishi or cylindrical haniwa have found in the area, and the details of the interior are unknown as the kofun has not been excavated; however, rom the morphology of the mound it is estimated to date from the 5th century AD. The tomb does not appear in any historical records and the name of rank of the person buried within is unknown.

Plot The story is about a couple, Vivek and Ann. For their wedding anniversary, Ann decides to surprise her husband by inviting his close friends Sudheesh, Ajith, Gopan and Swathi home. Vivek and his four friends grew up in the same orphanage and became best friends. On receiving Ann's invitation, the four friends working in different places unite and show up at Vivek's place to surprise him. Ajith is fond of photography; he clicks snaps of Vivek's reaction on seeing his friends, but later his camera doesn't work. Also, mirrors don't last in the house. Vivek narrates to them the story of the foreign couple who resided in the bungalow a long time ago, and it is believed by the natives that the house is haunted by their spirits. Vivek later asks his friends not to be worried about Ann if she behaves strangely, as she is mentally upset about her miscarriage. Slowly the friends experience strange activities in the house. Gopan and Sudheesh mistake that Swathi is possessed and decide to get holy water from the church. Meanwhile, Swathi decorates the hall and slips from the stool while decorating the wall. A cupboard with sharp articles almost falls over her but is held back by a force. Swathi turns around to find Ann holding back the cupboard and the knives with her powers. Swathi is terrified and runs out. Sudheesh and Gopan arrive and splash the holy water on her. Swathi reveals to them that Ann is the one who is possessed. They splash the water in the knife which Ann would touch to cut their Anniversary cake. Ann feels a shock aa soon as she touches the knife, thus revealing to Sudheesh, Gopan and Swathi that she is truly possessed. Ann warns the three not to utter a word about this to Vivek and to leave the next day. The three inform Ajith about Ann but he doesn't believe them. Later when he gets his camera back from the repair shop, he sees that Ann is not captured in any of the pictures where she was actually present. He then confirms it by clicking a few pictures of Ann. Ajith tries to inform Vivek about Ann but she somehow manages to divert him from his friends. When the friends wanted to leave, she asks them not to, knowing that they would bring someone to chase her. Later when Sudheesh tries to leave the house, he is beaten and threatened by Ann. Sudheesh's uncle who claims himself to be a Brahmin who could chase ghosts, enters the house on Sudheesh's request. Ann threatens him too. Later Ajith manages to show the camera pictures to Vivek, but the pictures don't exist anymore. They then decide to perform a drama to take Vivek out from the house. Sudheesh acts like having stomach pain, and all of them rush him to the car, Vivek forgets his purse and the friends ask Ann to go and bring it. The friends previously splashed holy water in few places in the house and Ajith goes back to the house and locks Ann and sprays the holy water on the door. The friends immediately leave with Vivek. Halfway through they remember that they left Sudheesh's uncle in the house, who opens the door of the room where Ann is locked. The atmosphere seems to change and the friends understand that Ann is out. The friends rush Vivek into a church and reveal to him about Ann. Vivek is confused and doesn't believe his friends. Ajith pushes Vivek near a sharp object, knowing that Ann would appear to save him. Ann saves him and Vivek gets to see the real face of Ann. Vivek reveals to everyone that he already knew everything about Ann. When Ann went into labour, Vivek could not get help as the land phone was not working. He rushed Ann to the hospital on his bike and they met with an accident hitting a huge boulder. Vivek fell on the ground but Ann fell off the cliff into the river below. Vivek tried to help Ann but he lost consciousness. When he opened his eyes in the hospital, he saw Ann and was happy that she was safe.

Also he avoided his friends and others to protect this secret. Ann on hearing the truth decides to leave Vivek and go, but Vivek convinces Ann to live the way that they have been living. After a year the friends again meet up this time with the addition of Sudheesh's wife. Sudheesh's wife is petrified to get out of the car. Ann then goes and brings her into the house with care. All of them get along well and click a picture. Then goes a voice-over of Ann saying, that she knows she would never appear in the picture, but the picture would be close to her heart.

In an interview, regarding the film, Syam said, \\"The film is about friendship, love, fantasy and also has a little bit of horror thrown in. Sugeeth has been particular that since his first film, the title or the tagline be related to the story and the tagline of this film - ‚Äòbased on a fake story‚Äô - too has relevance with the film\\". Unlike his previous films, it will be the first time the director Sugeeth is working in a film with no established artists. The film introduces six new artists to the film industry. Vivek Menon and Shashwath Sunil Kumar, are performing the cinematography and music direction respectively. On being asked why he chose to work with newcomers, Sugeeth was quoted as saying \\"A film is not only about the profits that can be made. It is also about giving opportunities to newcomers when everything falls into place, which happened in my case. The story of Kinavalli took shape when a large group of us were sitting together and swapping tales. And this story called for fresh faces, which too fell into place.\\" The first look poster was launched on Valentine's Day 2018 in a Dubai Radio Channel, Hit 96.7 FM by actor/RJ Nyla Usha  Release  The film was released on 27 July 2018 to positive reviews. The Times of India gave it a 3.5 out of 5 and, in its review, praised the performances of the newcomers \\"The youngsters charge the frames with their electric performance, seamlessly switching back and forth from comedy to sober seriousness\\" and also goes on to say, \\"Kinavalli is a horror-fantasy tailor-made for the family audience. It doesn‚Äôt depend on an excess of graphics or loud thuds or crashes to create the spooks. Neither does it creep on you to scare you out of your wits. Instead it comes with some clean comedy, subtle scares and a hard sell of a climax. But then again, when the makers term the movie to be ‚Äúbased on a fake story‚Äù, you mustn‚Äôt really apply logic because they've already asked you not to.\\" The Deccan Chronicle mentioned \\"All credits to Sugeeth for breaking out of his comfort zone and not hanging on to his usual cast. He has shown the courage to bank on the untried fantasy-horror genre, with a string of newcomers, who have done their best to make the movie engaging. Sugeeth has proved that he is capable of pulling off other genres well too. The script written by Sheethal Shyam and Vishnu Ramachandran has an adequate mix of comedy and uncanny moments. Vivek Menon‚Äôs cinematography blends well with the mood of the movie.\\" while giving it a 3.5 on 5.. Manorama Online summarised Kinavalli as \\"a complete entertainer with twists\\", while Sify, termed it as \\"a paisa vasool entertainer\\" stating that \\"Kinavalli may not offer you too many surprises or scare the hell out of the viewer.

Colonial era  Standing on Prinsen Straat, the Amsterdamsche Poort (Amsterdam Gate) can be seen from a distance. In 1867, Dutch photographer Jacobus Anthonie Meesen immortalized through a photo Prinsen Straat with the Amsterdam Gate in the background. He took pictures from the intersection of Prinsen Straat, Pasar Pisang (Banana Market), and Leeuwinnen Straat (now Jalan Cengkeh, Jalan Kalibesar Timur 3, and Jalan Kunir). The position of the Amsterdam Gate faces the stadhuis or town hall, which is now the Jakarta History Museum. Immigrants from Europe who visited Batavia by sea before 1885, before the port of Tanjung Priok was completed, would dock at the port of Sunda Kelapa and continue along the southern side of Prinsen Straat. They continue southward towards Weltevreden (now Sawah Besar). In the 1860s, Prinsen Straat was one of the busiest streets with business and trade activities constantly taking place during the day. At night, the area is generally deserted because most European workers prefer to live in the fancier part of town, Weltevreden. Until the 20th century, the Prinsen Straat area was filled with European offices, warehouses and industrial buildings. The Amsterdamsche Poort, wrote Scott Merrllees in his book Batavia in The Nineteenth Century Photographs, was the only relic of Batavia Castle destroyed by Herman Willem Daendels in ca. 1808-1809.

Most of his career was spent with Lechia Gda≈Ñsk, spending over 15 years at the club. He also had short spells with Gedania Gda≈Ñsk, OWKS Lublin, and CWKS Warszawa. He received 32 caps for Poland between 1952‚Äì1959. Biography =Early years= Korynt was born in Tczew in 1929. Both of his parents came from Kociewie, with his fathers parents both being Greek emigrants with the families name originally being Korinth. Originally his sporting passion started with boxing training with MKS Wybrze≈ºe while also developing a passion for football at this time joining Grom Gdynia. Korynt joined Gedania Gda≈Ñsk in 1948 playing with the club for just over a season before being called up into the army. =Military service= In 1949 Korynt started his mandatory conscription, being placed in a unit of ordinary conscripts and not a unit of athlete conscripts. Zbigniew Pi√≥rkowski, a well known boxer who Korynt was friends with ordered that Korynt should be in a unit with athletic conscripts. Korynt was then transferred to OWKS Lublin as part of his military service. His performances with OWKS Lublin caught the attention of the Central Military Sports Club () and was transferred to CWKS Warszawa in 1951 for the remainder of his military service. During his time with CWKS he made 15 league appearances and 6 in the Polish Cup. He left CWKS in 1952 after his military service was completed. =Lechia Gda≈Ñsk= Korynt moved back to the Tricity area where he grew up and joined Lechia Gda≈Ñsk. He made his Lechia debut on 15 March 1953 against Cracovia in a 0-0 draw. In his first season with Lechia they suffered relegation to the second tier, winning promotion the season after back into the I liga. In 1955 Lechia reached the Polish Cup final by beating Kolejarz Nowy SƒÖcz, Wis≈Ça Krak√≥w, Gwardia Warszawa and Odra Opole to play CWKS Warszawa in the final. Korynt played 4 times in the cup run, including playing in the final, which CWKS Warszawa won 5-0. The following season in 1956 was to see the biggest success in Lechia's early history with the team finishing 3rd in the I liga. At the beginning of the season many expected Lechia to be fighting for their position to stay in the league. Despite only scoring 25 goals in 22 games, performances from Korynt helped the side to limit the amount of goals they conceded with the team keeping 9 clean sheets in the 22 game season. After the 3rd place finish Lechia started to face a gradual decline in on-field performances, with the team being relegated to the II liga at the end of the 1962‚Äì63 season. It was in the II liga where Korynt has his greatest success in terms of goals scored, scoring 5 in the 1964‚Äì65 season. After Lechia suffered another relegation, this time to the III liga, Korynt played 7 times before retired from professional football, having played his last game against Arkonia Szczecin. Korynt made a total of 340 appearances for Lechia, 207 of which were in the top tier. Korynt is currently the only Lechia player to have made over 200 appearances in the top division. =International career= On 25 May 1952 Korynt made his Poland international debut against Romania. In total he earned 32 caps for Poland between 1952 and 1959. His most famous international game coming on 20 October 1957 against the Soviet Union with Poland winning the game 2-1. Personal life and death His son is Tomasz Korynt, was also a footballer. He has been awarded with three decorations; the Cross of Merit in 1995, the Knight's Cross of the Order of Polonia Restituta in 2001, and the Order of Polonia Restituta in 2011. Korynt is commemorated by a star at the MOSiR Stadium in Gda≈Ñsk. The \\"Avenue of Stars\\" commemorates the efforts and success of former players and coaches.

It was designed by Mark Woodforde and built in 1936. It was added to the New South Wales State Heritage Register on 25 August 2017.  History  = Aboriginal pre-contact and contact history = The land where the small northern NSW town of Bingara is now located is at about the north western extent of the traditional country of the Kamilaroi Aboriginal people. The western side of the Gwydir River was the traditional country of the Weraerai Aboriginal people. Kamilaroi hunted the abundant stock of small marsupials. They aided their hunting efforts by using fire to ensure the underbrush did not become too dense, thereby creating an open forest environment.Graham Wilson, 2006, Gwydir Shire Council Thematic History Study The first documented European exploration of the area was by botanist and explorer Allan Cunningham during his exploratory trip to the Darling Downs. Cunningham passed through the area, camping at Halls Creek where the town of Bingara is today in 1827.(A. J.Bert 2009. The Bingera Run). By the mid 1830s the area was known as Stodderts Valley and was adequately watered by the Gwydir River and its tributaries such as Halls Creek near Bingara. Its good soils and abundant water had attracted a number of squatters who claimed runs in the nearby area. The valley land was taken up by the Hall family who already had considerable claims on land in the Hunter Valley and in the Hawkesbury. As the squatters became more numerous and the resources of the land and cattle was contested between the Aboriginal people and the Europeans, numerous attacks occurred by both Europeans and Aboriginals. These escalated during the 1830s and culminated in one of the most renowned of the attacks, the Myall Creek massacre of 18 December 1838. A group of armed men headed by John Flemming of Mungie Bungie Station near Moree rode out to Myall Creek Station where they found and killed a group of about 30 men, women and children of the Weraerai and Kamilaroi peoples. The perpetrators were tried and eventually 7 of the 12 men involved were hanged. This was the first time the killers of Aboriginal people were executed by the Colonial Government of New South Wales.(Bert 2009 and Wilson, 2006.) = Discovery of gold = In 1851 Gold was discovered in the Bingara area on Keera Station and a few months later at Cobidah Creek on the Bingara Run. As usual a rush of fortune seekers made their way to the area and further gold discoveries were made in 1852 leading to the proclamation of the Bingara goldfield in 1853.Bert 2009 = Bingara township = To support the population of gold seekers the town of Bingera was surveyed and set out. By 1853, William Hall of the Bingera Run had set up the first hotel, the Bingera Inn, in Bingera. In that same year the first general store was opened. By 1862 Bingera and its population of ninety was serviced by a Post Office and law and a Watch House and Lock up was established in the town. In that year Bingera Public School was also established. The real boom period for the town of Bingera occurred after the discovery of copper and diamonds in the area in 1872-3. During the 1880s Bingara became the largest producer of diamonds in Australia and remains one of the most successful diamond mines in Australia.(Bingara NSW in http://www.aussie towns.com.au/town/bingara-nsw) During the 1870s and 1880s the civic amenity of the town continued to grow with the establishment of a courthouse, Royal Mail Booking Office and several churches, Catholic, Church of England and Presbyterian. In addition to mining, the town supported the timber and wheat industries as well as the ongoing pastoral and agricultural industries. In 1889 Bingera was made a municipality and its name changed to Bingara. By 1891 Bingara's population was 738 and in 1911, over 1600 residents were located in the town.('Bingara' in Australian Heritage http://wwwheritageaustralia.com .au/new-south-wales/3175-bingara, Bert 2009 Bingara NSW in http://www.aussietowns.com.au/town/bingara-nsw) Despite the impacts of the Great Depression throughout New South Wales, the 1930s proved to be a time of expansion and improvement for Bingara with Bingara Council receiving many requests to construct residences, shops, and businesses. Wilson notes that the arrival of a number of Greek businessmen in the town, coupled with the plans to develop the Copeton Dam situated a few 55 kilometres east of Bingara may have contributed to the small boom experienced in Bingara at this time. = The influence of the Greeks on the spread and popularity of cinema in NSW = Among the \\"Greek businessmen\\" Wilson mentions were three men from the Greek island of Kythira, who were integral to the story of the Roxy Cinema, Emanuel Aroney, George Psaltis and Peter Feros. These men, like many Greeks at the time left their home to flee the ongoing economic, social and political upheaval experienced as a result of the conflict between Greece and Turkey in the late 19th and early 20th centuries. America was the most popular destination for those seeking a better life but this destination was restricted by the imposition of strict quotas on arrivals from South and Eastern Europe to America in 1924. Consequently there was a marked influx of Greek migrants to Australia in the 1920s. Many of those in the arriving in NSW at the time came from the island of Kytheria and many of them established refreshment bars, milk bars and also cinemas throughout the suburbs of Sydney and in rural NSW.C Turnbull and C Valotis 2001, The History of the Roxy Theatre and Cafe and the creation of the Roxy Museum and K Cork 1998 Kevin Cork in his thesis notes that around 66 Greek businessmen and women were involved in establishing and managing cinemas in NSW from 1917, when Angleo Coronis established himself as a film exhibitor in Sydney, right through to 1984 when Chris James finally retired after 38 years in the business.K Cork 1998 Some of those Greek exhibitors ran multiple theatres in several towns either simultaneously or as serial operations. Sir Nicholas Laurantus bought and built cinemas in Narrandera, Junee, Tumut, Lockhart, Cowra Hillston and Gundagai, often installing family members to run them. In fact Laurantas brother-in-law Peter Stathis and his sons ran the Montreal Theatre in Tumut from 1930 to 1965. Similarly the Hatsatouris family ran a chain of cinemas in Port Macquarie, Taree, Walcha and Laurieton. Others families such as the Notaras initially operated only one theatre, the Saraton Theatre in Grafton. They then leased out the theatre until the 1960s. Recently the Notaras family have reopened the theatre. A survey of cinemas in NSW undertaken in 1962 indicated there were 351 enclosed cinemas in 289 NSW rural towns. Of these, between 1915 and 1960, 116 theatres in NSW were at some time operated by Greek exhibitors in 57 towns. 34 new theatres were built by Greek businessmen in those 57 towns. These figures demonstrate that the contribution of these Greek migrants to the social and cultural life of NSW was not insignificant.C Turnbull and C Valotis 2001 Generally speaking, the decades from the 1930s to the mid 1960s were the boom time for cinemas and cinema going. From the early travelling cinema exhibitors enterprising business people chose to market cinema going as a glamorous and exciting social activity and built virtual pleasure palaces in which to screen the best of Hollywood films. Even in rural NSW towns a rash of attractive and glittering picture palaces were built in the architectural styles popular at the time from Interwar Stripped Classical and Interwar Spanish Mission to high Art Deco. The elaborate and modern architecture style of these buildings gave theatre going a sense of occasion and glamour.(Ross Thorne, 1995. Cinema as Place: The case of picture theatres in a group of towns and villages in the Central West of NSW) = The Roxy, Bingara = It was with this dream, to woo their audience with a sense of glamour and occasion when they visited the theatre, that the Aroney, Feros and Psaltis began plans for the Roxy. The plans included not only a luxurious new theatre and refreshment rooms but three independent state of the art shops and also a guest house in which attendees from more remote rural locations could rest for the night. When they first arrived in Australia in the mid 1920s, the three men had decided to try their luck setting up a business in the small rural town of Bingara. They established a cafe and formed a partnership, Peters and Co. Their cafe interests expanded to include another cafe in Barraba in 1930 and they successfully traded through the worst of the Great Depression on the strength of these enterprises.The Roxy and Greek Cafe Bingara By 1934 they had purchased a large corner site on Maitland and Cunningham Street and engaged a Sydney architect, W. V. E. Woodforde to draw up plans for the entertainment and retail complex. By 1935 construction had begun. The theatre auditorium was to be 104 feet long by 40 feet wide. The floor of the auditorium was to a section of raked seating with the section nearest to the stage comprising a level floor with seating that would be taken up to reveal a specially constructed waltz dance floor of cypress pine. Unfortunately the build was subject to a number of alterations that resulted in extra time and expense. One of the alterations was to heighten the auditorium walls by 4 feet 6 inches to allow for the possible later inclusion of a dress circle. This brought about changes in decorative treatments of the main ceiling and proscenium.Georgia Standerwick, 2016 It is thought that other obstacles to the speedy construction of the theatre may have been posed by the Greek partners' competitor in the Bingra cinema trade, a Mr Victor Reginald Peacoke who was Mayor of the local Council at the time. With the announcement of the plans for the Roxy, Peacocke determined to build another new purpose built cinema in the town, The Regent. He continued to wage a campaign to forestall the construction of the Roxy by lobbying the Chief Secretary of NSW who had charge of cinema licensing and regulation, and weighing-in his influence in the local Council which approved the building work. The new Regent was completed significantly earlier than the Roxy thus capitalizing on the loyalty of potential Roxy audience. After the Roxy opened in March 1936, Peacock continued to vie for audience share by slashing his entry prices, which the Roxy partners had to match, and making improvements such as the installation of an advanced sound system. In response the Roxy hosted a gala \\"Movie Ball\\" and \\"Uncle George Psaltis declares he is going as Shirley Temple and has been measured up for a special dress\\".(Bingara Advocate, in P Prineas, 2008. Katsehamos and the Great Idea) Finally Peacock out maneuvered Aroney, Feros and Psaltis when he opened an open-air picture theatre at the rear of the new Regent. This coupled with the severe debt due to the construction costs of the ambitious Roxy project was the undoing of the enterprise. In August 1936 the theatre operator, Peters & Co., went bankrupt. Aroney remained in Bingara managing cafes for the next 20 years. Feros moved to Victoria and Psaltis returned to Bingara after some time in Sydney and managed the Roxy cafe for a time. The Roxy Theatre operated as a cinema under other ownership until 1958 when it shut down. Apart from the occasional films screening, odd boxing match or roller disco, it lay dormant for the next 40 years. The virtual abandonment experienced by the Roxy from the 1960s to the late 1990s was a fate shared by numerous rural suburban and city film theatres, many of which were established prior to WWII. The widespread uptake of television is given as the primary reason for the decline in cinema going generally. As a result of this it seems that this type of building is becoming rarer in NSW country towns. In 2003 it was noted by Ross Thorne that only 31 of the 351 cinemas in rural NSW were still recognisable as cinemas. Many of these have been deployed for such diverse uses as apartment blocks, bargain centres, function centres, motor mechanic premises. Only 11 of the 31 retain their decorative interiors and exteriors.(R Thorne. 2003.) A desktop survey of remaining cinemas in country towns indicates that around only seven Interwar cinemas in rural NSW towns retain their original format and interior/exterior architectural features and decorative schemes and still operate as theatres. Of these the Roxy in Bingara is the best example of an Art Deco Cinema. The Roxy Cafe continued to operate under a series of Greek owners until the mid-1960s when it became a freehold title and was sold to Bob and Elva Kirk who opened a memorabilia shop in the cafe, and who lived above it in the residence. It then was used as a Chinese restaurant for 20 years before being purchased by the Gwydir Shire Council in 2008. In the early 1990s a group of dedicated community members first recognised the Roxy's significance and began to lobby the then Bingara Shire Council to purchase and restore the theatre. The Bingara Council purchased the building in 1999 and once it had been successful in obtaining both state and federal funding, set about faithfully restoring it to its former glory. Today the building complex houses the local tourist information office in one of the shops and a museum celebrating Greek history in NSW operates in another of the shops. The cafe has been leased in recent years but now, in the absence of a long term lease, it accommodates pop-up cafes. The theatre is in great demand these days as a live performance venue, a film club venue, for civic receptions, weddings and reunions. The accommodation above the cafe is a convention centre and office/storage area. At the rear of the theatre an extension to the backstage area was constructed in 2007. This was funded by the Department of Education to facilitate the local school's Theatre Studies. It was constructed by a \\"work for the dole\\" team of student workers. In 2012 a further addition to the rear of the theatre was an industrial kitchen where trade courses in hospitality are run by the local TAFE. The kitchen allows catering for the various functions that happen at the theatre. = Comparisons = Greek cafes left a remarkable legacy on Australia's cultural history and played a significant role in the changing landscape of our regions. Almost every town across rural NSW and Queensland boasted a Greek cafe. Greek family owned cafes in northern New South Wales which have closed in recent years include The Busy Bee in Gunnedah, the White Rose in Uralla, Fardouly's Cafe and Pete's Place in Inverell. Still operating are The Paragon in Katoomba and the Niagara in Gundagai, in continuous operation for over a century. The survival of a guesthouse for patrons, adjoining the Roxy Bingara (to the rear), is rare and possibly unique among surviving Greek cafes in NSW. > The Greeks really transformed Australia's culinary and cultural landscape\\" > Mrs McNaughton said. \\"Prior to the Greek cafes there wasn't anywhere > families could go.

Even during the depression, locals would make an effort to visit the cafe.Johnston, 2012  Description  Entrance The Roxy Theatre embraces some of the most striking original Art Deco architecture in New South Wales and it still contains the original fixtures and fittings, including the ornate stucco plaster, paintwork and coloured lights from 1936. The theatre complex faces Maitland street and has three shops and a cafe with the theatre entrance positioned centrally. The complex as a whole is a rectangular interpretation of the Art Deco style, with a stepped silhouette, pilasters and entablature and simple panelling to break up its cement-rendered wall surface. The pilasters feature stylised low relief decorative patterns. The two shops to the south and one shop to the north of the theatre entrance feature large chrome framed shopfronts with a recessed entry and chrome stepped art deco motif at the top of each window and entry. This stepped motif is echoed in the parapet of the theatre entrance and is picked out in the original colour scheme of white, blue, maroon and a lighter shade of maroon. The entrance to the theatre is via two timber framed glass double doors which are either side of the ticket office in the entrance portico (typical of American cinema entrances). Cafe The cafe is located to the north of the theatre on the corner of Maitland and Cunningham street. Its street entrance is a handsome set of three timber framed glass folding doors with the large chrome framed windows either side. The painted glass sign \\"Peter's Cafe\\" above the doorway is framed in the stepped chrome motif. The Maitland street facade of the complex is tiled with square black tiles. The Cunningham street side of the cafe features elements of the Interwar Spanish Mission architecture with arched windows, stucco finish and Spanish tiled roof. Entry to the theatre auditorium is through a long, narrow vestibule. The floor here is terrazzo and the vestibule ceiling features a large stepped cornice with a decorative grille utilising a typical art deco pattern located along the centre of the ceiling. A short flight of steps leads up to the auditorium entry doors. The rear section of the auditorium is stepped and seating is fixed, whereas the front section is flat (for dances) and seating is moveable. The floor of the front section is of cypress pine and laid as a \\"waltz\\" floor to facilitate balls and dancing. Auditorium seating The auditorium decoration repeats the stepped motif of the facade, the ceiling stepping down to meet the walls at an entablature seemingly supported by pilasters. A wavy Art Deco frieze on the entablature and the perforated panels between the pilasters contrast with the angular theme. The wall panels comprise two elements, a central vertical row of five perforated, fan-like elements on each side of which is a vertical row of six rectangles containing diagonal strapping. The light fittings on the pilasters and proscenium splays are designed as angular vase elements. A number of these wall panels are fixed over the shuttered openings to the outside. These as well as the decorative grille running the length of the ceiling in the auditorium were incorporated as a way of ensuring air circulation and cooling in summer and were closed in winter. The whole auditorium features a complex and pleasing original paint scheme and elements of decorative plaster. These and the lavish decorative elements assisted in giving the experience of theatre-going a sense of occasion. The theatre originally had a low stage which has been removed. The back stage area has been slightly extended to allow for modern day use as a performance venue. An extension to the side of the theatre behind the cafe has been made to accommodate a commercial kitchen, once again to allow for the theatre to be used for a variety of uses - education facility, theatre and event function facility. To the south of the theatre entrance vestibule is the original refreshment bar and passed that one of the original shops which has been set up as a museum celebrating Greeks in NSW. Further south is one other shop which was originally a doctor's surgery. On the northern side of the entry vestibule is the third shop which is used as an extension of the entry vestibule. Further north is Peter's Cafe which is now entered from the theatre entry by a ramp. The cafe floor is terrazzo laid in a geometric pattern and the ceiling is a plaster with timer lattice and a patterned cornice. The cafe's timber dining booths are original as is the timber wall panelling except for that alongside the disability ramp which is a fairly recent addition. While the front bar is original, some of the cafe furniture has been sourced from Fardouli's cafe in Inverell. Detail The area above the cafe was originally accommodation for those who ran it. It is now used as a conference venue. Its layout and detailing internally is unchanged and features a large living dining room with access to the outside stairway to Cunningham street. There is a small kitchenette, an office and several bedrooms and bathroom and a toilet for cafe/theatre patrons. A lift has been installed on the landing of the stairway from the ground floor. This stairway features a metal balustrade with a distinctive art deco decorative motif which is found throughout the theatre complex. It was reported to be in good condition overall as at 31 October 2016. The roof and dance floor are in need of repair due to water damage, however this can be repaired. The overall integrity of the building is excellent. Although there were major works done in the early 2000s these were done for functionality as a theatre, while retaining the authenticity of the building. The work carried out in the restoration was to best protect the significant fabric of the place with minimal disturbance, to ensure the culturally significant aspects of the place are respected, retained and preserved. = Modifications and dates = * 2003 Restoration of the theatre * 2007 Extension of backstage area * 2012 Addition of industrial kitchen wing.  Heritage listing  The Roxy Theatre and Peters Greek Cafe Complex is of state significance as a rare surviving example of an Inter-War Art Deco cinema with its distinctive street presence and intact, luxurious, interior detailing and layout in country NSW. Its significance is enhanced by the fact that the Inter-War theatre still operates as a theatre and entertainment venue today. The theatre and cafe complex demonstrate the importance of \\"cinema going\\" during the first half of the 20th century in NSW towns before the advent of television. It demonstrates and records the early introduction of American pop culture into country NSW through its function-the screening of early Hollywood movies, and also through its original theatrical design and its name, which were all modelled on the world's largest showcase movie palace of the time, the original Roxy Theatre in New York of 1927. The Roxy Theatre and Peter's Greek Cafe Complex is also of state heritage significance for its association with the story of Greek migration and settlement in country NSW in the first half of the 20th century. It is also of significance for its ability to demonstrate the architectural, technical and social aspects of cinema going during the 20th century. The Roxy Theatre and Peter's Greek Cafe complex is a rare and representative example of an Inter- War theatre designed in the Art Deco architectural style and retaining its internal and external design and layout elements. Being a rare building of this type and still being used for its original purpose makes it a rare demonstration of the social and entertainment culture that existed prior to the introduction of television. It is one of a handful of such cinemas that survive intact today and continues to operate as a theatre and as a significant focus of the community's social and cultural life. Internally, the Art Deco detailing of the ceiling and wall panels and proscenium create a sense of luxury and occasion for a visit to the cinema in the days prior to television. The significance of the building is enhanced by the fact that the layout of the complex (including the shops, the theatre and adjoining cafe) remains remarkably intact with only an extension to the back stage area and the addition of a kitchen being made with sensitivity to the heritage significance of the main building. Roxy Theatre and Peters Greek Cafe Complex was listed on the New South Wales State Heritage Register on 25 August 2017 having satisfied the following criteria. The place is important in demonstrating the course, or pattern, of cultural or natural history in New South Wales. The Roxy Theatre and Peter's Greek Cafe complex is of state heritage significance as it is a rare surviving example of an Inter-War Art Deco cinema in country NSW from the 1930s-the heyday of movie going. Opened in 1936, this theatre demonstrates the importance of \\"cinema going\\" during the first half of the 20th century in NSW towns before the advent of television. It also demonstrates and records the early introduction of American pop culture into country NSW by the early Hollywood movies shown for the first time in this cinema, by the building function and its original theatrical design and its name (which were all modelled on the world's largest showcase movie palace of the time, the original Roxy Theatre in New York of 1927). This early introduction of American pop culture in the form of Hollywood movies and picture theatres, provided a major new form of entertainment, communication and society to NSW communities, as well as having a significant influence on Australian tastes of the time in architecture, fashion and design generally, language, music and behaviour. The theatre is also historically important as it continues to be used as a cinema and community based theatre. The place has a strong or special association with a person, or group of persons, of importance of cultural or natural history of New South Wales's history. The Roxy Theatre and Peter's Greek Cafe complex may be of state heritage significance as it illustrates, through the story of Greek migrants who established the Roxy, the story of Greek immigration and settlement in country NSW and Queensland in the first half of the 20th century. This was a period when most Greeks owned, or were employed in, cafes and a considerable number owned and operated picture theatres. The Roxy evidences and marks significant points in the journey of Greek immigrants from Greece and in their subsequent \\"journey\\" towards becoming Australians. It is also a tangible reminder of the Greek cafes and cinemas which were a \\"Trojan Horse\\" for the Americanisation of the nation's eating and social-cultural habits from the very start of the 20th century when American food-catering ideas, technology and products influenced the development of cinema and popular music, and even architectural style, in NSW. The place is important in demonstrating aesthetic characteristics and/or a high degree of creative or technical achievement in New South Wales. The Roxy Theatre and Peter's Greek Cafe complex is of state heritage significance as a distinctive, landmark Inter-War building designed in the Art Deco style in country NSW. Its exterior facade is finely detailed with a stepped silhouette, pilasters and entablature and simple panelling to break up its cement-rendered wall surface. The pilasters feature stylised low relief decorative patterns. Other external details include the chrome framed shopfront windows and entranceways. Internally, the Art Deco detailing of the ceiling and wall panels and proscenium create a sense of luxury and occasion for a visit to the cinema in the days prior to television. The significance of the building is enhanced by the fact that the layout of the complex (including the shops, the theatre and adjoining cafe) remains remarkably intact with only an extension to the back stage area and the addition of a kitchen being made with sensitivity to the heritage significance of the main building. The place has strong or special association with a particular community or cultural group in New South Wales for social, cultural or spiritual reasons. The Roxy Theatre and Peter's Greek Cafe complex may be of state heritage significance for its special association with the Greek Australian Kytherians as it has become a place of pilgrimage for Greeks who grew up as \\"cafe kids\\" and were a part of the Greek immigration story in Australia. It is also locally significant for its part in the historic and contemporary community and social life, at once holding the memories and associations of those who grew up attending the cinema there and for those who are growing up now and taking advantage of the opportunities provided by the theatre including cinema going, school and community performances, weddings, reunions etc. The place has potential to yield information that will contribute to an understanding of the cultural or natural history of New South Wales. The Roxy Theatre and Cafe complex may be of state heritage significance for its complete and detailed demonstration of architectural, technical and social aspects of cinema going during the 20th century. The intactness of the place can also demonstrate aspects of the Greek immigration story in NSW through both the story of the establishment of the cinema and the artefacts and memorabilia on display in the museum established in the theatre complex. The place possesses uncommon, rare or endangered aspects of the cultural or natural history of New South Wales. The Roxy Theatre and Cafe complex may be of state heritage significance as a rare example of an Inter-War theatre designed in the Art Deco architectural style that retains its internal and external design and layout elements. Being a rare building of this type and still being used for its original purpose, makes the Roxy a rare demonstration of the social and entertainment culture that existed prior to the introduction of television. It is also rare as a purpose built cinema of its era that is still used as a cinema and community performance venue today. It is the only known theatre still operating in NSW with its accompanying cafe and shops still in place. While a number of NSW towns still have their cinema buildings, many of them have been gutted and reused as shops, motor mechanics premises or developed as apartment buildings. In 1951, a survey indicated that there were 351 cinemas operating in 289 country town in NSW. By 2003, the number of cinemas recognisable as such numbered 31. A desktop survey of cinemas undertaken as part of this heritage assessment indicates that, of these 31, only seven Inter-War cinemas in rural NSW towns retain their original format, interior/exterior architectural features and decorative schemes and still operate as theatres. The place is important in demonstrating the principal characteristics of a class of cultural or natural places/environments in New South Wales. The Roxy Theatre and Cafe complex may be of state heritage significance as a fine example of a cinema designed in the Inter-War Art Deco style in NSW. It is one of a handful of such cinemas that survive intact and continue to operate as a theatre and remain as a centre of the community's social and cultural life.

History  The Progress programme at the premiere of the film Unzertrennliche Freunde in the Leipzig Cinema Capitol on December 12, 1953. Progress was founded on 1 August 1950 as a German‚ÄìSoviet company. Like DEFA, Progress Film was a monopoly company, and its films were carefully vetted by the regime for their content. Progress took over this role in the early 1950s from Sovexport, a Soviet-controlled company which operated during the period following the Battle of Berlin in 1945 and the Allied Occupation of Germany. Rudolf Bernstein and Georgri Nikolayevich Nikolayev, later director of Soviet film production Lenfilm, were appointed German and Soviet directors. Progress was the only film distributor in the German Democratic Republic and produced around 12,000 films in nine decades. Almost half of them were feature films and documentaries by DEFA, the only film studio in the GDR: * 950 DEFA feature films and short feature films * 5,700 DEFA documentary films and newsreels * 2,500 GDR commissioned films (NVA, Ministry of the Interior of the GDR and others) * 820 DEFA animated films * 4,000 DEFA synchronizations (e.g., Eastern European film classics) * 40 German and European Arthouse films (feature, children's and documentary films) Actors such as Armin Mueller- Stahl, Manfred Krug, Corinna Harfouch and Ulrich M√ºhe and filmmakers like cinematographer Joris Ivens and directors such as Konrad Wolf, Heiner Carow and Frank Beyer began their careers in DEFA films.

For decades a singer of the Hoftheater in Berlin, she appeared in the first complete performance of Wagner's Der Ring des Nibelungen at the first Bayreuth Festival in 1876 as one of the Rhinemaidens.  Career  Born in Sondershausen, Lammert appeared as a soloist in a church performances already at age ten. After voice training at the conservatories of Coburg and Leipzig, she was engaged at the Hoftheater, the court theatre of her home town, making her debut in 1872, as Leonore in Beethoven's Fidelio. She was from 1873 until her retirement in 1896 a member of the Hoftheater in Berlin. She was known for roles in Wagner operas, such as Mary in Der fliegende Holl√§nder, Ortrud in Lohengrin and Magdalena in Die Meistersinger, but also appeared as Azucena in Verdi's Der Troubadour and Fides im Meyerbeer's Der Prophet. She took part in the premieres of Anton Rubinstein's Die Maccab√§er on 11 April 1875, and of Theobald Rehbaum's Turandot on 11 April 1888. Other roles included Gertrud in Marschner's Hans Heiling, Nancy in Flotow's Martha, Irmentraut in Lortzing's Der Waffenschmied, Margarethe in Boieldieu's Die wei√üe Dame, the Marquise in Donizetti's Die Regimentstochter, and Karin in Edmund Kretschmer's Die Volkunger. Stage machinery for Das Rheingold at the first Bayreuth Festival At the first Bayreuth Festival, from 13 to 17 August 1876, she appeared as Rosswei√üe and Flo√ühilde in the first complete performance of Der Ring des Nibelungen. The other two Rhinemaidens were Lilli Lehmann and her sister Marie Lehmann. Lilli Lehmann described in her memoirs Lammert as highly musical (\\"urmusikalisch\\"), and her voice as velvety (\\"sammetweich\\"). During the performance, the singers simulated swimming with the aid of machinery conceived by Wagner, which had presented some initial difficulties in the execution. After the opening scene was first tried, stage assistant Richard Fricke wrote in his diary that Wagner \\"thanked them with tears of joy\\". Lammert was married in 1878 to the Sanit√§tsrat Dr. Tamm, and also appeared with her married name, Minna Lammert- Tamm. She died in Berlin.

It was added to the Australian National Heritage List on 7 June 2008 and the New South Wales State Heritage Register on 12 November 2010.  History  In the half century following the arrival of the First Fleet in 1788, a pattern of relations developed between Aboriginal people and European settlers that lasted into the 1900s. While the British Colonial Office instructed Arthur Phillip, the first Governor, to treat the Aboriginal population with goodwill and kindness, competition for resources and land following the expansion of European settlement invariably resulted in frontier conflict. Frontier violence posed a problem for the British administration because Aboriginal people and settlers were legally British subjects with the same rights and protection. Lack of resources and pressure from settlers however, made it increasingly difficult for the Administration to ensure the application of the rule of law. The Myall Creek massacre in 1838, the subsequent court case and the hanging of seven settlers for the massacre of Aboriginal people, is pivotal in the development of the relationship between settlers and Aboriginal people. It is the first and last time that settlers were found guilty of, and hanged for, the killing of Aboriginal people on the frontier. It is the last time the Colonial Administration intervened to ensure the laws of the colony were applied equally to Aboriginal people and settlers involved in frontier killings. However, instead of setting a precedent that Aboriginal people could be protected under the law, Ryan (1980:20) states: the Myall Creek massacre and the ensuing cases had intensified the squatter's determination to have unfettered occupation of pastoral land. They were not prepared to wait while protectors rounded up the Aborigines, nor were they prepared to allow their stockkeepers to endure the full force of the law...for 1838 was the year that saw the final loss of control by government of pastoral expansion. ;Colonial Administration's Response to Frontier Conflict Aboriginal attacks on unarmed convicts were commonplace following the establishment of the settlement at Port Jackson in 1788. While some members of the Administration felt that the Aboriginal inhabitants of the area should be driven away and kept away by the judicious use of muskets, Governor Phillip attempted to establish friendly relations and trade.Clendinnen 2003:19-31, 55 As a result of this policy, Phillip did not respond aggressively to the spearing of convicts by Aboriginal people. However, following the spearing and death of one of his servants in 1790, he authorised a punitive expedition against the \\"Botany Bay\\" tribe. He ordered the expedition to bring back two Aboriginal men to be hanged and the heads of a further ten Aboriginal men but it returned empty handed.Clendinnen 2003:174-177 Phillip never ordered another punitive expedition. Phillip appears to have generally adopted a non-hostile approach to dealing with Aboriginal attacks. Conversely he ordered the flogging of settlers who took Aboriginal spears and nets or damaged Aboriginal canoes. Although Aboriginal witnesses to the floggings were horrified,Clendinnen 2003:99 Phillip used the floggings to demonstrate that settlers guilty of offences against Aboriginal people would be punished. In some cases he also provided compensation to Aboriginal people for their loss. However, following his departure in December 1792 all accommodation ended and the British Administration adopted a simpler solution: the unequal application of the law for settlers and Aboriginal people.Clendinnen 2003:217 With the expansion of European settlement into the Hawkesbury and Hunter regions, frontier conflict intensified. This conflict was the result of competition for land which settlers required for crops and the grazing of sheep and cattle. Aboriginal people relied upon the same land for food and water.Kidd 1997:14 The initial response by the Administration was to dispatch troops to police the frontier, but the expanding area of land to be covered made this an increasingly difficult task. A lawless frontier environment soon existed where it was impossible to control the conflict between settlers and Aboriginal people. In response to this challenge the Administration ordered settlers to defend themselves and ordered Aboriginal people to stay away from European habitation. There is no evidence that Aboriginal people understood and agreed with these orders to stay away from European settlement as the conflict on the frontier continued. Despite this, successive Governors in New South Wales adopted similar approaches to addressing frontier conflict. In 1796 Governor Hunter ordered settlers to \\"mutually afford their assistance to each other by assembling when ever any numerous bodies of natives are known to be lurking about the farms\\". By 1801 Governor King's orders were even more specific stating that the blacks were to \\"be driven back from settlers\\" habitations by firing at them'.Reynolds 1996:39 In 1816 Governor Macquarie issued a proclamation stating that \\"No Aboriginal person is to appear armed within a mile of any settlement and no more than six Aboriginal people are allowed to lurk or loiter near farms\\".(Australian Museum 2007). During the 1830s individual colonies around Australia started to develop distinctive approaches to dealing with the issue of frontier violence. All of these approaches focused on removing Aboriginal people from the areas settled by Europeans. In New South Wales the practice of sending troops to suppress Aboriginal violence, often aided by settlers continued.Milliss 1992:1-21 This was evident in the Liverpool Plains district (the north-west frontier) following its initial settlement by Europeans in the late 1820s. ;North-West Frontier in the 1820s and 1830s Settlers from the Hunter Valley and Mudgee, in need of more pasture for their rapidly increasing flocks of sheep and herds of cattle, began arriving on the Liverpool Plains in . At this time there were an estimated 12,000 Aboriginal people living in the district, mostly belonging to the Gamilaroi (also spelt Kamilaroi) language group but including other Aboriginal groups.(Connor.2002:103). The Gamilaroi people appear, from the very beginning, to have resisted European settlement. Surveyor William Gardner recorded how shortly after stations were formed on the Namoi River, local Aboriginal groups issued a formal challenge to the settlers to do battle. The stockmen however, refused to leave their barricaded hut. The war party responded by attacking the hut and attempted to remove the roof. The warriors were forced to retreat after numerous members of the party were killed by the sixteen heavily armed stockmen. The stockmen then followed the retreating party on horseback and \\"taught them they knew how to fight\\".Reece 1974:28-29 By 1837 settlers had pushed beyond the Peel and Namoi Rivers and taken up large tracts of land along the Gwydir or the \\"Big River\\" as it was then known. Local Gamilaroi groups resisted the alienation of their traditional lands almost immediately. The dispersed nature of the settlers stations enabled the Gamilaroi to easily isolate and attack stockmen and their livestock.Connor 2020:105 In April 1836 two stockmen working for the Hall Brothers, were killed while forming a new station. In September and November of the following year two hutkeepers and two shepherds from the Bowman and Cobb stations were killed.Reece 1974:29 Crown Land Commissioner Alexander Paterson reported back to Sydney in the second half of 1837 that stockmen on the Loder station, which was the westernmost station on the Namoi, were so afraid of raids by the Gamilaroi that they had abandoned their livestock to roam unattended in the bush.Connor 2002:105 Liverpool Plains settlers demanded military protection against Aboriginal attacks. In response to their demands, Lieutenant-Colonel Kenneth Snodgrass, Acting Governor of New South Wales sent a large Mounted Police party north to enquire into and repress the aggressions complained of. The Mounted Police party, led by Major Nunn and composed of around twenty troopers reached Liverpool Plains in January 1838. What occurred after they arrived remains unclear, but at Waterloo Creek, 50 kilometres southwest of what is now Moree, the Mounted Police encountered a large party of Aboriginal people camped alongside the Creek. In the ensuing melee a number of Aboriginal people were shot. The exact number of Aboriginal people killed in the melee is unknown but local squatters who visited site later, reported the number killed to be sixty or seventy. An eye witness to the encounter testified that forty to fifty may have been killed. Rev Threlkeld in his mission report for 1838 stated that the number may have been as high as two or three hundred.Connor 2002:110-111Reece 1974:33 According to R. H. W. Reece in his book \\"Aborigines and Colonists,\\" local tradition states that Nunn's party of Mounted Police was involved in at least one more large melee with local Aboriginal people before the party left the Plains. Major Nunn's Campaign (as it was known in the district) did not prevent further racial conflict. In March of that year two men working for Surveyor Finch were killed in the neighbouring district of New England, then in April a hutkeeper on the Gwydir was killed. In the following months stockmen from stations along the Gwydir River organised themselves into armed groups and scoured the country side in what is described by Reece as \\"a concerted campaign to get rid of all the Aborigines in the district.\\" According to Reece this still known in local tradition as \\"The Bushwhack\\" or \\"The Drive\\".Reece 1974: 34 The Myall Creek Massacre took place in June of that year, on Myall Creek Station near the Gwydir River. ;The Myall Creek Massacre The escalating conflict between settlers and Aboriginal people on the frontier was one of the issues confronting Governor Gipps on his arrival in the New South Wales colony in 1838. Governor Gipps and the Colonial Secretary Lord Glenelg agreed that an important measure to prevent frontier conflict was to impress Aboriginal people with \\"the conviction that the laws of the colony will be equally administered for their protection from wrong and injury as for that of European settlers\\".Rowley 1970:35Lord Glenelg to Gipps cited by Connor 2002: 113 The Myall Creek massacre provided Governor Gipps with an opportunity to demonstrate that the law could protect Aboriginal people through its equal application. When news of the incident was reported to him, Governor Gipps did not hesitate to order the perpetrators be brought to justice.Wannan 1962: 200 Once Governor Gipps was informed he gave instructions that Police Magistrate Day should proceed immediately to the scene of the tragedy with a party of mounted police to seek out the murderers.Wannan 1962:201 Day conducted a thorough investigation and apprehended eleven of twelve suspected Myall Creek murderers. The eleven men were arrested and tried for the murder of Daddy and an unknown Aboriginal(R v Kilmeister No. 1 - http://www.law.mq.edu.au) The twelve men responsible for the massacre included freed convicts and assigned convicts, led by John Fleming, the manager of the Mungie Bundie Station. The original party assembled at Bengari on a station owned by Archibald Bell before they set off and were joined by the remaining members somewhere along the Gwydir River.Elder 1988: 74-75 After spending the day unsuccessfully pursuing Aborigines the group came to the Myall Creek Station. They discovered approximately 30 Aborigines belonging to the Gamilaroi and Wirrayaraay peoples on the station, rounded them up and tied them together. When the station hand, George Anderson asked what they intended to do with the Aborigines he was told they were taking them over the back of the range to frighten them. A few minutes later the Gamilaroi and Wirrayaraay were led off and massacred. Two days later the men returned to burn the bodies.Elder 1988:78 The impact of the massacre on the Gamilaroi and Wirrayaraay peoples was devastating. As one of the descendants whose great-great-great-grandfather survived the massacre states 'We didn't want to talk about it because of how dreadful it was I remember when we used to drive past that place. It just had a feeling about it that I can't explain'.Australian Broadcasting Corporation 2001 The Myall Creek massacre was marked by the unusual circumstance that one of the station hands who did not participate in the massacre, George Anderson, informed the station manager, William Hobbs, who reported the incident to the local magistrate. The reports by Anderson and Hobbs were not without danger, as the inquiry of magistrate Edward Day noted \\"[I] took George Anderson with [me], believing that [his] life would be in danger if he remained at Myall Creek\\".Day as cited by Wannan 1962:203 In response to the charging of the eleven suspects settlers formed groups such as the \\"Black Association\\" to support the men charged with the murder. Papers such as the Sydney Herald protested against the trials.Barber 1993 Charging the perpetrators of the massacre also stimulated the activism of religious and humanitarian groups who called for the execution of the perpetrators.Rowley 1970:36-37 These views were promoted through papers such as the Sydney Monitor and the Australian. Upon being found not guilty, seven of the men were re-arrested and tried for the murder of an Aboriginal male named Charley.(R v Kilmeister No. 2 - http://www.law.mq.edu.au). The second trial resulted in a guilty verdict and all seven men were sentenced to death. Governor Gipps later wrote that none of the seven attempted to deny their crime, though all stated they thought it extremely hard that white men should be put to death for killing blacks.H.R.A Vol XIX:739 On 18 December 1838, after all legal objections were exhausted and the Executive Council rejected petitions for clemency, the sentences were carried out. John Plunkett, an Irish barrister, prosecuted in the two trials of the killers. Plunkett came to NSW in 1832 to take up the post of Solicitor-General. As a Catholic, he only became eligible for such an appointment in 1829 when the British Parliament removed most of the restrictions on members of that faith holding public office. In 1836 he became the colony's first Attorney-General but continued to carry out the duties of both positions. The colony was divided, often acrimoniously, between three groups - convicts, those who had been convicts but were now emancipated, and those who thought themselves superior because they had never been either. One of the most powerful sections of the community were the squatters, who had established large pastoral holdings in the north of the colony, one result of which was the complete disruption of local Aboriginal communities.Sexton, 2017, 19 When the trial of the stockmen commenced, they had expensive defence counsel paid for by the local landowners from the Myall Creek area. The workings of criminal law in 1838 meant there could only be one victim in relation to any particular trial for murder, no matter how many accused had been charged. This presented problems of identification for the prosecution, particularly because one witness saw the Aborigines being led away and a different witness saw their largely burnt bodies. Plunkett was the subject of considerable public criticism for initiating the prosecution and the first trial resulted in not guilty verdicts. But this was where the one-victim rule played into Plunkett's hands. He chose a different victim for a second trial of seven of the stockmen, who again made no statements on their own behalf. This time the verdict was guilty, and, after an appeal was dismissed, all seven were hanged, despite public petitions and violent editorials demanding that the sentences be commuted. It is something of an irony that Plunkett himself was opposed to capital punishment. ;Aftermath of the Trial The hanging of the seven stockmen in 1838 for their part in the Myall Creek massacre caused controversy throughout the colony. It led to heightened racial tensions and hardened attitudes towards Aboriginal people.Reece 1974:48 This was evident on the day of the execution when the Australian published a letter which said, \\"I look on the blacks as a set of monkies, and the earlier they are exterminated from the face of the earth the better. I would never consent to hang a white man for a black one\\" (The Australian, 18 December 1838). While this was not the first time settlers were hanged for murdering Aborigines (see R v Ridgway, Chip, Colthurst and Stanley 1826, R v Kirby & Thompson 1820) it was the first time that settlers were found guilty of, and hanged for, the killing of Aboriginal people on the frontier. It is also the last time the Colonial Administration intervened to ensure the laws of the colony were applied equally to Aboriginal people and settlers involved in frontier killings. Governor Gipps' public resolve to treat Aboriginal people equally never diminished, however the public response to the Myall Creek trial influenced his future decisions. The failure to re-try the remaining four men accused in the Myall Creek massacre and the continuing delays to the enquiry of Major Nunn's campaign highlight this. Governor Gipps indicates that one of the reasons for the delay into the enquiry was the settlers \\"very excited state in respect to the blacks\\" after the execution of seven men for their part in the Myall Creek massacre.H.R.A. Vil. XX:246 Governor Gipps also was concerned that any action taken against Major Nunn would result in the military quitting their positions, leaving the frontier severely weakened.H.R.A. Vol. XX:246 Despite the guilty verdicts and the hanging of seven men that followed the Myall Creek trials, frontier violence between settlers and Aboriginal people did not diminish. Although the police and Aboriginal protectors investigated the frequent reports of violence towards Aboriginal people, settlers were rarely arrested and when they were, juries generally found them innocent of any crime. On the rare occasion when a settler was convicted for the murder of Aboriginal person, their sentence would generally be reduced. ;Legacy and Reconciliation The Myall Creek massacre was a landmark event because retelling the story continued to remind Australians about the mistreatment of Aboriginal people during the period of frontier conflict. During the 1800s several popular poems were written about the massacre including \\"Incantation Scene\\", \\"Weird Sisters\\" and \\"The Aboriginal Mother\\", the latter written by poet Eliza Dunlop was subsequently set to music.Webby 1980:1-13 The events were also recounted in texts published in Australia and overseas.Harris 1852Heaton 1879Flanagan 1888;Chomley 1903Collier 1911 From 1920 to 1950 the Myall Creek massacre was less frequently discussed in texts although it did receive some attention.Elkin 1941Shaw 1954 In the early 1970s, the historian Charles Rowley described the Myall Creek massacre as one of Australia's horror stories that has \\"given us such as racist image overseas\\" and must be told if Australians are \\"to understand the real nature of the Aboriginal problem [and] the brutalizing forces that brought it into being\\".NSW Department of Child Welfare and Social Welfare 1971:9 It was around this time that stories of the Myall Creek massacre returned to prominence in texts on Australian history to illustrate the conflict between Indigenous people and settlers on the frontier.Beatty 1962Barnard 1962Ward 1969Wannan 1972Denholm 1978Murray 1984Bassett 1986Atkinson et al 1987Kociumbas 1992Woods 2002 The Myall Creek massacre was also included in specialised text on Indigenous history and frontier conflict to describe race relations in Australia and the way the Colonial Administration dealt with Indigenous issues.Rowley 1970Horton 1994Milliss 1992Windschuttle 2000Elder 2003Attwood et al 2003 In the 1990s the New South Wales Board of Education included the Myall Creek massacre in its \\"Discovering Democracy Unit\\" which formed part of the curriculum for civics and citizenship education. As well as playing an important role in educating people about Australian Indigenous history, the Myall Creek massacre also became part of Australia's reconciliation movement.Goodall 2002Johnson 2002 In 1998 the Uniting Church in Australia held a conference on reconciliation at Myall Creek, which lead to the establishment of a Myall Creek Memorial Committee.Myall Creek Memorial Committee 2007:19 This Committee is made up of descendants of the Aboriginal people who survived the Myall Creek massacre, concerned locals and participants of the conference. One of the aims of this Committee was to establish a memorial in recognition of the Myall Creek massacre. In June 2000, after several years of work, the Committee opened the Myall Creek Memorial \\"in an act of reconciliation and in acknowledgement of the truth of our shared history\\".Myall Creek Memorial Committee 2007:27 This memorial has brought together the descendants of the victims, survivors and perpetrators and each year a commemoration ceremony is held at the site. A Sydney Friends of Myall Creek has also been established to promote the significance of this site for all Australians. In recognition of the role that the memorial has played as a place of reconciliation, the Myall Creek memorial is a winner of the Australians for Native Title and Reconciliation's Judith Wright Reconciliation Prize.NSW Reconciliation Council 2003The Australian Frontier Wars 1788-1838 by John ConnorAborigines and Colonists by R. H. W. Reece) A memorial service was held for the 170th anniversary of the massacre in 2008. This was attended by Federal Minister for Heritage, The Hon. Peter Garrett who announced the inclusion of the site on the National Heritage List (Australia's Living Heritage 1(3), Summer 2008-9, 8-9). Each year on the June long weekend over 400 people from around Australia gather at the memorial to commemorate the massacre of 1838.(Warialda Standard, 8/6/2016)  Description  At the end of the walkway is the memorial set on a rise over looking the site of the massacre The Myall Creek massacre and memorial site is located on gently rolling slopes and small hills which have mostly been cleared and improved for grazing sheep and cattle. The area supports dry sclerophyll woodland species such as the White Box, Bimble Box, Red Gum, Scribbly Gum and various Ironbarks. The land is part of a Travelling Stock Route used by cattle to access the creek. Two basalt blocks mark the beginning of the memorial walkway which is a 600-metre winding path in red gravel that leads through woodland and grasses. At various stages along the walkway there are seven oval shaped granite boulders which contain plaques with etchings and words in English and Gamilaroi. These plaques tell the story of the Myall Creek massacre. At the end of the walkway the memorial is set on a rise overlooking the site of the massacre between five spreading gumtrees. The memorial rock is a 14 tonne granite boulder with a simple plaque surrounded by a circle of crushed white granite, edged in by stones from all around the state of New South Wales. Bronze plaque commemorating the massacre The Bronze Plaque on the memorial states: :In memory of the Wirrayaraay people who were murdered on the slopes of this ridge in an unprovoked but premeditated act in the late afternoon of 10 June 1838. Erected on 10 June 2000 by a group of Aboriginal and non-Aboriginal Australians in an act of reconciliation, and in acknowledgment of the truth of our shared history. We Remember them (Ngiyani winangay ganunga). The area is mainly woodland with the Myall Creek Memorial being constructed of fire resistant granite and metal alloys. The Myall Creek Memorial was opened in 2000. The memorial is managed by the Gwydir Shire Council and the Myall Creek Memorial Committee.  Heritage listing  Heritage boundaries The brutal massacre at Myall Creek of around 30 men, women and children of the Wirrayaraay and Gamilaroi peoples in June 1838, the subsequent court cases and the hanging of the seven settlers for their role in the massacre, was pivotal in the development of the relationship between settlers and Aboriginal people in NSW. It was the last attempt by the Colonial Administration to use the law to control frontier conflict between settlers and Aboriginal people. Instead of setting a precedent that Aboriginal people could be protected under the law, it hardened settlers' resolve to use whatever means were available to clear Aboriginal people from the land on the frontier. The massacre at Myall Creek is a relatively rare instance in NSW, where the massacre of Aboriginal people (as a result of frontier violence) is well documented, and broadly speaking the massacre is representative of the violent conflict that took place in frontier areas between Aboriginal people and settlers. The massacre at Myall Creek is also a landmark event because accounts of the massacre, written from the 1850s to the present, have continued to remind Australians about the mistreatment of Aboriginal people during the period of frontier conflict. The Myall Creek Massacre and Memorial Site is of high significance to the Wirrayaraay of Gamilaroi people, as the site of the brutal murder of their ancestors and for its ability to demonstrate the Wirrayaraay and Gamilaroi peoples experience of colonisation. The importance of site to the Wirrayaraay people is evidenced by their participation in the campaign to establish a memorial on the site of the massacre, and their continuing involvement in the management of site. Descendants of Aboriginal people who survived the massacre form part of the Myall Creek Memorial Committee, which co-manages the site. The Myall Creek Massacre and Memorial Site is important to the local community as a symbol of reconciliation and a place of education. District schools and representatives of all the Shires in the region participate in the annual service held at the site. The Myall Creek Memorial is also a place of reconciliation for the descendants of both Aboriginal and non-Aboriginal people involved in Myall Creek massacre. In recognition of the role that the memorial has played as a place of reconciliation, the Myall Creek Memorial was the winner of the Australians for Native Title and Reconciliation's Judith Wright Reconciliation Prize, in 2003. Myall Creek Massacre and Memorial Site was listed on the New South Wales State Heritage Register on 12 November 2010 having satisfied the following criteria. The place is important in demonstrating the course, or pattern, of cultural or natural history in New South Wales. The Myall Creek Massacre, the subsequent court cases and the hanging of seven settlers, played a pivotal role in the development of the relationship between settlers and Aboriginal people. In the half century following British settlement, the Colonial Administration stated on numerous occasions that Aboriginal people and settlers were equal before the law. However, juries regularly found settlers accused on killing Aboriginal people on the frontier not guilty. The Myall Creek massacre is important in the course of New South Wales' history as it was the last time the Colonial Administration intervened to ensure the laws of the colony were applied equally to Aboriginal people and settlers involved in frontier killings. The massacre at Myall Creek is also a landmark event because accounts of the massacre, written from the 1850s to the present, have continued to remind Australians about the mistreatment of Aboriginal people during the period of frontier conflict. The place has a strong or special association with a person, or group of persons, of importance of cultural or natural history of New South Wales's history. The Myall Creek Massacre and Memorial Site is associated with the brutal massacre in June 1838 of a group of men, women and children of the Wirrayaraay and Gamilaroi peoples by settlers. A group of around 30 Aboriginal people were camped peacefully on Myall Creek Station when twelve stockmen rode on to the station, rounded them up and tied them together, before leading them off to be massacred. The place has strong or special association with a particular community or cultural group in New South Wales for social, cultural or spiritual reasons. The Myall Creek Massacre and Memorial Site is of high significance to the Wirrayaraay of Gamilaroi people, as the site of the brutal murder of their ancestors and for its ability to demonstrate the Wirrayaraay and Gamilaroi peoples experience of colonisation. The importance of site to the Wirrayaraay people is evidenced by their participation in the campaign to establish a memorial on the site of the massacre, and their continuing involvement in the management of site. Descendants of Aboriginal people who survived the massacre form part of the Myall Creek Memorial Committee, which co-manages the site.

In recognition of the role that the memorial has played as a place of reconciliation, the Myall Creek Memorial was the winner of the Australians for Native Title and Reconciliation's Judith Wright Reconciliation Prize, in 2003. The place possesses uncommon, rare or endangered aspects of the cultural or natural history of New South Wales. The Myall Creek Massacre is a relatively rare instance in NSW where the massacre of Aboriginal people, as a result of frontier violence, is well documented. The substantial public record of the terrible events that took place at Myall Creek Station on the 10 June 1838 exists, largely because of the immediate reporting of the event, the investigation by officers of the law and the documentation of the event through the subsequent court cases. The place is important in demonstrating the principal characteristics of a class of cultural or natural places/environments in New South Wales. The expansion of pastoral frontiers in the Colony of New South Wales, was invariably accompanied by some degree of conflict between settlers and displaced Aboriginal peoples. During the years 1837 and 1846 the Colony experienced the worst racial clashes in its history. The massacre at Myall Creek is a well documented example of the mistreatment of Aboriginal people during this period.

A slipway is also part of the infrastructure, giving access to the dock at low tide, both once served by roads running through the Park Estate from the south. It was recorded as Fulton's Quay in 1830, the name of a previous owner of the Park Estate who may have built it prior to 1801. A fixed light was installed at Park Quay in 1869. History =The Lands of Park= William Park of that ilk lived during the reign of James IV (1473 ‚Äì 1513) and had no male heir, leaving the lands of Park to his three daughters. His eldest daughter inherited Park and she married Robert Cunningham of Auchenhervie. The couple had a single child, a daughter Janet, who married George Houston and the lands then passed to a Cunninghame of Craigends. In 1768 a Campbell of Bredalbane acquired Park from John Sommerville. The estate was considerably improved at this time and the mansion house was built. Humphrey Fulton of Hartfield amassed a considerable fortune through setting up silk manufacturing in Paisley and his son William became the owner of Park in Inchinnan in 1789. John King of Millbank acquired Park in 1801 and then it was owned by Mr W.T. Lithgow, owner of the famous shipbuilding firm by 1905. The family's main home was at Langbank and William died in 1908. The woods were cut down and Park House was demolished to make way for the housing estates that now occupy the grounds. =Park Quay= The Park Quay from the west. Roy's circa 1755 map shows Park House, but no quay is indicated. In Ainslie's map of 1800, a road is seen running to the river from Park House but no quay is shown; Thomson's map of 1826 shows the same details. The quay first appears on a Lizar's 1818 map lying on the Park Estate and accessed by a road running from the mansion house and the local roads with the estate's North Lodge controlling the road into the Park House grounds by 1857. The name 'Fulton's Quay' indicates that it was built for the private use of the Park Estate between 1789 and 1801 and no obvious use in relation to quarrying or mining is apparent, unlike the nearby Rashielee Quay which was rail connected to whinstone quarries in 1857. It may have continued in use until the 20th century. By the late 1930s the beacon and quay were no longer marked on maps and the road to Park House had been truncated. Description of the quay, dock and slipway The mud punt ship graveyard. Both the quay and associated slipway were once served by the aforementioned roads that ran to the slipway basin or dock and along the quay. The basin is 54 m long and 10 m wide, with a jetty built with small stones composing the eastern side and a ruinous wall formed of well dressed larger stone blocks forming its western side. Park Quay jetty is 70 m long and 16 m wide. The eastern jetty is ruinous towards its terminus and the eastern side facing the dock appears to have partially collapsed at some point. A basic repair appears to have been made with a row of wooden piles used to keep the loose stone in place. A slipway at its southern end once enabled access to the river basin at low tide levels. The OS map of Renfrewshire in 1864 shows a wide jetty with a flagstaff and a small building on the western side. It appears to have extended into the river as far as the low water mark, but the shoreline has altered considerably over the years due to dredging, building of training dikes, jetties, etc. Between 1864 and 1895 a dock or basin was built also extending into the Clyde towards the low water mark. The jetty is portrayed as if it was damaged by erosion, floods, etc and a repair effected using wooden piles that are still visible. The eastern jetty in 1857 had a possible crane and a partly curved and strengthened end. In the 1920s or 30s the jetty terminus appears to have been altered and given a straight sided profile. In 1905 the quay seems to still have been in use given that it's marked as such and a beacon stood near by on the upstream direction, possibly on the circular stone structure that once stood in that location. In 1939 the quay was not marked as disused, unlike the abandoned Rashielee Quay, and the repaired eastern dock wall is shown as a linear structure and the terminus of the jetty is linear. Rashielee Quarry and its quay stood near by and provided much of the whinstone used in the construction of quays, jetties, training walls, etc on this part of the Clyde. From the evidence of the 1895 OS map a circular pile of stones was located at the low tide level a short distance up river and as stated this may be the one erected in 1869, carrying the beacon shown as a navigation aid in the 1905 OS map. This structure is now just an irregular pile of stones. =The Park Quay Ship Graveyard= Lying on the River Clyde shoreline bordered by the Newshot Local Nature Reserve and downriver from the better known Newshot ship graveyard are a number of abandoned mud punts in varying states of preservation. Some remain in a linear arrangement, reflecting the position they were grounded in when towed to their final resting place after mud punts became redundant due to improved dredging techniques.

The site was designated a National Historic Site of Japan in 1967. Overview The kofun cluster is located on an isolated hill near the centre of the modern city of Sabae, and consists of 49 tumuli dating to the late Yayoi period through the early Kofun period. the area was originally designated a protected area in 1942; however, after a detailed survey was conducted in 1967, it was determined that the area under protection did not include all of the site, whereas conversely a large portion of the protected area was not necessary. The borders of the area were revised and the new boundaries became a National Historic Site in 1967, and form part of a city park with walking trails. A total of eleven tumuli were excavated in 1965 (No. 1-7, 9, 25, 31 and 32), of which No. 1, 3, 4, and 7 were square mounds, 8 to 12 meters on a side with a height of 1-2 meters, and were dated to the late Yayoi period. All of the tombs had the remnants of a wooden sarcophagus, with the exception of No.4, which had two. All of the tombs had grave goods, mostly pottery fragments, with the exception of No.1, which was completely bare. Tomb 3 had goods from the T≈çkai region and Kansai region of Japan, indicating long-distance trade even in ancient times. Tombs No. 5, 7, 9 and 25 were also square tombs, 8 to 14 meters on a side, but were dated from the early Kofun period, as indicated by the presence of fragments of swords and other weapons, and metal horse fittings found inside. Tomb No. 31 was a round tomb with diameter of 20 meters and height of 2 meters, and Tomb No. 32 was also a round tomb, but with diameter of 8 meters. Both were also dated to the early Kofun period, and contained many artefacts. The tomb does not appear in any historical records and the name of rank of the person buried within is unknown. It is one of many similar kofun which have been discovered in the area, which has been densely populated since the Yayoi and Kofun periods, and from its scale it must have been the tomb of a local chieftain or other person of importance.

It is named after the distinctive beehive burials first found on Jebel Hafit, a rocky mountain near Al Ain, bordering the Rub Al Khali desert. Hafit period tombs and remains have also been located across the UAE and Oman in sites such as Bidaa bint Saud, Jebel Al-Buhais and Buraimi.  Discoveries  An unrestored Hafit period beehive tomb at Jebel Hafeet in the region of Al-Ain, on the border with Oman. Most of the hundreds of tombs to be found at the Eastern foothills of the mountain have collapsed. The first find of Hafit era tombs is attributed to the Danish archaeologist PV Glob in 1959, and the first of many excavations of these took place a few years later. Finds at Jebel Hafit include the remains of some 317 circular stone tombs and settlements from the Hafit period, as well as wells and partially underground Falaj irrigation systems, as well as mud brick constructions intended for a range of defensive, domestic and economic purposes. The Al Ain Oasis, in particular, provides evidence of construction and water management enabling the early development of agriculture for five millennia, up until the present day. Pottery finds at Hafit period sites demonstrate trading links to Mesopotamia, contiguous to the Jemdat Nasr period (3100 - 2900 BC). Evidence of trading links with Mesopotamia are also found in the subsequent Umm Al Nar and Wadi Suq periods of UAE history. In the region of Al-Ain, near Mezyad Fort and Jebel Hafeet, the Jebel Hafeet Desert Park contains the original necropolis of Hafit Graves which led to the naming of this period in human history in the emirates.

She worked to reconstruct a lost manuscript on the history of Tahiti written by her grandfather, English missionary John Muggridge Orsmond, by using his original notes. Most of her writings were published posthumously by the Bernice Pauahi Bishop Museum as the book Ancient Tahiti.  Early years and education  Henry was born on 24 January or 27 January 1847, on Tahiti, as the fourth child and eldest daughter of Isaac S. Henry and Eliza Orsmond Henry. Her paternal grandparents were William Henry and Sarah Maebens Henry while her maternal grandparents were John Muggridge Orsmond and Isabella Nelson Orsmond. Her two grandfathers were early English Protestant missionaries to Tahiti. William Henry had been part of the first contingent of the London Missionary Society to arrive on the ship Duff in 1797. Raised on Tahiti, she was educated at the missionary school run by William Howe and his wife in Papeete. She became fluent in French, English and Tahitian. Career Becoming a school teacher, she taught French and English at the Viennot School in Papeete for twenty years. From 1890 to 1906, Henry also taught in the Royal School and Kaahumanu School in Honolulu, Hawaii. Henry's maternal grandfather Orsmond had collected significant amounts of oral histories, genealogy, myths, folklore and traditional knowledge such as astronomy and navigation while living in Tahiti between 1817 and his death in 1856. In 1848, he had presented a manuscript about the history of Tahiti to French colonial official Charles Fran√ßois Lavaud, but it was lost before it could be published in Paris. During her lifetime, Henry reconstructed this lost manuscript by transcribing the original notes he left behind. Henry collected further similar material, translated and notated the material and wrote articles that were published by journals such as the Journal of the Polynesian Society. Henry died on 23 January 1915, in Paea, Papeete, Tahiti, at the age of 67 years old. Her manuscript was posthumously published as Ancient Tahiti by the Bernice Pauahi Bishop Museum in 1928. Bertrand Jaunez translated it into French in 1951 under the title Tahiti aux temps anciens. In 1995, Dennis Kawaharada re-printed some of Henry's stories alongside others in Voyaging chiefs of Havai ªi.

It was listed on the National Register of Historic Places in 1984. As of 2018, it was used as offices for a law firm. History William Clark Brown was born in McHenry County, Illinois in 1848, and moved to Lansing in 1876 to enter the lumber business. He formed a partnership with William B. Stone and George W. Stanton in 1880, manufacturing lumber and woodwork under the name W.B. Stone & Co. Brown ran the company's yard in North Lansing. In 1883, Brown purchased a lot for his house, selling half to Stone. Brown re-purchased Stone's half in 1890, and engaged Lansing architect Darius B. Moon to design a house. Construction began in 1890, and likely lasted through 1894 or 1895, because of an illness Brown suffered. Brown lived in this house until his death in 1909. In 1912, his wife Ella Brown sold the house to Lawrence and Julia A. Price. Price was born in 1843 in County Tipperary, Ireland and emigrated to the United States with his family in 1849, settling in Lewiston, New York. Price served in the Civil War, then moved to Michigan to farm in 1866. In 1880 he opened a grocery in Flint, Michigan, then moved to Lansing in 1883. He purchased a lumber yard in about 1888, and went on to head other companies in the area, including Price & Smith (a North Lansing hardware stone), the Lansing Brewing Company, the Auto Body Works (manufacturer of automobile bodies), of the Hildreth Motor & Pump Company, and the Peerless Motor Company. Price lived in the house until his death in 1917; after his death he willed nearly $100,000 to the Sisters of Mercy to found the St. Lawrence Hospital (now part of the Sparrow Health System). His wife Julia lived in the house until her death in 1931, when she bequeathed the house to St. Lawrence. The hospital sold it in 1935, and from 1938 to 1981 it was used as the Lavey Funeral Home. In 1982, the Michigan State Podiatry Association purchased the building, and rehabilitated it in 1983. As of 2018, it was used as offices for a law firm. Description The Brown-Price House is a large two-and-one-half-story brick Queen Anne structure. It is generally L-shaped, with a pyramid-roof, square tower in the angle of the L. It sits on a foundation of rock-face, brown sandstone, topped by a plain water table. The exterior is trimmed with sandstone, including window sills and lintels and other decorative elements. Additional trim of wood includes paneled bargeboards and shingling, and other decorations in the gables, and a paired-bracket cornice in the tower. The main entrance was originally located near the tower, but has been moved to a porch on the northeast section.

It is endemic to the seas off southern Australia. Description Arripis truttacea has a streamlined, moderately deep, slightly elongate body which is a little compressed with a relatively narrow caudal peduncle and a moderately small head. The eyes are quite small with an obvious growth of transparent adipose tissue on the anterior and posterior edges of the eye on larger fish. There is a series of fine serrations along the lower edge of the preorbital bone but these largely disappear in larger fish. The mouth is moderate in size and is oblique, its maxillae reaches a level below the centre of eyes. There is a narrow band of small pointed teeth in each jaw. The body, except for the lower jaw, snout and area above the eyes is covered with moderately small, very finely ctenoid and larger specimens feel smooth to the touch. The lateral line is almost straight. There is a long dorsal fin which has a slight notch separating the spiny and soft-rayed parts of the fin and the spiny part is markedly higher than the soft-rayed part. It has a small anal fin which is about half the length of the soft part of the dorsal fin. It has a deeply forked tail. The adults have a greyish green to steely blue back and normally have yellow to slate grey spots and they are silvery white on the underparts. The pectoral fin is pale yellowish and the other fins are translucent. The juveniles are similar to the adults but have more numerous spots and have dark margins to the fins. The spiny part of the dorsal fin contains 9 spines and 15-19 soft rays while the anal fin has 3 spines and 9 - 10 soft rays. The maximum standard length of although the more usual length is and the maximum published weight is . The most consistent difference between this species and Arripis trutta is the gill raker count, A. truttacea has 25-31 gill rakers and A trutta has 33-40. Distribution Arripis truttacea is endemic to the coastal waters of southern Australia where it is found from Lakes Entrance in Victoria to Kalbarri in Western Australia, although it is rare north of Lancelin in Western Australia. Habitat and biology Arripis truttacea adults gather in large schools along exposed beaches and rocky reefs while the juveniles use shallow bays and estuaries for nursery areas, the juvenils are frequently recorded in beds of Posidonia sea grass and in creeks lined with mangroves of the genus Avicennia. The schools of adults may also be found in estuaries and in deeper offshore waters. This is a carnivorous species which preys largely on small pelagic, schooling fish, known as baitfish. In turn, it is preyed on by seals, dolphins and sharks. The Western Australian salmon arrive off south western Australia from March onwards to spawn, mainly congregating in the waters between lying between Cape Leeuwin and Busselton in late autumn and early winter. Their arrival coincides with the peak of the strength of the eastward flowing Leeuwin Current and associated easterly winds. These then carry the newly hatched larval fish southeastwards. The larvae settle all along the southern coast of Australia but the majority are transported to the waters off Victoria and Tasmania. They mature in the nursery grounds which are situated between South Australia and Tasmania for a period of three to four years before migrating west to Western Australia, occurring in schools in the vicinity of Hopetoun and Esperance. Once the run of spawning is over, in mid-winter, the adults move back to the south-eastern Western Australian waters. Fisheries Arripis truttacea is an important species for commercial fisheries off the south coast of Western Australia where it has been a quarry for beach seiners since 1940. The fisheries is controlled by the South Coast Salmon Managed Fishery and South West Coast Salmon Managed Fishery and these bodies issue licences to commercial fisheries, in 2019 a total of 24 licences were issued by these bodies. The catch is considered to be sustainable, The Western Australian salmon has a reputation as a good fighter and is a popular quarry for recreation fishermen, normally from rocky coasts or beaches but also from boats. There are bag limits in place and licences are required to catch them from powered boats for anglers. The flesh of A. truttacea is considered to have a strong flavour, to be a little oily, coarse and soft which means that it is not held in high esteem as a food fish so most of the commercial landings go to canning. Taxonomy and etymology Arripis truttacea was first formally described as Centropristis truttaceus in 1829 by George Cuvier with the type locality being given as Port Western, Victoria. The specific name is given by some authorities as truttaceus but since this species was placed in the genus Arripis then the feminine form should be used as Arripis is feminine. Although the common name calls it a \\"salmon\\" it is unrelated to the true salmons of the family Salmonidae and it is one of four species in the genus Arripis from the monogeneric family Arripidae, a group of perciform fishes endemic to Australian and New Zealand. Other colloquial names for this species include bay trout, blackback, buck salmon, cockie salmon, colonial salmon, jack salmon, jacky, kahawais, lumpy, ocean trout, poundies, salmon trout, Southern Australian salmon and trout.

Gisela was attacked by her husband's political opponents and implicated in controversies involving her husband. Financial problems allegedly affected their marriage after Gisela bought a watch worth P2.5 million, which is said to have angered Ni√±o. Death of Gisela On June 6, 2017, Captain-Mayor Gisela Zambrano Bendong-Boniel and her best friend, Angela Celeste Gamalinda-Leyson and Angela's 17-year-old son Pete Ynaque Gamalinda-Leyson were persuaded by the staff of the Captain-Mayor of Bien Unido, Bohol Wilson Hoylar, her admin staff and her Executive Secretary Brian Sayson to stay overnight at the resort of Bien Unido. They said the Mayor needed to sign some important documents which were not part of her itinerary. Angela was urged not to and reminded her of her 7:00 P.M. appointment in Cebu. Her plan was to comply with signing the required documents for her to file the annulment case, and at the same time to resign from her post as the Mayor of Bien Unido, Bohol. On June 7, 2017, at around 2:00AM, 6 to 8 men entered their room. The men duct taped Angela around her face and she was tasered on the lower portion of her ears. Angela overheard the Captain-Mayor talking to her husband, recognized by his nickname \\"In-In\\". She pleaded for him to spare her best friend and told him that Angela's son was in the other room while a gun was pointed to her forehead. According to the story, Angela passed out, not knowing that the Captain-Mayor was already taken out from the room. A few hours later two men woke Angela and asked her to stand up as she and her 17 year old son were taken to Tubigon, traveling via High-speed craft from Tubigon to Cebu. Meanwhile, Captain-Mayor Gisela's body was wrapped with a blanket and brought to a pump boat. At around 4:00 AM, Ni√±o allegedly shot her, they put a fishnet around her body, tied a rock weighing 30 kilos to it and threw her body into the sea. During the interrogation, Ni√±o Rey said it was his cousin, Riolito \\"Etad\\" Boniel who shot his wife, but Riolito and driver Randel Lupas alleged that it was Ni√±o who shot his wife. =Retrieval of Boniel's body= Search and retrieval operations started on June 9. Divers scoured the Caubian at but they couldn't find Gisela's body. The deadline was intended to be 15 days. After days of searching, the retrieval operation ended but Gisela's family appealed to the authorities that they could resume. On July 15, 2017, the search and retrieval operation ended permanently as they could not find Gisela's body. On July 1, 2017, A woman's body was found in the waters of Tabuelan and was brought to Escalante, Negros Occidental. There was speculation that this could be Gisela's body. The body was later ruled out to be that of Boniel and was identified as the body of a 64 year old woman who is a resident from Calatrava, Negros Occidental. =Memorial= Although Gisela's body was not found, her family had a memorial on the sea on July 1, 2017 in Caubian Island. In November 2017, they had an All Souls Day on the sea. Trial Ni√±o Rey pleaded not guilty for kidnapping, serious illegal detention and physical injuries. On January 11, 2018, Ni√±o was brought to Cebu jail. Due to his poor health condition, he was treated in Cebu Provincial Detention and Rehabilitation Center. On March 22, 2018, Justice Secretary Vitaliano Aguirre II reversed the order, but on March 28, due to backlash Aguirre revived the order. On May 28, Ni√±o Rey's pre-trial for kidnapping and serious illegal detention was reset to September 5. On June 14, 2018, Ni√±o Rey Boniel resigned as a Bohol Board Member, and his trial was set for September 7. On September 7, Ni√±o Rey did not attend his trial due to his \\"poor health condition\\". The Bendong family, through their lawyer Amando Virgil Ligutan, released a statement alleging that Ni√±o Rey's reason to be intentionally absent was because of his unpreparedness to attend the hearing.

It is being developed by a consortium known as \\"Team Tempest,\\" consisting of the UK Ministry of Defence, BAE Systems, Rolls- Royce, Leonardo S.p.A. and MBDA, and is intended to enter service from 2035 replacing the Eurofighter Typhoon aircraft in service with the RAF and AMI. Two billion pounds will be spent by the British government on the project by 2025. Development The Tempest was announced by the British Defence Secretary Gavin Williamson on 16 July 2018 at the Farnborough Airshow as part of the Combat Air Strategy. It will be a sixth-generation jet fighter incorporating several new technologies, including stealth, optional manning, swarming drones, directed-energy weapons and hypersonic weapons. The RAF had a similarly named fighter in the Second World War which also followed a Typhoon. On 19 July 2019, Sweden and the United Kingdom signed a memorandum of understanding to explore ways of jointly developing sixth-generation air combat technologies. Italy announced its involvement in Project Tempest on 10 September 2019, during DSEI 2019. The Statement of Intent was signed between the UK participant bodies and Italian participant companies (Leonardo Italy, Elettronica, Avio Aero and MBDA Italy). At the Farnborough Airshow (FIA Connect) in July 2020, Defence Secretary Ben Wallace announced seven new companies were joining the Team Tempest consortium: GEUK, GKN, Collins Aerospace, Martin Baker, QinetiQ, Bombardier and Thales UK, along with UK universities and SMEs. Together the companies will develop more than 60 technology prototypes and demonstration activities. So far the program has employed 1,800 and is expected to increase to 2,500 by 2021. Design A mock-up of the Tempest in 2019 Tempest will be able to fly unmanned, and use swarming technology to control drones. It will incorporate artificial intelligence deep learning and possess directed-energy weapons.UK military aircraft technology BAE Systems Another piece of technology being designed into Tempest is so-called Cooperative Engagement Capability, the ability to cooperate on the battlefield, sharing sensor data and messages to coordinate attack or defence.

Although the genus was originally erected in 1878 (then with the name Hexomma), it was merged into the genus Sicarius in the 1890s, and remained unused until revived in 2017, when it was discovered that the African species then placed in Sicarius were distinct. The English name six-eyed sand spiders is used for members of the genus, particularly Hexophthalma hahni. Species in the genus have necrotic (dermonecrotic) venom, and can potentially cause serious or even life-threatening wounds. Taxonomy The genus was first created in 1878 by Friedrich Karsch as Hexomma, with the sole species Hexomma hahni. By 1879, though, Karsch had realized that this name had already been used in 1877 for a species of harvestman, so he published the replacement name Hexophthalma. In 1893, Eug√®ne Simon transferred Hexophthalma hahni to the genus Sicarius, and Hexophthalma fell out of use, until a phylogenetic study in 2017 showed that the African species of Sicarius, including Sicarius hahni, were distinct, and revived the genus Hexophthalma for them. Hexophthalma is one of three genera in the family Sicariidae, . It is placed in the same subfamily, Sicariinae, as Sicarius: =Species= Two new species were added to the genus in 2018, and one previously accepted species, H. testacea, was synonymized with H. hahnii. The number of species is expected to increase with further study. H. spatulata differs in a number of respects from other species in the genus, which thus may not be monophyletic. , the World Spider Catalog accepted these extant species: *Hexophthalma albospinosa (Purcell, 1908) ‚Äì Namibia, South Africa *Hexophthalma binfordae Lotz, 2018 ‚Äì Namibia *Hexophthalma damarensis (Lawrence, 1928) ‚Äì Namibia *Hexophthalma dolichocephala (Lawrence, 1928) ‚Äì Namibia *Hexophthalma goanikontesensis Lotz, 2018 ‚Äì Namibia *Hexophthalma hahni (Karsch, 1878) (type species) ‚Äì Namibia, South Africa *Hexophthalma leroyi Lotz, 2018 ‚Äì South Africa *Hexophthalma spatulata (Pocock, 1900) ‚Äì South Africa Venom Species of Hexophthalma produce venom that can have necrotic (dermonecrotic) effects, capable of causing serious or even life- threatening wounds, particularly if the wound becomes infected or the venom spreads in the body. The necrotic effects are caused by a family of proteins related to sphingomyelinase D, present in the venom of all sicariid spiders. In this respect, the genus resembles Loxosceles, the recluse spiders.

The supercapacitor batteries are visible on the roof of each end car. Acumulador de Carga R√°pida (ACR) () is a battery electric tram system marketed by Construcciones y Auxiliar de Ferrocarriles (CAF) of Spain. Trams equipped with ACR are fast-charged while at stops; elsewhere they require no overhead line, which is desirable for reasons of safety, reliability, cost, and aesthetics. It also allows regenerative braking where direct current electrification systems cannot return (much) energy to the grid.  Operation  ACR-equipped trams are powered between stops by discharging a rooftop supercapacitor battery, weighing around , which gives a range of around . The battery is partially recharged between stops by regenerative braking; at stops, it is completely recharged in around thirty seconds by current drawn via pantograph from a short section of overhead line.  Marketing  CAF offers ACR as an option on its Urbos 3 tram; for retrofitting on trams built by CAF or other manufacturers; and for standard gauge and metre gauge tram systems. ACR‚Äôs most direct competitor is the ground-level power supply (APS) marketed by Alstom; CAF differentiates ACR against APS through its support of regenerative braking. CAF claims that ACR could be useful in rapid transit systems for the same reason.  Installations  Since Seville‚Äôs MetroCentro tramway opened in 2007, sections of its overhead line around the Seville Cathedral had been dismantled annually to allow Holy Week processions to pass safely. ACR‚Äôs first commercial installation was aboard Urbos trams supplied to MetroCentro in 2011, allowing the permanent removal of overhead lines around the cathedral. Line 1 of the Tranv√≠a de Zaragoza has also used ACR since its second construction phase was completed in 2013. The use of ACR avoided the installation of overhead lines in the city‚Äôs historic centre.

In 1575, Cardinal Allen wrote that there were sufficient Catholics in Winchester to constitute the only'district' in south England. Mass was said in My Lady West's House in Fishmonger Street between 1579 and 1583. The building is now the Royal Hotel. Later the house was owned by Roger Corham, he built a residence for a priest called St Peter's House. Above the ground floor of the residence was a chapel.

E. Dunville (29 July 1867 ‚Äì 21 March 1924) was a leading English music hall comedian, described by Charlie Chaplin as \\"an excellent funny man\\". Life and career Dunville was born Thomas Edward Wallen at 32 New Street, Coventry, England on 29 July 1867. He was educated at Bablake School, and worked briefly for Rudge-Whitworth. He took his stage name from the whisky firm Dunville & Co. Having established himself in the northern music halls, Dunville took his act to London in 1890, performing first at the Middlesex Music Hall in Drury Lane. He was billed as an \\"eccentric comedian and contortionist\\". His appearance accounted for the \\"eccentric\\" part: he had a high forehead, and wore a black wig with a wide parting on the left; he wore a loose black jacket with large buttons, tight black trousers, and large boots. A disabled arm contributed to the \\"contortionist\\" part: the arm would jerk and swing with a life of its own as he performed an eccentric dance. Dunville's first wife, Fanny Warriss, attempted, with Dunville's support, a singing career on the music hall stage under the name Millie Lindon. Dunville's autobiography, The Autobiography of an Eccentric Comedian, was published by Everett & Co. in 1912. Death Remaining successful for more than thirty years, Dunville gave his last performance at the Grand Theatre, Clapham on 20 March 1924. The following day he disappeared, and on 22 March 1924 his body was found in the River Thames at Caversham Lock near Reading. Dunville had suffered with depression for several years, and he left his (second) wife, Dora, a suicide note including the words \\"I feel I cannot bear it any longer.\\" He is buried near Bridport in Dorset, in a grave marked with a white cross bearing the words \\"Jesus Wept\\". Recordings Dunville recorded five phonograph cylinders: * \\"Enquire Within\\" (Edison cylinder 13023) * \\"Nine Gallant Highlanders\\" (Edison cylinder 13024) * \\"Scoot\\" (Edison cylinder 13025) * \\"The Volunteer Fireman\\" (Edison cylinder 13036) * \\"The Three Stages of Women\\" (Edison cylinder 13037) Made on the earliest commercial medium for recording and reproducing sound, the recordings may have disintegrated: > \\"There is now a very real danger that T.E.

Wodehouse refers to Dunville in his 1909 comic novel The Swoop! (Part Two, Chapter Four). Dunville created a style of movement called \\"leg mania\\", which influenced later comic performers including Max Wall and Billy Dainty.

She married Pierce A'Court, (1677-1725); her grandson, William Ashe A'Court, (c.1747-1817), inherited the Heytesbury estate. In 1710, Edward married Frances Luttrell; they had no children. Career Viscount 'Turnip' Townshend, Ashe's political patron He graduated from Wadham College, Oxford on 7 April 1690, and in the 1695 election, was nominated for Heytesbury. His grandfather, Edward, was a wealthy London merchant, who purchased the Heytesbury estate in 1641. The borough returned two MPs, and an Ashe family member, or connection, occupied these continuously from 1640 to 1770. with only 26 voters, only one election from 1690 to 1754 was contested. Most of Wiltshire supported Parliament in the First English Civil War, while his father was a religious Independent. The Ashes were thus supporters of the 1688 Glorious Revolution, and reliable Whig voters. In 1696, Ashe voted for the execution of Jacobite plotter, Sir John Fenwick. The Ashes were a large family; in the early 1700s, Edward and another seven direct relatives were MPs. He was also connected by marriage to Viscount 'Turnip' Townshend, Whig Secretary of State for the North, 1714 to 1717. Although out manoeuvred by Walpole for leadership of the party, he and his supporters remained an important faction. As a result, Ashe held a number of government posts; he was Storekeeper of the Ordnance from 1710 until 1712, when he was removed by the 1713 Tory government. Restored by the Whigs as Clerk of the Ordnance in 1714, he lost office again when Townshend was defeated by his Whig rivals in 1718. Eventually, he was appointed to the Board of Trade, which he retained until 1746, although he played very little part in its activities. He resigned his offices in 1746, on grounds of ill=health, and died 22 May, 1748; he was buried at St Peter and St Paul, Heytesbury.

The film tells the story of Johanna Morrigan, an aspiring music journalist in 1990s Wolverhampton. It stars Beanie Feldstein, Paddy Considine, Sarah Solemani, Alfie Allen, Frank Dillane, Laurie Kynaston, Arinz√© Kene, Tadhg Murphy, Ziggy Heath, Bobby Schofield, Chris O'Dowd, Joanna Scanlan and Emma Thompson. How to Build a Girl had its world premiere at the Toronto International Film Festival on 7 September 2019 and won the FIPRESCI Special Presentations award. The film was released in the United States on 8 May 2020 by IFC Films and in the United Kingdom on 24 July 2020 by Lionsgate. Plot In the 1990s, 16-year-old Johanna Morrigan lives on a council estate in Wolverhampton with her aspiring rock star father Pat, exhausted mother Angie, brothers Krissi, Lupin and two infant twins. Johanna dreams of escaping her life to become a writer, and finds comfort in speaking with the portraits of her idols covering her bedroom wall. A poem she wrote is selected for a televised competition, but she is overcome with nerves and humiliates herself on national television. After inadvertently revealing that her family is illegally breeding Border Collies, resulting in her father losing his disability benefits, Johanna is determined to earn money for the family. Krissi refers her to D&ME;, a London music paper seeking a rock critic, and Johanna submits a review of the Annie soundtrack. She is invited to interview at the D&ME; offices, but arrives to learn the staff assumed her submission was a joke. Undeterred, she convinces them to give her a chance, and is assigned to cover the Manic Street Preachers in Birmingham. Eager to reinvent herself, Johanna adopts a new style, bright red hair, and the pen name \\"Dolly Wilde\\". She attends her first rock show and falls in love with the music, immersing herself in the local scene. D&ME; agrees to send her to Dublin to interview musician John Kite, who is instantly smitten with her bubbly personality. She spends the day with John, who brings her onstage with him. Afterward, they open up to one another about their lives, and Johanna finds herself enamored with him. Returning home, she writes a glowing feature on John, which her editor dismisses as the work of a teenage girl with a crush, and she is fired. Realising that negative criticism is the path to success, Johanna begins writing deliberately cruel reviews as Dolly, and is rehired at D&ME.; Now a scathing but popular critic, she is able to support her family with her writing income. She becomes sexually active, forcing Krissi to listen as she recounts her sexual exploits. Pat, still hoping to achieve fame with his band Mayonnaise, gives his single to Johanna to promote. She brings it to a D&ME; gathering where it is derided by the others, who force her to skeet shoot the record. At a music industry event, Johanna receives an award for \\"Arsehole of the Year\\", and runs into John. She drunkenly confesses her feelings for him and tries to kiss him, but he kindly rejects her advances. The next morning, she writes a piece about his life, including deeply personal details he told her in confidence. She quits school, leading her parents and Krissi to confront her over her increasingly delinquent behaviour, but she cruelly reminds them that her money is supporting the family. Johanna goes to a party with her coworkers, where she accepts a full-time position at D&ME;, but overhears them badmouthing her. Unleashing a tirade against their smugness and negativity, she quits and returns home to find John has called about her article, ending their friendship. Distraught, Johanna drinks and cuts her wrist with a drawing compass, but is knocked unconscious when her \\"Arsehole\\" award falls on her head. Recovering at the hospital, she reconciles with her family. To make amends, Johanna tries to apologise to every musician she criticised. She writes a piece on self-harm, and is hired by The Face magazine to write her own column, \\"Building a Girl\\". Finding John, Johanna apologises for her article, and shows him her original writing about him. She also gives him her newly cut-off hair as a token of apology. John forgives her, and says that while they may not be in a relationship anytime soon, he is happy to be her friend. Breaking the fourth wall, Johanna tells the audience that a girl can always reinvent herself for the better.

It is signed bottom left \\"G. Courbet\\". Description In the centre three young women, modelled by Courbet's three sisters Zo√©, Z√©lie and Juliette, offer a barefoot peasant girl something to eat. One of the three holds an umbrella against the sun. A dog stands behind the trio, whilst to the right two cows graze in a hilly landscape with rocky outcrops and a sunny blue sky. The landscape draws on real locations near Ornans, Courbet's native area, and were re-used by him in other landscapes with and without human figures. Young Ladies of the Village, 1851, Leeds Art Gallery In the preparatory sketch for Young Ladies (1851, Leeds Art Gallery), the same figures are placed further back within a composition more dominated by vegetation and the landscape than the final work Gustave Courbet, catalogue de l'exposition de 1977, Paris, RMN, pp.114-115.. The artist later redesigned the composition for an 1862 etching published by Alfred Cadart and Jules Luquet with different use of perspective Janine Bailly-Herzberg, Dictionnaire de l'estampe en France (1830-1950), Paris, Flammarion, 1986, . The same artist had previously painted the three sisters in his Three Sisters, the Stories of Grandmother Salvan (1846-1847, Curtis Galleries, Minneapolis). History Courbet first exhibited the work at the Paris Salon in April 1852 entitled The Village Maids give alms to a cowherd in a valley near Ornans - this was the first time in thirty years he had first exhibited a work there. It was immediately bought by the duc de Morny despite a public and press polemic against the work - for example, the art critic Th√©ophile Gautier expressesd reservations and felt the canvas was under-finishedLa Presse, 11 May 1852., whilst Gustave Planche, Eug√®ne Loudun and Louis √ânault felt it flouted the rules of perspective in the smallness of the figures relative to the cows - they also held the portrayal of the young women to be \\"rather ugly\\" and \\"incongruously diminished\\". The painting was displayed again in the 1855 Exposition universelle, provoking yet more criticism, this time against \\"this representation of provincial women dressed in Parisian fashion\\" provoking discomfort in its viewers. The painting provoked as much or even more discussion about Courbet as his Burial at Ornans and according to Michael Fried was one of his \\"breakthrough canvases\\" as part of a deliberate strategy to arouse scandal Michael Fried, Le R√©alisme de Courbet, Paris, Gallimard-NRF Essais, 1993 (online).. The poor reception of the work is explained by the social and historical context of the late Second French Republic - the rural electorate helped bring Louis-Napol√©on Bonaparte to power as emperor and to keep him in power, yet the painting showed the Franche-Comt√©, a strongly republican area, forcing rich Parisians to face up to the harsh realities of the countryside - rather than showing an idealised, tranquil and pacified countryside, it showed a potential enemy of middle-class city-dwellers, enriched by the industrial revolution and about to take part in the 1848 Revolution. Some saw the painting as the start of Courbet's political engagement, which took root both in his home-town and in his painting of the class struggle, as embodied in the tense eye contact between the women's lapdog (representing the arrogant middle class) and the young calves (symbolic of the peasant world about to erupt into rebellion) Dominique Massonnaud, ¬´ Le D√©sarroi critique : les affirmations pol√©miques comme n√©gation de l'art ¬ª, in Figures de la N√©gation, Textuel, n¬∞29, 1995, p. 58.. Others see it as simply reusing an old philosophical archetype of generously giving charity to the poor, albeit in a balanced and distanced manner far from the Roman Catholic aesthetic rules at the forefront of other painters' work, abandoning their high level of finish and heightening the format and line. The Duchess of Morny resold the work to the h√¥tel Drouot in 1878 for 5000 francs. It arrived in the USA just before 1901. The art dealer Paul Durand-Ruel's New York branch exhibited it in June 1906 and - after passing through a number of different hands - Harry Payne Bingham offered it to its present owners in 1940Gustave Courbet (1819-1877), catalogue de l'exposition de 2007, pp.168-169..

He sometimes used the pseudonym \\"Louis de Vernon\\". Life Born in Isigny-sur-Mer, he trained as a lawyer in Paris and then - thanks to his links with the Legitimists - was arrested after the French Revolution of 1848. After his release he travelled in northern Europe and the Mediterranean, visiting Liguria in 1850 and giving a long description of Genoa's historic city centre in his travel journal Br√®ve vision hivernale d'un voyageur normand. On his return to France in 1851, he was made a doctor of letters at Caen University after writing a thesis on Aeschylus. He then worked as an arts and literary critic for several newspapers such as la Vie √† la campagne, Le Nord (published in Belgium), Le Constitutionnel, La Gazette, Le Figaro and L'Illustration. Alternating between original work and translation, he collaborated with Gustave Dor√©, producing an illustrated 1876 work on the industrial revolution in London, widely admired for the realism of its over 170 woodcuts and for its text, comparing London's architecture with the neoclassical monuments √ânault had visited in Valletta on Malta during his travels on French medieval crusader routes. His translations into French include Uncle Tom's Cabin and The Sorrows of Young Werther. He died in Paris.

SWEEPM was conceived in 2008 and completed in April 2013. The model provides simulated performance data on conceptual or existing guided artillery rounds. Ballistic engineers analyze information gathered on the effectiveness of a round in battle, such as impact against a tank or truck. SWEEPM software can measure other variables such as material composition of the round, muzzle velocity, how soldiers aim and fire weapon systems, weather, and stationary or moving targets. This information assists researchers in studying scenarios that indicate the amount of damage the round causes. Researchers rely on high- performance computers housed within the ARL Supercomputing Research Center managed by ARL's Computational and Information Sciences Directorate at Aberdeen Proving Ground, Maryland. SWEEPM's high-fidelity physics sub-modules can only be run on these supercomputers. Mary K. Arthur, a mathematician in the Lethality Division of ARL, is the principal investigator credited with developing SWEEPM after recognizing a void in modeling and analyzing smart weapon systems from target acquisition through damage estimation.

The mosque is located in Sivrihisar il√ße (district) of Eski≈üehir Province. It was built by Le≈üker Emir Celaleddin Ali in 1231‚Äì1232 during the reign of Anatolian Seljuk Sultan Kayqubad I (r. 1220‚Äì1237). It saw later two restorations, in 1275 by Emin√ºddin Mikail bin Abdullah, the regent of Kaykhusraw III (r. 1265‚Äì1284), and in 1440 by Hƒ±zƒ±r Bey, a judge in Sivrihisar and later the first judge in Istanbul. The mosque is a rare example of wooden-columned architectural technique in Anatolia together with four others. The ground area of the mosque is . It has a rectangular plan. The outer walls are of ashlar. It has four entrances. Marble inscriptions showing the historical restoration dates are found on the northern and eastern gates. The roof is covered by tiles, which were replaced by lead sheet not long ago. The roof is carried by 67 wooden columns in the inside, of which upper parts are decorated by painted mostly in green, red and black colors engravings of traditional figures. Some columns stand on stone base having ancient column head. It is likely that the stone columns heads originate from Pessinus, an ancient city known as Ballƒ±hisar today close to Sivrihisar. There are six naves in east-west direction. The middle naves are higher than the others resembling the historic Turkic tents used in the nomadic era the Central Asia. The mosque's minbar, the pulpit, is a masterwork made by Horasanlƒ± ƒ∞bni Mehmet in 1245, and is famous for its ornaments in geometrical and floral design engraved in walnut wood. It is believed that the minbar was brought here from the Sivrihisar Kƒ±lƒ±√ß Masjid, which was demolished in 1924. The minaret was added by Osman oƒülu Hacƒ± Habib in 1409‚Äì1410 according to its inscription.

The two districts also shared superintendents, teachers, and athletic facilities. In 2010, Anthon‚ÄìOto had about 250 students while Maple Valley had about 505 students. The first merger election between the two districts came in 2005. Maple Valley voters favored the deal, but Anthon‚ÄìOto voters turned it down, partly due to fear of being politically dominated by the larger Maple Valley, and also because they were unwilling to pay for a new high school in the Maple Valley area.

The film is also lampooning singers like Sidhu Moose Wala‚Äôs violent songs, Parmish Verma's infamous shooting incident to bridge this dilemma whereas music, given by Rahar Fateh Ali Khan and Guru Randhawa, saves the day, being refreshing and soulful.\\" Reviewer appreciates the work of Sapna Pabbi, saying, \\"TV actress, Sapna Pabbi (who plays Simran), is just another pretty addition to Punjabi cinema, perfectly towing the precedence of being only a dolled-up prop to the script.\\" Reviewer of website BookMyShow praised the direction work of Simerjit Singh, saying, \\"Simerjit Singh's direction has its trademark humor and it works for most parts of the film. He is better off in emotional and romantic scenes.\\" Reviewer also praised the script written by Gippy Grewal whereas criticized the dialogues, saying, \\"At times, the characters try too hard to make you laugh. The dialogues also seem forced at places.\\" On last added, \\"On the whole, Mar Gaye Oye Loko is a fun, clean film that works despite the over- the-top comedy. It takes funny jibes at death and the afterlife and that's where the film succeeds. Do not compare it with Carry on Jatta 2 or expect the same team to deliver a similar laughathon and you would enjoy the film thoroughly.\\" References External links * Category:Indian romantic comedy films Category:Indian films with live action and animation Category:Indian films Category:Films directed by Simerjit Singh Category:2010s Punjabi-language films Category:2018 romantic comedy films ","title":"Mar Gaye Oye Loko"},{"id":"57915651","text":"Mordechai ben Abraham Finzi (, 1407‚Äì1476 in Mantua) was a Jewish mathematician, astronomer, grammarian and physician in Mantua.

Similar to the Slow Food movement ‚Äî aimed at preserving local, sustainable food and traditional cooking ‚Äî Slow Flowers encourages consumers to support their local economy and consciously purchase cut flowers grown locally, seasonally and ethically in the United States, instead of purchasing flowers imported from other countries or flowers grown using chemicals and pesticides. The philosophy behind slow flowers is part of the wider slow movement. The Slow Flowers Community was founded by author and writer Debra Prinzing in 2014 after she authored a book titled Slow Flowers, in which the term \\"slow flowers movement\\" was coined, and the movement has since spread internationally. The Slow Flowers Movement The inspiration behind the philosophy of Slow Flowers can be traced back to author Amy Stewart‚Äôs book Flower Confidential: The Good, the Bad and the Beautiful (2007), which provides an in-depth look into the floral industry. Among its revelations, the book sheds light on the genetic engineering and breeding of flowers, the exploitation of workers, pollution and the importation of cheap flowers in the flower industry. In the U.S., consumers spend on average between $7 billion and $8 billion on cut flowers annually. Of those flowers, imported cut flowers account for 80 percent, with an estimated 5.6 billion stems sold annually imported from countries including Colombia, Costa Rica, Ecuador, Mexico, Netherlands, Dominican Republic, Malaysia, Thailand, Peru, Guatemala, Chile, India, Italy, Kenya, South Africa, Israel, Spain, Japan, Canada, Ethiopia, Australia, Nicaragua, New Zealand, Taiwan, Vietnam, Argentina, Brazil, Zimbabwe and France.Article in U.S. Department of Agriculture In the U.S., cut flowers largely come from the west coast in California where blooms like daffodils, orchids and mums are grown. American- grown flowers used to account for 64 percent of the flowers sold domestically, according to data from 1991. However since then, and shortly after the introduction of the Andean Trade Promotion and Drug Eradication Act, the number of domestically-grown flowers sold in the U.S. has been on the decline, with 50 percent of North American flower farms no longer in business due to the competing, cheaper prices of flowers grown in South America. In terms of cost, flowers grown in the U.S. often cost more to produce which means they can be more expensive compared to imported flowers. Imported products are also not generally required to meet the same environmental and labor standards as crops and products grown domestically, which also influences pricing. Additionally, country of origin labeling laws are not enforced, so the origin as well as ethical and environmental footprint of flowers are largely unknown. However, it has been stated that stiffer regulations are now in place in Colombia and Ecuador‚Äôs industries with bans on certain chemicals and minimum wage requirements. In both the U.S. and South America, there are certification programs like Veriflora, Florverde, Bloom Check, Certified Naturally Grown and Salmon Safe that growers can participate in that focus on improving environmental standards, meaning blooms grown with these certifications are grown under stricter guidelines with less chemicals and harmful pesticides, and some of these programs also focus on worker standards. The Slow Flowers movement has been part of the effort to establish a philosophy of employing sustainable practices, supporting the local economy and reducing chemical use through the purchase of domestically and ethically grown flowers that is being adopted by florists, flower farmers and consumers. To garner additional support for the movement and flowers grown and sold domestically in the U.S., and to help address the lack of knowledge around origins of flowers and the no-labeling requirement for flowers in the U.S., the Certified American Grown label has since been placed on the sleeves of blooms sold in grocery stores including Trader Joe's, Whole Foods and Safeway. Labels such as ‚Äúfair trade‚Äù, ‚Äúorganic‚Äù and ‚Äúsustainable‚Äù are also placed on bouquets sold in grocery stores and through online retailers. In the last decade, the number of flower farms selling cut flowers domestically increased almost 20 percent between 2007 and 2012 from 5,085 to 5,903, according to the USDA. Farm shares or community supported agriculture (CSAs) are also featuring fresh flowers as part of their annual subscription services, offering large to small bouquets that are collected weekly or bi-weekly alongside farm-grown fruits and vegetables. Additionally, the U.S. has seen the development of the Congressional Cut Flower Caucus, which has helped leverage additional support in raising awareness about supporting American flower farmers and floral products. Slow Flowers Community At its core, Slow Flowers was established to promote the conscious purchase of buying and selling locally and sustainably grown flowers in the United States. The Slow Flowers Community has 600 members. Members of the Slow Flowers community are predominantly small-scale growers, producers and designers who are working to transform the flower industry by leveraging the field-to-vase or locally grown flowers philosophy.

She is a lecturer at Shenkar College of Engineering and Design, Ramat-Gan.  Career  In 2007, Attoun took part in The Finalists Exhibition and the Tel Aviv Museum of Art, for the Nathan Gottesdiener Foundation Israel Art Prize 2008. The exhibition also included Michal Helfman, and Gil Marco Shani. The work of these three artists together was significant because they extended from painting to installation. In 2015, Attoun had a solo exhibition in Givon Art Gallery in Tel Aviv titled Half Full. For the exhibition, Attoun completely changed the interior of the gallery, building walls and corridors to resemble a house. The space was made to look like a \\"half full◊¥ apartment, in which the viewer is made to assume the dweller has left the premise of the property, but some of their belongings remain. The exhibition was well-received. In 2017, Attoun had a solo exhibition at the Haifa Museum of Art titled Lover's Eye. The exhibition encompassed twenty-five framed eye drawings. The drawings allude to the 18th century eye miniatures of \\"Lovers‚Äô Eyes,\\" usually painted with watercolor on ivory or parchment. In 2018, Attoun published an Artist book, titled Weekly Planner 2018 where she revisits the year of 1818. The book marks the 200th anniversary of Mary Shelley‚Äôs Frankenstein ‚Äì hybridizing the two years through monochromatic drawings akin to old manuscripts, etchings and prints. = Style, Technique and Themes = Attoun is a multidisciplinary artist. Her works involve a variety of mediums; yet, drawings comprise an important element in her body of work. Her drawings are often in pencil. Attoun's installations typically encompass a variety of media, including murals, drawings, prints, sculptural objects, ready-mades and sound art. Much of Attoun's imagery thematically surrounds the body. Some of elements of her visual arsenal include, animals, skulls, hearts, blood vessels, ropes, stalks and cups. Attoun's installations are part of a feminist trend, which combine beauty and horror, blood and disease, body and home. Much of Attoun's imagery is associated with formal European iconography and motifs, drawing reference from the Neo-Gothic, Romantic, Pre-Raphaelite and Arts-and-Crafts movements of the 18th‚Äì19th centuries.

Byfield, first judge of the Court of Vice- Admiralty, was born in 1653, at Long Ditton, Surrey, England, the twenty-first child of Richard Byfield, rector there, and grandson of the vicar of Stratford-on-Avon. His father, as a member of the Westminster Assembly, helped to prepare the Westminster Shorter Catechism. His mother, Sarah Juxon, was, like many early New Englanders, 'nearly related' to an Archbishop of Canterbury. Byfield arrived in Boston in 1674, and the next year married Deborah, daughter of Captain Thomas Clarke. Having been drafted to fight the Indians, he based a claim for exemption on XXIV Deuteronomy 5. At the close of King Philip's War he invested heavily in Rhode Island lands, becoming a settler at Bristol, Rhode Island, and living part of the time at Pappoosquaws Point better known in connection with Nathanael Herreshoff, the famous yacht builder. Byfield joined the Ancient and Honorable Artillery Company in 1679, was a member of the Massachusetts General Court in 1696 and 1697, and served as speaker in 1698. He was commissioner for forming the excise, and judge of probate for Bristol County, as well as of the Inferior Court of Common Pleas in Bristol and Suffolk. In June, 1710, he was suspended from the office of judge of probate 'for unmannerly and rude behaviour,' but resumed office in December, 1715. He was the first judge of the Court of Vice-Admiralty from 9 June, 1699, to 20 May, 1700, when Wait Winthrop obtained the place. Byfield threatened Winthrop and succeeded, through Governor Dudley, in securing his removal in 1701; he obtained the office for himself in December, 1703, holding it until 1715, and a third time from 1728 to 1733. In earlier years the judge exercised much influence through his political alliance with Dudley and his marriage, in 1718, to Governor Leverett's daughter Sarah, following the death of his first wife. Cotton Mather, in February, 1702 or 3, received a visit from Governor Dudley, whom Mather advised to allow no people to say that the governor's policies were dictated by Byfield and Leverett. Mather continues: 'The Wretch went unto those Men, and told them, that I had advised him, to be no ways advised by them: and inflamed them into an implacable Rage against me.' Byfield was a man of positive traits, dictatorial and overbearing, ambitious and revengeful, yet so sound that no decision of his was ever, upon appeal, reversed by a higher court. He printed and gave away thousands of copies of the Shorter Catechism; he strenuously opposed the witchcraft delusion, gave hundreds of pounds yearly in charity, and devoted his eloquence freely to public affairs. He died between the hours of one and two of the morning of the 6th of June, 1733, at Boston, and was entombed at Granary Burying Ground. Two of his five children grew to maturity, one the wife of Lieutenant Governor William Tailer, another the wife of Edward Lyde, whose son, Byfield Lyde (son-in-law of Governor Belcher), was his chief heir. At Granary Burying Ground, Byfield rests in Tomb #49 or #50, which is marked by stone bearing the Lyde family crest, along the Tremont Street fence.

Its main business activities are divided up into four divisions: AgriCare (fertilisers and crop protection), Ingredients (additives for the food industry, animal feed industry and personal care industry), Performance Chemicals (additives for the chemical industry) and Polymers (additives for the rubber and plastics industry).  History  = From the beginning to the First World War = Theodor August Behn arrived in Singapore on 5 July 1839. He went on to trade on his own account and made the most of the business opportunities provided by the outbreak of the First Opium War.Sieveking: Die Anf√§nge, p. 189. Helfferich: Zur Geschichte, vol. I, p. 54‚Äì61. His friend Valentin Lorenz Meyer arrived in Singapore on 1 November 1840, which is considered to be the date on which Behn, Meyer & Co. was founded.Sieveking: Die Anf√§nge, p. 191‚Äì193. Helfferich: Zur Geschichte, vol. I, p. 69. The company was the first German trading company in Singapore.Helfferich: Zur Geschichte, vol. I, p. 69. Yacob: Trans- generational renewal, p. 4. It traded both on behalf of other companies (transactions on a commission basis) and on its own account. Regional products played a major role in its business activitiesSieveking: Die Anf√§nge, p. 194 f. Helfferich: Zur Geschichte, vol. I, p. 94. Kleinsteuber: Merchants, p. 54 f and p. 63 f. and it also sold European goods in Southeast Asian ports.Helfferich: Zur Geschichte, vol. I, p. 93. Kleinsteuber: Merchants, p. 63. In 1848, Valentin Lorenz Meyer left Singapore to move to HamburgSieveking: Die Anf√§nge, p. 208. Helfferich: Zur Geschichte, vol.

I, p. 103‚Äì106. In 1851, Behn, Arnold Otto Meyer and Friedrich Albert Schreiber signed a new partnership agreement. In mid-1852, Behn also returned to Hamburg, where he represented the business interests of the company.Helfferich: Zur Geschichte, vol. I, p. 107. On 8 May 1857, Arnold Otto Meyer also arrived in Hamburg and went on to establish the company named after him in the city on 1 June 1857Sieveking: Das Haus Behn-Meyer & Co. in Singapore, p. 123. Helfferich: Zur Geschichte, vol. I, p. 128 f. Yacob: Trans- generational renewal, p. 1. Just one year later, the consequences of the Panic of 1857 posed an existential threat to the company . Arnold Otto Meyer initially remained in Hamburg and worked to maintain the market liquidity of both companies, Arnold Otto Meyer and Behn, Meyer & Co. In 1862, he returned to Singapore for two years, during which he advanced the company's business activities.Sieveking: Das Haus Behn-Meyer & Co. in Singapore, p. 123‚Äì127. Helfferich: Zur Geschichte, vol. I, p. 137‚Äì146. Up until the start of World War I, both companies continued to grow, although for many years, Arnold Otto Meyer did not carry out any business on its own account but instead as an agent, paying agent and purchaser for Behn, Meyer & Co.Kleinsteuber: Merchants, p. 77‚Äì80. Nevertheless, in 1906, Arnold Otto Meyer took control of the company Behn, Meyer & Co.Helfferich: Zur Geschichte, vol. II, p. 99‚Äì101. Yacob: Trans-generational renewal, p. 5. Yacob: The Rise of the Phoenix, p. 11.

Yacob: Trans-generational renewal, p. 6. Kleinsteuber: Merchants, p. 96. By 1914, the Group had a total of eleven branches in Southeast Asia and the Far East,Yacob: The Rise of the Phoenix, p. 15. including locations in Hong Kong, Canton and Shanghai. Alongside its trading activities, this was also the result of the shipping agencies run by Behn, Meyer & Co.Kleinsteuber: Merchants, p. 90. Its other important lines of business were plantation management (participation in the Straits & Sunda Syndicate),See Helfferich: Zur Geschichte, vol. II, p. 117‚Äì120.

Kleinsteuber: Merchants, p. 110, p. 116 and p. 180. In the 1920s, the company was able to re-establish its position in Southeast Asia. The origins of this development were the founding of a company under Dutch law in Amsterdam after the warYacob: The Rise of the Phoenix, p. 19 and p. 21. and its business operations in the Dutch East Indies via the N.V.

In 1925, Arnold Otto Meyer took over the overseas export trading companies of the Hugo Stinnes Group. This provided the Group with access to the markets in South Africa, South America (Argentina, Colombia and Chile) and in China.Helfferich: Zur Geschichte, vol. II, p. 157 f. See also Gerald D. Feldman: Hugo Stinnes. Biographie eines Industriellen. 1870‚Äì1924. Translated from English by Karl Heinz Silber, M√ºnchen, 1998, p. 946. . The Great Depression hit the company hard. After the National Socialist seizure of power, the state supported financially suffering overseas trading companies by means of pseudo- investments: investments were not paid (making the state a limited partner) but instead made available in the form of bank discount facilities. In actuality, these instruments acted as state security for high-interest loans.Kleinsteuber: Merchants, p. 193 f. The autarkic policy of the National Socialists continued to have a negative impact on business and the loan burden remained until finally eradicated in 1958/1962.Kleinsteuber: Merchants, p. 197 f. Aryanization became a main characteristic of National Socialist economic policy. In 1938, Arnold Otto Meyer took over the Tanning Agent division of Blau & SchindlerMentioned in Frank Bajohr: ‚Ä≥Arisierung‚Ä≥ in Hamburg. Die Verdr√§ngung der j√ºdischen Unternehmer 1933‚Äì1945. 2nd edition, Hamburg, 1998, , p. 350. after the Jewish proprietors of the company founded in 1877 were forced to emigrate. Arnold Otto Meyer ‚Ä≥accepted the terms and conditions proposed without hesitation, proceeded with the acquisition of the firm and its employees and opened up a new own division for tanning agents‚Ä≥.Kleinsteuber: Merchants, p. 209. The company's business volume decreased after the start of World War II.Kleinsteuber: Merchants, p. 209‚Äì214. Tapping into new markets in the areas seized by the armed forces also failed to change this trend. Attempts to establish the company in the Ukraine, for example, were also unable to achieve lasting success.Kleinsteuber: Merchants, p. 215 f. As was the case during the First World War, many of the company's employees were interned overseas.Kleinsteuber: Merchants, p. 139 f, p. 147, p. 219, p. 237 f., p. 253‚Äì255 and p. 303‚Äì305. During the bombing of Hamburg, bombs struck the ‚Ä≥Kontorhaus‚Ä≥ buildings along the Alsterdamm street (house numbers 1 and 2) and in Ferdinandstra√üe (no. 2). Only the offices in the ‚Ä≥Kontorhaus‚Ä≥ building at Alsterdamm 1, known as the Haus Alsterblick,Ralf Lange: Das Hamburger Kontorhaus. Architektur, Geschichte, Denkmal. M√ºnchen, Hamburg [et. al.], 2015, p. 214 f. . and at Ferdinandstra√üe 2 could still be used.Kleinsteuber: Merchants, p. 217 and p. 258. = The 1950s to the end of the 1990s = After the end of the war, the company was able to retain its headquarters in Hamburg. All of its overseas possessions were lost.Yacob: Trans-generational renewal, p. 8. Arnold Otto Meyer initially worked in the scrap trade and the sales and distribution of anti-corrosion paint within the British Zone of Occupation.Kleinsteuber: Merchants, p. 264 f. Given that German companies were excluded from business in Malaya and Singapore for ten years,Yacob: The Rise of the Phoenix, p. 23. the company was able to achieve economic recovery thanks to support from a long-standing British business partner, who took care of the business of Behn, Meyer & Co. and the N.V. Straits Java Trading Co. Arnold Otto Meyer also founded a Danish company that was able to initiate business in Indonesia together with A. P. M√∏ller.Kleinsteuber: Merchants, p. 439‚Äì443. At the end of the 1950s, Behn, Meyer & Co. was yet again considered to be the leading German trading company in Southeast Asia. It had vastly expanded its range of goods for export business and was again entrusted with a multitude of agencies. The company also acted as a sales and distribution base and service provider for corresponding customers. In 1982, 125 years after Arnold Otto Meyer was first founded, more than 100 members of staff worked for the group of companies in Hamburg, accompanied by around 900 employees in Asia, South Africa and the Caribbean. At the time, the Group was able to generate external revenue of nearly one billion DM.Kleinsteuber: Merchants, p. 328. The 1980s and 1990s posed a number of significant challenges for the group of companies. On the one hand, technical innovations caused certain products and brands to disappear from the market (for example office machines from Olympia). On the other hand, manufacturers or brand owners decided to expand abroad themselves and set up their own sales and distribution companies and/or production facilities. As a result, they no longer required agencies. Furthermore, wholesale and overseas traders became less important given that direct communication between providers and customers became increasingly faster and more transparent.Kleinsteuber: Merchants, p. 331 f. Imports to Germany and Europe also underwent changes: while the tin business remained extremely profitable until the 1970s, it then declined more and more as customers started to purchase goods directly from manufacturers. The Group additionally abandoned its traditional importation of rubber at the end of the 1990s. Further tropical products met a similar fate.Kleinsteuber: Merchants, p. 313‚Äì316. The company also faced two further problems: The attempts made by the group of companies to establish itself in the engineering business failed to pay offKleinsteuber: Merchants, p. 382‚Äì385. and the importation of canned fruit and vegetables in the 1990s resulted in losses that threatened its very existence.Kleinsteuber: Merchants, p. 321‚Äì324. = The company since the late 1990s = The company decided to take a new approach.Kleinsteuber: Merchants, p. 575 f. It abandoned its activities in technical areas and in the field of engineering, as well as its distribution of goods for end consumers, and instead focused its business activities on chemical products. The fact that the Group already had decades of experience in the chemical trade proved to be beneficial, particularly with regard to its stronger involvement in the importation, sales and distribution of fertilisers, crop protection products and insecticides since the 1960s.Kleinsteuber: Merchants, p. 388. Another aspect was the fact that Malaysia and Indonesia had been strongly relying on oil palms since the 1960s and the company was able to offer special fertilisers for these palms, especially Nitrophoska.Kleinsteuber: Merchants, p. 398‚Äì406. The company's long-standing cooperation with the FELDA (1980‚Äì2009) also boosted its status and reputation in Malaysia.Shankaran Nambiar: Enhancing institutions and improving regulation: The Malaysian case.

In the 1990s, it started to trade in additives for rubber processing and these activities went on to form a basis for the development of its polymer business. The company Performance Additives was founded in Malaysia in 1999 and focuses on the production, sales and distribution of additives for the rubber and plastics industries.Performance Additives Sdn. Bhd. Website The Ingredients division also started to take form, enabling the Group to offer additives for the food industry, for animal nutrition and for cosmetics. The Group additionally established its Performance Chemicals division, which offers a wide range of products for coatings, for the petroleum and petrochemical industry, for leather and textiles and for water purification.Kleinsteuber: Merchants, p. 475 f. The holding Arnold Otto Meyer changed name in 1999/2000 and has since been known as Behn Meyer Deutschland Holding AG & Co KG. Furthermore, Behn Meyer Holding AG was appointed the managing partner with sole management authorisation (general partner). The aim of these developments was to give the entire company a name that was as consistent as possible. With regard to its operational trading activities in Europe, the Group had already been doing business under the name of Behn Meyer Europe GmbH since 1998.Kleinsteuber: Merchants, p. 545‚Äì550. In 2003, Behn Meyer Europe opened a branch in Amsterdam. In West Malaysia, it purchased a site with an area of 20,000m2 in Pasir Gudang in order to construct a new storage facility and processing plants.Kleinsteuber: Merchants, p. 417. In 2010, a research and development centre commenced operations in Subang Jaya. Comparable institutions were also located in Ho Chi Minh City (Vietnam) and in Indonesia and Thailand.Kleinsteuber: Merchants, p. 500 f and p. 515 f. In 2011, the Group opened a Filipino subsidiary.Kleinsteuber: Merchants, p. 535. At the same time, a new production facility in New Philadelphia, Ohio started to manufacture bitumen-based additives,Kleinsteuber: Merchants, p. 569. with customers for these products primarily located in European and Asia-Pacific markets. The Group additionally acquired the Flexsys Group in Termoli (Italy) in 2011. Flexsys was then renamed Performance Additives Italy. At this location on the Adriatic coast, the company manufactured chemicals predominantly aimed at customers in the automotive supplier, rubber and latex industries.Kleinsteuber: Merchants, p. 561. As a result of takeovers, the group has had locations in Qingdao, Shanghai and Taipei since 2013.Kleinsteuber: Merchants, p. 585. In 2014, Behn Meyer AgriCare opened a production facility in Lahad Datu in East Malaysia/Borneo. In Myanmar, the Myanmar Agribusiness Public Corporation (MAPCO) and BMM Venture ‚Äì a joint venture between Behn Meyer AgriCare and Mitsui ‚Äì agreed to establish and run a joint import, production, sales and distribution company for fertilisers, Agri First, in 2016.

It is a five-storey corner building that overlooks the Au√üenalster and Binnenalster lakes and is located in close proximity to the Lombard Bridge, the Kunsthalle Hamburg and Hamburg Hauptbahnhof central station. The building was planned at the end of the 19th century and completed in 1907. In the Second World War, a bomb destroyed its roof and setback level, both of which were rebuilt in 1959. The building's facade was extensively renovated in two stages between 2002 and 2003. During the renovation work, columns, wrought-iron structures, fluting, cornices, Cotta Sandstone stone work and mosaics were uncovered and restored.

It closed in 2007 and was transformed into the West Bay Discovery Centre in 2018. The former chapel has been Grade II listed since 1975. History Prior to the construction of the church, the West Bay Wesleyan Society, which had formed in 1828, held services and meeting at a local dwelling. As the congregation grew, a Methodist church was built in 1849 by Messrs John Cox and Son, close to West Bay harbour and Chesil Beach. It opened on 4 December 1849 and continued to serve the local community until May 2007, with the exception of a period of closure during World War II. Following the chapel's disuse, West Dorset District Council later sold the chapel to the Bridport Area Development Trust for ¬£1 in 2012. Plans were then created for its conversion into a visitor centre, with planning permission being sought and granted in 2015.

Alfred Cadart (1828-1875) was a French printer, writer and publisher, most notable for his major part in the etching revival in 19th-century France. He played a key role in the revival and sale of etchings in France and beyond. As founder of the French Soci√©t√© des Aquafortistes, he combined strategic understanding with a passion for the artistic qualities of the etching. His efforts to promote the art of etching did not bring him financial success, but he did help develop the infrastructure for original printmaking that emerged in the 1890s. Life He was born in Saint-Omer to a hotelier and began his working life in the Compagnie des chemins de fer du Nord. He married the sister of Fran√ßois Chifflart, a painter.

For a period kindergarteners attended schools in Danbury and Mapleton, all district students in grades 1‚Äì2 attended Mapleton, all students in grades 3‚Äì6 attended school in Castana, all 7th and 8th graders attended school in Danbury, and all high school students attended school in Mapleton. An addition for elementary school and vocational classes in the Mapleton campus was funded by a 1970 school house levy. The peak enrollment was in 1971, with 1,155 students. Since then the enrollment declined. Circa 1993 the district began whole grade-sharing with the Anthon‚ÄìOto Community School District; the two districts sent their own children to each other's schools, with each operating its own elementary school, Anthon‚ÄìOto operating the middle school, and Maple Valley operating the high school. The two districts also shared superintendents, teachers, and athletic facilities. In 2010 Maple Valley had about 505 students. The first merger election between the two districts came in 2005. Maple Valley voters favored the deal but Anthon‚ÄìOto voters turned it down, partly due to fear of being politically dominated by the larger Maple Valley, as Anthon‚ÄìOto had about 250 students, and also because they were unwilling to pay for a new high school in the Maple Valley area. The second merger was scheduled for February 1, 2011.

Biography Hunt was born in Reading, Berkshire, one of seven children to a local builder. She attended a local convent school where, among other achievements, she won a prize in the annual Royal Drawing Society exhibition. Hunt trained to become a teacher but after a health scare gave up that profession and enrolled at the Slade School of Art in London in 1945, where she was taught by William Coldstream. Before leaving the Slade in 1950, Hunt met and married a fellow student, Peter Atkins. Atkins was a sculpture student who became an assistant in Henry Moore's studio in Hertfordshire. In 1953 Hunt and Atkins moved to the Natal when he took a post at the Ndaleni art school near Pietermaritzburg. The art school was the only one in the country for black South Africans but refused to admit women students. Hunt was restricted in the amount of teaching she could undertake but was active in the successful campaign to get the school to admit female students. Hunt returned to Britain in 1959 and in her art adapted a powerful abstract style, which often seemed to suggest plant forms and growth. She had a number of well reviewed exhibitions, including several at the Drian Gallery in London. From 1970 to 1972 Hunt was based in New York City, with a studio space in Manhattan. She met many of the most important artists active in the city at that time, most notably Jules Olitski who, like other proponents of Color Field painting, had a great influence on her work. Hunt began painting large canvases dominated by luminous veils of colour. She began using spray-guns, rather than brushes, to apply paint and create abstract works with a sense of mystery and calmness.

The peninsula is bounded to the west by Loch Eriboll, and to the east by the Kyle of Tongue. The A838 road crosses the peninsula on an east‚Äìwest axis. Much of the peninsula is owned by Melness Estate on behalf of 59 crofters. The peninsula contains large areas of blanket bog covering , forming part of the Flow Country. Eriboll East and Whiten Head, at the western and northern sides of the peninsula, are designated as part of a special landscape area, and the bog is one of 2 Sites of Special Scientific Interest (SSSIs) on the peninsula. The peninsula sits within both a Special Protection Area and a Special Area of Conservation titled the Caithness and Sutherland Peatlands, and is home to greylag geese, golden eagles and dunlin, as well as \\"rare water-dependent plants, dwarf shrubs and alpine heath\\".  Moine path  To the south of the peninsula, a wide track known as the Moine path runs for between Strathmore Hope Road and Kinloch Lodge, where it joins the road around the Kyle of Tongue. The path runs around the northern end of Ben Hope and is popular with walkers. Its origins are unclear but it is thought to have been a drovers' road.  Sutherland spaceport project  In 2018, the peninsula was selected by Highlands and Islands Enterprise as the site for Sutherland spaceport, which would be the United Kingdom's first spaceport. Launches could first take place by 2023. Permission to build the spaceport has been opposed by a holding objection from the Wildland company of billionaire Danish couple Anne and Anders Povlson, who argue that the area is protected under the Ramsar Convention, a 1971 treaty covering internationally important wetlands, ratified by the UK in 1976. The Melness Estate is in favour of the project, whoever, as rent from the spaceport and profit-sharing could help fund efforts to regenerate the peat bog and invest in the local community. In June 2020, The Highland Council provided planning permission for the ¬£17m project, allowing 12 launches a year. the Scottish Land Court has yet to adjudicate on the change in land use.

After reunification he sat as a member of the German parliament (\\"Bundestag\\") between 1990 and 1994.  Life  Dietmar Keller was born at the height of the Second World War into a working class family in Chemnitz, which is also where he grew up. His father was a mechanic. His mother worked in a shop. Dietmar Keller completed his schooling in 1960 and for the next eighteen months undertook his military service in the National People's Army. Between 1962 and 1966 he studied successfully for a in Marxism‚ÄìLeninism at the Karl Marx University (as it was known between 1953 and 1991) at Leipzig, with a focus on history and journalism. He joined the ruling Socialist Unity Party (\\"Sozialistische Einheitspartei Deutschlands\\" / SED) in 1963, the year of his twenty-first birthday. He stayed on at Leipzig as a research assistant - later a senior research assistant - between 1966 and 1970. He received his doctorate in 1969. The work for it involved, in his own words, the study of \\"problems of the development of economic democracy between 1945 and 1952 in the Soviet occupation zone [till October 1949] and the German Democratic Republic [thereafter]. The actual title of his dissertation was \\"The emergence of socialist democracy in the materials production sector of the publicly owned enterprises from the middle of 1948 till the middle of 1952\\" (\\"Die Herausbildung der sozialistischen Demokratie im Bereich der materiellen Produktion der volkseigenen Industrie von Mitte 1948 bis Mitte 1952\\"). As a very young man Keller's ambition had been to become a sports journalist, and as he progressed his academic career he also supplied reports to the sports section of Freie Presse, a regional daily newspaper based in Chemnitz. In November 1970 he took over as Secretary for Sciences, Humanities and Arts (\\"Sekret√§r f√ºr Wissenschaft und Kultur\\") with the party sectional leadership team (\\"SED-Kreisleitung\\") at the Karl Marx University. That lasted till December 1977 when he took over as Party Regional Secretary for Sciences, Humanities, Popular education and Arts (\\"Sekret√§r f√ºr Wissenschaft und Kultur\\") in respect of the Leipzig party regional leadership team (\\"SED- Bezirksleitung\\"). By this time, seven years after receiving his doctorate, he had received his Habilitation for a piece of work on the postwar history of Leipzig University. Identified as a post-graduate student of significant promise, during 1982/83 he accepted the opportunity to study for a year at the Academy for Social Sciences run in Moscow by the Central Committee of the Soviet Communist Party. His lecturers in Moscow included the reformist historian Roy Medvedev who would emerge after 1991 as a leading proponent of Democratic socialism. Responding to an interviewer's question in 1990 Keller acknowledge that even as far back as 1982/83, when he was studying in Moscow, gentle breezes of what came to be known as Glasnost were already discernible in the Soviet capital, both one or two theatres and in some of the (little noticed by foreign observers) activities of Mikhail Gorbachev at the Agriculture Plenum of the Central Committee's Secretariat for Agriculture. After returning home, in April 1984 he moved from Leipzig to Berlin when he was appointed a deputy minister at the . His principal responsibility covered the country's post-school-level colleges and academies. Personal priorities included making the colleges more autonomous in their decision processes, and trying to ensure that admission criteria were based less on social provenance and more on talent. One ambition was \\"to extend the Marxist-Leninist base education at the colleges and academies with religious history, with arts and cultural history, with ethics, morality and aesthetics\\" (\\"\\"das marxistisch- leninistische Grundlagenstudium an den k√ºnstlerischen Hoch- und Fachschulen zu erg√§nzen durch Geistes- und Religionsgeschichte, durch Kunst- und Kulturgeschichte, durch Ethik, Moral und √Ñsthetik\\"\\"). Self evidently, he did not succeed. Between 1988 and 1989 Keller served as Secretary of state (high level official) at the Culture Ministry, with special responsibility for museums and national anniversaries. He then took over from in November 1989 as Minister for Culture in the new Modrow government. He approached the job with high ambitions, but the changes triggered when protesters breaching the Berlin Wall demonstrated that the fraternal Soviet forces had no orders to suppress street protests by force as they had in 1953. It was a difficult time to be an East German government minister: Dietmar Keller would later characterise his five months in the post as a blend of \\"brilliance and misery\\" (\\"Glanz und Elend eines Ministers\\"). In March 1990 East Germany underwent its first (and as matters turned out last) free and fair general election. Replaced at the Culture Ministry by , Keller was elected to the East German national parliament (\\"Volkskammer\\"), representing the Leipzig electoral district. He served as a member of the parliament's Committees for Germany Unification and was also chair of the parliamentary culture committee. Reunification took place, formally, in October 1990. On 3 October, 144 of the 400 former members of the East German Volkskammer became members of a newly enlarged German Bundestag. Of those 144, 24 were members of the PDS (formerly SED), its dominating position in the Volkskammer having been destroyed by the election results seven months earlier. Dietmar Keller was one of the 24 PDS members who transferred from the Volkskammer to the Bundestag in October 1990. A couple of months later General Election was held in which Dietmar Keller was re-elected, now as a \\"list member\\" for the Brandenburg electoral district. He was elected to the important Bundestag enquiry commission, \\"Evaluation of the History and Consequences of the East German dictatorship (\\"Aufarbeitung von Geschichte und Folgen der SED-Diktatur\\")\\" which began its work in March 1992. His seat on the commission was contested, and fellow members of the PDS Bundestag group elected him in preferences to . Ahead of the 1994 election he renounced his Bundestag membership, but he continued to work with the party group in the Bundestag \\"on a consultancy basis\\". Four months after the election he became a personal political assistant to Gregor Gysi, a role in which he continued for eight years till 2002. In addition to producing research papers and analyses, he became a speech writer for Gysi. In December 1996 he married the manager of Gysi's political office, Marlies Deneke. (His previous wife, Gisela Oechelhaeuser, was shortly afterwards unmasked as a Stasi informer (\\"IM\\") during the later 1970s, although the information became public only in 1999.) In May 2002 the Kellers decided to end their working relationship with Gregor Gysi. Gysi and Keller had always been political allies, members of the \\"reforming wing\\" of the PDS (party) even during their time as members of its precursor, the SED (party) during the final years of the German Democratic Republic. By 2002 the reforming wing of the PDS was becoming a lonely place. Gregor Gysi was involved with an \\"expenses scandal\\" involving \\"air miles\\" and would resign from the Berlin city government in July 1992. Although for many ordinary voters he remained the public face of the PDS, among party comrades he had become increasingly isolated. Dietmar Keller, as Gysi's reforming (and intellectually formidable) political ally, had also found himself attacked with increasing savagery by party comrades over the past couple of years, especially after a critical interview that he gave to Der Spiegel in April 2000. Keller himself had not been a Bundestag member for eight years. His resignation from the party later in 2002 reverberated inside the party, but went largely unremarked otherwise.

Many fighters in Ahrar al-Sharqiya are former al-Nusra and Ahrar al-Sham members. In October 2019, the relatively obscure group garnered international attention after its fighters murdered Kurdish politician Hevrin Khalaf, which the UN described as a war crime.  Background  Ahrar al-Sharqiya originated as a unit of Ahrar al-Sham in Deir ez-Zor and continued to function under the banner of Ahrar al-Sham even after the group was expelled from eastern Syria along with their allies including al-Nusra to Idlib and took part in battles against the Syrian government and their allies until 2016 when the group separated itself from Ahrar al-Sham to take part in Operation Euphrates Shield. The group was announced by al-Nusra's former lead Sharia Judge in eastern Syria and Shura Council Member, Abu Maria al-Qahtani in 2016, who is originally from Iraq and has been supportive of Turkish involvement in the Syrian Civil War, whilst also being accused on multiple occasions of causing internal strife in al-Nusra, causing him to be later dismissed from his position in the group. However, the extent of his involvement after announcing the group in 2016 remains unknown, and questions have arisen as to whether he was involved or affiliated with the group at all. Many of the group's members are also from the al-Shaitat tribe. Despite tensions with ISIL, Ahrar al-Sharqiya was reported to be part of a network along with the Turkistan Islamic Party in Syria, helping smuggle ISIL members from Eastern Syria to rebel held areas such as Idlib, whilst also profiting from smuggling fees. According to Syrian Observatory for Human Rights former ISIL members in Deir ez-Zor joined the ranks of Ahrar al-Sharqiya after the Deir ez-Zor campaign. History On 16 September 2016, Ahrar al-Sharqiya announced that they refuse to cooperate with US forces in fighting ISIL during Operation Euphrates Shield because of their support for the People's Protection Units and Syrian Democratic Forces. In September 2016 members of the group taunted, insulted and verbally attacked American forces in al-Rai embedded with the Al-Mu'tasim Brigade, an American spokesmen said that the group posed no threat to American forces and that American forces present were unaware of the protests to their presence, after evacuating American forces the al-Mutasim Brigade asked Ahrar al-Sharqiya members to stop. On January 25 2017, Ahrar al-Sharqiya executed a man near Jarabulus, accusing him of spying for the Syrian Democratic Forces. After taking control of Afrin, fighters from the group allegedly destroyed a liquor store, and 6 fighters and their families from the group reportedly defected to SDF after taking over the area due to disillusionment. On 25 March 2018, A day after taking control of Afrin, Ahrar al-Sharqiya and the Hamza Division clashed in Afrin after the Hamza Division killed an Ahrar al-Sharqiya commander, Ahrar al-Sharqiya also claimed the Hamza Division was looting and stealing on western instruction, during the fighting Ahrar al-Sharqiya seized several checkpoints from the Hamza Division and captured up to 100 fighters from the group.http://www.rudaw.net/english/middleeast/syria/250320182 On 26 March 2018, a day after clashing with the Hamza Division, Ahrar al-Sharqiya stormed the headquarters of the Hamza Division and arrested over 200 fighters from the Hamza Division afterwards. In April 2018, several Hamza Division members were taken captive by Ahrar al-Sharqiya in Afrin until Turkish authorities intervened and settled the tensions between the Hamza Division and Ahrar al- Sharqiya. In July 2018, Ahrar al-Sharqiya began a campaign in Afrin encouraging women to wear the hijab and loose clothing according Islamic law that included putting up posters and handing out fliers in the city. In October 2018, members from the group reportedly coordinated with Turkish authorities to arrest an ISIL member being treated in a hospital in the city of Mersin in Turkey. In November 2018, Turkish forces and allied FSA groups carried out an operation against the Sharqiya Martyrs, a unit belonging to Ahrar al-Sharqiya consisting of 200 fighters, accusing them of not following Turkish orders and committing abuses.http://www.rudaw.net/english/middleeast/syria/181120181 On 9 January 2019, the Gathering of the Eastern Martyrs which is affiliated with Ahrar al- Sharqiya claimed responsibility for an IED attack on an SDF humvee in the Deir ez-Zor Governorate.https://pbs.twimg.com/media/DwfwBQZWoAABH7e.jpg On 12 January 2019, Unknown gunmen killed for 4 members of the Gathering of the Eastern Martyrs at a checkpoint in a village near al-Rai. On 25 January 2019, a fight broke out between an arms dealer and Ahrar al-Sharqiya; in the fight the arms dealer was killed while two of his family members were wounded and two Ahrar al-Sharqiya members were also wounded. On 5 February 2019, Ahrar al- Sharqiya reportedly clashed with the Nour al-Din al-Zenki Movement in Afrin; the reason for the fight is unknown and heavy weapons were reportedly used. In June 2019, the group sent reinforcements from Afrin to Idlib and Hama to help other rebel groups in the area repel a Syrian government-led offensive against rebel-held areas that began in April. On 12 October 2019, fighters from Ahrar al-Sharqiya taking part in a Turkish-led military offensive in eastern Syria against the Syrian Democratic Forces and Kurdish self-rule regions in northeastern Syria, executed Kurdish politician, Hevrin Khalaf on the M4 highway in northern Syria after capturing it from SDF. According to a unidentified activist in Afrin, Ahrar al-Sharqiya was among the Turkish-backed insurgent groups which volunteered to send fighters to Libya as part of a Turkish-led operation to aid the Tripoli-based Government of National Accord in December 2019. Relationship with other groups The group has participated in Turkish led operations against YPG but has come into conflict with groups it allied with in these operations over things such as the distribution of captured equipment and property. Such cases arose in Al-Bab, Al-Rai and Jarabulus in 2016 and again in Afrin city in 2018. On 6 November 2018, the group reportedly clashed with Jaysh al-Islam in Afrin. However, after the clashes between Ahrar al-Sharqiya and Jaysh al-Islam, the two groups released a joint statement apologizing to each other for the violence and agreed to resolve disputes in court and avoid armed confrontations.

Moshfegh initially planned My Year of Rest and Relaxation to be focused primarily on the terror attacks of September 11, 2001, even reaching out to terrorism expert Paul Bremer, though she called off the interview and the project took a different tack. Of her experience writing the novel, Moshfegh said: > I feel like the book was successful in that I graduated out of a lot of > those concerns by writing the book. When I wrote the book, my passion and > anger were located much more outwardly and so the tone of the narrator, who > I think a very angry person, is not something I relate to anymore. My Year of Rest and Relaxation was published on July 10, 2018, by Penguin Press. Plot The unnamed narrator, a slender and beautiful blonde from a wealthy WASP family, is a recent graduate of Columbia University, where she majored in art history. During her senior year in college, both of her parents died‚Äîfirst her father from cancer, then her mother in a suicide caused by an interaction between psychiatric medications and alcohol. Now living on the Upper East Side of Manhattan and increasingly dissatisfied with her post- collegiate life, the narrator finds a conveniently incompetent psychiatrist, Dr. Tuttle, who freely prescribes a variety of sleeping, anti-anxiety, and anti-psychotic medications for the insomnia the narrator reports as her complaint; in fact, the narrator hopes to spend as few hours of the day awake as possible, lulling herself with pills and middle-brow movies she plays on repeat on her VCR, until the aging machine breaks down. When the narrator is fired from her job in an art gallery, she chooses to live off a combination of unemployment payments and her inheritance, while attempting to sleep for a year in an effort to reset her life. But her \\"year of rest and relaxation\\" is regularly interrupted. Her college roommate Reva (who unabashedly envies the narrator's wealth and appearance) makes frequent unannounced visits, which the narrator allows despite her disdain for Reva's social-climbing and annoyance at having to listen to Reva's problems‚Äîher own mother's terminal cancer, a frustrating affair with her married boss. The narrator is also occasionally in contact with an older boyfriend Trevor (a banker who works in the World Trade Center), though he frequently cuts off their relationship to date women his own age, returning when one of them has dumped him or occasionally in response to the narrator's pleading. The narrator initially makes trips out of her apartment only to a local bodega, Dr. Tuttle's office, and the Rite Aid to fill her prescriptions. But as she takes stronger and stronger medications, she begins leaving the apartment in her sleep, among other things to go to nightclubs (or so she gathers from Polaroid photographs and glitter she discovers when she awakes from her multi-day blackout). She also wakes up on a train headed toward the funeral of Reva's mother on New Year's Eve 2000. Convinced these activities‚Äîwhich have no appeal to the narrator in her conscious hours‚Äîare disrupting her efforts at complete rest, she decides she needs to sleep locked inside her apartment. She contacts Ping Xi, an artist represented by the gallery where she used to work, who agrees to bring her food and other necessities for four months in exchange for being allowed to make any kind of art project he wishes while she is unconscious: the only requirement is that all trace of him be gone when she wakes every three days to eat, bathe, and take another pill to put her under again. To prepare, she empties her apartment, giving her designer clothes to the ever-covetous Reva, who has just been dumped by her boss‚Äîunaware that she is pregnant, he arranged a promotion that would transfer her out of his office and to the company's office in the World Trade Center. Reva plans to have an abortion; the narrator sleeps until June 1. When she wakes, she finds the plan has worked. She readjusts to life slowly, spending hours over the summer of 2001 sitting in a park and refurnishing her once-expensively decorated apartment with mismatched, used furniture from Goodwill. But as she hoped, her world view has been transformed by her rest: her contempt for Reva has evaporated and for the first time she earnestly reciprocates her friend's previously-insistent declarations that \\"I love you\\", though now Reva is the one who has become distant. The narrator calls Reva once more, on her birthday in August, but Reva brushes off the call. They never speak again; on September 11, Trevor is in Barbados on his honeymoon but Reva dies in the terror attack on the World Trade Center. The narrator goes out to buy a new VCR to tape the news coverage, returning as time passes to watch the video, in particular footage of a woman leaping out of the tower. Style and themes The author in 2015 My Year of Rest and Relaxation is narrated in the first person, establishing a personage critics describe as \\"an antihero...[who] resists every stereotype of the female nurturer\\" and \\"hypnotically unlikeable\\", perhaps even \\"an attempt to see just how 'unlikeable' characters can get.\\" Reviewing the novel in Pacific Standard, Rebecca Stoner called the narrator's \\"acid insights into the various aspects of life that disgust her...one of the primary pleasures of the novel\\" and in the Chicago Review of Books, Lincoln Michel similarly finds the \\"narrator...an enjoyable hater whose observations are both caustic and insightful.\\" In The New Yorker, Jia Tolentino read the novel differently: though she too notes the novel's \\"withering attention to the gleaming absurdities of pre-9/11 New York City, an environment...beset with delusional optimism, horrifically carefree,\\" Tolentino felt My Year of Rest and Relaxation departed from Moshfegh's earlier work featuring \\"characters who are repulsed by themselves, or who are themselves repulsive.\\" She argued that this novel \\"instead builds a fa√ßade of beauty and privilege around her characters, forcing the reader to locate repulsion somewhere deeper: in effort, in daily living, in a world that swings between tragic and banal.\\" Told in the present tense (while the narrator includes some memories of her past, she recounts them as thoughts occurring to her in the present rather than as flashbacks), the novel is \\"tuned to a hyper-contemporary frequency,\\" Tolentino wrote, with the narrator's indifference to real-life events highlighting the way her plan for self-improvement by tuning out the world contrasts with \\"the oft-preached mandates of authenticity or engagement\\". (At the same time, Tolentino suggests, \\"There is something in this liberatory solipsism that feels akin to what is commonly peddled today as wellness.\\") Critics frequently comment on the \\"blackly funny\\" tone of the novel, though in The Guardian, Anthony Cummins notes that \\"by the end, this comically adversarial narrative\\" has expanded well beyond comedy, \\"hitting multiple marks at once: as an art-school prank, a between-the-lines tale of displaced grief and a pitiless anatomy of gender injustice, it also offers (via the inevitable 9/11 ending) a dark state-of- America fable.\\" Accordingly, critics vary widely in their interpretation of the novel's themes. While some read it as a critique of capitalism or an examination of \\"self-care\\", Stoner also points to \\"an anachronistic belief in the sanctity of art...a faith in the power of art to rouse us, to make us believe that, though the world may feel intolerable, it remains worthwhile to '[dive] into the unknown ... wide awake.'\\" Reception According to literary review aggregator Literary Hub, the novel received very positive reviews. In Slate, Laura Miller praised the novel, saying, \\"Moshfegh excels here at setting up an immediately intriguing character and situation, then amplifying the freakishness to the point that some rupture feels inevitable.\\" The Publisher's Weekly review found the book \\"captivating and disquieting...showcas[ing] Moshfegh's signature mix of provocation and dark humor.\\" Several reviews, including Miller and Publishers Weekly, felt \\"the novel drags a bit in the middle\\", though the ending was widely praised, with Miller saying Moshfegh \\"found a more satisfying way to resolve the plot\\" in My Year of Rest and Relaxation than in her first novel, Eileen. Reviewing the novel in The New Yorker, Jia Tolentino wrote, \\"Ottessa Moshfegh is easily the most interesting contemporary American writer on the subject of being alive when being alive feels terrible.\\" In The New York Times, Dwight Garner was more hesitant in his praise, but ultimately concluded: \\"Moshfegh writes with so much misanthropic aplomb, however, that she is always a deep pleasure to read. She has a sleepless eye and dispenses observations as if from a toxic eyedropper.\\" References External links * My Year of Rest and Relaxation reading and interview with Ottessa Moshfegh at Politics and Prose on July 25, 2018, via YouTube Category:2018 American novels Category:Novels by Ottessa Moshfegh Category:Novels set in New York City Category:Penguin Press books Category:Novels about the September 11 attacks Category:Fiction set in 2001 Category:Novels about art and creativity Category:Novels about abortion Category:Novels about suicide Category:Novels about cancer Category:Novels about death Category:Novels about dreams Category:Novels about drugs Category:Novels set in the 2000s ","title":"My Year of Rest and Relaxation"},{"id":"57916427","text":"Pachydactylus affinis, also known as Transvaal gecko or Transvaal thick-toed gecko, is a species of lizard in the family Gekkonidae.

He served as the Senior Director of the Central Military Band of the People's Commissariat of National Defense of the USSR from 1924 to 1950.  Early life and career  Tchernetsky was born on October 24, 1881 in Odessa to a musical family. From 1892-1893, Tchernetsky studied the trombone in the orchestra of the 24th Dragoon Lubny Regiment in Chisinau, where his uncle was the conductor. In 1911 he entered the St. Petersburg Conservatory, which he graduated in 1917. In 1918 Chernetsky joined the Red Army and was appointed as the head of the military bands of the Petrograd military district. He quickly rose through the ranks, eventually being appointed as the director of the Military Band of the Workers and Peasants Red Army in 1924. After more than 10 years in this position, he formed the Central Military Band of the People's Commissariat of National Defense, which later became the first military band to be formed in modern Russia. In 1935, together with professor Heinrich Neuhaus at the Moscow Conservatory, he created the Military Faculty of the Moscow State Conservatory, where music students get a curriculum based on the conducting and combat repertoire. On 1 August 1937, Cherneysky founded the Moscow Military Music College as a means of building and enhancing the knowledge of potential military musicians in the Red Army. On June 24, 1945, Tchernetsky led the massed bands during the Moscow Victory Parade of 1945 on Red Square. In 1946, he suffered from a paralysis, which resulted in his retirement from active service after 25 years in the armed forces. Tchernetsky died on April 13, 1950 in Moscow. He is buried at Novodevichy Cemetery.http://yiddishmusic.jewniverse.info/chernetskysemen/index.htmlhttp://www.jewmil.com/biografii/item/518-chernetskij- semen- aleksandrovichhttp://www.rgali.ru/object/10908107#!page:1/o:10908107/p:1http://rgali.ru/object/11044794#!page:1/o:11044794/p:1http://www.sovmusic.ru/person.php?idperson=48 Legacy Tchernetsky is highly regarded in the Russian military music sphere and one of the most outstanding Russian military composers in the 20th century. Depending on sources, he wrote between 100-200 marches, patriotic songs and other works in his lifetime. In addition to military marches, he also wrote some socio-political ones such as Glory to the Motherland, Lenin's Call and the March of Moscow Pioneers. Many of his military marches are the most famous and common ones used by the Russian Military Band Service, some of which have been used Moscow Victory Day Parade on Red Square for decades.

He showed promise as a two-year-old in 1883 when he won Sapling Plate. In the following spring he emerged as one of the best horses of his generation in England with emphatic victories in the Craven Stakes and the 2000 Guineas. He had never been entered in the Epsom Derby and finished unplaced when made favourite for the St Leger. He remained in training as a four-year-old in 1885 but became very difficult to manage and was eventually gelded. Background Scot Free was a brown horse bred in England by E Etches. As a yearling he was offered for sale and bought for 250 guineas by James Foy, a professional gambler and bloodstock dealer. He was trained by Tom Chaloner at Newmarket, Suffolk. The colt was originally named Donald II. He was probably the best horse sired by Macgregor, who won the 2000 Guineas and started odds on favourite for the Epsom Derby in 1870. Scot Free's dam Celibacy was a half- sister to Brown Bess, the female-line ancestor of Kennymore. Racing career =1883: two-year-old season= In 1883 Scot Free made three racecourse appearances. He recorded his only victory of the year when he won the Sapling Plate at Sandown Park. =1884: three-year-old season= Scot Free began his second season in the Craven Stakes over the Rowley Mile at Newmarket Racecourse and started the 6/1 second choice in the betting. Ridden by John Osborne he took the lead soon after the start and won \\"easily\\" by three lengths from the favourite Loch Ranza. Following the race the Duchess of Montrose attempted to buy the colt but was dissuaded by the asking price of 10,000 guineas. On 30 April Scot Free started the 3/1 favourite for the 76th running of the 2000 Guineas over the same course and distance. The veteran George Fordham was expected to partner the colt but as he was suffering from ill-health, the ride went to Bill Platt. On the eve of the race Fordham said that he was so weak that he might fall out of the saddle but asked that a bet of ¬£5 should be placed on Scot Free on his behalf. The best fancied of his nine opponents were Royal Fern, Superba (Champagne Stakes) and St Medard. Harvester was the first horse to show in front but Scot Free took the lead before half-way. The favourite never looked in any danger of defeat thereafter and accelerated away from his rivals in the closing stages to win by five lengths from St Medard, with Harvester a head away in third. According to one account he \\"came bounding out of the Abingdon mile bottom [a furlong from the finish] like a cricket ball\\". In the Payne Stakes over ten furlongs at Newmarket two weeks later Scot Free started the 8/15 favourite but was beaten a length by Harvester, to whom he was conceding seven pounds in weight. Scot Free had never been entered in the Derby Stakes and in his absence Harvester ran a dead heat for first place with St. Gatien. At Doncaster Racecourse on 10 September, Scot Free was stepped up in distance for the St Leger over fourteen and a half furlongs. His preparation for the race had not been helped by the very dry conditions which led to unusually firm ground at Newmarket. Ridden by John Osborne he was made the 4/1 favourite but was never among the leaders and finished ninth behind The Lambkin. Scot Free's winnings for the year came to ¬£4,799. =1885: four-year-old season= Scot Free remained in training as a four-year-old in 1885. During a training gallop early in the year, he threw his jockey and attacked another horse, losing several teeth in the ensuing fight. He began his third season in the ¬£2,000 Leicestershire Spring Handicap over one mile at Leicester Racecourse on 11 April for which he was assigned a weight of 120 pounds. He started at odds of 12/1 and came home fifth of the eighteen runner behind the filly Whitelock. A week later at the Craven meeting at Newmarket he finished unplaced in two handicap races, the six-furlong Crawfurd Plate and the one-mile Babraham Plate. At Royal Ascot in June Scot Free started second favourite for the Gold Cup over two and a half miles but finished last of the four runners behind St. Gatien, Eole and The Dutchman. =Later career= Scot Free was not raced in 1886 and was gelded sometime before the 1887 racing season. He won the Trial Plate at the Epsom Spring Meeting, beating The Tyke by a length and a half. He was sold immediately after the race for 650 guineas. Returned to J. Foy, he was last of seven runners in the Brighton High-Wright Plate in August 1887. Pedigree *Scot Free was inbred 4 √ó 4 to Touchstone, meaning that this stallion appears twice in the fourth generation of his pedigree.

Education and career Cornet was educated by the Christian Brothers of Louvain. He entered the novitiate in 1935, earned a teaching degree in 1938, followed by bachelor's, master's, and doctoral degrees in art history from the Catholic University of Louvain in 1945 and 1970, respectively. In 1970, Cornet also became the first local director of the Institut des Mus√©es Nationaux du Congo (IMNC) and then, in 1971, director of the Institut des Mus√©es Nationaux du Za√Øre (IMNZ). The IMNC was founded without either a building or any objects, so Cornet's primary task was to develop the museum's collections. He did so primarily among the Woyo, the Kuba, and the Nkundu peoples. He documented his findings in field notebooks and binders of photo negatives with the aim of eventually developing a ten volume History of Congolese Art. Cornet retired from the directorship of the IMNC in 1987 and returned to Belgium in 1992 where he continued researching, publishing and lecturing, especially on tracking looted objects from the museum following the 1997 collapse of the Mobutu regime. Following his death in 2004, Cornet's archive of photographic negative binders, field notebooks, language and personal notes, printed materials, and other research objects were donated to the Loyola University New Orleans Special Collections & Archives.

Sake, also referred to as a Japanese rice wine, is an alcoholic beverage made by fermenting rice that has been polished to remove the bran. Unlike wine, in which alcohol is produced by fermenting sugar that is naturally present in fruit, sake is produced by a brewing process more akin to that of beer, where starch is converted into sugars which ferment into alcohol. A A cup of amazake ;Acidity The quality of sake that gives it its crispiness and vitality. A proper balance of acidity must be struck with the other elements of a sake, or else the sake may be said to be too sharp ‚Äì having disproportionately high levels of acidity ‚Äì or too flat ‚Äì having disproportionately low levels of acidity. ;Alcohol Generally refers to ethanol, a chemical compound found in alcoholic beverages. It is also commonly used to refer to alcoholic beverages in general. ; Alcoholic fermentation The conversion by yeast of sugar into alcohol compounds ;Amakuchi ÁîòÂè£ sweeter than neutral sake ;Amazake ÁîòÈÖí a traditional sweet, low-alcoholic Japanese drink made from fermented rice. ;Aminosan-do „Ç¢„Éü„ÉéÈÖ∏Â∫¶ the taste of umami or savoriness. As the proportion of amino acids rises, the sake tastes more savory. This number is determined by formol titration of the sake with a mixture of sodium hydroxide solution and formaldehyde, and is equal to the milliliters of 0.1mol/l sodium hydroxide required to neutralize the amino acids in 10 ml of sake. ;Atsukan ÁÜ±Ááó heated sake; typically only lower-quality sake is served hot, as high heat tends to destroy subtle flavors and aromas. Mostly consumed in cold winter months. D ;Daiginj≈ç-shu Â§ßÂêüÈÜ∏ÈÖí Very special brew sake made from highly-polished (polished to 50% or less) rice and fermented at low temperature ;Doburoku ÊøÅÈÖí the classic home-brew style of sake although home brewing is illegal in Japan. It is created by simply adding k≈çji mold to steamed rice and water and letting the mixture ferment. The resulting sake is somewhat like a chunkier version of nigorizake. F ;Fukumi-ka Âê´„ÅøÈ¶ô sake aromas smelled retronasally ;Fukurozuri Ë¢ãÂêä„Çä a method of separating sake from the lees without external pressure by hanging the mash in bags and allowing the liquid to drip out under its own weight.

Today masu are largely used for drinking sake, as the advent of modern rice cookers and a higher calorie diet in Japan has made them impractical for measuring portions of rice, and the standard size is one g≈ç, or 0.18039 L. ;Moto ÈÖõ yeast starter ;Moromi Ë´∏Âë≥ or ÈÜ™ main fermenting mash in production of sake or soy sauce ;Muroka ÁÑ°ÊøæÈÅé unfiltered. It refers to sake that has not been carbon filtered, but which has been pressed and separated from the lees, and thus is clear, not cloudy. Carbon filtration can remove desirable flavors and odors as well as bad ones, thus muroka sake has stronger flavors than filtered varieties. ;Mushimai Ëí∏„ÅóÁ±≥ steamed rice N Nigorizake ;Namagusai ÁîüËá≠„ÅÑ or ËÖ•„ÅÑ raw fish stink or taste, amplified in sushi tasting when beer or some wines are consumed rather than sake ;Nama Choz≈çshu ÁîüË≤ØËîµÈÖí essentially a semi-Namazake, this sake is stored unpasteurized and heated only once before shipping to conserve the nama freshness while reducing the risk of spoilage ;Namazake ÁîüÈÖí sake that has not been pasteurized. It requires refrigerated storage and has a shorter shelf-life than pasteurized sake. ;Nigorizake ÊøÅ„ÇäÈÖí cloudy sake. The sake is passed through a loose mesh to separate it from the mash. It is not filtered thereafter and there is much rice sediment in the bottle. Before serving, the bottle is shaken to mix the sediment and turn the sake white or cloudy. ;Nihonshu Lit. \\"Japanese liquor\\", a more specific term than sake, which can mean any kind of alcohol ;Nihonshu-do Êó•Êú¨ÈÖíÂ∫¶ calculated from the specific gravity of the sake, and used to indicate the sugar and alcohol content of the sake on an arbitrary scale.

Generally, the lower the number, the better the sake's potential. A lower percentage usually results in a fruitier sake, whereas a higher percentage will taste more like rice. ;Seimaiki Á≤æÁ±≥Ê©ü rice huller; rice polishing machine ;Seishu Lit. \\"clear liquor\\", the legal term for sake printed on all sake labels. ;Shiboritate ÊêæÁ´ã„Å¶ \\"freshly pressed\\", refers to sake that has been shipped without the traditional six-month aging/maturation period. The result is usually a more acidic, \\"greener\\" sake. ;Shimpaku ËäØÁôΩ the opaque, white center of a polished rice kernel ;Shinseki Êµ∏Êº¨ rice soaking ;Shinshu Êñ∞ÈÖí \\"new sake\\", sake released in late winter or early spring ;Shinshu- bana Êñ∞ÈÖí„Éê„Éä new sake aroma, young, green, ripe aromas ;Shizukuzake Èõ´ÈÖí meaning \\"drip sake\\", a method of separating sake from the lees without external pressure by hanging the mash in bags and allowing the liquid to drip out under its own weight by gravity. ;Shubo ÈÖíÊØç Lit. \\"mother of sake\\", yeast mash; yeast starter ;Sokuj≈ç ÈÄüÈÜ∏ \\"quick fermentation\\", is a method of preparing the starter mash, invented in late Meiji Period (around 1900) by Eda Kenjiro. Lactic acid, produced naturally in the two slower traditional methods, is added to the starter to inhibit unwanted bacteria. Sokuj≈ç sake tends to have a lighter flavor than kimoto or yamahai. ;Sugitama ÊùâÁéâ ball made from sprigs of Japanese cedar (Êùâ, sugi), traditionally hung in the eaves of sake breweries T ;Tamagozake ÂçµÈÖí or ÁéâÂ≠êÈÖí a cocktail consisting of heated sake, sugar and a raw egg ;Taruzake Ê®ΩÈÖí sake aged in wooden barrels or bottled in wooden casks. The wood used is Cryptomeria (Êùâ, sugi), which is also known as Japanese cedar. Sake casks are often tapped ceremonially for the opening of buildings, businesses, parties, etc. Because the wood imparts a strong flavor, premium sake is rarely used for this type. ;Teiseihaku-shu ‰ΩéÁ≤æÁôΩÈÖí sake with a deliberately high rice-polishing ratio. It is generally held that the lower the rice polishing ratio (the percent weight after polishing), the better the potential of the sake. However, beginning around 2005, teiseihaku-shu has been produced as a specialty sake made with high rice-polishing ratios, usually around 80%, to produce sake with the characteristic flavor of rice itself. ;Tejaku ÊâãÈÖå the faux pas of pouring one's own drink ;Tobingakoi ÊñóÁì∂Âõ≤„ÅÑ sake pressed into one to (Êñó, 18-liter (4.0 imp gal; 4.8 U.S. gal)) bottles (ÊñóÁì∂, \\"tobin\\") with the brewer selecting the best sake of the batch for shipping. ;T≈çji ÊùúÊ∞è the head sake brewer at a sake brewery ;Tokubetsu Honj≈çz≈ç-shu ÁâπÂà•Êú¨ÈÜ∏ÈÄ†ÈÖí Special Genuine brew, to differentiate from a brewery's regular Honj≈çz≈ç ;Tokubetsu Junmai-shu ÁâπÂà•Á¥îÁ±≥ÈÖí Special pure rice sake made with rice polished to 60% or less of its original size.

Yamahai skips the step of making a paste out of the starter mash. That step of the kimoto method is known as yama-oroshi, and the full name for yamahai is \\"yama-oroshi haishi\\" (Â±±Âç∏ÂªÉÊ≠¢), meaning \\"discontinuation of yama-oroshi.\\" While the yamahai method was originally developed to speed production time, it is slower than the modern method and is now used only in specialty brews for the earthy flavors it produces. ;Yong≈çbin ÂõõÂêàÁì∂ a 720ml bottle of alcohol, literally a \\"four g≈ç bottle\\" See also *Glossary of viticulture terms *Glossary of winemaking terms *Glossary of wine terms *Sake set References Further reading *National Research Institute of Brewing (2020).

Friedrich. The couple had a daughter Karin but later divorced. With her daughter and her companion Leo Borchard, she helped Jews who were threatened with deportation by the Nazis by providing them with accommodation, forged identity papers and food ration stamps. The group also helped others to escape Germany and distributed flyers advocating resistance to Hitler. Borchard was shot dead in August 1945 by an American soldier after his driver failed to stop at a military checkpoint in Berlin. In 1947, she published a memoir from her diaries Berlin Underground 1938-1945. A second book Battleground Berlin: Diaries 1945-1948 followed in 1962. In 1948, she moved to Munich.

Here, Lewaszkiewicz deals with Slavic projects. but is generally considered a zonal constructed language because it's the result of intense codification (that is, more construction, planning, design, engineering, manipulation than what regular standard languages usually require). Zonal constructed languages are, according to interlinguist Detlev Blanke,Blanke (1985), p. 153. constructed languages which \\"arise by choosing or mixing linguistic elements in a language group\\" (meaning elements from one same language family, for example Slavic or Germanic). Several pan-Romance languages have been developed by different individuals or groups in different times (since the 19th century) and places (Brazil, Canada, Denmark, Italy, Norway, Portugal, Spain, Switzerland, etc.). They are so similar to each other that they have been considered variations of a same language: 'dialects' is how Campos Lima, one of the developers, refers to several projects of his time.Campos Lima (1947), p. 20-21The same has been said of a close group of languages, the naturalistic constructed languages based on the international vocabulary, which include elements from different languages families but are mainly Latin/Romance due to the origin of that vocabulary. According to Blanke (1985: 160), they show similarities with each other to the point that ‚Äòthey appear like dialects of a language‚Äô. This author also shows that the developers of pan-Romance language projects are generally aware of each other, are in contact and even collaborate, which is another sign of unity. Pan-Romance languages are parallel to pan-Slavic languagesSakaguchi (1998: 51-52) deals with ‚Äòpan-Slavic languages‚Äô: ‚Äòlanguage projects with a common Slavic basis‚Äô (‚Äúgemeinslawischer Grundlage‚Äù, in her German original text). She presents several projects, but only describes the structure of one of them (Ruski jezik, by Juraj Kri≈æaniƒá, 1666): it's ‚Äòa naturalistic synthesis of Slavic languages‚Äô (Russian, Croatian and Church Slavonic with 55 to 60% of words common to all Slavic languages, a ‚Äòsort of a reconstruct of proto-Slavic‚Äô. She doesn't equal pan-Slavic languages to zonal constructed languages nor mentions this concept/term. She is here specifically interested in languages created with the intention to unify multiple peoples. The pan-Slavic language Ruski jezik is also based on Polish, according to Meyer (2016: 293).Blanke (1985: 154), after defining what zonal constructed languages are, gives four examples. As Germanic examples he offers a project (Tutonish) based on English with other ‚Äìmainly German‚Äì elements; and another project (Euronord) based on northern Germanic vocabulary. Amongst his Slavic examples, he offers a project (Neuslavische Sprache) based on Slovenian with many Russian elements; and another project (Me≈æduslavjanski jezik) based on ‚Äòthe most important common characteristics of the Slavic languages in Grammar and Vocabulary‚Äô. From all these 4 examples, he only qualifies as an ‚ÄòInterslavic constructed language‚Äô the last one, which means that not all Slavic zonal constructed languages are Interslavic. and pan-Germanic languages.Klaus Schubert (1989: 9-10) says that ‚Äòpan-Slavic‚Äô and ‚Äòpan-Germanic languages‚Äô unify ethnic languages, they are a compromise of ethnic languages. He doesn't equal them to zonal constructed languages, a concept/term that he doesn't mention even though he refers to Blanke (1985), who presents and defines the category.  Uses and benefits  A pan-Romance language is typically intended for communication amongst (or with) speakers of Romance languages, that is as a regional international auxiliary language, for the Latin world. Its vocabulary and grammar are codified to be as communicative as possible for Romance speakers. Words, for example, are chosen preferably if they have cognates among many Romance languages, especially if the meaning is the same or similar. As a result, and thanks to intercomprehension, it's potentially understandable by an audience of up to 800 million speakers of Romance languages. In addition, it can complement Romance intercomprehension in situations where this communication strategy isn't so effective (for example, between French and Romanian speakers). A pan-Romance language can be meant, in some -specially older- projects, to become a global international auxiliary language, in substitution of English, which is also the aim of Esperanto and Interlingua (IALA). In this case, the reason of its Latin/Romance basis is that international vocabulary (that is, words which are common to the most internationally influential languages, many of which are European) is mainly of Latin origin and, in opinion of the developers of these pan-Romance languages,Campos Lima (1948), p. 14 the most natural and coherent grammar to use with the international vocabulary is that of the Romance languages, which evolved from Latin and are, furthermore, spoken by million people on different continents. A pan-Romance language can even be intended, in certain projects, as an artistic language (as a means of artistic expression in poetry, music, etc., as part of a fantasy world in novels, films, etc. or just for the pleasure of creating it). In addition, developers of pan-Romance languages suggest other uses and benefits:Cassany Bates (2017), p. 9 the language can benefit from contributions from Romance's different varieties, which improve and enrich it (with regularizations, expressive means, etc.); it can be a shelter for speakers of Romance languages which are vanishing, like Occitan or Sardinian; it could be effective as a middle step in machine translation between Romance languages; it can be used as a bridge to Romance languages (present and old) and Latin; and it can be practical for foreign speakers as an introduction to Romance.  Background  Shoe advert in Italian on a bus in Barcelona (2011). Latin's descendants, the Romance languages, have developed important differences but share so many traits that they have been considered a unity (a \\"type\\") by Romance linguist Michael Metzeltin.Metzeltin (2004) p. 45: \\"Pese a la gran variaci√≥n que ofrecen los idiomas rom√°nicos, su evoluci√≥n y sus estructuras presentan tantos rasgos comunes que se puede hablar de un tipo ling√º√≠stica rom√°nico\\". He explains the cohesion of the family by its shared Vulgar Latin inheritance, the use and influence of standard Latin until recently and the constant exchanges between Neolatin peoples. The language family as a whole can be referred to as 'Romance',Romance: 'The Romance languages considered as a group' (Lexico Dictionary, powered by Oxford University Press: https://www.lexico.com/en/definition/romance). and it still functions as one language or macrolanguage in some present-day situations, where intercomprehension or accommodation (partial assimilation) take place. For example, some adverts (or parts of them) are published in foreign Romance languages (the attached image shows an advert in Italian on a bus in Barcelona). And mixed varieties like Portu√±ol or Frespa√±ol arise spontaneously to communicate with speakers of other Romance languages, for example while visiting their country. All this shows that spoken and written communication amongst Romance speakers is still a reality and that, to some extent, they are a linguistic community. A manifestation of the tight relationship between different Romance speakers and peoples are the migration flows between Latin countries: Romanians, for example, emigrate preferably to Italy and Spain. And Neolatin countries created in 1954 the Latin Union, an international organization of nations that use Romance languages, which functioned until 2012. Despite these tight connections, since French has been displaced as an international auxiliary language by English, which is a Germanic language, the Latin world lacks a common native language model for the first time in history. = The idea of a pan-Romance language since the Middle Ages= Standard Latin, which preceded French as an international auxiliary language, undergoes lexical modernization to the present dayFor example, with Karl Egger's Neues Latein Lexicon / Lexicon recentis Latinitatis (1992‚Äì97), containing more than 15,000 words for contemporary everyday life. but is based on Classical Latin, the language stage of the late Roman Republic to middle Roman Empire (75 BC to AD 3rd century). The idea of substituting it by a common Romance standard language can be traced back to Dante Alighieri (c. 1265‚Äì1321), who in his essay De vulgari eloquentia deals with the problem of identifying a vernacular language (that is, not Latin) which could be suitable for literary purposes. He starts by compiling a map of the languages he knows, dividing the European territory into three parts: one to the east, with Greek; one to the north, with Germanic (which he believed included Hungarian and Slavic); one to the south, with Romance. He chooses Romance, for being his language, and then carries on his search by distinguishing in Romance three smaller languages, which he identifies by their word for 'yes': oc language, o√Øl language and s√¨ language. He chooses the last variety, arguing that it's more similar to Latin, the literary language of the moment, and has more poets. He then assesses the many Italian varieties in which he subdivides the s√¨ language, but considers no variety suitable. Dante comes to the conclusion that the illustrious vernacular (volgare illustre) which he seeks must still be developed, combining elements from the various Italian varieties.According to Albani and Buonarroti (2001: 33), Dante pursued a vernacular language for global use. In any case, he is generally considered as the \\"father\\" of the Italian language, for example in Zygmunt G. Bara≈Ñski and Simon Gilson (eds.) (2018). The Cambridge Companion to Dante's Commedia. Cambridge University Press, p. 108. After Dante, many other people have conceived independently the idea of a common Romance standard language or even a pan-Romance language, and not only the developers of the projects presented here. For example, Romance scholar Rebecca Posner (University of Oxford) declared that \\"It is not impossible to conceive a Romance interlanguage\\"Posner (1996), p. 344 and interlinguist Detlev Blanke (Humboldt University of Berlin) spoke of a \\"Hochromanisch\\" (in reference to Hochdeutsch, the standard variety of German).Blanke (1985), p. 160.  Pan-Romance languages in the 19th and 20th centuries  = Lingua Romana = Lingua RomanaAlbani, Buonarroti (2001) is an artistic language which the German poet Stefan George (1868-1933) used in part of his lyrical work. He started using Lingua Romana, a mixed Romance language, at a young age, in 1889. It is his own artistic creation, closest to Spanish but with elements from Italian and (Vulgar) Latin. The combinations are motivated by their sound effect in the poems, according to Radaelli.Radaelli (2016) George himself explains Lingua Romana with these words (in Spanish): ‚ÄúLa idea que desde mi juventud me atormenta [...][es] concebir yo mismo una lengua literaria para mis propios fines a partir de material claro, rom√°nico, de similar sonoridad as√≠ como f√°cilmente comprensible.‚Äù Some of his poems in Lingua Romana are La Rosa Galba and Paz, which he later translated into German. Lingua Romana was later codified and proposed for pan-Latin communication in 1991 (see Romano, further down).  Sample text in Lingua Romana  = Neolatino (√òrberg) = Neolatino is a Romance zonal constructed language intended to be used as a global international auxiliary language. It was developed by Danish Latinist Hans Henning √òrberg (1920-2010), known for his method for learning Latin, Lingua Latina per se Illustrata, first published in 1955. All the information available on this Neolatino is offered by the developer of another pan-Romance language, Campos Lima, who mentions it and publishes a letter that √òrberg had sent him in 1941.Campos Lima (1948), p. 17-19 In this letter, √òrberg explains that he has started to work on a new international language, which he calls Neolatino, based on the Romance languages only and without artificial elements. According to Campos Lima, it had nominal agreement in gender and number and verbal personal inflexion, with more irregularities than Campos Lima's own pan-Romance language 'internacional' (see below); but √òrberg didn't publish his project and by 1947 had abandoned it in favour of a more simplified and regularized language. = Neolatino (Schild) = Petite Grammaire Neolatine, by Schild (1947), front page. NeolatinoMonnerot-Dumaine (1960) is a Romance zonal constructed language proposed to be used as a global international auxiliary language. It was developed by francophone Swiss linguist Andr√© Schild (1910-1981), who presented it in Petite Grammaire Neolatine,Schild (1947a) published in January 1947. This first work includes grammar, vocabulary and sample texts. An international group of supporters was founded shortly after, which published in Neolatino a bulletin with texts from several authors (Buletino del Grupo Internacionale Neolatinista de Correspondentes) from May 1947 until, at least, February 1949 (18 numbers).Andr√© Schild (ed.) (1947-1949). Buletino del Grupo Internacionale Neolatinista de Corespondentes. Basilea. 18 numbers, at least. https://drive.google.com/open?id=155P1CVqYYoUhwuAVcaUHmTb2KVGoCi62 Later in 1947, Schild published an extended dictionary in Vocabulario Neolatino: Francese-Italiano-Hispano.Schild (1947b) In 1948, a group improved and further developed the language: Comitato Lingu√≠stico Neolatino, with Schild as its president. R. L. Stevenson's tale Will o' the mill: The plain and the stars was translated into Neolatino by H. Littlewood as Gulielmo del molino: La planura e las stelas.  Sample text in Neolatino  = Internacional = Internacional (or 'lingua internacional') is a Romance zonal constructed language proposed to be used as a global international auxiliary language. It was developed by Portuguese lawyerCampos Lima was not only a lawyer, but also a journalist, poet, translator, political activist, interlinguist and editor. Jo√£o Evangelista Campos Lima (1887-1956), who presented it in Gram√°tica internacional, published in 1948. Gramatica Internacional, by Campos Lima (1948), pages 2-3.  Sample text in Internacional  = Romano = RomanoRadaelli (2016) p. 59 is the result of the codification of Stefan George's Lingua Romana, a Romance artistic language which the German poet used in part of his lyrical work (see above). This codification is known though Grammatica de la lingua Romana de Stefan George (1991), an anonymous manuscript preserved at the Sammlung f√ºr Plansprachen in Vienna.Anonymous (1991) Romano is proposed to be used as a regional international auxiliary language for the Latin world.  Sample text in Romano   Pan-Romance languages in the 21st century  = Interlingua Romanica = Interlingua Romanica (or simply 'Romanica') is a Romance zonal constructed language proposed to be used as a regional international auxiliary language for the Latin world. It is a reformed version of the constructed international auxiliary language Interlingua and was developed in 2001 by the English- speaking Canadian interlingualist Richard Sorfleet and the Spanish- and Basque-speaking Basque school teacher Josu Lavin. They presented it on the internet that same year on Latinity's Day (the 15th of May, a celebration established by the Latin Union). Old GeoCities site on Interlingua Romanica, fragment of the main page (http://www.geocities.com/linguaromanica/) captured in 2009. The original Interlingua's grammar was presented by Gode and Blair in 1951 as \\"A Proposed Grammatical System for the International Language\\" but it has since been used generally by the interlinguistic community. Fifty years later, Sorfleet and Lavin proposed for Interlingua a new grammar, which incorporates some typical Romance features that are missing in traditional Interlingua: nominal agreement, verbal personal inflexion, etc. As a result, Interlingua Romanica shares vocabulary with Interlingua (with minor modifications) but proposes a more Romance grammar. This Romance version of the grammar isn't intended to replace the previous simple one, but is thought as a variant which Romance speakers can use if they regard the traditional one too unnatural. According to the developers, it could increase Romance speakers' interest in Interlingua and it shouldn't be an obstacle for someone who already knows Interlingua with its traditional grammar. Interlingua Romanica has been abandoned by its proponents (the last one, Lavin, in 2008), but has still a small community of users and continues to attract interest of new people, often through Interlingua. A Facebook group with 175 members (October 2019) and several internet pages are devoted to Interlingua Romanica. There are other proposals to reform Interlingua. A slightly older project is Latino Moderne by David Th. Stark (1996), which includes verbal personal inflection but not nominal agreement. Another project is Latino Moderne by Alexandre Rousset (2001), which does not modify Interlingua's grammar but its vocabulary. They have both failed to build a community, but the former one has attracted attention. In any case, unlike Interlingua Romanica, these two projects cannot be considered pan-Romance, as they lack some typical Romance grammatical features.  Sample text in Interlingua Romanica  Version in Interlingua: = Romance Neolatino = Language families in Europe Romance Neolatino (or simply 'Neolatino')Palmiotta (2019)Rinc√≥n Botero (2016) is a pan-Romance language proposed as a standard language for Romance as a whole, to ease communication amongst or with speakers of Romance languages, complementing (not substituting) the standards that exist locally (Portuguese, Spanish, etc.). In addition to its intended role in the Latin world, Romance Neolatino is proposed to build an alternative language policy for Europe in combination with interlanguages for other language families (like Interslavic).Cassany Bates (2019a)Cassany Bates (2019d) This standard language was started in 2006 by Romance scholar Jordi Cassany Bates and is now developed and promoted by a collective, international and interdisciplinary project called V√≠a Neolatina, which gathers linguists and other professionals from different Latin countries. A basic grammar and dictionary have been published in 2019: Grammatica Essentiale NeolatinaCassany Bates (2019b) and Dictionario Essentiale Neolatino,Cassany Bates (2019c) which reform some aspects of a preliminary model published in 2012.Cassany Bates (2012) A first group of students is learning the language through a Facebook group, with over 50 members. A Facebook page with over 500 followers (October 2019) and several other internet pages are devoted to Romance Neolatino, including two blogs: Mondo Neolatino, by Cassany, and Lo esp√†zio, by Mart√≠n Rinc√≥n Botero. These two authors have also used the language orally, including a presentation of the project by Cassany at the University of Hamburg (2017). The project has also been presented in the University of Barcelona (2011), the University of Kiel (2017) and at the 1st. Conference on Interslavic Language (2017, at Star√© Mƒõsto, Czechia).  Design principles  The linguists of V√≠a Neolatina intend to design or codify a pan-Romance standard in a scientific way, and to do so they pay special attention to its design principles (including values, goals, methodology, etc.). The design principles developed by V√≠a NeolatinaCassany Bates (2017) are based on applied linguistics' theoretical contributions; codifications for particular Romance languages (Grisons Romansh, Occitan, Catalan, Galician, etc.) which experts have designed; other interlanguages, both Romance and of other families (like Interslavic); and the experience of its members with Neolatin. The developed methodology takes into account various criteria for the selection of forms. Each of the criteria is a positive quality of standard languages in general: forms should ideally be intelligible, used by the majority, encompassing, regular, traditional, concise, etc. They add up to more than 20 linguistic and extralinguistic criteria, all treated equally in the present version of the methodology. When no form is clearly positive in more ways than other forms, the methodology provides the codifiers with some resources: compositionality (inclusion of elements from different varieties), polymorphism (inclusion of options from which the user can choose), centrality (priorization of forms from geographically central varieties), innovation (creation of neologisms and new analogies, but strictly avoiding artificiality), etc. All this is done with the intention of developing a language model which is more easily acceptable by the potential users and more effective for communication.  Sample text in Romance Neolatino  = Latino Interromanico = Latino Interromanico (or simply 'Interromance' in English, or 'Interromanico' in the language itself) is a Romance zonal constructed language proposed to be used as a regional international auxiliary language for the Latin world. It was started in 2017 by European (German-Romanian) programmer Raymund Zacharias, who published an outline of the language in an internet site devoted to the project. Zacharias intends Interromanico to be used as a bridge to the Romance languages, that is as a didactic resource or strategy, but also as a communication tool. In order to achieve that and mimic the mappings of form and meaning for words and word parts as found in the Romance languages, their etymology is traced to common roots (most often Latin, but also Greek and others). These base forms by default then only receive a minimal adjustment to adhere to the grammar and spelling of Interromance. In order to produce text or speech that is as universally understood as possible, the words and word parts are checked to have as many cognates as possible within the different Romance linguistic variety groups. Flavorizations are possible in order to increase the comprehension to specific target groups or to indicate certain trends. Since 2019, Interromanico has received another definition in Grammatica dello Latino InterromanicoSanctus (2019) by Brazilian Thiago Sanctus, who intends it to be used as a more complete reference for acquiring knowledge of the language. A Facebook group and an active WhatsApp group with ca. 45 members (October 2019) are devoted to Latino Interromanico.  Sample text in Latino Interromanico   Relationship with other Romance-based languages  Pan-Romance languages and other Romance-based languages can be similar. The later are mostly constructed a posteriori languages that resemble Romance, mainly because of their vocabulary, but lack some typical, generally grammatical, Romance features, which pan-Romance languages do include. Mediterranean Lingua Franca was not a constructed language but a pidgin. = Partially Romance-based constructed languages = There are many constructed a posteriori languages which integrate elements from different, typically European, language families but have a very Romance or even Latin appearance because they are based on international vocabulary, that is, words which are common to the most internationally influential European languages. This vocabulary is mainly of Latin origin due to the century-long influence of this language over European languages. They have been called Latinid constructed languages by Blanke,Blanke (2006), p. 42 and include Esperanto,Blanke (2006), p. 89 Ido, Interlingue, Interlingua, Rom√°ni√ßo, etc. Some are schematic, others are naturalistic constructed languages. Naturalistic Latinid languages, due to their proximity to Romance languages, have been called Neolatinid languages by Carlevaro.Carlevaro (2/1980), reported by Blanke (1985), p. 157 Interlingua is the most notable naturalistic language of the group. The linguists at the International Auxiliary Language Association who developed the language from 1937 to 1951 based it on international vocabulary and, as a result, it has a very Latin or even Romance appearance. Nevertheless, Interlingua grammar lacks some important Romance features. Because it is intended as a global international auxiliary language, its authors (Alexander Gode and Hugh BlairGode, Blair (1951)) avoided what they considered unnecessary Romance complications which would be difficult to learn (or understand) by non Romance speakers. Thus, they developed a simple grammatical system inspired by English (a Germanic language) which is not representative of Romance. It lacks, for example, nominal agreement or verbal personal inflection, which is a common trait of the major Romance languages (Portuguese, Spanish, Catalan, French, Italian, Romanian, etc.). Similarly, Interlingue (known as Occidental until 1949) was described by its developer Edgar de Wahl as \\"not a Romance but a Latinesque language\\", because in spite of its vocabulary -which gives it \\"a big similarity with Romance languages\\"- its grammar (and mainly its syntax) are \\"absolutely not Romance\\", but based on other European languages. As a result, Occidental is \\"much more European, more Anglo-Germano-Slavic by spirit\\". There is no clear border between pan-Romance languages and some of these Romance-based constructed languages. For example, Schild's Neolatino (see above), intended as a global international auxiliary language, includes the Greek-based preposition pri, which the developer considered practical to avoid confusions. Nevertheless, the language can be considered, according to Schild, a synthesis of the Romance languages even if this consideration is not completely adequate.Schild (1948a) It has been presented above among the pan- Romance languages, also because Campos Lima considered it a dialect of he's own pan-Romance project. Another project that lies on the border is Interlingua Romanica (see above), as it's a reform of Interlingua, which is based not only on Romance languages (Portuguese, Spanish, French and Italian) but also on English and, to a lesser extent, German and Russian.Gode (1951), Introduction: Source or Control Languages = Romance-based constructed languages = There are some constructed a posteriori languages which do not integrate elements from languages families other than Romance but are still not representative of Romance as a whole. This difference arises because, for example, they are also based on Romance creole languages, or their developers have strongly simplified or modified in other ways the Romance basis. They include Romanid, Lingua Franca Nova, Panlatino by William Angel de MelloMello (2002) and Romanova, among others. Lingua Franca Nova, created by C. George Boeree (1998), bases its lexicon on five major Romance languages (Portuguese, Spanish, Catalan, French and Italian) and its simple grammar on Romance creole languages. According to the main site of the project,http://elefen.org/introdui/en.html Retrieved 15 October 2019 \\"It is designed to seem relatively ‚Äúnatural‚Äù to those who are familiar with Romance languages, without being any more difficult for others to learn.\\" Sample text in Lingua Franca Nova: There is no clear border between pan-Romance languages and some of these other Romance-based constructed languages. For example, Romanova lacks verbal personal inflexion, but nominal agreement is optional. As a result, it can seem a pan-Romance language when the subject of the sentences is the third person. Sample text in Romanova: On the other side, George's Lingua Romana has elements of Italian and (Vulgar) Latin, but is closest to Spanish,Radaelli (2016), p. 62 so it's not so representative of Romance as a whole. Nevertheless, it is not a simple version of Spanish.Radaelli (2016), p. 63. In spite of George's Lingua Romana's tendecy towards Spanish, Radaelli considers it a mixed Romance language: \\"Doch George bildet, indem er vor allem auf der phonologischer Ebene Spanisch mit Italienisch bzw. (Vulg√§r-)Latein kombiniert, eine romanische Mischsprache.\\" It has been presented above among the pan-Romance languages because other pan- Romance developers have regarded the project as close and George as a forefather.Schild (1948b), p. 2: \\"Es por nos interessante constatar que George ha potito scriber a priori una lingua tanto pr√≥xima al neolatino. Forse solo la mancancia de experiencia interlingu√≠stica lo ha impedito dar a sua lingua una structura gramaticale.\\" = Latin-based constructed languages = Romance- based constructed languages can be also difficult to distinguish from Latin- based constructed languages,Libert (2004), p. 1: \\"There are some artificial languages which are based on one or more Romance languages, and in some sense these could also be considered artificial descendants of Latin, but one would not say that they are consciously based on Latin, and I have not dealt with them.\\" like Latino sine flexione. There are many proposals, typically intended as international auxiliary languages. An early project was Weltsprache, by A. Volk ed R. Fuchs (1883).Libert (2004) Sample text in Latino sine flexione:A project that lies on the border is Latino Interromanico (see above), which is presented as a \\"Latin-Romance language\\".Sanctus (2019), p. 19.

Wolff received in 1916 a bachelor's degree in physics from Dartmouth College and in 1923 a doctorate in physics from Cornell University and then became a Research Fellow there. In 1924 he joined the RCA Technical and Test Laboratory at 7 Van Cortlandt Park South in New York City. In 1930 he was transferred to the RCA Research Department in Camden, New Jersey and became head of the Acoustic Research Department of the merged RCA-Victor Company. From 1924 to 1931 he did research on acoustics. He initiated in 1932 a program of microwave research and in 1934 a program of radar research. In 1946 he was appointed director of RCA's Radio Tube Research Laboratory. In 1951 he was appointed director of research of the RCA Laboratories in Princeton and in 1954 was promoted to vice president of research. He retired from RCA in 1959 and continued to live in Princeton until his death in 1982. In 1934 Wolff and his team from the research staff from the RCA-Victor Company demonstrated prototype radar equipment to the United States Army Signal Corps at Atlantic Highlands, New Jersey. Using reflected 9-centimeter radio waves, the RCA team located and followed the progress of a ship entering New York Harbor about a half mile (.8 kilometer) away. This experiment may have been the first successful demonstration in the United States of microwave radar. In 1946 Wolff and colleagues at RCA developed the basis for the Teleran System of Air Navigation for aircraft guidance and air traffic control. In 1949 the U.S. Navy awarded him the highest civilian Navy award ‚Äî the Distinguished Public Service Award. Dr. Wolff held over 80 patents and made important contributions not only to microwave radar but also loudspeaker acoustics, infrared detection, and radio frequency heating. Upon his death he was survived by his widow, a daughter, and two grandchildren.

The Jamaican Labor Party and the People's National Party have fought for control of the island for years and the rivalry has encouraged urban warfare in Kingston. Each side believes the other to be controlled by foreign elements, the JLP is said to be backed by the American Central Intelligence Agency and the PNP is said to have been backed by the Soviet Union and Fidel Castro. History =Pre-Independence beginnings= By 1943 the JLP and PNP had established themselves as Jamaica's main rival political parties coming out of the recent Caribbean labour unrest. After the election of 1944 violence became a common aspect of their rivalry. Alexander Bustamante began to encourage the attack of PNP sympathizers, claiming they were communists. Alexander Bustamante also started to specifically cater to his political constituents, such as offering migrant work visas specifically along political lines that favoured him. =Formation of garrisons= Jamaica gained independence in 1962, and by 1963 political parties were paying off members of the Rude boy subculture to engage in turf warfare with political rivals. Once the JLP would come to power they would demolish a PNP sympathising slum and construct Tivoli Gardens in its place, starting in 1965. The project would be monitored by Edward Seaga and Tivoli Gardents would be a JLP garrison, and the PNP would react by forming its own garrisons solidifying the tradition of violent garrison communities in Jamaica. By the 1966 election gunfights became common, bombings occurred, and police would be routinely shot at. This resulted in more than 500 people injured, 20 people dead, and 500 arrested during police raids. =Escalation of political violence= Sporadic political violence would evolve into outright urban warfare after a series of violent outbursts. The Henry rebellion, the Coral Gardens incident, the anti-Chinese riots of 1965, the state of emergency of 1966-67, and finally the Rodney riots. These events were the beginnings of an ethnic nationalist element to Jamaican politics and a further normalisation of political violence in general in Jamaican society Political violence had become commonplace in Jamaica. Political parties began paying off crime bosses for local gang support. Assassination threats and attempts also starting becoming more frequent. By 1974 the PNP openly avowed their support for the principles of democratic socialism. PNP candidate Michael Manley began public praises of Fidel Castro. The JLP emerged as a right wing counter to this new emerging leftism. The Central Intelligence Agency began supplying weapons to JLP vigilantes. By the 1976 election over a hundred had been murdered during the conflict and political parties began forming paramilitary divisions. In 1978 five JLP supporters were massacred by official Jamaican soldiers. Reggae music became a voice for peace in the country and the landmark One Love Peace Concert was held in hopes of peace. By the 1980 election 844 people were murdered in political violence preceding the vote. =Involvement in the drug trade= By the 1980s the JLP gained control of the country and embraced neo-liberal policies. Gangs began to be unsatisfied with the lessening handouts given by their political leaders and due to DEA campaigns turned away from marijuana smuggling and to the cocaine trade. Newly enriched these gangs began to be more involved in governing the garrison communities they controlled. The JLP aligned gang Shower Posse was one of these newly enriched gangs. The CIA provided Shower Posse with arms, training, and transport to the United States. =2010 Kingston unrest= After international pressure the Jamaican government agreed to arrest extradite famed gang leader Christopher Coke. Some in the Jamaican media speculated that the long time it took to arrest Coke came from Prime Minister Bruce Golding's political assistance he received from Coke. During the raids and attempts to arrest Coke violent gunfights would break out throughout Kingston by his allies to prevent his capture. =Recent developments= Despite many peace accords it is still common for political parties to pay off criminals for support and encourage paramilitary garrisons. Garrison communities Garrison constituencies in Jamaica are housing developments erected by the government who house carefully selected residents that will wholly support a local politician. As of 2001 about 15 hardcore garrison communities exist in Jamaica. The residents of garrisons form vigilante groups that engage in ongoing political turf wars. Originally these groups were solely politically motivated but eventually they all came to be invested in the drug trade and became what are known as Jamaican posses. These posses are well armed, often equipped with assault rifles and grenade launchers. Since the 1980s these posses have participated more in the drug trade and relied less on politicians to arm them. Now about 80% of their weapons arrive from South Florida, while other weapons and armour appear to be police issued - suggesting that corrupt police officials are trading them with the posses.

At the time, he was using the pseudonym \\"Leonid\\", a slavic name, like many other Crimean Tatars in the Soviet military, including Fetislyam \\"Anatoly\\" Abilov and Emir \\"Ivan Kirillovich\\" Chalbash.  Early life  Velilayev was born in 1919 to a Crimean Tatar peasant family in the rural village of Akmonai. After completing seven grades of school in 1928 he had an apprenticeship at a factory and later worked at a metallurgical plant in Kerch until entering the Red Army in 1937; he was soon deployed to fight in the Soviet-Finnish war.  World War II  Velilayev was assigned to the 140th Guards Infantry Regiment during the German-Soviet war; he saw combat in the Battle of Stalingrad and later in advances across Eastern and Central Europe. He was awarded his first Order of Glory in 1944 for his actions as assistant platoon commander in the village of Olshanka, Ukraine, in which he was wounded while he led an attack on enemy defensive positions that resulted in the deaths of 13 enemy soldiers and three firing positions. He was later awarded the Medal for Courage for leading a successful attack on the western bank of the Vistula river that eliminated 20 enemy soldiers. On 8 February 1945 he was awarded the Order of Glory 2nd class for having personally captured a German officer in the Warsaw offensive after storming an enemy trench. During heavy street fighting in the Battle of Berlin on 1 May 1945 Velilayev took command of his platoon and led an advance, in which they destroyed four machine gun points and killed 18 enemy soldiers. For doing so he was awarded the Order of Glory 1st class at the Kremlin on 15 May 1945. He was demobilized from the military in January 1948.  Later life  Velilayev, having taken on the Slavic name of Leonid, was one of the very few Crimean Tatars who was not deported to Central Asia in the S√ºrg√ºn. He lived out the remainder of his life in mainland Ukraine, first in Donetsk and later in Antratsyt. He died at the age of 81 on 27 December 1997.

Etymology There are three constituents of the village's name. The first, \\"umm\\", is Arabic for mother, and is a common prefix in Qatar when preceding a geographical description. \\"Daah\\" is the local name for a shrub, Latin name Lasiurus hirsutus, that grows abundantly in the area.

Finally, the village derived the name \\"Khawzan\\" from a local depression called Rawdat Khawzan. In Arabic, \\"khazan\\" roughly means \\"reservoir\\". The depression was an important water reservoir for nearby settlements, being capable of storing water for months after rainy season.

The celebration is always on October 13, the day the Continental Congress passed a resolution to establish a navy in 1775. In 2018, the 243rd birthday is scheduled for the Ronald Reagan Building and International Trade Center in Washington, D.C.  History  The founding of the U.S. Navy dates back to the Revolutionary War. George Washington created the United States' first naval fleet by converting three Massachusetts schooners into warships. The makeshift fleet's purpose was to intercept an unarmed British supply ship. The next day, Washington sent a letter to Congress urging them to establish a naval force. On October 13, the Continental Congress passed a resolution in order to create the Continental Navy. This date now represents the official establishment of the U.S. Navy. In 1972, the Chief of Naval Operations Elmo Zumwalt designated October 13 as the Navy's official birthday, in order \\"to enhance a greater appreciation of our Navy heritage, and to provide a positive influence toward pride and professionalism in the naval service.\\" Since then each CNO has encouraged and celebrated the Navy's birthday.  Celebration  In contrast with Navy Day, the Navy's Birthday is an internal activity for members of the active forces and reserves, as well as retirees and dependents.  Navy Ball  Each year, NLUS hosts a ball and ceremony in the Washington D.C. capital region. The Chief of Naval Operations sends out invites to a wide variety of officials and officers such as the Secretary of Defense, Secretary of the Navy, Chief of Staff of the Army, Chief of Staff of the Air Force, Commandant of the Marine Corps, Commandant of the Coast Guard, the former CNO, etc. NLUS schedules the evening around a keynote speech, dinner and desserts, cake cutting ceremony, official toasts from high level officers, and musical performances.

The story was six pages long, pages three through eight. The second story was four pages long, pages nine through twelve. The frontispiece consisted of a drawing of Wolfstein confronted by a skeleton struck by lightning. He stands over the corpse of Serena. The drawing is a more condensed version of the 1822 frontispiece. The caption reads: \\"Deeper grew the gloom of the cavern, and darkness seemed to press around him. Suddenly a flash of lightning burst through the cavern, followed by thunder that appeared to convulse the universal fabric of nature; and borne on the sulphurous blast, the Prince of Terrors stood before him.\\" Plot Summary Frontispiece.The chapbook follows the plot of the first section of the novel St. Irvyne on the bandits but omits the second part featuring Frederic Nempere in Geneva. The account is radically condensed. The name of Cavigni, leader of the bandits, is changed to Stiletto. The name of Megalena is changed to Serena. The character of Ginotti, the Rosicrucian alchemist, does not appear. The opening scene is of a raging thunderstorm. Wolfstein is a wanderer in the Swiss Alps who seeks cover from the storm. He is a distraught outcast who plans to commit suicide. A group of monks carrying a body for burial in a torch-light procession runs into him and saves his life. Bandits then attack them. Wolfstein is accepted as a member of the bandits. He becomes used to a life of crime. But a rivalry develops between him and Stilleto over Serena. He decides to poison the chief by secretly placing a white powder in his wine. Stiletto drinks the poison and dies. Wolfstein is subsequently elected Captain by the other bandits after the murder of Stiletto. He then is racked by dreams of the murdered Cavigni which fill him with dread and foreboding. Days after the murder, Wolfstein seeks to seduce Serena. He observes her in prayer. She refuses his advances and pulls out a dagger. In response, Wolfstein unsheaths his sword and stabs her to death. Thunder was heard in the cell. The Prince of Terror then appeared before him. A ‚Äústrange and unnatural stench‚Äù infused the room as ‚Äúthe yawning gulf of hell‚Äù swallowed Wolfstein as blue flames swirled around his body. The final paragraph concludes with a moral of the story. Plunging into despair and indulging in crime are not the ways to confront misfortune. The tenets of morality and truth should be diligently followed. Only ‚Äúmisery, disgrace and ruin‚Äù result when these principles are ignored. References Sources *Behrendt, Stephen C.

This worm occurs in the northeastern Atlantic Ocean. Description Nephasoma rimicola grows to a maximum length of about . Like all peanut worms it has a cylindrical trunk and a narrower, retractable anterior section known as the introvert. The mouth is at the end of the introvert which can be extended to feed or retracted into the body at other times. In this species the trunk is about three times as long as it is wide with the introvert being a similar length. The introvert is retracted by a single, ventral pair of retractor muscles. Near its tip, the introvert has many hook-like spines arranged in six to ten rings, and the mouth is surrounded by well-formed tentacles; there are eight of these in juveniles but more develop as the worm grows, with sixteen being present in most adults and twenty in the largest individuals. The rings of hooked spines and the well- developed tentacles help to distinguish this species from the usually much smaller Nephasoma minutum which occupies similar habitats. Distribution Nephasoma rimicola occurs in the northeastern Atlantic Ocean. It has been found in northern Spain and in several shallow water locations around the British Isles, including west of the Isle of Wight, the estuary of the River Exe in north Devon and Milford Haven in south Pembrokeshire where it inhabits crevices in the rock. It also occurs off the coast of southern Spain in deeper water, between . Ecology Peanut worms are detritivores. The introvert is extended along the surface of the substrate and organic particles are gathered by the oral tentacles and moved to the mouth when the introvert is drawn in. The gut is long and J-shaped, with the anus on the dorsal surface of the front end of the trunk. The introvert is normally kept retracted except when the worm is feeding.

The publication had received early stage investments from the IPS Media Foundation, the Media Development Investment Fund and the investment firm of Omidyar Network, following an endorsement from the law firm Khaitan & Co. In June 2014, Atlantic Media partnered with the Scroll Media Inc to launch the Indian edition of the business news brand Quartz. In the following year, the Hindi media publishing company Satyagrah was merged with Scroll Media and became the Hindi edition of Scroll.in which continues to operate under the name of Satyagrah. Sanjay Dubey who was the founder and editor of Satyagrah and previously the editor of Tehelka's Hindi edition, remained as the editor of Satyagrah. In March 2018, the publication partially shifted towards a subscription business model providing ad free delivery of news service and access to archives for subscribers. Naresh Fernandes, the editor-in-chief however stated that the publication will not implement any paywalls. In December 2018, Deutsche Welle partnered with Scroll.in to launch its Indian weekly programme, Eco India as part of DW's venture into the South Asian media industry. Between May‚ÄìJune 2019, Scroll.in laid off a number of editorial staff citing a restructuring of the business model.  Organisation  The Scroll's staff are segregated into two divisions; the editorial team and the distribution team. In an article of the Columbia Journalism Review, the segregation was explained as the result of caution associated with the \\"credibility of digital media\\" prevalent among the former print medium journalists who constituted the editorial team of the new publication. The editorial team in addition consists of an appointed ombudsman for additional editorial oversight. Naresh Fernandes is the current editor-in-chief of the website. The Hindi edition of the publication, Satyagrah has a separate editorial team with Sanjay Dubey as the editor-in-chief. The distribution team of the publication is staffed with analysts of social media and search result algorithm who manage the distribution assets of the publication.  Content  According to a report of the Reuters Institute for the Study of Journalism, the content delivery of the Scroll.in resembles that of a news wire in combination with in-depth reporting and commentary pieces; the site was described to be elite oriented and compared with the Quartz (publication). Per the report, the publication's content is targeted towards an up-market audience with the business strategy of generating income through premium native advertising and e-commerce. The report also described the publication to have developed a simple and responsive design for its website for the purpose of easy accessibility.  Products  Besides the primary website, the distribution of Scroll's content is provided through internet assets such as an android app, two email newsletters and an array of social media channels across Facebook, Twitter, Instagram and YouTube. The Scroll also operates an online shop for books and literary accessories based on recommendations from the editorial team.

For more than forty years, Berger was affiliated with the Institute of Jazz Studies at Rutgers University. He was also a longtime friend and business associate of the jazz instrumentalist and composer Benny Carter.  Early life  Berger was the eldest of three sons born to Morroe and Paula Berger. Berger grew up in New Jersey, where his father was a professor of sociology at Princeton University. In addition to his specialization in Near East studies, Morroe Berger was also an expert in jazz, and it was through Morroe that Ed received his earliest exposure to the music that would become his life's focus.Schoenberg, Loren, ‚ÄúInterview with Ed Berger‚Äù WRHU (August 13, 2014). In 1970, Berger received a bachelor's degree from Indiana University, with a double major in Slavic Languages and Near Eastern Languages. After additional graduate studies in Slavic Languages at Princeton University, Berger went on to receive a Master of Library and Information Science in 1975 from Rutgers University‚Äôs Graduate School of Library Science.Berger, Ed. \\"Resume\\" from the Ed Berger Photographic Collection, Oberlin Conservatory Library special collections.  Institute of Jazz Studies  His professional career began the following year when Berger was hired as a curator at the Institute of Jazz Studies. He held that position from 1976 until 1987, when he was promoted to Assistant Director of the Institute. He was again promoted to Associate Director in 1995; a position he held until his retirement in 2011. While at IJS, Berger coordinated the acquisition of a number of significant collections, including those of Abbey Lincoln, Benny Goodman, James P. Johnson, Benny Carter, Teo Macero, George Duvivier, and many others. Notably, he was instrumental in the acquisition of the Harold Flakser Collection, which is among the largest single collections of jazz periodicals in existence. Berger played a key role in enhancing access to materials in the IJS, including major work in the early 2000s transitioning the archive from analog to digital access interfaces. In addition to his day-to-day work overseeing staff and reference services for this major repository, Berger also served as project director for more than a dozen grant-funded projects at IJS, with combined budgets totaling over one million dollars. After his retirement from Rutgers in 2011, he maintained his association with IJS, working as a special projects consultant until 2017. From 1995 to 2011 Berger coordinated the monthly Jazz Research Roundtable program at IJS. Under his direction, the series brought leading jazz scholars and musicians to the institute to further jazz research and education. Visiting presenters included Gary Giddins, Richard Sudhalter, Stanley Crouch, Robin D.G. Kelley, Joe Wilder, Randy Sandke, Lara Pellegrinelli, and David Hajdu.  Author and editor  In 1979, Berger contributed to his first published monograph, working with Charles Nanry on the book The Jazz Text (New York: Van Nostrand, 1979). He wrote biographical sketches of a number of major jazz figures and also authored the chapter \\"A Student's Guide to Jazz Research.\\" In 1982, in collaboration with Morroe Berger and James Patrick, Berger published the two volume biography and discography Benny Carter: A Life in American Music (Metuchen, NJ: Scarecrow Press, 1982). Berger wrote portions of the biography, authored the entirety of volume two which is an annotated discography of Carter, and, after Morroe Berger's death in 1981, edited the work and saw it through publication. He updated and expanded both volumes for a second edition published in 2002. In 1990, Berger collaborated with Teddy Reig to publish Reig's autobiography Reminiscing in Tempo: The Life and Times of a Jazz Hustler (Metuchen, NJ: Scarecrow Press, 1990), and in 1993 he wrote and compiled the monograph Bassically Speaking: An Oral History of George Duvivier (Metuchen, NJ: Scarecrow Press, 1993). Berger's final book, Softly, With Feeling: Joe Wilder and the Breaking of Barriers in American Music (Philadelphia: Temple University Press, 2014), received the Association for Recorded Sound Collections' 2015 Award for Best Historical Research in Recorded Jazz. In addition to his books, Berger authored more than fifty book chapters, articles, and book reviews on jazz history and discography. He also authored over sixty sets of liner notes and concert notes for various jazz recordings and performances. Berger was also an accomplished editor, serving as the co-editor for the series Scarecrow Press Studies in Jazz from 1982-2010, during which time he solicited, evaluated, and edited more than seventy monographs covering jazz biography, discography, musicology, and history. From 1987-2017 Berger co-edited the peer-reviewed Journal of Jazz Studies/Annual Review of Jazz Studies, which in 2011 became an online, open- access publication. Loren Schoenberg, one of the many writers whose work Berger edited, summarized their interaction: ‚ÄúI was honored to be among the many authors that Ed lent his editorial expertise to. His patience, expertise, and especially his humor managed to bring out things that I would never have thought of his without his instigation. He was truly a master at helping others express themselves.‚Äù  Radio host  While working at the IJS, Berger co-hosted a weekly radio program titled ‚ÄúJazz from the Archives‚Äù on WBGO in Newark, NJ from 1979 to 2014. Berger produced and hosted over 200 interview- based programs with musicians including Jimmy Heath, Milt Hinton, Marian McPartland, Dizzy Reece, Kenny Washington, and Phil Woods. He also hosted another weekly radio program titled \\"Jazz Spectrum,\\" on WWFM in Trenton, NJ from 1985 to 1987. Berger's experience conducting interviews also included multi-hour oral histories with Dan Morgenstern, Grachan Moncur III, Joe Wilder, Benny Carter, Harry Edison, Marshal Royal, Ray Bryant, George Duvivier, and Teddy Reig.  Educator  Berger was active as a teacher and lecturer throughout his life. He began offering jazz history courses at Rutgers University in 1983, and beginning in 1998 he taught in the Graduate Program in Jazz History and Research. Over the years, he offered a number of courses on topics including Benny Carter, Joe Wilder, and discography at Jazz at Lincoln Center's Swing University, and he presented regularly at regional and national jazz research and library conferences from the 1970s through the 2010s.  Benny Carter  One of Berger's longest and most significant relationships was his friendship and business association with Benny Carter. Berger first met Carter in the early 1970s, when Berger's father Morroe began his work on Carter's biography. In 1981, Carter hired Berger as the road manager for the Benny Carter Orchestra, a position he would keep for almost twenty years. In this role, Berger coordinated nearly a dozen tours of Japan and Thailand as well as major domestic concerts including the Presidential Inaugural Ball in 1985. In 1987, Carter asked Berger to produce his recordings, and he went on to work with Carter on nearly twenty recordings, including two Grammy Award winners: Harlem Renaissance (MusicMasters 65080; 1992) and Elegy in Blue (MusicMasters 65115; 1994). In 1992 he and Carter founded Evening Star Records, which released fifteen albums, including works by Joe Wilder, Phil Woods, Randy Sandke, and Bill Kirchner. When Carter died on July 12, 2003, Berger coordinated a major memorial service at St. Peter's Church in NYC and contributed to an additional service in Los Angeles. As Berger noted, ‚ÄúBenny was like a second father to me.‚Äù Berger remained in close contact with Hilma Carter, Benny's window. The Berger/Carter relationship lives on, in part, through the Morroe Berger ‚Äì Benny Carter ‚Äì Edward Berger Jazz Research Fund endowment established in 1987 (Ed's name was added in 2017). Annually, the Institute of Jazz Studies awards these grants to a select number of researchers working in jazz history, musicology, bibliography, and discography.  Record producer and label owner  Berger produced over forty jazz recordings beginning in the early 1980s, when he first worked with Dan Morgenstern on the 100-LP set Franklin Mint-Greatest Jazz Recordings of All Time from 1982-1986. In addition to his work with Carter, Berger produced dozens of original recordings and compilations including George Shearing, Lionel Hampton, Dizzy Gillespie, Ella Fitzgerald, Count Basie, Joe Wilder, Coleman Hawkins, Ben Webster, and Ray Bryant.  Photographer  Berger began taking photographs at an early age and continued the work for the rest of his life, taking tens of thousands of photographs from the 1960s through 2016. Over the course of five decades, Berger documented the entire spectrum of jazz, capturing candid moments and formal portraits of hundreds of its giants. As a result of his long history with Benny Carter, Berger was able to take thousands of photographs of Carter across several decades. Berger was a regular contributing photographer to Jazz Times from 2001-2017, and he did additional freelance photography for periodicals including Down Beat, Jazz Journal, Cadence, the New York Times, Allegro, Washington Star, American Rag, Annual Review of Jazz Studies, and Musical Heritage Review. He also did event photography and photographic restoration work for the National Jazz Museum in Harlem beginning in 2002. His photographs have been published in the liner notes for more than forty jazz recordings, and his work has been included in a number of photographic exhibitions at the Dana Library at Rutgers University, WBGO Studios in Newark, the Sherman Library in Connecticut, and the National Jazz Museum in Harlem. Berger photographed events including jazz rehearsals and concerts, memorials and tributes, festivals, museum openings and gallery exhibitions, and a variety of lectures and educational events. Berger took the photographs on stage, in offices and classrooms, and at homes, representing an extensive range of venues associated with a life in jazz. In 2017 the Oberlin Conservatory Library received Berger's photographs and organized them into the Ed Berger Photographic Collection.  Awards and legacy  In addition to his two Grammy Awards and the ARSC award for Best Research in Recorded Jazz Music, Berger also received the Rutgers University President's Award for Excellence in Administration (1990), the Rutgers University Administrative Merit Award (1988, 1989, 1993, 1994,1999), and the New Jersey Jazz Society Award honoring his lifetime of contributions to the music (2008). Despite his many awards and accolades, Berger was regularly noted by friends and colleagues for his humility, modesty, and lack of interest in being in the spotlight. While his photographic portraits were treasured by those subjects he captured, he regularly donated his photographic services for organizations including the Jazz House Kids in Montclair, NJ, and the Global Communities of Support, which assisted individuals with autism and other developmental disabilities. Ed was devoted to his two nephews, whom he helped raise, and was a legendary pick-up basketball player for over five decades and countless injuries. As Benny Carter put it, ‚ÄúEd's quite unassuming, and he doesn't give you the feeling of his own importance. And I feel he's quite unaware of that, but he should not be because he's a very important man, and he is certainly an important person in my life, as was his father. He's my right arm. Hilma and I both love him very much.‚Äù Berger passed away at his home in Princeton, New Jersey on January 22, 2017.

She is also a member of the MSU-DOE Plant Research Laboratory. Her research group investigates how photosynthetic organisms adapt to changes in their environment. Her scholarship extends beyond biology and into studying mentorship and faculty development to develop evidence-based strategies to foster equity and inclusion in academia. In 2020, Montgomery was one of the co-founders and co- organizers of the first Black Botanists Week.  Education and early career  Montgomery received her Bachelor's degree in biology from Washington University in St. Louis and her Master's degree in biology from University of Central Arkansas. She then went on to complete her PhD in Plant Biology at the University of California, Davis. She later became a postdoctoral fellow in Microbial Biology at University of Indiana with the support of a National Science Foundation (NSF) award. In 2004, she joined the research faculty at Michigan State University.  Academic Leadership  Montgomery served as assistant provost for faculty development from 2016-2020 at MSU with responsibility for supporting all faculty and academic staff in the areas of research, scholarship, and creative activities. Since fall of 2020, she serves as interim assistant vice president for research and innovation at MSU.  Research  Montgomery's research centers on the dynamic molecular mechanisms that allow photosynthetic organisms‚Äîfrom cyanobacteria to plant species‚Äîto adapt and respond to changes in their photoenvironment. These organisms must respond to changes in light sources in order to continue photosynthesis, so they've developed finely tuned growth and developmental responses. Montgomery's lab studies a number of molecules that play an important role in this process, including light-absorbing pigments and light-sensing receptors, or phytochromes. In particular, her group works to better understand how these molecules regulate cell morphology and physiology in response to different environments and stressors, focusing their attention on Arabadopsis organ systems and cyanobacteria as model organisms. Her research contributions have been recognized by the American Academy of Microbiology when she was elected as a fellow in 2018. As of 2016, Montgomery holds the title of MSU Foundation Professor in recognition of her scholarly accomplishments, disciplinary development, commitment to creativity, and teaching excellence.  Mentorship  Montgomery also conducts scholarship and training initiatives on mentoring, particularly around issues relating to mentoring and retaining students and junior scientists from underrepresented backgrounds. She has published extensively on evidence-based strategies to nurture and retain talent in academia, developing strategies for effective mentorship that center on the individual and their specific needs and goals. Montgomery has also worked with her colleagues to create sustainable opportunities for career development and enhancement. For instance, she has worked with the American Society for Microbiology to connect research scientists with students in the classroom, with the support of the National Science Foundation. With that funding, Montgomery and her collaborators have established the ASM-NSF Leaders Inspiring Networks and Knowledge (LINK) program, to build \\"links\\" between research investigators, students, and educators.

He published more than 100 scientific reviews and papers on kidney transplant rejection in dogs, confirming that rejection was an example of immune response, mediated by serum antibodies. Early life Dempster was born on the island of Ibo, Portuguese Mozambique, to Jessie and James Dempster, who raised cattle in Portuguese East Africa until the tsetse fly caused the business to collapse. His birth was registered on 28 April 1918 and his birth certificate was issued on 9 August of the same year. However, his real date of birth was 15 March 1918. He survived malaria in early childhood. Following his father's sudden premature death soon after August 1919, his mother took the family back to Edinburgh where Dempster then entered George Heriot's School and where he was active in rugby and cricket. He gained admission to the University of Edinburgh to study medicine, where he was a contemporary of Sheila Sherlock, with whom he played tennis. Family and personal He met Cherry Clark, a nurse in the radiotherapy department at the Hammersmith Hospital who had once been a ballet dancer. They married and had two sons and one daughter. Medical career After qualifying and a brief time working as a locum general practitioner, Dempster joined the Royal Air Force and served in India and Burma during the Second World War. In 1946, looking for work, he met Sheila Sherlock again, who was working at the Hammersmith Hospital. At her suggestion, he applied and was accepted to Ian Aird's surgical unit at the Postgraduate Hospital, Hammersmith, as a researcher in organ transplantation, investigating the outcome of dog kidney allografts. He worked at the Royal College of Surgeon's Buckston Browne Farm, with Sir Arthur Keith, an anatomist and anthropologist, and jokingly referred to the job as one of the hospital's worst roles. Despite this, within six years, he produced more than 100 articles on kidney transplantations in dogs and achieved worldwide acknowledgment for his work. His detailed observations on a macroscopic and microscopic scale, established that organ rejection was a type of immune response, facilitated by serum antibodies. The post-war interest in kidney transplantation was paralleled by a growing knowledge that immunological mechanisms were involved in rejection. Simultaneous work by Simonsen and Ren√© K√ºss found that placing the donor kidney in the pelvis was preferable to a superficial site and all concluded that an immunological mechanism was responsible for rejection. Subsequenlty, Dempster became acquainted with international organ transplantation peers including Georges Math√© of Paris, who also believed that immunological reactions explained graft rejection. Dempster and his associates demonstrated that irradiating the whole body could suppress delayed type hypersensitivity reactions and the response to skin allografts. This primary immunosuppressive therapy with total body irradiation was also used by Hamburger. In addition, he foresaw the concept of graft-versus-host responses. Despite these research results, clinical application appeared distant as Ian Aird was more committed to research. In 1956, Dempster joined Charles Rob‚Äôs surgical team at St Mary‚Äôs Hospital, in performing a renal transplant on a person with acute renal failure. Typically frank and forthright, he described the procedure as an unnecessary tragedy, although it did create an interest in transplantation at St Mary‚Äôs Hospital. In 1960 with Ralph Shackman, he carried out some of the earliest kidney transplants in the UK. Later life Dempster retired to his home in Twickenham and dedicated his remaining time to painting and gardening. He had a particular interest in the work of John Hunter and promoted the cause of evolutionary theorist Patrick Matthew of whom he published a biography in 1983. Matthew's life had parallels with that of Charles Darwin, and wrote about natural selection almost 30 years before Darwin did in his 1859, On the Origin of Species. Following Cherry's death in 2005, Dempster was looked after by his daughter, Soula, who lived nearby. He died on 27 July 2008.

It was the last deep coal mine to be sunk in England in 1987 and was expected to coal for many years, but closed within a few years with geological problems being cited as the issue. History Asfordby was one of three Super-pits proposed by Michael Heseltine, but eventually only Asfordby was sunk. Objections to the minesites locations because of the natural beauty and rurality in those areas led to only Asfordby being started as it was already in an industrial area with a rail connection very close by. Preparatory work began on the mine in 1984, but physical building did not start until 1987, with coaling operations beginning in 1991. Two shafts over deep were dug into the coal seams. In 1994, British Coal was wound up and the Asfordby site was purchased by RJB Mining. The first coal left the mine by train in 1991 and geological problems meant production had ceased by 1997. British Coal invested over ¬£300 million in the pit and after privatisation in 1994, a further ¬£40 million was invested. At is peak, the mine employed 490 personnel. When the closure notice came in, it was partially lamented locally, but it was commented upon by the miners themselves as well as the locals, that the blow would not be felt in the same way as traditional pit villages as most of the men who worked in the pit were from outside the Melton Mowbray area and had taken the jobs at Asfordby when their own mines had been closed down. The mine was closed due to volcanic sills that sat above the coal seams. The volcanic rocks were heavier than expected and had been putting too much pressure on the excavated coal seams below. Just before the closure was announced in August 1997, a massive flood and rockfall destroyed ¬£6 million worth of equipment and the mine was closed leaving behind a possible of mineable coal. The Confederation of UK Coal Producers (COLPRO) wrote to the government to complain as they had authorised a new gas-fired power station and COLPRO and the NUM were fearful that the new Labour government would not support retaining Asfordby mine. Post closure The two winding towers were demolished in 1998 and permission was granted to turn the complex into a business park. In 2007, part of the complex was installed with a test centre for trains that would utilise the adjacent test track from which a spur had been built to connect to the mine. Suggestions for re-use of the site have included siting a wind farm on it and also the prospect of an anaerobic digestion plant.

Career Stevens was admitted to the Virginia state bar and moved to Sussex County, which he represented in both house of the Virginia General Assembly during much of the next two decades. He also purchased additional property in Petersburg. In 1869, Sussex County voters elected Stevens to the Virginia House of Delegates. A Republican, he was the county's sole delegate.Pulliam 1901, p. 141-142 In 1871 voters from Sussex and adjoining Dinwiddie and Greensville Counties elected Stevens to the Senate of Virginia to replace white Republican David G.

It uses vacuum tubes and crystal diodes for logic, and featured a unique magnetic tape format for storage. The CPU uses a 48-bit word (plus four check bits). A word can hold 12 decimal digits (11 digits plus sign) or 8 six-bit alphanumeric characters. The system includes magnetic core storage of 2000 words or 24,000 digits in two banks, called \\"High-Speed Memory.\\" Words in High-Speed Memory are also called \\"registers\\" in the documentation. The system also includes two input and two output tape buffer storage units of 62 words (744 digits) each. The instructions are three address and all operations are storage-to-storage. History Datamatic Corporation was established in 1954 as a joint venture of Raytheon and Honeywell. In 1955 Honeywell bought out Raytheon's interest and the company became known as \\"Honeywell DATAmatic.\\" Later Datamatic was renamed Honeywell Information Systems (HIS). Tape format The DATAmatic uses long reels of wide magnetic tape. The tape format uses 36 tracks (\\"channels\\")‚Äî31 data and 5 for checking. Data is recorded as blocks of 62 words. Within a block two words are recorded serially on each of the 31 tracks. A full reel of tape can contain 50,000 blocks (37,200,000 words). Data transfer rate is 60,000 digits per second. A DATAmatic 1000 system can attach up to 100 tape units. When the tape is initially written data is recorded only in alternate blocks. When the end of the reel is reached the tape is recorded in reverse in previously unused blocks. This eliminates a rewind operation when reading or writing full reels. The format allows individual blocks to be rewritten in place.

It consists of a low frequency, impulse- based ultra-wideband (UWB) radar that uses 16 receivers with 2 transmitters at the ends of the 2 meter-wide receive array that send alternating, orthogonal waveforms into the ground and return signals reflected from targets in a given area. The SIRE radar system comes mounted on top of a vehicle and receives signals that form images that uncover up to 33 meters in the direction that the transmitters are facing. It is able to collect and process data as part of an affordable and lightweight package due to slow (40 MHz) yet inexpensive analog-to-digital (A/D) converters that sample the wide bandwidth of radar signals. It uses a GPS and Augmented Reality (AR) technology in conjunction with camera to create a live video stream with a more comprehensive visual display of the targets. The SIRE radar is part of a long generation of UWB and synthetic aperture radar (SAR) systems developed by the U.S. Army Research Laboratory (ARL) starting in the early 1990s. Past systems include the railSAR and the boomSAR systems as well as the more recent Spectrally Agile Frequency- Incrementing Reconfigurable (SAFIRE) radar system. The SIRE radar was eventually transitioned to the Communications Electronics Research, Development and Engineering Center (CERDEC) at Fort Belvoir, VA. There, it was redesigned as the ALARIC radar system, which was modified to have one fewer transmitter and operate at a bandwidth range from 100 MHz to 1.5 GHz.  Operation  The SIRE radar functions primarily as a method of assessing the surrounding environment and determining whether the path being traversed is safe for vehicular navigation. In general, radar systems have an advantage over optical or laser sensor system because they are not hindered by the presence of fog or dust blocking their line of sight. However, most radar systems use high-frequency microwave radiation, which have difficulty penetrating grass and other foliage. In contrast, the SIRE radar can penetrate foliage, various media, and even the ground to detect hidden or buried IEDs due to its use of low-frequency microwave radiation. The data acquisition cycle for the SIRE radar consist of the following steps: # The central computer sends commands to the timing and control board in the SIRE circuit to emit radar pulses from the left transmitter. # The receiver array picks up the returning radar signals, which are then digitized by the field-programmable gate array (FPGA) acquisition module and sent to the central computer along with the time tag information from the GPS receiver. # The data is integrated, scaled, and converted to frequency domain before being sent to the graphical user interface to be displayed. # The data acquisition cycle repeats with the right transmitter. = Transmitter = The transmitters used in the SIRE radar are transversal electromagnetic (TEM) horns that generate short, 1 nanosecond- long radar pulses with a pulse repetition frequency (PRF) of 1 MHz and a frequency band from 300 to 2500 MHz. The peak power output for the transmitter is 6 watts, while the average power is 5 watts to reduce interference potential. The TEM horns can handle a 200 ohm characteristic impedance and were chosen since they provide good pulse fidelity and low reflected power. The two transmitters alternate in activity with each cycle of the data acquisition process. = Receiver = The receivers used in the SIRE radar are Vivaldi notch antennas which are arranged in a uniform linear array that span the width of the vehicle. Each receiver is connected to a separate receiver channel. The imaging method relies on the back-projection algorithm, where the data from all 16 receiver channels are integrated at successive ranges as the vehicle moves forwards. = Radio-Frequency Interference Suppression = In order to prevent radio-frequency interference (RFI) from outside sources, such as radio, TV and wireless communication signals, in the radio frequency band, the SIRE radar employs several techniques to suppress or extract these signals from the UWB radar data. Instead of conventional methods of screening like the notch filtering approach, the SIRE radar narrowband and wideband RFI screening process involve averaging repeated measurements from the same range-profile.  Modes  The mounted SIRE radar system comes in two modes depending on its orientation on top of the vehicle. The most commonly used mode is the forward- looking mode, where the radar faces towards the front of the vehicle in the direction it is traveling. An alternative is the side-looking mode, where the antenna frame that supports the SIRE radar system is rotated 90 degrees and the direction of the radar is perpendicular to the path of the vehicle. The side-looking mode is designed to survey the area behind walls and map the interior of enclosed buildings.

The group's musical style primarily consists of aggressive electronic dance music. [needle] has seen extraordinary popularity in the Philadelphia and New York City underground music scenes with original distribution through Sony Music via Ruffhouse Records' Contract Records sub- label. The band was originally founded by high school mates Jeffrey D. Erb and Lee Daniels after the dissolution of their former band Sri Lanka (band). Erb and Daniels have performed all of the music on their releases, with Erb playing bass guitar, writing rhythm tracks, keyboards and performing lead vocals. Daniels plays guitar and writes keyboards. The duo work with a revolving group of people who perform live with them. The band's initial full- length release \\"Lifeline\\" garnered critical praise, citing influences including Nine Inch Nails and KFDM among others. The group also released an EP entitled \\"Echelon\\" and in 2020 released the single \\"On Your Knees\\" from its next studio album.  History  Jeffrey Erb and Lee Daniels, the founding members of [needle], were school friends at Reading Senior High School in Reading, Pennsylvania. The two frequently attended local all-ages concerts around the Philadelphia area and knew that they wanted to focus exclusively on all-original music. The duo launched their musical careers when they formed the gothic rock band Sri Lanka (band) in the late '80s. After tumultuous years of competing personalities which ultimately lead to the death of lead singer Brett Turner and the dissolution of Sri Lanka, Erb and Daniels reconnected in 1995 to pursue their musical path by forming the industrial dance band [needle]. Erb and Daniels began writing, with Erb performing rhythm tracks, bass guitar, keyboards and lead vocals, and Daniels on guitars and writing keyboard tracks. Erb and Daniels recorded their first album in the studio of God Lives Underwater a techno rock band from rural Perkiomenville, Pennsylvania (near Philadelphia), who was originally signed to American Recordings after being discovered by Rick Rubin. Founding members of \\"God Lives Underwater\\" David Reilly and Jeff Turzo were good friends of Erb and Daniels, having been part of the Philadelphia underground music scene, and Reilly and Turzo worked with [needle] to produce the band's first album Lifeline\\". The album was picked up for release by Contract Records, a subsidiary of Ruffhouse Records for distribution through Sony Music. With a style that combined aggressive guitars with dance rhythms and funk accents, tracks from \\"Lifeline\\" became popular in dance clubs and strip clubs up and down the East Coast. [needle] began performing in locations in support of their album, opening for acts that included Godflesh and Cubanate. Becoming popular within the industrial music scene, [needle] T-Shirts were seen being worn by major acts, including bands such as Sister Machine Gun. Erb and Daniels recruited other musicians to perform with them live, with the original lineup consisting of Steve Sidek on drums, Sean Jacobs on keyboards, and Stephen Lentz, formerly of Tubalcain on bass guitar. After Lentz moved away from the Philadelphia area, Erb and Daniels recruited Joe Deblasio formerly of Dollhaus Puppet to perform live on drums, and Sean Jacobs took over live bass guitar. Two songs from the album \\"Lifeline\\" were featured in an official expansion pack level of Duke Nukem 3D called \\"Penthouse Paradise\\", available exclusively from GT Interactive and Penthouse Magazine. In 1997, the band recorded an EP called Echelon which was used by Z-Axis Games in the development of an official Rollerball (1975 film) video game adaption based on the film as part of MGM Interactive video game showcase lineup. [needle] continued to perform shows throughout 1996 and 1997 while working on their next full-length studio release, when a hard disk crash caused all of their new material and original tracks to be lost. In 2020, the band released the single \\"On Your Knees\\" produced in Philadelphia by Maxim \\"Lectriq\\" Laskavy and EDM/Rap artist Ryan Banks.

These bands shared equipment and organised concerts, helping Nottingham to become a hotbed of activity during the new wave of British heavy metal. They were progressive but with a heavy, doom influenced sound and were regarded as very professional musicians. They wore a kind of proto-corpsepaint with black clothing. Biography Race Against Time initially formed in 1978 between Chesterfield and Matlock, England. Al Short had played in two bands simultaneously, called Captain Hippo and Heavy Water. He noticed an advert in a music shop window placed by Dave Halliday, whose previous band Skint had recently broken up. Initially they were a four piece, with Halliday on guitar, but as more songs were written he slowly took over on vocals and the band became a three piece. They tried a number of drummers before finding Geoff Green. Following being let down by a record label who pulled out of releasing \\"Bedtime\\" as a single with two B sides at the last minute, they were approached by Nigel Burnham, a journalist who was creating the New Electric Warriors compilation album with Logo Records. The proposed A side of the single is the final track on the album. Unable to regain record label attention, the band decided to split following a session aired on Trevor Dann's BBC Radio Nottingham Rock Show. The band Hell was formed with members of the aforementioned 'East Midlands Bands Cooperative', guitarist Kev Bowler and bassist Tony Speakman from Paralex and drummer Tim Bowler from Overdrive. Halliday used a lot of Race Against Time material in this new outfit. In 2015 Al Short and Geoff Green reunited with Radium members Kevin Healey and Andy Meehan to play the songs of both bands at Brofest in Newcastle. The release of their Time Waits For No Man compilation on High Roller Records coincided with this performance. Musical style Race against time are best described as a NWOBHM band, although they played a darker form of blues that was weeded out of their sound when they evolved into Hell. Band members *Dave G.

Originally formed in 2009 in Virginia by the lead vocalist and bassist Clayton Burgess. The band's lineup as of 2016 included Burgess, Jarrett Nettnin, Stephen Fairfield and Nate Towle. Originally influenced by groups such as Electric Wizard and Black Flag, Burgess mailed a demo tape to Electric Wizard and recorded their first album Wild Beyond Belief, which began with Burgess performing all the instruments while still being attending high school. The group began their follow-up album Die Screaming and were invited by Jus Oborn of Electric Wizard to perform at the Roadburn Festival in 2013. Burgess was then offered to join Electric Wizard in 2014 which he accepted. The group has recorded two follow-up albums since along with a split EP with Windhand which charted in Billboard's Top Heatseekers charts. History Satan's Satyrs were formed in 2009 in Virginia. Lead vocalist Clayton \\"Claythanas\\" Burgess described the idea to form the group formed from hanging out in their basements watching horror films and listening to Black Flag, Electric Wizard, Saint Vitus, Witchfinder General and having the time and to create a band. The band's name was titled after Satan's Sadists which Burgess declared as one of his favorite films of the biker genre, specifically noting the \\"lawlessness of it. [...] I like the desolation of it, and the freedom of what it would be like to be in a biker gang, riding around the desert and being up to no good.\\" Burgess mailed Electric Wizard their demo tape as he found them to be \\"a huge influence.\\" Burgess stated that he first listened to their album Witchcult Today when he was 14 and described their demo tape as a tribute to Electric Wizard. For their debut album in Wild Beyond Belief! was recorded with all instruments performed by Burgess while he was still in high school. Burgess' goal was to complete the record before graduating high school but ended up completing it until a little after graduation. The album was released in 2012. Before the release of Wild Beyond Belief! Burgess high school friend Jarrett Nettnin joined Satan's Satyrs followed by Stephen Fairfield who became their drummer. In 2013, the group began writing material for their next album Die Screaming in 2014 when they were invited by Jus Oborn of Electric Wizard to play at Roadburn Festival in 2013. Their set at Roadburn included original material and a set of Blue Cheer covers. Burgress would later describe playing at Roadburn as the biggest moment for the group in 2013, stating that \\"Before Roadburn, we hadn't done too much... we'd done shows, local shows and tiny tours, but playing Roadburn, to a European audience, was just fantastic.\\" Towards the end of 2013, Burgess was offered to audition as the bassist for Electric Wizard. In February 2015, the group recorded their third album in Nashville. Don't Deliver Us was released in 2015. In 2016, the group added additional guitarist Nate Towle. They then released a split EP with Windhand in 2018 which was through Relapse Records. This split EP peaked at 11 on the Top Heatseekers on its release. Clayton Burgess left Electric Wizard in early 2018 to focus on his band Satans Satyrs. Satan's Satyrs then toured with Windhand in October and November 2018, with a new album titled The Lucky Ones which was released on October 19, 2018 by RidingEasy Records/Bad Omen. Garrett Morris of Windhand produced the album. Satan's Satyrs announced on their Facebook page on July 24, 2019 that the group has disbanded. Style Burgess described the band as wanting to have the \\"speed and aggression of Black Flag\\" while having a \\"psychedelic, downtuned, horror infused atmosphere of Electric Wizard\\" noting that two groups were his favourite bands. Burgess described them as \\"both equal bands, they had so much in common, but so much different, that I just wanted to explore that area.\\" James Monger of AllMusic described the band as \\"a high-octane blend of psych-blasted doom metal, grindhouse punk, and sleazy garage rock\\" Discography * Wild Beyond Belief!

After almost 20 years of providing free legal services to people with HIV/AIDS, he transitioned into theatrical producing with productions including Anastasia, Head Over Heels, Mothers and Sons (Tony nomination), It's Only a Play, and The Visit (Tony nomination) on Broadway, and The Inheritance (Olivier Award for Best New Play), The Jungle, Master Class, and Edward Albee's The Goat, or Who Is Sylvia? in the West End. He recently produced the musical, Hadestown, which opened on Broadway in 2019 and subsequently won 8 Tony Awards, including the Tony Award for Best Musical. He is the producer of the Olivier Award-winning play, The Inheritance, on Broadway and a new off-Broadway revival of Little Shop of Horrors, both set to open in the fall of 2019. He also recently produced the Broadway revival of Frankie and Johnny in the Clair de Lune, starring Audra McDonald and Michael Shannon. He serves as Chair of The Broadway League Government Relations Committee and is a founding director of Berwin Lee London New York Playwrights, Inc. He was named the Broadway Global Producer of the Year in 2014, and received the Commercial Theater Institute's Robert Whitehead Award for Outstanding Achievement in Commercial Theater Producing in 2019.  Early life and education  Kirdahy was born in Hauppauge, New York, in 1963 and is the son of Paul E. Kirdahy and Joan Kirdahy (n√©e McGunnigle). Two-time Tony Award-winner Donna Murphy grew up across the street from him. He attended New York University and graduated as valedictorian of his class in 1985 with a BA in politics and dramatic literature. \\"He served as a student senator and one of the first openly gay chairs of the University Committee on Student Life (UCSL) and the Student Senators Council (SSC).\\" He then went on to NYU School of Law in the hopes of being an entertainment lawyer.  Legal career and activism  The advent of the AIDS crisis steered him towards dedicating his early professional career to fighting for LGBT causes and providing free legal services for people with HIV/AIDS. Kirdahy said, \\"At the time the AIDS crisis was getting worse. A great number of my friends were getting sick and dying. I felt that I needed to do something about the crisis that was decimating my community.\\" He developed projects at Gay Men's Health Crisis and Bronx AIDS services before becoming a Public Advocate in Riverhead, New York, with Nassau-Suffolk Law Services. For many years, he was highly active at the Manhattan Lesbian, Gay, Bisexual, and Transgender Community Center, from its early days when ACT UP was forming to when he became a part of the Executive Board where he played a critical role in expanding its cultural programs. He was the co-Chair of the East End Gay Organization which would eventually lead him to meet his future husband, playwright, Terrence McNally, as well as LGBT figures like Edith Windsor, the plaintiff in the landmark Supreme Court case that led to the legalization of same-sex marriage.  Theatre career  Kirdahy always maintained a strong passion and love for the theatre, even while pursuing a career as an activist and lawyer. Through the East End Gay Organization, Kirdahy and critic, Isa Goldberg, organized a discussion called \\"Theatre From a Gay Perspective\\", which was the beginning of his transition to his producing career. The panel included three playwrights, Lanford Wilson, Edward Albee, and Terrence McNally. In 2007 he produced Deuce by Terrence McNally on Broadway starring Marian Seldes and Angela Lansbury. It was Lansbury's return to Broadway after more than twenty years. Kirdahy went on to produce the Tony- nominated revivals of Ragtime (2009) and the revival of Master Class in the West End starring Tyne Daly (2011). In 2014, he produced Terrence McNally's play Mothers and Sons starring Tyne Daly, which was McNally's 20th Broadway production. The New York Times described the Tony nominated play as \\"an ambitious attempt to dramatize the head-spinning changes in Gay America\\", and \\"a resonant elegy for a ravaged generation\\". It marked the first time a legally wed gay couple was seen on a Broadway stage. In 2014, he would go on to produce It's Only a Play, a satire of an opening night on Broadway. The cast included Nathan Lane, Matthew Broderick, Megan Mullally, Rupert Grint, Stockard Channing, F. Murray Abraham, and Micah Stock. It was directed by three-time Tony Award winner Jack O'Brien. The production broke box office records at the Gerald Schoenfeld Theatre where it was initially scheduled for an 18-week run. The production transferred to the Bernard Jacobs Theatre and was extended to June 7, 2015. The production would eventually star actors Martin Short, Katie Finneran, Maulik Pancholy, and T. R. Knight. Kirdahy followed up It's Only a Play with a production of The Visit, a musical with a book by Terrence McNally, music by John Kander, and lyrics by Fred Ebb. The production was fifteen years in the making, but the production seen on Broadway was the result of a new team assembled by Kirdahy, which included Chita Rivera, Roger Rees, and directed by John Doyle, who Kirdahy stopped on an airplane in order to get the script read by him. The musical went on to earn five Tony nominations. Kirdahy produced the off-Broadway show White Rabbit Red Rabbit by Nassim Soleimanpour in 2016, which ran for 42 weeks at the Westside Theatre ‚Äì \\"a notable achievement on an economically challenging Off-Broadway landscape\\", according to Variety. Each performance, the actor was handed the script in front of the audience. They did not have access to the text until that moment and then performed it live with a script in hand. A portion of the play's profits were donated to PEN International, an association of writers working to promote literature and defend freedom of expression around the world. The idea of a new weekly guest star attracted a rotating cast of performers including Whoopi Goldberg, Nathan Lane, Martin Short, Darren Criss, Alan Cumming, Bobby Cannavale, Billy Porter, Cynthia Nixon, Tony Danza, Brian Stokes Mitchell, and many more. In 2016, Kirdahy produced the musical, Anastasia, on Broadway, after it set box office records in a run at Hartford Stage. The creative team included Terrence McNally (Book), Stephen Flaherty (Music), Lynn Ahrens (Music), and is directed by Tony Award-winner Darko Tresnjak. The musical ran at the Broadhurst Theatre on Broadway from March 23, 2017 to March 31, 2019. The U.S. national tour launched in the fall of 2018. There are also plans for productions in Europe, Asia, the United Kingdom, Australia and South America. There are currently productions in Stuttgart, Germany, and Madrid, Spain, with other openings being planned for the Netherlands, Spain, Russia, Korea, Japan, Mexico, and China. In the West End, he produced The Inheritance at the No√´l Coward Theatre which opened in 2018 and ran until January 19, 2019. The two-part play by Matthew Lopez had a sold-out run at the Young Vic and Dominic Cavendish of The Telegraph called it \\"the most important American play of the century\\". The play was directed by Stephen Daldry and featured John Benjamin Hickey and Vanessa Redgrave. The production won 4 Olivier Awards for Best New Play, Best Direction, Best Actor, and Best Lighting Design. He also produced, alongside Sonia Friedman and Hunter Arnold, The Jungle by Joe Murphy and Joe Robertson and directed by Stephen Daldry and Justin Martin. After a sold-out run at the Young Vic, the production began previews on June 16, 2018 at the Playhouse Theatre in the West End and ran until November 3, 2018. His other productions in the West End includes the 2012 revival of Terrence McNally's Master Class, starring Tyne Daly as Maria Callas, and Edward Albee's The Goat, or Who Is Sylvia? starring Damian Lewis and Sophie Okonedo and directed by Ian Rickson in 2017. In 2019, his newest musical, Hadestown, opened on Broadway at the Walter Kerr Theatre where the New York Times described it as \\"Sumptuous. Hypnotic. Gorgeous,\\" and the Wall Street Journal called it \\"the best new musical of the season.\\" The musical was nominated for 14 Tony Nominations for the Tony Awards on June 9, 2019, the most nominations for any production, including Best Musical. The production is directed by Rachel Chavkin with music, lyrics, and book by Ana√Øs Mitchell. He is also producing the newest revival of Frankie and Johnny in the Clair de Lune by Terrence McNally starring six-time Tony winning actress Audra McDonald and two-time Oscar nominated actor Michael Shannon. Opening on May 30, 2019 at the Broadhurst Theatre, the new production is directed by Arin Arbus and is a celebration of McNally's 80th birthday, who McDonald called \\"one of our great American playwrights.\\" The production has a limited run until August 25, 2019.  Personal life  Kirdahy was married to Terrence McNally, an Emmy and four- time Tony Award-winner, following a civil ceremony in Vermont on December 20, 2003 until McNally's death from COVID-19 on March 24, 2020. They subsequently married in Washington, D.C. on April 6, 2010. In celebration of the Supreme Court's decision to legalize same-sex marriage in all 50 states, they renewed their vows at New York City Hall with Mayor Bill de Blasio, Kirdahy's college roommate, officiating on June 26, 2015.

One of the instruments, a burrowing probe nicknamed \\"the mole\\", is designed to penetrate below Mars' surface. In March 2019, the mole burrowed a few centimeters, but then became unable to make progress due to various scenarios. In the following year further efforts were made to resolve the issues. , the top of the mole is flush with the martian regolith and burrowing efforts are ongoing. HP3 was provided by the German Aerospace Center (DLR). The hammering mechanism inside the mole was designed by the Polish company Astronika and the Space Research Centre of the Polish Academy of Sciences under contract and in cooperation with DLR. The Principal Investigator is Tilman Spohn from the German Aerospace Center. Overview HP3 overview animation The mission aims to understand the origin and diversity of terrestrial planets. Information from the HP3 heat flow package is expected to reveal whether Mars and Earth formed from the same material, and determine how active the interior of Mars is today. Additional science goals include determining the thickness of Mars' crust, the composition of its mantle, and thermal characteristics of the interior, such as the temperature gradient and heat flux. Together with the seismometer, the mission will estimate the size of Mars' core and whether the core is liquid or solid. The vibrations generated by the mole will be monitored by SEIS to learn about the local subsurface. In addition to the mole, HP3 includes an infrared radiometer (HP3-RAD) mounted to the landing platform, also contributed by DLR. The HP3 heat flow probe is made up of the following subsystems: *Support Structure (SS) a housing that includes: **Engineering tether (ET) to communicate between the support structure to the lander **Science tether (TEM-P) a flex PCB with 14 platinum RTDs for measuring thermal properties of the regolith. **Tether length monitor (TLM) optical length meter for measuring the deployed length of the science tether *Infrared radiometer (HP3-RAD) for measuring surface temperature. * Back end electronics (BEE) electronic control unit * Mole penetrometer for burrowing beneath the surface **TEM-A active thermal conductivity sensor ** STATIL tiltmeter for determining orientation and direction of the mole.

InSight was launched on 5 May 2018 and landed on 26 November 2018. Mole penetrometer The mole is described as a \\"self- hammering nail\\" and was designed to burrow below the Martian surface while trailing a tether with embedded heaters and temperature sensors. The goal is to measure the thermal properties of Mars' interior, and thus reveal unique information about the planet's geologic history.Hammering Mechanism for HP3 Experiment (InSight). (PDF) Jerzy Grygorczuk1, ≈Åukasz Wi≈õniewski1, Bartosz Kƒôdziora1, Maciej Borys, Rafa≈Ç Przyby≈Ça1, Tomasz Kuci≈Ñski1, Maciej Ossowski, Wojciech Konior, Olaf Kr√∂mer, Tilman Spohn, Marta Tokarz and Mateusz Bia≈Çek. European Space Mechanisms and Tribology Symposium; 2016. The burrowing mole is a pointed cylinder with a smooth outer surface approximately in length and in diameter. It contains a heater to determine thermal conductivity during descent, and it trails a tether equipped with precise heat sensors placed at intervals to measure the temperature profile of the subsurface. The mole penetrator unit is designed to be placed near the lander in an area about 3-m long and 2-m wide. The total mass of the system is approximately and it consumes a maximum of s while the mole is active. For displacement, the mole uses a motor and a gearbox (provided by Maxon) and a cammed roller that periodically loads a spring connected to a rod that functions as a hammer. After release from the cam, the hammer accelerates downwards to hit the outer casing and cause its penetration through the regolith. Meanwhile, a suppressor mass travels upwards and its kinetic energy is compensated by gravitational potential and compression of a brake spring and wire helix on the opposite side of the mole. In principle, every the probe puts out a pulse of heat and its sensors measure how the heat pulse changes with time. If the crust material is a thermal conductor, like metal, the pulse will decay quickly. The mole is first allowed to cool down for two days, then it is heated to about over 24 hours. Temperature sensors within the tether measure how rapidly this happens, which tells scientists the thermal conductivity of the soil. Together, these measurements yield the rate of heat flowing from the interior. The HP3 mole was originally expected to take about 40 days to reach deep. As the mole burrows, it also generates vibrations that SEIS can detect, which may yield information about the Martian subsurface. =Penetration efforts= In March 2019, the HP3 began burrowing into the surface sand, but became stalled after several centimeters by what was initially suspected to be a large rock. Further analysis and testing with a replica model on Earth suggested the problem may be due to insufficient friction. In June 2019, more evidence for this was revealed when the support structure was lifted off of the HP3 mole. The Martian regolith appeared to be compressed, leaving a gap around the probe. A technique was implemented using the lander's robotic arm to press on the soil near the probe to increase soil friction. Ultimately, this method was not able to generate enough downward force, since the HP3 probe was at the limit of the arm's range. Instead, the team used the robotic scoop to pin the probe against the edge of its hole. This method appeared successful initially, as the probe continued to dig for two weeks, until it was flush with the surface. At this time, the exposed top of the probe was too small for the scoop to press against, so the scoop was re-positioned to press down on the soil near the probe. Unfortunately, this caused the probe to back out again due to unusual soil properties and low atmospheric pressure. As the probe bounced, loose soil filled the area beneath it and lifted the probe halfway out again. In January 2020, the team used the pinning method again, but once again the probe ejected after the scoop was repositioned. In February 2020, the team reevaluated the risks of pushing the back cap of the mole directly using the robotic scoop, and determined the procedure to be acceptable. The procedure progressed slowly due to the requirement to reposition the scoop after each of progress. In June 2020, the top of the mole reached the regolith surface. The mole entered the surface at an angle of 30 degrees from vertical, but this angle may decrease if a greater depth is reached. In July 2020, it was revealed that the mole was bouncing in place, underneath the scoop, suggesting insufficient friction to continue digging. A proposed solution was to fill the hole with sand in order to distribute pressure from the robotic scoop, thereby increasing friction. This procedure was performed in early August 2020. In late August 2020, a test indicated positive results. The scoop applied a downward force to the sand which covered the mole while hammering strokes were performed. This test resulted in a few millimeters of progress, and ultimately buried the instrument. In October 2020, the top of the mole was below the surface of Mars, and a decision was made to scrape two more scoops of regolith and tamp it down with the robotic scoop. Hammering operations are scheduled to continue in January 2021. HP3-RAD Infrared Radiometer The HP3 includes an infrared radiometer for measuring surface temperatures, contributed by DLR and based on the MARA radiometer for the Hayabusa2 mission. HP3-RAD uses thermopile detectors to measure three spectral bands: , and . HP3-RAD has a mass of . The detector was protected by a removable cover during landing. The cover also serves as a calibration target for the instrument, supporting on-site calibration of the HP3-RAD. Infrared radiometers were sent to Mars in 1969 as one of four major instruments on the Mariner 6 and Mariner 7 flyby spacecraft, and the observations helped to trigger a scientific revolution in knowledge about Mars. The Mariner 6 & 7 infrared radiometer results showed that the atmosphere of Mars is composed mostly of carbon dioxide (CO2), and revealed trace amounts water on the surface of Mars.

She was wrecked on 12 March 1989 at Hell's Mouth, Cornwall, United Kingdom. Today little of the ship survives, although some remains can be seen at low tide. Loss Having made calls at Aveiro and Leix√µes, Portugal, Secil Japan was bound for Liverpool carrying timber. While passing the north coast of Cornwall in strong gales, the ship's cargo shifted and an attempt was made to make refuge at Godrevy Point. However, when the anchor was unable to hold and the engines failed to start, Secil Japan was pushed towards Hell's Mouth. A Royal Navy SAR helicopter from RNAS Culdrose and a SAR helicopter from RAF Brawdy were called out to assist, with the latter arriving at 00:30am on 13 March, by which time the ship was aground, with waves submerging and breaking over it. Of the sixteen crew members, who had all sought refuge in the wheelhouse, fifteen were successfully winched to safety. One fatality occurred when the crew member slipped from the strop while being winched and was drowned. The ship soon broke into three, while the crews of both rescue helicopters were later awarded the Edward and Maisie Lewis Award by the Shipwrecked Mariners' Society for their bravery and efforts.https://www.thegazette.co.uk/London/issue/51827/supplement/8905/data.pdfThe Camborne Packet - Stephen Ivall - Brave crews earn top award - May 1989 References Category:1982 ships Category:Ships built in Japan Category:Maritime incidents in 1989 Category:History of Cornwall Category:Cornish shipwrecks ","title":"MV Secil Japan"},{"id":"57917884","text":"Bashar (or Bishr) ben Phinehas ibn Shu'aib was a tenth century Jewish mathematician.

He founded Seeqnce, the first startup accelerator in Lebanon, created the Accelerate conference, and has had a leading role in building Lebanon's startup ecosystem and promoting, advising, mentoring, and investing in startup ecosystems across the world. World renowned tech journalist Monty Munford said Karam is \\"probably the most influential tech person across the Middle East North Africa (MENA) region.\\" Early career and activism Karam created Blogging Beirut, a citizens' photojournalism website, in 2004. During the 2006 Lebanon War, it became one of the most visited blogs in Lebanon. In 2007, he founded his first tech company, Wunbox, with a concept similar to Google Wave. He also started a couple of businesses based on Twitter. In this period, Karam co-authored scientific papers on community information and location technology. With his campaign \\"Flip the Switch\\", Karam lobbied the Lebanese minister of communications into tackling the nation's stifling connection speeds. During the Egyptian revolution of 2011, he kept a real-time online register of missing persons. Startup initiatives In 2010, Karam decided he would assist Lebanese early-stage startups. After a few months of running a collective, he realized that the growing startup scene needed a space. Converting a derelict apartment in Hamra into an office and raising $700,000, Karam founded the startup accelerator Seeqnce. Seeqnce was the first startup accelerator in Lebanon and one of the first in MENA, providing investment, mentoring and offices to each startup. Its first two batches of start-ups raised more than $10 million. In 2014, Karam turned Seeqnce into Alice, one of the first online accelerators, which was based in London and supported by angel investors. For startups, it offered financial templates, performance metrics, and a global pool of mentors. For investors, it provided a library of startups seeking investment, with financial and business information, investment portfolio management and performance monitoring. Its name was a nod to Alice's Adventures in Wonderland, as Karam likened creating a startup to going down the rabbit hole. At Mobile World Congress' 4YFN conference in Barcelona in 2014, he set up the pavilion featuring 14 leading Arab startups. He was a venture capital advisor of Banque du Liban (BDL, the Central Bank of Lebanon) and was a member of the founding steering committee of BDL's Circular 331 startup fund, worth $600 million. Karam created the Accelerate conference, which was one of the 10 biggest tech conferences in the world in 2016. Together with Nicolas Sehnaoui, he created Beirut Angels, an initiative to gather Lebanese angel investors. His initiative Startup Megaphone has promoted the Lebanese startup ecosystem by holding events abroad, such as Startup Lebanon, and creating national strategies and guides endorsed by BDL, such as Lebanon's Startup Ecosystem Roadmap and Startup Guide Lebanon. Mike Butcher (journalist), Editor at Large of TechCrunch, noted that \\"right now I can think of few other people who introduced Lebanon to the international tech community with as much energy, enthusiasm and longevity\\".

During the 1980s, Zyuganov was an ardent opponent of reforms introduced by Mikhail Gorbachev, such as glasnost and perestroika. As leader of the Communist Party of the Russian Federation Zyuganov has been widely considered to be a nationalist. Constitutional reforms In his earlier career, Zyuganov opposed strong executive authority. He held a position in which he evoked Lenin's slogan \\"all power to the soviets\\" in order to illustrate a desire for an executive branch subordinate to the legislature, as is the case in Great Britain. Zyuganov also proposed strengthening legislative control, particularly the role of the legislature in confirming cabinet members. For his 1996 campaign, Zyuganov abandoned his previous stance on executive authority. Instead, Zyuganov adopted a new policy favoring a non-subordinate executive branch. While still rallying against \\"excessive\\" concentration of executive authority, Zyuganov now expressed his desire for the Russian president to have \\"twice\\" the power of the French president and \\"four times\\" that of the American president. Zyuganov's Communist Party had earlier opposed a \\"strong presidency\\", and Zyuganov criticized the \\"excessive\\" concentration of executive power afforded by the constitution adopted by Russia in 1993. However, during his 1996 campaign, he advocated neither replacing the existing constitution by revolution or by calling a new constitutional convention. Instead, he desired to modify the existing constitution by amending it according to its rules. However, the political reality of achieving this made it relatively unlikely, as the constitution's amendment process is difficult. In 1996 he sought to establish a strong central government. In 1996 Zyuganov also sought to reestablish the office of Vice President and to make all governorships elected positions (as opposed to appointed positions). However, on April 11, 1996, Gennadii Seleznev told Izvestiyaon that within a two or three year timeframe, Zyuganov (contrarily to his public stance) planned to dismantle the presidency. According to Seleznev, Zyuganov would transform Russia's government into a parliamentary system. More recently, Zyuganov has proposed introducing regular referendums to give more power to the public. Economic policy In his 1996 campaign Zyuganov admonished the ongoing decline of Russia's economy. Zyuganov promised that he would turn around Russia's economy. Zyuganov called for the reversal of such reforms as privatization of state-run industries and pledged to restore state control of the economy. He assured voters that a powerful state sector would serve its economy well. Much of Zyuganov's campaign focused on the decline of the general standard of living and of industrial production in Russia. Zyuganov promised that he would cure the nation's economic maladies by stimulating both agricultural and industrial production. He also promised that he would restore guaranteed employment and guaranteed pay. In 1996, Zyuganov's Communist Party proposed reinstating the State Planning Committee. The party proposed that such a measure would allow the private sector to be strictly regulated, arguing that government intervention would boost industrial production. During his 2012 campaign, Zyuganov pledged to stop Russia's economic decline by ushering a return to socialism. =Agriculture= During the 1995 legislative election, the Communist Party had aggressively courted the rural vote. In 1996, the Communists renewed much of their 1995 platform in regards to agricultural policy. This policy focused on the \\"scissors\\", the gap between the high input expenses in agriculture and the below-market prices that the state paid for crops. The Communists promised to end this by lowering the costs of inputs and protecting Russian crops from foreign competition. In the speeches that he delivered to rural audiences during his 1996 campaign, Zyuganov criticized Russia's declining agricultural production. He also voiced outrage at the lack of state support for rural regions. Zyuganov went as far as claiming that, due to their outcome, policies neglecting rural areas of Russia qualified as acts of genocide. Zyuganov strongly opposed the sale of agricultural land, but supported the awarding of lifetime leases of land. Most other presidential candidates and parties in 1996 largely disregarded agricultural policy in their platforms. However, the Communist Party made it one of the main focuses of their platform. During his 2012 campaign, Zyuganov advocated renationalizing the agricultural sector of Russia's economy. =Industry= In the 1996 campaign speeches that he delivered to urban audiences, Zyuganov criticized Russia's declining industrial production. Zyuganov expressed a particular interest in protecting the nation's military industries, declaring, In 1996, Zyuganov's Communist Party proposed that, instead of following the International Monetary Fund's program for the country to develop a free market economy, Russia would instead implement large government investments in industries as well as protective tariffs against foreign competition. They also called for export tariffs on oil and gas in order to procure government revenue. In 1996, Zyuganov did not advocate nationalizing small industries. However, the Communist Party's platform did envision state ownership of infrastructure industries, such as energy, transportation, and communications. It also envisioned state ownership for other industries of strategic importance, such as the defense industry. Furthermore, the party's economic administrator at the time had expressed a desire to also nationalize the exporting metallurgy industry. In 1996, Zyuganov additionally promised to implement a state monopoly of the alcohol industry in order to increase federal revenues. Zyuganov's 2000 platform similarly advocated for a \\"regulated market\\", in which the state would hold a controlling share in certain key sectors of the economy, such as the energy, transport and military industries. At the same time, in an adaption of trickle-down economics, Zyuganov proposed cutting taxes on domestic industry in half. He additionally proposed cuts to energy, transport and communications tariffs. Zyuganov has continued to advocate the nationalization of major industries, such as oil and gas and other industries related to the extraction of natural resources. His main economic proposal was reportedly the nationalisation of Russia's natural resources, while his foreign policy aims include \\"increasing the role of the UN... and restricting the influence of Nato\\". In his 2012 campaign platform, Zyuganov pledged to restore industries he believed were in \\"deep crisis\\", such as shipbuilding, the defense industry and agriculture. Additionally, in order to aid Russia's defense industry, he proposed implementing a complete ban on the mass purchase of foreign-made military equipment. =Ownership= During his 1996 campaign, Zyuganov, pledged to preserve a bulk of the forms of ownership of economic enterprises that had been allowed, including private ownership. However, as a communist, he expected that, \\"the leading role of socialist forms of ownership will clearly come to prominence\\".[ http://researchbriefings.files.parliament.uk/documents/RP96-70/RP96-70.pdf] Zyuganov spoke of reversing-course and reinstating government controls on the nation's economy.[https://www.nytimes.com/1996/06/17/world/russian-vote- heartland-yeltsin-won-over-city-that-looked-him-coldly.html Zyuganov's Communist Party did not entirely oppose privatization. Instead, the party emphasized the importance of developing an economy with many different forms of ownership, including state, cooperative, and private ownership. Sweden, Austria and other Western European nations with mixed economies were pointed to as models to illustrate this vision. During his 1996 campaign, Zyuganov discussed using implementing controls in lieu of state ownership of small enterprises. However, the Communist Party did envision state ownership of infrastructure industries, such as energy, transportation, and communications. As is mentioned in the section on agriculture, Zyuganov was strongly opposed to the sale of agricultural land. However, he did support the awarding of lifetime leases of land. The Communist Party issued proposals in 1996 that would ban the ownership of land, with the exception of small garden plots. In an interview given on May 12, 1996, Zyuganov tied socialist state-ownership with Russia's national character, saying, Zyuganov's 1996 economic platform also focused on issues such as inequity and corruption that had arisen in the privatization process. Zyuganov pledged to overturn privatization that had taken place illegally. In his trips abroad during his 1996 campaign, Zyuganov attempted to quell concerns that he would be hostile towards foreign investment. He would insist that he desired to maintain friendly business climate in Russia. In his February 1, New York Times op-ed, Zyuganov stated that he would pursue economic cooperation and exchanges with the west, but added, While Zyuganov would talk to foreign investors about economic reform and political pluralism, at his own campaign rallies he denounced capitalism. While he and his party were not proposing an outright ban on foreign investments (and insisted they would welcome foreign investment), the Communist Party did propose legislation in 1996 that would severely limit the foreign-owned market share of the Russian economy. For instance, legislation was proposed to restrict foreign-made entertainment to make up no more than 20 percent of all television programming in Russia. Additionally, they proposed legislation which would ban foreign entities from purchasing ownership of Russian land, natural resources or energy complexes. Additionally, the legislation would have banned foreign entities from purchasing controlling interests in \\"key industries of the basic branches of the economy.\\" By 2000, Zyuganov remained steadfast in his opposition to private ownership of agricultural land. He also advocated instating a state monopoly on alcohol and tobacco. In his 2012 campaign, Zyuganov again proposed renationalizing industries involving natural resource extraction. He also proposed renationalizing the agricultural and defense sectors of the nation's economy. Zyuganov has alleged that Yeltsin dismantled the Congress of People's Deputies of Russia because he saw it as the final obstruction to, \\"thuggish privatization and stealing of the people‚Äôs property\\". =Retirement= In 2018, Zyuganov denounced government plans to raise the retirement age, and suggested for a referendum to be held on the matter. =Taxes= At the time of his 2000 presidential campaign, in an adaption of trickle-down economics, Zyuganov proposed cutting taxes on domestic industry in half. Zyuganov has been a proponent of implementing a 20% tax on all capital outflows. In his 2012 campaign, Zyuganov promised to lower most citizens' taxes by implementing a progressive taxation regime and to instituting new government price-control mechanisms on necessities. =Wages= At the time of his 2000 presidential campaign Zyuganov proposed increasing minimum wages. His proposed minimum wage increases would equal $105 per month for doctors and teachers and $35 for others, a significant increase from the existing minimum wage, which equaled just $14. Foreign policy Zyuganov's foreign policy is strongly nationalist and anti-western. On February 1, 1996, an op-ed authored by Zyuganov was published in The New York Times largely outlining Zyuganov's planned foreign policy. Zyuganov wrote, Zyuganov's 1996 foreign policy statements included aspects that some observers believed resembled Gorbachev's early period of leadership. Zyuganov, however, argued that Russia's foreign policy should be void of ideological underpinnings and should instead be targeted and practical. In 2000, Zyuganov expressed a belief that Russia held the, \\"unique role as the pivot and fulcrum\\" of a Eurasia that is destined to forever compete with the West. During the 2011 legislative campaign, he declared that Russia needed to increase its number of allies in order to ‚Äúcounter the aggressive policies of imperialist circles.‚Äù This included rekindling ties with Ukraine and Belarus. =Agreements and treaties= During his 1996 campaign, Zyuganov declared his willingness to withdraw Russia from existing agreements, saying, In the 2011 legislative election, Zyuganov promised to strengthen Russia's role on the world stage and to, \\"get rid of the dictate of 'global rules'.\\" =Commonwealth of Independent States= During his 1996 presidential campaign, Zyuganov declared that he intended to pursue the voluntary reintegration of nations into a reestablished Commonwealth of Independent States. He declared his plans to pursue the initiation of negotiations to establish the organization. At the same time, Zyuganov postured that he considered Russia to be \\"part\\" of Europe. =European Union= In the 2010s, Zyuganov has blamed the United States for the inability of Russia to form a benevolent partnership with European nations. He has also accused the United States and the European Union of challenging Russia's right of sovereignty. Zyuganov has opposed the prospect of Ukraine joining the European Union. =NATO= Zyuganov threatened to delay the implementation of the Start II treaty (signed by George H. W. Bush and Yeltsin) if NATO expansion were to occur. During his 1996 presidential campaign, Zyuganov declared NATO expansion to be a dangerous proposition that conflicted with Russia's internal affairs. Zyuganov said that he would delay the implementation of START II if NATO expansion were to occur During the 2011 legislative election, Zyuganov declared that he continued to view NATO as a threat to Russia. He promised to attempt to limit the influence of NATO or cause it to dissolve. In 2012 presidential election, his foreign policy platform included and aim towards \\"restricting the influence of NATO\\". Zyuganov has continued to characterize NATO as an aggressor. =Terrorism= Zyuganov has suggested that, in order to stop terrorism, it is necessary to bring an end to globalism. Zyuganov blamed the United States for the January 2015 √éle-de-France attacks in Paris, France and other acts of terrorism in Europe. =World Trade Organization= In his 2012 presidential campaign, Zyuganov advocated distancing Russia from the World Trade Organization. =Syria= Zyuganov has opposed Western involvement in Syria. =Ukraine= During the War in Donbass, Zyuganov accused the \\"Western partners\\" of both creating and taking advantage of instability in Ukraine. He has alleged that the 2014 election of Petro Poroshenko was fraudulent. Zyuganov has vehemently opposed the prospect of Ukraine joining the European Union, arguing the Ukraine would cease being a \\"neutral\\" nation if it joined the EU. =United Nations= In his 2012 presidential campaign, Zyuganov called for the role of the United Nations to be strengthened. =United States= In his 1996 campaign, Zyuganov asserted that Russia never could serve as a \\"junior partner\\" to the United States. Zyuganov also asserted that the United States should not aspire to be the world's sole superpower. Zyguanov has blamed the United States for the collapse of the Soviet Union. Amongst other things, Zyuganov has also accused the United States of supporting international terrorism and of challenging the sovereignty of Russia. Military policy In speeches during his 1996 campaign, Zyuganov decried what he alleged to be the total destruction of the Soviet military-industrial complex. Zyuganov promised to rebuild Russia's military powers, declaring, \\"The army needs reforming ‚Äîand not only organizationally and militarily‚Äîtechnically.\\" Zyuganov criticized Yeltsin as being responsible for the ongoing First Chechen War To counter claims by Yeltsin's campaign that a Zyuganov presidency would likely bring a civil war, Zyuganov noted that Yeltsin's leadership had instigated a war in Chechnya. Zyuganov claimed that the Chechen conflict had the potential to spread throughout the rest of the country. At the time of his 2000 presidential campaign Zyuganov agreed with Putin's handling of the Second Chechen War During his 2012 campaign, Zyuganov stated that if elected president he would fire Minister of Defense Anatoliy Serdyukov. He would also undo many of the 2008 reforms introduced by Serdyukov. This would include reverting Serdyukov's downsizing of Russia's military education. He additionally promised to solve social problems found within the military, such as hazing. Social policy During his 1996 campaign, Zyuganov's overall vision for Russia's future was of a socialist society. A nation where citizens were to be provided with \\"cradle-to-grave\\" socialist care. Zyuganov vowed to enlarge the country's social safety nets, and proposed a broad socialist program.http://www.cnn.com/WORLD/9604/22/russia.elex/index.html Zyuganov, and his political party, rejected the label of social democratic. Zyuganov stated, \\"In Russia, social democracy of the West European type has no chance.\\" Consequentially, his campaign platform eschewed many social democratic principles. In his 2000 campaign Zyuganov continued to advocate for a significant expansion to Russia's social safety net. In 2011, speaking of resolving discord among ethnic, social, and wealth groups in Russia, Zyuganov declared, ‚ÄúIt is our responsibility to build up relations so that there will be true friendship between peoples.\\" He added, ‚ÄúRussians have found themselves in the most demeaning of positions. And that is while Russian culture, language, and traditions could provide a basis for integrity. That includes an ability to live together (with other nations), get on well, without destroying even a single language, culture or religion.‚Äù During his 2012 campaign Zyuganov declared his belief that, in order to solve problems in Chechnya, Russia needed to, \\"return to the Soviet experience of building interethnic and socio-economic relations in the Caucasus and then the main problems of the region will be solved.\\" =LGBT rights= Zyuganov supported the Russian gay propaganda law. =Media censorship= Zyuganov has at various times proposed censorship of foreign films and advertisements, as well as measures that would reduce the amount of television programming showing murder, money and pornography. In 1996, legislation was proposed by the Communist Party that would restrict foreign-made entertainment to make up no more than 20 percent of all television programming in Russia. =Religion= Zyuganov is a Christian communist. According to Zyuganov, Jesus Christ was the first communist, claiming the Bible may be read through a socialist perspective. Christian Orthodox Communism in the Fascist Russia: who stands behind the back of Putin. \\"Argument\\". 25 July 2014 Zyuganov also stated that Communism does not need to antagonize the Christian Orthodox Church. Zyuganov, numerous times, during his 1996 campaign spoke of his appreciation for the Russian Orthodox Church, seeking to earn the vote of religious voters. In his first campaign visit to Siberia, Zyuganov proclaimed that he, \\"like Josef Stalin\\", had great respect for the Russian Orthodox Church. Antisemitism As early as 1996 Zyuganov was accused of turning a blind-eye to antisemitism among his supporters. In December 1998 Zyuganov wrote an open-letter alleging of a \\"Zionist conspiracy to seize power in Russia\\", and of a \\"Zionist\\" plot to dominate the world. Zyuganov insisted that these allegations were not aimed at attacking Jews. However, the allegations he made belong to common antisemitic canard. In the same letter, Zyuganov also assailed Jewish financiers. Around the same time, following heavily antisemitic remarks by Albert Makashov, Zyuganov found himself under pressure to publicly censure him for his statements. Zyuganov ultimately did issue a statement denouncing anti- Semitism, but at the same time labeled Zionism \\"a blood relative of fascism\\".Washington Post, November 8, 1998 However, he defended Mashakov's statements as, \\"a tough response to the destructive actions of forces that have occupied our country.\\" Other policy =Changing the national flag= Zyuganov vowed to hold a referendum on replacing the Russian tri-color with the former Soviet flag. Zyuganov claimed that the tri-colored flag had been used by Russian collaborators who fought alongside Germans against the Red army in World War II. =Multi-partisan character of government= In 1996, Zyuganov had pledged that, if elected, his presidential administration would not be a narrow communist-party based one. Rather, he promised that he intended to offer positions in his presidential ministry to presidential candidates such as Yavlinsky, Lebed and Fedorov, and to offer other non- communist politicians roles in his government. Zyuganov also assured that non- communist government employees were not at risk of losing their jobs. Similarly, when he was planning to run in 2018, Zyuganov promised that he would retain (and even promote) members of the government bureaucracy who were honest and uncorrupted. =Re-Stalinization= In the 2010s, Zyuganov has advocated for a re-Stalinization of Russia. In particular, he wrote an open letter to then-president Dmitry Medvedev in 2010 advocating this.

Fifield (November 18, 1832 - July 23, 1918) was a Vermont attorney. He served as United States Attorney for the District of Vermont (1869-1880) and chief counsel of the Central Vermont Railway, and was a prominent corporation attorney who represented clients throughout New England and New York. Early life Benjamin Franklin Fifield was born in Orange, Vermont on November 18, 1832, the son of Orange Fifield and Melissa (Nelson) Fifield. Orange Fifield moved his family to Montpelier when Fifield was a youth, and he was educated in the public schools of Montpelier, Montpelier Academy, and Plattsburgh Academy in New York. He then attended the University of Vermont, from which he received a bachelor of arts degree in 1855. Fifield studied law at the Montpelier firm of Lucius B. Peck and Stoddard B. Colby, and was admitted to the bar in 1858. Career Fifield practiced law with Peck and Colby. After Colby left Vermont in 1864 to serve as U.S. Register of the Treasury, Fifield became Peck's partner, and they practiced as Peck and Fifield until Peck's death in 1866. After Peck's death, Fifield continued the law practice as the firm's sole partner. His later partners included Charles W. Porter and Clarence H. Pitkin. Beginning in 1869, he served as counsel for the Central Vermont Railway, and his effective representation of corporations became so well known that he acquired clients from throughout the northeastern United States. A Republican, in 1869, Fifield was appointed United States Attorney for the District of Vermont, and he served until 1880. When U.S. District Judge David Allen Smalley died in 1877, Fifield was the leading candidate to replace him, but withdrew in order to continue representing the Central Vermont Railway and other clients in pending litigation, which he did in addition to his U.S. Attorney's duties. In 1880 and 1881 he was Montpelier's member of the Vermont House of Representatives, and served as chairman of the House Judiciary Committee. From 1883 to 1884, Fifield served as president of the Vermont Bar Association. In 1884, Fifield was a delegate to the Republican National Convention. In 1885, he was one of the federal commissioners appointed to select a site in Montpelier for a new post office and courthouse. In 1893, Fifield was one of Vermont's commissioners for creating and operating the state's exhibits at the World's Columbian Exposition. Fifield was also a longtime trustee of the University of Vermont. Retirement In the mid 1890s, Fifield retired from most legal business, but continued to serve as counsel for the Central Vermont Railway. In January 1899, Governor Edward Curtis Smith offered to appoint Fifield to the United States Senate seat left vacant by the death of Justin Smith Morrill. Fifield initially gave his tentative acceptance, but declined several days later, informing Smith that he felt obligated to turn down the appointment so he could care for his wife during her final illness. Smith then offered the appointment to Jonathan Ross, who accepted. Death and burial After Fifield's wife died in March 1899, he retired and continued to reside in Montpelier. He died in Montpelier on July 23, 1918, and was buried at Green Mount Cemetery in Montpelier. Family In 1865, Fifield married Lucy Hubbard (1838-1899) of Montpelier. They were the parents of three daughters. Fanny (1865-1948) was the wife of Burnside B. Bailey. Arabella (\\"Belle\\" (1870-1963) married Julius F. Workum.

It dominated the contest with its pilots achieving first and second places. Design and development Reports of the first German glider contest, held at the Wasserkuppe in the late summer of 1920, generated considerable interest in Poland, leading to the First Polish Glider Contest at Czarna G√≥ra between 30 August and 13 September 1923. The contest was not a great success, limited by novice designers and pilots and a poor site, but the SL.1 Akar was by far the most successful entrant. It was designed in 1922 by Adam Karpi≈Ñski, a student in the Sekcja Lotnicza (SL}, the aviation section of Warsaw Technical University and was built by other SL students. The all-wood Akar was a cantilever monoplane with a three-part wing built around twin spars. The wing had a rectangular plan centre-section with trapezoidal outer panels and was fabric covered. It was mounted on top of two parallel open frames, spaced about apart, forming its fuselage. These each had longitudinal straight upper and curved lower chords interconnected by short oblique web members and were braced together by three transverse struts. Two, one from each of the two forward-most web members, carried the pilot's seat. The chords of each frame converged at the rear, where the third transverse member carried the empennage. The tailplane was confined between the fuselage frames but the elevators projected beyond, carrying balances. There were no fins but twin roughly rectangular rudders. A forward cross-axle extending beyond the fuselage frames gave the large wheels a wide track and the upward- curving lower chords acted as skids to prevent nose-overs. Though most of the gliders entered into the contest had not flown before its opening, the Akar had made its first flight on 24 August 1923, piloted by the designer's brother, Tadeusz. Seven flights were made before the contest began, flown by Karpi≈Ñski and by Ryszard Bartel; the longest of these lasted 96 seconds and was made by Bartel. These test flights revealed good handling, with effective and balanced controls. Operational history The Akar dominated the contest, flown both by Karpi≈Ñski who was placed first and by Bartel, placed second. Its longest flight lasted 186 seconds; it made a flight of over and gained an altitude of . In the following spring the Akar was used by the SL to look for good gliding sites in the Babia G√≥ra. Equipped with skis, it made a flight on 3 April 1924 (another source gives the date as 8 April) which lasted 325 s, covered about and set a Polish record which stood for over four years. It crashed either at the end of this flight or in a later one. After the crash the glider was redesigned by Stanis≈Çaw Prauss as the Akar II, with a rectangular section, ply-covered fuselage and a new empennage. It was entered for the Second Polish Polish Glider Contest of 1925, though it did not appear there. Though Cynk reports that the Akar II was built, another source claims that the students were blocked from using the University workshop and no rebuilding of the Akar occurred. Its remains were destroyed in the autumn of 1925.

Distribution N. cristatus is found in the northern Pacific and, in lesser numbers, in the Chukchi Sea and the Arctic Sea. It has also been recorded off of the coast of Chile. Ecology =Life cycle and reproduction= Although N. cristatus breeds year round, it peaks in terms of reproductive activity from October to December. Breeding occurs at depth; at Station P, adults reproduce at depths below . At Site H, off of the east coast of Hokkaido, adults reproduce at depths below . Here, adults are usually located from about in depth. After being spawned, the nauplii ascend to the surface. During this ascent, they develop into stage VI nauplii or stage I copepodites. According to studies in a laboratory with water at , it takes about 40 days for this development to happen. The nauplii feed off of their large yolk during their growth. Stage I through IV copepodites are found in the top of depth. During a period of the year, stage I through IV copepodites may be found from the thermocline to between about ; in some areas, this is correlated with high temperatures near the surface. It takes about four months to develop from a stage I to a stage V copepodite. Stage V copepodites migrate below of depth in July and August and enter diapause, emerging as adults after September. Overall, the life cycle of N. cristatus is annual, like the rest of its genus.

It is found in the mountains of eastern North America from Georgia and Tennessee to Nova Scotia. Names The specific epithet is from the ('yellow') and ('soapy'), both of which are distinguishing features of the mushroom. The name was originally published as Ramaria flavo-saponaria, including a hyphen. However, this is considered erroneous by the International Code of Nomenclature for algae, fungi, and plants, so the proper orthography is Ramaria flavosaponaria. Before being formally described in 1986 by Ron Petersen, the species was labelled in scientific collections under various names. Ramaria aurea sensu mihi was used for its resemblance to the European Ramaria aurea. It was also sometimes labeled Ramaria aquafaba, at least as early as 1969, predating the 2015 coinage of the term aquafaba in an unrelated culinary usage. This term possibly relates to the use of some yellow species of Ramaria (possibly including R. flavosaponaria) to make flavorful broth. cooked R. flavosaponaria has a beany flavor, so this 'bean water' (Latin + ) likely led to the early R. aquafaba name. Description R. flavosaponaria is easily distinguished from related mushrooms by the brilliant gold color, the large number of aborted branchlets, a surface that feels slippery, a lack of clamp connections, and a complex spore ornamentation. It is sometimes confused with Ramaria aurea, which only grows in Europe. Ramaria stuntzii also lacks clamps, has small spores, and aborted branchlets, but is a bright red color and not slippery to the touch. There is also a similar Ramaria species in Nova Scotia that is bronze-colored and also not slippery. Macroscopically Ramaria primulina closely resembles R. flavosaponaria, but the former produces larger spores, has clamps, and flesh that is more gelatinous than soapy. R. flavosaponaria has fruiting bodies up to in size that are broadly obovate to circular in shape and cespitose or scattered. The irregularly shaped stipe grows up to with much aborted branching, giving an appearance like cauliflower. The flesh is white to yellow, does not bruise, but has a soapy texture without being gelatinous. The above-ground parts are weakly vinescent (turning to a red wine color) around particles of soil. The flesh is brittle whether dried or fresh. The odor of fresh specimens is fabaceous (bean-like), which becomes like fenugreek upon drying. The taste is described as moderately fabaceous, but it is not known if the species is edible. A Colorado couple suffered gastrointestinal distress and cramps from a mushroom similar to the European R. aurea, but if this was R. flavosaponaria or another species is uncertain. The species tests positive with pyrogallol. It is moderately positive in response to ferric chloride. Tincture of guaiac is negative on the branch sections but weakly positive on the surface of the stipe. Ammonium hydroxide and potassium hydroxide cause bleaching. Testing with melzer's reagent is negative. The trama hyphae of the upper branches are no bigger than 7 Œºm in diameter and appear glassy, are hyaline, and lack clamp connections. The areas near the septa are inflated up to 15 Œºm and are ornamented delicately. Gloeoplerous hyphae are not present. The hymenium is thickening, with clavate basidia that also lack clamp connections. The subcylindrical or narrowly ovate spores are 3.6-5.4 √ó 7.2-11.2 Œºm with roughened profiles. The spores have walls up to 0.3 Œºm thick, with ornamentation of low warts and meandering, reticulate, and complex cyanophilous ridges. Spore prints are cinnamon buff. Ecology R. flavosaponaria forms ectomycorrhizal relationships with Fagus sylvatica (European beech). It has been found growing under Tsuga canadensis (eastern hemlock) and Quercus (oak) trees.

Rose is an American cardiothoracic surgeon, scientist, entrepreneur and professor and Chairman of the Department of Population Health Science & Policy, and Associate Director for Clinical Outcomes at Mount Sinai Heart. He is best known for performing the first successful paediatric heart transplant, in 1984 while at NewYork‚ÄìPresbyterian Hospital (NYP). Later, he led the REMATCH Trial, published 2001, which compared the permanent implantation of a Left Ventricular Assist Device (LVAD) with conventional medical treatment in people with severe heart failure who were not eligible for heart transplantation. Rose has co-founded several biotechnology companies and has been involved in developing anti-virals to smallpox, new medical technologies and new approaches to Alzheimer's disease and bioterrorism. He was president of the International Society for Heart and Lung Transplantation for 1993‚Äì94. Early life and family Rose attended the Bronx High School of Science and was class of 1968. At school, he was part of a rockband called Metropolitan Blues Express, an experience he has described as \\"diverse\\" and useful as an exercise in \\"team-building\\". He married anaesthesiologist, Ellise Delphin, and they have four children who all live in Manhattan. Early medical career NewYork‚ÄìPresbyterian Hospital/Columbia campus Rose completed both his undergraduate, major in psychology at Columbia University and his medical degree at Columbia University College of Physicians and Surgeons . After graduation he did his residencies in surgery and thoracic surgery at what was then the Presbyterian Hospital. He spent more than 25 years at Columbia- Presbyterian Medical Center, now NewYork‚ÄìPresbyterian Hospital / Columbia University Medical Center. During his career at NYP, he held numerous positions including director of the Clinical Perfusion Service and of the Surgical Cardiac Intensive Care Unit, chief of the Cardiothoracic Surgical Service, the Morris and Rose Milstein Professor of Surgery, and associate dean for translational research. He was president of the International Society for Heart and Lung Transplantation (ISHLT) for 1993‚Äì94. Heart transplantations =Paediatric heart transplantation, 1984= Keith Reemtsma had started an adult transplantation programme in 1977 at NewYork‚ÄìPresbyterian / Columbia and recruited Rose and others to initiate paediatric transplantations. The then- new immunosuppressant Cyclosporin was approved by the FDA in 1983 and contributed to the first successful heart transplant in a child in June 1984. James Lovette, from Denver, was born with a single ventricle, a condition that was fatal in 1984. The longest survival in a child heart transplant procedure was eighteen days until Rose and his team performed four year old James‚Äôs heart transplant on 9 June 1984. The donor heart came from Dorothy Ford's son, John Ford, who was also a four-year-old boy who died after falling from a New York apartment trying to escape a fire. Magnifying glasses helped Rose visualise James's small heart during the surgery and afterwards, rejection was prevented by tailoring the dose of cyclosporine. At the age of 10 years, he required a second heart transplant. James survived twenty one years after the first transplant, during which at one time he also suffered from Hodgkins lymphoma. His parents were able to witness his graduation and the start of a medical career. However, during his first week of medical school, he died in his sleep. =Frank Torre, 1996= On 25 October 1996, Rose led the heart transplant procedure on Yankees manager Joe Torre's brother, 64-year-old baseball player Frank Torre. The previous day, a 28-year-old man from The Bronx had died of severe brain injury at Montefiore Medical Center and his family had consented to donate his kidneys, liver, pancreas and heart. Computer software used by the New York Regional Transplant Programme matched blood, tissue type and dimensions of the heart of this donor with that of John's. Already having had three heart attacks and suffering from severe (class IV) congestive heart failure, John had a very poor quality of life and was severely limited in mobility. On the morning of the operation, Rose, with Mehmet Oz, MD who was his deputy in the NYP/Columbia Department of Cardiothoracic surgery at the time, took four hours to complete the procedure and by midday the surrounding publicity was immense. The operation was successful and over the coming days, Frank managed to watch his brother‚Äôs baseball team beat the Atlanta Braves to win the Series. REMATCH Trial (Randomized Evaluation of Mechanical Assistance for the Treatment of Congestive Heart Failure) =Background= During the 1990s, LVADs were used successfully as a bridge-to-transplantation device, that is, to fill the time before a suitable donor could be found, and medical treatment options were limited. Despite the uncertainties, the clinical potential of LVADs for transplant-ineligible heart failure patients encouraged Rose and others to expand the use of these devices beyond their short-term use. Its safety and life expectancy were unknown and it was unclear as to whether they would provide better outcomes than conventional treatment with medication in people with severe heart failure. Cost-effectiveness was also a factor. =PREMATCH= The first phase, April 1996 to April 1998, was called PREMATCH and it demonstrated enough data to move to the next larger scale trial. It revealed that the severely ill, older, not fit for heart transplant person could withstand the implant procedure, the implant used being the HeartMate LVAD. However, it was still uncertain as to whether those with an LVAD performed clinically better. Thoratec Corporation demonstrated sufficient safety, efficacy and reliability data to secure premarket approval. With further modifications to the trial methods, the REMATCH protocol was finalized for the second phase multicenter RCT. =Second phase= Led by Rose when he was chair of Columbia University and surgeon-in-chief at Columbia Presbyterian Medical Center, the REMATCH randomized clinical trial was conducted from May 1998 to July 2001 in collaboration between Columbia University, the National Institutes of Health (NIH) and the Thoratec Corporation. It compared the permanent implantation of a Left Ventricular Assist Device (LVAD) with conventional medical treatment in people with heart failure who were not eligible for heart transplantation. The LVADs were donated by the Thoratec Corporation and the NIH provided finances for the administration and the collection and analysis of data. The CMS and participating hospitals paid for treatment and hospitalization costs. The potential financial exploitation of vulnerable people with life-threatening disease was omitted by not having any charges for study costs and the whole trial was supervised by a steering committee and conveyed by an operations committee with an independent coordinating centre. All 129 people in the trial were not eligible for transplant surgery. They were typically older, with severe left ventricular dysfunction and other medical problems including pulmonary hypertension, peripheral vascular disease and renal disease. 68 people received a LVAD, Thoratec‚Äôs HeartMate XVE LVAD, and 61 received drug treatment. The results surprised many medical professionals. LVAD patients lived significantly longer than those on medical treatment. Later career and other roles Rose co- founded several biotechnology companies including Nephros, which is concerned with heart and kidney related medical devices, and between 1997 and 2009, has served at various points, as its chairman, president, chief executive and director. Between 2007 and 2016, he was chief executive of the anti-viral developer Siga Technologies, having been an executive director at SIGA since 2001 and a member of the National Biodefense Science Board since 2007. He was appointed executive vice president for life sciences at MacAndrews & Forbes in 2007, a position he held until 2016. Rose joined Mount Sinai in 2008 as the Edmond A. Guggenheim, Professor and Chairman of the Department of Population Health Science & Policy, and Associate Director for Clinical Outcomes at Mount Sinai Heart, taking his 40-member team with him. He has particularly worked on anti-virals to smallpox and developing medical technologies and new approaches to Alzheimer's disease and bioterrorism. He has three patents to his name, has brought more than $50 million in on-going federally financed research, and has been recognized as a \\"grant magnet\\" by Mount Sinai. Awards * During their 53rd annual meeting, in 2017, the Society of Thoracic Surgeons awarded Rose the Bakken Scientific Achievement Award.

The Ghana Armed Forces Central Band (GAF Central Band or AFCB) is the official military band of the Ghana Armed Forces. The AFCB is the oldest military band in the country and the most senior in the military, hence its name. Its command structure runs through the Support Services Brigade (in an arrangement designated in the mid-1980s) while its official branch of service is the Ghana Army. It is currently led by Lieutenant Colonel Badiako Asare. Musicians are recruited from all branches of the armed forces, with soldiers being required to have 2 credits and 4 passes at West African Senior School Certificate Examination (WASSCE), as well as have to be at least 27 years old. Ghanaian military band history Drums and blowing through pipes were a common aspect of military bands even before the United Kingdom came to control Ghana. The earliest indication of a military band in the Gold Coast was during the Battle of Nsamankow in 1824. The Royal Military Band of Kumasi, Gold Coast was a British Army band that was dressed in a mix of traditional and British style uniforms, having a mix of European brass instruments as well as western style drums. In the 1970s, Lieutenant Colonel Robert Budu Larb served as band director. The band today State functions that are supported by the GAF Band include the Trooping of the Colour on Independence Day, state visits and the guard mounting ceremony at Accra's Jubilee House. Members of the band perform in army uniforms similar to those of the President's Own Guard Regiment. In November 2001, Defence Minister Kwame Addo-Kufuor personally conducted the band. The band and the 66th Artillery Regiment were present during the inauguration of President Alassane Ouattara of Cote d'Ivoire in Yamoussoukro on 21 May 2011. As a result, President John Evans Atta Mills personally consulted with the band (led by then Lieutenant Colonel Francis Ennin) and the regiment in Osu Castle, apologizing to both for the fact that their Ghanaian plane could not return them home due to technical difficulties in landing and announcing that the country would acquire two special purpose planes from Brazil. In appreciation of the band, Mills said: \\"Your performance made us very proud. On behalf of the Government and people of Ghana, I say a very big thank you for your exceptional performance\\". In August 2012, Colonel Sampson Paa-Kwesi Ebonyi (the then director of music of the band) was a guest conductor for the United States Air Force Band. The two bands have also performed together during the former's visit to Ghana in the mid-2010s. Military bands in Ghana today are divided between three units, the AFCB, the Ghana Navy Band, and the Ghana Air Force Band (representing the Army, Navy and Air Force respectively). The AFCB is supported in training by the Armed Forces Music School.

Headquartered in Pozna≈Ñ, Poland, it's a globally operating business, with local offices including Warsaw, Krak√≥w, Wroc≈Çaw, Gda≈Ñsk and Bia≈Çystok. It provides software design and product design, both for early- stage startups and corporations. Since 2013, Netguru declares yearly growth of nearly 100 percent. It landed three times in Deloitte‚Äôs Technology Fast 50 Central Europe ranking, and twice on the ‚ÄúFT 1000,‚Äù the Financial Times‚Äô list of fastest-growing companies in Europe. In 2016, Netguru reached PLN 28.2M () of income, and PLN 5.1M () net profit, closed 2017 with turnover of PLN 40M (), and in 2018, doubled it at around PLN 80M ().  History  = Founding years = Netguru was founded in Pozna≈Ñ, Poland by Wiktor Schmidt (an automation and robotics student at the Pozna≈Ñ University of Technology), Jakub Filipowski (a web designer and philosophy student at the Adam Mickiewicz University in Pozna≈Ñ), and Adam Zygadlewicz (an e-commerce entrepreneur), who met thanks to popularity of Filipowski's blog about the internet Yashke.com (an extension of his and his brother Jan's web design business). The three opened the first coworking space in Poland in a rented office in central Pozna≈Ñ, where they developed websites together, as freelancers. Since September 2007, through their own foundation Fundacja Polak 2.0, they also organized Barcamp Pozna≈Ñ, the first community meetings for innovation enthusiasts and the emerging Polish internet trade, beside other related events: the International Startup Fair Democamp, the ShopCamp workshops, and the Hackfest. On May 8, 2008, their software development business Schmidt, Filipowski and Zygadlewicz registered under the name Netguru. The first web development contracts gained by the new company was the Web 2.0 travel portal Kolumber.pl, for the media publishing corp Agora, and the employer relations portal for Bank Zachodni WBK. During the same time, Netguru also created their own products including the microblogging social platform Flaker, the charity service SiePomaga, and in February 2009, the recruitment support tool HumanWay, later awarded at startup competitions Seedcamp Warsaw and Aulery. Beside creating websites, functional development and community management, the company started offering management consulting and market analysis. Since September 2007, the Netguru team has documented its portfolio, along with analysis of the web development industry, on the official blog (initially, on the separate developer blog Devguru). In September 2010, on the InternetBeta Conference, Zygadlewicz announced the first coworking space for startups and freelance developers in Warsaw. In July 2011, Filipowski, along with entrepreneurs Borys Musielak of Filmaster, and Anna Walkowska of Homplex, moved their businesses together into one mansion in ≈ªoliborz, establishing the Reaktor, which evolved into the first central networking hub in Poland, and the venue for the Warsaw startup scene. At that time, Filipowski managed the Pozna≈Ñ team of HumanWay from the Reaktor, while Schmidt managed all of Netguru remotely from Dublin. In January 2011, Filipowski, by then, a recognized technology blogger, together with Schmidt, contributed the famed guest article on the internet website Antyweb, ‚ÄúThere Will Never Be Another Big ‚ÄòPolish Equivalent‚Äô‚Äù, about the web services Allegro, Gadu-Gadu and Nasza Klasa, as local copycats of the popular American web services ‚Äì EBay, ICQ, and Classmates.com, respectively. The article‚Äôs punch line: ‚ÄúLet's get to work, let's get rid of the complexes, and create models with a global, or at least pan-European potential‚Äù. Following the incentive, in May 2011, Filipowski and Schmidt started a series of articles about the Polish internet market for the news portal Gazeta.pl. = Focus on web development = From 2012, Netguru is developing applications, systems and internet solutions solely in Ruby on Rails. In 2013, HumanWay was acquired by the online recruitment house Grupa Pracuj. Following the transaction, Filipowski returns to Pozna≈Ñ, and Zygadlewicz exits Netguru, to continue organizing entrepreneurship community events under his own brands. Schmidt and Filipowski focus entirely on web development, therefore as a software house, Netguru begins to specialize deeper in applications for British, American, and German startups. In February 2014, Netguru became an official partner for the open-source solution Spree Commerce. At the time, its portfolio included projects for the British market research provider GlobalWebIndex, the global language-learning platform Babbel, and other companies from over 20 countries. In May 2015, for the open content platform and media marketplace Transterra Media, Netguru implemented a mobile app which allows news outlets to manage and publish pre-produced videos. The same year, Netguru formed a team of digital product design specialists which contributed to brands such as IKEA and Volkswagen. It also began to design and build a personal assistant system for a domestic robot created by Temi. = Expansion = In November 2014, Netguru has introduced its relationships onto Israeli and the Middle East markets, to support entrepreneurs from across the UAE & the MENA region. While in August 2015, Netguru became official member of the London fintech community. In 2016, Netguru created a mobile platform that allows renting bicycles, for the American urban bicycle-sharing system Citi Bike. And in 2017, the company developed a digital system Helpr, which connects social care workers with care recipients in the British social care system. Recently, the company has been recording an increase in revenues and growth, with no investment support ‚Äì in 2016, over PLN 30M (60% year-over-year growth); in 2017, about PLN 40M (), and in 2018, around PLN 80M (). In 2013, the company had about 50 employees; in 2016, over 300, and as of the end of 2018, 500 employees all over Poland. Between 2016 and 2018, Netguru reached an EBITDA margin of 15%. In addition to software development, Netguru has been developing its business consulting expertise and market analysis. Since 2017, the company has been prototyping products and building marketing strategies. It has helped large organisations to adopt business agility practices, and innovations with software robots. On June 3, 2019, Netguru's chief operating officer Marek Talarczyk was named the new CEO, with Schmidt including the position of executive chairman, and Ma≈Çgorzata Madali≈Ñska-Piƒôtka joining the board as chief financial officer.  Main activities  Netguru specializes in developing front-end and back-end web applications, mobile applications, product design, and consulting. With nearly 500 employees (as of October 2018), the company manages over 100 projects a year. According to its tagline, the company ‚Äúbuilds digital products that let people do things differently.‚Äù Its portfolio includes SaaS marketplaces, e-commerce, big data systems, trading systems, and social networks. = Web development = Netguru is experienced in developing custom, cloud-based software, using APIs of Amazon Web Services, Heroku, Engine Yard, and DigitalOcean, integrating systems with external platforms, e.g. Salesforce, MailChimp, Google Analytics, and payment providers PayPal, Skrill, PayU and Stripe ‚Äì as well as maintaining multi-server infrastructure including Docker-based virtualized deployments. Since June 2017, Netguru offers dedicated workshops based on design-thinking sprints developed by Google, which are aimed to answer critical business questions through design, prototyping, and testing ideas with customers, to reduce the risk of bringing a new product, service, or feature to the market. = Machine Learning = In May 2018, during the Microsoft machine-learning hackathon in Prague, with the software house MicroscopeIT, Netguru launched an image-recognition application based on a deep-learning technology. The outcome was an app that solves segmentation with neural networks, by detecting unwanted objects or sensitive data in pictures, and cutting them out with a pixel accuracy, using algorithms similar to those used in graphics software. Netguru also partnered with the domestic robotic manufacturer Temi, on building the robotics middleware for the consumer assistant robot which moves freely indoors. A joint team created an operating system using natural language processing and transferring data in the cloud. = Other initiatives = In 2010, Netguru developers created an online platform for the Apps for Good foundation that allows cooperation of teachers, students and experts in schools in the United States, Spain, Portugal, and Poland. The company has also built the application Smoke Detector, which takes data of a project captured in the customer relationship platform Salesforce, and with a machine-learning algorithm identifies which projects are likely to have issues, with a potential cause.  Mergers and acquisitions  In December 2017, in its first transaction, Netguru took over a team of developers and designers from the Internet-of-things company Vorm. In May 2018, Netguru merged with the IT support and DevOps provider ITTX, and in July 2018, it acquired the software house Bitcraft. As of June 2018, further acquisitions of larger and smaller entities are planned. Netguru is reportedly considering a debut on the Warsaw Stock Exchange and wants to consolidate the software market in Poland, by surpassing the current IT leader, the banking software provider Asseco.  Original publications  = Professional guides = In April 2016, a team of Netguru project managers compiled Project Management Tactics for Pros, an e-book with guidance on IT projects, including preparation and budget. The publication covers tactics, strategies and methodologies on management, processes, communication and motivation. In June 2018, Netguru's designers team published Design Process for Pros, a live e-book actively curated by the designers community, with a set of best practices in web design projects. Another e-book guide From Concept to Completion from March 2018, is an Agile software consulting walk- through, for understanding software development processes and tried-and-true techniques including preparatory work, setting a team, and mapping out a project. In July 2016, Netguru published the London Startup Guide, a guide on tech business events, meetups, business incubators and communities of London. Consultants encourage to run a startup based in London, and present rules of doing business in the United Kingdom, based on successful startups and influencers. = State of Stack = In March 2016, Netguru, in collaboration with the survey-building service Typeform, released State of Stack, a report of the latest trends in web development, based on data from the study of the developer community. The study allowed to compare skills of each developer with the most desirable skills on the market. = Publishing effort = In November 2017, Netguru announced an online publication about business, technologies and management, with former economic journalist Tomasz Grynkiewicz, as the chief editor.  Educational events  = Netguru Code College = With a vision of transferring knowledge and experience, the company organizes the Netguru Code College, free summer workshops for coding enthusiasts who are walked through processes of building a web application in a real working environment, by professionals who develop apps on a daily basis. The workshops which introduced Ruby on Rails took place in August 2017 and February 2018, and the weekend edition dedicated to React Native took place in March 2018. = Disruption Forum = In April 2018, Netguru hosted the Disruption Forum in Berlin, a meeting of the fintech community which turned into a regular fintech startup event. The idea is to engage experts who actively shape the fintech landscape in a constructive discussion about the future of fintech. = Meetups, workshops and webinars = Since August 2013, Netguru have coached Ruby on Rails around Poland, at free practical workshops aimed at developers who use PHP, Java, and .NET frameworks, or other languages on a daily basis but would like to learn Ruby on Rails, and the Level Up workshops for more advanced developers. Additionally, since 2015, Netguru have hosted weekend hackathons in its Poznan headquarters, and regular Ruby on Rails student workshops at the Katowice Institute of Information Technologies. Since February 2015, Netguru managers have organized regular free project management workshops. Since April 2017, Netguru has hosted a regular designers event Dribbble Meetup, gathered around the social platform for designers Dribbble, as well as the Swift Poznan meetings and the PTAQ meetings. Netguru has also cooperated with universities, by hosting workshops and presentations, involving in academic life, and during monthly webinars for technology enthusiasts.  Trademark registration dispute  In 2014, the company filed an application to the European Union Intellectual Property Office, for the registration of the EU trade mark ‚ÄúNetguru,‚Äù in several classes related to computer services. However, it was rejected due to the lack of distinctiveness of the name. The company appealed to the General Court of the European Union, which dismissed the complaint, considering that the combination of the words \\"net\\" and \\"guru\\" appeared as advertising, nor it doesn't allow the target public to perceive the sign as an indication of the commercial origin of the goods and services in question.  Awards and accolades  Netguru is a three- time winner of the Fast 50 Central Europe competition where the accounting network Deloitte recognizes and profiles the 50 most dynamic technology companies in the region, based on the revenue growth over past five years. Netguru was ranked 5 in 2014, and 2015, and received the third award in 2017. Netguru landed twice on the ‚ÄúFT 1000,‚Äù the list of Europe's fastest-growing companies in Europe according to Financial Times, in 2017 (ranked 188), and in 2018 (ranked 466).

In 2014, Netguru was named Top Ruby on Rails Developers, by the American market analysis firm Clutch, in the report on Market Leaders, based on in-depth interviews with clients. Then again in August 2017, Clutch named Netguru as one of the best outsourcing companies in the industry. In 2018, Schmidt and Filipowski were among Polish finalists of the Ernst & Young Entrepreneur of the Year Award competition. In 2011, Netguru wins the Aulery award, as one of the best tech companies with global potential.

In 1904 she passed to the White Star Line and was renamed Cufic, the name she retained until she was sold to Italian ownership in 1924, after which she became known as Antartico then Maria Guilia until being scrapped in 1932. Design and construction The American was launched at Belfast on 8 August 1895, and delivered to the West India and Pacific Steamship Company on 8 October. She was principally a cargo ship, but also had accommodation for 60 steerage passengers. She was powered by two triple-expansion steam engines which could propel the ship to a maximum service speed of . Career The American started her maiden voyage from Liverpool to New Orleans on 9 October 1895, and on her arrival there, was loaded with a cargo of cotton. In 1898, she was chartered by the Atlantic Transport Line and placed on their New Orleans to Baltimore cargo service. This lasted until 1900, when the entire 20 ship fleet of the West India and Pacific Steamship Company was bought by the Leyland Line. The same year American was requisitioned as a war transport for the Boer War. In 1902 the Leyland Line and the White Star Line were taken over by the International Mercantile Marine Co. (IMMCo) which set about transferring ships between its subsidiary companies in order to increase efficiency. In 1903 the American was deployed on the White Star Line's Liverpool to New York service, and the following year she was sold internally within the IMMCo group to White Star Line, and renamed Cufic, making her the second White Star ship to bear that name. Her sister ship the European was also sold to White Star and renamed Tropic. Cufic and Tropic were then deployed on the White Star's Australian service from Liverpool to Sydney, principally for cargo, but also with some berths for steerage passengers. In this role they supplemented White Star's five Jubilee Class ships on the Australian service. After the outbreak of World War I in 1914 Cufic was commandeered as a war transport and fitted with two 4.7 inch guns. In March 1917, she was taken up under the Liner Requisition Scheme, but was released back into commercial service in September 1919, following which she returned to the Australian service, however a decline in trade on this route in the early 1920s, meant that Cufic was withdrawn from service and laid up at Liverpool on 24 August 1923. Later that year she was sold for scrapping to G.B.A Lombardo of Genoa, Italy and in December she set sail for that port. On her arrival on 24 January 1924, she was sold again to Soc. Anon. Ligure di Nav, A Vapore of Genoa who returned her to service and renamed her Antartico. In 1927 she was sold again within Italy to E. Bozzo & L. Mortola and again renamed Maria Guilia. They operated her until 2 April 1930, when she was laid up for disposal. In November 1932 she was scrapped at Genoa.

He was born in Paris, the son of filmmakers Diane Kurys and Alexandre Arcady; he is the half-brother of film director Alexandre Aja. He attended the √âcole alsacienne up to baccalaureat level, but abandoned undergraduate literary studies to devote himself to writing. His first novel, Mes illusions donnent sur la cour, was published in 2009. The title of the novel was taken from a song by Serge Gainsbourg and traces the life of a high school student from a wealthy Parisian background - his love life, his difficult relationship with his parents, skipping classes at school, alcohol, drug abuse‚Ä¶ His second novel, Les C≈ìurs en ska√Ø mauve, was published by Fayard in 2011. The title is taken from Philippe Djian‚Äôs novel 37¬∞2 le matin which tells the story of a summer romance between an aspiring writer and an impulsive young woman. His third novel, J'ai perdu tout ce que j'aimais, was published by Fayard Press in September 2013. The title refers to a song by French singer and songwriter Alain Souchon. This work is largely autobiographical and recounts Sperling‚Äôs life following the success of his first work. His fourth novel, Histoire de petite fille, came out in 2016; Sperlind said \\"for the first time I have tried to avoid writing about myself, about my personal life, but have tried to be a writer rather than someone undergoing analysis.\\" The novel tells the story of the rapid rise to fame of a young female porn star in Los Angeles. The book was nominated for the prix Renaudot in the spring of 2016. In 2017, Sperling co-wrote the screenplay for a film made by his mother, Ma m√®re est folle. The comedy follows the exploits of a rather eccentric mother (played by Fanny Ardant), and her young son (played by the singer Vianney).

Life Mina Robinson was most likely born in Belfast, though nothing is known about her early life. From the early 1890s Robinson starts holding art classes from her home in Cliftonville, and then from 1894 from the Garfield Chambers. The classes were known as the Belfast school of pokerwork, and from these classed the Irish Decorative Art Association was created by Robinson and Eta Lowry. Irish Decorative Art Association The original purpose of the Association was to promote their work as well as their fellow artists. In July 1894 the group held their first exhibition at Portrush, which became an annual event. This initial exhibition was praised by the Belfast News Letter. Robinson exhibited pokerwork design and a 17th century style chest, with Lowry exhibiting art needlework. In 1895 at the Belfast Art and Industrial Exhibition, Robinson exhibited a decorated oak settle. It is most likely the same piece that she later exhibits at the Arts and Crafts Society of Ireland exhibition in Dublin in the same year. It has been concluded that a settle which is now in the collections of the Ulster Folk and Transport Museum is probably this piece. Over time the school's scope broadened, with members showing chairs, panels, mantelpieces, music stands and friezes. In the early years, the pieces showed strong influence from Art Nouveau, but from the 1890s more Celtic patterns appear. Some of pieces from the 1903 show were purchased by the group's patron Lady Londonderry for her estate at Mount Stewart, County Down. The group's success continued, moving from Garfield Chambers to Wellington Place by 1910. After this point, no more is known about Robinson's life.

It stars Kunaal Roy Kapur, Karishma Sharma, Zeishan Quadri, Jaideep Ahlawat, Rajesh Sharma, and Zakir Hussain. Based on the \\"anti-Romeo squads\\" formed by the Yogi Adityanath ministry in Uttar Pradesh, the film was shot in Kanpur and Unnao. It was released on 16 November 2018 and received poor critical reception. Plot The film begins with news clips reporting on how the anti- Romeo squads formed in the state of Uttar Pradesh, tasked with preventing Eve teasing and harassment of women at public places, are harassing young couples in the name of morality. Goldie Kaushik (Jaideep Ahlawat), the leader of Bharat Nirmaan Party's Youth Wing in Kanpur, beats up young couples seen together in the name of protecting Indian culture. Given his political position, police officer ACP Yadav helps him in his activities. Vipul (Kunaal Roy Kapur) is chastised by his father for his joblessness and loitering around the city, while his girlfriend Shaheen (Karishma Sharma) does not like his opposition to Kaushik, ultimately breaking up with him for this reason. Desperate to win back her affection and earn money, Vipul along with his friend Saurabh (Zeishan Quadri) decides to open a hotel for young couples. Together they rent an old lodge owned by Saurabh's uncle (Zakir Hussain) and make him a partner in their hotel named \\"Hotel Milan: Khilte Hain Gul Yahan Khil Ke Bikharne Ko\\". They charge customers on hourly basis and very soon the hotel becomes a popular destination for young couples to spend time together without the fear of anti-Romeo squads and public shaming. The trio is reaping a huge profit daily and Shaheen makes up with Vipul. Shaheen and Vipul book a room in the hotel on Valentine's Day but instead go to a nearby dargah on Shaheen's insistence. In Vipul's absence, Kaushik reaches the hotel with his goons. They vandalise the premises and beat up Saurabh and his uncle. Kaushik's goons drag out the couples from their rooms and thrash them mercilessly. Vipul and Shaheen return to find the hotel ransacked. Together they help admit the injured to a nearby hospital and deliberate on their next step. The incident gains huge media coverage and Vipul is invited to one such discussion on television, where he is disheartened by the repeated haggling of Kaushik and another politician. Vipul returns home and informs his friends and family that he is going to file a case against Kaushik and ACP Yadav for vandalising his hotel and beating up his customers and staff. They engage the services of Guptaji (Rajesh Sharma), a lawyer who has not a won a single case until then and is depressed because his wife ran away with his servant. During the court trial, Kaushik has a case filed against Vipul for running an immoral place and sends goons to Guptaji's house to intimidate him. The latter manages to get over his distress over his wife and presents an incriminating witness in court who had seen Kaushik and his goons beating up young couples outside Milan Hotel and vandalising it. In its judgement, the court comments that the Hotel Milan had been vandalised in a planned conspiracy. It instructs police to suspend ACP Yadav and set up an inquiry against him. To Kaushik, the court awards a fine of and orders him to pay to the owners of Hotel Milan in compensation. At the end of the film Vipul joins Kaushik's party, stating that his fight against Kaushik was not a personal one. Cast * Kunaal Roy Kapur as Vipul * Karishma Sharma as Shaheen * Zeishan Quadri as Saurabh * Jaideep Ahlawat as Goldie Kaushik * Rajesh Sharma as Guptaji * Zakir Hussain as Chachaji * Malvi Malhotra as Sapna Production After the formation of the Yogi Adityanath ministry in Uttar Pradesh, anti-Romeo squads were set up to prevent Eve teasing, ensure the safety of women at public places, and \\"create fear among potential harassers\\". However, the squads drew criticism when videos of them harassing young couples surfaced in the media. Vishal Mishra came up with a story based on these anti-Romeo squads and approached Haresh Patel of AD Films, who agreed to produce it after the first narration. Mishra described it as \\"quite a daring film\\". Kunaal Roy Kapur, Karishma Sharma, Zeishan Quadri, and Jaideep Ahlawat were cast in the film. When questioned by the media regarding the controversial subject matter, Misha responded that he was not expecting any protest against the film. Principal photography began in Kanpur, Uttar Pradesh, on 18 July 2017. For the hotel scenes, an old bungalow was renovated by the filmmakers. Hotel Milan marked the first film of Karishma Sharma in a leading role. She had previously been seen in Pyaar Ka Punchnama 2. Some of the scenes were shot in Unnao. A.B. Vidyalaya Inter College, Mall Road, was used for the court scenes while location shooting was also done at Guptar Ghat, Swaroop Nagar, Moti Jheel, and Birhana Road. In total, the film crew spent 35 days in Kanpur and cast local actors in supporting roles. Kapur and Mishra would later come together for Marudhar Express (2019). Release The film's initial release date was 14 September 2018, which was later changed to 26 October 2018. However, the film was further delayed due to late certification from the Central Board of Film Certification (CBFC), which would not grant an A certificate until footage involving Yogi Adityanath was removed, despite it previously being cleared for use in its trailer. Mishra removed the video but kept Adityanath's audio in the film. The film was eventually released on 16 November 2018, a week following Diwali. Soundtrack The soundtrack album was composed by Harshit Saxena, Kashi- Richard, Amjad Nadeem, Enbee & Ruchit H Patel. Reception Pallabi Dey Purkayastha of The Times of India gave the film 1.5 out of 5 stars. She called Quadri's character the \\"only saving grace\\" of the film, which to her was \\"as shady as a love hotel\\". She stated that Kapur was a \\"misfit\\" who struggled with the Kanpur accent and Sharma was \\"outrageously overdressed\\". Purkayastha felt that the plot's novelty was the only thing \\"[working] in favour of the director\\". Writing for the Mumbai Mirror, Kunal Guha was critical of the film and gave it a 1-star rating, calling it a film with low \\"production values\\" and a \\"kind of project you'd not wish on your worst enemy\\". He felt that the film was poor on the technical front and that some of the staff might have \\"walked off the project midway\\", putting more pressure on the staff that remained. He likened the film to \\"mediocre sitcoms\\" for its \\"jarring laughter track\\". On the film's characters, Guha noted that Quadri was \\"barely tolerable\\" and Kapur's acting was \\"[discomforting]\\". He advised Ahlawat to be careful while reviewing a film's script.

He had also been convicted of robbery, kidnapping and escape from prison.  Biography  Maurizio Minghella was born in Genoa in 1958, living in Val Polcevera, Bolzaneto district. When he was six, his mother separated from her husband and took care of the five children by herself. Later, she married to a new man who beat the entire family. Minghella began to deeply hate his stepfather, defining it later, during his first interrogation, with these words: He attended school without being able to pass the second grade, and at age 12 he still attended the first grade. At school he took his companions by their necks and dragged them by their noses or mouths. Leaving school, he began to do small jobs including being a tiler, even though he often stole scooters, motorbikes and cars on the roads of Val Polcevera and the surrounding areas. Minghella was always seen with different girls and had been nicknamed the \\"Travolta of Val Polcevera\\" for his passion towards disco music.Article by La Stampa Accessed on October 22, 2008 He was also passionate about boxing, but was driven away from it after he was beaten in a match. An event that heavily impacted his psyche was the death of his brother, who died in a car crash. Following this, Minghella began to develop a morbid attraction for the dead. Reformed by the conscription service for mental disorders, he married in 1977 \\"by chance, by chance\\", as he himself declared, 15-year-old Rosa Manfredi, who was dependent on psycotropic drugs. Their marriage was short-lived: Minghella frequently visited prostitutes, and the girl died after a drug overdose after suffering depression and a miscarriage. This further traumatized Minghella and his fragile personality. In 1978, he visited the psychiatric clinic of the University of Genoa, learning that his IQ was 70.  The first murders  On April 18, 1978, Minghella killed a prostitute named Anna Pagano in Genoa, then hiding her corpse in the Sant'Olcese comune. The corpse was found by some shepherds, its head smashed and with a ballpoint pen embedded in the anus. Minghella also tried to misdirect the investigation by writing \\"Bricato Rose\\" instead of \\"Brigate Rosse\\" on the body, committing a spelling error which was immediately noticed by the police. On July 8, he killed Giusepinna Jerardi in Genoa in the same way and hid the body in a stolen abandoned car. On July 18, he killed 14-year-old Maria Catena \\"Tina\\" Alba, whose naked body was found in Valbrevenna the next day, tied with a garrote to a tree. On August 22, after a night at the disco, he killed 21-year-old Maria Strambelli, a saleswoman from Bari, whose body was found 3 days after her disappearance in the outskirts of Genoa. The last victim was 19-year-old Wanda Scerra, a friend of Strambelli, who disappeared on November 28. Her raped and strangled corpse was found in the escarpment that runs along the Genoa-Milan railway near Genoa.  First arrest, trial and imprisonment  Minghella was arrested on the night between December 5 and 6, confessing to the murders of Strambelli and Scerra, but denying his guilt in the others. Calligraphic expertise was required due to the attempted misdirection on Pagano's body. Both the writing and the pen used to sodomize the victim were connected back to Minghella. For the murder of Alba, a pair of glasses belonging to Minghella were found at the crime scene. On April 3, 1981, he was sentenced by the Assizes court of Genoa to life imprisonment for five homicides, which was to be served at the maximum security prison in Porto Azzurro. In prison he always proclaimed his innocence and in the eighties also requested a revision of the trial through Andrea Gallo. In 1995, at the age of 37, he obtained semi-liberty and was transferred to the Vallette prison in Turin. He entered the recovery community of Luigi Ciotti, and worked as a carpenter for the Abele Group.  Murders between 1997 and 2001  In March 1997, Minghella killed 53-year-old Loredana Maccario in a woman's home in the Turin neighborhood of San Salvario. She was a sex worker. In May, 20-year-old Moroccan Fatima H'Didou was raped and then strangled with the snare of a tracksuit in Caselette. She was a sex worker. On February 14, 1998, he strangled 29-year-old Albanian Floreta Islami with a scarf in Rivoli. She was a sex worker. On January 30, 1999, he strangled 73-year-old Cosima \\"Gina\\" Guido, from Taranto, with a scarf, in her apartment in the center of Turin. On the stairs of the woman's pied-√†-terre two pieces of a kitchen towel with organic traces belonging to Minghella were found. She too was a sex worker. 27-year-old mother of two children Florentina \\"Tina\\" Motoc was killed on the night between February 16 and 17, 2001. She bruised brutally to the face and head, with Minghella attempting to get rid of her clothes by starting a small bonfire.Tab on Tina Motoc in the Mysteries section of Who saw it? - Edition 2000/2001 Due to the last murder, Minghella's DNA traces, complete or partial impressions found in the places of the crimes, the similar modus operandi and the time slot in which the murders occurred (all after 5 o'clock), lead to the authorities arresting him.  Second arrest and trial  Minghella was arrested on March 7, 2001, and the victims' cell phones were found with their registration numbers deleted. His own cell phone was traced to the area where Motoc was located at the evening of the crime. Imprisoned in the Vallette prison, he tried to escape from through the laundry in the spring of 2001, but managed to get to the first wall only. He was transferred to the Biella prison, and on the morning of January 2, 2003, he was hospitalized for chest and arm pain in the town's emergency room, managing to escape from through a bath. Minghella was recaptured at 10 PM the same day near the train station. Suspected in the murders of tens of victims who had worked as sex workers, but convicted for only four of them, on April 4, 2003 Maurizio Minghella was sentenced to life imprisonment by the Turin Assizes Court for the murder of Motoc and to 30 years for the murders of Guido and H'Didou. He is serving his sentence in a prison in Pavia.

In 1904 she passed to the White Star Line and was renamed Tropic, the name she retained until she was sold to Italian ownership in 1924, after which she became known as Artico then Transilvania until being scrapped in 1933. Design and construction The European was launched at Belfast on 9 July 1896. She was principally a cargo ship, but also had accommodation for 60 steerage passengers. She was powered by two triple-expansion steam engines which could propel the ship to a maximum service speed of . Career The European started her maiden voyage on 9 January 1897, between Liverpool and New Orleans and would remain serving this route for the next three years until 1900, when she was requisitioned as a war transport for the Boer War. The same year the entire 20 ship fleet of the West India and Pacific Steamship Company was bought by the Leyland Line. In 1902 the Leyland Line and the White Star Line were taken over by the International Mercantile Marine Co. (IMMCo) which set about transferring ships between its subsidiary companies in order to increase efficiency. In 1904 European was sold internally within the IMMCo group to White Star Line, and renamed Tropic, making her the second White Star ship to bear that name. Her sister ship the American was also sold to White Star and renamed Cufic. Tropic and Cufic were then deployed on the White Star's Australian service from Liverpool to Sydney, principally for cargo, but also with some berths for steerage passengers. In this role they supplemented White Star's five Jubilee Class ships on the Australian service. On 29 June 1905, Tropic was badly damaged after running aground 15 miles north of Constituci√≥n, Chile, presumably whilst returning to the UK from Australia via the Pacific. Her Second Officer and Purser reportedly drowned. After being refloated five days later it was found that the bottom of the ship had buckled and dislodged the boilers and machinery. On 12 December 1908 she collided with the Argonaut Steam Navigation Company's coaster Wyoming. After the outbreak of World War I in 1914 Tropic initially remained in commercial service to Australia, but was taken up under the Liner Requisition Scheme between 30 June 1917 and 10 July 1919. Following this she returned to the Australian service, however a decline in trade on this route in the early 1920s, meant that Tropic was withdrawn from service and sold in December 1923 to Ditta L. Pittaluga of Genoa, Italy. In January the following year she was sold again within Italy to 'Soc. Anon. Ligure di Nav, A Vapore' along with her sister Cufic and was renamed Artico. Three years later she was sold back to Ditta L. Pittaluga who renamed her Transilvania, she remained in service with them until 2 February 1930, after which she was laid up for disposal at Genoa, where she was scrapped three years later.

It had several influences, especially from the artist's stay in Italy. The painting is divided into two halves, one showing a virtuous way of life leading a faithful person to the Kingdom of God and the other an evil way of life leading to Hell. Orsel uses religious imagery and Latin words to intensify the impact of the moral. Orsel used medieval techniques and religious themes not used by other contemporary paintings, though he combined them with Masonic elements. First exhibited at the Paris Salon of 1833, the critics noted the work for its didactic and \\"archaic\\" character. Th√©ophile Gautier compared it to Orcana, Pinturicchio and \\"other artists of the angelic school\\", whilst Le Go assessed Orsel's style as closer to that of the Nazarenes. The work's detractors emphasised the odd juxtaposition of imitation of medieval paintings with the lack of any religious sentiments - Auguste Jal called it a \\"profane polyptych\\", whilst the Protestant Athanase Coquerel fils criticised Orsel for his lack of convictions and sensibility and for his not \\"being followed by his faith\\".

Lincoln developer Dick Youngscap surveyed several thousand acres of land in 1990 and worked with Coore and Crenshaw to survey the land and find an ideal spot for the course. After two years of surveying the land, Coore, Crenshaw, and Youngscap built Sand Hills on 130 acres. $1.2 million was spent building the course, far less than other highly rated modern golf courses.

Early life Olliver was born in the parish of St Ouen on 2 June 1884. He was the son of French farmer Pierre Olliver (1859-1914) and Jerseywoman Eliza Le Cornu (1859-1934), who married around 1879. They had eleven children, three of whom died in infancy. Alfred's known siblings were Peter (b. 1880), Eliza Jane (b. 1882), Henry (b. 1886), Hilda (b. 1888), Mary Ann (b. 1890), Eliza Jane (b. 1896), William (b. 1898), John (b. 1899) and Francis John (b. 1901). In 1891 he and his family were living at Green Vales in St Brelade, moving to St Nicholas by 1901. Alfred went to sea at age 16, joining the Royal Navy and was stationed at the Royal Marine Barracks in Alverstoke, Hampshire. After seven years in the Royal Navy he joined the Merchant service. RMS Titanic On the night of the sinking, Olliver was at the ship's wheel until 10pm at which time he was relieved by Robert Hichens. He was running messages for the officers and returned to the wheelhouse as the ship hit the iceberg. He was ordered to find the carpenter and check the level of the water but found him already doing so. He then took a message to the Chief Engineer and delivered a message to Captain Edward Smith. He was ordered by the Chief Officer to tell the boatswain to prepare the lifeboats. He entered a lifeboat with Third Officer Herbert Pitman and 5 other crew, along with about 35 passengers, mostly women and children. Olliver ensured the plug was in the lifeboat ensuring it did not get swamped and capsize. He later gave evidence at the United States Senate inquiry into the sinking of the RMS Titanic. Death Olliver returned to England and continued to work for White Star Line but did not return to sea. He died on 18 June 1934 in St Saviour and was buried in an unmarked grave in St Saviour's Churchyard. His grave was given a headstone in 2012 in commemoration of the 100th anniversary of the sinking. Personal life He married Amelia Gertrude Perkins (born 11 May 1883 in Southampton) in 1910. They had three children, Alfred (b. 1911), William (b. 1914) and Hilda (b. 1916).

Consisting of period woodwork from late 15th century Italy, the studio was commissioned for Federico da Montefeltro.  History  As the Renaissance swept through Italy, the cultural movement caused the rebirth and development of numerous artistic styles. Among these concepts was the development of the studiolo, a secluded room intended to allow for quiet study and mediation. These rooms contained, either physically or in the form of artistic depictions, books, tomes, scientific instruments, and other symbols of knowledge, particularly if they were associated Classical Greece or Rome.Peck, Amelia, James Parker, William Rieder, Olga Raggio, Mary B. Shepard, Annie-Christine Daskalakis Mathews, Dani√´lle O. Kisluk-Grosheide, Wolfram Koeppe, Joan R. Mertens, Alfreda Murck, and Wen C. Fong (1996). Period Rooms in The Metropolitan Museum of Art. Metropolitan Museum of Art. Print. New York, New York. pp. 41-47 Elaborately decorated with paintings and intricate woodwork, studioli became a sign of status and sophistication for the nobility, court officials, and artists of the Italian Renaissance. The small rooms would later be known as a hallmark of the Quattrocento, the art movement encompassing the first 100 years of the Italian Renaissance. The studiolo housed in the Met was commissioned by Duke Federico da Montefeltro, a major geopolitical force in North-Central Italy during his lifetime. In addition for being a capable military leader, Federico was noted for being a prolific patron of the arts; his activities, such as the employing of artists, architects, and writers resulted in him being given the moniker \\"the Light of Italy\\". Federico commissioned his first studiolo at his palace in Urbino, the House of Montefltro's traditional seat of power; this feat was replicated when in 1478 he ordered the design and installation of a studiolo in an old palace he was rebuilding in Gubbio, which was under his control. The new room was designed by Sienese artist Francesco di Giorgio Martini, who also worked on a number of other projects for da Montefeltro, including the construction of the Palazzo ducale di Gubbio (where the studiolo was installed) itself.Weller, Allen Stuart (1943). Francesco di Giorgio, 1439‚Äì1501. Chicago: The University of Chicago Press. pp. 1‚Äì44. Martini's design was executed (under his supervision) by two Tuscan brothers famed for their work with interior woodworking, Giuliano and Benedetto da Maiano. The entire room was constructed in the da Maiano's workshop in Florence, after which it was transported to Gubbio for installation. The studiolo remained in the Palazzo at Gubbio until 1874, when it was disassembled and moved to a villa in Frascati. The room was then purchased by a German art dealer and moved to Venice. The Metropolitan Museum of Art acquired the work in 1939 and had the studiolo shipped to New York City, where it was re-assembled between 1939 and 1941.  Description  The studiolo consists of a number of wood panels fitted together. These panels are divided into twelve consecutive sections, surrounding the room on all sides. The artists' use of intarsia (inlaid wood) to render realistic, two- dimensional images of latticework cabinets, drawers, and siding is representative of the rediscovery of linear perspective in mid-15th century Italy. The extensive use of intarsia is particularly noticeable in the room, as the inlaid wood forms the contrast used to create the illusion of depth. In addition, paint and more intarsia is used to depict objects that a leader of Renaissance period would be expected to have in their study. Objects depicted include measuring instruments, a tropical bird in a cage, armor, books, and musical instruments. The studiolo's coffered wood ceiling is adorned with carved geometric designs. The room originally contained several paintings, but these were removed from the studiolo in the 17th century. Three windows provide lighting for the room. A phrase, done in gold-on-blue frieze along the upper panels of the room, reads; \\"You see the eternal nurselings of the venerable mother, men pre-eminent in learning and genius, How they fall with bared neck before ‚Ä¶knee. Honored loyalty prevails over justice, and no one Repents having yielded to his foster mother.\\"  Gallery  File:Studiolo from the Ducal Palace in Gubbio MET DT237370.jpgVarious cabinets, doors open or ajar, filled with objects of note.

Some authorities point to a line at the end of this inscription which has been read as Geta cos and assumed to refer to either Publius Septimius Geta, consul II in 203, or Geta, son of emperor Septimus Severus and consul in 205. If this identification is correct, this inscription refers to an otherwise unknown consul who lived in the late second century/early third. On the other hand, Werner Eck has offered arguments against a later date, pointing out that the letters in question have also been read as IRISE [...] CETACO, as well as arguing that it would make better sense for this inscription to be carved during the emperor Hadrian's visit in 128.Eck, \\"Erg√§nzungen zu den Fasti Consulares des 1. und 2. Jh.n.Chr.\\", Historia: Zeitschrift f√ºr Alte Geschichte, 24 (1975), pp. 329-333  Career  Assuming the inscription at Luxor refers to this Faustus, his cursus honorum is as follows. He began his career as one of the decemviri stlitibus judicandis, one of the four boards that form the vigintiviri; membership in one of these four boards was a preliminary and required first step toward gaining entry into the Roman Senate. This was followed as sevir equitum Romanorum, or the annual review of the equites. Faustus then received a commission as a military tribune with Legio III Augusta, stationed at Theveste (present day T√©bessa). He returned to Rome where he was elected quaestor, and upon completion of this traditional Republican magistracy he would be enrolled in the Senate. Two more of the traditional Republican magistracies followed: plebeian tribune and praetor. Upon stepping down from the praetorship, Faustus received another military commission, this time as legatus or commander of Legio XIII Gemina, stationed at Apulum in the imperial province of Dacia; Werner Eck dates his tenure as commander of this legion to between the years 106 and 119.Eck, \\"Erg√§nzungen zu den Fasti Consulares\\", p. 333 Two inscriptions, one an altar dedicated to the god Mercury, independently confirm Faustus as commander of this legion., Normal practice was to also allocate a province to a senator of praetorian rank to govern for about three years, but much of the rest of the inscription on the Colossi of Memnon, is lost so it is uncertain if that was the case with Faustus. Because priestly offices appear at the beginning of the list of his offices, we know Faustus was co-opted into the Septemviri epulonum, one of the four most prestigious ancient Roman priesthoods, as well as the sodales Augustales. The rest of his life is a blank except for one event: the inscribing of the text at Luxor. The simplest explanation for this inscription was that Faustus carved it himself, attesting that he had been a member of Hadrian's entourage visiting Egypt in 128. However, there is no reason it had not been created by one of his relatives or friends after Faustus' death for reasons unknown.  Family  Information about his family is uncertain. A tombstone found at Rome commemorates Marcus Fabius Faustus, the son of a Marcus Herennius Faustus and Fabia Felicia; the Herennius Faustus mentioned in this inscription may be the same individual as the consul, but identification is not certain.

Description and history The Chatfield Farmstead is located in far northwestern Woodbridge, at the northwest corner of Seymour Road (Connecticut Route 67) and Bear Hill Road. It is set of land, surrounded in part by farmlands historically associated with it. The main house, a Gothic Revival frame structure is set near the street corner, and the barn is set just to its north. The house is a rambling structure with multiple roof gables, a projecting window bay with decorative panels, and Stick style applied woodwork in some of the gables. It was built about 1880 for Henry Chatfield, who inherited the land from his father. The farm property was sold out of the Chatfield family in 1923, and the farmstead was subdivided from the bulk of the land in 1976. The barn is a three-level bank barn, measuring about , with its long axis perpendicular to the road. Although this size is large in comparison to other surviving barns in the area, it is but 1/3 of its greatest size. It was greatly reduced in size in the 1970s, when a portion added in support of a dairy operation was removed.

His life is not well-documented and there is uncertainty about the date and place of his death. His only surviving building is the small Chapel of the Tomb of St Francis Xavier on Shangchuan Island, southwest of Guangzhou. Life Achille-Antoine Hermitte was born in Paris in 1840 in Paris. There are no records of his parents or childhood. He attended the √âcole Royale d'Architecture de Paris, part of the Acad√©mie des Beaux-Arts, a school that was not known for developing original architects. He graduated in 1860 as a student in the second class. There is no record that he received any prizes. Early in his career he was apprenticed to Douillard fr√®res(fr)(fr) of Nantes. Hermitte was involved in construction of the Roman Catholic Cathedral of the Sacred Heart of Jesus in Guangzhou (Canton), China, but his role is unclear. Eudore de Colomban in his biography of Z√©phyrin Guillemin, Bishop of Canton, wrote that around 1865 or 1866 a new, 26-year-old architect had arrived, but work on the cathedral was still making little progress. This probably refers to Hermitte. Hermitte seems to have been based in Hong Kong while he did work for the bishop and others. This included a chapel to mark the place where Saint Francis Xavier had died on Shangchuan Island, southwest of Canton. It replaced a ruined memorial to the saint. City Hall, Hong Kong (1868) In 1865 Hermitte entered the competition for the design of the Hong Kong City Hall. Around the end of 1865 Hermitte won the competition, in which the selection process was far from transparent. The City Hall and Hermitte's other buildings were erected by skilled Hakka stonemasons from Wuhua in eastern Guangdong. They were probably chosen in part because they were more friendly to foreigners and tolerant of Christianity then other local people. By October 1868 the Hong Kong City Hall was almost finished, although work still continued into the spring of 1869. Prince Alfred, Duke of Edinburgh, opened the building in a ceremony on 28 June 1869. In 1865 a competition for a new gubernatorial palace in Saigon was announced. There were two entries, one of which may perhaps have been Hermitte's. The Governor of Cochinchina, Admiral Pierre-Paul de La Grandi√®re, later made Hermitte head of his architectural department, as recommended by admirals Pierre-Gustave Roze and Gustave Ohier, who had met him in Hong Kong. Hermitte's priority was to design a new Governor's Mansion since the existing wooden building was in disrepair. La Grandi√®re laid the cornerstone for this building on 23 March 1868, a block of blue granite from Bi√™n H√≤a containing a lead coffer that in turn contained newly-minted gold, silver and coin coins of Napoleon III. Work on the huge Saigon Governor's Palace began in earnest when Hermitte brought in skilled workmen from Canton and Hong Kong. The site of the Palais du Gouverneur turned out to be waterlogged and the foundations required constant repair to counteract subsidence throughout the building's life. Most of the materials were imported from France, adding to the cost. Completion of construction was celebrated informally on 25 September 1869 with a banquet and a ball for everyone involved in the project. The final, formal opening of the palace took place in 1873 under Governor Marie Jules Dupr√©. Dupr√© moved into the building that year, and the decorations were completed in 1875. The total cost was 12 million francs, over a quarter of the budget for public works in Cochinchina. In 1869 Hermitte was listed as the architect of the colony, head of the civil buildings service, on leave. Codry was listed as architect, acting head of service. An 1872 account of the H√¥tel du Gouvernment in Saigon states that Hermitte died in Saigon in 1870 and was succeeded by M. Codry. This date and place is uncertain. Around 1870 Bishop Guillemin wrote, \\"... our architect, greatly weakened by his work and his period in Saigon, has just returned to France leaving on our shoulders all of the direction and care of the works of our church (cathedral)\\". Work Old City Hall, Hong Kong, Victoria Harbour in the rear =Hong Kong City Hall= The Hong Kong City Hall was a Victorian- style building on the edge of Victoria Harbour that was meant to be a hub for both cultural and administrative activities. The requirements for the two- storey building included kitchens and rooms for the servants in the basement. The ground floor would have an entrance hall, cloak room, secretary' room and a 500-seat theatre, exclusive of a gallery, with a proscenium-arched stage. The first floor would have St Andrew's Hall, with space for an orchestra, a banqueting hall and an annex that led to the theatre's gallery. The building would also hold a public library that could accommodate 10,000 books and the museum of the South China Branch of the Royal Asiatic Society. According to an editorial in the Hong Kong Daily Press Hermitte's design did not meet all the requirements. The theatre was too small and did not have an entrance from the Praya. The city hall was demolished in 1933. = Chapel of the Tomb of St Francis Xavier= Plan of the Chapel of the Tomb of St Francis Xavier at Shangchuan Dao In early 1867 Bishop Guillemin wrote that, \\"M. Hermitte, our architect, has given us the plan which he wished to donate for St. Francis and one of our missionaries, M. Braud, is presently in place putting it into effect. Although small, the chapel will be beautiful, graceful, and its slender spire will thus raise it from the top of this rock as the soul of the Saint was raised from earth to heaven.\\" The small chapel was ready early in 1869. The bishop wrote that it, \\"only measured about 10 feet long and 30 feet wide, with a small steeple rising 60 feet above; but its Gothic style, its position on a raised rock thrusting into the sea, its slender, pyramidal steeple that dominated all around it gave it a perfect elegance and gracefulness. The chapel was in fact , and the spire rose above the floor. There was a slab in the floor that marked the place where Saint Francis Xavier had died, and there were three small wooden altars, two in niches on the north and south sides and one in the apse. The chapel was consecrated at 8 in the morning on 25 April 1869 in a ceremony attended by about 200 Europeans and 100 Chinese Christians. The chapel was sacked during the Sino-French war of 1884, and badly damaged by a typhoon in 1888-89. It was partially restored in 1910 and 1932. It was again damaged during the Japanese occupation, then neglected until the Taishan district government completely refurbished it in 1986. In 2006 it was again restored to make the 500th anniversary of Saint Francis's birth. =Saigon Governor's Palace = The Saigon Governor's Palace was intended to impress the local people with France's power and wealth. The building was in neo-Baroque style. The walls were in yellow stucco, on foundations of granite imported from France. The facade was decorated by carvings in smooth white stone, also imported. The central pavilion had marble floors, while the other floors were tiled. The palace was T-shaped, and had two rows of arched windows along the front, looking out on the city. Offices and official reception rooms were on the ground floor, with the governor's residential rooms above. The leg of the T held the reception hall and adjoining ballrooms, surrounded by lush foliage. During a coup attempt on 27 February 1962 two airplanes bombed the building and demolished the left wing. The president ordered the whole building demolished and the present Unification Palace was built in its place.

Cicero's passion resurfaced during graduate studies at Northwestern University (MA, Education, 1969), when she took studio art courses with artist and professor George Cohen, and solidified during an art survey course led by Chicago artist Corey Postiglione at the Evanston Art Center in 1973. =Beginnings in Evanston= Through Postiglione's course, Cicero became aware of the large number of local abstract artists working in relative obscurity in the shadow of Imagism, which dominated the city's art scene at the time.Allen, Jane and Derek Guthrie. \\"Cool Abstraction\\".

Clark Street, in a downtown Chicago red-light district being pioneered by a restaurateur, Gordon Sinclair.Assaf-Lynn, Roxane. \\"The Man Who Put River North on the Chicago Map: Albert Friedman,\\" Huffington Post, October 18, 2017. Retrieved July 9, 2018.Baldwin, Peter C. Vice Districts, Encyclopedia of Chicago. Retrieved July 9, 2018. At the time, the city's art scene was beginning to expand beyond being what Franz Schulze deemed \\"a one-corner art town,\\" with alternative galleries, such as N.A.M.E., Artemisia and A.R.C. having opened around the corner on Hubbard Street to avoid the high rents of the established Michigan Avenue/Ontario Street gallery district. N.A.M.E. co- founder and future New York magazine critic Jerry Saltz was one of the gallery's first employees. Cicero's gallery was the first commercial gallery to open in the district and one of the first in the city to exclusively show abstract art. In November 1978, the gallery moved to a larger space on the same block, at 437 N. Clark. By 1983, the gallery looked to expand further, and joined the Richard Gray, Rhona Hoffman, Donald Young, and Zolla/Lieberman galleries in exploring a former warehouse district further north and west that came to be known as River North. It moved that year into larger quarters in a two-story building at 221 W. Erie Street that Cicero and her husband Frank purchased. The move came in advance of a 1980s surge in the art market that saw the number of galleries in Chicago double until a recession-driven slump in 1990 reversed the trend. The gallery weathered that slump, as well as neighborhood tensions between the galleries and small businesses that helped revitalize the district and new investors seeking to rezone the area to open large nightclub and entertainment venues in the late 1980s.McCracken, David. \\"For Landscapes, It\`s Once More With Feeling,\\" Chicago Tribune, November 4, 1987. Retrieved July 3, 2018. The gallery and other River North Association businesses took an active role in the dispute, which involved well-known Chicagoans Walter Payton, restaurateur Rich Melman, and Alderman Burton Natarus on the other side. Their efforts failed; in 1989, the 7,500-foot Walter Payton's American Bar replaced an antique business next door to the gallery. A few years later, a Hooters restaurant opened across the street. In 1999, Cicero decided the neighborhood had changed too much. She sold the building on Erie and moved to a new gallery district west of the Chicago Loop on Washington Street, where she operated until early 2003. =Telluride gallery= In 1987, Cicero and her husband built a home in the mountains outside of Telluride, Colorado. The new locale inspired Cicero to explore the area's regional and Native cultures, and eventually, to show some of the work she discovered. In 1989, she opened a second gallery, in Telluride‚ÄîJan Cicero Gallery at the Golden West, which operated for eight years. The space featured the work of Native American artists, Western and landscape painters, and contemporary abstract artists, as well as ceramics, weaving and regional craft work that contextualized some of the art work. The gallery served as a springboard for Native American and Western artists to attain greater recognition in mainstream art venues beyond the West and for educating the art world about such work.Eiteljorg Museum of American Indians and Western Art. \\"Acknowledgments,\\" Haga (Third Son): An Exhibition of Sculpture, Drawing, and Painting by Winnebago Artist Truman Lowe, Indianapolis, Indiana: Eiteljorg Museum, 1994.Buchholz, Barbara B.

Work and artists exhibited Throughout its operation, Jan Cicero Gallery was known for showing work that was underrepresented or under-appreciated. Cicero has stated that she only showed work that she felt was \\"real and sincere.\\" According to critic Carole Stodder, this often meant work with a concern for surface and formal properties over content or imagery, in which the artist's distinctive mark or process was visible. In a Chicago Reader feature, Cicero said, \\"I wasn't interested in conceptual art, photography, or video. I wasn't trying to have the next big thing. I was showing art that might not have been seen anywhere else.\\" =Abstract work= In its early years, the gallery exclusively showed abstract work that Cicero felt was shortchanged by local critics or museums in favor of the figurative, surrealist-Pop work of the Chicago Imagists. These early shows‚Äîoften the artists' first solo shows‚Äîincluded work by minimalist and geometric painters Martin Hurtig, Tony Giliberto,New Art Examiner. March 1976.

Frustrated by the lack of recognition of these artists, Cicero confronted critic Franz Schulze after a lecture on the Imagists at the exclusive Fortnightly Club, noting during the Q&A;, \\"There are interesting Chicago abstract artists, and you should get to know them.\\" Her early efforts received mixed results; New Art Examiner critics Jane Allen and Derek Guthrie panned an early group show that she curated for the aesthetics of its public setting in a Northwestern University building lobby and for its inclusiveness, despite also noting the presence of \\"some of Chicago's finer abstract artists.\\" Nonetheless, the gallery's abstract artists were soon receiving consistent recognition from the magazine, as well as from newspaper critics like SchulzeHayden, Harold, \\"Drawings, realistic and far-out\\", Chicago Sun Times, Show, June 13, 1977, p.5.Artner, Alan. \\"A Vial Refilled with Intelligence,\\" Chicago Tribune, August 31, 1979. and the Art Institute of Chicago.Art Institute of Chicago.

A decade later, New Art Examiner writers Alice Thorson and Michel Segard both would highlight the gallery as \\"strong supporter of Chicago abstraction\\" over many years, particularly geometric work that in Chicago traced its lineage to the Bauhaus- rooted Institute of Design.Selz, Peter. \\"Modernism Comes to Chicago,\\" in Art in Chicago 1945-1995, Museum of Contemporary Art, ed.

In 1989, inspired by the Telluride scenery, Cicero invited five Midwest landscape painters to paint from her home there, and later exhibited some of the work in both galleries. =Contemporary Native American work= During her time in Telluride, Cicero immersed herself in regional Native American, Hispanic and Western culture. She met artist Jaune Quick-to-See Smith, who introduced her to the work of other Native American artists. That exploration led to numerous shows‚Äîat the Telluride gallery and later in Chicago‚Äîand two major traveling exhibits: \\"Without Boundaries: Contemporary Native American Art\\" (1991) and \\"Native Streams\\" (1996), which featured nineteen artists. The latter show, organized by Cicero and Indiana State University professor and artist Craig McDaniel, and assisted by gallery co-director Kathie Shaw and Craig Zollars, traveled from Chicago to five regional art museums across the country. Well-known Native American artists that the gallery showed include Norman Akers, Rick Bartow, Sara Bates, Joe Feddersen, Ted Garner, Edgar Heap of Birds, Truman Lowe, Mario Martinez, Lillian Pitt, Duane Slick, Bently Spang, Jaune Quick-to- See Smith,Camper, Fred. \\"Self-Expressionism: Jaune Quick-to-See Smith at Jan Cicero Gallery,\\" Chicago Reader, November 10, 1994. Retrieved July 3, 2018. Kay WalkingStick and Emmi Whitehorse. A key aim of the gallery and artists was to present the complex blend of formal training, tribal affiliation and life experience that shaped Native artists' work and to demonstrate the wide range of artistic strategies they employed, resisting trite notions of tradition and authenticity. Reception to the new work wasn't completely positive; some artists felt that it disturbed the purity of the gallery's aesthetic, while others, according to Cicero, were puzzled that the work seemed more like \\"real art\\" than \\"Indian art.\\" Cicero described the work as \\"contemporary art by artists who happen to be [Native American] ‚Ä¶ Some of the work is very political and some of it is very abstract. They're professors at universities, they teach and they just do their work. They're not trying to fit into anybody's stereotype.\\" Critical response was positive; the New Art Examiner's Michael Freeman called \\"Native Streams\\" \\"one of the most successful group shows\\" he'd seen in a long time, unified by grace and subtlety, and lacking in stereotypes. Chicago critics Barbara Buchholz and Fred Camper noted the show's wide range of imagery and artistic expression, from recognizably Native American to the most contemporary. =\\"Rediscovered\\" artists= The gallery frequently sought out late-career artists‚Äîparticularly women‚Äîwho may have been unduly neglected over time, due to changes in style, closed galleries, or personal issues like the demands of raising families. Cicero sometimes called them \\"rediscovered artists.\\" In 1985, the gallery presented new work from veteran Chicago surrealist Evelyn Statsinger, who first came to prominence as a member of the 1950s School of the Art Institute-based \\"Monster Roster,\\" which also included Leon Golub and June Leaf. Statsinger had slipped out of limelight by the 1980s, but reemerged with painstakingly rendered paintings of dense organic patterns in six, well-covered solo shows at the gallery.Kind, Joshua. \\"Evelyn Statsinger,\\" New Art Examiner, March 1986, Vol. 13, p. 52.Yood, James. \\"Evelyn Statsinger, Jan Cicero Gallery,\\" Artforum, January 1990.

Prior to her appointment to the Board of Supervisors, she worked for the San Francisco Office of Economic and Workforce Development and was a legislative aide to former District 5 supervisors Ross Mirkarimi and London Breed. Subsequent to her departure from the Board of Supervisors, Brown ran for the Democratic County Central Committee (DCCC) in the 17th Assembly District.  Early life  Brown grew up in Utah. Her father died when she was one, and she raised by her grandmother and mother. As a child, she experienced housing insecurity, sometimes sleeping with her mother in their car. At the age of 12, she lost her grandmother and her mother died shortly thereafter because she lacked adequate healthcare. Upon her mother's death, she was raised by a combination of neighbors and the families of her friends. Brown studied art at the University of Utah. She moved to San Francisco in 1985.  Career  = Activism = In San Francisco, Brown started an art program at the Hunter's Point Boys and Girls Club; noticing the high incidence of breast cancer and asthma in the neighborhood, she started raising awareness of chemical hazards and became an environmental activist. In 2004, Brown founded the Lower Haight Neighborhood Association. = San Francisco government = Brown served as an aide to Supervisor Ross Mirkarimi of District 5 from 2006 to 2013. She served as aide to Supervisor London Breed from 2013 to 2016. Afterward, she worked as a project manager at the Office of Economic and Workforce Development.  San Francisco Board of Supervisors  Upon her election as mayor in a special election triggered by the death of Mayor Edwin Lee, London Breed appointed Brown to her seat on the Board of Supervisors in July 2018. = Small businesses = Brown proposed a $9 million fund to provide low-interest loans, resources for storefront improvements, and financial assistance for regulatory fees to small businesses. Brown proposed a measure in April 2019 requiring physical store locations to carry cash. The law was passed unanimously by the Board. = Environmental issues = Brown cosponsored legislation to require commercial properties over 50,000 sq. ft. to use 100% renewable energy by 2030, and introduced legislation to mandate that residential buildings over 50,000 sq. ft. report their energy use to the city. Brown worked on legislation to increase San Francisco's tax on plastic bags to 25 cents from 10 cents, and to ban the use of plastic bags in the produce sections of supermarkets. = Public transportation = During the ‚ÄúMuni Meltdown‚Äù of 2018, Supervisor Brown called a hearing on San Francisco's public transportation system. She discovered a shortage of 400 transit operators daily, due to the low wages paid by the city. = Mental health = Working with Supervisor Rafael Mandelman, Brown authorized the creation of a conservatorship program, allowing the city to seek court orders allowing it (or a family member) to intervene in the affairs of people suffering from severe mental illness, directing them into drug addiction or mental health treatment. = Housing and homelessness = Brown spearheaded a $40 million expansion of the Small Sites Program to buy buildings from landlords who were intending to evict their tenants under the Ellis Act in order to sell the building. Under this program, the units are turned into affordable housing. Brown also arranged funding Prop F, which was passed by San Francisco voters in 2018, providing free legal assistance to renters facing eviction. Brown also cosponsored a measure to earmark 50% of the city's revenue from the state's ERAF program to be used on affordable housing. Brown proposed legislation to create a Vehicular Navigation Center, aimed towards people living in their cars. More than 400 people sleep in vehicles on the streets of San Francisco each night. Brown established a program which opens churches to homeless people during the day, allowing them to rest, use restrooms, and access social workers who can assist them. = 2019 special election = In November 2019, Brown lost to Dean Preston in a special election for the San Francisco Board of Supervisors. On May 29, 2020, she announced that she was running again in the November 2020 Board of Supervisor's election.  Personal life  Brown is of Paiute and Shoshone descent. Brown lived mostly in artist's warehouses but often struggled to pay rent during her stints in apartments and houses, facing eviction on multiple occasions. Brown and three other friends entered a tenancy-in-common arrangement and purchased a Victorian home in San Francisco's Lower Haight neighborhood in 1994 through probate court. This purchase, however, evicted several low income African American tenants from the property. Brown alleged on the 2019 campaign trail that the tenants had not paid their rent. She later apologized for falsely accusing them when court documents proved otherwise.

MS 368 ends at its intersection with County Road 700 (CO 700). The route was designated around 1956, connecting MS 2 and MS 15 in Blue Mountain to MS 370 near Dumas. A western extension to MS 5 existed for ten years from 1957 to 1967, and the section east of CO 700 gradually returned to Tippah County for maintenance. Route description All of MS 368 is located in southwestern Tippah County. In 2017, the Mississippi Department of Transportation (MDOT) calculated 570 vehicles traveling on MS 368 near CO 711 on average each day. The route is legally defined in Mississippi Code ¬ß 65-3-3, and it is maintained by MDOT and the town of Blue Mountain inside the city limits, as part of the Mississippi State Highway System. MS 368 starts at the intersection of MS 2 (West Palmer Street) and MS 15 (Guyton Boulevard) in Blue Mountain. The route, known as East Palmer Street inside the town, travels eastward through a residential area. At Academy Street, the road comes to an all-way stop. The street continues uphill to Brown Street, where the route leaves the city limits and state maintenance begins. MS 368 dips southward briefly near CO 711, and it travels over Bald Knob near CO 708. Past the intersection, the route winds southeastward until it reaches CO 710, and the scenery changes from a forested area to farmland near CO 709. MS 368 continues eastward until it ends at a three-way junction at CO 700. History Around 1956, MS 368 was designated onto a gravel road from MS 2 and MS 15 in Blue Mountain to MS 370. The route was extended northwestward to MS 5 a year later. By 1963, a section of the route near MS 370 became county maintained. MS 368 west of Blue Mountain was removed from the state highway system around four years later. A part of MS 368 east of Blue Mountain was paved by 1971, and the route was truncated from MS 370 to a point west of Dumas by 1998.

Centered on the junction of Main Street and Academy Road, the district's architecture is reflective of the town's development over two centuries, and includes many of its civic buildings. It was listed on the National Register of Historic Places in 1986. Description and history The town of Cheshire was settled in 1694 by colonists from adjacent Wallingford, which it remained a part of until incorporating separately in 1780. The town center arose around the location of the first meeting house, where the First Congregational Church (built 1826) now stands. It was a predominantly agricultural community, with the only industry consisting of saw and grist mills serving local needs. It briefly benefited in the mid-19th century from the mining of copper and barite, a time at which it also saw expansion of industry occasioned by improved transportation. In the 20th century it was transformed into a suburban bedroom community. With The historic district is roughly linear in shape, anchored by a stretch of Main Street between Horton Avenue and Cornwall Avenue, and also extending for a distance along Wallingford Road. It covers about , and is predominantly residential, with a significant concentration of houses built before 1850. Most of these are wood frame structures, either 1-1/2 or 2-1/2 stories in height, with gabled roofs. In addition to the First Congregational Church, there are two other churches in the district, as well as the 1867 town hall, an unusually late example of Greek Revival architecture. On South Main Street is a well-preserved late 18th-century commercial building.

He is today mostly remembered as the creator of Pudim Abade de Priscos, a classic of Portuguese cuisine. Biography Manuel Joaquim Machado Rebelo was born on 29 March 1834, in the civil parish of Santa Maria de Turiz, Vila Verde, the son of Manuel Jos√© Machado and Teresa Ang√©lica Rebelo, landowners and proprietors of the Quinta do Arco estate. He had two brothers, Lu√≠s Manuel Machado Rebelo, also a clergyman, and Francisco Jos√© Machado Rebelo, whose daughter Maria Am√©lia Machado Rebelo (d. 22 May 1954) lived with uncle Manuel Joaquim, and was devoted to him like a father. He studied Theology in the , in Braga, and, after being ordained, celebrated his first Mass on 27 January 1861. He was made a curate of , in Braga, on 3 March 1864, and the interim priest (') of Bastu√ßo, Barcelos, on 19 June of the same year. In 1868, he was made priest of Ruilhe, first in an interim capacity as a vig√°rio encomendado, then was collated in 1874. It was around this time, by decree of 13 May 1874, that Father Rebelo was made an honorary chaplain of the Royal Household. After nine years in Ruilhe, he was collated as parish priest of Priscos in 1883; he would remain in that position for the 47 years that followed. Parish Church of Priscos, Braga As a priest, he was deeply devoted to the Most Sacred Heart of Jesus, and a dedicated almoner. However, he soon became known for his natural artistic faculties: at the age of thirty, in 1864, he had a wooden theatre built in S√£o Miguel de Cunha and there directed several morality plays of his own composition, such as Taumaturgo Santo Ant√≥nio (\\"Saint Anthony the Thaumaturge\\"), and A Casta Suzana (\\"The Chaste Susanna\\"). He was also a passionate photographer, setting up his own darkroom; he had an interest in optics, owning a Zeiss lense that he attempted to adapt to a camera obscura of his own making, but that he never got round to build, and spoke with enthusiasm about the magic lantern ‚Äî speculating that, in the not-so-distant future, the projection of moving pictures would be \\"of paramount importance in the education of the people, and mainly children, on the mysteries of religion\\". He was also a gifted tailor and embroider. Most of his notoriety came, however, from his expertise in the culinary arts. He frequently received distinguished visitors in his residence; on the most important religious festivals, the Abbot would frequently entertain important parishioners, distinguished ladies and gentlemen, and prelates: it did not take long until he was known all over the country as one of the greatest Portuguese cooks of the 19th century. He was chosen to oversee sumptuous feasts in honour of eminent figures of aristocracy, politics, arts and letters. Adapting it to the standards of Portuguese cuisine, he was a follower of the French school in style and technique: his main influences, Car√™me, Plumerey, Urban Dubois, Gouff√©, Gustave Garlin, Gilbert Phil√©as, Montagn√©, Prosper Salles, and Auguste Escoffier. On 3 October 1887, King Lu√≠s and the Royal Family (Queen Maria Pia, Prince Royal Carlos, Princess Royal Amelia, Infante Afonso, Duke of Porto, and the infant Lu√≠s Filipe, Prince of Beira), accompanied by Prime Minister Jos√© Luciano de Castro and other senior members of the government, visited P√≥voa de Varzim. The local authorities invited the Abbot of Priscos to oversee the feast. After the meal, the King wanted to meet the Abbot and to thank him in person; reportedly, he inquired about the secret ingredient of a complicated dish, and was surprised to learn it was hay. This would not be the last dinner he would prepare to the Royal Family, however: one was especially rich in fanciful confectionary and decorative ornaments ‚Äî the pi√®ce de r√©sistance was an enormous chocolate beehive, topped with angel hair imitating a thatched roof, and filled with honeycomb-shaped puddings and sugar bees with translucent wings. Queen Maria Pia and Princess Royal Amelia stood up to admire the detail and were astonished to learn it was entirely edible. Abbot of Priscos pudding His most famous confection, however, was one of the few which recipe he actually publicised: the Pudim Abade de Priscos (Abbot of Priscos pudding). Mgr Manuel Pereira J√∫nior asked him to share a recipe to teach the schoolgirls at the primary school at the . By the 1910s, he was suffering from chronic hearing loss and had to resort to an ear trumpet; by 1917 he could no longer attend at the confessional.

The Royal Navy sold her in 1825 and she became the merchantman Toward Castle, and then a whaler. She was lost in 1838 off Baja California while well into her third whaling voyage. Royal Navy Captain John Tancock commissioned Conway on 1 October 1814 and in 1815 sailed her for the West Indies. On 26 June 1815 Panther, Gegollas, master, came into Plymouth. Conway, , , , and had detained Panther as Panther was sailing from Martinique to Dunkirk.Lloyd's List ‚Ññ4984. On 22 September 1816 Tancock left Conway to join . His replacement was Captain John Reynolds. Captain William Hill was promoted to post captain on 12 December 1816 and replaced Reynolds.Marshall (1830), Supple. Part 4, p.118. In 4 July 1817 Captain Edward Barnard replaced Hill, on the East Indies station. Conway was employed protecting British trade in the Persian Gulf and in suppressing the slave trade around √éle de France.Gentleman's Magazine (December 1863), pp.805-6. On 21 October 1819 Conway was at the Cape of Good Hope. A midshipman and four sailors drowned when their boat swamped while coming alongside Feniscowles, which had been driven ashore and wrecked at Green Point. All on board were rescued. She had been on a voyage from Bengal, India to Mauritius and Liverpool, Lancashire.\\"Ship News.\\" Times [London, England 22 December 1819: 4.

The Times Digital Archive. Web. 16 July 2018.] Conway arrived at Plymouth from the East India station in late December. She sailed on to Portsmouth where she was paid off on 20 January 1820. Between March and July 1820 Conway underwent refitting for sea duty. She was recommissioned in May under Captain Basil Hall, who sailed for South America on 10 August. She stopped at Tenerife, Rio de Janeiro, and the River Plate.Marshall (1830), Supple., Part 4, pp.164-184. On 20 August 1820 Conway sailed from England for the South American station and touched at Tenerife, Rio de Janeiro and the River Plate. Commodore Sir Thomas Hardy, conmmander-in- chief of the South America Station, then ordered Hall to sail to Valparaiso. Conway arrived at Valparaiso at Christmas. On 22 January 1821 , Captain Robert Cavendish Spencer, arrived at Valparaiso. Conway then sailed to Callao, arriving there on 31 January. At the time Lord Cochrane, commander of the insurgent Chilean Navy in the fight for Chile's independence form Spain, was blockading the Spanish-held ports. On 18 February, Captain Hall was at Lima visiting the Viceroy, General de la Serna, and his immediate predecessor, the deposed General Pezuela. In Hall's absence, when two officers from Conway came on shore at Callao, the Peruvian authorities arrested them on the suspicion that the officers were spies for Cochrane. Hall eventually succeeded in getting his officers released. Conway sailed from Callao on 23 February and on the 24th Hall met with Cochrane on Cochrane's flagship San Martin. Conway sailed on to Valparaiso on the 28th, arriving there on 18 March. She sailed on to Santiago for Hall to meet with Hardy, but then returned to Valparaiso where she remained between 5 April and 26 May. While she was there, her officers made surveys. They also observed a comet that remained in sight between 1 April and 8 June; the data they gathered helped Dr. Brinkley, of Dublin, compute its orbit and publish the results in 1822. On 26 May Conway sailed along the coast, stopping at Arica on 7 June and Ylo, both of which were almost uninhabited. Between 13 and 20 June Conway was at Mollendo. There Hall discovered that the locals used rafts made of inflated seal skins to cross a surf that would have overturned Conways boats. Conway returned to Callao on 24 June and on 25 June Hall met with General San Martin, who was aboard a schooner in Callao roads. On the 5 July the Spanish Viceroy announced that he would abandon Lima; San Martin entered Lima on 12 July and declared Peruvian independence on 28 July. Hall and Conway then visited Concepci√≥n and Arauco, Chile. Arauco had been the base for the pirate Vicente Benavides, who had recently fled, taking with him American and British sailors that he had captured when he captured their vessels.Benavides's men had captured, possibly amongst other vessels, in March 1821 and in May. Benavides was captured, hanged, and his body mutilated, in February 1822. Conway then returned to Valparaiso. On 14 November Conway left Valparaiso to visit ports between there and Lima to assist and protect British interests. she stopped at Coquimbo and Copiap√≥ where one of her midshipmen surveyed the harbour. She stayed at Callao from 9 to 17 December. She then sailed from Mocha Island north to San Blas, Nayarit. she arrived at San Blas on 28 March 1822, having stopped at Payta, Guayaquil, the Gal√°pagos Islands, Panama City, and Acapulco. On 26 April the merchants in San Blas received the authorization of the Mexican Government, conveyed via the state capital of Guadalajara, to send specie to England to pay for goods to be brought back to Mexico. On 6 May Conway took on board more than half a million dollars. Lloyd's List reported 27 September 1822 that a letter from San Blas had stated that Conway would sail for England on 1 June, carrying specie.Lloyd's List ‚Ññ5737. Conway sailed on 15 June. She then sailed nearly to Rio de Janeiro via Cape Horn. Conway arrived at Rio on 12 September. She arrived at England and was paid off at Chatham in the spring of 1823. =Disposal= Conway was laid up at Chatham in 1823. The \\"Principal Officers and Commissioners of His Majesty's Navy\\" first offered \\"Conway, of 26 guns and 452 tons\\", lying at Chatham, for sale on 27 January 1825. Apparently either she did not sell or the sale fell through and they offered her again on 13 October. Mr. Edward Cohen purchased her on that day for ¬£2,210. Toward Castle In 1826 Toward Castle appeared in Lloyd's Register and the Register of Shipping. Both showed her master as Jeffrey or Jeffrys, her owner as Smith, and her trade as London‚ÄìNew South Wales. However, Lloyd's showed her build year as 1808 and the Register as 1810. In much later volumes Lloyd's gave the build year as 1813. Lloyd's Register listed Toward Castle as sailing to New South Wales, having sailed on 17 August 1825.Lloyd's Register \\"Ships Trading to Van Diemen's Land and New South Wales\\". The Sydney Gazette and New South Wales Advertiser published the manifest of the \\"Cargo of the Ship Toward Castle, Robert Jeffery, Master, from London and Hobart Town, Van Diemen's Land, to Sydney, New South Wales\\".

Toward Castle was reported to have been at the Bay of Islands on 9 October, not yet having caught anything. On 25 September 1829 she was again there, with 200 tons of whale oil. In November she was at Tongatapu with 1,650 barrels. She returned to England on 14 July 1831 with 600 casks and 16 tanks of whale oil.British Southern Whale Fishery: Voyages ‚Äì Toward Castle. =Whaling voyage #2 (1828‚Äì1831)= Captain Brind sailed from England on 11 October 1831, again bound for New Zealand. Toward Castle sailed via the Cape of Good Hope and Tonga. On 4 March 1833 she was at the Bay of Islands with 1,500 barrels. She was reported at various times as being at Tonga or the Bay. On 17 November 1833 she was at Oahu. She returned to England via St Helena, arriving on 9 May 1835 with 2,300 barrels of oil. Fate Captain Thomas Emmens (or Emmett, or Howarth, or Bennett), sailed from England on 6 October 1835 on Toward Castles third whaling voyage. Toward Castle, Captain Emmett, was at Monterey, California, in November 1837. Toward Castle struck a shoal about north of Cedros Island off Baja California, on 7 January 1838. The crew took to the boats. Captain Emmens, his mate, and five men reached the mission at Todos los Santos, more than away. From there they went overland some 50 miles to La Paz. Dorotea carried them from there across the Gulf of California to Mazatl√°n. Samuel Talbot, the United States Consul at Mazatl√°n, arranged for two American crew members to be repatriated aboard the American schooner Boxer. Captain Emmens, his mate, and the other three crew members shipped aboard the English bark Vesper. As of 7 February there had been no news at Mazatl√°n of the fate of the remainder of Toward Castles 30 (or 31) man crew. Talbot thought that they had been lost.\\"Ship News.\\" Times [London, England 28 May 1838: 6. The Times Digital Archive.

He is best known as the coach of decathlon world record holder Ashton Eaton. After improving the world record twice and two world championship gold medals, Eaton closed off his career by becoming only the third man to defend the Olympic gold medal in the decathlon. Eaton is also the world record holder in the indoor Heptathlon and won three world championships. He also coached Brianne Theisen, Paul Terek, Sheldon Blockburger and four other 8,000 point decathletes; Brian Brophy, Paul Foxon, Bart Goodell and Chris Wilcox. Theisen won two world championship silver medals in the women's heptathlon, plus the Commonwealth Games and world indoor pentathlon gold medalist for Canada. Training partners under Marra, Eaton and Theisen were married in July 2013, officiated by Marra. Marra was a pole vaulter sprinter at Christian Brothers Academy in nearby Albany, New York. After receiving some helpful coaching tips there he learned Marra got his B.S. Degree at Mount Saint Mary's University and his master's degree from Syracuse University. He was an assistant coach at University of California, Santa Barbara, under Sam Adams before his first head coaching job at Springfield College. From 1981 to 1993, Marra coached at San Francisco State University, while simultaneously serving as a speed and fitness consultant for the San Francisco Giants. Marra was the American National Decathlon Coach from 1990-2000. When Eaton's original coach Dan Steele left, Vin Lananna first sought Marra's recommendations for a coach. Not liking the recommendations, Lananna offered Marra the job. He became a full- time assistant coach for multi-events at the University of Oregon, where he coached both Eaton and Theisen to NCAA championships in their respective events. Working for the Oregon Track Club he continued to coach them while also coaching the Oregon Ducks. Marra's technique involves breaking complex events into simple movements following scientific principles. As an example he cites Eaton's unique shuffle shot put technique originating from an act of frustration. At the end of 2016, after Eaton had won his second gold medal and Theisen had won bronze at the 2016 Olympics, Marra was given the IAAF award for Coaching Achievement. Following his accepting of the award, Marra was approached by several countries to assist in developing their athletic teams. He accepted the offer from Indonesia. In 2018, one of his new charges Lalu Muhammad Zohri won the world junior championships in the 100 meters. He continues to do coaching clinics around the U.S. Marra has been inducted into the Christian Brothers Academy, San Francisco State University, Pacific Association USATF and Mt.
