Cunard Line ownership She was sold by Thomson Line in 1911 to Cunard Line and renamed Albania, along with Ausonia and Ascania. These three ships were designed to sail on the Southampton - Halifax route and were also the first Cunard ocean liners to sail from Southampton. On 2 May 1911, the Albania pioneered Cunard's new route and on 16 May, she was followed by Ausonia and Ascania on 23 May. Albania became the first Cunard Line vessel to sail the St. Lawrence River to Montreal, which became a familiar destination for the company. When the St. Lawrence River was closed due to sea ice during the winter months, the western terminus of the route was changed to Portland, Maine. Within six months of her purchase, the Albania was determined to be a losing proposition for the company and she was listed for sale.

The appellation is bordered by two mountain ranges: the Mayacamas Mountains to the east and the Sonoma Mountains to the west.  History  Grapes growing in the Sonoma Valley AVA Sonoma Valley has played a significant role in the history of California wine. The first vineyards in the valley were planted by Franciscan friars at Mission San Francisco Solano in 1823. In 1857, Agoston Haraszthy established one of California's first successful commercial wineries here when he founded Buena Vista Winery. By 1920, there were 256 wineries in Sonoma Valley with more than planted to grape vines. Prohibition affected Sonoma Valley as hard as any other wine region in California, and most wineries were unable to continue operating. Recovery after the repeal of Prohibition in 1933 was slow. Even in 1969, there were only 58 bonded wineries in Sonoma Valley. The wine industry in the valley began to expand rapidly in the 1970s and 1980s. Official boundaries for the Sonoma Valley wine region were codified into federal law in 1981 as the eighth designated American Viticultural Area. By 2005, there were 254 wineries, and over under vine. The wine industry annually contributes over $8 billion USD to the local economy.  Climate and geography  The area is known for its unique terroir with Sonoma Mountain protecting the area from the wet and cool influence of the nearby Pacific Ocean. The Sonoma Mountains to the west help protect the valley from excessive rainfall. The cool air that does affect the region comes northward from San Pablo Bay through the Los Carneros region and southward from the Santa Rosa Plain.

Count Jind≈ôich Maty√°≈° Thurn-Valsassina (German: Heinrich Matthias Graf von Thurn und Valsassina; Italian: Enrico Matteo Conte della Torre di Valsassina) (24 February 1567 - 26 January 1640), was a Czech (Bohemian) nobleman, one of leaders of Protestant Bohemian Revolt against Emperor Ferdinand II. He took part in events that led to the Thirty Years War, and after the war he became a military leader and diplomat in Swedish service, who eventually resided in Swedish Estonia. Life He was the son of a member of the geheimrat of Ferdinand II, Archduke of Austria, Franz Napus von Thurn- Valsassina (Franti≈°ek Thurn), count of Linz (1508‚Äì1586) and his second wife, Countess Barbora Gr√§fin von Schlick (1547‚Äì1581), daughter of Hieronymus Schlick count of Bassano and Wei√ükirchen and countess Katharina von Gleichen- Tonna. (1754) Matrikel √∂fwer Swea rikes ridderskap och adel .. pp. 4-5 Both of his parents were Protestants. Count Jindrich Matyas was born on in Lipnice nad S√°zavou castle in the Crown of Bohemia. After the death of his father, he was fostered to his Catholic uncle John Ambrose. Young count Thurn served in the Imperial Habsburg embassy, and visited Istanbul, Syria, Egypt and Jerusalem. From 1592 he served in the imperial army against Turks. In imperial service, Thurn rose to the ranks of colonel and War Councillor. By marriage, he came into remarkable landholdings, in Croatian Krajina among other places. The Emperor granted him the burgraviate of Karl≈°tejn Castle in central Bohemia as reward for his accomplishments in the battles against the Turks in Hungary. In northeast Bohemia he purchased 1605 the lordship of Veli≈° manor (near town Jiƒç√≠n), which brought him to the membership of the Bohemian estate of nobles (p√°ni, \\"lords\\"). Politically, Thurn joined the Protestants of Bohemia where he served as marshal of the nobility. In 1617, the devout Catholic archduke Ferdinand of Styria was put forward as Habsburg successor to the aged, childless emperor Matthias, and also to be elected to the Bohemian throne. Bohemian nobles required him to commit to honor their freedom of religion, enshrined in the Decree (Letter of Majesty) of the late emperor Rudolph II. Thurn was one of signatories of Bohemians' critical reply to Ferdinand. =Leader of the Bohemian Rebellion= Despite his accession to the crown of Bohemia in 1617, Ferdinand was not willing to agree to the demands of the Bohemian nobility. Furthermore, their demands also failed to prevent Ferdinand's election as Holy Roman Emperor in 1619. What the nobles did achieve was that in 1618, in a stormy event at the Royal Castle of Prague, count Thurn was a key leader of that faction of the nobility who incited a crowd that defenestrated two of Ferdinand's representatives, Bo≈ôita of Martinice and Slavata of Chlum together with their scribe, Philip Fabricius. Following the defenestration, Thurn was elected as one of the thirty Defenders of the Protestant Faith elected by the Estates of Bohemia. The revolt of the Protestant population of Bohemia began on 23 May 1618 and Thurn took command of the national army. His command was signified by a series of ineffective campaigns, faults in the campaign plan in some cases beyond his control, which frustrated imperial efforts to quickly crush the revolt. He participated in deposing Ferdinand of Bohemia from the throne and in the election of Frederick V, Elector Palatine as the new Bohemian king. Count Thurn was commander of a regiment at the inauspicious Battle of White Mountain in 1620. After the Bohemians' defeat there, Ferdinand exiled him, like all the other Protestant nobility (including leaders of the uprising) and townspeople. Consequently, Thurn lost his estates in Bohemia. =In exile= After being exiled, Thurn continued to take part in the fighting and political negotiations of the Thirty Years' War against the Habsburgs, acting in the roles of both diplomat and as a soldier. In 1626 he took command of some troops in Silesia. Then he served as lieutenant general in the army of King Gustav Adolf of Sweden. His only son, count Frantisek Bernard, who rose to the rank of colonel in Swedish service, fell ill during the Polish campaign and died in 1628. On 11 October 1633 Thurn and his force of 8000 soldiers were confronted by Wallenstein's army near Steinau an der Oder in Saxony, where he was captured. He was ransomed soon from the captivity, and retired to the family's new holdings in P√§rnu (Pernau), Estonia. Count Thurn died there, and was buried in the St Mary's Cathedral of Tallinn. His heir was his underage grandson, count Heinrich von Thurn-Valsassina of P√§rnu (1628‚Äì1656), son of Franti≈°ek Bernard (1592‚Äì1628) and Magdalena von Thurn-Valsassina (born von Hardeck). Count Thurn wrote a booklet in German, titled Defensionsschrift (\\"Writing about Defenestration\\"), the work justifying his role in the events of 1618 as a deliberate, conscious defence of his religious beliefs. The booklet was published in Sweden.

It was intended from the start that the character had no back story at all so to give the player the ability to impose whatever back story or personality onto the character they desired. He is voiced by Rick Hunter, who returned for the sequel and its two expansion packs Apocalypse Weekend and Paradise Lost, which was released in 2005 and 2015 respectively and included some small redesigns of Postal Dude. Postal 2 was released in 2003 as a fully 3D first person shooter. The increased graphics capability allowed for Postal Dude to be presented in more detail. The final design for the character (visible in mirrors and some pre-rendered third-person sequences) was completed in 2001 by art director Josh Leichliter. Running with Scissors CEO Vince Desi describes the character as \\"like Clint Eastwood\\" in that he wants to mind his own business but people won't leave him alone. Unlike Postal, in which killing is necessary to complete a level, Postal Dude is not required to kill anyone to complete an errand in Postal 2. However, when trying to complete the errands of each day, he constantly faces opposition from several groups, including protesters, rednecks, terrorists, agents of law enforcement organizations, and a toy mascot resembling a giant scrotum named Krotchy. Desi indicated in an interview that the character's actions are completely up to the player. There is the option of nonviolence if the player chooses. Even though the Dude's age is never specified, design documents for Postal dating back to 1996 state that the character is 27 years old. Even though Rick Hunter voices the Dude in Postal, the voice is not meant to be that of the Dude - his grunts when getting hurt sound completely different to the ones used in Postal 2 and all the Hunter voice files are prefixed with \\"demon\\". It was revealed by Paradise Lost lead designer Marphy Black in 2015 that Vince Desi voiced the Dude's grunts and screams. Appearances =In video games= Very little is known about Postal Dude from Postal. The character \\"goes postal\\", and decides to kill everyone in the town for mostly unknown reasons (although the manual explains that the Postal Dude believes the town's populace to be stricken with a madness plague, and that it's up to him to stop it). Postal Dude has a diary which allows the player to know a bit about the character's paranoid psychosis. This diary is displayed between levels, and contains phrases such as \\"The earth is hungry. Its heart throbs and demands cleansing. The earth is also thirsty.\\" Postal Dude's character is much more developed in Postal 2. He has moved to the fictional town of Paradise, Arizona, after being hired by Running with Scissors, who also act as characters in the video game. Postal Dude lives in a trailer park with his wife (an unseen character identified only as \\"The Bitch\\"),Postalnation.net (Archived from the original on October 14, 2007.) and has a pet Pit bull named Champ, based on Desi's real pet Champ.Champ's Corner at Running with Scissors official website. It is Monday in the beginning of the video game, and Postal Dude's wife gives him a list of errands to complete, which include things like \\"Cash paycheck\\" or \\"Get milk\\". When Postal Dude goes to Running with Scissors to pick up a paycheck, he is fired by Vince Desi (who appears as himself in the video game) for unspecified reasons, so at the end of the day, Postal Dude's wife decides to give him more errands to complete for the rest of the week. On Tuesday, it is revealed that Postal Dude is a Methodist, since one of his errands is to \\"Confess sins\\" in the church. Tuesday and Wednesday also reveal that Postal Dude is active in politics: two errands involve getting signs for a petition \\"to make whiney congressmen play violent video games\\" and vote in the general election of Paradise. Postal Dude has a deceased father whom he hated, to the point that the first errand of Wednesday is to \\"piss on Dad\\". Apart from his wife and his deceased father, Postal Dude's only other known family member is his Uncle Dave, leader of a religious cult who is implied to be David Koresh. After completing the errands of each day, Postal Dude is seen returning to his trailer and is heard having short conversations with his wife about the events that took place while completing the errands. These conversations heavily suggest that their relation is a hostile one. On Friday, at the end of the game, Postal Dude's wife asks him if he remembered her Rocky Road ice cream, which she tells him not to forget on Monday. However, getting the Rocky Road is not a mission and there is no actual level to get it. The conversation is quickly ended with a gunshot, of which leaves a cliffhanger ending as to whether the Postal Dude has shot his wife, his wife has shot him, or he has shot himself. In Apocalypse Weekend, it is Saturday, and the Postal Dude wakes up in the hospital because of his gunshot wound, which is ambiguously revealed to have been caused by an \\"unfortunate firearms accident\\". In turn, this causes him from time to time to have hallucinations, seeing a distorted version of the world he is in, and fighting Gary Coleman-esque creatures. Postal Dude receives several \\"get well\\" cards: one is from his wife telling him she has left him, and the others tell him that his pet Champ is in the dog pound and that his trailer has been taken away. He is required to complete new, more complicated missions. Unlike the main game, the expansion actually requires Postal Dude to kill, varying from zombies to cows to elephants. Desi reappears as a character in the expansion, hiring Postal Dude again to obtain a gold disc from a rival publisher of Running with Scissors, and then to enter a terrorist training camp to retrieve a nuclear bomb to destroy the whole company. After completing these missions, Postal Dude goes to the dog pound to look for Champ, and after finding him, he proceeds to get out of Paradise, though not before confronting \\"Mike J, Kosher Mad Cow Zombie, God of Hellfire\\", a giant demon-like creature who serves as the final boss of the game. After defeating the boss, Postal Dude is seen driving his car with Champ, while Paradise is detonated by the nuclear bomb. The Postal Dude says \\"I regret nothing\\" as he leaves Paradise. Postal Dude returns as the main character in Postal III. He has moved to Paradise's sister city Catharsis. According to Running with Scissors' official website, Postal Dude is just \\"trying to save up for new tinfoil to put over his trailer windows.\\"POSTAL 3 Characters at Running with Scissors official website. Postal III will also let the player decide which way Postal Dude is going to follow: the \\"good\\" way by joining the Catharsis police force to protect the citizens, or the \\"bad\\" way and join the schemes of Mayor Chomo (portrayed by Ron Jeremy) and Uncle Dave.POSTAL 3 Story at Running with Scissors official website. In an interview, Steve Wik (Lead Design/Creative Director of Running with Scissors) and Andrew Belkin (Lead Producer of Akella) commented that Postal III would focus more on Postal Dude's personality, as well as his past and future actions, hence the idea of making Postal III a third-person shooter. Paradise Lost retconned Postal III by revealing that it was all an 11 year nightmare of a \\"dark future\\" after Postal Dude crashed his car escaping from Paradise immediately after the nuclear blast. In that time, Paradise has turned into a nuclear wasteland, and Champ mutated into a giant demon and was sealed in a place called the Hell Hole. Paradise Lost follows the Postal Dude's quest to free Champ and restore him to his dog form, encountering many familiar foes such as Mike J, The Bitch, and Gary Coleman. Paradise is depicted to have various factions seeking power in Paradise such as Running With Scissors, a cult of dwarves led by Gary Coleman, zombies, a gang led by Zack Ward, and al- Qaeda. The Postal Dude eventually finds Champ, and uses a serum to get him back to normal size, before fighting The Bitch, who has become monstrously large. Afterwards, The Postal Dude is given the choice to either overthrow all faction leaders and take control of Paradise for himself, or leave Paradise for the final time, where Paradise becomes engulfed in yet another nuclear explosion. =In film= Zack Ward portrays Postal Dude in Uwe Boll's film adaptation of the game. Ward described the character as somebody who just wanted to be liked and accepted. Ward said that he did not base his performance as Postal Dude on the video game renditions as he never played them, but on the script. Though the film has elements from both Postal and Postal 2, the character of Postal Dude was completely changed. In an interview with Gamasutra, Vince Desi commented that Ward as Postal Dude \\"has the look and he‚Äôs funny at the same time.\\" Postal Dude is mocked in a job interview, his local unemployment office kicks him out, and his wife cheats on him. He decides to get some money to leave Paradise, so he teams up with his Uncle Dave, who owes the government over a million dollars in taxes, to devise a plan to steal a shipment of 2000 Krotchy dolls, toys resembling a scrotum that seem to be really popular in Paradise, and to sell them for $4000 dollars apiece. When they arrive at the amusement park where the shipment is expected to arrive, Postal Dude and Uncle Dave's religious cult face opposition from Al Qaeda, who also want to steal the shipment for their own purposes. The two groups fight each other, resulting in the deaths of many innocent children, but the cult manages to get the shipment and Verne Troyer, the park's opening day guest. When they arrive to the cult's compound, they discover that the place has been invaded by terrorists, so they take shelter in the compound's bunker. Once there, Uncle Dave's right man hand Richard proceeds to initiate apocalypse per Uncle Dave's fictional bible, by throwing Verne Troyer to a group of chimpanzees to rape him, and then to kill Dave himself. After doing so, Richard imprisons Postal Dude in the bunker. After escaping from the compound, Postal Dude goes postal and begins a one-man war against his wife and her lovers, his uncle's murderer, the terrorists, the police, the angry townsfolk who want him dead, and the remains of the now-mad cult. He is joined by Faith, a young barista whom he has met before, and the two of them proceed to kill everyone except Osama bin Laden, who manages to escape with the help of a helicopter sent by his best friend George W. Bush. Postal Dude then prepares to leave the town along with Faith and Champ before it gets hit by 30 nuclear missiles unleashed by China in retaliation for Bush's declaration blaming China and India for the violence in Paradise. Reception Critics often comment on Postal Dude's aggressive personality. GameSpot's Mark East comments on the Postal Dude's phrases from his diary, which indicate \\"something's not quite right in Postal Dude's noggin\\". Michael L. House from Allgame describes Postal Dude as a \\"rampaging, murderous character.\\" Ivan Deez from IGN says that Postal Dude has a \\"sick mind\\", when referring to the source of some of the errands he has to complete. Macdonald and Rocha from Canada.com describe Postal Dude as a man whose \\"raison d'√™tre was to eliminate anyone - man, woman and child - with a dizzying arsenal of weapons\\", but at the same time as \\"a misunderstood and ostracized man who takes his revenge on the world with a killing spree.\\" =Controversy= In 2006 after the shooting in a college by Kimveer Gill in Canada, Postal Dude was singled out as a character Gill identified with. In Gill's blog he expressed admiration for Postal Dude, saying that \\"Postal dude was sad before he became angry and psychotic, that's the part we've never seen in the game. He was normal, but the world made him the way he became.\\" Postal¬≤ was singled out as one of Gill's favorite games.

He made his first on-screen appearance on 19 October 2007. Marco began a relationship with a pregnant Carmella Cammeniti, which caused tensions between himself and the baby's father, Oliver Barnes. Marco later asked Carmella to marry him and on the same day, he was injured in a bush fire. Marco died from his injuries shortly after and he departed on-screen on 2 July 2008. Character development Rosenfeld was cast in the role of Marco Silvani, an \\"Italian heartthrob\\". The character of Marco was brought in to \\"spice up Carmella's love life\\". A triangle develops between Carmella (Natalie Blair), Oliver Barnes (David Hoflin) and Marco because Carmella is pregnant with Oliver's child. Oliver becomes territorial over Carmella and he grows jealous of Marco. Rosenfeld said \\"Marco is withholding a secret that could bring into question his motives for dating Carmella.\\" Network Ten describe Marco as \\"handsome, charming, witty and intelligent\\". Despite his father being a traditional Italian, Marco is a \\"modern guy with an open mind\\". Marco is proud to be running his father's business, but he would rather be running his own restaurant. Ten also say that Marco has always wanted a family of his own and it has taken him a while to get over his failed marriage to Marissa. In February 2008, it was announced that Rosenfeld was to leave Neighbours that year, along with co-stars David Hoflin (Oliver Barnes), Daniel O'Connor (Ned Parker) and Sweeney Young (Riley Parker). It was speculated that the departures were linked to the arrival of Susan Bower, who was appointed executive producer at the end of 2007. Rosenfeld filmed his last scenes in April 2008. Marco's departure storyline centered on a bush fire. British magazine NOW reported that a picnic held by Carmella and Marco is at the centre of the action. Some residents manage to escape, while other have to take shelter. NOW added \\"The residents of Ramsay Street are forced to dig deep and find inner sources.\\" TV Tonight said that Marco would not survive the fire when he is left outside. Marco is treated by Karl Kennedy (Alan Fletcher), but he does not respond to the emergency treatment. Marco and Carmella then decide to get married, before he dies. David Knox called the situation \\"very soapie!\\" Storylines Marco is the only son of Franco Silvani (Gary Down). During his job as a local fruit and veg supplier, Marco sees a lot of Carmella Cammeniti. Marco and Carmella get talking and he finds out that she is pregnant and planning to take her fruit business online. Marco later helps Carmella out with some boxes and proposes that they become business partners. Carmella tells Marco that they just have a business partnership and Marco respects whatever she wants. Carmella suffers from stomach pains and is rushed to hospital. Marco finds himself stuck in the middle when Oliver Barnes arrives and Oliver asks Marco to leave. Marco returns with some flowers and says they are pink for a girl, which angers Oliver as he did not know the gender of the baby. Carmella accepts an offer from Marco to use his family's cottage for a few days. She and her sister have a look around and find photos of his wedding. Marco arrives with some supplies and Carmella confronts him. He tells her that he was married, but is now divorced. He then kisses Carmella. Marco goes behind Carmella's back to speak to the customers and when their website host goes bust, Marco is critical of her efforts to create another site. He then flirts with a new client, knowing that Carmella was watching. Marco arranges a cocktail party at his apartment and asks Carmella to co-host and invite all of their customers. The evening goes well and Marco and Carmella spend their first night together. Marco's mother, Patrizia (Lise Rodgers) and sister, Mia (Petra Yared) arrive at the apartment in the morning and are surprised to see Carmella. Marco tells his mother that he wants to be with Carmella. He also tells Mia that he is not getting back with his former wife. Carmella goes into premature labour and she had to have an emergency C-section. After the baby is born, Carmella breaks up with Marco. Marco accepts a job on a winery in Western Australia and is offered a year-long contract to stay. Carmella calls Marco and she begs him not to sign, so he comes home. Harold Bishop (Ian Smith) later rents the couple his house. Mia begins dating Oliver and Marco tells her that his marriage failed because he is infertile. Marco then tells Carmella, who stands by him. Oliver confronts Marco at baby Chloe's christening and a fight breaks out. Oliver then vows to fight for custody. Marco and Carmella buy the General Store, which angers his father as he wants Marco to continue the family business. Marco tells his father that he cannot have children and his father tells him that it may have been his fault. Marco later makes up with his father. During a picnic in the bush, Marco proposes to Carmella and she accepts. A bush fire breaks out and when Marco leaves the shelter to get milk for Chloe, he is caught up in the fire. Marco is taken to the hospital and he is told that he does not have long to live. He and Carmella decide to marry and Marco dies shortly after. Marco appears to Carmella as a vision before and during his funeral and tells her it is time for him to go before disappearing. Reception Rosenfeld was nominated for the Best Newcomer accolade at the 2008 Inside Soap Awards. Ruth Deller of Lowculture was negative towards Marco and Carmella and in July 2008, she wished they were leaving instead of Rosetta and Frazer. Of Marco's exit, Joe Julians of Digital Spy said, \\"Whilst not a particularly memorable character, Carmella's boyfriend Marco at least got a memorable death.\\" References External links * Character profile on the Official AU website Category:Neighbours characters Category:Television characters introduced in 2007 Category:Male characters in television ","title":"Marco Silvani"},{"id":"13610908","text":"Historical marker commemorating Nicholas Gustafson at the Christdala Evangelical Swedish Lutheran Church Nicholas Gustafson (August 20, 1846 - September 11, 1876) was a Swedish immigrant who was mortally wounded in the James‚ÄìYounger Gang bank raid in Northfield, Minnesota. Various sources use alternate spellings of his names including Nicolaus, Nicholaus or Niclas and Gustavson. The Northfield, Minnesota Robbery (Civil War St. Louis) He was born near Fiddekulla in the parish of Vissefj√§rda in Kalmar, Sweden. Nicholaus Gustafsson Viissefj√§rda (Anbytarforum) Bank raid Northfield; site of the robbery Gustafson was a recent immigrant to the United States. Swedish emigration records show that \\"Nicolaus Gustafson\\" arrived in Faribault, Minnesota on June 9, 1876.Emigranten Popul√§r, 1783-1951 Gustafson is known to have settled with his brother's family in the Millersburg, Minnesota area about 12 miles southwest of Northfield and 12 miles northwest of Faribault. At that time, the community was attracting a number of Swedish immigrants. It is the general consensus that, because of his recent arrival, he didn't speak enough English to understand what was going on during the raid on September 7, 1876. Consequently, when members of the James‚ÄìYounger Gang were yelling at local citizens to get off the street, he may not have understood them and was mortally wounded during the gun battle.The bank the Younger Gang attempted to rob in 1876 (First National Bank of Northfield) Cole Younger pleaded guilty to Gustafson's murder (perhaps, in part, to avoid Minnesota's mandated death sentence if he had been convicted of the crime), but claimed he wasn't the primary killer. He later stated \\"I have always believed that the man Nicholas Gustafson... was hit by a glancing shot from Manning's or Wheeler's rifle. If any of our party shot him, it must have been Woods.\\"The Story of Cole Younger, by Himself (by Cole Younger. Minnesota Historical Society Press. 2000) Gustafson died from his wound four days after the raid. John Olson of Northfield was the only eye witness of the Gustafson murder and testified against the Younger brothers. Olson was from Sweden and was working as a carpenter on a basement door at the corner of Fifth Street and Division (Bierman building). Olson's affidavit was instrumental in refuting Cole Younger's testimony and keeping the Younger brothers in the state penitentiary after repeated parole attempts. For twenty years he received death threats from ex-Confederates in Missouri for his testimony.[citation B. Wayne Quist, History of Christdala] Gustafson was buried in the Northfield Cemetery since the Millersburg Swedish-American community had no church or cemetery at that time. After his death, Millersburg Lutherans immediately started planning for the construction of Christdala Evangelical Swedish Lutheran Church. In 1877, John Olson was commissioned to build the Christdala Church.[citation B. Wayne Quist, History of Christdala] In 1948, Northfield citizens founded Defeat of Jesse James Days to honor the heroism of Northfield's townspeople. It has become one of the larger of such celebrations in Minnesota. Annually on the anniversary of the death of Nicolaus Gustafson and that of Joseph Lee Heywood, acting cashier at the First National Bank of Northfield, a graveside memorial service is conducted at Northfield Cemetery.[citation B.

He served on the Florida Territorial Council after Florida was acquired by the United States in 1821. Kingsley Plantation, which he owned and where he lived for 25 years, has been preserved as part of the Timucuan Ecological and Historic Preserve, run by the United States National Park Service. Kingsley was a relatively lenient slaveholder, who allowed his slaves the opportunity to be hired out and earn their freedom. He took four enslaved African women as common-law wives, practicing polygamy. His first wife, Anna Madgigine Jai Kingsley, was 13 years old when Kingsley purchased her in Havana. He said that he had married her, which he never said of his three other common-law wives. He emancipated Anna Jai when she turned 18, and trusted her with running his plantation when he was away on business. He had a total of nine mixed-race children with his wives. He educated his children to high standards and worked to ensure he could settle his estate on them and his wives. His interracial family and his business interests resulted in Kingsley being deeply invested in the Spanish system of slavery and society. As in the French colonies, certain rights were provided to a class of free people of color, and multiracial natural children were allowed to inherit property from white fathers. \\"In the Spanish Floridas free people of color ... enjoyed tremendously elevated status when compared to virtually any other person of African descent in North America.\\" Kingsley became involved in politics when control of the Florida colony passed in 1821 from Spain to the United States. He tried to persuade the new territorial government to maintain the special status of the population of free people of color, who were mostly multi- racial. He was unsuccessful in this effort, and in 1828 he published a pamphlet that defended a system of slavery that would allow slaves to purchase their freedom, and give rights to free blacks and free people of color. Faced with American laws that forbade interracial marriage, and discouraged \\"free people of color\\" (see Free black#Free negroes unwelcome) being allowed to stay or settle in the state, between 1835 and 1837, Kingsley relocated his large family to Haiti. (At that time it controlled part of what is today the Dominican Republic.) After his death, his estate in Florida was the subject of dispute between his widow Anna Jai and other members of Kingsley's family, but she was successful in gaining the estate he had bequeathed to her. Kingsley changed nationality repeatedly. Born British, he became American, then Spanish (Spanish Florida), then American again, then Danish (as a slave trader), and finally, a citizen of Haiti, although today that part of Haiti is in the Dominican Republic. Early life and education Kingsley was born in Bristol, England, the second of eight children, to Zephaniah Kingsley Sr., a Quaker from London, and Isabella Johnstone of Scotland.Fleszar, p. 9. The elder Kingsley moved his family to the Colony of South Carolina in 1770. His son grew up in Charleston, South Carolina, where the father became a successful merchant. At the age of 15 he was sent to London for his education; Zephaniah Kingsley Sr. purchased a rice plantation near Savannah, Georgia, and several other properties throughout the colonies and Caribbean islands. In total, he owned probably around 200 slaves in all, and thousands of acres of land.Fleszar, pp. 17‚Äì18. Like other British loyalists, Kingsley Sr. was forced to leave South Carolina with his family, and his properties and business were confiscated by the new government. He relocated to New Brunswick, Canada in 1782 following the American Revolutionary War, where the Crown provided him some land in compensation for his losses, and he again became a successful merchant.May, Philip S. (January 1945). \\"Zephaniah Kingsley, Nonconformist\\", The Florida Historical Quarterly 23 (3), pp. 145‚Äì159.Fleszar, p. 23. His son Zephaniah Kingsley Jr. returned to Charleston, South Carolina, in 1793, swore his allegiance to the United States, and began a career as a shipping merchant. His first ventures were in Saint-Domingue, during the Haitian Revolution, where coffee was his main interest as an export crop.Stowell, p. 2. He lived in Haiti for a brief period while the fledgling nation was working to create a society based on former slaves transitioning as free citizens. Kingsley traveled frequently, prompted by recurring political unrest among the Caribbean islands.Fleszar, pp. 35‚Äì39. The instability affected his business interests. Development of new cotton plantations in the Deep South in the United States, especially after Indian Removal, sharply increased the domestic demand for slaves. Kingsley began to travel to West Africa to procure Africans to be traded as slaves between America, Brazil, and the West Indies.Fleszar, pp. 40‚Äì44. In 1798 he became a Danish citizen, in the Danish West Indies.Schafer, p. 21. He continued to make his living trading slaves and shipping other goods into the 19th century, although the US prohibited the African slave trade in 1807, effective in 1808. Kingsley became a citizen of Spanish Florida in 1803, and many African slaves were smuggled into the U.S. through Florida. Laurel Grove Spain was offering land to settlers in order to populate Florida, so Kingsley petitioned the governor for land but was turned down. After waiting, he decided to purchase a farm for $5,300 ($ in 2009). It was named Laurel Grove, and its main entrance was a dock on Doctors Lake, south of where Orange Park is located today. Kingsley arrived with 10 slaves and began to cultivate the property immediately.Fleszar, p. 58. Another source stated he received a substantial land grant because he brought 74 slaves to Florida. The plantation grew oranges, sea island cotton, corn, potatoes, and peas. Kingsley's first slaves were brought from his family's plantation in South Carolina. By 1811, he had acquired a total of 100 slaves at Laurel Grove, obtained from Africa via Cuba, as Spain continued with the slave trade in its colonies.Stowell, p. 3. Kingsley trained the slaves at Laurel Grove in agricultural vocations to prepare them for future sale; he provided slave buyers with skilled artisans, which allowed him to charge 50 percent more than market price per slave. At Laurel Grove, slaves were trained in blacksmithing, carpentry, and cotton ginning, as well as field work.McTammany, Mary Jo (May 26, 1999). \\"Laurel Grove Was 'Real' Orange Park\\", Florida Times-Union (Jacksonville, FL), p. 4. Kingsley opposed allowing the slaves to participate in Christian religious worship. \\"All the late insurrections of slaves, he claimed, are to be traced to influential preachers of the gospel.\\" In 1806, Kingsley, called \\"one of Florida's most flamboyent slaveholders\\", took a trip to Cuba, where he purchased Anna Madgigine Jai (born as Anta Majigeen Ndiaye), a 13-year-old Wolof girl from what is now Senegal. He married her in an African ceremony in Havana soon after purchasing her.Mallard, Kiley (Winter 2007). \\"The Kingsley Plantation: Slavery in Spanish Florida\\" , Florida History and the Arts, pp. 1‚Äì7. The union was not legally recognized by Spanish Florida or the United States during their lives.Fleszar, p. 68. Kingsley returned with Anna to Laurel Grove and gradually depended on her to run the plantation in his absence.Schafer, p. 34.Mark Fleszar writes that interpretation of how much Anna managed Laurel Grove \\"deserves caution\\", as Kingsley's letters indicate white overseers were responsible for the day- to-day issues of the plantation when he was away on business. Kingsley told abolitionist Lydia Child in an interview that Anna \\"was very capable, and could carry on all the affairs of the plantation in my absence, as well as I could myself.\\" He either deliberately misrepresented other details in his life or Child's reporting was inaccurate, calling into question other statements Kingsley was reported to have made. (Fleszar, p. 72.) In 1811, Kingsley petitioned the colonial Spanish government to free Anna and their three mixed- race children, and the request was granted. The Laurel Grove plantation during one year earned $10,000 ($ in 2009), which was an extraordinary amount for Florida. With his earnings, Kingsley purchased several locations on the opposite side of the St. Johns River, including St. Johns Bluff, San Jose, and Beauclerc in what is now Jacksonville, and Drayton Island farther south near Lake George. After gaining freedom, Anna Kingsley was awarded five acres in a land grant by the Spanish government. She purchased slaves to help farm it.\\"Anna Kingsley: A Free Woman\\", Timucuan Ecological and Historical Park, National Park Service, accessed May 14, 2010.Fleszar, p. 76. Zephaniah Kingsley became involved in the shipping industry, including the coastwise trade, related to his large-scale domestic slave trading, which continued in the US after the Atlantic trade was prohibited. While at Laurel Grove, Kingsley was attempting to smuggle in 350 slaves (the international slave trade was abolished in 1807) when the ship was captured by the U.S. Coast Guard. Not knowing what to do with so many indigent people, the Coast Guard turned them over to Kingsley, who was the only person in the area who could care for such a number. During an insurgency that became known as the Patriot Rebellion, in an attempt to annex Florida to the United States, American forces, American-supplied Creek, and renegades from Georgia crossed the border into the Spanish colony and began raiding the few settlements in northeast Florida. They enslaved the black people they captured. In 1813, the Americans captured Kingsley and forced him to sign an endorsement of the rebellion.John McIntosh, owner of the Fort George Plantation before Kingsley, accused him in 1826 of financially supporting the war. The accusation was likely politically motivated, as Kingsley suddenly resigned his position on the Territorial Council, and McIntosh was angry about the public treatment he had received since the war for his role in it. (Fleszar, p. 135.) The insurgents occupied Laurel Grove, using it as a base to raid other plantations and nearby towns. Kingsley left the area. After assuring her safety with the Spanish forces, Anna Jai burned the plantation down so the rebels could not use it; she took her children and a dozen slaves aboard a Spanish gunboat to escape the conflict.Schafer, pp. 37‚Äì42. For her loyalty, Anna Jai was rewarded with a grant of from the Spanish colonial government. Fort George Island The kitchen (left) and main house (right) on Fort George Island. Anna Madgigine Jai lived separately with her children in the kitchen house, a practice common among Wolof women. Maam Anna's apartments, now restored by the National Park Service, were above the kitchens. In 1814, Kingsley and Anna moved to a plantation on Fort George Island at the mouth of the St. Johns River; they lived there for 25 years. Anna and Kingsley's fourth and last child was born on Fort George Island in 1824. Kingsley took three younger enslaved women as common-law wives (or concubines) and fathered children with at least two of them, totaling nine children in all.Fleszar, p. 139. He eventually freed each of the slave women: they were named Flora Kingsley, Sarah Kingsley, who brought her son Micanopy; and Munsilna McGundo, who brought her daughter Fatima. The Kingsley family was, according to historian Daniel Stowell, \\"complex at best\\".Stowell, p. 4. In his will, the only woman Kingsley named as his wife was Anna. Primary documentation by Kingsley is scarce, but historians consider Flora, Sarah, and Munsila as \\"lesser wives\\", or \\"co-wives\\" with Anna.Schafer, p. 56. Stowell suggests \\"concubines\\" is a more accurate description of their status. Kingsley lavished all his children with affection, attention, and luxury. They were educated with the best European teaching he could afford.Fleszar, p. 133. When he entertained visitors at his Fort George plantation, Anna sat \\"at the head of the table\\"; they were \\"surrounded by healthy and handsome children\\" in a parlor decorated with portraits of African women.Stowell, p. 108. The plantation featured a main house and a two-story structure called the \\"Ma'am Anna House\\". It had a kitchen on the ground floor and living quarters on the second. Anna lived there with her children, as was the custom among the Wolof people. The plantation produced oranges, sea island long-staple cotton, indigo, okra, and other vegetables. Approximately 60 slaves were managed under the task system: each slave had a quota of work to do per day. When they were finished, they were allowed to do what they wished.Labor, Timucuan Ecological and Historic Preserve, National Park Service (July 6, 2006). Retrieved on July 10, 2009. Some slaves had personal gardens which they were allowed to cultivate, and from which they sold vegetables. Thirty-two cabins were constructed for and by the slaves, made from tabby, which made them durable, insulated, and inexpensive, although labor-intensive. The cabins were located about a quarter of a mile (400 m) from the main house. Slaves were allowed to padlock their cabins and build porches that faced away from the main house. Both of these features were unusual for slave quarters in the antebellum South.Davidson, James M.; Roberts, Erika, and Rooney, Clete \\"Preliminary Results of the 2006 University of Florida Archaeological Field School Excavations at Kingsley Plantation, Fort George Island, Florida\\", African Diaspora Archeology Network. Retrieved on July 10, 2009. Kingsley was a lenient slave owner: \\"A patriarchal feeling of affection is due to every slave from his owner, who should consider the slave as a member of his family.\\" Restrictions under a new government Following the transfer of Florida from Spain to the United States in 1821, Florida's Territorial Council began to establish an American government. The Council focused primarily on allowing immigrants to Florida access to the ceded by Spain, and removing the Seminole to Indian Territory in keeping with the extinguishing of Indian land claims in other parts of the Southeast in this period.Gannon, p. 215. Americans settled in the central portion of north Florida and built productive plantations worked by slaves. The Americans imposed the binary racial caste system that they had developed throughout the Southeastern U.S. This system contrasted with the standing practice in which Kingsley was invested, which, based on Spanish law as implemented in Florida, supported three social tiers: whites, free people of color, and slaves. The Spanish government recognized interracial marriages and allowed mixed-race children to inherit property. Territorial Governor William P. Duval recommended to President Monroe in 1822 that Kingsley be appointed to the new Council, but Monroe did not appoint him until the following year. He was also recommended by Joseph Marion Hernandez, Florida's nonvoting delegate to Congress before the territory was admitted as a state. On June 2, Kingsley was appointed to a three-person committee \\"to consider the duties of masters of slaves and the duties of slaves and free persons of color, and the regulations necessary for their government\\". On June 19 Kingsley reported that the committee could not agree and asked that it be discharged. Kingsley's position was that Florida should be receptive, like Spain, to free people of color, that they should have some rights, even though less than those of whites. As he stated in a published Address to the Council, \\"I consider that our personal safety as well as the permanent condition of our Slave property is intimately connected with and depends much on our good policy in making it the interest of our free colored population to be attached to good order and have a friendly feeling towards the white population.\\" When it became apparent to Kingsley that the Council would not agree to rights for free blacks and mixed- race people, he resigned his position.Fleszar, pp. 134‚Äì135. In 1824 he was no longer a member. Through the 1820s the council began to enact strict laws separating the races, and Kingsley became worried about his future and the rights of his family. (Like other Southern states, Florida by 1860 abhorred free blacks as a threat to slavery, made their lives difficult, and encouraged them to leave the state.) Kingley's Treatise To address these issues, in 1828 Kingsley published a pamphlet, titled A Treatise on the Patriarchal or Co-operative System of Society as it Exists in some Governments and Colonies in America, and in the United States, under the Name of Slavery, with its Necessity and Advantages. The first edition was published without his name, signed simply \\"An inhabitant of Florida\\". His name was added in the 2nd edition, with the note that he is a \\"slave owner\\", who has lived \\"by planting in Florida for the last twenty-five years, disavow[ing] all other motives but that of increasing the value of his property.\\" The pamphlet had a second edition in 1829 and was reprinted again in 1833 and 1834, showing significant readership. In it, he wrote: > Slavery is a necessary state of control from which no condition of society > can be perfectly free. The term is applicable to and fits all grades and > conditions in almost every point of view, whether moral, physical, or > political. Kingsley asserted that when slavery is associated with cruelty it is an abomination; when it is joined with benevolence and justice, it \\"easily amalgamates with the ordinary conditions of life\\".Fleszar, p. 148. He wrote that Africans were better suited than Europeans for labor in hot climates (a shared stereotype), and that their happiness was maximized when they were rigidly controlled; their contentment was greater than whites of a similar class. He asserted that people of mixed race were healthier and more beautiful than either Africans or Europeans, and considered his mixed-race children a barrier to an impending race war.Brown, Cantor (January 1995). \\"Race Relations in Territorial Florida\\", The Florida Historical Quarterly, pp. 287‚Äì307. Although his pamphlet was published four times, reception to it was mixed. While some Southerners used it to defend the institution of slavery, others believed that Kingsley's support of a free class of blacks was a prelude to abolition of slavery.Fleszar, pp. 148‚Äì149. Abolitionists considered Kingsley's arguments for slavery weak and wrote that logically, the planter should conclude that slavery must be eradicated. Lydia Child, a New York-based abolitionist, included Kingsley in 1836 on a list of people perpetuating the \\"evils of slavery\\".Fleszar, pp. 154‚Äì156. Although Kingsley was wealthy, learned, and powerful, the treatise is believed to have contributed to the decline of his reputation in Florida. He became embroiled in a political scandal with Florida's first governor, William DuVal. The governor was quoted in newspapers making scathingly critical remarks about Kingsley's motives and his mixed-race family after the planter petitioned to have DuVal removed from his office for corruption.Fleszar, pp. 150‚Äì152. Haiti Mayorasgo de Koka, as drawn by Kingsley After trying to persuade the new government of Florida to provide for rights for free people of color, including the right of mixed-race children to inherit property from their fathers, Kingsley began to think that the independent republic of Haiti was more conducive to what he wanted to achieve. Haiti's government was actively recruiting free blacks from across the Americas to settle the island, offering them land and citizenship.Stowell, p. 19. Kingsley highlighted its successes as a nation of free blacks in his treatise, writing > ... under a just and prudent system of management, negroes are safe, > permanent, productive and growing property, and easily governed; that they > are not naturally desirous of changes, but are sober, discreet, honest and > obliging, are less troublesome, and possess a much better moral character > than the ordinary class of corrupted whites of a similar condition.Kingsley, > pp. 6‚Äì7. Kingsley's praise of Haiti's new system‚Äîwhich outlawed slavery‚Äîcombined with his defense of slavery, is notable to historian Mark Fleszar. He says that the paradox in Kingsley's thinking indicated a \\"disordered worldview\\".Fleszar, p. 157. Kingsley was determined to create the society he had written about and defended. Kingsley's son George and six of his slaves traveled to Haiti to scout for land, finding a suitable location on the northeastern shore of the island, in what is today the Puerto Plata Province of the Dominican Republic. By 1835 Kingsley realized that his marriage to Anna would not be recognized in the United States, and, in the event of his death, holdings in the name of Anna, Flora, Sarah, McGundo, and their mixed-race children might be confiscated. Over the next two years, Kingsley relocated to Haiti with most of his extensive family. Two of his daughters stayed in Florida, as they had married local white planters. The others went with him to a plantation named Mayorasgo de Koka, which was worked by more than 50 slaves transplanted from the Fort George Island plantation. In Haiti, the workers were contracted to work as indentured servants, who would earn full freedom after nine years of labor.Stowell, p. 20. Death and property disputes After visiting his family in Haiti in 1843, Kingsley boarded a ship going to New York City to conduct business there. His death of pulmonary disease at 78 years old was recorded in New York City, where Kingsley was buried in a Quaker cemetery. He left much of his land to his wives and children, a bequest which was immediately contested on racial grounds by his white relatives. Kingsley's niece, Anna McNeill (who married George Whistler; their son James Whistler became a noted artist) was among the family members who tried to have all of Kingsley's family of African descent excluded from his will. Kingsley's will stipulated that no remaining slaves should be separated from their families, and that they should be given the opportunity to purchase their freedom at half their market price. Anna Madgigine Jai, who kept her African name through the marriage, returned to Florida in 1846 to oppose Kingsley's white relatives in court in Duval County. Arguing her case within the dictates of the Adams‚ÄìOn√≠s Treaty, she was successful; it was an extraordinary achievement in light of the state and local policy that was hostile toward freed slaves or blacks of any status.Schafer, p. 72. After a brief period in Florida during the U.S. Civil War (1861‚Äì1865), Anna Jai fled to New York, as she supported the Union. After the war, she returned to Florida. Anna Madgigine Jai died in April or May 1870 on a farm in the Arlington neighborhood of Jacksonville. She was buried there in an unmarked grave. Post-Civil War The Fort George plantation was sold soon after Kingsley's death. After the Civil War, the Freedmen's Bureau controlled the island until 1869, when it was purchased by another planter. The island changed hands under private ownership until 1955, when it was acquired by the Florida Park Service. Kingsley's house, \\"the oldest standing plantation house in Florida\\",\\"Archaeology Field School\\", Timucuan Ecological and Historic Preserve, National Park Service, accessed May 15, 2010. Ma'am Anna House, and the barn survived the years relatively intact. Most of the slave quarters did as well. The National Park Service established the Timucuan Ecological and Historic Preserve in 1988 and acquired of land surrounding the Kingsley Plantation buildings in 1991.Stowell and Tilford, pp. 17‚Äì21.

To develop his lungs, the facility had Henry blow up balloons. In the 1930s Henry became a vaudeville magician. While preparing for a show in 1938 or 1939, Joseph writes, \\"he came back to the car to get the rest of his magic tricks only to find the vehicle had been broken into and everything was gone.\\" With his magic tricks stolen, Maar went on stage and performed a show consisting primarily of balloon twisting. \\"Afterward, the agents went nuts and told him to forget the magic and to start doing the balloons.

That would represent a single lineage of owls adapting to the largest size of their prey on the island, such as the great erinaceomorph of Gargano, Deinogalerix, and rodents.Ml√≠kovsk√Ω, J. (1998).

Simmons was born in Moseley, Birmingham. Following elementary education, he became a Primitive Methodist lay preacher at the age of 16. In World War I he served in the Worcestershire Regiment, seeing action in France, Egypt and Gallipoli. He was twice imprisoned whilst in the army, for appearing in uniform at a peace rally and for protesting against field punishments. He lost his leg at the Battle of Vimy Ridge. Following the war, he was a leading member of NUX the National Union of Ex-Servicemen, which fought for the rights of those returning from the war. His more militant stance, but reformist not revolutionary, was weakened as many of his comrades left to join the newly formed Communist Party. The NUX was later to effectively disappear as it played an important role in the foundation of the British Legion. Simmons remained active for ex-Servicemen in local organisations. Jim Simmons also played a leading role in the Labour Churches movement. He gained political office as a member of Birmingham City Council from 1921‚Äì1931 and 1942‚Äì1945. Member of parliament for Erdington Simmons was selected as the Labour Party's candidate to contest Birmingham Erdington at the 1924 general election. He failed to unseat the sitting Conservative MP, Sir Arthur Steel- Maitland in a straight fight. At the next general election in 1929, he was again Labour candidate at Erdington. As well as Steel-Maitland, a Liberal, H J H Dyer, was also nominated to contest the seat. Simmons defeated Steel- Maitland by the narrow margin of 133 votes, benefitting from the fact that Dyer received more than 6,300 votes. The election had been very bitter, with Simmons issuing a leaflet accusing Steel-Maitland of abusing his position as Minister for Labour and using a charitable fund to subsidise colliery owners to employ miners at less than the minimum wage. Following a threat by the defeated MP to begin libel proceedings, Simmons issued a formal apology. Two years later another general election was called. Simmons defended his seat against a new Conservative opponent J F Eales. There was a large swing against Labour, and Eales defeated Simmons by the majority of nearly 19,000 votes. At the next general election in 1935 Simmons attempted to regain the Erdington seat from Eales. This time it was a three-cornered contest, with an independent candidate also standing. He failed to be elected, increasingly his vote only marginally. On the death of Eales, Simmons also unsuccessfully contested the 1936 by-election, which was to be the last contest until 1945, owing to the Second World War. Simmons found work as a political journalist, editing the Town Crier, the journal of the Birmingham Trades Council from 1940‚Äì1945. Member of parliament for Birmingham West Simmons was nominated as Labour candidate for Birmingham West at the 1945 general election, in opposition to the sitting Conservative MP Walter Higgs. There was a landslide to Labour, and he won the seat comfortably. He was a member of the Labour Government 1945-1951 as a Lord of the Treasury from 30 March 1946 to 1 February 1949, after which he served as Parliamentary Secretary to the Minister for Pensions. Member of parliament for Brierley Hill Following boundary changes, Simmons became MP for the new Black Country constituency of Brierley Hill from the 1950 general election. He held the seat at the 1955 election, but was unexpectedly defeated by his Conservative opponent at the 1959 general election. Simmons was a strong advocate of the Temperance movement, and campaigned for fourteen-year-old children to be banned from the bars of clubs. His defeat in 1959 was believed to have been partly attributable to the opposition of brewery interests. He wrote his autobiography Soapbox Evangelist in 1971. He died in 1975, survived by his four sons and second wife.

In January 1997, he felled Kiidk'yaas (also known as \\"the Golden Spruce\\"), a Sitka Spruce tree located on the Haida Gwaii archipelago and considered sacred by the Haida people. Hadwin stated that he cut the tree down as a protest against the logging industry. While facing criminal charges for the act, he disappeared en route to his trial. His fate remains unknown. Hadwin is the subject of John Vaillant's 2004 book The Golden Spruce and Sasha Snow's 2015 documentary film Hadwin's Judgement.\\"Film Review: Hadwin‚Äôs Judgement\\". Hakai Magazine, September 21, 2015. The film includes reenactments in which Hadwin is portrayed by actor Doug Chapman. Early life Hadwin was born in West Vancouver, British Columbia. His family was active in the logging industry. Hadwin himself became a logger and later a forest engineer. However, he became increasingly upset with the logging industry's methods and impacts, and exhibited signs of mental instability. Cutting Down of Kiidk'yaas In January 1997, Hadwin traveled to Haida Gwaii and purchased a chainsaw and other felling equipment. Early on the morning of January 20, 1997, he swam across the freezing Yakoun River with all of his equipment and made a series of strategic deep cuts in Kiidk'yaas (the Golden Spruce). The cuts were designed to leave Kiidk'yaas standing but weakened, so that it would be knocked over by the next strong winds. The tree fell two days later. After cutting down the tree, Hadwin left the islands for Prince Rupert, British Columbia. He sent a fax to the media and the Haida nation claiming responsibility for the act, saying that he was motivated by \\"rage and hatred towards university trained professionals and their extremist supporters\\".Vaillant, p. 135 The act outraged people throughout Canada and received extensive media coverage. Hadwin was arrested, ordered to return to Haida Gwaii to stand trial, and released on bail. Disappearance Hadwin's court appearance was scheduled for February 18, 1997, in Masset. Numerous people speculated that Hadwin would be killed before he could stand trial.Vaillant, p. 163 Hadwin stated that he feared for his safety if he were to travel from Prince Rupert to Masset by ferry or plane, and decided to make the trip across the Hecate Strait (a notoriously stormy and violent body of water) alone by kayak. On February 11, Hadwin set out from Prince Rupert, but turned back a day later after being caught in a storm. On February 13, Hadwin set out again. The next day he was spotted north of Prince Rupert, but he failed to appear in court as scheduled. There have been no confirmed sightings of Hadwin ever since. In June 1997, the wreckage of Hadwin's kayak and equipment was found on uninhabited Mary Island, an island about 4 miles long located northwest of Prince Rupert at the entrance to Revillagigedo Channel. Because Hadwin was known to be an expert in wilderness survival and said to have an exceptional tolerance for the cold,Vaillant, p. 209 some people believe that Hadwin faked his own death and vanished into the wilderness. His ultimate fate is unknown.

It lived at what is now Monte Gargano in Italy, and was an island throughout much of the Neogene when sea levels were higher. The owl's remains date back to the Miocene-Pliocene boundary 5.5 to 5 million years ago. The fossil bones are about 60% as long again as a modern barn owl, giving a total length of about 50‚Äì65 cm for T. robusta. This owl provides an interesting case study of evolution and insular gigantism. Evolution, taxonomy and systematics It was found sympatrically with the gigantic relative, Tyto gigantea, which at some 220% of the size of the barn owl grew to some 70‚Äì85 cm in length‚Äîlarger than a Eurasian eagle-owl and maybe up to twice as heavy.Ballmann (1973b) Like other apex predators they can be presumed to have occurred at low population densities. Being apparently endemic to Gargano Island and perhaps some other islands in today's Apennines, where one or two huge eagles and at least at times a normal-sized barn-owl also occurred (though no large mammalian carnivores), these owls raise the question how minimum viable populations could be maintained long enough for them to live and prosper. It is extremely commonplace for larger predatory birds such as Falconiformes and Strigiformes to evolve differently-sized sexes. Namely, the females being considerably larger with little or no overlap in size between sexes. This allows them to hunt for different-sized prey, allowing a larger, more resilient population to live off a land. But this was apparently not the case here, as there is a reasonably large sample of bones of each of the 3 owl taxa to display the natural and sexual variation within each. In the oldest fossil samples, no giant owls were found to accompany them, whereas the latest seemed to a range of owls attributed to all 3 species. The small owls supposedly were replaced by or evolved into T. robusta from some point onwards, and T. gigantea appeared later, supposedly alongside it as well as a recolonization by Continental European stock. That this was by no means a very parsimonious assumption was already noted in the original descriptions of the remains assigned to T. robusta: > \\"If one assumes that the large barn-owls on Gargano would have arisen from > multiple colonizations [...], T. robusta would have to be separated into two > distinct species. The medium-sized form of the first colonist cannot be the > same as the middle-sized form of the second colonist. As there are no > morphological findings to support this assumption, it was refrained from > separating [the T. robusta material into] two species. In how far one can > actually expect morphological differences in forms so closely related is > debatable.\\"\\"Nimmt man an da√ü die gro√üen Schleieereulen auf Gargano durch > Mehrfachbesiedlung entstanden (vgl. S.48), so w√§re Tyto robusta in zwei > verschiedene Arten zu unterteilen. Die mittelgro√üe Form des Erstbesiedlers > kann nicht mit der mittelgro√üen Form des Zweitbesiedlers identisch sein. Da > f√ºr diese Annahme keine morphologischen Befunde vorliegen, wurde die > Auftrennung in zwei Arten nicht durchgef√ºhrt. Wie weit bei derart eng > verwandten Formen mit morphologischen Unterschieden √ºberhaupt gerechnet > werden kann, sei dahingestellt.\\" > (Ballmann 1973a: p. 35) More recently, it was noted that the smaller barn-owl of Gargano was not Tyto sanctialbani, which inhabited Europe north of the Alps in the latter Miocene, but its Mediterranean relative Tyto balearica, which was a sister species or chronospecies of or a southward divergence from T. sanctialbani and decidedly more robust. In addition, it appeared as if the Tyto of the youngest samples fell into 2, not 3 size groups. Presumably, the island was initially colonized by T. balearica whose core range eventually extended from the Apennines westwards to Iberia; they might have become cut off from the main population when the Mediterranean reflooded at the end of the Messinian salinity crisis 6 million years ago. The entire population evolved into larger T. robusta, which were still close enough in size to exclude T. balearica from maintaining a constant presence alongside the larger owls. By and by, much of the fauna of Gargano Island, in a dramatic case of evolution according to Cope's Rule, became larger and larger; the barn-owls were not an exception as there was larger and larger prey accessible only to large individuals of each successive generation. According to the revised theory, T. robusta had entirely evolved into T. gigantea eventually, and the prey preferences of these were so that the plentiful smaller mammals were again less intensely preyed upon, permitting a resident population of the now well-distinct T. balearica to recolonize Gargano Island. The remains initially presumed to be \\"late\\" T. robusta would actually be large T. balearica. Jir√≠ Ml√≠kovsk√Ω who proposed this solution does not use paleosubspecies in his taxonomic treatments and synonymized T. robusta with T. gigantea.Ml√≠kovsk√Ω (2002) But the former was actually described a few pages before the latter in the same work,Ballmann (1973a,b) and thus the synonymy would be the other way around. In any case, if these owls are considered paleosubspecies, the largest and latest form would be called Tyto robusta gigantea. However, with more material having become available in the last few years, it is possible to better determine which individual bone belonged to what owl taxon, and it seems as if the giant barn- owls may indeed be separable as distinct species; the possibility of only a single large to huge population with marked sexual dimorphism existing at any one time cannot be fully excluded though. Identification of the small barn owl species as T. balearica and not T. sanctialbani was confirmed on the other hand.Pavia & G√∂hlich (2005) Ecology The fossil owl bones are of Gargano are found in terra rossa (red earth) paleokarst infills. As the global climate moved towards the start of the last ice age period, it was not too dissimilar from today, albeit a bit warmer and more humid. Conditions must have been more extreme in the Mediterranean basin though, as the region had been drastically affected by the Messinian Salinity Crisis. In any case, the Gargano giant barn-owls must have lived in habitat not too different from that of the Caribbean giant barn-owls of the Quaternary: semihumid to semiarid‚Äîperhaps seasonally arid‚Äîopen country tending to karstic, and vegetated mainly with shrubs and small trees, perhaps dotted with copses of larger trees. The owls would probably have sought sheltered places to roost during the day, but for nesting barn-owls prefer crevices or hollows, and those of sufficient size would probably have been more plentiful in the broken ground than in the smallish trees of the region. Like some barn-owls today, the huge forms of Gargano Island might thus have been ground-nesters. These owls would have ruled Gargano's nightly skies; at daytime the no less impressive Garganoaetus eagles took over. As the larger land animals of Gargano Island are impressively well-known, it is possible to give a quite comprehensive list of the animals the giant owls ate even in the absence of fossil owl pellets providing direct evidence. Available prey included: * Deinogalerix‚Äî\\"hairy hedgehogs\\" that ranged from weasel- to dog-sized. The giant D. koenigswaldi with a skull of c.20 cm length could still have been preyed upon by the largest barn-owl females, though probably not on a regular basis as being the terrestrial apex predator it was a fierce animalFreudenthal (1972) and not easily subdued. * Smaller species of the Hoplitomeryx‚Äî\\"prongdeer\\", five-horned sabre-toothed even-toed ungulates. Barn-owls generally do not feed on carrion, their beak and head shapes being ill-suited for tearing apart prey too large to manipulate with their feet also.Bruce (1999) Thus the red deer-sized largest Hoplitomeryx do not seem to have been part of the giant owls' prey. * Paralutra garganensis‚Äîa species of otter endemic to Gargano Island. * Prolagus imperialis and P. apricenicus‚Äîhuge pikas endemic to Gagano Island. * Stertomys laticrestatus‚Äîa dormouse of large size. Apparently a monotypic genus. * Hattomys‚Äî3 species of giant hamster, at least some of which probably also occurred elsewhere. In addition, the smaller rodents (Mikrotia spp. and Apodemus gorafensis mice and a Cricetus hamster) might have been taken on occasion (or preferably by T. robusta, whatever its taxonomic and systematic status). It is unlikely that ponderous owls on an island abundant in mammalian prey would evolve good bird-hunting skills, but theoretically the local pigeons (Columba omnisanctorum or C. pisana) as well as the smaller Tyto balearica might have been possible prey also.

Performance and publication Swetnam the Woman-Hater was first published in 1620, in a quarto issued by Richard Meighen. The title page of the quarto states that the play was performed by Queen Anne's Men at the Red Bull Theatre; the most likely date for the first performance is considered to have been in late 1618 or 1619. The play was not reprinted in its own era (in fact, not until 1880); but it was revived onstage around 1633.Logan and Smith, pp. 211‚Äì12. In one key respect, the Red Bull Theatre was an odd venue for the play Swetnam and its positive and genteel attitude toward women. The Red Bull had a reputation as the roughest and rowdiest of the theatres of its day, and at least one source suggests that some women avoided it. According to a contemporaneous doggerel,Grosart, p. xxxiv. > The Red Bull Is mostly full Of drovers, carriers, carters; But honest > wenches Will shun the benches And not there show their garters. Perhaps the Red Bull audience mellowed with time; or perhaps it was never as narrow and mean as reputed, as A. B. Grosart suggests in his edition of the play.Grosart, p. xxxvi. Conversely, Queen Anne's Men may have chosen the play to appeal to the \\"up-scale\\" new audience they wanted to serve. In 1617, the Queen Anne's company moved from the open-air, \\"public\\" Red Bull to the enclosed \\"private\\" theatre the Cockpit, which had a more \\"elite\\" clientele. But the crowds of apprentices who made up a large portion of the company's audience were outraged at the move. The private theatres' ticket prices were five or six times higher than the public theatres' admission fees. (In the Jacobean era, the cheapest ticket to the \\"public\\" Globe Theatre was a penny, while the minimum for the \\"private\\" Blackfriars Theatre was sixpence.) The young men were being priced out of their basic entertainment. In the famous Shrove Tuesday riot of 1617, the 'prentices damaged the Cockpit badly enough to delay its opening, and the Queen's Men had to remain at the Red Bull until repairs were done. Swetnam may have been the kind of play the company intended for their projected new home at the Cockpit. Controversy The play was one item, and apparently the final one, in a controversy that erupted in 1615 with the publication of Joseph Swetnam's crude anti-feminist tract The Arraignment of Lewd, Idle, Froward, and Unconstant Women. Swetnam's work attracted abundant attention, and provoked three responses in defence of women: Rachel Speght's A Muzzle for Melastomus\\"Melastomus\\" means \\"black mouth,\\" indicated the \\"foul-mouthed\\" Swetnam. (1617), and two works published under pseudonyms‚ÄîEsther Hath Hang'd Haman by \\"Esther Sowernam\\" and The Worming of a Mad Dog by \\"Constantia Munda\\" (both also 1617).Daniel Tuvil's Asylum Veneris (1616) is sometimes considered another response to Swetnam. The pseudonyms are thought to represent other female authors, making this polemical response to Swetnam a rare cluster of early 17th-century works written by women. The play Swetnam the Woman-Hater shows internal signs of being the final response to Swetnam in the relevant period.Logan and Smith, p. 211. More generally, Swetnam the Woman-Hater is one of a long-running series of English Renaissance plays on what can be called, very broadly, the gender question. Earlier plays in this subgenre would include Shakespeare's The Taming of the Shrew and Beaumont and Fletcher's The Woman Hater and The Woman's Prize. Beyond the confines of the drama, there was an abundant literature on the subject. Swetnam's tract was only one in a long series of similar attacks on women; countervailing defences of women were less common though not unknown‚Äîas in Protection for Women (1589), by \\"Jane Anger,\\" and The Worth of Women: Wherein is Clearly Revealed Their Nobility and Their Superiority to Men (1600), by \\"Moderata Fonte\\" (both pseudonyms). Plot source The play's subplot deals with Swetnam, who is brought to trial before a court of women for his offences against the gender and ends up recanting his bias. The play's main plot, a story of political intrigue and courtly love, derives from a novel by Juan de Flores called the Historia de Aurelio e Isabella (also known as Grisel y Mirabella), written c. 1495. (The same novel provided John Fletcher with plot material for his Women Pleased.) De Flore's novel was popular, and had been published in English translation five times between 1556 and 1586. It has been argued that the play also shows specific debts to earlier dramas, notably George Peele's The Arraignment of Paris and John Lyly's Endymion.Logan and Smith, pp. 210‚Äì11. The tone of de Flores' novel is strongly chivalric, a trait that carries over into the play. \\"Swetnam the Woman-Hater is remarkable for the unusually high moral tone it adopts with regard to women.\\"Gosse, p. 134. Authorship No external evidence indicates the identity of the play's author; Thomas Heywood, Thomas Dekker, and Thomas Drue have been proposed as candidates. (A \\"Thomas Drewe\\" acted with Queen Anne's Men in the years 1616‚Äì19; but it is not certain that Drew the actor, and Drue the playwright of The Duchess of Suffolk, were the same person.) Heywood is regarded as the best candidate for the author of Swetnam: \\"the language, dialogue, and clownery\\" of Swetnam are all typical of Heywood's style.Louis Wright, quoted in Logan and Smith, p. 212. Synopsis The play is set in Sicily, where the royal court is a grim and somber place: King Atticus is mourning the death of his eldest son and heir, Lusippus, and the prolonged absence of his second son Lorenzo. In the middle of the opening scene, news arrives that Lorenzo is missing after fighting in the Battle of Lepanto (1571), and is feared to be either dead or captured by the Ottoman Turks. The king also has a daughter, the beautiful and spirited Leonida. Yet Atticus is displeased with her: the scions of the great royal houses of Europe have come to seek her hand in marriage, but she has imperiously refused them all. The king calls her \\"wanton, coy, and fickle too;\\" he decides to punish her by restricting her social access, and puts her in the custody of his senior courtier, Nicanor. Nicanor quickly reveals himself to be both the play's villain and its senex: though an old man himself, he wants to marry Leonida and so become king after Atticus. The second scene introduces Swetnam and his servant Swash, the play's clown. The conceit is that Swetnam has been driven out of England by the public's righteous indignation over his anti-female slanders; he has moved to Sicily and taken to calling himself Misogynos. (The play provides the earliest known use in English of the term \\"misogynist.\\") Once in Sicily, however, he has fallen back into his old habit of traducing women, and is becoming notorious in his new country just as he was in his old. (The play's two opening scenes create an obvious conflict in chronology: the dramatist postulates a future, post-England Swetnam, but tosses him into 1570s Sicily. Yet such anomalies are only too common in English Renaissance drama. For extreme examples of historical anomalies and chronological conflict, see The Faithful Friends and The Old Law.) Meanwhile, the missing prince, Lorenzo, has returned clandestinely to Sicily; he wants to spy out local conditions and corruptions, unhindered by his fame and high position. Only the loyal courtier Iago is aware of his presence. Princess Leonida's current suitor is the prince of Naples, Lisandro; when Leonida is restricted from seeing him, he decides to take the bold step of masquerading as her confessor, Friar Anthony, to see her. His ardor and persistence create an impression on the young princess, and he wins her affection. But Nicanor catches the two of them together. The young couple are put on trial for violating the king's command; in the classic fairy tale tradition, the penalty they face is death. Yet at their trial, both of the accused accept blame for the infraction and exonerate the other. The judges complain to the king that they cannot decide; the king decrees that the matter will be resolved by a debate or disputation on the question of whether men or women are the morally weaker gender. Swetnam/Misogynos is delighted to take the male side in the dispute; the women's side is taken by Lorenzo, who has disguised himself \\"like an Amazon.\\" The debate is vigorous, and Lorenzo- alias-\\"Atlanta\\" does well; but the judges are all male, and Nicanor uses his corrupting influence to turn the outcome in Swetnam's favour. True to his word, Atticus condemns his daughter to death; Lisandro is sentenced to exile. In the aftermath of the debate, Swetnam surprisingly makes romantic advances to \\"Atlanta.\\" To his servant Swash, Swetnam reveals that he is in the grip of lust rather than love; but the effect is highly comic all the same. In his pursuit of \\"Atlanta,\\" Swetnam exposes himself to the revenge of the Sicilian women; they capture him, imprison him, and force him to recant and repent his bigotry against them. The play takes a specific approach to Swetnam's bias, judging his low opinion of women as a reflection of his own low quality as a human being. As Iago puts it, > ::::::He's a man, Whose breeding has been like the Scarrabee, Altogether > upon the excrement of the time; And being swol'n with poisonous vapours He > breaks wind in public, to blast the Reputation of all women; his > acquaintance Has been altogether amongst whores and bawds, And therefore > speaks but in's own element. His own unworthy foul deformity, Because no > female can affect the same, Begets in him despair; and despair, envy. He > cares not to defame their very souls, But that he's of the Turk's opinion: > they have none.Spellings modernized. The last two lines refer to the common > belief among Europeans that Muslims thought that women had no souls. In the main plot, Lorenzo and Iago stage a pretended execution of Leonida. When Lisandro sees a mock-up of her supposedly severed head, he stabs himself in a suicide attempt; his guards, fearing punishment, flee, and Lorenzo and Iago secure his wounded body and nurse him back to health. In the play's final scene, the disaffected court party, including Lorenzo, Iago, Leonida and Lisandro, and Queen Aurelia, stage a masque on the theme of repentance; Atticus is affected, emotionally and psychologically, by the masque, and expresses his own repentance over his course of action. Once that change of heart has been achieved, Lorenzo, Leonida, and Lisandro can reveal themselves. Nicanor's villainy is exposed, and he too repents; in the spirit of the moment, the king forgives him, and urges him to \\"live honestly.\\" Leonida and Lisandro can now engage to marry, and Lorenzo is the new crown prince. [The play text presents interesting questions as to its original staging, like the mock severed head of Leonida. How was Lorenzo costumed as an \\"Amazon,\\" and how did the audience interpret and understand his disguise?] Modern responses The play's status as a pro-feminist, proto-feminist, or quasi-feminist text has earned it an ever-growing body of commentary, analysis, and criticism from modern scholars. Some attention has focused on the degree to which the play is or isn't a feminist work; critics have noted that Swetnam subordinates its polemical concerns to its subplot, while the main plot deals with high-flown romantic love. The play was produced in 2004, in what is believed to be its US premiere, by the Airmid Theatre Company (www.airmidtheatre.org) as part of the Play Outside festival in New York City.

Monsen spent eleven seasons in the American Soccer League as well as several years in the lower division German American Soccer League and National Soccer League of New York. He earned three caps with the U.S. national team between 1952 and 1957 and was a member of the U.S. Olympic soccer teams at both the 1952 and 1956 Summer Olympics. He is a member of the National Soccer Hall of Fame. Soccer =Youth= Monsen‚Äôs parents immigrated to the U.S. from Norway before he was born. He was born in Brooklyn, New York and grew up in New York City, attending Fort Hamilton High School. His soccer career began when he joined the Gjoa Juniors, an ethnically Norwegian team, of the Empire State Junior League when he was sixteen. In his first season, Monsen scored fifty-six goals in both league and cup play leading to his moving up to the Gjoa first team of the National Soccer League of New York when he was seventeen. In his first season, he scored eighteen goals in league competition. =Club career= Monsen‚Äôs success with Gjoa led to his signing with the New York Americans of the American Soccer League in 1949. At the time, he was still in high school. He played with the Americans until 1952 when he was drafted into the U.S. Army. While serving in Germany, he played briefly for Hoechst S.C. He returned to the U.S. in 1953, rejoined the Americans where he was selected as team captain. In 1954, the Americans won the league title and defeated St. Louis Kutis S.C. to win the National Challenge Cup to gain a double for Monsen and his teammates. In 1956, the Americans merged with Brooklyn Hakoah to form the New York Hakoah-Americans. The Hakoah-Americans went on to win three consecutive league titles 1957, 1958, and 1959. The team also went to the 1958 National Cup only to fall to Kutis. During the 1957-1958 season, Monsen led the ASL with twenty-two goals. For the 1958-1959 season, he was on track for a second scoring title, Pasquale Pepe gained the title with several goals in the last game of league play. Lloyd Monsen nearly won his second consecutive scoring title but lost at the last minute to Pasquale Pepe of Newark Portuguese. During his ASL career, Monsen scored ninety-eight league and forty-seven cup goals. He was also 11 times an ASL All-Star. As Monsen‚Äôs career began to wane, he moved to the New York German-Hungarians of the German American Soccer League before finishing his playing career with Swedish F.C. of the National Soccer League of New York. He retired from playing professionally in 1964 but remained active with amateur over age teams until 1988. =National and Olympic teams= His first game with the senior team came in a 6-0 loss to Scotland on April 30, 1952. He did not play again until a 3-2 loss to Iceland on August 25, 1955. His last game was a 7-2 loss to Mexico in an April 28, 1957 World Cup qualifier.USA - Details of International Matches 1885-1969 Monsen was selected for the U.S. soccer team at the 1952 Summer Olympics. At that tournament, the U.S. lost 8-0 to Italy in the first round.XV. Olympiad Helsinki 1952 Football Tournament He was again selected to the U.S. team at the 1956 Summer Olympics. This time, Yugoslavia defeated the U.S., 9-1, in the first round.XVI. Olympiad Melbourne 1956 Football Tournament =Referee and administrator= On retiring from playing professionally, Monsen turned towards other soccer-related activities. In 1966, he became a referee and oversaw both amateur club and collegiate games until 1975. He was also an administrator and coach in the Long Island Soccer Football League. Baseball In 1952, Monsen was a member of the U.S. soccer team at the Helsinki Olympics. The team was eliminated in its first game, an 8-0 loss to Italy. The Finnish Olympic Committee put on a demonstration of a local version of baseball then asked the Americans to provide a team to play the locals. The U.S. team asked Walter Giesler, the coach of the U.S. soccer team, to organize a U.S. team. As his soccer players had nothing else to do, they formed the bulk of the U.S. baseball team. This team, with Lloyd Monsen as a pitcher, defeated a Venezuelan team, 14-6, on July 29. On August 5, the U.S. defeated the Finnish team, 19-1, at the Helsinki Olympic Stadium.Lloyd Monsen: left wing and pitcher at the 1952 Olympics Non-soccer employment In addition to his playing, refereeing, coaching and administering soccer, Monsen managed Republic Aviation property in Long Island.

These chemicals cleave the bonds between the cellulose and lignin components of the lignocellulose. A variety of sulfite/bisulfite salts are used, including sodium (Na+), calcium (Ca2+), potassium (K+), magnesium (Mg2+), and ammonium (NH4+). The lignin is converted to lignosulfonates, which are soluble and can be separated from the cellulose fibers. For the production of cellulose, the sulfite process competes with the Kraft process, which produces stronger fibers and is less environmentally costly. idealized scheme for lignin depolymerization by the Sulfite process. History The use of wood to make pulp for paper began with the development of mechanical pulping in the 1840s by Charles Fenerty in Nova ScotiaBurger, PeterCharles Fenerty and his Paper Invention. Toronto: Peter Burger, 2007. pp.25‚Äì30 and by F. G. Keller in Germany. Chemical processes quickly followed, first with Julius Roth's use of sulfurous acid to treat wood in 1857, followed by Benjamin Chew Tilghman's US patent on the use of calcium bisulfite, Ca(HSO3)2, to pulp wood in 1867. Almost a decade later in 1874 the first commercial sulfite pulp mill was built in Sweden. It used magnesium as the counter ion and was based on work by Carl Daniel Ekman. By 1900 sulfite pulping had become the dominant means of producing wood pulp, surpassing mechanical pulping methods. The competing chemical pulping process, the sulfate or kraft process was developed by Carl F. Dahl in 1879 and the first kraft mill started (in Sweden) in 1890. The first sulphite mill in the United States was the Richmond Paper Company in Rumford, Rhode Island in the mid-1880s. The invention of the recovery boiler by G. H. Tomlinson in the early 1930s allowed kraft mills to recycle almost all of their pulping chemicals. This, along with the ability of the kraft process to accept a wider variety of types of wood and produce stronger fibers made the kraft process the dominant pulping process starting in the 1940s. Sulfite pulps now account for less than 10% of the total chemical pulp production and the number of sulfite mills continues to decrease. Magnesium was the standard counter ion until calcium replaced it in the 1950s. Pulping liquor preparation The pulping liquor for most sulfite mills is treating various bases (alkali metal or alkaline earth hydroxides) with sulfur dioxide: :SO2 \\\\+ MOH ‚Üí MHSO3 :MHSO3 \\\\+ MOH ‚Üí M2SO3 \\\\+ H2O Siimilar reactions are effected with divalent cations (Mg2+, Ca2+) and using carbonates in place of hydroxide. The ratio of sulfite to bisulfite depends on pH, above pH=7, sulfite predominates. ;Calcium-based The earliest process used calcium, obtained as inexpensive calcium carbonate, and there was little incentive to recover the inorganic materials. At least in Sweden the brown liquor from this process was previously frequently used for producing ethanol, while with other brown liquors the fermentable hexose sugars are left to contribute to the energy needed in the recovery process. Calcium sulfite, which is poorly soluble, converts to calcium bisulfite only at low pH. Therefore calcium-based sulfite processes require acidic conditions. ;Ammonia-based Ammonia-based processes do not allow recovery of the pulping chemicals since ammonia or ammonium salts are oxidized to nitrogen and nitrogen oxides when burned. ;Magnesium-based The recovery process used in magnesium-based sulfite pulping the \\"Magnefite\\" process is well developed. The concentrated brown liquor is burned in a recovery boiler, producing magnesium oxide and sulfur dioxide, both of which are recovered from the flue gases. Magnesium oxide is recovered in a wet scrubber to give a slurry of magnesium hydroxide. :MgO + H2O ‚Üí Mg(OH)2 This magnesium hydroxide slurry is then used in another scrubber to absorb sulfur dioxide from the flue gases producing a magnesium bisulfite solution that is clarified, filtered and used as the pulping liquor. :Mg(OH)2 \\\\+ 2 SO2 ‚Üí Mg(HSO3)2 ;Sodium-based Sodium-based processes use a recovery system similar to that used in the kraft recovery process, except that there is no \\"lime cycle\\". Processes involved in sulfite pulping The process is conducted in large pressure vessels called digesters. Sulfite pulping is carried out between pH 1.5 and 5. The pulp is in contact with the pulping chemicals for 4 to 14 hours and at temperatures ranging from 130 to 160 ¬∞C (266 to 320 ¬∞F), again depending on the chemicals used. Most of the intermediates involved in delignification in sulfite pulping are resonance- stabilized carbocations formed either by protonation of carbon-carbon double bonds or acidic cleavage of ether bonds which connect many of the constituents of lignin. It is the latter reaction which is responsible for most lignin degradation in the sulfite process. The electrophilic carbocations react with bisulfite ions (HSO3‚àí)to give sulfonates. :R-O-R' + H+ ‚Üí R+ \\\\+ R'OH :R+ \\\\+ HSO3‚àí ‚Üí R-SO3H The sulfite process does not degrade lignin to the same extent that the kraft process does and the lignosulfonates from the sulfite process are useful byproducts. =Chemical recovery= The spent cooking liquor from sulfite pulping is usually called brown liquor, but the terms red liquor, thick liquor and sulfite liquor are also used (compared to black liquor in the kraft process). Pulp washers, using countercurrent flow, remove the spent cooking chemicals and degraded lignin and hemicellulose. The extracted brown liquor is concentrated, in multiple effect evaporators. The concentrated brown liquor can be burned in the recovery boiler to generate steam and recover the inorganic chemicals for reuse in the pulping process or it can be neutralized to recover the useful byproducts of pulping. Recent developments in Chemrec's black liquor gasification process, adapting the technology to use in the sulfite pulping process, could make second generation biofuels production an alternative to the conventional recovery boiler technology.Chemrec web site Around 1906 G√∂sta Ekstr√∂m a Swedish engineer patented a process of ethanol generation from the residual 2-2.5% fermentable hexose sugars in the spent liquor. The sulfite process can use calcium, ammonium, magnesium or sodium as a base. Applications The sulfite process is acidic and one of the drawbacks is that the acidic conditions hydrolyze some of the cellulose, which means that sulfite pulp fibers are not as strong as kraft pulp fibers. The yield of pulp (based on wood used) is higher than for kraft pulping and sulfite pulp is easier to bleach. =Commodity= Sulfite pulp remains an important commodity, especially for specialty papers and as a source of cellulose for non-paper applications. It is used to make fine paper, tissue, glassine. and to add strength to newsprint. =Dissolving pulp= A special grade of bleached sulfite pulp is known as dissolving pulp which is the raw material for a wide variety of cellulose derivatives, for example rayon, cellophane, cellulose acetate and methylcellulose. Rayon is a reconstituted cellulose fiber used to make many fabrics. Cellophane is a clear reconstituted cellulose film used in wrapping and windows in envelopes. Cellulose acetate was used to make flexible films for photographic use, computer tapes and so on and also to make fibers. Methylcellulose and other cellulose ether derivatives are used in a wide range of everyday products from adhesives to baked goods to pharmaceuticals. Byproducts Sulfite pulping is generally less destructive than kraft pulping, so there are more usable byproducts. =Lignosulfonates= Chief among sulfite process byproducts are lignosulfonates, which find a wide variety of uses where a relatively inexpensive agent is needed to make a water dispersion of a water-insoluble material. Lignosulfonates are used in tanning leather, making concrete, drilling mud, drywall and so on. Oxidation of lignosulfonates was used to produce vanillin (artificial vanilla), and this process is still used by one supplier (Borregaard, Norway) while all North American production by this route ceased in the 1990s. =Other byproducts= Acid hydrolysis of hemicelluloses during sulfite pulping produces monosaccharides, predominantly mannose for softwoods and xylose for hardwoods, which can be fermented to produce ethanol.

Villa Mella is located north of the Isabela River, about 6 miles (or 10 kilometers) to the north of the center of Santo Domingo, and is considered an additional neighborhood of the capital. This sector is considered one of the economically stable areas in the Santo Domingo metropolitan area. It is also home to the musical organization known as the Brotherhood of the Holy Spirit of the Congos of Villa Mella, recognized in 2001 by UNESCO. UNESCO recognition Villa Mella is known for its retention and preservation of African cultural roots and heritage.

The Esp√≠ritu Santo (Holy Spirit) is considered the patron of the area (which originally developed from bateyes in what was formerly known as Sabana Grande del Esp√≠ritu Santo), and is syncretized with Kalunga, which represents both the god of the dead and the gateway to the world of the ancestors in some traditional religions of the Congo region.

He gained notoriety for evading calls for his prosecution across four countries, more than once under the threat of deportation. Early life Kalƒìjs was born in Riga, Latvia, Russian Empire, in 1913. In 1935 he joined the Latvian army as a cadet, and attained the rank of lieutenant four years later. Activities under Nazi occupation In 1941, following the German invasion of Latvia as part of Operation Barbarossa, Kalƒìjs deserted the Red Army (Latvia by that stage having been occupied by the Soviet Union) and became a member of the Nazi-controlled Latvian security police. Kalƒìjs would later assert that he worked as a farmhand during this period. It was common practice in occupied nations for indigenous security forces to act in support of German military and security forces in the collection, interrogation, and transport of \\"undesirables\\"; such as Jews, Roma, Communists and partisans. Life after World War II At the end of the war Kalƒìjs moved to Denmark. In 1950 he emigrated to Australia, where he was employed at the Bonegilla Migrant Reception and Training Centre in north-east Victoria. Becoming an Australian citizen in 1957, Kalƒìjs later left for the United States in 1959 for a lucrative career in property development. U.S. visa revoked In 1984, Kalƒìjs' Nazi connections were revealed, and he was arrested the following year after walking into the Pu√±o Airlines sting operation.Turner Publishing, \\"Retired US Marshals Association\\", p. 25 *To correct the record...This arrest did not take place as a result of Kalejs walking into an airline office in a sting operation. He was arrested by a US Marshal and Miami-Dade Police Detectives from the Department's Warrants Bureau, at his small motel room on Miami Beach. Sgt K. Dougherty https://www.upi.com/Archives/1985/04/22/Alleged- Nazi-war-criminal-found-in-Miami-Beach/6561482994000/ ''' After a four-year process, a United States court revoked Kalƒìjs' visa, having found that there was \\"unequivocal evidence\\" that he had participated in war crimes in Latvia, although as an Australian citizen Kalƒìjs was not prosecuted. The United States Department of Justice alleged that between July 1941 and June or July 1944, Kalƒìjs was a company commander in the notorious Arajs Kommando (Sonderkommando Arajs), one of several security police units which assisted the Einsatzgruppen death squads in killing Jews and Roma in Latvia, and in guarding the Salaspils concentration camp. According to renowned Holocaust scholar Raul Hilberg, who gave evidence during the American proceedings against Kalƒìjs, German documents established that the Einsatzkommando, the Arajs Kommando and similar groups were responsible for killing about 29,000 people (including about 26,000 Jews) by August 1941 and a further 27,800 Jews near Riga by the end of 1941 (the Arajs Kommando were responsible for about half of this total). Deportation and last years Kalƒìjs was deported from the United States to Australia after a six-year-long appeals process, and then moved to Canada, where in 1997 he was once again deported to Australia after a court again revoked his visa, finding that he had \\"committed war crimes\\" as a collaborator. In 1999, Kalƒìjs left Australia for the United Kingdom, where he settled in Catthorpe, Leicestershire, staying at Catthorpe Manor, a nursing home run by the Latvian Welfare Fund. After being discovered, then Home Secretary Jack Straw announced that moves would be made to deport Kalƒìjs, at which point he returned to Australia. The Simon Wiesenthal Center, which had uncovered Kalƒìjs' presence in Catthorpe, criticised Straw's decision: a spokesperson labelled it a \\"missed opportunity\\" to prosecute him, and warned that \\"if he returns to Australia he will benefit from the country's lax attitude towards Nazi war criminals.\\" Latvian authorities finally charged Kalƒìjs with war crimes offences in September 2000, relating to his participation at the Salaspils labour camp, and in May 2001 a Melbourne court ordered Kalƒìjs' extradition to Latvia. Kalƒìjs appealed this decision, and the ensuing proceedings were delayed by illness, with Kalƒìjs reportedly suffering from dementia and prostate cancer at the time. His lawyers claimed he was blind and had lost his memory. Kalƒìjs died in Melbourne in November 2001, aged 88. His lawyers criticised the government of Australia for being \\"inhumane and callous in its bid to extradite a sick old man\\" and described the process as a \\"witch hunt\\". Kalƒìjs eventually admitted to working for the Nazi-run Latvian police in his last Australian interview.

Specific incidents that this expression may refer to are all in the Mahdist War in the Sudan: * At the Battle of Abu Klea: the breach was small and soon closed itself, leaving the intruders trapped inside the square, whose inner ranks faced-about and quickly defeated the intruders. See Battle of Abu Klea#Battle for the real events at Abu Klea. *:See the end of the section Battle of Abu Klea#Battle about a wrong or mistaken report in The Times newspaper after the battle that a British square broke. * At the Battle of Tamai: *# The Black Watch formed one side of a big square under attack, and was ordered by top command to leave that post (leaving their side of that square open) and attack another enemy force which was hidden down a desert gully. *# The restricted rocky irregular ground in that gully made it difficult to form a solid square to resist attack; that square came under intense attack from Sudanese (here, mostly Hadendoa). The square was flooded with a rush of tribesmen and a brutal hand-to-hand fight resulted. The Black Watch were driven back but rallied and eventually drove the Sudanese out, with the square being reformed. After the Mahdist War, the poet Sir Henry Newbolt got his information very wrong (and may have confused these two battles with each other) and wrote a poem named Vita√Ø Lampada describing a disastrous collapse. Or he may have intended to write a fictional \\"worst case\\" scenario, with the message \\"even if the worst happens, keep on fighting back\\", but many readers thought wrongly that he was describing real events. Frank Richards, a soldier in the Royal Welch Fusiliers around 1901, stated in his memoir entitled 'Soldier Sahib': \\"If a Welshman went into a pub where a Highland soldier was, of the regiment whose square was once broken by the Mahdi's dervishes in the Sudan, he would sometimes ask for a 'pint of broken-square'. Then he would have his bellyful of scrapping for the rest of the night, because this was an insult the Highlanders could not forgive.\\" Robert Graves, who also served in the Royal Welch, told a similar story. Graves, Robert Goodbye to All That In Spain in the Napoleonic War, at the Battle of Garc√≠a Hern√°ndez, three French squares were broken in the same day resulting in a very one sided victory for the British and Germans. For more information about infantry squares breaking or not breaking, see Battle of Garc√≠a Hern√°ndez#Commentary. In the Napoleonic Wars, when cavalry broke an infantry square, it was usually because one of more of: *The infantry were of poor quality. *The infantry were tired or disorganized or discouraged *It was raining, with risk of rain wetting the men's gunpowder, as firearms were at the time. *The infantry fired a poorly aimed volley. *The infantry waited too long to fire.

He also is known for his work on the Bailey Fountain in Grand Army Plaza, Brooklyn, New York and the 'Alma Mater' mural featured in the Sterling Memorial Library on the campus of Yale University located in New Haven, CT. Biography Savage was born in Covington, Indiana. In 1915, while studying at the Chicago Art Institute, he won the Rome Prize in painting, enabling him to study at the American Academy in Rome, where he received a bachelor of arts degree.The date is sometimes incorrectly given as 1912. Later he received Bachelor of Arts (1924) and Master of Fine Arts from Yale University. Savage subsequently taught at the Yale School of Art and Architecture for twenty-eight years, where he was the Leffingwell Professor of Painting & Design. \\"Morning\\", the work with which Savage won the Rome Prize in painting. Savage's training in Early Renaissance techniques strongly influence his style. He was also strongly influenced by Thomas Hart Benton. Other contemporary influences on his public art were his Latin American contemporaries Diego Rivera and Jos√© Clemente Orozco. Savage's influence was extended by his service on high-profile arts committees. While acting as a member of the Fine Arts committee of the American Academy in Rome, he ensured, though not a member of the jury, that a generation of winning artists were painting in the manner of Thomas Hart Benton or Savage himself.Because of his purported influence, awardees were known as \\"little Savages\\", according to TIME (1932). He became an Associate Member of the National Academy of Design, 1924 and National Academician, 1926. Savage also served on the U.S. Commission of Fine Arts from 1933 to 1941 and was a member of the American Academy of Arts and Letters, to which he was elected in 1936. Works Bailey Fountain, Grand Army Plaza, Brooklyn, New York, 1932 Savage was commissioned by the Matson Navigation Company to paint nine 4 by 8 foot Hawaiian-themed murals in Hawaii. They were completed in 1940, but never installed in the company's ships, which had been converted to troopships. In 1948, lithographs based on these murals were used as menu covers on Matson's flagship, SS Lurline.HawaiianDays.com In 1935 and 1953 Savage visited Florida, where he painted the experience of the Seminole in their Everglades, taking note of the intrusion of modern civilization into what seemed to be a Garden of Eden pastoral existence. These paintings were done at the same time the effort was under way to create the Everglades National Park Murals by Savage are on the campuses of Purdue, Columbia and Yale Universities. At Yale, he oversaw the decorative painting of Sterling Memorial Library and painted the library's Alma Mater mural. His work also features in government buildings in Connecticut, the Elks National Veterans Memorial in Chicago, the new Post Office Building (now William Jefferson Clinton Federal Building) in Washington, in Indiana and the renovated Court of Appeals Hall, Albany, New York (1959). He also did the Great Hall murals in the Hall of State at Fair Park for the 1936 Texas Centennial Exposition in Dallas, Texas. After World War II, Savage designed and installed the colored glass mosaic map at the American Cemetery in √âpinal France. The mosaic depicts American and Allied military operations of Operation Dragoon from the landing in southern France on 15 August 1944 to the junction with Allied Forces advancing from Normandy on 11 September at Sombernon, near Dijon; and their subsequent advances after turning eastward, crossing the Rhine and sweeping across Germany to meet with the spearhead of the U.S. Fifth Army south of the Brenner Pass. The mosaic, 54' feet long and 14' feet high, was designed utilizing data provided by the American Battle Monuments Commission. The map is laid out in perspective as seen from the south; consequently, the lines of the longitude and latitude are tilted to accommodate the map to the proportions of the room. Thus, north is toward the upper right instead of vertically upward. Symbolically, the figures on the semi-circular wall depict the Spirit of Columbia leading the Army, Navy, and Air Forces to the landings on the south coast of France. The final victory is symbolized by the Angel of Victory with laurel branch above the central altar; a group composed of trumpets; the American and French flags emerging from the clouds of war and the outstretched hands of women who offer flowers as tribute to the victors. In the border of the map are the insignia of all military units of division size or larger that participated in ground operations in the region.Saturday Evening Post August 14, 1954 The 14'x4' foot 4 panel oil on board study for the glass mosaic at the Epinal American Cemetery and Memorial currently hangs at the Military Heritage Collection of North Texas 35 miles north east of Dallas, TX in Nevada, TX.Per Military Heritage Collection of North Texas/Fox 4 News Dallas/Owner of Painting J.Bender In other media, he provided illustrations for Coningsby Dawson's Christmas Outside of Eden.

Two of his partners also became infected with HIV. One of the two had a child from the union with Monge and the child also contracted HIV. (He was also convicted of one count of unlawfully causing bodily harm to the baby by having unprotected sex with her mother.)Canlii Sexual relationships Monge contracted HIV from his late wife, who died of AIDS complications in November 1999. She contracted the virus from a blood transfusion in Nicaragua in 1981. He learned he was HIV positive in November 1999, shortly before his wife died. Monge commenced his first sexual relationship in January 2000, in spite of a doctor warning him about the risks and advised him to reveal his being HIV positive to potential partners and to use a condom as the protection. Monge explained that he did not inform his sexual partners because he did not have time and because several of the women were too immature to handle the problem. The sentencing judge called the explanations \\"pathetic\\". According to the evidence presented in court, Monge had the following overlapping unprotected sexual relationships with women: * Victim #1: January 1, 2000 - June 30, 2000. She tested negative for HIV. * Victim #2: June 1, 2000 - May 30, 2001. She is now HIV positive. She became pregnant and her baby contracted HIV. * Victim #3: January 1, 2001 - June 30, 2001. Victim #3 was a teenager. She tested negative for HIV, but developed a sexually transmitted disease. * Victim #4: February 1, 2001 - April 30, 2001. Met Monge at church. Tested HIV positive in September 2001. In the case of Victim #2, who became pregnant from Monge, he did not tell her he was HIV positive during their relationship and did not tell her after learning she was pregnant. This prevented the mother from taking medication that might have reduced the risk of transmission of the virus to her baby girl during pregnancy. She also practised breastfeeding, perhaps unknowingly passing the virus to the baby girl that way. According to the evidence presented in court, when one victim broke up with him Monge told her \\"I gave you a present that no other guy can give you. I gave you AIDS\\". Monge knew he was HIV positive and took precautions to protect his four children, for example wearing latex gloves when he cooked and letting another sibling shower his youngest daughter. Soon to be released from prison (Frontenac Institution), Monge has met a woman at a church he goes to on Sunday. They plan to be married once Monge is released and to reside in Nicaragua. The Correctional Service of Canada has denied his request for marriage. Sentence On June 27, 2002, Justice Steve Glithero of the Ontario Superior Court of Justice sentenced Monge to ten years in prison. The judge said: > \\"This is a man who carried on four sexual affairs of significant length > involving frequent sex.... He knowingly and repeatedly risked the very lives > of four women and a child by his callous actions which persisted over > months. He's largely responsible for the ruination of three lives. The > effect of his actions is tragic and immense.... His actions show a callous > and cruel disregard for his own flesh and blood....

BƒÉl»õi is the second largest city in Moldova. It is located in the northern part of the country, within the historical region of Bessarabia, with which the city's own history is closely intertwined.  Middle Ages  During the European Middle Ages, the fair belonged to Soroca, then after 1785 to the Ia»ôi »õinut (county) of the Principality of Moldova. BƒÉl»õi was a crossroad, with post-roads from Ia»ôi, Hotin, Soroca, and Orhei intersecting. It soon became a renowned horse fair, and also a cattle fair. In 1469, a Crimean Tatar invasion led by the khan Me√±li I Giray burned BƒÉl»õi to the ground, before the invaders were defeated in the Battle of Lipnic (about 100 km to the north). The site was rebuilt, though very slowly. Over the years, BƒÉl»õi also became a center of handicraft, with smiths, wheelwrights, leather dressers, saddlers, and cartwrights.  Eighteenth century  In 1711, the Moldavian prince Dimitrie Cantemir, who was also a well-known European historiographer and scientist of the time ‚Äì impressed by the defeat of the Swedish-Polish king Charles XII at the Battle of Poltava (600 km to the east in Ukraine) by the young Russian tsar Peter the Great ‚Äì invited the tsar to Moldavia in a bold move to try to end Ottoman suzerainty and reclaim the independence of Moldavia. The country formally became a vassal to the Ottoman Empire in 1538; it almost completely preserved its self-rule but needed to pay an ever-increasing annual tribute. During this failed military campaign, BƒÉl»õi, due to its crossroads location, served as a major headquarters of the Russian army and parts of the Moldavian armies. The town was again burned to the ground: according to one version, this was done as a retaliatory measure by Nohai Tatars; according to another account, the burning was done by the retreating Russians. The development of the town, as well as of the entire country in the 18th century, suffered because the population had to support the burdens of regular invasions of three foreign armies ‚Äì Ottoman, Russian, and Habsburg ‚Äì which clashed in four major wars, pillaged, and performed extensive requisitions to supply their troops. The warring sides sometimes established separate administrations, with each side imposing serfdom-like obligations to provide labor for the movements and encampments of their own armies and exacting punishment when the residents fulfilled these same obligations for the other armies. The last vestiges of serfdom were formally abolished in Moldavia in 1749. In 1766, the Moldavian prince Alexandru Ghica divided the BƒÉl»õi estate into two parts, awarding one to the Saint Spiridon monastery of Ia≈üi and the other to the merchant brothers Alexandru, Constantin, and Iordache Panaiti. Over the next decades, the three brothers improved and developed the locality, settled farmers, and encouraged handicrafts and traders. Moldavian voevodes built a basilica in the town in 1785. The same year, the land around the city was transferred from Soroca county to Ia≈üi county, and BƒÉl»õi was the second largest locality in the county.  Nineteenth century  In 1812 ‚Äì after a six-year war ‚Äì the Treaty of Bucharest saw the Ottoman Empire, then Moldavia's suzerain, cede the eastern half of the country (including the town of BƒÉl»õi) to the Russian Empire, under the name of Bessarabia.Prior to 1812, the name Bessarabia extended only to its southern quarter. BƒÉl»õi benefited from the division of the Principality of Moldavia along the River Prut in 1812, because although the city of Ia≈üi remained on the right (west) bank, the largest part of Ia≈üi County was on the left (east) bank, and BƒÉl»õi, then with a population of 8,000, gradually became its natural center. In 1818, the town had serendipitously received formal city rights. According to a popular legend, the Russian tsar Alexander I visited his newly acquired province, and during his passing through BƒÉl»õi he received news that he had a nephew: the future tsar Alexander II of Russia, had been born. Overjoyed, he granted BƒÉl»õi official city status, turning it into the administrative center of the county. In 1828, the number of counties of Bessarabia was reduced from twelve to eight, but Ia≈üi County was preserved, and in 1887 it was renamed BƒÉl»õi County. The 1826 Balti coat of arms. Under Russian rule, the ethnic composition of the city diversified, and its economic development saw people arriving from Austrian Galicia and Russian Podolia, and some also from Russia proper (in particular Old Believers). Some of the new settlers were offered land; others sought freedom of religion, as the western provinces of the Russian Empire ‚Äì and especially Bessarabia ‚Äì were more liberal religiously and lacked serfdom. A significant number of Jews (from Galicia ‚Äì then in the Habsburg Empire) ‚Äì settled in BƒÉl»õi; by the end of the century they had become a plurality, and later a majority. At its peak (before World War I), the Jewish community accounted for over 10,000 people, or up to 70% of the population of BƒÉl»õi. Over time, 72 synagogues were built in the city.

The city was a regional center for the collection of wheat and other crops, which were then transported by railroad to Odessa. It also gradually developed into a center of commerce in Bessarabia, primarily dealing with cattle. At the beginning of the 20th century, BƒÉl»õi was an industrial city with a well-established commerce and many small factories.  Twentieth century up to 1989 = World War I period = On , the city hosted a County Congress of Farmers ‚Äì the largest of its kind in Bessarabia ‚Äì which sent representatives to the National Diet (Sfatul »öƒÉrii). Pantelimon Halippa, Anatolie Moraru, \\"Testament pentru urma≈üi\\", M√ºnchen, 1967, reprint Hyperion, Chi≈üinƒÉu, 1991, p. 70 At the outset of World War I, most men in the region between the ages of 18 and 45 were enrolled in the Russian army, and subsequently self-organized into Moldavian Soldiers' Committees. They became a political force which drove many of the subsequent changes. In October/November 1917, after the dissolution of the Russian Empire, Bessarabia elected its Sfatul »öƒÉrii, which opened on 21 November / 3 December 1917. The Diet proclaimed the Moldavian Democratic Republic on 2/15 December 1917; formed a government on 8/21 December 1917; proclaimed independence from Russia on 24 January / 6 February 1918; and then united itself with the Kingdom of Romania on 27 March / 9 April 1918 ). One of the city's representatives, a Mr. Trofim, gave a speech at the opening of the Sfatul ≈¢arii. BƒÉl»õi was not affected by World War I, aside from the recruitment and movement of troops. On 17/30 May 1917, General Shcherbachov, Supreme Commander of the Russian Armies on the Romanian Front, consented to the request of the Moldavian Central Soldiers' Committee of All Bessarabia to form 16 cohorts, made up exclusively of Moldavian soldiers and commanded by Moldavian officers, and distributed them to all the counties of Bessarabia.Halipa, Moraru, p. 144 Ion Nistor \\"Istoria Basarabiei\\", 3rd edition, CernƒÉu≈£i, 1923, reprint Cartea MoldoveneascƒÉ, Chi≈üinƒÉu, 1991, p. 275 In September, their number was further increased due to the pillaging and violence caused by deserters from the Russian army passing through the province. Although most of the deserter gangs were small in size, there were also several large ones. Two Cossack regiments remained in BƒÉl»õi county. Additionally, the leadership of a 3,000-strong infantry detachment in Orhei faltered; this resulted in extensive pillaging of BƒÉl»õi, Soroca and Orhei counties, with many dead, including several Bessarabian public personalities ‚Äì an incident which caused an outcry among the inhabitants of the area.Halipa, Moraru, p. 70, p. 144Nistor, p. 275 The committees of the two regiments stationed in BƒÉl»õi county adopted resolutions calling for continuous sacking until the soldiers were given discharge papers. In December 1917, when the Directorate General for Armed Forces of the Moldavian Democratic Republic was formed, one of its first units was in BƒÉl»õi, where the Russian Empire's 478th Druzhina (popular militia unit) ‚Äì composed almost entirely of Moldavians and led by Captain Anatolie Popa ‚Äì was nationalized.Halipa, Moraru, p. 75-76 In March 1918, the BƒÉl»õi Council of Landowners, along with those of Soroca and Orhei, submitted resolutions to the Sfatul »öƒÉrii, asking it to consider union with Romania ‚Äì a request that soon became reality.Nistor, p. 282 = Inter-war period = Constantine and Elena Cathedral, depicted on a 1997 postage stamp of the Republic of Moldova. Coat of arms of BƒÉl»õi during the period between the First and Second World Wars. The economy of BƒÉl»õi expanded in the first part of the 20th century, and the town/city started to diversify. Many buildings in BƒÉl»õi date from the inter- war period. During the 1920s, the seat of the Bishopric was moved from Hotin to BƒÉl≈£i. With the effort of Visarion Puiu, construction began on the Bishopric Palace, which was completed in 1933. The Saint Constantine and Elena Cathedral was finished in 1932 and officially inaugurated in 1933, in the presence of the Romanian royal family. According to the Romanian official census for 1930, BƒÉl»õi had a population of 30,570, comprising 14,200 Jews, 8,900 Romanians, 5,400 Russians and Ukrainians, and 1,000 Poles. 14,400 of the inhabitants were Christian Orthodox, 14,250 Jewish, and 1,250 Roman Catholic. In that year, the city represented only 7.9% of the population of the surrounding BƒÉl»õi County (it would be 30% of the same territory today). By 1940, the city had reached close to 40,000 inhabitants. Approximately 45‚Äì46% were Jews, 29‚Äì30% were Romanians, and the rest were Ukrainians, Russians, Poles, and Germans. = World War II period = After the Soviet occupation of Bessarabia and Northern Bukovina in 1940, thousands of former teachers, doctors, office workers, and even better-to-do peasants from northern Bessarabia, thought to be hostile and dangerous to the Soviet regime, were gathered and deported in cattle cars to Siberia. BƒÉl≈£i, as the most important railroad link in the north, served as a gathering point for this operation. The largest deportation occurred on 12‚Äì13 June 1941 from the Slobozia Railway Station. Alexandru Usatiuc-BulgƒÉr \\"Cu g√Ændul la \\"O lume √Æntre douƒÉ lumi\\": eroi, martiri, oameni-legendƒÉ\\" (\\"Thinking of 'A World between Two Worlds': Heroes, Martyrs, Legendary People\\"), Publisher: Lyceum, Orhei (1999), The local economy (numerous small factories and shops) was largely dismantled during the evacuation; several factories and buildings were blown up. From 22 June to 26 July 1941, the Romanian Army participated in Operation M√ºnchen, an Axis offensive against the Red Army in Bessarabia. After developing bridgeheads across the Prut, the army proceeded with its main advance on 2 July. According to the will of its new ally (Nazi Germany), Romania ‚Äì now led by a pro-Fascist dictatorship ‚Äì allotted an 80‚Äìkm‚Äìlong segment between its two armies to the 11th German Army, which comprised both German and Romanian units under German command. This portion of the frontline included BƒÉl≈£i.Operation M√ºnchen ‚Äì (German-Romanian) annexation (of) Bessarabia and Northern Bukovina (from USSR) ‚Äì 1941 The intent was for the city to be conquered by the 14th Romanian Division from the 30th German Corps, supported by the 170th German Division from the 54th German Corps. Soviet units managed to temporarily stop them on 4 July on the eastern outskirts of the town. The 2nd and 3rd Battalions of the 13th Romanian Doroban≈£i regiment ≈ûtefan cel Mare of the 14th Division maneuvered to the south and took the village of Biliceni and surrounding areas, at which time the 14th Division was transferred to the 54th German Corps. The German motorized columns and the 1st Romanian Armored Division started to move from bridgeheads on the river Prut, and by 5 July separated the Soviet Army in northern Moldavia (Bessarabia) into pockets of resistance ‚Äì the largest of which, composed of Soviet 74th Infantry Division, 2nd Mechanized Corps (211th Motorized Division, 11th and 16th Tank Divisions), and cavalry units, was centered at BƒÉl≈£i. Opposing them were the Romanian 5th and 14th Infantry Divisions, and the German 170th Infantry Division from the German 30th Army Corps. At first the Soviets managed to stop the Romanians and Germans before the village of RƒÉu≈£el, BƒÉl≈£i's SW suburb. The main military actions took part between 7 and 9 July near the villages south of the city. The 8th (Doroban»õi) Regiment and the 32nd (Mircea) Infantry Regiment, both from the 5th Romanian Infantry Division, clashed with the Soviet cavalry. Feeling much easier on the ground than the German and Soviet units, they managed to overcome several Soviet strongholds near Zg√Ærde≈üti, M√Ændre≈üti, and the Gliceni Forest. Then, supported by four artillery battalions, the 32nd Regiment attacked M√Ændre≈üti frontally with one battalion and with the second maneuvered to the south, threatening the rear of the Soviet forces, which retreated, leaving much of their heavy weaponry behind. On 8 July, the 22nd Regiment of the 13th Romanian Division also joined the battle for BƒÉl≈£i, fighting at Singureni and ≈¢ƒÉrinei Hill. The latter, together with the 39th Romanian Infantry Regiment from the 14th Romanian Division, reached the river RƒÉut at 10:00 on 9 July and managed to establish a bridgehead north of RƒÉut near Elisabeta, already on the northeastern outskirt of the city. This threatened to encircle the Red Army units in the city, which then hastily withdrew. Reinhard Heydrich, the chief of the German Reich Security Main Office (), flew several fighter missions in his private modified Bf 109 from the BƒÉl≈£i-City Airport in July 1941. Heydrich was shot down by Soviet anti-air fire over Ukraine and barely escaped capture after having to swim for his life. Upon the Axis capture of the city, a 20-strong unit of the German SS Einsatzkommando D murdered about 200 Jews in the city over three days. The majority of the 15,000‚Äìstrong Jewish population of the city had managed to escape in the previous two weeks. The Soviet authorities organized their evacuation by railway, in cattle cars, to Central Asia, mostly to Uzbekistan. Although the majority survived and returned to the city after the war, their lives as refugees and on the road were harsh, due to the absence of regular supplies or normal housing. In August 1941, there were 1,300 Jews left in BƒÉl≈£i, and the pro-fascist government of Ion Antonescu decided to deport them. In September 1941, they, together with other Jews from the county, were gathered into two ghettos, in RƒÉu≈£el and AlexƒÉndreni, with around 3,500 persons in each. In about 10 days, the ghettos were dissolved and the approximately 11,000 Jews were hastily moved, mostly during the night, to a concentration camp in MƒÉrcule≈üi. After two more weeks, this camp was also disbanded, and the Jews were deported to occupied Transnistria. This process allowed their persecutors to strip the Jews of most of their belongings, as well as prevent the public from knowing about the true fate of the Jews before everything was accomplished. The Holocaust affected nearly 75,000 Bessarabian Jews, as well as many Bukovinian and Transnistrian Jews; less than one third of the deported Jews survived.In towns such as Mohyliv-Podilskyi, Yampil, Bershad and others, ghettos were fenced out, and Jews were settled in. Being deprived of the right to own agricultural land or hold any public positions ‚Äì often without clean water and having insufficient housing ‚Äì many became ill from malnutrition and infections. The Jews from Romania who were not affected by the deportation were treated quite tolerably by the Romanian authorities and were even allowed to visit the ghettos to deliver food and clothing. However, few ventured to do this. In several of these places, the retreating German troops in 1944 shot every Jew in order to cover up the existence of the ghetto camps. Despite the fact that 70% of the Jews who survived within territory under Soviet occupation during World war II were in Transnistria, over 70% of those deported did not survive 1944.Ghettos and concentration camps on the territory of the Soviet Union Between 27 February and 2 March 1944, Soviet troops, driving Romanian and German forces westwards, entered the city. West of BƒÉl≈£i, they first reached and crossed the Soviet border on 22 June 1944. In the summer of 1944, the Soviets created two POW camps in the city ‚Äì a small one within the present location of the military base, and a larger one at the southeastern outskirts of the city ‚Äì by fencing out several blocks of one-story houses. The camps contained up to 45,000 prisoners at a time, most of whom were Romanian POWs. Some prisoners ended up in the camp as late as September‚ÄìOctober 1944, after fighting in the Romanian army on the Allies' side, being injured and sent to hospitals close to their homes, and subsequently being arrested by Soviet authorities. In total, about 55,000 persons passed through this camp, comprising about 45,000 Romanians (up to half of which were locals), about 5,000 Germans, about 3,000 Italians, about 2,000 Hungarians, Poles and Czechs.Most of the German units were annihilated, while most of the Romanian ones were interred in these camps. Italians, Hungarians, Poles and Czechs were part of units fighting on the Axis side. The concentration camp served as a selection of the most fit labor force, and the conditions inside were very harsh, with most of the prisoners living for months under the open sky, without hygiene and with very little food. It was disbanded in 1945, after the survivors of the winter had been gradually moved to labor camps in the interior of the USSR. In August 1944, when German aviation was regularly attacking the nearby military airport, the Soviets arranged the night illumination of the camp to resemble that of the airport, deceiving the bombers into bombing the camp. The holes produced by the bombs were then used to dump the bodies of the dead. After the war, the camp was leveled and the resulting field was left to grow over. The spreading of information about the camp was severely prosecuted during Soviet rule. Under perestroika during the 1980s, the city authorities ‚Äì unaware of the past use of the land ‚Äì planned to develop the area, but the construction of a new road ran upon one of the mass graves, at which point the workers refused to continue. In 1990, mentions of the POW camp were allowed in the press. A cross was erected for the victims of the camp, since research at the time had led to a large number of locals found among the camps' victims,\\"Curierul de Nord\\", 1992 and an ossuary church is currently under construction. The Soviet archives preserved considerable information about the POW camps in BƒÉl»õi, although they were kept secret before 1989. A study in 1992 on a sample of 800 POWs came up with only 13 survivors by 1953. In the wake of the 1944 Soviet offensive, thousands of people, including many intellectuals, fled to Romania. Like the other localities of Moldova, the city lost most of its pre-war intelligentsia as refugees. During the spring and summer of 1944, the frontline stabilized along a west‚Äìeast curve passing 40 km south of the city. After gathering enough forces for a breakthrough (about 1.3 million) and artillery (approximately 370 units per km of frontline) the Red Army penetrated the German-Romanian defenses (approximately 600,000 troops) in the Jassy-Kishinev Offensive, encircling and annihilating a large part of the opposing force. On 23 August 1944, after a royal coup, Romania switched sides and joined the Allies for the rest of the war. Following the successful offensive, Moldavians of suitable age in the recaptured territories were drafted en masse into the Soviet army, and were not released until 1946. = Post-World War II period = In 1944, with the return of the Soviet authorities, the policy of political and class persecution resumed, with people deported from northern Moldova to Siberia, the northern Urals, the Russian Far East, and Kazakhstan. The largest of the postwar deportations, \\"Operation South\\", occurred on 5‚Äì6 July 1949 and included 185 families from the city of BƒÉl»õi and 161 families from what were then suburbs. Approximately 12,000 Bessarabian families were rounded up and deported as part of this operation.

Many young people were also enrolled in labor camps throughout the Soviet Union. An anti-Soviet armed resistance group was active in the city during the Stalinist era. \\"Sabia DreptƒÉ≈£ii\\" (\\"The Sword of Justice\\") was discovered by the NKVD in 1947, based at the Pedagogical Lyc√©e (former Ion CreangƒÉ Lyc√©e) in BƒÉl≈£i.

Many buildings were leveled or damaged by bombardments and military action. Much of the population was killed, deported, sent to labor camps or ghettos, starved to death, or else fled and did not return. The losses affected all ethnic groups, while the interwar intelligentsia all but disappeared. During the 1940s and early 1950s, the city lost a significant part of its population to Stalinist repressions (political imprisonment and deportations), Romanian deportation of Jews (the Holocaust), war, the Soviet famine of 1946‚Äì1947, and emigration.Nikolai Bugai, –î–µ–ø–æ—Ä—Ç–∞—Ü–∏—è –Ω–∞—Ä–æ–¥–æ–≤ –∏–∑ –£–∫—Ä–∞–∏–Ω—ã, –ë–µ–ª–æ—Ä—É—Å—Å–∏–∏ –∏ –ú–æ–ª–¥–∞–≤–∏–∏ : –õ–∞–≥–µ—Ä—è, –ø—Ä–∏–Ω—É–¥–∏—Ç–µ–ª—å–Ω—ã–π —Ç—Ä—É–¥ –∏ –¥–µ–ø–æ—Ä—Ç–∞—Ü–∏—è (deportarea popoarelor din Ucraina, Bielorusia ≈üi Moldova: lagƒÉre, muncƒÉ silnicƒÉ ≈üi deportare), Dittmar Dahlmann et Gerhard Hirschfeld ‚Äì Essen, Germania, 1999, P. 567-581. After World War II, significant immigration occurred from all over the USSR in a move to rebuild Moldova, develop industry and establish a local Soviet and party apparatus. In the 1980s, many Moldovans from the northern countryside moved to BƒÉl≈£i. By the end of the 1980s, most of the Jews of Moldova had migrated to Israel. The Russian- and Ukrainian- speaking group had by then reached 50% of the population of the city, with Moldavian speakers representing the other 50%. During that time, the regional delegate to the Supreme Soviet of the Soviet Union was the Soviet marshal Sergei Akhromeyev ‚Äì one of the most pre-eminent hard-liners in the Soviet power system, and one of the close allies of the putchists that attempted to overthrow Soviet president Mikhail Gorbachev in 1991. In Soviet times, the city claimed several dozen nationalities, with Russian being the dominant public language. From 1940 to 1989, the population of the city increased 4-fold, with the addition of newcomers from all over the USSR, and also of local Moldovans moving from the countryside to the city. The city was further developed into a major industrial center, with the status of a city of republican subordination.  1989 to present  Moldovan postage stamp depicting poet and writer Mihai Eminescu. During 1988 and 1989 ‚Äì the most effervescent period in Moldova's recent history ‚Äì BƒÉl»õi was known as the \\"quiet city\\" of Moldova. Few public demonstrations took place in the city during this period, none gathering more than 15,000. Most citizens, including Moldovans, opposed the drive for establishing Romanian as the only official language of the country. All local elections were won by the old Soviet apparatus candidates. Municipal activity was conducted in both Russian and Moldovan. The city also actively supported Ukrainian language and culture, with approximately 25,000 citizens being Ukrainians. Following Moldova's declaration of independence in 1991, the rise of nationalist sentiments throughout the country and the economic crisis and unemployment caused by the collapse of the USSR resulted in massive emigration which, coupled with a low birth rate, led to a 23% decrease in the population of BƒÉl≈£i. Russians and Ukrainians were the most affected ethnic groups, losing 45% and 30% of their 1989 numbers respectively, with the Moldovan population decreasing by 15%. Many inhabitants of the city travelled for seasonal work in, and (less often) emigrated to, Europe, Russia, United States and Israel. Through all this, BƒÉl≈£i's tradition of transport-related handiwork was not lost; the city had a number of factories and repair shops for engines and automobiles. The horse's-head coat of arms, though, was replaced with a new one featuring two horses. The city of BƒÉl»õi entered into a partnership agreement with the French city of Lyons. In 1994, BƒÉl»õi gained the status of a municipality.

He rose to prominence during the national struggle against British control of Iran's oil industry. For decades, most Iranians had resented the Anglo-Iranian Oil Company (51% of which was under the control of the British government) for the perceived injustice of allocating most profits to the company and the British government, while only a very small proportion was given to Iran, despite the fact that the oil fields were on Iranian territory. Baghai made himself known as a fiery critic of the British and he allied himself with those of like mind, including Dr. Mohammad Mossadegh (a man who had risen to prominence as a fierce critic of Reza Shah, the despotic ruler of Iran from 1921‚Äì1941, and of the British control of the oil fields and that country's interference in Iran's internal affairs). He was different from many other nationalists in that he held very left-wing (albeit anti-communist) views. He was able to best articulate this when he formed the Toilers Party of the Iranian Nation, a left-wing, nationalistic and anti-communist party that included such notables as Khalil Maleki (an ex-member of the Tudeh Party who broke away from that group for its dependence on the Soviet Union). In 1949, the Toilers Party joined with Mossadegh and his liberal supporters in forming the National Front of Iran, which was an umbrella organization for all Iranians who were committed to the principles of freeing Iran from foreign domination, ending arbitrary rule and establishing a government dependent on the will of the people of Iran. In April 1951, one month after the oil industry was nationalized by the Majlis, Mossadegh was chosen by that elected body as the Prime Minister of Iran, subject to approval by the reigning Mohammad Reza Shah (who had succeeded his father as Shah of Iran in Sept. 1941). Until 1952, Baghai stood by Mossadegh in his struggle against the United Kingdom and his intensifying dispute in Iran with the pro-Shah elements, who had opposed Mossadegh's style of governing and his policies vis-a-vis the UK. From 1952 to 1953, Bagai served in the seventeenth Majlis, from which he initially used to support Mossadegh's government. But by late 1952, Baghai had become disillusioned with Mossadegh, pulling his Toilers Party out of the National Front and siding with the pro- Shah elements, who were present in the Majlis, military, press, royal court and other institutions. In taking this course, he split with Khalil Maleki, who remained loyal to Mossadegh and formed his own group called the Third Force. On Aug. 19 1953 (28 Mordad 1332 in the Iranian calendar) the CIA and MI6 sponsored a coup d'etat against Mossadegh which succeeded in toppling his government and restoring the absolute monarchy to Iran. Due to his role in bringing down Mossadegh, Baghai was forever shunned by the ex-premier's colleagues and the Iranian public (most of whom had remained sympathetic to Mossadegh and his role in fighting imperialism abroad and despotism at home).

It features two beautiful women named Zoe and Stacey, whose plans for fun on the beach is interrupted by deadly danger. The series is executive produced, written and created by Rick Draughon and directed by Mark Cole. Zoe (Danica Stewart) needs to escape her Texas hometown after her boyfriend goes more than a little psycho on her. She packs up her bathing suit, grabs her best friend and fellow college grad Stacey and heads to California to visit her wealthy cousin April. Staying in April's seaside mansion seems to like the dream vacation, especially after the girls meet April's hot boyfriend Christian and the dreamy local deputy, Will. the worse quickly though when Zoe starts receiving menacing text messages from her ex...and the locals reveal their ulterior motives. This show aired every Tuesday and Thursday at nbc.com. Cast Danica Stewart as Zoe: Hailing from Plano, Texas, budding jewelry designer Zoe is the girl we all knew in high school. You know, the beautiful, popular confident one with a heart of gold? When her boyfriend Sebastian started stalking her and even tried to kill her during their senior year of college - she just had to get out of Texas. Luckily, her favorite cousin April invited Zoe and her best friend Stacey to escape to her place in Pacific Shores, California for the summer. Tanee McCall as Stacey: Zoe's lifelong best friend is Stacey, and she's had her entire future mapped out since she was a little girl. Wicked smart and maybe a little uptight, Stacey had had to work hard for everything in life, and plans on working her way through law school, which she's set to start in the fall. Stacey is thrilled to be spending her last summer away from the real world in Pacific Shores with Zoe, even though she'll have to find a job to afford it. Kam Heskin as April: Ex-model and global business woman April has always thought of her cousin Zoe as more of a little sister than a cousin. Even though they spent every summer together as kids, April grew up worlds away, in the Fox family's sumptuous coastal mansion. Her world may seem fabulous on the outside, but April has endured a lot of hardship in life: her mother left when she was a baby, and her beloved father Gabriel died a few years ago, leaving her an orphan in charge of a billion dollar fortune. Charlie Koznick as Christian: Christian is a bit of a mystery man, and a hot one at that. He rode the waves into Pacific Shores a few summers ago, with little more than the clothes on his back and a surf board. Having enrolled in the oceanography program at the local college and made a good friend in Deputy Will Carpenter, Chris makes ends meet by working as a carpenter and handy man. He started doing odd jobs for April, and it wasn't long before they discovered they had a lot in common. But is April's cousin Zoe more Christian's speed? Ken Luckey as Will: Born and bred in Pacific Shores, easy-going Will grew up idolizing his father, the town Police Chief. Following his dad into the family business, Will had to work hard to prove himself worthy of becoming a police officer. Most people in town think his father is a hard ass, but Will's much more easygoing. Although he's done some dating amongst the locals, Will has yet to find the right woman for him, and is beginning to doubt if she'll ever come along.

In 1900, a Pleistocene mastodon skeleton was excavated approximately east of Reverie, Tennessee and southeast of Wilson, Arkansas. In 1957 the site was reported as destroyed. Drawing of a mastodon skeleton by Rembrandt Peale Mastodons are members of the prehistoric, extinct genus Mammut. They resemble modern elephants. Native to North America, they are said to have lived on the North American continent from almost 4 million years ago, in the Pliocene Epoch, until their eventual disappearance about 10,000 years ago. Discovery In 1900, archaeologist James K. Hampson documented the discovery of skeletal remains of a mastodon on Island No. 35 of the Mississippi River, Tipton County, Tennessee. The site of the prehistoric find is approximately east of Reverie, Tennessee and south of Blytheville, Arkansas. Femur fragment of the Island 35 Mastodon at Hampson Museum State Park. During heavy rain in June 1900, sand at the point bar of Island No. 35 had been washed away, exposing the mastodon skeleton in the sediment when the water retreated from the sandbar in July of the same year. John Pendleton, a resident of Island No. 35, notified his neighbor James K. Hampson about unusual bones he had found exposed by the retreating water at the head of the river island. Reportedly, Hampson visited the site of the find \\"2 or 3 weeks\\" after the prehistoric bones had been discovered. By the time of Hampson's arrival, many of the bones had been stolen and the skeleton had been considerably damaged by \\"curiosity seekers\\" and \\"ivory hunters\\". The remainder of the skeleton (\\"mainly parts of the hind leg and pelvis\\") were excavated by Hampson with the help of a pick to separate the mastodon bones from the gravel and pebbles in which they had been resting \\"cemented together by a clay\\". Although this find was initially believed to be the remains of a single animal, Morse and Morse subsequently reported that the site consisted of at least two separate mastodons. Several human artifacts were recovered in possible association with the skeletal remains. However, these materials lack direct provenance, and it is generally believed that the artifacts and skeletal remains do not represent Paleoindian/Paleoelephant interaction.Corgan, James X. and Emanuel Breitburg (1996): \\"Tennessee‚Äôs Prehistoric Vertebrates.\\" State of Tennessee Department of Environment and Conservation Division of Geology Bulletin 84, Nashville. Today In 1957 the site was reported as destroyed. The remaining mastodon bones are on display in the Hampson Museum State Park.

Treignac, designated one of the 'most beautiful villages of France', is a most typically French town retaining much of its medieval character, situated on the banks of the Vezere River on one of the pilgrimage routes to Santiago de Compostella, the burial place of St James the Apostle along the way known as the Via Lemovicensis and crosses the 13th-century bridge over the river. During the Hundred Years' War, it was pillaged by Rodrigo de Villandrando. Geography =Location= Treignac is a commune located in the Massif Central on the Plateau de Millevaches. The village is built between 400 and 500 meters above sea level, at the foot of the Massif des Mon√©di√®res, in the gorges of the V√©z√®re river, at the gates of the Parc naturel r√©gional de Millevaches en Limousin (Regional Natural Park of Millevaches in Limousin). The site is limited to the west by the Rocher des Folles and to the east by the Saut de la Virolle. =Hydrography= The waters of the V√©z√®re are retained upstream of the village by the Barrage de Treignac (dam), forming the lac des Bariousses (lake). The commune is also watered by a tributary of the V√©z√®re, the l'Alambre, and the stream called Ruisseau de la Cassi√®re, tributary of the Soudaine, itself tributary of the V√©z√®re. =Climate= Influenced by an Atlantic Oceanic climate, it gives rise to a very green natural vegetation. History Founded around 800 AD, its first Chateau or Castle was built around the year 1000 on an inaccessible rock outcrop on a loop of the Vezere and at the same time the city walls were commenced of which the Chabirande gate of the 13th century still survives although the ramparts were destroyed at the start of the 19th century. The Chateau was the stronghold of the lands of the Medieval dynasty the Vicomte de Comborn, who had as its first head the man known as Archambaud the butcher, as result of his cruel rule. At Treignac, on the high point now called Les √©glises, not far from the fountain of Saint M√©en, was the starting point of this settlement, the first houses were built around the churches of Saint-Martin, Saint-L√©obon and Saint-Jean, now disappeared. The Church of Saint Martin was attached to the monastery at Uzerche. During the High Middle Ages, there were two main places in the current territory of the commune of Treignac: Manzannes and Treignac. In Manzannes, a priory was established, dedicated to the Notre Dame, attached to the monastery of Ventadour (Order of Cluny). The current parish church is the Church of Our Lady built originally in the 13C in Romanesque style and formerly part of the Chateau it was originally known as Notre-Dame-de-la- Basse-Cour and later Notre-Dame-des-Bans, when rebuilt in 1471. The bell tower was built in 1602 and one door in the style of Louis XIII (1610-1643) remains. Treignac was a free city following three charters: 1205, 1284 and 1438. The city was governed by four consuls. The Fleyssac house was built in the 15th century against the ramparts and buttresses of the gate of Pradelle, it was sold to the Protestants in 1638, where they celebrated their worship for the following 50 years. The town has been sacked by armies more than once, most notably by Rodrigue de Villandrando during the Hundred Year War and later during the Wars of Religion in the 16th century. Although rebuilding had started during the Renaissance much of the town dates from the 17th, 18th and 19th centuries whilst also preserving its medieval charm. The beautifully preserved Market hall in the town was originally built in the 12th century, it was rebuilt in the 15th century after being destroyed over a loan between warring factions. The Chapel of the Penitents (Notre Dame de la Paix) was built by the 'Brotherhood of White Penitents' as a reaction against the influx of Protestants in the 17th century. Before the Revolution it was known as Treignac la Montagne but at the time of Convention or the French Revolutionary Government of 1792/95 it was renamed Treignac. In more modern times the Finot bridge was built in 1824 and the Bargy bridge in 1840. In the 1900s, new streets were opened. On 20 July 1904, the PO-Corr√®ze railway line from Seihac to Treignac was built in 1904 but closed in 1970. The economy of the region is in part supported by tourism. As former Mayor, Guy Merle explained to Andre de Saint-Rat, kayaking contests and championships are popular. On 27 May 2012 Thomas Chambard won a national kayaking championship here on the Vezere Population See also *Communes of the Corr√®ze department References Category:Communes of Corr√®ze Category:Limousin Category:Corr√®ze communes articles needing translation from French Wikipedia ","title":"Treignac"},{"id":"13612043","text":"Seodaejeon station, meaning \\"West Daejeon station\\", is on South Korea's high- speed KTX railway network, 161 km south of Yongsan Station.

Early life Francisco de Aguirre was the son of Hernando de la R√∫a and of Constanza de Meneses. He joined the army of Carlos I, participating in the Battle of Pavia and the assault on Rome in 1527. While in Rome as an Alf√©rez in 1517, he was charged with the protection of a convent and as a reward, the Pope allowed him to marry his cousin, Mar√≠a de Torres y Meneses, while the King appointed him Corregidor of Talavera de la Reina. He moved to Peru in 1536, with a large retinue that included slaves and servants. He was part of the relief expedition that saved Gonzalo Pizarro, who was under siege in Cochabamba, and between 1538 and 1539 he participated in the conquest of the province of Charcas, in present-day Bolivia, under the command of Diego de Rojas. In Chile When he heard that Pedro de Valdivia was on his way to conquer Chile in 1540, he moved his troops (composed of 15 horsemen and 10 foot soldiers) to Tarapac√°, where he waited for two months in order to join him. Aguirre quickly became a close confidant of Valdivia and achieved a premier place in the new colony, being named one of the Alcaldes of the first settlement of Santiago and being severely injured in the defense of the city on September 11, 1541, when local Indians led by Michimalonco destroyed it. =Lieutenant governor= On June 20, 1549, Aguirre was appointed lieutenant governor of the zone between the Atacama Desert and the Choapa River, charged with the reconstruction of La Serena, which had been destroyed by Indians from the north. He was chosen for this task since he had already demonstrated a strong hand in the war against the Indians and their resulting punishment. On August 29, 1549, Aguirre refounded the city, constructing a fort for its defense. He then led his troops out in persecution of the Indians. The north of Chile would remain free of danger from then on, although somewhat depopulated and deficient in labor. In 1552 the Lieutenant General of La Serena, Aguirre took possession of Tucum√°n, on the other side of the Andes, after disputing the claim of Juan N√∫√±ez de Prado, who did not recognize the authority of Valdivia. There, after a series of exploratory expeditions, he founded the city of Santiago del Estero del Nuevo Maestrazgo on July 25, 1553 (although some historians consider that its real foundation was in 1550). =Dispute with Villagra= When Valdivia died in the Battle of Tucapel, his will was opened and found to designate Aguirre in the absence of Jer√≥nimo de Alderete. When he received the news, he was in Tucum√°n, and Francisco de Villagra had already managed to be acknowledged as governor, due to the death of Alderete and the absence of Aguirre. Apprised of the situation by his friends in La Serena, he immediately returned there, where he was welcomed as Captain General and Governor of Chile. He communicated his arrival to the Cabildo (town council) of Santiago, letting it be known that the troops under his command were prepared to maintain his position, which was his by right of Valdivia's will. The Cabildo of Santiago, however, refused to acknowledge the declaration, disarming the contingent of troops under Aguirre's brother Hernando which had been sent to deliver it. The conflict was finally resolved when a petition was sent to the Audiencia in Lima, which determined that the council had to submit to the command for six months, after which the viceroy Andr√©s Hurtado de Mendoza, 3rd Marquis of Ca√±ete would designate a new governor. If the term expired, Villagra would be the governor, in command of the army of the south. Aguirre wanted to ignore the verdict, but his forces were too small to match Villagra's if there was a confrontation, so he accepted it bitterly. In 1557 the viceroy's son Garc√≠a Hurtado de Mendoza arrived as the newly designated governor. One of his first actions was to have Aguirre and Villagra arrested, despite their courteous behavior in front of him. Governor of Tucum√°n Aguirre's imprisonment in Peru was not appreciated by the King and his advisers, and in 1562 the Viceroy of Peru Diego L√≥pez de Z√∫√±iga appointed him as Governor of the province of Tucum√°n, who was at the point of being lost to a general uprising of the local population. In 1564, when the conquest of this region was at the point of being reversed, Aguirre returned it again to Spanish domination. During his mandate, a rebellion was fomented by Jer√≥nimo de Holgu√≠n, which concluded with the capture of Aguirre. Freed later, he was indicted by the ecclesiastical authority of Charcas for having made heretical statements. The constant turmoils of his administration motivated the viceroy to remove Aguirre from his post, naming in his place Jer√≥nimo Luis de Cabrera. In 1576, Aguirre returned to Chile and settled modestly in La Serena, where he was held in respect until his death in 1581.

Behind it is the Gazi Atik Ali Pasha Mosque. The Column of Constantine () is a Roman monumental column built for Roman emperor Constantine the Great to commemorate the dedication of Constantinople on 11 May 330 AD. Built c. 328 AD, it is the oldest Constantinian monument in Istanbul and stood in the centre of the Forum of Constantine. It occupies the second-highest hill of the seven hills of Constantine's Nova Roma, the erstwhile Byzantium, and was midway along the Mese odos, the ancient city's main thoroughfare. The column shaft itself is composed of very large porphyry column drums set on a white marble pedestal that is no longer visible. The column once supported a bronze statue of the emperor holding a spear and wearing a seven-point radiate crown, probably nude, and possibly holding an orb. Its appearance probably referred to the Colossus of Rhodes and to the Colossus of Nero in Rome; all resembled the solar deities Helios or Apollo. The statue and column capital fell down after some eight centuries, and were replaced with a cross, since removed, and the inscribed white marble masonry capital visible today. The column's top is 34.8 m above the present-day ground level. Estimates of the original height of the column, without the statue, vary between 37 and 40 m; the monument as a whole would have been nearly 50 m tall. It may have been the largest Roman honorific column of all, rivalled only by the later Column of Theodosius, now demolished. Constantine's Column was taller than Trajan's Column and the Column of Marcus Aurelius; its size approached or exceeded the height of the Colosseum (48 m) and the internal height of the Pantheon (43 m) in Rome. The Turkish name √áemberlita≈ü, from ' 'hooped' and ' 'stone', was applied after renovations by the Ottomans in c. 1515, who added iron reinforcing hoops to the shaft, and the name became a synecdoche for the local area: √áemberlita≈ü. Bronze reinforcements had first been added as early as 416. A fire in 1779 blackened the column, after which became known as the Burnt Pillar, and fires had earlier damaged the monument in the 5th and 6th centuries. The column is where Yeni√ßeriler Caddesi (\\"Street of the Janissaries\\") adjoins the Divan Yolu (\\"Road to the Divan\\"); these streets connect Sultanahmet Square with Beyazƒ±t Square and roughly follow the course of the old Mese odos. The Roman street led eastward to the Augustaion, the Hippodrome, Hagia Sophia, the Baths of Zeuxippus, and the Chalke Gate of the Great Palace. To the west the way led through the Forum of Theodosius to the Philadelphion and the walls of Constantinople. In Constantine's Forum itself the emperor built the original home of the Byzantine Senate. History Constantine as Apollo on top The column was dedicated on May 11, 330 AD, with a mix of Christian and pagan ceremonies. In Constantine's day the column was at the center of the Forum of Constantine (today known as √áemberlita≈ü Square), an oval forum situated outside the city walls in the vicinity of what may have been the west gate of Antoninia. On its erection, the column was 50 meters tall, constructed of several cylindrical porphyry blocks. The exact number of porphyry blocks is disputed, but common figures range from seven, up to as many as eleven. Mango, C. (1981) Constantine's Porphyry Column and the Chapel of St. Constantine, p. 104. These blocks were surmounted by a statue of Constantine in the figure of Apollo. The orb he carried was said to contain a fragment of the True Cross. At the foot of the column was a sanctuary which contained relics allegedly from the crosses of the two thieves who were crucified with Jesus Christ at Calvary, the baskets from the loaves and fishes miracle, an alabaster ointment jar belonging to Mary Magdalene and used by her for anointing the head and feet of Jesus,Clarke, Howard: The Gospel of Matthew and its Readers.

A strong gale in 1106 AD felled the statue and three of the upper cylinders of the column. Some years later, Byzantine emperor Manuel I Komnenos (reigned 1143-1180) placed a cross on top in place of the original statue and added a commemorative inscription that read \\"Faithful Manuel invigorated this holy work of art, which has been damaged by time\\". Bronze wreaths once covered the joints between the drums, but these were taken by the Latin Crusaders who plundered the city during the Fourth Crusade in 1204. The cross was removed by the Ottoman Turks after the fall of Constantinople in 1453. Earthquakes and a fire in 1779 destroyed the neighborhood surrounding the column, leaving it with black scorch marks and earning it the name 'Burnt Column' (or, as referred to by Gibbon, the \\"burned pillar\\"). The column was restored by Abd√ºlhamid I, who had the present masonry base added. The base was strengthened in 1779. The original platform of the column is 2.5 meters (about 8 feet) below ground. The Column of Constantine Present The Column of Constantine is one of the most important examples of Roman art in Istanbul. The column is 35 metres high. Restoration work has been under way since 1955. Cracks in the porphyry were filled and metal brackets renewed in 1972. Since 1985, the monuments of the historic areas of Istanbul, including the Column, have been listed as a UNESCO World Heritage Site.

As a professor at Columbia University he directed numerous dissertations of scholars who became major historians. Osgood was a leader of the \\"Imperial historians\\" who studied, and often praised, the inner workings of the British Empire in the 18th century. Biography Osgood was born in Maine, and attended Amherst College, from which he graduated in 1877, having studied under John W. Burgess. He received his Master's from Amherst in 1880, took graduate classes at Yale, and spent a year in Berlin, before returning to the United States to teach at Brooklyn High School and resume graduate studies at Columbia under Burgess, who had recently moved there. Osgood received his doctorate from Columbia in 1889. He had already published two well-received articles in the journal Political Science Quarterly, which Burgess had founded in 1886: \\"Scientific Socialism\\" (Dec. 1886), and \\"Scientific Anarchism\\" (Mar. 1889)‚Äîthe two articles were then put together as his doctoral dissertation. Osgood then went to London to study documents relating to colonial America in the archives of the British Museum and the Public Record Office. Returning to the United States once more, he served as an assistant to Burgess for six years, and immediately began teaching the course on \\"Political History of the Colonies and the American Revolution\\" in 1891. In 1896, Osgood was appointed professor, in which position he remained until his death. His son-in-law, Dixon Ryan Fox, was also a historian, as well as author of a biography of Osgood, Herbert Levi Osgood, an American scholar (1924). Additionally, his nephew Ernest Staples Osgood was a prominent historian of the American West. Scholarly work Osgood wrote extensively on colonial American history, and his work is characterized by frequent and detailed analysis of primary sources. His work is descriptive, aimed as a careful analysis of the source material for the consumption of other historians, with little narrative running through it. In this he contrasts with Edward Channing, who wrote more popularly accessible works, but based them more on a synthesis of secondary sources. Osgood was an admirer of Leopold von Ranke, and his style is sometimes compared with the latter's. Osgood's work was criticized, even during his own lifetime, of being cold and concentrating only on institutions and facts‚ÄîDixon Ryan Fox quoted him as responding to one such critic: \\"...but is it the function of an historian to make history interesting?\\"Dixon Ryan Fox, Herbert Levi Osgood, an American scholar (Columbia University Press, 1924), 115. Along with Charles McLean Andrews, George Louis Beer (who was Osgood's student at Columbia), and other Imperial School historians, he took a view of the colonial period that focused on its imperial ties with Great Britain, which he first set forth in an early article (\\"England and the Colonies\\") in Political Science Quarterly (Sept. 1887) in which he was critical of the partisanship that had characterized so many studies of that era, where the colonists had been portrayed as heroic and virtuous while the British were the forces of evil.Herbert L. Osgood, \\"England and the Colonies,\\" Political Science Quarterly, Vol. 2, no. 3 (Sept. 1887): 440-469 in JSTOR Osgood also contributed an early article on the topic in the Annual Report of the American Historical Association for the Year 1898,Herbert L. Osgood, \\"Study of American Colonial History,\\" Annual Report of the American Historical Association for the Year 1898 (1899): 61-76 in Internet Archive as well as in an article on early American history in the famous 11th edition of the Encyclop√¶dia Britannica.Herbert L. Osgood, \\"United States -- History,\\" Encyclop√¶dia Britannica, 11th ed. (1910-1911), Vol. 27, pp. 663-684 in Internet Archive With the help of students and some research leaves from Columbia, Osgood visited the archives in the various states and in Britain to examine the original documents. The first series that came from this work was the three-volume The American Colonies in the Seventeenth Century (1904-1907), which received favorable reviews in the academic literature. Osgood then spent years working on the four-volume sequel, The American Colonies in the Eighteenth Century, which he had all but finished at the time of his death‚Äîa chapter on slavery was yet to be written, as well as the final editing. Dixon Ryan Fox, his son-in-law, edited the manuscripts, and the set was published posthumously in 1924. Because he had spent much of the 1890s working in various state archives, Osgood was asked to participate in the American Historical Association's Public Archives Commission project in 1900 to survey the state of records and their preservation.Annual Report of the American Historical Association for the Year 1900, Vol. II: Report of the Public Archives Commission (1901) in Google Books Osgood handled the section on New York, and while the reports on the other state records were in some cases cursory, Osgood's report was thorough, ran in length to 184 pages, and was also separately published so that libraries in New York could acquire it more easily.Herbert L. Osgood, Report on the Archives and Public Records of the State of New York and of New York City (1901) in Internet Archive As a public service, Osgood also edited the eight-volume Minutes of the Common Council of the City of New York, 1675-1776 (1905), known as the \\"English records\\" to distinguish them from the earlier Dutch ones.Minutes of the Common Council of the City of New York, 1675-1776 (1905) in Google Books Even while working on these various projects, Osgood continued to teach and supervise doctoral dissertations at Columbia, and among his students were William Robert Shepherd, Charles Austin Beard, and Arthur Meier Schlesinger. Biographer Gwenda Morgan concludes: > Osgood brought a new sophistication to the study of colonial relations > posing the question from an institutional perspective, of how the Atlantic > was bridged. He was the first American historian to recognize the complexity > of imperial structures, the experimental character of the empire, and the > contradictions between theory and practice that gave rise, on both sides of > the Atlantic, to inconsistencies and misunderstandings.... It was American > factors rather than imperial influences that in his view shaped the > development of the colonies.

This type of motor spins its outer shell around its windings, much like motors found in ordinary CD-ROM computer drives. In fact, CD-ROM motors are frequently rewound into brushless outrunner motors for small park flyer aircraft. Parts to aid in converting CD-ROM motors to aircraft use are commercially available. Usually, outrunners have more poles, so they spin much slower than their inrunner counterparts with their more traditional layout (though still considerably faster than ferrite motors, when compared with motors that use neodymium magnets) while producing far more torque. This makes an outrunner an excellent choice for directly driving electric aircraft propellers since they eliminate the extra weight, complexity, inefficiency and noise of a gearbox. Some front loading direct-drive washing machines use an outrunner motor. Outrunner motors have quickly become popular and are now available in many sizes. They have also become popular in personal, electric transportation applications such as electric bikes and scooters due to their compact size and high efficiency. 240 sailplanes of eleven different types from seven manufacturers are equipped with the FES propulsion system from LZ Design d.o.o of Slovenia. The 22kW provides enough power for lighter 13.5-15m gliders to self-launch and allow heavier gliders with enough power to climb and then maintain height, so avoiding an unscheduled out-landing. Its synchronous permanent magnet motor has an electronically-controlled commutation system.  Stator and magnetic pole count  The stationary (stator) windings of an outrunner motor are excited by conventional DC brushless motor controllers. A direct current (switched on and off at high frequency for voltage modulation) is typically passed through three or more non-adjacent windings together, and the group so energized is alternated electronically based upon rotor position feedback. The number of permanent magnets in the rotor does not match the number of stator poles, however. This is to reduce cogging torque and create a sinusoidal back emf. The number of magnet poles divided by 2 gives the ratio of magnetic field frequency to motor rotation frequency. =Common stator pole/magnet pole configurations= N denotes number of stator \\"wire wound\\" poles, P denotes number of rotor \\"permanent magnet\\" poles. * 9N,12P - very common to many small outrunners.

History The monks of Charroux Abbey founded a priory in the 8th century which attracted a population of peasants, craftsmen and tradesmen who lived and prospered around its fortified walls. The welcoming of pilgrims for Compostelle through Rocamadour was a lasting source of profit. In 1308, the viscount of Turenne granted the village a right to high, medium and low jurisdiction, permitting it to govern the birth of lineages of prosecutors, lawyers and notaries. The enclosure soon became too small to contain the entire population, and faubourgs were created.

The term is in particular used for brushless motors to differentiate them from outrunners that have their rotor outside the stator. The vast majority of electric motors are inrunners.  Usage in drones and model aircraft  Compared to outrunner motors, inrunners tend to spin exceptionally fast, often as high as 11000 RPM per volt, far too fast for most aircraft propellers. However, inrunners lack torque. As a result, most inrunners are used in conjunction with a gearbox in both surface and aircraft models to reduce speed and increase torque In many cases the inrunner is \\"ironless\\" in that there is no iron stator core to magnetize. The wire is run inside the can and held in place by epoxy or other resin material. Because there is no magnetic iron core, ironless in runners have no \\"cogging\\", in that they spin freely with no magnetic interaction when power is disconnected. A well-designed ironless inrunner is extremely efficient. This is because there is virtually no iron magnetization loss and very little windage loss in the motor. However, due to the lack of a magnetic stator core, the ironless motor has very low torque but also higher Kv (a unit that is defined as RPM per volt) when compared to an iron core motor.

Since 1988 Scholl-Latour has been working as a free author publishing a great number of books, producing reports and appearing as speaker or \\"Expert\\" on various TV and Radio shows. In 1978 Scholl-Latour had contact with Ayatollah Khomeini, who was in exile in Paris at that time. He was one of the few privileged journalists who were allowed to travel with the revolutionary leader on the plane upon Khomeini's return to Iran. In 1985 Scholl-Latour became a member of the German-Arabian Association; since 2007 its chairman. Despite his old age, he continued writing and traveling the world. In 2008 he visited East-Timor, the only country on the planet he hadn't visited before. In the years after 9/11 he published at least one book annually, all of them bestsellers.

Shade sails use a flexible membrane tensioned between several anchor points. While generally installed permanently, they are cheap and easy to set up. They are usually provided above public gathering places such as seating areas and playgrounds in countries where strong sun radiation makes prolonged stays in the open sun unpleasant or dangerous due to sunburn and skin cancer risk. History Ancient Egyptians and later the Greeks and Romans used large pieces of fabric to provide shade. The Colosseum in Rome was shaded with large canvas \\"sails\\" pulled into place by Roman sailors. Modern shade sails came into wider use with the invention of a far more durable and relatively inexpensive fabric called shade cloth. Useful versions of shade cloth appeared in the early 1990s especially in Australia and South Africa. For most of the 1990s there was some confusion about what these new devices should be called however they are now most commonly called shade sails throughout Australia, South Africa and the U.S.A. Shade sails have yet to have a significant impact in Europe and South America . A number of Australian shade sail businesses export to other countries. Rapid growth in the \\"shade sail industry\\" has seen many new businesses and websites offering shade sails and shade structures. Current technology A shade covering play area Originally shade fabric, like all fabrics in the outdoors, suffered from UV degradation. UV inhibitors are now added during the manufacture of shade cloth and good shade cloth now generally comes with a multi-year UV degradation warranties. Shade cloth is a knitted fabric and this is an important factor in using it to design and manufacture shade sails. Shade fabrics are measured by their shade factor, which is the measure of how much a shade fabric absorbs or reflects invisible light (ultraviolet radiation). This is listed as a percentage out of 100, with a 100% shade factor indicating complete light blockage. Successful shade sail design uses the inherent \\"stretch\\" of the knitted fabric to create three- dimensional shapes. Fabrics other than shade cloth are used to make shade sails such as PVC, a more expensive alternative, or canvas variations. The low cost of shade cloth and its ability to breathe makes it a prime choice for \\"cool shade\\". Installation Modern purpose-made shade sails vary in shape, size and color and there is trend towards installing multiple sails, sometimes overlapping, thereby adding some form and style to its function. Shade sails are tensioned usually by means of either a stainless steel turnbuckle or a pulley system fixed at each corner of the sail. For permanently fixed sails, the turnbuckle provides the best means of fixing the canopy since it generally allows more tension to be applied. For sails that are used on an occasional basis, the pulley system is more practical since it can be set up and taken down in a couple of minutes. For domestic applications of shade sails it is recommended to install them with a quick release \\"snap hook\\" at each corner. This allows the sail shade to be quickly taken down in high wind conditions or during the winter season. Correct installation requires that adequate and quite considerable tension be applied to the sail to allow it to adopt its correct shape and prevent flapping in the wind. It is important to ensure that the mounting points are substantial and secure both to be able to accept the required initial tension and to absorb the loads created by wind gusts hitting the sail.

Within the Socialist Party discussions had emerged on issues like the affiliation of the Trade Union Congress (Burma) to the World Federation of Trade Unions. Under the leadership of Thakin Lwin, the TUC(B) had steered towards an openly communist line. In the May Day rally of 1950, TUC(B) demonstrators had carried large portraits of Karl Marx, Friedrich Engels, Vladimir Lenin, Joseph Stalin and Mao Zedong. Thakin Lwin had publicly declared that TUC(B) followed the 'communist party line', but denounced the White Flag Communist Party, Red Flag Communist Party and Josip Broz Tito as 'deviationists'.

The recordings were intended to replicate the sound of the original hits as closely as possible. The albums were recorded by a studio group comprising session musicians and singers who remained uncredited, although they included Tina Charles and Elton John before they became famous in their own right.  Creation of the series  Record producer Alan Crawford conceived the idea for Top of the Pops, having noted several UK labels such as Music for Pleasure pioneer the anonymous covers format during 1967 and 1968. Crawford's key idea was to create a continuous series of albums with the same title. The Pickwick label agreed to undertake Crawford's idea and the first volume was issued in mid-1968, containing versions of twelve hits including \\"Young Girl\\", \\"Jennifer Eccles\\", \\"Do You Know the Way to San Jose\\" and \\"I Can't Let Maggie Go\\". A second volume appeared later in the year and included versions of two Beatles songs. In 1969 new volumes began appearing at generally regular intervals, with a new LP released every six to eight weeks. Volume numbers were not stated on the record sleeves, each edition simply called Top of the Pops, the name derived from the un-trademarked BBC television show of that name, with which there was no direct connection. Background From 1968 to 1985, Hallmark Records released nearly 100 albums consisting of covers of Top 40 hits. According to session singer Tony Rivers, \\"In those days, more often than not, you had to do three songs in three hours then you were out of there!! Not much chance of getting good at it!\\". However, he also notes that \\"there was good and there was bad\\", and that the studio singers and musicians usually tried their best. Dave Thompson for AllMusic stated that \\"it becomes apparent that the trick is not to look upon the songs as straightforward attempts to copy the hit song, but as interpretations rendered in the style of the hit\\". Part soundalikes, part true covers, the series sold well, and two of the albums reached No. 1 in the UK Albums Chart. In 2002, Hallmark Records went back to the master tapes, re-issuing several of the original albums, and releasing compilations using the recordings, which have a following of their own. 1970s During the early 1970s, the Top of the Pops series enjoyed considerable success and buoyant sales. Budget albums were accepted into the main UK album charts for a few months in 1971, during which four Top of the Pops LPs charted, and two made No. 1. However, they were disqualified in early 1972 since their low price was perceived as giving them an unfair advantage in the market. The albums continued to be released at regular intervals throughout the 1970s, with the general theme and cover art largely unchanged throughout. The cover designs featured female models in period attire, some with the models in skimpy clothing such as miniskirts and bikinis. There were numerous similar album series in existence in the 1970s, put out by other labels. These include 12 Tops on the Stereo Gold Award record label, Hot Hits on the Music for Pleasure label, 16 Chart Hits on the Contour label, and Parade of Pops on the Windmill label (and, later, the Chevron label), plus several others. Some of these were also commercially successful.  Offshoot releases  In addition to the central series of Top of the Pops, Hallmark issued an annual round-up for each year starting in 1969 and ending in 1981, plus another in 1984 (which was recorded specially, the main series having been wound up by then). Pickwick also assembled tracks from Top of the Pops for several other spin-off album projects, including collections themed by particular artists (such as Top of the Poppers Sing & Play the Beatles' Golden Hits) and a series marketed at children, under the name Top of the Tots. The main albums also sold well in Europe, and in the early 1970s a short-lived series of special 'Europe Editions' were recorded and released, with different tracks to the contemporary UK albums. Reception In a retrospective AllMusic review of The Best of Top of the Pops '81, Dave Thompson felt that \\"of the three John Lennon songs wrapped up within, either \\"Imagine\\" or \\"Woman\\" could have given Roxy Music's version of \\"Jealous Guy\\" a run for its money in the brokenhearted sincerity stakes\\". Decline and legacy In the late 1970s the main studio band behind the recordings was dispersed, and both the group's leader Tony Rivers and the regular producer Bruce Baxter left the fold. As a result, from about 1978, Pickwick compiled the LPs from material recorded by external companies. The series ceased in 1982 with volume 91, though a one-off volume (92) was released in 1985. The end-of-year compilations have been released on CD, as have four of the original 92 sets. Pickwick have also issued a number of themed compilations made up from Top of the Pops recordings, with CDs such as Disco Fever, When They Was Fab, and Knowing Me, Knowing You, an Abba tribute album. In addition, most Top of the Pops albums have been released on iTunes in several countries, credited to the \\"Top of the Poppers\\".

Early life Harjono was born in Indonesia's second largest city, Surabaya, East Java. He was fortunate enough to obtain a standard of education denied to most of his peers, attending an elementary school for European children and then high school in Dutch-occupied Indonesia. When the Japanese invaded, he was sent to a Japanese medical school in Jakarta, but did not graduate.Sudarmanto (1996) Career with the Indonesian military Haryono was in Jakarta when Indonesia declared independence.Mutiara Sumber Widya (publisher)(1999) Like many Indonesian youths, Haryono joined other youths to fight the Dutch, then joined the TKR, the forerunner of the Indonesian Army. Due to his superior education, he was made a major. His command of Dutch, English and German meant he was in demand during negotiations between Indonesia and the colonial forces. On 1 September 1945, he was appointed head of the communication office in Jakarta.Bachtiar (1988) In 1946, he was made secretary to the Indonesian delegation in the negotiations with the Dutch and the British. In November 1949, he also served as the secretary of the disarming section of the defense commission at the Dutch-Indonesian Round Table Conference, at which the Dutch agreed to transfer sovereignty to Indonesia. He returned to the Netherlands in July 1950 as military attach√© to the Indonesian embassy in the Hague, then on his return to Indonesia in October 1954, he joined the Army General Staff as Army Quartermaster. From August 1962 to 1964 he was Army Inspector general, and in 1963 was also appointed head of the Strategic Materials Section of the Supreme Operational Command (KOTI). His final position, which he took up on 1 July 1964, was third deputy to Army chief of staff Lieutenant General Ahmad Yani. Death In the early hours of 1 October 1965, members of the Tjakrabirawa, calling themselves the 30 September Movement, broke into Haryono's home at Jalan Prambanan No. 8. His wife was woken by the group of men who told her that the general had been summoned by President Sukarno. Mrs Haryono returned to the bedroom locking the door behind her and told her husband what was happening. She told him not to go and to tell the guards to return at 8 am. However, Haryono was suspicious and switched off the lights telling his wife to move with their children to an adjoining room. The Tjakrabirawa then fired shots through the locked bedroom door and Haryono jumped to the floor. Hiding he waited for the first of the attackers who walked into the bedroom carrying a burning newspaper for light. Haryono tried to seize the soldier's gun, but failed and ran out of the door in confusion. He was shot down by a burst from a Sten gun, dragged through the garden, and his body thrown into one of the waiting trucks.Hughes, John (2002), The End of Sukarno ‚Äì A Coup that Misfired: A Purge that Ran Wild, Archipelago Press, His body was put in a truck and taken to Lubang Buaya, the rebel's base on the southern outskirts of Jakarta. There it was dropped into a disused well along with the bodies of the other murdered generals.Sekretariat Negara Republik Indonesia (1975) All the bodies were recovered on October 4 and the generals were given a state funeral. Haryono was buried with his colleagues at the Heroes Cemetery in Kalibata on 5 October. The same day, by order of President Sukarno, he was posthumously promoted and made a Hero of the Revolution.

Membership of statutory bodies and professional organisations Richter was a committee member of the then \\"Criminal Bar Association of Victoria\\", and the Victorian Bar Council from 1997 to 1999. Richter was President of the Victorian Council for Civil Liberties from 1994 to 1996. In addition to his business as a barrister, Richter was also a part-time Commissioner of the Law Reform Commission of Victoria from 1989 to 1992. He was appointed a silk on 26 November 1985. Notable cases In 1987, Richer acted for surgeon Ian McGoldrick who was indicted on 11 charges of procuring abortions contrary to the then sections 64 to 66 of the Victorian Crimes Act 1958. The case was dismissed at committal hearings, the presiding Justice following Justice Menhennitt's reasoning in 1969 matter of R v Davidson [1969] VR 667 at 670. In 1994, Richter successfully defended Victorian Police officer Cliff Lockwood in the Supreme Court of Victoria against charges that Lockwood allegedly murdered Walsh Street police shootings suspect Gary Abdallah in 1989. In 1996 Richter successfully defended John Elliott against charges that he allegedly illegally moved A$ 66.5 million from Elders IXL, to \\"Equiticorp Tasman Ltd\\", a shelf company Elliot was alleged to control... In 1998 Richter led the defense for now convicted \\"Hoddle Street Massacre\\" perpetrator Julian Knight. Richter continues to represent Knight during his parole hearings on a pro-bono basis.'QC helps Hoddle Street killer Julian Knight's freedom bid', News.com.au, 6 August 2012. In 2000 and 2003, Richter acted for then ATSIC chairman Geoff Clark. In 2002 Richter acted for Ray Williams in the HIH Insurance Royal Commission and the inter-related court cases.. In 2005, Richter successfully defended Melbourne underworld crime figure Mick Gatto against the charge of murdering suspected underworld hitman Andrew Veniamin. In 2009, Richter successfully defended Labor minister Theo Theophanous over rape charges.Rick Wallace and Victorian political reporter, 'Top silk to defend MP in sex case', The Australian, 22 October 2008. In the same year, Richter represented a high school teacher who pleaded guilty to committing sexual acts against a teenage girl. During the sentencing appeal, Richter argued that the victim was a \\"drama queen\\". The appeal was successful, with Richter's client being freed. In 2015, Richter represented an athletics coach to national champions, with extensive links to one of the country's elite Catholic schools, St Kevin's College, Melbourne Toorak, who was convicted of grooming a child under the age of 16. In 2016, Richter represented one of the conspirators behind the 2015 Anzac Day Terror Plot, with the conspirator sentenced to seven years imprisonment, for a crime that carries a maximum sentence of life imprisonment. Richter argued that his client's \\"rehabilitation is in the public interest\\". In 2017, Richter intervened in the case of Susan Neill-Fraser, who was convicted in 2010 of the murder of Bob Chappell, meeting with Tasmanian Premier Will Hodgman to call for an independent inquiry. In 2017, Richter was retained by Cardinal George Pell after Pell was charged by Victoria Police in relation to multiple allegations of historical child sexual abuse. At Pell's 2019 sentencing hearing, Richter said that the case was \\"no more than a plain vanilla sexual penetration case where the child is not actively participating\\". He later issued a written apology for making the statement. Bret Walker has replaced Richter as Pell's lead counsel for his subsequent appeal.

Biography  David Hull began his career in music performing with Buddy Miles, Joe Cocker, Ted Nugent, Arthur Lee & Lee's band (called \\"Band-Aid\\" on the Lee solo album Vindicator. In the 1970s, he was a member of the Connecticut band White Chocolate. Later, Hull founded the rock band The Dirty Angels and was a songwriter, bassist and co-producer on the band's three albums. On October 1, 1970, Hull performed at an impromptu show after the funeral of Jimi Hendrix. Hull joined Buddy Miles, Johnny Winter, Charlie Karp, Billy Cox, Mitch Mitchell and Noel Redding at a nearby hall. Since Hull's personal connection to members of Aerosmith date back to the late 1970s, Hull was asked to be the studio and touring bassist and background vocalist for the first two albums of The Joe Perry Project, a band formed by Aerosmith guitarist Joe Perry. Several songs on the band's first two albums were co-written by Hull. In 1986, he changed his name to David Heit and formed a rock trio with fellow Joe Perry Project member Charlie Farren, naming the band Farrenheit (also written as Farren/Heit). The band signed with Warner Bros. Records and their music went into regular rotation on MTV. They scored an opening slot on Boston's 70-stop sold-out American tour. Farrenheit's eponymous album spent seven weeks on the Billboard 200. After Farrenheit, Hull was involved with several bands including rock bands Modern Farmer (with Reeves Gabrels) and Pete Droge And The Sinners, in addition to blues band Kat in the Hat and with Monster Mike Welch. In 2006, Hull filled in on Aerosmith's Route of All Evil Tour for regular bassist Tom Hamilton who was absent while recovering from throat cancer. In 2009, after filling in for Hamilton again on another of Aerosmith's international tours, Hull reunited with The Joe Perry Project on the band's album Have Guitar, Will Travel. The re-formed band toured the United States in 2009 and 2010. In January 2010, they joined with M√∂tley Cr√ºe on their tour of Canada. In April they joined Bad Company for a tour of the United Kingdom, during which they performed shows at Wembley Arena and the 100 Club. In September 2010, Hull released a solo CD Soul In Motion, on which he performed guitar, bass and lead vocals. The album was produced by Brynn Arens, former leader of Minneapolis band Flipp. Guest musicians included Joe Perry, contributing lead guitar on the title song, and Charlie Farren on background vocals. In January 2013, Hull was involved in the album From Detroit to the Delta by the James Montgomery Band. He played bass, co-wrote three songs, produced, engineered and sang backing vocals. In April 2013, Hull was asked for a third time to fill in for Hamilton on Aerosmith's tour. David appears in the 2019 documentary film WBCN and the American Revolution.

It was designed by E. Lindsay Thompson and Spooner & Dixon. It is also known as Gallery and Shop. The property is owned by Property NSW, an agency of the Government of New South Wales. It is currently tenanted by the Julian Ashton Art School. It was added to the New South Wales State Heritage Register on 10 May 2002.  History  =Early land grant= Prior to the subdivision of the site, today's 117-119 George Street was part of the hospital precinct. The three buildings forming the hospital followed the western side of George Street, along with Principal and Assistant Surgeons' quarters. These were set back from the street alignment with fenced kitchen gardens visible in illustrations. Dalley was a convict who came to Australia in 1819 to serve a life sentence. Following the relocation of the Sydney Hospital from George Street he was granted a section of land. Within six years he had taken two adjoining parcels of land in The Rocks. The original allotment 9 of Section 84 of the Town of Sydney was granted to John Dalley on 20 August 1834. Part of Lot 10 which was to become 117-119 George Street, was granted but not registered in the General Register of Deeds on 20 May 1840. It was on Lot 10 that Dalley had built a five roomed house by . The retrospective granting of title was part of a more general problem in The Rocks where there were competing claims to ownership. A plan drawn two years later by John Russell shows clearly the extent of Dalley's granted land, being the two granted allotments 9 and 10. Buildings are present on both blocks, but with irregular outlines. It is possible that the building on Allotment 10 is earlier and straddles the surveyed grant. An interesting feature is that the rear of Allotment 9 is slightly indented and this was done to accommodate two small bluffs or outcrops of sandstone marked on the plan. This is the only accurate indication of the natural environment on the site. Dalley's career as a convict eventually turned landowner and businessman was a relatively common one in NSW. The only significant variation to it is that he was the father of William Bede Dalley, a very successful barrister who became one of the most prominent NSW parliamentarians in the 1870s and 1880s. Born in 1831, it is probable that the young Dalley grew up on the site. Occupancy for the second half of the nineteenth century is established through the Sands Directories; however, some allowance has had to be made for renumbering of the street. Initially 117‚Äì119 were numbered 119‚Äì121 George, the changeover to the present numbers taking place in 1880‚Äì1881. The 1865 Trigonometric Survey shows in simple outline two identical-sized buildings with the narrow alleyway leading to unevenly sized rear yards. Another large building fronts Nurses Walk. An annotated drawing on the same base map shows a sanitation line running down the alleyway from about the centre of No. 119 to join with a sewer line running southwards along George Street which discharges as the Queens Wharf Sewer. This sewer was present in 1857. The Percy Dove Plan of Sydney in 1880 shows the No. 119 marked as being as occupied by the British Flag Hotel adjoining the alleyway, and in No. 117 is O'Neil Outfitters. Johnson is the hotel's licensee. The alleyway leads to a yard behind No. 119, and No. 117 also has a small yard, with a clearly demarcated outbuilding. A substantial two-storey store occupies the back of the lot. Some years later in 1895 another plan identifies both buildings as being the Queensland Hotel. The rear arrangement is slightly different, with the alleyway continuing southwards in a kink to go around a probable building. The proportions of the yards are the same but there is now a brick structure in a slightly different position. In 1900 the land was resumed by the Minister for Public Works as part of the more general resumption of the Observatory Hill Lands. A map prepared for this legal process provides excellent detail of the lot. The outline of the lot appears to be based on existing surveys, but it clearly shows the rear of the lot as being part of a dedicated laneway, even though it appears to have been encroached upon. The right of way again deflects from the main lot boundaries and turns to the south at the blocked laneway. No further information is available on the nature of the building at the rear of No. 119. A photograph is believed to show a two-storey building at the rear of No. 117, with the small dunny on the ground floor being the rectangle visible in the 1900 plan, with a slightly angled fence attached to its corner. It is not even clear whether it is an entirely industrial structure. = Oil, coal, and grease supplier = John Fell & Co. was a Sydney supplier of oil, coal and grease for industrial purposes. They took over occupation of the site from 1902 based on Sands Directory information and appear to have occupied the entire site. The one reasonably clear image of the building during their occupation shows that the doorway entrances to both No. 117 and No. 119 are marked with the company name. The block occupied by John Fell & Co. was rectangular and measured 34'6 by 82'8 (about 10.5m by 25.2m). Given the signage and the elaborate door and window surrounds on the ground floor it is possible that John Fell and Co. undertook an upgrade or even reconstruction of the fa√ßade of the building to mark their occupation. This would be consistent with the decorative style of the building. In 1905 John Fell and Co, oil merchant is listed at 119 George Street, and two John Fells are listed as living at Kendall Street (suburb not specified) and at North Botany. If Kendall Street is an error for Kendall Lane it places one of the Fells living about from the office. The 1910 Sydney Trades Directory lists Fell under oil merchants. It also lists another 24 oil merchants. They were widely scattered but others had offices in Harrington Street, George Street North and Kent Street, suggesting that the Dawes Point peninsula was a sound commercial location to operate from, as it serviced a substantial maritime and industrial area. 117-119 George Street at this time comprised two separate styled fa√ßades incorporated into the same building. No. 117 is a plain fa√ßade with a single large door, by comparison No. 119 is very elaborate. Based on the building characteristics Fell and Co. appear to have renovated the building and its fa√ßade, but it is possible that the street- front buildings, or at least the main section, are a new construction. A survey of 1923 shows the property as consisting of a single building with the side blind alley. The rear of the lot and a laneway are marked as being completely covered by structures. From the survey it is clear that there is a minor encroachment beyond the front building line and that the northern side of the adjoining No. 121 is set back slightly from the allotment boundary. John Wilson Fell, listed as a \\"Gentleman\\" purchased the property from the Crown on 4 June 1931. This was unusual in this block of George Street, as most properties remained in the ownership of the Government and would continue to do so to the present. Based on evidence from the subsequent site development application they ceased trading at that address by 1948. =Women's League of Health= The present building on the site was constructed in 1956. The main occupant of No. 117‚Äì119 in its later years was the Women's League of Health, later more simply the League of Health. The property was bought by Dorothea (Thea) Margaret Hughes on 10 December 1954. By the end of their occupation in 1973 the building was commonly known as the League of Health Building. It is not clear whether Hughes bought it with her own capital or on behalf of the League of Health. The building that was constructed was a modern style dark red brick building with dark panels, probably stained timber. The development application papers lodged with Sydney City Council reveal that the development was not straightforward at all. Although the plans do not appear to have been retained, the development sequence is preserved in other council documents. D. M. Hughes lodged a development application with Sydney City Council on 1 July 1955, registered as DA 434/55. Her address was listed as c/- The Women's League of Health, 308 George Street, Sydney. The application described the current offices, recently vacated by John Fell and Co. The application sought to extend the building to the rear, and to alter the existing building. The extensions would be about 22'6 by 30'6 (approx. 6.8m by 9.3m) on each of two floors, presumably in addition to the ground floor. The cost of the work was estimated at ¬£9,000. In support of the application Hughes said \\"We hold classes in a special kind of physical training for women and for children and many of the classes are concerned with prenatal work to alleviate and decrease maternal mortality and morbidity\\". An inspection report by Council staff noted that about half of the ground floor was occupied by Howard Research, with the remainder of the ground floor and the upper floor unused. No objection arising, the development application was approved on 8 August 1955. Shortly after the approval of the development application, a second DA was submitted by Hughes in February 1956. This proposed \\"(t)o demolish front portion of building and rebuild a three storey addition for use as an extension to the approved use of rear portion for health exercises\\". The cost was to be about ¬£10,000. The architects were E. Lindsay Thompson, Spooner and Dixon, of 56 Hunter Street. There were no objections to the application and it was approved on 19 March 1956. The effect of the two applications was to demolish the existing two storey building from Fell's occupation and replace it with a completely new three-storey building. Footings from the Fell building, and possibly the earlier Dalley building survive as an informal basement level and have been incorporated into the construction, but everything above ground dates from 1956. The fa√ßade as built was entirely modern in form. Large metalframed windows provided light for each floor, separated by a possibly metal infill strip. The walls were constructed in mid-dark red brickwork. The stairwell and amenities on the southern side are highlighted with a strong vertical surround and smaller panel infill. In 1960 an application was made to the City Council on behalf of the League of Health to add external shades to the upper windows. The building initially had no awning but in 1973 Flame Opals applied for firstly a temporary awning and then a permanent metal awning. The Australian branch of the Women's League of Health was established by Thea Stanley Hughes, who had been a student of Bagot Smith's, Hughes was born in Britain in 1935 but came to Australia at the age of four. She returned to Britain and enrolled in one of Bagot Smith's classes where she was an \\"outstanding\\" student. Hughes's philosophical background was influenced by the idea of reincarnation, and possibly by exposure to anthroposophy. As a result, her objectives were focussed more on developing women's character through self-development rather than on exercise. She purposefully dropped \\"and Beauty\\" from the League's Australian title. The League proved to be popular in Australia with more than 250 classes given weekly. Hughes wound the League up abruptly without it having another president or leader in 1974, coinciding closely with the League's departure from 117 to 119 George Street. Bagot Smith's and Hughes' work and objectives with the League are characterised as \\"first wave feminism\\", being concerned with basic structural gender inequality. In both Britain and Australia the League sought to develop a role for women independent of their social place. Freedom of movement suggested freedom of action, and the development of clubs and classes provided alternative avenues for women to associate. Although not figuring prominently in Australia in comparison to, for example, the fight for equal pay and conditions, these social movements helped the process of providing alternatives to the existing structure of society, and introducing an agenda of social criticism that influenced later feminism. =Retail outlet for opals= 117-119 George Street was acquired by the Sydney Cove Redevelopment Authority on 27 April 1971. Flame Opals, a specialist retailer in opals, moved into 117-119 George Street in September 1973. Operated by Mr William (Bill) Cudlipp it was one of the first tourist oriented businesses in The Rocks and, according to Colonel Owen Magee (the Sydney Cove Redevelopment Authority's Executive Director of the time): \\"his business acumen allowing him to see the opportunities in what was then a grubby area, his near neighbours at that time being a row of derelict shops left that way by the BLF bans\\". Mr William Cudlipp remembers that when he moved in that there was a man making uniforms in the basement of the building. The only access to the basement was a trapdoor in the internal stair riser.W. Cudlipp, personal comment, 2007 Between 1973 and 1978 extensive ground floor renovations took place as part of the initial five-year lease to Flame Opals. The works proposed to be completed in 1978 were: * Erect new wooden display units; * Redesign and reposition existing display units; * Erect a new mezzanine area; * Create a new secure selling area at the rear. The mezzanine level raised the rear level of the ground floor by four steps. This had the incidental consequence of requiring the remnant walls of the basement to be raised by several courses of modern brick to support the floor. =Julian Ashton Art School tenancy= The Julian Ashton Art School is currently the long-term tenant of the top floor, but was formerly on both upper floors. It moved into its current location in 1977 from the former Geological and Mining Museum. It operates a large and smaller studio and an office and store room. The School's collection of works and plaster sculptures are housed in the building. In the thoroughly modern red brick fa√ßade of the building was altered to make it blend in better with its neighbours and the prevailing historical motif of The Rocks. This required the partial bricking-up of the front windows on the upper floors, leaving three symmetrically placed windows in each floor. The windows in the toilets backing from the stairwell remained. The front fa√ßade was rendered, with simple horizontal string courses providing a mock \\"between the wars\\" styling. A semi- circular pediment was raised above the southern end of the fa√ßade. The result is reasonably effective, as the expectation from a casual glance is that it is an older building with a make-over, rather than a modern one artificially aged. In 1987 a major refit was undertaken to the lower floor of 117-119 George Street. The work included: * Installing a new street awning to the frontage of the building; * Erecting a signboard; * Putting in door and window hardware. Additional works required included the installation of a new steel beam on the first floor. The Hogarth Gallery, which specialised in the sale and promotion of Aboriginal art was the last tenant of the central floor.  Description  Henry King showing members of the Society of Artists' 1907 Selection Committee, including Julian Ashton (far left) and Norman Lindsay (fifth from left) The Sydney Art School (also known as the Julian Ashton Art School), which Ashton established in 1890 as the \\"Academy Julian\\", has been an influential art school in Australia. Julian Ashton students have included William Dobell, John Olsen, Brett Whiteley and Nora Heysen. Howard Ashton's son, J. Richard Ashton, and his wife Wenda ran the School from 1960, when, among many gifted artists, Ian Chapman and Archibald Prize winner Francis Giacco attended, until 1977 when Phillip Ashton (Richard's son) became Principal, this being the time of Haydn Wilson, political cartoonist Bill Leak and artist Paul Newton. In 1988 the school was incorporated and Paul Delprat, Julian Ashton's great-grandson, himself an ex-student took over the running of the school, becoming the current Principal. In 1989 the school's antique casts and easels, which date back to 1890, were classified by the National Trust. The school's main campus is in The Rocks, Sydney, located opposite the Museum of Contemporary Art Australia at 117-119 George Street, The Rocks. The building is listed on the New South Wales State Heritage Register. ; Built By: 1800s. As at 17 May 2001, Archaeology Assessment Condition: Partly disturbed. Assessment Basis: 1830s building remnants. Archaeology Partly disturbed, although an archaeological resources may exist in basement.  Heritage listing  As at 5 November 2008, the present Julian Ashton Art School located at 117-119 George Street is significant at a state level as the headquarters of the Women's League of Health, the Australian offshoot of a parent British health and fitness movement. The League represents a \\"first wave feminist\\" movement aimed at empowering women through physical fitness and education, and strongly reflects the philosophies of the League's founder and sole leader in Australia, Thea Stanley Hughes. The built fabric has significance through its association with the League as its headquarters, and through its contribution to the streetscape. The large and well-lit spaces on the first and second floor were well-suited to holding classes of the League. The fa√ßade modified to blend-in with the historic surroundings represents one way of thinking of the professionals in heritage conservation of the 1980s, and provides evidence of an attempt of the authorities to act in line with this way of thinking. The building's fa√ßade has been modified to make it blend in to the range of buildings present along that section of George Street. As a result, it contributes to the significance of The Rocks Conservation Area and the George Street streetscape. The early occupation of the building by Flame Opals is part of the early history of the Government ownership of the building through the Sydney Cove Redevelopment Authority, and the transformation of The Rocks into a retail tourism precinct. The association of the site with John Dalley is locally significant in the context of The Rocks, where he is representative of successful emancipist entrepreneurs. There is a potential strong or special association of the site with feminist history in NSW, as a result of its association with the Women's League of Health. There is potential archaeological and structural evidence of earlier buildings and occupation on the site preserved in or near the basement area. The use of the building by the Women's League of Health is an unusual instance of a health or fitness group being directly associated with a single building. Julian Ashton Art School was listed on the New South Wales State Heritage Register on 10 May 2002 having satisfied the following criteria. The place is important in demonstrating the course, or pattern, of cultural or natural history in New South Wales. The building was important in the history of the Women's League of Health, an Australian variation of an extremely popular British physical health movement. The strength of the movement indicates that it met a particular need for both social activity and exercise, combined with health and pregnancy information. The League itself is a good example of \\"first wave feminism\\" within the Australian community. The exercise regimes are representative of a number of physical activity focussed formal groups and movements that developed in Australia during the Inter-war period and following WWII. The early occupation of the building by Flame Opals is part of the early history of the Government ownership of the building through the Sydney Cove Redevelopment Authority, and the transformation of The Rocks into a retail tourism precinct. The site has an association with, successively, the Convict Hospital, Hotels and Boarding houses and small scale businesses. These are representative of the pattern of occupation and development of The Rocks through the nineteenth and early 20th centuries. The place has a strong or special association with a person, or group of persons, of importance of cultural or natural history of New South Wales's history. The building is associated with the Women's League of Health, which is synonymous with Dorothea (Thea) Stanley Hughes, who brought the movement to Australia, established it here and ran it until she wound it up. Hughes is important for her role in the development and operation of the League as an example of an early fitness and health movement. This association is significant on State level. The association of the site with John Dalley is significant in the context of The Rocks, where he is representative of successful emancipist entrepreneurs. The site has an association with William Bede Dalley, as the place of his birth and clildhood. While it is likely that his later life and personality were influenced by his childhood experiences in The Rocks, there is no specific significant connection with the legal and political work for which he is regarded. The place is important in demonstrating aesthetic characteristics and/or a high degree of creative or technical achievement in New South Wales. The building's fa√ßade to George Street is locally interesting as an attempt of the authorities to convert a modernist, 1950s building to make it blend in with the adjacent fa√ßades of the historic pre-modernist buildings. The building, with its current fa√ßade and scale, contributes to the appreciation of this section of the George Street streetscape as a mosaic of late 19th- and early 20th-century architecture. The place has a strong or special association with a particular community or cultural group in New South Wales for social, cultural or spiritual reasons. There is a potential strong or special association of the site with feminist history in NSW, as a result of its association with the Women's League of Health. The building may also be of importance to any other groups with special interest in the Women's League of Health and its contributions to the development of Women's rights in NSW and Australia. The place has potential to yield information that will contribute to an understanding of the cultural or natural history of New South Wales. The site has the potential to contain archaeological evidence of previous occupations as far back as , when Dalley's building was constructed, through later 19th-century occupation of the site, and evidence of the foundations of the John Fell and Co. building. The site is unlikely to contain significant or substantial evidence of either indigenous (pre or post-1788) deposits or evidence relating to the Hospital precinct. The known and potential archaeological resource has the ability to clarify the history of the site's building construction sequence and to contribute to the documentation of patterns of life in The Rocks, and more generally in Sydney. The place possesses uncommon, rare or endangered aspects of the cultural or natural history of New South Wales. The original building was of a common form, represented by many examples throughout Sydney in commercial and industrial areas. Many of these retain greater integrity than this example. The modified fa√ßade however is interesting in the history of heritage conservation in The Rocks, as it presents relatively rare evidence of attempts to historicize modern buildings that are located in a sensitive historical environment. The use of the building by the Women's League of Health is an unusual instance of a health or fitness group being directly associated with a single building.

Main spelling variants are Cosslett and Coslet, though Corslet, Coslette and other spellings have been recorded.  Origin of the surname  The Oxford English Dictionary (OED) gives the following first definition of corslet / corselet: ‚ÄúA piece of defensive armour covering the body.‚Äù Secondary definitions include ‚Äúa soldier armed with a corselet‚Äù, ‚Äúa garment (usually tight-fitting) covering the body as distinct from the limbs‚Äù and, used in combination, as a ‚Äúcorslet- maker‚Äù or ‚Äúcorslet-man‚Äù, the latter meaning ‚Äúa soldier armed with a corslet.‚Äù The word is of French origins, and its etymology is given by the OED as ‚Äúdouble dim. of cors, or body.\\"See Oxford English Dictionary. 1989. Second Edition. Online version at www.dictionary.oed.com Not surprisingly given its etymology, the apparent first Corslet, and many of the Cosletts, Cossletts and Coslets who followed, were skilled iron workers. This first 'Corslet' came to Wales to work with iron.The discussion that follows is drawn from two main sources: Schubert, H.R. 1957. History of the British Iron and Steel Industry from c. 450 B.C. to A.D. 1775. London: Routledge and Kegan Paul; Donald, M.B. 1961. Elizabethan Monopolies: The History of the Company of Mineral and Battery Works, 1568-1604. Edinburgh: Oliver and Boyd The Company of Mineral and Battery Works (hereafter ‚Äúthe Company‚Äù) was one of two mining monopolies created by Queen Elizabeth I in the mid 1560s, the other being the Society of Mines Royal. The Company‚Äôs rights were based on a patent awarded to William Humfrey on 17 September 1565. On 28 May 1568, this patent was replaced by a ‚Äúpatent of incorporation,‚Äù making the Company an early joint stock company. The patent of incorporation provided the Company with monopoly rights to manufacture various products including, in particular, iron wire. Iron wire had many uses, perhaps none more important than the making of wool cards which were essential to Britain‚Äôs important wool industry. However, at this time, the methods for producing iron wire in England were traditional ones, inferior to methods that had been long been in use on the European Continent. The main technical barrier was a lack of knowledge about how to produce ‚ÄòOsmond iron,‚Äô a high-quality iron essential to producing fine, relatively thin and malleable iron wire. Humfrey was intent on introducing these ‚Äòmodern‚Äô techniques. Beginning in November 1566, in Tintern, a village along the River Wye in Monmouthshire, he oversaw the construction of England‚Äôs first wireworks operated by water power. What was now needed was a steady supply of high- quality iron from which the wire could be manufactured. In 1567, Humfrey succeeded in obtaining the services of an expert in the production of Osmond iron from the south-western part of Westphalia, in northern Germany. This expert arrived in Wales in 1567 and began working at a forge located in Rhyd- y-Gwern, a hamlet in the Glamorganshire part of the parish of Machen, about 20 miles southwest of the Tintern wireworks. The expert‚Äôs name was later provided in Humfrey‚Äôs letter of 24 August 1577: > 'one Corslett, a German born who at his coming over into this realm first > devised more commodius engines than ever before was known or used in > England‚Ä¶engines, tools and devices as were first used and invented by the > said Corslet, for the making and hoosing of Osmond iron‚Ä¶'Stringer, M. 1709. > Opera Mineralia Explicata.

I. Hil. 12. Q.25.(9). According to historian H.R. Schubert, the full name of this expert was Corslett Tinkhaus of Westphalia, Germany.As his source, Schubert, (p.298) states ‚ÄúEvidence of the origin of Corslet Tinkhaus kindly supplied by the archive of the Castle of Altena, in Westphalia.‚Äù  Distribution of the name  Wales (especially Glamorgan), England, United States, Canada, New Zealand, South Africa, Australia.

They produced a distinct soft musical style, combining Karen's contralto vocals with Richard's harmonizing, arranging and composition skills. During their 14-year career, the Carpenters recorded ten albums, along with numerous singles and several television specials. The siblings were born in New Haven, Connecticut, and moved to Downey, California, in 1963. Richard took piano lessons as a child, progressing to California State University, Long Beach, while Karen learned the drums. They first performed together as a duo in 1965 and formed the jazz- oriented Richard Carpenter Trio followed by the middle-of-the-road group Spectrum. Signing as Carpenters to A&M; Records in 1969, they achieved major success the following year with the hit singles \\"(They Long to Be) Close to You\\" and \\"We've Only Just Begun\\". Subsequently, the duo's brand of melodic pop produced a record-breaking run of hit recordings on the American Top 40 and Adult Contemporary charts, and they became leading sellers in the soft rock, easy listening and adult contemporary music genres. The Carpenters had three number-one singles and five number-two singles on the Billboard Hot 100 and fifteen number-one hits on the Adult Contemporary chart, in addition to twelve top-10 singles. They have sold more than 90 million records worldwide, making them one of the best-selling music artists of all time. The duo toured continually during the 1970s, which put them under increased strain; Richard took a year off in 1979 after he had become addicted to Quaalude, while Karen suffered from anorexia nervosa. Their career together ended in 1983 when Karen died from heart failure brought on by complications of anorexia. Extensive news coverage surrounding these circumstances increased public awareness of eating disorders. Though the Carpenters were criticized for their clean-cut and wholesome conservative image in the 1970s, their music has since been re- evaluated, attracting critical acclaim and continued commercial success. History =Pre-Carpenters=  Childhood  The Carpenter siblings were both born at Grace‚ÄìNew Haven Hospital (now called Yale‚ÄìNew Haven Hospital) in New Haven, Connecticut, to Harold Bertram (1908‚Äì1988) and Agnes Reuwer (n√©e Tatum, 1915‚Äì1996). Harold was born in Wuzhou, China, moving to Britain in 1917, and the US in 1921, while Agnes was born and grew up in Baltimore, Maryland. They married on April 9, 1935; their first child, Richard Lynn, was born on October 15, 1946, while Karen Anne followed on March 2, 1950. Richard was a quiet child who spent most of his time at home listening to Rachmaninoff, Tchaikovsky, Red Nichols and Spike Jones, and playing the piano. Karen was friendly and outgoing; she liked to play sports, including softball with the neighborhood kids, but still spent a lot of time listening to music. She enjoyed dancing and began ballet and tap classes aged four. Karen and Richard were close, and shared a common interest in music. In particular, they became fans of Les Paul and Mary Ford, whose music featured multiple overdubbed voices and instruments. Richard began piano lessons aged eight, but quickly grew frustrated with the formal direction of the lessons and quit after a year. He had begun to teach himself how to play by ear by 11, and resumed studying with a different teacher. He took a greater interest in playing this time, and would frequently practice at home. By age 14, he was interested in performing professionally, and started lessons at Yale School of Music. In June 1963, the Carpenter family moved to the Los Angeles suburb of Downey hoping that it would mean better musical opportunities for Richard. He was asked to be the organist for weddings and services at the local Methodist church; instead of playing traditional hymns, he would sometimes rearrange contemporary Beatles songs in a \\"church\\" style. In late 1964, Richard enrolled at California State College at Long Beach where he met future songwriting partner John Bettis, Wesley Jacobs, a friend who played the bass and tuba for the Richard Carpenter Trio, and choral director Frank Pooler, who co-wrote the Christmas standard \\"Merry Christmas Darling\\" in 1966. That same year, Karen enrolled at Downey High School, where she found she had a knack for playing the drums. She had initially tried playing the glockenspiel, but had been inspired by her friend Frankie Chavez, who had been drumming since he was three. She became enthusiastic about the drums, and began to learn complex pieces, such as Dave Brubeck's \\"Take Five\\". Chavez persuaded her parents to buy a Ludwig drum kit in late 1964, and she began lessons with local jazz players, including how to read concert music. She quickly replaced the entry- level kit with a large Ludwig set that was a similar set-up to Brubeck's drummer, Joe Morello. Richard and Karen gave their first public performance together in 1965, as part of the pit band for a local production of Guys and Dolls.  The Richard Carpenter Trio and Spectrum  The Richard Carpenter Trio in 1967, featuring Karen, Wes Jacobs and Richard By 1965, Karen had been practicing the drums for a year, and Richard was refining his piano techniques under Pooler's tuition. Late that year, Richard teamed up with Jacobs, who played tuba and stand-up bass. With Karen drumming, the three formed the jazz- oriented Richard Carpenter Trio. Richard led the band and wrote all the arrangements, and they began to rehearse daily. He bought a tape recorder, and began to make recordings of the group. Originally, neither Karen nor Richard sang; Richard's friend Dan Friberg occasionally filled in on trumpet, along with guest vocalist Margaret Shanor. Karen subsequently became more confident in singing, and began to take lessons with Frank Pooler. He taught her a mixture of classical and pop singing, but realised she most enjoyed performing Richard's new material. Pooler later said, \\"Karen was a born pop singer\\". In early 1966, Karen tagged along at a late-night session in the garage studio of Los Angeles bassist Joe Osborn, and joined future Carpenters collaborator and lyricist John Bettis at a demo session where Richard was to accompany Friberg. Asked to sing, she performed for Osborn, who was immediately impressed with her vocal abilities. He signed Karen to his label, Magic Lamp Records, and Richard to his publishing arm, Lightup Music. The label put out a single featuring two of Richard's compositions, \\"Looking for Love\\" and \\"I'll Be Yours\\". As well as Karen's vocals, the track was backed by the Richard Carpenter Trio. The single was not a commercial success, due to a lack of promotion and the label folded the next year. In mid-1966, the Richard Carpenter Trio entered the Hollywood Bowl annual Battle of the Bands competition. They played an instrumental version of \\"The Girl from Ipanema\\" and their own piece, \\"Iced Tea\\". They won the competition on June 24 and were signed by RCA Records. They recorded songs such as the Beatles' \\"Every Little Thing\\" and Frank Sinatra's \\"Strangers in the Night\\". A committee reviewed their recordings and chose not to produce them, so the trio were released from RCA. Karen graduated from high school in early 1967, and was awarded the John Philip Sousa Band award. She subsequently joined Richard at Long Beach State as a music major. Osborn let Karen and Richard continue to use his studio to record demo tapes. As they had unlimited studio time, Richard decided to experiment with overdubbing his and Karen's voices in order to create a large choral sound. In 1967, Jacobs left to study classical music and join the Detroit Symphony Orchestra, and the Richard Carpenter Trio disbanded. Richard and Bettis then were hired as musicians at a refreshment shop at Disneyland's Main Street, U.S.A.. They were expected to play turn of the 20th century songs in keeping with the shop's theme. The shop's patrons had other ideas; many requested the musicians to play current popular music. When the pair tried pleasing their customers and honoring the requests, they were fired by a Disneyland supervisor, Victor Guder, for being \\"too radical\\". Bettis and Richard were unhappy about their dismissal and wrote the song \\"Mr. Guder\\" about their former superior. Richard and Karen then teamed up with student musicians from Long Beach State to form the band Spectrum. The group included Bettis on guitar, who began writing lyrics to Richard's songs, guitarist Gary Sims, bassist Dan Woodhams, and vocalist Leslie \\"Toots\\" Johnston. The group sent demos to various record labels around Los Angeles, with little success. Part of the problem was the group's middle-of-the-road sound, which was different to the psychedelic rock popular in clubs. Richard's friend Ed Sulzer managed to book time at United Audio Recording Studio in Santa Ana, and the group recorded several original songs including \\"Candy\\" (which became \\"One Love\\" on the Carpenters' self-titled 1971 album). Richard bought a Wurlitzer electric piano as an additional instrument to complement his acoustic piano onstage. Spectrum performed regularly at the Whisky a Go Go nightclub in Los Angeles, including opening for Steppenwolf early in that group's career. By 1968, Spectrum had disbanded, finding it difficult to get gigs as their music was not considered \\"danceable\\" by rock and roll standards. Having enjoyed their multi-layer sound experiments at Osborn's studio, Richard and Karen decided to formally become a duo, calling themselves Carpenters. Later in the year, the duo received an offer to be on the television program Your All American College Show. Their performance on the program, playing a cover of \\"Dancing in the Street\\", was their first television appearance, with new bassist Bill Sissoyev. The program had a weekly winner with all weekly winners competing in semi-finals and finals at the end of 12 weeks. The finals featuring \\"The Dick Carpenter Trio\\" aired on August 31, 1968. Karen also auditioned as a vocalist in Kenny Rogers and The First Edition, but was unsuccessful. By this time, Sulzer had become the group's manager, while the duo continued to record demos with Osborn, one of which was sent to A&M; Records via a friend of Sulzer's. At the same time, the duo were asked to audition for a Ford Motor Company advertising campaign, which included $50,000 each and a brand new Ford automobile. The group accepted the offer, but quickly withdrew it after receiving a formal offer from A&M.; Label owner Herb Alpert was intrigued by Karen's voice, later saying \\"It touched me ... I felt like it was time\\". On meeting the duo, Alpert said \\"Let's hope we can have some hits!\\" =As the Carpenters=  Offering (Ticket to Ride)  Richard and Karen Carpenter signed to A&M; Records on April 22, 1969. Since Karen was 19 and underage, her parents had to co-sign. The duo had decided to sign as \\"Carpenters\\", without the definite article, which was influenced by names such as Buffalo Springfield or Jefferson Airplane, which they considered \\"hip\\". When the Carpenters signed to A&M; Records, they were given free rein in the studio to create an album in their own style. The label recommended that Jack Daugherty should produce it, though those present have since suggested that Richard was the de facto producer. Most of the album's material had already been written for and performed with Spectrum; \\"Your Wonderful Parade\\" and \\"All I Can Do\\" both came from demos recorded with Osborn. Richard rearranged the Beatles' \\"Ticket to Ride\\" in a melancholic ballad style. Osborn played bass on the album (and remained their regular studio bassist throughout their career). Karen also played bass on \\"All of My Life\\" and \\"Eve\\", after being taught the relevant parts by Osborn. The album, entitled Offering, was released on October 9, 1969, to a positive critical reception; one review in Billboard said \\"With radio programming support, Carpenters should have a big hit on their hands.\\" \\"Ticket to Ride\\" was released as a single on November 5, and became a minor hit for the Carpenters, peaking at No. 54 on the Billboard Hot 100 and the Top 20 of the Adult Contemporary chart. The album only sold 18,000 copies on its initial run, at a loss for A&M;, but after the Carpenters' subsequent breakthrough the album was repackaged and reissued internationally under the name Ticket to Ride and sold 250,000 copies.  Close to You  Karen drumming on stage Despite the poor showing of Offering, A&M; retained the Carpenters and decided they should record a hit single instead. In December 1969, they met Burt Bacharach, who was impressed by their work and invited the duo to open for him at a charity concert, which should include them performing a medley of Bacharach / Hal David songs. Herb Alpert asked Richard to re-work a Bacharach/David song \\"(They Long to Be) Close to You\\", which had first been recorded in 1963 by Richard Chamberlain, and Dionne Warwick the following year. Richard Carpenter decided the song would work as a standalone piece, and wrote an arrangement from scratch without being influenced by any earlier recordings. The duo struggled on an early recording attempt, and for the second session, Alpert suggested that seasoned session player Hal Blaine play drums instead of Karen. Larry Knechtel was tried out as a session pianist, but was replaced by Richard for the final take. The Carpenters' version was released as a single in March 1970. It entered the charts at No. 56, the highest debut of the week ending June 20. It reached No. 1 on July 25 and stayed there for the next four weeks. Their next hit was a song Richard had seen in a television commercial for Crocker National Bank, \\"We've Only Just Begun\\", written by Paul Williams and Roger Nichols. Three months after \\"Close to You\\" reached No. 1, the Carpenters' version of \\"We've Only Just Begun\\" reached No. 2 on the Billboard Hot 100, becoming the first of their eventual five No. 2 hits (it was unable to get past \\"I'll Be There\\" by The Jackson 5 and \\"I Think I Love You\\" by The Partridge Family during its four-week stay). The song became the first hit single for Williams and Nichols, who think the Carpenters' version is definitive. \\"Close to You\\" and \\"We've Only Just Begun\\" became RIAA certified gold singles and were featured on the best-selling album Close to You, which placed No. 175 on Rolling Stones 500 Greatest Albums of All Time list in 2003. The album also included \\"Mr. Guder\\", the song inspired by Disneyland supervisor Victor Guder, who had dismissed the young songwriters for playing popular music when they worked at the park. The Carpenters began touring, attempting to recruit Jacobs and former Spectrum members. Jacobs decided to continue with the Detroit Symphony, but Woodhams and Sims agreed to be part of the live band, which was completed with Doug Strawn and Bob Messenger. They rehearsed daily on the A&M; soundstage in order to present a concert show that could compare with their records. As a result of their chart success, the group made several television appearances in 1970, including The Ed Sullivan Show. The Carpenters also chose Sherwin Bash as their new manager around this time. On Thanksgiving Day, 1970, the Carpenter family moved into a new $300,000 ($ as of ) home near the San Gabriel River. The duo rounded out the year with the holiday release of \\"Merry Christmas, Darling\\", which they had been playing for several years. The single scored high on the holiday charts and would repeatedly return to the holiday charts in subsequent years. In 1978, Karen re-cut the vocal for their Christmas TV special, feeling she could give a more mature treatment to it; this remake also became a hit.  Carpenters and A Song for You  The Carpenters logo, originally designed for their eponymous album The Carpenters had a string of hit singles and albums through the early 1970s. Their 1971 song \\"For All We Know\\" was recorded the previous year by members of the pop group Bread for a wedding scene in the movie Lovers and Other Strangers. Richard saw the song's potential for the Carpenters and recorded it in the autumn of 1970. The track became the duo's third gold single, and later won an Oscar for \\"Best Original Song\\". On March 16, 1971, the duo received Grammy Award nominations for Best New Artist and Best Contemporary Performance by a Duo, Group or Chorus. Karen and Richard Carpenter at the White House, August 1, 1972 The duo's fourth gold single, \\"Rainy Days and Mondays\\", became Williams' and Nichols' second major single with the Carpenters. The demo was written by Williams about his mother, which led to the line, \\"Talking to myself and feeling old\\". Richard rearranged the song to include a saxophone solo, played by Bob Messenger. The single peaked at No. 2 on the Billboard Hot 100, kept from the top slot by Carole King's \\"It's Too Late\\". \\"Superstar\\", written by Bonnie Bramlett and Leon Russell, became the duo's next hit. The song had originally appeared on Joe Cocker's 1970 album Mad Dogs & Englishmen, sung by Rita Coolidge. Karen was familiar with the album, but Richard first heard the song when it was covered by Bette Midler on The Tonight Show, and realised its potential as a Carpenters hit. The duo changed the line \\"I can hardly wait to sleep with you again\\" to \\"... to be with you again\\", as they knew the former would not be played on Top 40 radio. The single sold a million copies, attaining gold status, and became the Carpenters' third No. 2 single on the Billboard Hot 100 (this time held off the top spot by Rod Stewart's \\"Maggie May\\" / \\"Reason to Believe\\"). On May 14, 1971, the Carpenters performed a sell-out show at Carnegie Hall, and they released their third album, Carpenters the same day. It became one of their best sellers, earning RIAA certification for platinum four times, and rising to No. 2 on Billboards pop album chart for two weeks (behind Carole King's Tapestry) with over a million pre-sales orders. The album won a Grammy Award, as well as receiving three nominations. The A&M; graphics department hired Craig Braun and Associates to design the cover. \\"I recognized it to be a great logo as soon as I saw it\\", says Richard. The logo was used on every Carpenters album thereafter; Richard said it was done \\"to keep things consistent\\". The logo did not appear on the front cover of Passage but a small version appeared on the back cover. Shortly after the third album, the duo recorded a short television series, Make Your Own Kind of Music, which drew mixed reviews. By mid-1971, the Carpenters were being criticized that their live shows had no focal point, as Karen was seated behind the drums. Richard and Bash tried to persuade her to sing out-front. Karen resisted at first, but was eventually persuaded to front the popular numbers and ballads, and drum for more up-tempo numbers. Consequently, Jim Anthony was hired as a touring drummer. Over time, Karen became more relaxed as a frontwoman and centerpiece of the band. Later that year, Richard was watching a Bing Crosby movie, Rhythm on the River, in which Crosby played a country singer whose career was in decline and whose most famous song was \\"Goodbye to Love\\". The song was never performed in the film, so Richard imagined what it might sound like and wrote down some initial lyrics. These were finished off by Bettis, and became \\"Goodbye to Love\\". For the arrangement, Richard suggested adding a fuzz guitar solo. He resisted suggestions to get an experienced session player in, and instead asked Tony Peluso, whose band Instant Joy had supported the Carpenters on an earlier tour. Peluso was a typical rock guitarist and did not read music, so Richard wrote out a chord chart for him to follow. Having been instructed to play the first five bars of the melody and then improvise, he recorded the solo in two takes. Bettis later described \\"Goodbye to Love\\" as his favorite single he has worked on in his career. The single reached No. 7 in the Billboard Hot 100, and Peluso accepted an offer to tour with the Carpenters full-time. Some did not appreciate the combination of a soft ballad and loud electric guitar, and sent hate mail to the Carpenters, but conversely they picked up new fans who appreciated the bridge between rock and pop. On April 25, 1972, the Carpenters visited the White House to meet presidential assistants James Cavanagh, Ken Cole and Ronald Zeigler. They returned on August 1 to meet President Richard Nixon and posed for photographs with him at the Oval Office. \\"Goodbye to Love\\" was featured on the Carpenters' fourth album, A Song for You released on June 13, 1972. The title track, a cover of a song on Leon Russell's debut album, was considered as a single, but rejected owing to its length. The album also included a Carole King song, \\"It's Going To Take Some Time\\" and another Nichols / Williams original, \\"I Won't Last A Day Without You\\". Another Carpenter / Bettis composition, \\"Top of the World\\", was originally intended as just an album cut, but after Lynn Anderson scored a hit with the song in early 1973, the Carpenters opted to record their own single version. It was released in September and became the Carpenters' second Billboard No. 1 hit, in December.  Now & Then  Richard in 1973 The Carpenters met the President again on April 30, 1973, when they performed a special concert at the White House, though the event was overshadowed by the resignation of the White House Chief of Staff, Bob Haldeman, and assistant John Ehrlichman over the Watergate scandal, which would ultimately also lead to Nixon's resignation. Their next album, Now & Then, was named by the duo's mother, Agnes. It contained Sesame Street's signature song \\"Sing\\", featuring the Jimmy Joice Children's Choir, which was released as a single, reaching No. 3 on the Hot 100. The album also included a Leon Russell composition, \\"This Masquerade\\", and the ambitious \\"Yesterday Once More\\", a side-long tribute to oldies radio which incorporated renditions of eight hit songs from previous decades into a faux oldies radio program. The single version of the latter became their biggest hit in the United Kingdom, holding the No. 2 spot for two weeks, and became the Carpenters' biggest worldwide hit. In 1974, the Carpenters achieved a significant international hit with an up-tempo remake of Hank Williams's \\"Jambalaya (On the Bayou)\\". While the song was not released as a single in the US, it reached the top 30 in Japan, No. 12 in the United Kingdom (as part of a double A-side with \\"Mr. Guder\\"), and No. 3 in the Netherlands. At Christmas that year, the duo released a jazz-influenced rendition of \\"Santa Claus Is Coming to Town\\" and appeared on Perry Como's Christmas show.  The Singles: 1969‚Äì1973  Karen in 1973 The Carpenters did not record a new album in 1974. They had been touring extensively and were exhausted; Richard later said, \\"there was simply no time to make one. Nor was I in the mood.\\" Tensions had erupted in the family unit; Richard had started dating the group's hairdresser but neither Agnes nor Karen took kindly to her and she ultimately ended the relationship and quit the band's services. Agnes had always praised Richard's musical talents, which Karen resented. The duo ultimately moved out of their parents' house; at first the siblings shared a home. In May, the Carpenters undertook their first tour of Japan, playing to 85,000 fans. They later likened the scenes when they first touched down at Tokyo Airport to Beatlemania. During this period, the pair released just one single, \\"I Won't Last a Day Without You\\" from A Song for You. The Carpenters finally decided to release their original two years after its original album release and some months after Maureen McGovern's 1973 cover. In March 1974, the single version became the fifth and final selection from the album to chart in the Top 20, reaching No. 11 on the Hot 100 in May. In place of a new album, their first greatest hits package was released, featuring remixes of their singles, and newly recorded leads and bridges that allowed each side of the album to play through with no breaks. Richard later regretted this decision. This compilation was entitled The Singles: 1969‚Äì1973, and topped the charts in the US for one week, on January 5, 1974. It also topped the UK chart for 17 weeks (non-consecutive) and became one of the best-selling albums of the decade, ultimately selling more than seven million copies in the US alone.  Horizon  In 1975, the Carpenters had a hit with a remake of the Marvelettes' chart-topping 1961 single, \\"Please Mr. Postman\\". The song topped the Billboard Hot 100 in January and became the duo's third and final No. 1 pop single. It also earned Karen and Richard their record-setting twelfth million-selling gold single in the US. The follow-up, a Carpenter / Bettis composition \\"Only Yesterday\\", was the duo's last Hot 100 top 10 hit, reaching No. 4. The sound on the track was intended to emulate Phil Spector's famous Wall of Sound production technique. Both singles appeared on their 1975 LP Horizon, which also included covers of the Eagles' \\"Desperado\\" and Neil Sedaka's \\"Solitaire\\", which became a moderate hit later that year. Horizon was certified gold after two weeks, but missed the top ten in the US, peaking at No. 13\\\\. The album still had a positive critical reception. The Carpenters toured with Sedaka during 1975, but critics found the latter's performances to be more professional and entertaining. Richard became particularly cross at how Sedaka was getting more attention, and ultimately fired him from the tour. Karen struggled to cope with the demands of live shows, and a planned tour of the UK and Japan was cancelled. The duo begun to produce music videos to promote their records; in early 1975, they filmed a performance of \\"Please Mr. Postman\\" at Disneyland and \\"Only Yesterday\\" at the Huntington Gardens.  A Kind of Hush and Passage  Their next album, A Kind of Hush, was released on June 11, 1976, and was certified gold. However, it was the first Carpenters' album not to become platinum-certified since Ticket to Ride seven years earlier. The duo had several hits that year, but by this time the public had become over-familiar with them, and sales fell. Their biggest single that year was a cover of Herman's Hermits' \\"There's a Kind of Hush (All Over the World)\\", which peaked at No. 12 on the Billboard Hot 100. \\"I Need to Be in Love\\" (Karen's favorite song by the Carpenters) charted at No. 25 on the Billboard Hot 100. However, it followed \\"There's a Kind of Hush\\" to the top spot on the Adult Contemporary charts and became the duo's 14th No. 1 Adult Contemporary hit, more than any other act in the history of the chart. The Carpenters' Very First Television Special aired on December 8, 1976 and included guests John Denver and Victor Borge. It was the duo's first headlining television variety show in the US. A follow-up special, The Carpenters at Christmas, aired on December 9, 1977, featuring Kristy McNichol. The 1977 album, Passage, marked an attempt to venture into other musical genres. It featured an unlikely mix of jazz fusion (\\"B'wana She No Home\\"), calypso (\\"Man Smart, Woman Smarter\\"), and orchestrated balladry (\\"I Just Fall in Love Again\\", \\"Two Sides\\"), and included the hits, \\"All You Get from Love Is a Love Song\\" and \\"Calling Occupants of Interplanetary Craft\\". \\"Calling Occupants\\" was supported with the TV special Space Encounters, which aired May 17, 1978, with guest stars Suzanne Somers and John Davidson. Although the single release of \\"Calling Occupants\\" became a significant Top 10 hit in the UK and reached No. 1 in Ireland, it only peaked at number 32 on the Hot 100, and for the first time a Carpenters album did not reach the gold threshold of 500,000 copies shipped in the US. In early 1978, they had a surprise Top 10 country hit with the up-tempo, fiddle-sweetened \\"Sweet, Sweet Smile\\", written by country-pop singer Juice Newton and her long-time musical partner Otha Young.  The Singles: 1974‚Äì1978  In place of a new album for 1978, a second compilation, The Singles: 1974‚Äì1978, was released in the UK where it reached No. 2 in the charts. In the US, their first Christmas album, Christmas Portrait, became a seasonal favorite, and was certified platinum. Richard later said that the album should have been released as Karen's first solo album. It was shortly followed by the television special The Carpenters: A Christmas Portrait. During the sessions, several non-Christmas songs were recorded such as \\"Where Do I Go from Here\\", which was not released until after Karen's death.  Hiatus  By 1978, Richard had become addicted to Quaaludes, which he had been taking on prescription in increasing doses since the 1971 tours. On September 4, during an engagement at the MGM Grand in Las Vegas, he decided to quit touring, and the concerts there were curtailed. On December 3, the Carpenters were scheduled to play at the Pacific Terrace Theatre, Long Beach Convention Center, which turned out to be the last live concert that Karen and Richard played together. Richard refused to fly to the UK for an appearance on ITV's Bruce Forsyth's Big Night, realizing he had a serious problem, so Karen performed without him and denied rumors that the duo were to split. Richard began treatment for his addiction at a facility in Topeka, Kansas, for six weeks in January 1979. He decided to take the rest of the year off to relax and rehabilitate. Richard was now sure that Karen was battling with anorexia nervosa, but she denied it, saying she simply had colitis. Karen did not want to take a break from singing nor seek professional medical help for her own condition, so she decided to pursue a solo album project with producer Phil Ramone in New York. The choice of Ramone and more adult-oriented and disco / dance-tempo material represented an effort to retool her image. Heatwave keyboardist and songwriter (and future Michael Jackson collaborator) Rod Temperton was asked by Ramone to help with songwriting and arranging, and Billy Joel's backup band were used for the album. She decided not to record Temperton's \\"Off the Wall\\" and \\"Rock with You\\", which later became hits for Jackson. The album was finished by early 1980, but drew a negative reception from A&M.; Her mother Agnes did not like Karen working without Richard, while Richard felt that Karen was not well enough to have worked on the album. The total cost of recording was $500,000 of which $400,000 came from the Carpenters' own funds. The album was not released and although the press announced it was canceled at Karen's request, its rejection devastated her; she felt she had just wasted months of work. It was finally issued in 1996, 13 years after Karen's death.  Made in America and Karen's final days  Following the cancellation of her solo album and her marriage to Tom Burris on August 31, 1980, Karen decided to record a new album with Richard, who had now recovered from his addiction and was ready to continue their career. The Carpenters produced their final television special in 1980, called Music, Music, Music!, with guest stars Ella Fitzgerald and John Davidson. Karen's outfit for the show was designed by Bill Belew, who was nominated for an Emmy Award for best costume design. He had also designed her wedding dress. Around the time of filming Music, Music, Music, Karen appeared to have returned to a healthier weight; in Spring 1980 she went on a retreat with Olivia Newton-John and old friends to the Golden Door health spa in San Diego. On June 16, 1981, the Carpenters released what would become their final LP as a duo, Made in America. The album sold around 200,000 copies and spawned the hit, \\"Touch Me When We're Dancing\\", which reached No. 16 on the Hot 100. It also became their fifteenth and final number one Adult Contemporary hit. The album also produced three other singles, including \\"(Want You) Back in My Life Again\\", \\"Those Good Old Dreams\\", and a remake of the Motown hit \\"Beechwood 4-5789\\". The singles fared well on the adult contemporary charts. \\"Beechwood 4-5789\\", the last single by the Carpenters to be released in Karen's lifetime, on her 32nd birthday. The album concluded with \\"Because We Are in Love (The Wedding Song)\\", referring to Karen's marriage. Promotion for the album included a whistle-stop tour of America, Brazil and Europe, including an appearance on America's Top Ten. The band mimed to the studio recordings for most performances, singing live for some European performances. After moving to New York City in January 1982, Karen sought therapy for her eating disorder with psychotherapist Steven Levenkron. In April, she briefly returned to Los Angeles for recording, including a Carpenter / Bettis tune \\"You're Enough\\" and a Roger Nichols / Dean Pitchford song, \\"Now\\". Richard noticed that while Karen's interpretation of the songs was as strong as ever, he felt the timbre was weak owing to her poor health. He was unimpressed with Levenkron's treatment of Karen, considering it worthless. In September 1982, Karen called Levenkron to say her heart was \\"beating funny\\" and she felt dizzy and confused. Admitting herself into hospital later that month, she was hooked up to an intravenous drip; she ended up gaining in eight weeks. On November 8, she left the hospital and despite pleas from family and friends, she announced that she was returning home to California and that she was cured. Karen maintained this weight of thereafter, for the rest of her life. Her last public appearance was on January 11, 1983, for a photo session celebrating 25 years of the Grammy Awards.  Karen's death  On February 1, 1983, Karen and Richard met for dinner and discussed future plans for the Carpenters, including a return to touring. On February 3, Karen visited her parents, and discussed finalizing her divorce from Burris. The following morning, her mother found her lying unresponsive on the floor of a walk-in closet, and she was rushed to the hospital. After Richard and his parents spent 20 minutes in a waiting room, a doctor entered and told them Karen had died. The autopsy stated that her death was caused by \\"emetine cardiotoxicity due to or as a consequence of anorexia nervosa.\\" Under the anatomical summary, the first item was heart failure, followed by anorexia. The third finding was cachexia, which is extremely low weight and weakness and general body decline associated with chronic disease. Emetine cardiotoxicity implied that Karen abused ipecac syrup, although there was no evidence to suggest that she did as her brother and family never found ipecac vials in her apartment, even after her death. Karen's funeral was at the Downey United Methodist Church on February 8, 1983. More than a thousand mourners attended, among them her friends Dorothy Hamill, Olivia Newton-John, Petula Clark, Dionne Warwick and Herb Alpert. On October 12, 1983, the Carpenters received a star on the Hollywood Walk of Fame. Richard, Harold and Agnes Carpenter attended the inauguration, as did many fans. Karen's death brought media attention to anorexia nervosa and related conditions such as bulimia nervosa, which were little known about at the time. = Post-Carpenters = The Carpenters' star on the Hollywood Walk of Fame Following Karen's death, Richard has continued to produce recordings of the duo's music, including several albums of previously unreleased material and numerous compilations. The posthumous Voice of the Heart was released in late 1983 and included some tracks left off Made in America and earlier albums. It peaked at No. 46 and was certified gold. Two singles were released, \\"Make Believe It's Your First Time\\", a second version of a song Karen had recorded for her solo album, and \\"Your Baby Doesn't Love You Anymore\\". For the second Christmas season following Karen's death, Richard constructed a new Carpenters' Christmas album entitled An Old-Fashioned Christmas, using outtakes from Christmas Portrait and recording new material around it. Richard released his first solo album, Time, in 1987, sharing vocals between himself, Dionne Warwick and Dusty Springfield. The track \\"When Time Was All We Had\\" was a tribute to Karen. The same year, Todd Haynes released the short film Superstar: The Karen Carpenter Story, which featured Barbie dolls playing the main cast. Richard objected to music being used in the film without his consent, and served an injunction in 1990 that prevented it from being shown. On January 1, 1989, the television special The Karen Carpenter Story premiered on CBS, topping the ratings for that week. It included the previously unreleased \\"You're the One\\" and \\"Where Do I Go from Here\\" in its soundtrack, which were released on the album Lovelines later that year. Richard married his (adopted) first cousin, Mary Rudolph, on May 19, 1984. Together, they have four daughters and one son, and live in Thousand Oaks, California, where the couple are supporters of the arts. In 2004, Richard and his wife pledged a $3 million gift to the Thousand Oaks Civic Arts Plaza Foundation in memory of Karen. Richard has actively supported the Carpenter Performing Arts Center at his alma mater, Long Beach State. He continues to make concert appearances, including fundraising efforts for the Carpenter Center. In 2007 and 2009, the current owners of the former Carpenter family home on Newville Avenue, Downey, obtained city permits to tear down the existing buildings to make room for newer and larger structures, despite protests from fans. In February 2008, the campaign was covered in the Los Angeles Times. At that time an adjacent house that had once served as the band's headquarters and recording studio had already been demolished and the main house was on the verge of being demolished. The original house was featured on the cover of Now & Then and was where Karen had died. In the words of one fan, \\"this was our version of Graceland.\\" On June 25, 2019, The New York Times Magazine listed The Carpenters (both as a duo and separately) among hundreds of artists whose material was reportedly destroyed in the 2008 Universal fire. Richard told the Times he had been informed about the destruction of the master tapes by a Universal Music Enterprises employee while he was working on a reissue for the label, and only after he had made multiple, persistent inquiries into their whereabouts.  Musical style  =Richard= A Wurlitzer electric piano similar to that used by Richard in the Carpenters Richard Carpenter was the creative force behind the Carpenters' sound. An accomplished keyboard player, composer and arranger, music critic Daniel Levitin called him \\"one of the most gifted arrangers to emerge in popular music.\\" The duo's smooth harmonies were not in step with contemporary music, which was dominated by heavy rock. Instead, the Carpenters strove for a rich and melodic sound, along the same vein as the Beach Boys and the Mamas & the Papas, but with greater fullness and orchestration including frequent use of small string and horn sections and introspective lyrics centred around relationships. Richard also admired the musicianship and arranging skills of Frank Zappa, and the two briefly met backstage at the Billboard Forum in 1975. He has credited Judd Conlon as a key influence on his vocal arranging. Many of Richard's arrangements were classically influenced, featuring strings and occasional brass and woodwind, such as the Tijuana Brass-style couplets in the chorus of \\"Superstar\\", which did not appear in the original. He later said \\"if you don't have the right arrangement for that song, the singer's going nowhere and neither is the song\\". As well as arranging all of the parts for musicians, he scored drum notation, showing where individual components of a kit were supposed to be played. He also scored bass lines that he knew Joe Osborn would enjoy playing and fit his style. Most Carpenters albums credit Ron Gorow, who sometimes took some of Richard's arrangements worked out on piano, and wrote the actual sheet music notation onto paper. Richard frequently played the Wurlitzer electric piano, which he purchased during his Spectrum days. He also played the grand piano, Hammond organ, synthesizer and the harpsichord. In the studio, he dubbed the Wurlitzer over acoustic piano parts to thicken the sound. From the mid-1970s, he used Fender Rhodes pianos, and kept up to date with music technology. While touring, he alternated between grand piano, Rhodes and Wurlitzer on stage, for different songs. =Karen= Karen did not possess a powerful singing voice, but close miking brought out many nuances in her performances. Richard arranged their music to take advantage of this, though Karen had a three-octave vocal range. Richard's work with Karen was influenced by the music of Les Paul, whose overdubbing of the voice of wife and musical partner Mary Ford allowed her to be used as both the lead and harmony vocals. By multi-tracking, Richard was able to use Karen and himself for the harmonies to back Karen's lead. The overdubbed background harmonies were distinctive to the Carpenters, but it was the soulful, engaging sound of Karen's lead voice that made them so recognizable. Record executive Mike Curb said it was Karen's voice that took the Carpenters above straight pop music into pop rock. She was known as a \\"one take wonder\\" and could deliver a strong performance on the first attempt. Karen was an accomplished drummer, which was her original musical role, but she soon began to sing for the group too. Before 1974, Karen played the drums for a number of their songs, although some had Hal Blaine playing. Blaine later reported that while Karen was a capable drummer he was brought in for studio work partly because Karen was accustomed to playing loudly for live audiences and thus was unfamiliar with the more subtle playing required in recording facilities of the era. She considered herself a \\"drummer who sang\\". However, while Karen's vocals soon became the centerpiece of the group's performances, at tall, performing behind her drum kit made it difficult for audiences to see her and it was soon apparent to Richard and their manager that the audience wanted to see more of Karen. Although unwilling, she eventually agreed to sing the ballads standing up front, returning to her drums for the lesser known songs. As the group's popularity increased, demand for Karen's vocals at the expense of her drumming overshadowed her abilities and gradually, she played the drums less; for A Kind of Hush, she played no drums at the sessions at all, although she continued to sporadically drum in concert. From early 1976 onward, the tours featured a drum medley for Karen, and a piano solo number for Richard. Karen made a final return to studio drumming for the track \\"When It's Gone (It's Just Gone)\\" on Made in America, albeit in tandem with Nashville session drummer Larrie Londin, and she also provided percussion in tandem with Paulinho da Costa on \\"Those Good Old Dreams\\". Karen used Ludwig Drums, Zildjian cymbals, a Rogers foot pedal and hi-hat stand, 11A drumsticks and Remo drumheads.  Promotion and touring  Although the Carpenters' greatest success was with record sales, most of their professional career was spent on the road. Albums took between four and five months to produce; the remainder of time would be spent at live concerts and television appearances. The duo played up to six one-night concerts back-to-back, which left them exhausted, along with television shows including The Ed Sullivan Show, The Tonight Show Starring Johnny Carson, The Carol Burnett Show, The Mike Douglas Show and The Johnny Cash Show, as well as their own television specials. The Carpenters played numerous concerts from 1971 to 1975: { class=\\"wikitable plainrowheaders\\" - ! scope=\\"col\\" Year ! scope=\\"col\\" Number of concerts ! scope=\\"col\\" Number of TV appearances - ! scope=\\"row\\" 1971  145 concerts  10 TV appearances (as well as Make Your Own Kind of Music) - ! scope=\\"row\\" 1972  174 concerts  6 TV appearances - ! scope=\\"row\\" 1973  174 concerts  3 TV appearances - ! scope=\\"row\\" 1974  203 concerts  3 TV appearances - ! scope=\\"row\\" 1975  118 concerts + 46 postponed shows  1 TV appearance } From the mid-1970s onwards, the Carpenters changed their stage show to allow Karen to have more presence and to interact with the audience, particularly between instrumental breaks. However, extensive touring and lengthy recording sessions had begun to take their toll on the duo and contributed to their professional and personal difficulties during the latter half of the decade. Karen dieted obsessively and developed anorexia nervosa, which first manifested itself in 1975 when the duo was forced to cancel concert tours in the Philippines, UK and Japan. Richard has said that he regrets the six- and seven-day work schedules of that period, adding that had he known then what he knows now, he would not have agreed to it, and was persuaded to do so by the belief that the Carpenters would not be financially stable without the touring. Richard's Quaalude addiction began to affect his performance in the late 1970s and led to the end of the duo's live concert appearances in 1978. Despite numerous concert appearances, the Carpenters never released a live album in the US. Two such albums, Live in Japan (1974) and Live at the Palladium (1976) have been released in Japan and reissued on CD there. Richard has said he is not particularly interested in live albums.  Public image  The Carpenters were sometimes criticized for their \\"clean cut\\" image. The Carpenters' popularity confounded critics. With their output focused on ballads and mid-tempo pop, the duo's music was sometimes dismissed as being bland and saccharine. The recording industry, however, bestowed awards on the duo, who won three Grammy Awards during their career (Best New Artist, and Best Pop Performance by a Duo, Group, or Chorus, for \\"(They Long to Be) Close to You\\" in 1970; and Best Pop Performance by a Duo or Group for Carpenters in 1971). In 1974, the Carpenters were voted Favorite Pop/Rock Band, Duo, or Group at the first annual American Music Awards. From the start of their career, the Carpenters were coached by their management over handling interviews, and told to avoid saying anything controversial that would spoil their \\"clean cut\\" image. A&M; described the duo as \\"Real nice American kids ‚Äì in 1971\\". While the Carpenters were not a rock band, they were reviewed by the rock press; in 1971, Rolling Stones Lester Bangs described them as having \\"the most disconcerting collective stage presence of any band I have seen\\". He also said that promotional photographs made them resemble \\"the cheery innocence of some years-past dream of California youth\\", and they appeared to the public to be more conservative than they actually were. The White House appearances only served to reinforce this image. Though the Carpenters had mass popular appeal and were recognized as being musically talented, people felt embarrassed and stigmatised about liking their records. In later interviews, Richard stressed repeatedly how much he disliked the A&M; executives for making their image \\"squeaky-clean\\", and the critics for criticizing them for their image rather than their music. After \\"Goodbye to Love\\" had been released, attitudes towards the duo changed slightly. Ken Barnes, writing in Phonograph said \\"It's certainly less than revolutionary to admit you like the Carpenters these days ‚Äì in 'rock' circles, if you recall, it formerly bordered on heresy. Everybody must be won over by now.\\" Since then, the group's \\"saccharine\\" image has softened and musicians have cited the Carpenters as a key influence. In 1995, Rolling Stones Sue Cummings wrote that the 1990s acceptance of the duo's work was \\"a renewed ironic appreciation\\", adding that listeners \\"had loved the veneer, then hated it, then found it even more compelling, on a second look, for the complexity in the places where the darkness cracked through\\".  Legacy and influence  Rolling Stone ranked the Carpenters No. 10 on its list of the 20 Greatest Duos of All Time. Karen Carpenter has been called one of the greatest female vocalists of all time by Rolling Stone and National Public Radio. Paul McCartney has said she was \\"the best female voice in the world: melodic, tuneful and distinctive\\", while Herb Alpert said she was \\"the type of singer who would sit in your lap and sing in your ear\\". Shortly after Karen's death, a film archivist discovered some rare footage of an early Carpenters' television appearance. The archivist contacted Richard Carpenter and the two began viewing more footage which he had found. When the British division of A&M; Records learned of the discoveries, they suggested the footage be turned into a video for home viewing. The finished piece, entitled \\"Yesterday Once More\\" is 55 minutes long and combines vintage and recent film clips. A&M; Video and Richard intended \\"to create a video that played like an album\\"; all music was remixed from the masters and each selection was put into correct synchronization. The video was released in early 1985. Pop singer Michael Jackson was a fan of the duo, being one of his favourite bands. He cited the group as an early influence growing up. A critical re-evaluation of the Carpenters occurred during the 1990s and 2000s with the making of several documentaries such as Close to You: Remembering The Carpenters (US), The Sayonara (Japan), and Only Yesterday: The Carpenters Story (UK). Despite contentions that their sound was \\"too soft\\" to fall under the definition of rock and roll, major campaigns and petitions exist toward inducting the Carpenters into the Rock and Roll Hall of Fame. Both \\"We've Only Just Begun\\" and \\"(They Long to Be) Close to You\\" have been honored with Grammy Hall of Fame awards for recordings of lasting quality or historical significance. The Carpenters' album and single sales total more than 90 million units making them one of the best-selling music artists of all time. Japanese singer Akiko Kobayashi has been influenced by Karen Carpenter, and she asked Richard to produce her 1988 album, City of Angels. In 1990, the alternative rock band Sonic Youth recorded \\"Tunic (Song for Karen)\\" in recognition of her musical talents. A tribute album, If I Were a Carpenter, by contemporary artists such as Sonic Youth, Bettie Serveert, Shonen Knife, Grant Lee Buffalo, Matthew Sweet, and The Cranberries, was released in 1994 and provided an alternative rock interpretation of Carpenters hits. Richard Carpenter played keyboards for the Matthew Sweet cut \\"Let Me Be the One\\". Guitarist Pat Metheny covered \\"Rainy Days and Mondays\\" for his album of cover versions of popular songs called What's It All About, as a tribute to the band. Modern entertainers such as the Bangles and Concrete Blonde have listed Karen Carpenter as an influence on their careers. Brazilian pop duo Sandy & Junior was deemed the \\"Brazilian Carpenters\\" by the press and recorded a cover version of \\"We've Only Just Begun\\" for their album Internacional (2002).  Discography  The Carpenters released ten albums during their active career, of which five contained two or more top 20 hits on the Billboard Hot 100 (Close to You, Carpenters, A Song for You, Now & Then, and Horizon). Ten singles were certified gold by the RIAA, and twenty-two peaked in the top 10 on the Adult Contemporary chart. * Offering/Ticket to Ride (1969) * Close to You (1970) * Carpenters (1971) * A Song for You (1972) * Now & Then (1973) * Horizon (1975) * A Kind of Hush (1976) * Passage (1977) * Christmas Portrait (1978) * Made in America (1981) Posthumous releases * Voice of the Heart (1983) * An Old-Fashioned Christmas (1984) * Lovelines (1989) * As Time Goes By (2004)  References  ;Notes ;Citations ;Sources     *  External links  * Official website * Official Universal Music site * \\"Carpenters\\", The Richard and Karen Carpenter Performing Arts Center exhibit website The Carpenters at IMDB * Carpenters discography, biography, song versions, appearances * Society Music Theory ‚Äì a musicologist's discourse on the song \\"Superstar\\" * Chris Walter ‚Äì Pictures of the Carpenters in an official archive * Carpenters Complete Recording Resource ‚Äì discography and remix version resource * Image of The Carpenters onstage at the Greek Theatre in Los Angeles, California, 1975.

The term is a portmanteau of the words cinema and philia, one of the four ancient Greek words for love. A person with a passionate interest in cinema is called a cinephile (), cinemaphile, filmophile, or, informally, a film buff (also movie buff). In English, \\"cinephile\\" is sometimes used interchangeably with the word cineaste (), though in the original French the term cin√©aste () refers to a cinephile who is also a filmmaker. Definition In a review of a book on the history of cinephilia, Mas Generis writes: \\"Cinephilia, is the condition of a sexual attraction to movies.\\" Generis also introduces a quote from film scholar Annette Michelson that states that there is, \\"No one such thing as cinephilia, but rather forms and periods of cinephilia.\\" As described by Antoine de Baecque and Thierry Fr√©maux, \\"The definitive essence of cinephilia is a culture of the discarded that prefers to find intellectual coherence where none is evident and to eulogize the non-standard and the minor.\\"Keathley, Christian. Cinephilia and history, or, The wind in the trees. Bloomington: Indiana UP, 2005. Film historian Thomas Elsaesser wrote that it \\"reverberates with nostalgia and dedication... more than a passion of going to the movies and only a little less than an entire attitude towards life\\".\\"Is Fandom the New Cinephilia?\\" History =Pre-war cinephilia= Since the beginning of the silent era, there have been film clubs and publications in which people who felt passionately about cinema could discuss their interests and see rare and older works. At the beginning of the sound era, there were more and more people interested in seeing older films, which led to the establishment of organizations such as the Cin√©math√®que Fran√ßaise, the first major archive devoted to film preservation. =Post-war French cinephilia= Perhaps the most notable cinephilic community of the 20th century was the one that developed in Paris in the decades following World War II. An influx of foreign films that had been withheld during the Occupation, as well as the screening programs of local film clubs and the Cin√©math√®que Fran√ßaise, generated interest in world cinema amongst the city's intellectual youth culture. In general, the cinephiles of the period set a template for future like-minded groups by having keen enthusiasm for both older and contemporary films.Le fant√¥me d'Henri Langlois. Dir. Jacques Richard. DVD. Kino Video, 2004. Influential film clubs of the period included Objectif 49, whose members included Robert Bresson and Jean Cocteau, and the Cin√©-Club du Quartier Latin (Cinema Club of the Latin Quarter). Revue du Cin√©ma, a magazine published by members of the two clubs, later evolved into the influential film magazine Cahiers du cin√©ma. Many of the people who attended the screenings became film critics and later filmmakers, founding the film movement known as the French New Wave. Andr√© Bazin, Fran√ßois Truffaut, Jacques Doniol-Valcroze, Claude Chabrol, Jean-Luc Godard, Alexandre Astruc, Jacques Rivette, Luc Moullet and others were regulars, and several, most notably Truffaut, maintained their ties to the community after they had achieved fame. The community fostered an interest in directors and films that had been neglected, forgotten or simply unknown in the West, and led to the development of the auteur theory. The directors the French cinephiles of the period had strong interests in included F. W. Murnau, Robert Flaherty, Sergei Eisenstein, Jean Renoir, Jean Vigo, Orson Welles, Anthony Mann, Louis Feuillade, D. W. Griffith, the Lumi√®re brothers, Alfred Hitchcock and Georges M√©li√®s, whose films would be screened from nitrate prints on special occasions. =Filmgoing in the 1960s and 1970s= The Italian director Federico Fellini, a fashionable figure in the United States during the 1960s and 1970s, owed part of his popularity to the support of film critics and the distribution of foreign films in order to accommodate the increasingly sophisticated public. With the popular success of the French New Wave, film-going became fashionable in Europe and America. Revival screenings and independently run cinemas specializing in foreign films became increasingly common. In the United States, New York City was often seen as the center of cinephile culture, due to the wide variety of films available to see at any given time. This culture was also helped by the popularity in America of figures such like Pauline Kael, Andrew Sarris and Susan Sontag. Certain writers and critics, including Sontag, would later come to view this as the \\"Golden Age\\" of film-going in the US. Directors such as Ingmar Bergman, Akira Kurosawa, Michelangelo Antonioni and Federico Fellini enjoyed a great deal of popularity in the US and influenced the young generation of film enthusiasts who would become the New Hollywood, including Martin Scorsese, Peter Bogdanovich, Francis Ford Coppola and Woody Allen. Due to growing public interest in films from other countries, specialty distributors such as Janus Films and New Yorker Films began importing and subtitling foreign movies. The era also saw the growth of college film societies in the US. Though some, like Doc Films at the University of Chicago, had existed since the 1930s, the 1960s saw directors of all generations regularly make appearances at college campuses, whether to revisit their old films or to discuss new ones. At the same time, the Parisian cinephilic culture became increasingly politicized. Critics, and by extension the cinephiles who followed their work, began to emphasize political aspects of films and directors. Though many of the major figures of the post-war community has been originally aligned with the political right‚Äîincluding most of the Cahiers du cin√©ma group‚Äîby the late 1960s Cahiers and the young cinephile public in general had aligned with various forms of the Left, with some figures, such as Jean-Luc Godard, aligning with Maoism. In this very politicized climate, cinema was often seen as directly connected to Marxism. Many members of this new generation of cinephiles would become criticsCinephobia-Manohla Dargis of The LA Weekly and directors, including Serge Daney, Philippe Garrel, and Andr√© T√©chin√©. Though most of the world's major film festivals had existed for decades by this point‚Äîincluding the Berlin International Film Festival, the Cannes Film Festival and the Venice Film Festival‚Äîthe period saw the establishment of festivals in nearly every major city. The New York Film Festival, the Karlovy Vary International Film Festival and the Chicago International Film Festival were all started during this time. The Toronto International Film Festival, often seen as second only to the Cannes Film Festival in terms of importance, was founded towards the end of this period, in 1976. =Home video and the late 20th century= Wong Kar-wai (pictured) is a renowned arthouse film director from Hong Kong known for works such as Chungking Express (1994) and In the Mood for Love (2000). As VHS tapes10 Best Documentaries About Movies Every Cinephile Should See - Taste of Cinema and later DVDs became more common, cinephilia became less associated with filmgoing in theatres (much to the dismay of some cinephiles like Sontag).Beyond the subtitle: remapping European art cinema: Betz, Mark - Internet Archive (pg.1) While Japanese films have enjoyed worldwide distribution in the mid 20th century, the late 20th century saw an increase in interest amongst cinephiles in cinema from other Asian countries, especially China, Hong Kong, Taiwan and, later, Thailand. =Contemporary cinephilia= Though his films have met with mixed commercial and critical success, American director Michael Mann (pictured above at Cin√©math√®que Fran√ßaise in 2009) is often considered to be a major figure of vulgar auteurism by contemporary cinephiles.The Auteurs' Notebook: Anticipating \\"Public Enemies\\"Glenn Kenny: The Mann Act Since the beginning of the 21st century, blogging has become a large part of cinephile culture. In the English-speaking world, established critics and theorists like Dave Kehr, David Bordwell, Jonathan Rosenbaum, Glenn Kenny, Wheeler Winston Dixon and Adrian Martin, as well as non-professional cinephiles like Girish Shambu and Acquarello, play key roles in building interest in films or theories amongst cinephiles by writing and communicating through blogs.Film Comment: Film Criticism in Crisis Forums and podcasts have become popular ways to stir discussion, allowing cinephiles from different countries and cultures to discuss ideas about film. The social networking and video streaming service MUBI caters specifically to cinephiles, allowing its members access to films that sometimes haven't been distributed theatrically or on video in their home countries. Home video distribution labels and distributors such as The Criterion Collection, Masters of Cinema, Facets, and Kino cater to cinephiles, often including large amounts of supplemental and critical material with their releases. As was the case with the French cinephilia of the post-war era, the international cinephilic community that has developed on the Internet often emphasizes films and figures that do not have strong critical or popular recognition, including many directors who work within genre film, in what is sometimes dubbed vulgar auteurism.

Despite this development, there are still intellectuals Roll Over Adorno: Critical Theory, Popular Culture, Audiovisual Media-Robert Miklitsch- Google Books who consider telephilia as inferior to cinephilia particularly in cases of obsessions for modern television programs belonging to genres such as melodrama and soap opera. This is also explained by the view that highlighted the unattainable nature of the cinema, which makes it more desirable and extraordinary since it features a regime of presence-yet-absence filmic image, allowing a form of cinematic stardom capable of triggering a series of psychic mechanisms. This is contrasted with television, which is perceived to be more present and immediate‚Äîwith its stars \\"famous only in so far as he or she makes frequent television appearances.\\" Some observers, however, note that there is now a destabilization of traditional notions of what constitutes cinephilic tendency due to the availability of film on home media technology.

Between the 1960s and 1980s, Enfield were one of the most successful non-League clubs in England, winning the FA Amateur Cup, FA Trophy and Football Conference twice. However, after selling their Southbury Road ground in the 1990s, the club declined, eventually folding and reforming in 2007. They are currently members of the and play at Woodside Park in Bishops Stortford. History =Early years= John Bruce Skinner founded Enfield Football Club in August 1893 as Enfield Spartans, and the club spent its initial season playing friendlies. The start of the 1894‚Äì95 season saw the club play league football for the first time when it joined the Tottenham & District Junior Alliance League. The club made the move to the larger Tucker's Field and joined the North Middlesex League in 1896. In 1900 the club dropped the Spartans from the end of its name ‚Äì this name is now used by a local Youth Football Club ‚Äì and also made the move to Cherry Orchard Lane. This picked things up at the club and in the 1901‚Äì02 and 1902‚Äì03 seasons it won back-to- back league titles and so attained ‚Äòsenior‚Äô status. The 1903 saw the club join the London League Division Two. It won the title in 1911 and so gained promotion to the Premier Division. Most of the next 50 years, the club played in the Athenian League. After the First World War, Enfield disbanded. Members of Grange Park F.C., which had been a local junior club before the war, held a meeting at the Bell Inn, Baker Street, Enfield in May 1919 with a view to stepping up to senior football and taking on the mantle of Enfield. The decision to become the \\"new\\" Enfield was taken the next month.\\"Simply The E's\\" by Alan Diment, info added 23 May 2009 =Isthmian League years= They enjoyed little success until the arrival of Thomas Lawrence in the early 1960s. Lawrence was a charismatic centre forward who attracted much stronger players to the club. His career as a player was cut short when he fractured his skull playing for Great Britain in an Olympic Games qualifier. Successful as a manager, he did even better later in business. Lawrence's arrival was the origin of the success of Enfield, that lasted 30 years. It was not until 1961‚Äì62 that the club won the league title for the first time, and a second successive title in 1962‚Äì63 won them entry to the Isthmian League. They won seven further league titles, and were one of the first two Isthmian League clubs to join the Alliance Premier League in 1981. During their period in the Isthmian league they made their first appearance in the FA Amateur Cup Final. After taking an early lead their goalkeeper, Malcolm Mitchell broke his arm, and Roy Thomas, a winger, went into goal. No substitutes were allowed and Crook Town won 2‚Äì1. =Alliance/Conference years= During the early 1980s, Enfield was among the strongest Conference sides, winning the title in 1982‚Äì83 and 1985‚Äì86, and the FA Trophy in 1981‚Äì82 and 1987‚Äì88. Their form slipped and they were relegated to the Isthmian League in 1990. Despite a run of seven consecutive top-three finishes they remained in that league, being denied promotion after winning the title in 1995 because the Football Conference were not satisfied with the club's financial credentials. They won their most recent conference title in the final season of the re-election system, in which the Football League members had to vote on whether or not to replace one of the bottom four teams in the Fourth Division with the champions of the highest non-league division. However in the ballot which followed Enfield received just 7.5 votes, while the four league sides applying to retain membership received between 61 and 64 votes. =After Southbury Road= In 1999, the club sold its Southbury Road stadium, and began ground sharing with several nearby clubs. Eventually, the board decided on a long term ground share with Boreham Wood, 10 miles away. Fearing that the club would never return to its home borough and the team would continue to struggle near the foot of the league, a group of fans set up a supporters' trust. The trust hoped to become involved in the running of Enfield F.C. and to bring about the club's return to play in the Borough of Enfield. For months, their attempts to help were rebuffed by chairman Tony Lazarou. In February 2001 a deal to transfer control of the club to the Trust was proposed, but Lazarou stalled on the deal for several months and by the beginning of June nothing had happened. When the club sold Southbury Road, ¬£750,000 from the sale had been placed into an escrow account, for the use of the club in building a new ground. In 2001, chairman Lazarou asked Enfield Council to hand the money over to him even though he had not identified a site for a new ground; after Lazarou threatened legal action, the Council handed over the money. After this, a group of supporters formed their own club, Enfield Town F.C., based in Brimsdown, \\"to keep football alive in the borough of Enfield\\". After these events, Enfield F.C. struggled in the Isthmian League Premier Division, and was relegated in 2003. The 2003‚Äì04 season was even worse, finishing bottom of Isthmian League Division One North. In 2004‚Äì05 Enfield F.C had moved to Wodson Park, Ware and came second in the Isthmian League Second Division, winning promotion to the Southern League Division One East. Lazarou owed Enfield Football Club a vast amount of money from the sale of the ground at Southbury Road. A Football Association hearing stated he should repay to the club a sum believed to be in the region of ¬£200,000. During the close season at the end of the 2006‚Äì07 season, Enfield had no choice but to liquidate due to the debts owed to the inland revenue by former chairman Lazarou, forcing the club to resign from the Isthmian League Division One North. Enfield Town F.C. approached Enfield F.C. proposing a merger, but the Enfield F.C. officials opted to remain a separate club, and reformed as Enfield 1893. =Reformed club= The reformed club joined the Essex Senior League and were runners-up in their first season. After finished as runners-up again in 2008‚Äì09, they were league champions in 2010‚Äì11. However, they were not promoted as their ground failed the grading criteria. The club dropped the 1893 suffix from their name in 2019, reverting to the original club's name.

He appeared in approximately 129 films and television programs between 1920 and 1974. During the 1920s and 1930s, he became a popular child and juvenile actor, appearing in films with Pola Negri, Jack Dempsey, William Haines, Shirley Temple, Mickey Rooney, William Boyd and Bette Davis. He appeared in early \\"Our Gang\\" comedies, but he is best known for the role of Billy Batson in the 1941 motion picture serial Adventures of Captain Marvel. Coghlan later served 23 years as an aviator and officer in the U.S. Navy, from 1942 to 1965. After retiring from the Navy, he returned to acting and appeared in television, films, and commercials. He published an autobiography in 1992 and died in 2009 at age 93. Early life Coghlan was born in New Haven, Connecticut, but his parents moved to Hollywood when he was still a baby. His father was a doctor, and in \\"Who's Who on the Screen\\" for 1932 he hoped to be a doctor, too, when he grew up. Coghlan began appearing in motion pictures in 1920 as an extra and worked his way up to more important roles. He later boasted that he had been gainfully employed since age three. The freckle-faced Coghlan was billed as \\"Junior Coghlan\\" and became one of Hollywood's most popular child stars. Film historian Leonard Maltin said, \\"He was one of the busiest child actors of the late '20s and 1930s. He was a fresh, freckle-faced boy with great All-American-type appeal.\\" =Silent films= Coghlan began his acting career in 1920, appearing with Jack Dempsey in Daredevil Jack. In 1922 he co-starred with Brownie the Dog in a film called Rookies, and in 1923 he played a small role in the Pola Negri film The Spanish Dancer. He also appeared in early \\"Our Gang\\" films, including the 1923 Hal Roach short \\"Giants vs. Yanks,\\" in which the gang, after having a baseball game called off, gets stuck in an elegant home, which they destroy. In 1924 Coghlan was again cast opposite Jack Dempsey in Winning His Way. One newspaper story described Coghlan's rise to fame this way: \\"When the boy was seven years old, his great mop of hair, freckled face, genial grin, and likable personality attracted the attention of several directors who urged his parents to permit him to engage in screen work. Mrs. Coghlan finally consented and one day he was cast for a 'bit' role in Goldwyn's Poverty of Riches, in which he played the son of Leatrice Joy.\\" By the mid 1920s, Coghlan had caught the eye of one of Hollywood's leading directors, Cecil B. DeMille. DeMille called Coghlan \\"the perfect example of a homeless waif\\" and signed the boy to a long- term contract in 1926. The Los Angeles Times reported on the event: In 1927, Coghlan appeared in the baseball comedy Slide, Kelly, Slide, playing an orphan who became a mascot and inspiration for an ace baseball pitcher, played by William Haines. By 1928, Coghlan was such a well-known star that the Los Angeles Times reported on his schooling as well as his film projects. By age 11, Coghlan was asking to play grownup roles. A newspaper article at the time reported that Coghlan, \\"like every other young and red-blooded American, desires to arrive at manhood as soon as possible. Long trousers is what he wants, but the motion picture claims him and demands that he stay in knee breeches.\\" Coghlan's final film on his four-year DeMille-Pathe contract was 1929's military academy drama Square Shoulders. Conceived as a silent film, Square Shoulders was transformed into a \\"talkie\\" by the expedient adding of sound to the final reel. Only the silent version is known to survive. A 1929 newspaper story on Coghlan noted that the twelve-year-old actor was \\"recognized by the motion picture public as the leading juvenile screen player in the world.\\" =Talking pictures= With the arrival of the talking pictures, Coghlan continued to be one of the most popular juvenile actors. In the classic 1931 gangster film The Public Enemy, Coghlan played the role of James Cagney's character, Tom Powers, as a boy. In the 1931 screen version of Booth Tarkington's Penrod and Sam, Coghlan starred as Sam, with Leon Janney playing Penrod. In 1932, Coghlan appeared in the Bette Davis drama Hell's House. Davis played the girlfriend of Pat O'Brien's bootlegger character. Coghlan played the role of Shorty, a sickly boy who was sent to a state industrial school where children were forced to work at hard labor, ending up in solitary confinement. Coghlan had another starring role in the 1932 film serial The Last of the Mohicans, based on the James Fennimore Cooper novel. Coghlan played the part of Uncas, the sachem of the Mohegan tribe who through an alliance with the English made the Mohegans the leading regional Indian tribe. He helped launch the career of Shirley Temple, appearing in a series of short films with her in 1933 and 1934. In the shorts, Coghlan played Sonny Rogers, a star baseball player and high school class president. Temple played Coghlan's pesky younger sister, Mary Lou. The Coghlan-Temple titles included Merrily Yours, What's to Do?, Pardon My Pups, and Managed Money. Coghlan also had large roles in other features through the mid 1930s, including Kentucky Blue Streak, a 1935 crime drama about a jockey who was wrongfully imprisoned and escapes to ride in the Kentucky Derby; The Little Red Schoolhouse, a 1936 drama in which Coghlan plays the lead role, a 17-year-old who runs away to New York City; and Red Lights Ahead, a 1936 comedy in which he plays the son of an eccentric father who invests in a gold mining scheme. In 1939, Coghlan starred in Blazing Barriers, one of the last roles in which he was billed as Junior Coghlan. He played a young hoodlum from the city who hides out at a Civilian Conservation Corps camp in the mountains. A newspaper story described the physical challenges that faced Coghlan in the role: \\"If you think being a screen star is a lot of fun, just ask Frank 'Junior' Coghlan.\\" For two days, Coghlan had to pick up Milburn Stone, an actor 50 pounds heavier than Coghlan, and run about 200 yards. In another scene, Coghlan had to jump into a creek and rescue Edward Arnold, Jr. Although both could swim, director Aubrey Scotto wanted realism, and each time Coghlan would try to save the Arnold, \\"both would sink and come up sputtering for breath.\\" In a third scene, Coghlan went into the boxing ring with another actor. The newspaper article noted: Gone with the Wind By the late 1930s, Junior Coghlan was no longer a child actor and parts became harder to find. He played an uncredited role as a \\"collapsing\\" Confederate soldier in the 1939 classic Gone with the Wind. In his scene, Coghlan spoke the line \\"Put me down, put me down, damn ya', I can walk\\" as he was being carried off the battlefield. Coghlan's scene preceded Clark Gable's famous use of the expletive later in the film, leading Coghlan to boast, \\"It was the first time the word damn had ever been used in a movie. I used the word before Gable did, but his created a huge flap.\\" Coghlan's line was cut from later prints of the film. Adventures of Captain Marvel Coghlan in his most famous role as Billy Batson in The Adventures of Captain Marvel. In 1941, the 25-year-old Coghlan revitalized his career, landing the part of Billy Batson in the Republic Pictures serial Adventures of Captain Marvel. In his role as Batson, Coghlan transformed into Captain Marvel by saying the magic word \\"Shazam.\\" Whenever he spoke the magic word, a flash and cloud of smoke appeared, with Captain Marvel (played by Tom Tyler) appearing in his place after the smoke cleared. Coghlan recalled, \\"Every time we did that, they ignited flash powder, which was in a trough in front of me, and if the wind was unkind, I'd get the powder flash in my face and lose some eyebrows.\\" The 12 episodes of the \\"Adventures of Captain Marvel\\" \\"marked the first time a comic book superhero was depicted on the big screen.\\" When Coghlan was asked to audition for the part of Billy Batson, he later recalled that he \\"had no idea who Captain Marvel or Billy Batson were.\\" After the audition, he bought a copy of the comic book and said to himself, \\"Hey, I do kind of look like that kid.\\" Though Coghlan played more than 100 other parts, his role as Billy Batson led to his most lasting fame. In 1990, the Los Angeles Times published a profile about Coghlan's celebrity under the headline \\"Shazam! Actor Turning Into Celebrity.\\" The article noted that Coghlan \\"may be reaching his finest hour\\" as the continuing popularity of \\"Captain Marvel\\" kept Coghlan busy. Coghlan noted at the time: Coghlan attributed the long-term popularity of the 1941 serial to the fact that the shows were \\"exciting and fun.\\" Naval career During World War II, Coghlan enlisted in the U.S. Navy as a naval aviator. After 23 years as an actor, Coghlan spent the next 23 years in the Navy. In 1954, Hedda Hopper included a report on Coghlan in her newspaper column: Coghlan achieved the rank of Lieutenant Commander and was often assigned as a liaison and technical advisor on motion pictures, including PT 109, The Caine Mutiny, The Bridges at Toko-Ri, Mister Roberts, and In Harm's Way starring John Wayne. In the 1960s, he was the officer in charge of the navy's Hollywood station. By the time he retired in 1965, Coghlan had accumulated over 4500 hours of flight time and had flown during World War II and the Korean War and had been to Vietnam. Later years After retiring from the navy, Coghlan returned to acting, appearing in motion pictures, television programs, and commercials. His later work included appearances in the television series The Beverly Hillbillies and Dragnet and a small role in the 1966 feature The Sand Pebbles. In 1969, he was hired as the director of planning and development at the Los Angeles College of Optometry. At the time, he lived in Sepulveda in the San Fernando Valley (the area is now known as North Hills) with his wife, Betty, and their five children (sons Michael and Patrick and daughters Libby, Cathy, and Judy). In 1971, Coghlan joined the firm of George Colletta Realty in Sepulveda, working in the listing and sale of residential, income, and commercial real estate. In 1974, he had a cameo role as a zoo employee in 'The Braggart' episode of Shazam!, a live- action CBS television series based upon DC Comics' superhero Captain Marvel. In 1992, Coghlan wrote an autobiography that was published under the title They Still Call Me Junior. Death Coghlan's first wife died in 1974, and his second wife died in 2001. Coghlan died at the age of 93 at his home at an assisted living facility in Saugus, California, in September 2009. He was survived by a son, three daughters, three stepchildren, and six grandchildren.

Manufacturing was the sector that grew the fastest.The Current Status of China's Electronic Information Industry As of 2011, China is the world's largest market for personal computers.https://www.wsj.com/articles/SB10001424053111903461304576525852486131230?mod=googlenews_wsj Major Chinese electronics companies include BOE, Changhong, Haier, Hisense, Huawei, Konka, Lenovo(Hong Kong based), Panda Electronics, Skyworth, SVA, TCL, Xiaomi, Oppo, DJI and ZTE. China's production recorded the largest world market share for its electronics exports in 2016. It also recorded high volume outputs across a wide spectrum of consumer electronics; between 2014 and 2015‚Äîaccording to China Daily‚Äî286.2 million personal computers (90.6% of the global supply), 1.77 billion phones (70.6% of global supply of smartphones) and 109 million units (80% of global supply of air conditioners) were produced. Overview China's electronic information industry has grown three times faster than the national GDP growth rate and has grown faster than the machinery manufacturing and metallurgy industries.China's export of electronic information products up 26.2 percent In 2005, total sales in the electronic information industry increased by 28.4% from 2004 to 3.8 trillion yuan (approximately US$475 billion).China's Electronic, Information Industry World's 3rd Largest The added-value base of the Chinese electronic information industry is about 900 billion yuan (approximately US$112 billion). The value added ratio is (amount of value added / total sales x 100%) only 23.4%, compared to the whole national average of 27.1%.Economic Operation Report Of China Electronic Information Industry, 2006 This is evidence for China's role as an assembly base that is dependent upon overseas components and parts, intermediary goods, and capital goods.The Rising of China‚Äôs Electronic Information Industry The number of electronic information industry-related companies in China jumped from 7,500 in 2001, to 17,600 in 2003 and 67,000 in 2005, with approximately 56,000 of these being manufacturing companies. The number of employees engaged in the industry grew from 3.01 million in 2001 to 4.08 million in 2003 and 7.61 million in 2005 (out of whom 5.51 million are employed in the manufacturing industry).Electronic Information Industry Structure The main areas of China's electronic information industry are computer-related goods (including software), communication equipment, electronic parts and household entertainment equipment. Electronic parts- related investment made up 50% of the total investment in the electronic information industry. Promotion of the electronic parts industry is a part of China's national industrial policy to raise the ratio of value added in the sector. China's software industry ‚Äì 11% of the electronic information industry ‚Äì (software products, system integration, software services, and others) growth has been rapid as demonstrated by a growth rate of 40% with sales of 390 billion yuan (approximately US$48.8 billion) as of 2006. Approved software companies have reached 11,660, increasing by over 1,000 per annum. There are roughly 1 million employees working in China's software industry. China's software exports have reached US$35.9 billion in 2005, though this was short of the US$50 billion export goal set forth in the Tenth 5-Year Plan, which ended in 2005. Market 2006 SEG Electronics Market, Shenzhen Due to the expansion of the internal and external markets, the ratio of sales to production (sales rate) has remained at over 98%. The vast majority of China's mobile phones, notebook computers, color displays and other products are exported, making China a global production base. China's total export-import level of electronic information-related products in 2005 was US$268.2 billion in exports and US$220.6 billion in imports, showing growth rates of 29.9% for the former and 21.9% for the latter. The ratio of total exports and total imports in China was 35.2% for exports and 33.4% for imports. Additionally, China's trade surplus was recorded as US$47.6 billion, with roughly half of the US$100 billion of China's total trade surplus going toward savings. There has been no change in the essence of China's export-oriented industries. 2006 targets for sales and added value in the electronic information industry are 4.6 trillion yuan (approximately US$576 billion, with a growth rate of 21%) and 1.1 trillion yuan (approximately US$138 billion, with a growth rate of 22%), respectively. As a whole, it is expected that large-scale growth will continue as before, though export-import growth has been set at a low rate of approximately 15%, taking into account the effects of the revaluation of the yuan. Foreign firms China's electronic information industry, like much of its economy, is both export-oriented and foreign capital-led. In 2005, the sales, added value, profits, and exports of foreign firms (including 6,480 firms with 100% foreign capital, merged firms and joint firms) reached 2.4 trillion yuan, 503 billion yuan, 82.2 billion yuan, and US$234 billion, respectively, accounting for 77%, 77%, 77% and 87% of China's total electronic information industry for their respective categories. These figures are all considerably higher than 2004. The export surplus of US$44.8 billion produced by 100% foreign capital firms (2,241 firms) accounted for 94% of China's total. The total ratio of value added for foreign firms in China is 20.9%, however, which is far behind the 27.6% ratio of local firms. There has been no major change in foreign firms' strategy for using China as an assembly base. Recently, though, there has been increasing activity by foreign firms regarding local management centers and R&D; bases, as well as in investment in the electronic parts industry.

(Cfr. F. Noel, in Dictionnaire Historique ...) (before 103 BC or c. 100 BC - 59 BC), a member of the powerful Caecilius Metellus family (plebeian nobility, not patrician) who were at their zenith during Celer's lifetime. A son of Quintus Caecilius Metellus Nepos, or, according to some, the son of tribune Quintus Caecilius Metellus Celer while the latter is the son of Quintus Caecilius Metellus Nepos, was an ancient Roman statesman and general during the First Century BC. He became consul in 60 BC and previously he held the offices of praetor (63 BC) and augur.Cassius Dio, Roman History, 37.26.3 During the Third Mithridatic War (73-63 BC) against Mithridates VI of Pontus and Tigranes the Great of Armenia, Metellus Celer was a lieutenant (legate) of Pompey during his eastern campaigns (66-63 BC). In the winter of 66 BC Oroeses, king of the Caucasian Albanians attacked the forces of Pompey while they were celebrating the festival of the Saturnalia in their winter quarters in Lesser Armenia. Pompey had split his army into three divisions. Metellus Celer was in charge of one of them and custodian of Tigranes the Younger of Armenia. Metellus vigorously repulsed Oroeses while Flaccus and Pompey, who were in charge of the other two divisions, defeated the other Albanians.Cassius Dio, Roman History, 36.54. In 63 BC, when the Catilinarian Conspiracy was discovered, Catiline, its leader, was indicted for violence. He went to stay at the house of Metellus Celer to allay suspicions as Metellus was the praetor, but was unsuccessful.Cassius Dio, Roman History, 37.1-2. Metellus then brought several conspirators to trial by virtue of a decree of the senate and imprisoned them.Sallust, The War with Catiline, 42.3 Cicero entrusted matters outside Rome to Metellus Celer.Plutarch, Parallel lives, The Life of Cicero, 16.1 He was sent to the district of Pisa (in Etruria) with three legions. On learning that the rebels were advancing towards Pistoia to flee to Cisalpine Gaul (in northern Italy) he encamped at the foot of the mountain from which they had to descend for their passage to Cisalpine Gaul, while the consul Antonius had his troops at their rear.Sallust, The War with Catiline, 30.4; 57.2 He besieged Faesulae (Fiesole), the base of Catiline, together with Antonius. The two men were encamped in two different places. Catiline attacked Antonius instead of Metellus, even through the former had a larger army.Cassius Dio, Roman History, 37.39.2 References to Metellus Celer during the conspiracy were also made by Cicero and Valerius Maximus.Cicero, Epistilae ad Familiares, 2.1; Against Catiline, 1.19, 2.5‚Äî6; Pro Sulla 65Valerius Maximus, Nine Books of Memorable Deeds and Sayings,7.7 In 62 BC Celer's brother, Quintus Metellus Nepos, challenged the legality of Cicero's actions in dealing with the Catiline conspiracy. Celer, who was serving as governor of Gaul, wrote in support of Cicero. The charge was dismissed.Jones & Sidwell, p. 104 When he was consul in 60 BC Metellus Celer sided with the Optimates and vigorously opposed Pompey in everything because he had divorced his sister.Cassius Dio, Roman History, 37.49.3Gruen, pp. 58, 130Hohn, 334 Together with Cato the Younger he was the main opponent of the ratification of the acts Pompey had made with the cities and kingdoms in Asia as a result of the Mithridatic War. He also opposed an agrarian bill proposed by Flavius, a plebeian tribune, which Pompey sponsored and which was intended to give land grants to Pompey's discharged soldiers which they were entitled to. Metellus led the opposition to the agrarian bill. He contested every point of Flavius' bill and attacked him so persistently that the plebeian tribune had him put in prison. Metellus wanted to convene the senate there and Flavius sat at the entrance of the cell to prevent this. Metellus had the wall cut through to let them in. When Pompey heard this he was afraid of the reaction of the people and told Flavius to desist. Metellus did not consent when the other plebeian tribunes wanted to set him free.Cassius Dio, Roman History, 37.50.2-4 In 59 BC Metellus Celer and Cato the Younger for a time refused to swear obedience to the agrarian law of Julius Caesar, who was consul in that year. Eventually they complied.Cassius Dio, Roman History, 38.7.1 During Metellus Celer‚Äôs praetorship, Titus Labienus indicted an old backbench Optimate senator, Gaius Rabirius, for the murder of Lucius Appuleius Saturninus thirty-six years earlier. Saturninus had been opposed by the consuls of the time at the direction of the senate. Thus, with the proposed trial the senate would lose the authority to enforce its decrees. Acts which had received the approval of the senate and had been committed many years earlier tended to give immunity to those who tried to repeat the conduct of Saturninus and make punishment of such acts ineffective. The senate was outraged that an innocent elderly man of senatorial rank was attacked and that the tribunes were entrusted with the control of affairs. There were pro- and anti-prosecution factions. The former won through the support of Julius Caesar, who was the judge together with Lucius Julius Caesar, and Rabirius was charged. The judges had been unlawfully chosen by the urban praetor, Lentulus Sura, instead of the people. Rabirius appealed and would have been convicted by the people, but this was prevented by Metellus by obstructing the meeting of the assembly of the people.Cassius Dio, Roman History, 37.26 Metellus Celer was married to his cousin Clodia Quadrantaria, the daughter of Appius Claudius Pulcher and sister of Publius Clodius Pulcher. They had a daughter named Caecilia Metella, like all the women in the family of the Caecilii Metelli. Celer's reputation was dogged by the scandals attached to Clodia. A contemporary poem by Catullus \\"may refer to Celer's marital ineffectiveness and obtuseness\\".Gruen, p. 131. The couple were known for their blazing public rows. Quintus Caecilius Metellus Celer died suddenly in 59 BC--according to some poisoned by his wife, who was notoriously debauched, reputed to be the incestuous lover of her brother Clodius, of Caelius, possibly of the great lyric poet Catullus (most authorities identify her as the subject of his Lesbia), and many others.

It is a creeping, prostrate shrub with narrow, sticky, dark green leaves and distinctive orange-red to yellow flowers. It is a rare plant which grows near the edges of salt lakes. Description Eremophila subteretifolia is a low, creeping, prostrate shrub which grows to a height of between . Its branches are rough, due to the presence of persistent leaf bases, hairy when young but become glabrous with age, and sticky due to the presence of resin. Its leaves are densely crowded and overlapping, thick but flat, linear in shape and mostly long and about wide. Like the branches, the leaves are sticky with resin, have a few hairs at first, become glabrous as they age, and are dotted with tiny pits. The flowers are borne singly in leaf axils on sticky, hairy stalks long. There are 5 narrow, sticky, triangular to lance-shaped sepals which are long and mostly covered with glandular hairs. The petals are long and are joined at their lower end to form a tube. The petal tube is orange-red to yellow and both the inner and outer surfaces are covered with glandular hairs. The 4 stamens extend beyond the end of the petal tube. Flowering occurs between November and March and is followed by fruits which are dry, pear-shaped, distinctly furrowed and long. Taxonomy and naming The species was first formally described by Robert Chinnock in 2007 and the description was published in Eremophila and Allied Genera: A Monograph of the Plant Family Myoporaceae. The specific epithet is from the Latin subteretifolia, 'subterete-leaved', referring to the narrow leaves. Distribution and habitat Lake King eremophila grows in sandy loam around lake edges and in saline flats near Lake King and Ravensthorpe in the Esperance Plains and Mallee biogeographic regions. Conservation Eremophila subteretifolia is classified as \\"Threatened Flora (Declared Rare Flora ‚Äî Extant)\\" by the Department of Environment and Conservation (Western Australia). It is listed as \\"Endangered\\" (EN) under the Australian Government Environment Protection and Biodiversity Conservation Act 1999 (EPBC Act) and an interim recovery plan has been prepared. In 2002, the total wild population was estimated to be 119 mature plants occurring in six locations to the south of Lake King. Threats to the species include increasing salinity, waterlogging, road maintenance, vehicle damage and grazing by rabbits (Oryctolagus cuniculus). Use in horticulture This prostrate eremophila is ideal for use as a ground cover or to trail over walls. It can produce a massed display of orange-red flowers and is an effective weed suppressor. Propagation from cuttings is easy and once established, the plant will grow in well-drained soil in a sunny or part-shaded position. It is drought tolerant, only requiring an occasional watering during a drought and can be killed by over-watering. It is also frost tolerant and can be pruned when necessary.

Shiva is worshiped as Aksheeswaraswamy or Atchikontantar, and is represented by the lingam and his consort Parvati is depicted as Sundaranayagi. The presiding deity is revered in the 7th century Tamil Saiva canonical work, the Tevaram, written by Tamil saint poets known as the nayanars and classified as Paadal Petra Sthalam. The temples has several inscriptions dated to the period of Kulothunga Chola I (1070-1120 CE). The most important festival of the temple is the Chittirai Brahmotsavam that lasts ten days during the Tamil month of Chittirai, between April and May. The temple is maintained and administered by the Hindu Religious and Charitable Endowments Department of the Government of Tamil Nadu. Legend left The all-powerful Asuras, Tarakan, Kamalatchan and Vithvan Mali built palaces in gold, silver and iron respectively and were troubling the Devas more frequently. The Devas along with Vishu and Brahma worshipped Shiva. Shiva personified sky as the roof, ground as base, Surya & Chandra as Wheels, Four Vedas as horses, Merumalai as the Bow, Vasuki as the string and Thirumal himself as the arrow. Brahma was steering the Chariot. Vinaya grew angry as he was not a part of the war and broke the caster bolt of the chariot. Shiva gave good deeds to Vinayagar and went ahead winning the Asuras at Thirvathikai. Since the Achu (caster bolt) was broken into pieces (Pakkam), this place is called Achirupakkam. During Tripurasamharam, the killing of Tripurantaka, Shiva forgot to worship Ganesha before setting out for the battle. He realized it and came back to worship Ganesha and went ahead to win the demon. The same legend is associated with Thiruvathigai Veerattaneswarar Temple and Thiruvirkolam Sri Tripuranthaka Swami temple . As per another legend, sages Gautama and Kanva worshiped Shiva at this place. There is another legend which indicates that a Pandya king found a golden iguana which disappeared under a tree. While digging under the tree, he found a linga. He requested sage Trinedhrathari to build a temple who built two sanctums, one for Uamiyatchivarar and other for Aatcheesvarar. History Imitated amphorae have been found in the temple in many excavations in the same context of the imported variety. They are found to be used continuously in Tamil Nadu in 6-7th century mainly in Thondai mandalam, which flourished as a prominent political centre under the Pallavas after the Sangam period.Kalpav·πõk·π£a: essays on art, architecture and archaeology.D. Dayalan The inscriptions are dated to the period of Kulothunga Chola I (1070-1120 CE) where Shiva is referred as Accukkontu Aruliya Tevar. The inscriptions talk of generic contributions of land, gold and sheep to the temple. Architecture  Acharapakkam is located on the 79th km of Trichy-Chennai National Highway (NH45) and 10 km from Maduranthakam. Acharapakkam has its own railhead on the Trichy-Chennai railway line. The temple covers an area of around . The temple has a five tiered raja gopuram and a tank in front of it. All the shrines of the temple are enshrined in concentric rectangular walls, with the shrine of Aksheeswaraswamy being the most prominent. The sanctum is set axial to the flagstaff and gopuram. The image of the consort, Sundaranayaki is enshrined in a west facing shrine. There are images of Saraswati, Lakshmi, Saptamatrika and Ayyappa in the first precinct around the sanctum. It is believed that there was a well in front of the sanctum, which can be seen during the times of monsoon even during modern times. The sculptural representation of Karaikkal Ammaiyar walking with her hands and the hunter Kannapa Nayanar sculpted under the image of Somaskanda are noteworthy. Worship and festivals thumb The temple priests perform the pooja (rituals) during festivals and on a daily basis. Like other Shiva temples of Tamil Nadu, the priests belong to the Shaivaite community, a Brahmin sub-caste. The temple rituals are performed four times a day; Ushathkalam at 6:30 a.m., Ucchikalam at 10:00 a.m., Sayarakshai at 6:00 p.m., and Ardha Jamam at 10:00 p.m. Each ritual comprises four steps: abhishekam (sacred bath), alankaram (decoration), naivedyam (food offering) and deepa aradhanai (waving of lamps) for the pedestal of Ekambareswarar. Since it is a Lingam made of sand mound, all the ablution is done only to the pedestal. The worship is held amidst music with nagaswaram (pipe instrument) and tavil (percussion instrument), religious instructions in the Vedas read by priests and prostration by worshippers in front of the temple mast. There are weekly rituals like somavaram and shukravaram, fortnightly rituals like pradosham and monthly festivals like amavasai (new moon day), kiruthigai or on krittika nakshatram, pournami (full moon day) and chaturthi. The temple celebrates many festivals throughout the year. The most important of these is the Chittirai Brahmotsavam that lasts ten days during the Tamil month of Chittirai, between April and May. There are various processions during the ten days with the festive images of presiding deities of the temple carried in various mounts around the streets of the temple.

History Reform Outreach was first proposed by Rabbi Alexander M. Schindler, then president of the Union of American Hebrew Congregations (UAHC), the congregational arm of Reform Judaism in North America, at a meeting of the organization's Board of Trustees on December 2, 1978 in Houston, Texas. Deploring the rising rate of intermarriage, which he regarded as a threat to Jewish survival, Rabbi Schindler urged reform congregations to intensify their educational programs and to do \\"everything possible to draw into Jewish life the non-Jewish spouse of a mixed marriage.\\" Reform Judaism magazine, Fall 1989, page 22 Rabbi Schindler further called on the Reform Movement \\"to launch a carefully conceived Outreach Program aimed at all Americans who are unchurched and who are seeking roots in religion.\\" He envisioned a \\"dignified and responsible approach\\" aimed at \\"those reared in non-religious homes or those who have become disillusioned with their taught beliefs, the seekers after truth who require a religion which...encourages all questions, and...who need the warmth and comfort of a people will known for its close family ties and of an ancient, noble lineage.\\"Reform Judaism magazine, Fall 1989, page 23 Concerned about a possible Christian backlash, Rabbi Balfour Brickner, then director of the UAHC's Department of Interreligious Affairs, sent a letter to thirty-one prominent Protestant and Catholic clergy asking for their reactions to Rabbi Schindler's proposal to reassert Judaism's missionary legacy. The eighteen who responded reportedly \\"applauded Schindler's initiative as an affirmation of American religious pluralism, but several cautioned that a missionary drive might embolden Christian groups that target Jews for conversion.\\" Reform Judaism magazine, Spring 1994, page 18 The strongest criticism came from within the Jewish community. Rabbi Moshe Sherer, then president of Agudath Israel of America (Orthodox) called Reform Outreach to non-Jews \\"a further step to undermine the identity and continuity of the Jewish people.\\" Rabbi Ismar Schorsch, then chancellor of the Jewish Theological Seminary of America (Conservative), complained, \\"At a time when...Jewish financial resources are stretched even thinner, it borders on the incredulous to hear of a proposal to put serious money into bringing Judaism to the non-Jewish world.\\" Jack Wertheimer, professor of history, Jewish Theological Seminary of America, warned, \\"The Jewish community may pay dearly for Reform's bid at proselytizing. Bold pronouncements about missionizing are like a red flag waved in front of a charging bull.\\" Reform Judaism magazine, Spring 1994, page 15 Though Orthodox, Rabbi Emanuel Rackman, then president of Bar Ilan University, was amenable to Rabbi Schindler's Outreach proposals: \\"To stem the tide of intermarriage today, our present attitude [aversion to conversions and converts] is as helpful as aspirin is for cancer...We need not engage in missionary activity; but when a positive attitude regarding conversion is likely to do more to insure the future of the Jewish people than a negative attitude, we must act accordingly.\\" Reform Judaism magazine, Spring 1994, page 15 In 1979, the UAHC's General Assembly adopted an Outreach resolution in line with Rabbi Schindler's proposals, making the welcoming of Jews-by-choice an organizational priority. In partnership with the Central Conference of American Rabbis, the rabbinical arm of the Reform Movement, the UAHC established the Commission on Reform Jewish Outreach to oversee Outreach programming. The principal educational Outreach avenues are Introduction to Judaism, a 16- to 20-week course in partnership with local congregations, and A Taste of Judaism, a free 3-session class for Jews or people from different faith backgrounds who are interested in learning the basics of Judaism with an eye toward possible conversion. According to an Outreach survey of 429 men and women who had completed Introduction to Judaism courses in 1983-1984, 78% of the non-Jews had either converted to Judaism or planned to convert, and some 90% of all those enrolled said they intended to raise their children as Jews.Reform Judaism magazine, Fall 1999, page 32 Addressing the UAHC General Assembly in 1989, Rabbi Schindler declared Outreach \\"the single innovation in present-day Reform Judaism for which I would like to be remembered.\\" In the same speech, he broadened the Outreach principle by calling for full inclusion of gay and lesbian Jews in synagogue life. \\"In all of this,\\" he said, \\"I am working to make the Reform Jewish community a home: a place where loneliness and suffering and exile end...\\" Reform Judaism magazine, Fall 1999, page 32 Rabbi Schindler's successor as UAHC president, Rabbi Eric Yoffie, continued to champion Outreach. \\"In the absence of Outreach,\\" he said, \\"tens of thousands of intermarried couples who are now members of our congregations would have been forever lost to the Jewish people.\\" As Rabbi Schindler had done before him, Rabbi Yoffie encouraged Reform Jews to ask, but not pressure, non-Jews already part of Reform congregational life to consider converting to Judaism.Reform Judaism magazine, Fall 1999, page 32 Rabbi Richard Jacobs, the current president of the Union for Reform Judaism, also affirmed Outreach. \\"We practice Outreach,\\" he told delegates at the 2013 URJ Biennial,\\"because it is good for the Jewish people.\\" Focusing on the next generation, Rabbi Jacobs urged Reform congregations to practice what he termed \\"audacious hospitality,\\" because \\"the majority of [millennials] will be the children of intermarriages, and potentially our leaders.\\" Jewish Week, January 14, 2014 Audacious Hospitality is now among the URJ's three top priorities, along with strengthening congregations and tikkun olam (healing the world).

As much as he reminisced about the old days, Cole wanted Francesca out of his life, mostly to protect his marriage to Caitlin Deschanel. However, it was then when Francesca decided to play the game her way. At the time, she was married to Phillip Vargas, but it seemed like her marriage was everything but peaceful. During that storyline, her husband was killed, and Francesca, without having anything to do, decided to move to Sunset Beach to pursue her old love and new opportunities. However, it was obvious nobody actually liked her. Francesca always did things the wrong way. She constantly blackmailed people with evidence she collected to get what she wanted. She found a tape of Gabi Martinez and Father Antonio Torres having sex in an exploding building, and blackmailed them with it. She was, at the time, involved in the Rosario Jewels storyline. Also, the tension between Francesca and Caitlin was rising. Cole tried to convince Francesca to leave Sunset Beach various times, but she always refused the deal. Even A.J. Deschanel, who tried to convince her to do what's right, couldn't get through to her. Francesca, who also learned about various other plots, soon became everyone's enemy. She even became an ally of Gregory Richards, Caitlin's father. In March 1999, Francesca was shot at and ended up in a hospital (after jumping out a cake wounded). However, she couldn't gain enough strength to confess about who murdered her. On her way to Hell, Francesca was greeted by Del Douglas and Eddie Connors, also murder victims. It was later revealed that Francesca was murdered by Gregory.

It contained a mixture of news items, feature articles, and expert commentary. The website is still active, giving free online access to issues May 2010 through July-August 2019, and offering for sale back issues from January-February 2001 through May 2010 (most still in stock) (order forms broken). History Australasian Science was Australia's longest-running scientific publication. It was first published in 1938 as The Australian Journal of Science by the Australian National Research Council, which was the forerunner of the Australian Academy of Science. In 1954 the journal was transferred to ANZAAS ‚Äì the Australian and New Zealand Association for the Advancement of Science, and published as Search. Throughout this time the journal published the research of eminent Australian scientists, including Sir Douglas Mawson and Sir Frank Macfarlane Burnet, whose groundbreaking clonal selection theory was published in the journal in 1957. The journal evolved considerably over the following decades, with ownership transferring from ANZAAS to Blackwell Science in the 1980s and finally to Control Publications in 1992. In 1998 Search merged with Australasian Science Mag, a quarterly science magazine published by the University of Southern Queensland, and the merged entity was published as simply Australasian Science. Published by Control Publications and available in newsagents, it was the only magazine dedicated to Australian and New Zealand science. Australasian Science Patrons in this time were Nobel Laureate Prof Peter C. Doherty and ABC broadcaster Robyn Williams. Issues Magazine (last issue 2014) merged into Australasian Science. Australasian Science ceased production following publication of the July/August 2019 edition. Description It contained a mixture of news items, feature articles, and expert commentary.

It is the first opera to be written, composed and produced in Australia. Quote from the opera's title page: :The plot is taken and many scenes are literal translations from Casimir Delavigne's celebrated comedy of \\"Don John of Austria\\" (Don Juan d'Autriche). Performance history It premiered on 3 May 1847 at the Royal Victoria Theatre, Sydney and enjoyed a successful run of six performances. It has been produced only twice since: two performances (12 and 14 September 1997) at Spitalfields, London, by Spitalfields Market Opera with The Chelsea Opera Group directed by Philip Parr and conducted by Alexander Briger, and semi-staged performances on 18 and 20 October 2007in two actsat the City Recital Hall, Angel Place, Sydney, also conducted by Briger. Nathan's original orchestration has been lost and Nathan's great-great-great grandson, the conductor Sir Charles Mackerras, created a new orchestration. Alexander Briger is a nephew of Mackerras, and Nathan's great-great-great-great grandson. Synopsis Nathan‚Äôs fast-paced opera tells of the rivalry in love of Philip II of Spain and his illegitimate half-brother Don John. The libretto follows Delavigne's 1835 Don Juan d'Autriche fairly closely, except for the addition of a scene near the end with Agnes alone, where she sings \\"They tell us that a home of light there is, where praying seraphs glow\\". In fact the opera's plot is in many ways an inversion of Fromental Hal√©vy's opera La Juive (libretto by Eug√®ne Scribe). In the latter, the male lover is precluded from having an affair with his inamorata because she is Jewish, whilst he is a high-born Christian; later it turns out that she was Christian all along, but all ends tragically. In Don John, in a similar situation, it turns out that the 'high-born Christian' is in fact of Jewish descent, and all ends happily.

The film, which was originally titled Scraps, starred and was produced by Mary Pickford, who was the most powerful woman in Hollywood at the time.Wood, Bret \\"Sparrows (1926)\\" (article) TCM.comMankiewicz, Ben. Intro to Turner Classic Movies presentation ofSparrows (May 5, 2010) Plot Mr. Grimes and his wife operate a dismal \\"baby farm\\" near an alligator-infested swamp. Molly, an adolescent inmate and the oldest of their charges, attempts to provide the other tattered, starving kids with the loving maternal care they need. Most of the children are orphans. One mother sends her child a doll, but Grimes crushes its head and tosses it into the swamp. The children are ordered to hide any time someone comes to the farm. When a hog buyer shows up, Ambrose, the Grimeses' son, maliciously prevents Splutters, one of the children, from hiding. The buyer then purchases the boy from Grimes. Molly has promised the others that God will rescue them. When a boy asks why nothing has happened after a month, she tells him that He is busy attending to sparrows (a biblical reference). Ambrose catches Molly with stolen potatoes, so she and the others are given no supper. She pleads for the children, especially the sick, youngest baby, to no avail. Late that night, in a vision, Christ enters the barn where they sleep and takes the baby. When Molly wakes up, the child is dead. Joe Bailey and his associate bring a kidnapped baby girl to the farm for concealment until they receive a ransom from the rich father, Dennis Wayne. When Grimes reads about the kidnapping in the newspaper several days later, he decides it is safer to chuck the baby into the swamp. When Ambrose grabs the little girl to carry out the plan, Molly gets her back. After she fights off Grimes with a pitchfork, he strands her in the hayloft and decides he must get rid of her, too. That night, Molly flees with the children. Grimes finds this hilarious; he figures either the mud or the alligators will take care of the children. However, when the kidnappers come back for the baby, he leads them on a search. Meanwhile, Splutters is brought to the police station, having been discovered by one of the search parties. He tells the policemen and Mr. Wayne about the baby farm. Molly and the kids emerge unscathed from the swamp and hide aboard a boat, unaware it belongs to the kidnappers. Pursued by the police, Grimes runs into the swamp, but falls into deep mud and perishes, while the two criminals flee in the boat. Unable to shake the harbor patrol, they try to slip away in a dinghy, but are run over and drown. The baby is reunited with her wealthy father, but when she refuses to drink her milk without Molly, Mr. Wayne offers Molly a comfortable home. She accepts only on condition that he take in the other children as well.

After that, Pickford did some talking pictures before retiring to \\"Pickfair\\", her estate with husband Douglas Fairbanks.Landazuri, Margarita. \\"Sparrows (1926)\\" (article) TCM.com Production Although William Beaudine received critical acclaim both inside and outside the film industry for his direction, star Mary Pickford felt that he was too cavalier about the safety of the actors, especially in a scene where she had to carry a baby across some water filled with alligators. Pickford wanted to use a doll, but Beaudine insisted on using a real baby, since the alligators' jaws were bound shut. However, Hal Mohr, the film's director of photography, debunked this story, saying \\"There wasn't an alligator within ten miles of Miss Pickford,\\" and revealing in precise detail how the effect was done. Regardless, Pickford swore that Beaudine would never work for her or her company as long as she lived. She was as good as her word: he never worked for her or United Artists again. Toward the end of the picture, they clashed so often that Beaudine developed a serious paralysis of his face from the pressure and aggravation. He finally turned the picture over to his assistant, Tom McNamara, and left the set. McNamara finished the picture uncredited. Art director Harry Oliver transformed of the back lot between Willoughby Avenue and Alta Vista Street into a stylized Gothic swamp. The ground was scraped bare in places, 600 trees were carted in, and pits dug and filled with a mixture of burned cork, sawdust and muddy water. Filming began in July, over summer vacation. The children had the run of the set, barefoot and in costume, so they would become accustomed to the environment. Each child had a crew member assigned to fish them out of the gunk. These assistants also made sure the kids were cleaned up and comfortable with warm towels when they emerged from the swampy water. Pickford developed a great fondness for two-year-old Mary Louise Miller. Pickford, who had no children of her own, even tried to adopt the toddler, but her parents refused. An earlier version of the \\"Jesus in the barn\\" scene was filmed in which the dead baby's spirit was carried to Heaven by a phosphorescent angel. The scene was rejected in favor of the Jesus take. Critical reception *The New York Times: \\"Gustav von Seyffertitz, with a suspicion of Lon Chaney's penchant for deformity, is emphatically capable as Mr. Grimes. Little as she does, Charlotte Minneau gives an excellent portrait of the cruel and unimaginative Mrs. Grimes. ... Although Miss Pickford's performance is as flawless as ever, it is doubtful whether she served herself well in selecting this special screen story, in which there is an abundance of exaggerated suspense and a number of puerile ideas. It is an obvious heartstring tugger during most of its length, and it frequently dallies with the thrills of old fashioned melodramas.\\" * Motion Picture Magazine, December 1925: \\"It was Douglas Fairbanks who told us that Mary Pickford's production of \\"Sparrows\\" was Dickensonian. And after seeing it we have nothing less and nothing more to say of it. Perhaps you know that it is the story of a baby farm . . . with Gustav von Seyffertitz as Grimes, the cruel manager . . . and Mary, as Mollie, who watches over the little boys and girls. Melodrama is interwoven in the story and there is nothing new or startling about the plot. But you won't realize this until the last lovely close-up of Mary has faded from the screen. Which means, of course, that the story interests you so much that your critical faculty is dulled. We are glad that Mary is not going to continue to play grown-ups parts. So many on the screen can be the grand lady. And no one else that we have ever heard about or seen captures the elusive and misty quality of childhood as Mary does. You'll weep a little. You'll laugh a great deal. And you'll hold your breath once or twice.\\" * Picture Play, January 1927: \\"The choice of \\"Sparrows\\" was a singular one for Mary Pickford to make, but no one can deny that she has done the picture surpassingly well. The subject is gloomy, and some of the horrors recall Dickens, yet the darkness is shot through with many laughs. Indeed, so heavily does the hand of melodrama smite \\"Sparrows\\" that the picture passes beyond the bounds of credibility. Thus the spectator relaxes, content to give way to his amazement at Mary's skill. She is Mama Mollie, a lovely waif in whom the maternal instinct is well, there aren't words to tell how strong it is, for she mothers eleven woebegone, poverty-stricken children at a baby farm kept by the villainous Grimes in the midst of a Louisiana swamp. A kidnapped baby is thrust by Grimes into the group and the plot gets underway, Mollie's heroic efforts to keep the baby against the will of Grimes leading her and the entire brood into the deadly swamp. \\"Sparrows\\" is well worth seeing.\\" * Film historian Jeffrey Vance considers Sparrows to be Pickford's masterpiece. In his program notes for the Giorante del Cinema Muto (also knows as the Pordenone Silent Film Festival,) Vance writes in 2008: ‚ÄúSparrows is her most fully realized and timeless work of art.

The police force has a manpower of approximately 77,000, and is responsible for enforcing criminal- and traffic law, enhancing public safety, maintaining order and keeping the peace throughout Sri Lanka. The professional head of the police is the Inspector General of Police who reports to the Minister of Law and Order as well as the National Police Commission. The current Inspector General of Police is Pujith Jayasundara. During the Sri Lankan civil war, the police service became an integral part of maintaining of the nation's security, primarily focusing on internal security. Many police officers have been killed in the line of duty mainly due to terrorist attacks. At the same time, the police ( and military ) were accused of being corrupt or being too heavy handed. https://www.sangam.org/2010/08/Welikade_Massacre.php?uid=4028 independence day parade Specially trained commando/counter-terrorist units named Special Task Force are regularly deployed in joint operations with the armed forces for counter-terrorism operations and VVIP protection. The police command structure in Northern and Eastern provinces is closely integrated with the other security organisations under the authority of the Joint Operations Command. The Police service is reached islandwide on the 119 emergency number.

History Seal of the Ceylon Police Force 1797: The office of Fiscal was created. Fredric Barron Mylius was appointed as Fiscal of Colombo and entrusted with responsibility of policing the City of Colombo. 1806: The regulation No. 6 of 1806 appointed a Vidane Arachchi to each village, for prevention and detection of crime in rural areas. 1832: A committee appointed by the governor was instructed to form a police force. It was decided by this committee that the new police force was to be funded by a tax to be paid by the public. It consisted of one Superintendent, one Chief Constable, five Constables, ten Sergeants and 150 Peons. They were responsible for maintaining law and order in the capital city of Colombo. 1844: As the police force was restricted to coastal areas only, a second police force was created to cater to the hill country. 1858: The police force in the coastal area and the police force in the hill country were unified. 1864: The first death of a police officer whilst on duty occurred when he attempted to apprehend a brigand by the name of \\"Saradiel\\", who was subsequently compared to Robin Hood. 1865: The Police Ordinance was enacted to stipulate the powers and responsibilities of policemen. 1866: William Robert Campbell, then the chief of police in the Indian province of Rathnageri, was appointed as Chief Superintendent of Police in Ceylon on 3 September 1866. This date is considered as the beginning of the Sri Lanka Police Service. 1867: The Chief of Police was designated as the Inspector General of Police. William Robert Campbell became the first Inspector General of Police. The Police Headquarters was founded at Maradana, in the City of Colombo. 1870: Muslim rioters attacked the Police Headquarters.

This year, the Criminal Investigations Department (CID) was formed. 1879: The strength of the police force had tripled from 585 when IGP Campbell was appointed, to a force of 1528. The first police firing range, training college and the publishing of the annual administration report emerged during this year. 1892: The Depot Police presently known as the Field Force Headquarters was formed. Uniforms and housing were made free for police officers. The payment of a Good Conduct Allowance was initiated. 1908: Fingerprinting and photographing of criminals were initiated, along with the direct recruitment to the rank of Assistant Superintendents of Police. 1913: Herbert Layard Dowbiggin was appointed as the 8th Inspector General of Police. 119 police stations were in operation with a total strength of 2306. 1915: For the first time two officers were appointed as Deputy Inspectors General of Police. 1916: 0.22-caliber rifles were issued in place of shotguns. 1920: For the first time, police officers were deployed for the purpose of controlling traffic. 1923: A book containing comprehensive details regarding all aspects of the police, the Departmental Order Book, was formulated. 1926: The Sport Division was established. 1930: A handbook of traffic rules and regulations was issued for traffic duties. 1932: The Police Headquarters was moved from Maradana to its present location in Colombo Fort. 1938: Police telephone boxes were deployed throughout the city of Colombo. 1942: Temporary forces were employed, known as Temporary Police Constables. 1945: - Police units were deployed at all hospitals. Additional units were also deployed for railway security. However, in the following year, the railway police force was discontinued as a necessity for it did not arise. 1952: Women were enrolled to the police force for the first time. VHF radios were introduced for communication. It was decided that in honour of police officers killed in the line of duty, state funerals with full police honours would be held. In addition the police flag would be flown at half mast throughout the country. 1954: Police stations were graded into five classifications, Grades \\"E\\" to \\"A\\". The grading of police stations was considered depending on the workload, population, locality, crimes, important institutions, etc., in the area. 1963: Divisions in the police were made as North, Central, South, Administration, and Criminal Investigation Departmenta. D. B. I. P. S.

Organisation The Sri Lanka Police is headed by the Inspector General of Police, who has, in theory, autonomy to commanding the service from the Police Headquarters in Colombo, and support by the Police Field Force Headquarters. However, in the recent past the Police Service has come under the purview of the Ministry of Defence (MoD), with the exception of several years when it came under the Ministry of Internal Affairs but was transferred to the MoD. In the last few years there have been calls to reestablish the independent National Police Commission to oversee transfers and promotions, thereby making the service autonomous and free from any influence. The police service is organised into five primary geographic commands, known as ranges (Range I, II, III, IV, V), covering the northern, western, eastern and southern sectors of the island under the command of a Senior Deputy Inspector General of Police (SDIG). The ranges were subdivided into divisions, districts, and police stations; Colombo was designated as a special range. Each police division headed by a Deputy Inspector General of Police (DIG) covers a single province, and a police district headed by a Senior Superintendent of Police (SSP) covers a single district of the country. In 1974 there were a total of 260 police stations throughout the country. As of 2007 there were more than 2,000. With the escalation of the Sri Lankan Civil War the strength and the number of stations have increased. Since 1971 the police service has suffered large number of casualties, with officers and constables killed and wounded as a result of terrorists and insurgents. In more remote rural areas beyond the immediate range of existing police stations, enforcement of simple crimes are carried out by the Grama Seva Niladhari (village service officers), but this has now become rare, with most villages covered by new police stations. In addition to its regular forces, the police service operated a reserve contingent until 2007 when the Reserve Police Force was disbanded and its personnel transferred to the regular police force. The police service has a number of specialised units responsible for investigative, protective, counter-terrorism and paramilitary functions. Investigation of organised criminal activity and detective work are handled by the Criminal Investigation Department (CID) under the command of a Deputy Inspector General of Police (DIG). More coordinated threats to internal security, such as that posed by the radical Sinhalese JVP in the 1980s, were the responsibility of the Counter Subversive Division, which was primarily an investigative division, and which has since been replaced by the Terrorist Investigation Department (TID). The TID carries out counter-terrorism investigations and threats to internal security from the LTTE. Protective security units which are entrusted the security includes the Ministerial Security Division (elected public figures), Diplomatic Security Division (foreign diplomats) and Judicial Security Division (judges). The President's Security Division and the Prime Minister's Security Division function independently but consist of mostly police personnel. Other specialised units includes the Information Technology Division, the Mounted Division, the Anti-riot Squad, Traffic Police, K9 units, the Marine Division, the Police Narcotic Bureau, and the Children & Women Bureau. The police service also operates the Sri Lanka Police College of personnel training and the Police Hospital. ;Special Task Force Special Task Force is one of the special operational units in the Police Service. This police paramilitary force was set up on 1 March 1983 with the assistance of foreign advisers (primarily former British Special Air Service personnel under the auspices of Keeny Meeny Services). Its 1,100-member force was organised into seven companies and trained in counterinsurgency techniques. It played a major role in the government's combined force operations against the Tamil Tigers in Eastern Province before July 1987. Following the signing of the Indo-Sri Lankan Accord, the Special Task Force was redesignated the Police Special Force, and deployed in the Southern Province, where it immediately went into action against the JVP terrorists. Companies of the force also served in rotation as part of the presidential security guard. ;Internal intelligence Until 1984 the police were responsible for national (local) intelligence functions, first under the Special Branch (est. 1966 as part of the CID), and later under the Intelligence Services Division. The perceived failure of the Intelligence Services Division during the riots of July 1983 led the J.R. Jayawardene government to reevaluate the nation's intelligence network, and in 1984 the president set up a National Intelligence Bureau. The new organisation combined intelligence units from the army, navy, air force, and police. It was headed by a deputy inspector general of police who reported directly to the Ministry of Defence. =Specialised units and divisions= ;Protective units *President's Security Division *Prime Minister's Security Division *Ministerial Security Division *Parliament Police Division *Judicial Security Division *Diplomatic Security Division ;Counter-terrorist units *Special Task Force (STF) *Terrorist Investigation Division (TID) ;Crime-investigation units *Criminal Investigation Department (CID) *Colombo Crime Division *Police Narcotic Bureau *Financial Crimes Investigation Division (FCID) *Children & Women Bureau *Disappearances Division *Human Rights Division ;Law enforcement *Traffic Police *Tourist Police * Anti-Riot Squad *Police Kennels (K9 units) *Ombudsman Division *Strategic Development Division (community policing) ;Support units *Mounted Division *Marine Division *Sri Lanka Police Academy *Police Examination Division *Police Hospital, Colombo ;Technology infrastructure *Police Information Technology Division *Police Communication Division *Police CCTV Division *Police Public Relations Division *Police Tell IGP Unit *Police 119 Call Center Peacekeeping and international deployments In recent years members of the Sri Lanka Police have taken part in international deployments either as advisers, observers or seconded police officers for United Nations missions.

Composition of the police service Since its establishment in the 19th century, the police service has been a centrally controlled national police force. Due to this, its personnel are not recruited and deployed provincially. During the colonial period much of its senior officers were British, with lower ranks made up of natives. However this composition did not mirror the racial composition of the island. Many of the locals in the Ceylon Police Force were Burghers, followed by Sinhalese and Tamils. This was common in the government sector and continued until the mid-1950s. Following political efforts to balance the racial composition of the police service to mirror that of society, and due to the civil war, the composition has become imbalanced once again, with the majority of the officers being Sinhalese. Currently steps are being taken to address this and personnel of all entry levels are recruited from all racial groups of the island. Uniforms =Historical= Ceylonese policeman in colonial uniform With the establishment of the Ceylon Police in 1866, standard uniforms based on the ones of the British police forces were adapted. Officers of the grade of Inspector and above who were mostly British wore white colonial uniforms, which are still used today for ceremonial occasions. Constables wore dark blue tunics, shorts and a black round cap with a collar number. Khaki uniforms were adopted by the beginning of the 20th century for practical reasons, along with other military and police units of the British Empire. This was common for all ranks, with the constables wearing khaki tunics, shorts and hat, while always armed with a baton until 1974. =Current= Standard traffic police uniform Special Task Force personnel in DPM camouflage and armed with MP5s during a parade in 2012 The current standard uniform comes from the last major changes made in 1974. However, several additions have been made since then for practical reasons. The old white uniform still remain as the full-dress uniform of Officers above the rank of sub inspector SI, only worn for ceremonial occasions. This includes white tunic, trousers (or skirt), and medals, and is adorned with black epaulettes with rank insignia, a black leather cross belt with the lion head badge with whistle and chain, police badge-affixed black leather pouch, sword, and a white pith helmet. Gazetted officers - ASP, and above ranks may wear a waist sash in gold colour instead of the cross belt. Mounted officers wear a red tunic for ceremonial occasions with a gold cross belt and a black custodian helmet. Officers above the rank of sub inspector - SI, carry swords, and constables carry lances with a police pennant. The No.01 khaki uniform is worn for most formal occasions. This consists of a khaki jacket adorned with black epaulettes (Officers above the rank of sub inspector - SI), white shirt, black tie with khaki trousers or a skirt, black peaked cap and medals. The No.02 khaki uniform is the normal working uniform of all police officers. It consists of a khaki shirt (long or short sleeved), khaki trousers or a skirt, black peaked cap, and medals ribbons. Gazetted officers of and above the grade of superintendent wear black \\"gorget patches\\" on all types of uniforms. Officers above the rank of sub inspector SI, tend to wear a short sleeve tunic like a \\"bush jacket\\" as part of their No.02 khaki uniform. Black sam browne belts are worn by Officers above the rank of sub inspector - SI, with traffic policemen wearing white peak caps and the white belt with sam browne belts on their khaki uniforms. Constables and sergeants wear their service numbers on their uniforms. For practical reasons overalls of green or black may be worn with boots when necessary. Special Task Force personnel usually wear khaki uniforms which are slightly lighter in colour. They tend to wear DPM camouflage uniforms with boots and bright green berets. Awards and decorations The Sri Lanka Police has its own awards and decorations that are awarded to its officers for services in the line of duty. Weapons Sri Lanka Police officers normally don't carry weapons (but are advised to) . The Special Task Force with its wide range of duties is equipped with a greater variety of firearms and a higher degree of firepower to carry out military type counter-terrorism operations.

Justice Lance Wright claims that it perhaps was the first court of its type in the world.Transcript, 1 May 2002, Lance Wright, ‚ÄúThe Centenary of the NSW Industrial Relations Commission‚Äù ‚Äì ABC Radio http://www.abc.net.au/rn/perspective/stories/2002/542681.htm The court was unique at that time as it was the first court of its type to deal with labour relations between employer and employees on a compulsory basis.Vol 16-6: Trade Unionism and the New Protection Dr Geoffrey Partington Previous arbitration measures between employer and employee had been on a voluntary basis or had been based on the criminal justice system through the use of criminal penalties. The conventional economic model is that both employer and employee enjoy equal bargaining power to set wages and conditions.Ross Gittins, Sydney Morning Herald. http://www.smh.com.au/news/business/work-choices-blue-is- class-warfare/2007/05/06/1178390141294.html This asserts that both parties are able to agree on a fair market price for the cost of labour free from distortions. However, where employers or employees group together, these outcomes can be distorted particularly in ‚Äúboom‚Äù or ‚Äúbust‚Äù economic conditions. The purpose of the court was to change the manner in which employers and employees negotiated pay and conditions. It was an attempt to reduce the power imbalances between employer groups or employee unions that arose from using collective bargaining, and the resulting use of that market power to influence wages, and also to reduce the threat of lockout or strikes to achieve those ends. Background Regulation of employment in the early nineteenth century was simply based on the common law concepts of contract. These concepts provided that an employer and employee were free to bargain as the nature and the terms of employment. Where either party breached the contract, there was recourse to the law in the normal courts of the land. This could prove to be an expensive exercise and a lengthy one as well. It was also possible under various ‚ÄúMaster and Servant Acts‚Äù for employees who broke employment contracts to be prosecuted for a breach of the criminal law. In this situation, either the employer or employee could be fined or imprisoned . Dr Geoffrey Partington outlines an example in 1858 where German masons who were brought to Australia to work on the Victorian railways, broke their contracts after being persuaded to work for another employer. This was due to a shortage in the supply of experienced masons in Australia. The masons were imprisoned as a result of their breach.Partington. A maritime strike in 1890 led to the introduction in 1892 of the Trades Dispute Conciliation and Arbitration Act 1892 (NSW).Medium neutral citation is used in this article for the citation of NSW laws. See Medium Neutral Citation guidelines at Austlii, http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/other/CompLRes/1999/1/4.html This Act provided the first legislated non-common law arbitration scheme for disputes between employers and employees. The new law required the agreement of both employer and employee to engage in conciliation or arbitration. However, a declining labour market meant that employers were not prepared to accept arbitration and Patmore Patmore 2003a, pp. 7‚Äì11 reports that only two of twenty two cases under that law were settled. Unions found the legislation ineffective in getting employers to the bargaining table. Disillusionment with the system led to a royal commission.Pearce In 1899 a new law made under the Conciliation and Arbitration Act 1899 (NSW) which gave the Minister for Labour of the New South Wales Government the power to mediate any industrial dispute. However, this also failed because employers were not legally bound to follow the directions of the Minister. In proposing change, Bernard Wise said: ‚ÄúI believe that those who have most experience of courts of law will be the first to admit that their machinery is unsuitable for dealing with these subjects. Not only are they overburdened with business ‚Äì and so there would be delay where urgency was of the utmost importance if we would prevent industrial warfare ‚Äì but their forms of procedure and their rules do not readily lend themselves to dealing with these delicate questions, half of fact or entirely of fact, that would have to be determined by the tribunal called upon to interpret an industrial agreement. It is not our judges who determine facts under our system, but our juries; and surely everyone will see that there would be a waste of time, a needless cost, and in the end a most unsatisfactory result, if it were necessary to refer on every occasion to a jury, or even to a bench of lawyers, the question whether or not an industrial agreement had been broken, or whether the altered conditions of a trade required the rate of wages to be lowered or raised.‚Äù. (NSW, Parliamentary Debates, Legislative Assembly, 28 June 1900, p 648 (Bernhard Wise)) Establishment of the court The failure of the previous systems led the New South Wales Government to introduce a new means of dealing with industrial disputes. Industrial disputes were now to be determined by compulsory arbitration in a court, and not through voluntary conciliation or through wage boards. The Court of Arbitration was established under the Industrial Arbitration Act 1901 (NSW), which came into force on 10 December 1901. Certain procedural matters had to be attended to before the court could formally sit. Once this was done, the court first sat on 16 May 1902.Patmore. http://www.australianreview.net/digest/2005/09/patmore.html The court was a court of record. The court was constituted by a president and two members. One of the members was to be an employer representative and the other an employee representative. The president had to be a judge of the Supreme Court of New South Wales. The first President of the Court was the Honourable Mr Justice Henry Cohen.Wright The Court had jurisdiction to hear and determine any industrial dispute or matter referred to it by an industrial union or the registrar of the court.State Archives The court could make decisions on wages and conditions even when both parties did not agree. This was to be made in the form of ‚Äúawards‚Äù. Industrial agreements could still be made voluntarily but now, they could also be registered with the court. Unions had to registered to participate in the court, and their registration possibly led to an increase in membership from 58,200 in 1902 to 68,600 in 1904. The new laws attracted international attention when it was claimed that they were ‚Äú\\"the most radical arbitration law in the world\\". Notable cases The first case heard by the court was a dispute between the Newcastle Wharf Laborers‚Äô Union and the Newcastle and Hunter River Steamship Company. The court found the employer guilty of locking out its employees and it was ordered that certain union members should be employed. The court also ordered the union to provide employees to the company, and in default, the company was able to use non- union labour. Other cases heard by the court included cases concerning the Cigar Makers' Union, the Tailoresses' Union, the Saddle and Harness Makers' Union, the New South Wales Clickers' Union, the Boot Operators' and Rough Stuff Cutters' Union, the Journeymen Coopers' Union and the Trolley Draymen and Carters' Union. Apprenticeships The court was the first court in Australia to regulate apprenticeships. Unions at the time usually advanced the argument in court that apprentice numbers should be restricted so that they could be properly trained. Heydon rejected this argument and considered that it was only a way of unions restricting the number of members in the industry. At the same time, Heydon required apprentices to attend proper trade classes to learn their trade. Unfortunately, wage rates weren‚Äôt regulated by the court, and this appears to have occurred because neither the unions nor the employers sought it.Stromback Appeals Section 32 of the Act provided that there was to be no right of appeal from the court.

This was in part due to the High Court‚Äôs decision in allowing decisions of the court to be challenged. Sexton refers to a speech by parliamentarian George Beeby where he said: ‚ÄúUnfortunately, the High Court, which, with all respect to the learned gentlemen that constitute it, is entirely out of touch with the industrial affairs of this country and out of sympathy with industrial unions, took a strict view of the law, and gave a certain judgment, whereas it could have given just as logical a judgment in favour of the trade- union that had the case before the court‚Äù.(NSW Parliamentary Debates, Legislative Assembly, 19 March 1908, 317-319 as cited in Sexton The Court of Arbitration in its short life had established a precedent for the regulation of apprenticeships which no other previous Australian court had done before.

The property is in the care of English Heritage but is managed by the local parish council. Blakeney is just off the A149 coast road and is nine miles west of Sheringham. The property can be found in an alley just off the quay. It is a scheduled monument. Origins The building has always traditionally been called the Guildhall but nothing is known of its early history. It is likely to have originally been built for a prosperous medieval Blakeney fish merchant, the undercroft being used for storage of his merchandise. The building later became the guildhall of Blakeney‚Äôs guild of fish merchants. The Guildhall was once a two-storey building but now all that remains is the 14th-century brick-vaulted undercroft. It is divided into two aisles by a row of stone piers which support the ribbed vaults of brickwork. The doorway and the windows are all original. The bricks, no doubt, were locally made and are typical of their period, being of variable shape, quality and appearance. For this reason brickwork of this period was often plastered over. The main building was entered from higher ground on the southern land side of the building. A projection at the south-east corner contains the shute that served a garderobe or privy. Ownership It is believed that the Guildhall was once owned by the Carmelite Friary that stood nearby. It has been in the ownership of the village for over 400 years. There is a series of deeds recording the transfer of ownership from one group of trustees to the next. Each deed provides for the Guildhall to be used for the benefit of the villagers of Blakeney. The first surviving deed dates from 1627. There are other similar deeds dated 1687, 1750 and 1808. Subsequent deeds do not appear to have survived. Over the years the basement has been used for the storage of cargo, as a grain store, coal bunker, for growing mushrooms and also a worm and bait store for local fishermen. During the war years the basement was used as a mortuary for drowned sailors.

Wild first joined Manchester City in 1920 as an assistant to Ernest Mangnall, primarily assisting in administrative matters. p241-3 Mangnall held the position of secretary-manager, meaning he was responsible for both on-field and off-field matters. Mangnall left the club in 1924, and the role was separated into two areas. David Ashworth was appointed as manager, with the responsibility of selecting the team and coaching, and Wild was appointed as secretary, taking responsibility for administration. Wild remained in this position until 1932, when the manager's position became vacant due to Peter Hodge leaving to become Leicester City manager. Wild took on the managerial role in addition to his existing secretarial duties. p212 In Wild's first season in charge Manchester City reached the 1933 FA Cup final, but lost 3‚Äì0 to a Dixie Dean inspired Everton. The following season Wild again led City to the final, this time emerging as 2‚Äì1 winners against Portsmouth. The 1933‚Äì34 season also saw Wild hand a debut to Frank Swift, who became the club's first choice goalkeeper for the next 16 years. The FA Cup success was accompanied by a fifth place League finish, and the two subsequent seasons also resulted in top half finishes. The consistency of the preceding seasons was built upon in 1936‚Äì37, though the season had an indifferent start in which the team won two of their opening ten matches. By the Christmas results had improved, and in the second half of the season Wild's side embarked on a remarkable unbeaten run, going without defeat in the 22 matches between 26 December and the end of the season. On 10 April City faced Arsenal, the dominant team of the 1930s, and won 2‚Äì0 to confirm their position as contenders for the championship.James, p47 A fortnight later City claimed a seventh consecutive win, beating Sheffield Wednesday 4‚Äì1, and became champions of England for the first time. The 1937‚Äì38 season was a marked departure from Wild's previous success. Despite playing an attacking style of football which resulted in City scoring more goals than any other club in the division, the season ended in relegation, the only time the reigning English champions have been relegated. Despite this setback Wild remained as manager, and the following season the club finished fifth in the Second Division. League football was then suspended following the outbreak of the Second World War. When competitive football resumed in 1946, Wild wished to step down as manager. On 2 December Sam Cowan was appointed manager and Wild returned to his former position as secretary. His fourteen years in charge make him the longest serving manager in the club's history. He remained club secretary until his death in 1950.

It was endemic to the Hawaiian islands of Molokai and Maui. It is only known from fossil remains and likely became extinct before the first Europeans visited Hawaii in 1778. Extinction Due to its early extinction, very little is known about this species. It is only known from a few bones found in caves. It appears that this species began to go extinct when the first Polynesians settlers came to the islands. They cleared some of the land for farming and introduced species for which the native birds had no defence. According to fossil records, their numbers declined rapidly in the early 12th century. It has been speculated that this species' visits to lower elevations was its undoing due to contact with avian diseases and pests. Today, only about sixty percent of Hawaii has not been drastically altered. Many avian diseases and parasites also pose a major threat to Hawai'i's native forest birds.

It is an erect, open, spindly shrub with sticky, short, serrated leaves and white to pink flowers and is only known from a few scattered populations. Description Eremophila brevifolia is an erect, open, spreading shrub with thin branches and which usually grows to a height of . The leaves are arranged alternately along the branches and are mostly long, wide, sticky, glabrous, broad egg-shaped to almost circular and have serrated or toothed margins. The flowers are usually borne singly in leaf axils on a straight stalk long. There are 5 narrow, pointed, green sepals which are long and mostly glabrous. The petals are long and joined at their lower end to form a tube. The tube is a shade of white to pale purple on the outside and white with yellow spots inside. The petal lobes are glabrous except for the lower lobe which is covered with long hairs near its base. The inside of the tube is also filled with long, soft hairs. There are 4 stamens which are enclosed in the petal tube. Flowering mostly occurs from July to September and is followed by fruits which are dry, oblong and long. Taxonomy and naming The species was first formally described by Friedrich Gottlieb Bartling in 1845 as Myoporum brevifolium and the description was published in Plantae Preissianae. In 1847, Alphonse de Candolle changed the name to Pseudopholidia brevifolia and in 1859, Ferdinand von Mueller changed it to Eremophila brevifolia. The specific epithet (brevifolia) is derived from the Latin words brevis meaning \\"short\\" and folia meaning \\"leaves\\". Distribution and habitat Eremophila brevifolia is only known from three small, scattered areas near Geraldton, Northampton and Kellerberrin in the Geraldton Sandplains, Avon Wheatbelt and Jarrah Forest biogeographic regions where it grows near rivers. Conservation status Eremophila brevifolia is classified as \\"Priority Two\\" by the Western Australian Government Department of Parks and Wildlife meaning that it is poorly known and from only one or a few locations. Use in horticulture The small, delicate white flowers of this species contrast with its bright, glossy green leaves. It is a hardy plant, resistant to frost and to drought. It is easily propagated from cuttings and will grow in a range of soils and aspects, including partial shade.

Life and career McClintic was born in Seattle, attended Washington University and New York's American Academy of Dramatic Arts, and became an actor, but soon became a stage manager and casting director for major Broadway producer Winthrop Ames. His Broadway directorial debut was on A. A. Milne's The Dover Road. McClintic's first major success was on The Barretts of Wimpole Street featuring his wife, the American actress Katharine Cornell, in 1931. He also directed Hamlet featuring John Gielgud in New York in 1936. Katharine Cornell served on the Board of Directors of The Rehearsal Club, a place where young actresses could stay while looking for work in the theatre. McClintic sometimes found roles for the young women in his plays. In what may have been lavender marriages, gay McClintic was married: firstly to actress Estelle Winwood, and then, for forty years, to actress Katharine Cornell - herself a lesbian. After they were married, they formed a production team M.C. & C Company, which produced all the plays for the rest of his life. He directed every play that Cornell starred in, including Romeo and Juliet, Candida, Antony and Cleopatra, No Time for Comedy, Antigone, St. Joan, The Doctor's Dilemma, Three Sisters, and There Shall Be No Night, and The Constant Wife. Their production company brought over many of the leading Shakespearean actors of the day, giving them their first prominent Broadway roles, including John Gielgud, Ralph Richardson, Maurice Evans, and Laurence Olivier. McClintic died of cancer on October 29, 1961, in New York City. His widow retired from acting shortly after his death, her last role being in Jerome Kilty's dramatization of Dear Liar in 1961.

JOKES, A/K/A Jorge Yanes is a Cuban American filmmaker most known for creating music videos films and his contributions to urban Latin television.  Early life  Yanes was first exposed to film making in his early teens while attending a magnet school art program for disadvantaged youths. In those years, he began to explore the discipline of writing screenplays as well as performance and camera angles alongside fellow creative classmates Gabe Alberro (of Rap group UBNAWKSHIS) and J.Bishop. It was in those years that Jorge (known then as Cam) became a graffiti artist with particular stance towards making characters and pieces known as \\"burners\\". Yanes attended Miami Dade College film program, at Miami Dade College, Jokes created the film short FATSACKS, a dark comedy experimental starring J.Bishop. The short inspired a follow up short titled IF JIMMY WAS ABRAHAM AND GOD WALKED WITH HIM sometimes known as ...IF JIMMY. Jokes was offered an opportunity to co-write a low budget indie street film Real Hustla. He eventually managed to also DP and Edit the film, which was nationally distributed straight to video by Maverick entertainment.  FILMMAKING  In 2001, Jokes was hired to produce a music video TV show titled Upbeat for a brand new Latin youth network called MUN2. The show soon went from meager ratings to become the leading ratings‚Äô winner for the network. Its success inspired the network to take on a bilingual format; the show was retitled THE ROOF, the flagship two-hour nightly live event for the network. Serving as creative director and co-creator, THE ROOF became an international hit in the Latin urban music world and is credited with exposing Latin hip hop and reggaetton to the international community. JOKES then decided it was time to direct his own music videos and shape the genre in his vision. Bringing a fresh yet authentic savvy style to his work, he became a sought-after talent in the mainstream market. His keen ability to work with new artists and make them look like pros attracted many mainstream stars of today, such as T-Pain and Tila Tequilla, to begin their careers with a video directed by JOKES. In 2006, Love & Suicide the controversial anti Cuban embargo independent feature film was released in theaters; he served as co editor and music supervisor as well as being part of the creative core of the film. In 2006, JOKES directed the music video ‚ÄúGroundhog Day‚Äù for the band MAYDAY!, and upon upload to the newly launched site YouTube, it quickly rose to become one of the Internets most heavily viewed videos, receiving just under 3 million views in two days. What soon resulted was heavy media attention from outlets like the New York Times, E! Entertainment and ABC World News Tonight. After working with various high profile clients and developing short film musicals for a few notable talents, JOKES decided it was time to grow once again and began to pursue the narrative world of film making. In 2007, ‚ÄúOOHWEE‚Äù, the T-Pain concert intro comedy film that featured T-Pain‚Äôs acting debut was written directed and edited by JOKES and premiered to over 4.5 million SCREAM TOUR concert attendees. In 2008, Jokes served as editor on the Latin TV mini series event ‚ÄúGabriel: Amor Immortal‚Äù, which was nominated for 8 Emmy‚Äôs, and was awarded the Emmy for best editing. JOKES has now turned his attention to feature film directing and has released his first drama, VLADIMIR‚ÄôS VODKA, a short film based on characters from his feature film script, ‚ÄúEenie Meenie Miney Moe‚Äù.

Of the four species in the genus Rhodacanthis, the scissor-billed koa finch and the primitive koa finch became extinct before the arrival of the first Europeans to Hawaii in 1778. It was endemic to the islands of Maui and Kauai in the Hawaiian Islands.  Diet  The scissor-billed koa finch was a granivore, that, like the other members of its genus, had a bill adapted to eat the hard seeds and pods of legumes. Pollen and fossil evidence indicates that Ka palupalu o Kanaloa (Kanaloa kahoolawensis) and koaia (Acacia koaia) were probably important food sources, and it may have eaten caterpillars and aalii (Dodonaea viscosa) berries.  Extinction  Due to its early extinction, very little is known about this species. It is only known from fossil remains. Other Hawaiian honeycreepers are known to have become extinct or very rare due to habitat loss, introduced predators and avian diseases. It is possible the extinction of the scissor- billed koa finch also involved these factors.

He made more than 350 appearances in the Football League, played for Birmingham City in the 1960 Inter-Cities Fairs Cup Final, and won four caps for the England under-23 team. Life and career Neal was born in Dinnington, which was then in the West Riding of Yorkshire. He came through Wolverhampton Wanderers' nursery club, Wath Wanderers, and then joined the junior ranks at the club. He turned professional in 1951, but failed to break through to the first team. In 1954, he moved to Second Division club Lincoln City, where he played more than 100 league games. While at Lincoln he was first capped for England under-23, and remains the only player to represent England above youth level while at the club. Financial difficulties caused in part by falling attendances forced Lincoln to accept the substantial offer of ¬£15,000 plus player Bert Linnecor from First Division club Birmingham City, and in April 1957 Neal moved on. He was a powerful player, both strong in the tackle and capable of positive attacking play; manager Arthur Turner brought him in as a replacement for Len Boyd, who had retired through injury after the 1956 FA Cup Final. He made nearly 200 appearances in all competitions for Birmingham, including 165 top- flight League matches and the 1960 Fairs Cup Final, and captained the side in 1960‚Äì61. The next season, he lost his place to Terry Hennessey, so moved to Middlesbrough, where injury restricted his appearances during the two seasons he spent there. He returned to Lincoln, now in the Fourth Division, as captain for another year. He went on to try his hand at management, as player-manager of several non-league clubs in the Staffordshire area, before going into the licensed trade. He ran a pub in Penkridge for nearly 20 years. In 2006, to celebrate their centenary in the Football League, Lincoln City fans voted for \\"100 League Legends\\", those 100 players who had represented the club with most distinction; Neal came in at number 42. Neal was married to Barbara and had three children, Debbie, Richard and Tim. He died in 2013 at the age of 79.

Life =Early life= Born in Saint Petersburg or Moscow, he was the second surviving son of Count Nikolai Nikitich Demidov and Baroness Elisabeta Alexandrovna Stroganova. He grew up in Paris, where his father was ambassador. He served briefly as a diplomat himself in Paris (living in the h√¥tel built by Charles de Wailly for the sculptor Augustin Pajou, at 87 rue de la P√©pini√®re, now the rue La Bo√©tie), Rome and Venice. Upon his father's death in 1828, Anatole settled for good in western Europe, returning to Russia as little as possible. This attitude alienated him from tsar Nicholas I of Russia, who always had an antipathy towards him. =Scholarly endeavours= In 1837‚Äì38, he organised a scientific expedition of 22 scholars, writers and artists (of which Auguste Raffet and the critic Jules Janin became Demidov's friends) to southern Russia and the Crimea, headed up by Fr√©d√©ric Le Play. It cost 500,000 francs and its results were published as Voyage dans la Russie m√©ridionale et la Crim√©e (4 vol., 1840‚Äì1842), with 100 original lithographs by Raffet and dedicated to the tsar despite his not having taken any interest in the book (irritated as he was that most of the expedition's members had been French). Demidov also financed a trip to Russia by Andr√© Durand in order to identify landscapes, which were published under the title Voyage pittoresque et arch√©ologique en Russie (1839). In 1840, Demidov himself published a series of articles on Russia in the Journal des D√©bats ‚Äì these were collected as Lettres sur l‚ÄôEmpire de Russie (1840) with the aim of fighting certain received French ideas about Russia. Nevertheless, these works irritated Nicholas I due to their description of Russia's feudal system. In 1847 Demidov made a trip to Spain with Raffet, publishing an account of it later as Etapes maritimes sur les c√¥tes d‚ÄôEspagne (1858). In 1842, he was elected a foreign member of the Royal Swedish Academy of Sciences. =Art collector= Anatol Demidov Mathilde Bonaparte He also considerably expanded the Demidov collection assembled by his father at the Villa San Donato near Florence, being particularly interested in Romantic art. In the Paris Salon of 1834 he acquired Paul Delaroche's The Execution of Lady Jane Grey (now in the National Gallery, London). In 1833, he bought Fran√ßois Marius Granet's The Death of Poussin, which caused a sensation at the 1834 Salon. He commissioned paintings from Eug√®ne Delacroix and watercolours from Richard Parkes Bonington and Th√©odore G√©ricault, as well as Briullov's The Last Day of Pompeii. His collection was split up in public sales in Paris in 1863 and shortly before the prince's death in 1870. =Marriage and separation= Like his parents, Demidov was a great admirer of Napoleon I of France. He built a museum below the house of San Martino on Elba, where Napoleon had lived during his first exile, and he caused a mass to be sung at Portoferraio every 5th of May (which is still sung today). In 1839, he was introduced by Jules Janin into the circle of J√©r√¥me Bonaparte, former king of Westphalia, who was living in exile at the Villa di Quarto in Florence. A plan to marry J√©r√¥me's daughter princess Mathilde- L√©tizia Bonaparte to Demidov was quickly formed. It was agreed that she would receive a dowry of 50,000 francs in jewels (bought by Demidov for 1 million francs from J√©r√¥me, always short of money) and 240,000 francs in money, payable in instalments. A decree of 20 October 1840 also made Demidov the Prince of San Donato to allow the princess to hold onto her title, though Demidov's princely title was never recognised in Russia. The marriage took place in Rome or Florence on 1 November 1840. In March 1841, the couple went to Saint Petersburg, where the Tsar was full of attention for his cousin (through the W√ºrttembergs) the princess and losing no opportunity to humiliate Demidov by any means possible. In spite of this, Anatole began his own infidelities. On 17 August 1841, the couple arrived in Paris, where they lived at h√¥tel Demidoff at 109 rue Saint-Dominique until June 1842, when they moved to spend a year in Saint Petersburg before finally setting up home at the Villa San Donato. Their relationship soon soured, with the princess taking Count √âmilien de Nieuwerkerke as a lover, and Demidov taking Valentine de Sainte-Aldegonde, duchesse de Dino, as a mistress. Mathilde made a violent scene with Valentine during a ball and in reply Demidov slapped her twice in public. Separated since 1843, in September 1846 Mathilde fled to Paris to take refuge with Nieuwerkerke, taking with her the jewels from her dowry. Even so, Demidov was condemned by a tribunal in Saint Petersburg to send Mathilde an annual pension of 200,000 francs and was never able to recover his jewels. In many ways, Demidov felt he deserved such punishment, and their separation was authorised in 1847 by a personal decision of tsar Nicholas I. Demidov's many other mistresses included Maria Calergis, considered one of the most beautiful women of her era, Ernestine Duverger, and Fanny de la Rochefoucauld (daughter of Francois, 8th duc de la Rochefoucauld, with whom he had an illegitimate son). =Later life= Demidov tried to repair the damage the separation had done to his social standing by increasing his charitable donations. He created hospitals, orphanages and started an international committee to aid prisoners of the Crimean War, as well as giving 1 million roubles to finance that war (for which Alexander II of Russia made him chamberlain and councillor of state). In 1860, he, the duc de Morny and doctor Oliffe made up the consortium of investors which founded the bathing resort at Deauville, and he took part in the famous Carnival de Paris (a painting at the mus√©e Carnavalet shows his team taking part). A bon viveur, two chicken dishes were named after him, including Chicken Demidoff (elaborately stuffed, smothered, tied up and garnished), and the Demidoff name is also applied to dishes of rissoles and red snapper. He died in 1870 of a pulmonary congestion in his hotel on rue Saint-Dominique in Paris. Dying without legitimate issue, his title of Prince of San Donato passed to his nephew Pavel Pavlovitch Demidov.

The first one was built in 1616, as the fourth of six Wignacourt towers, and collapsed in around 1715. The second was a Tour- reduit, which was built in 1720 and demolished in 1915. Both towers formed part of a chain of fortifications built to defend Marsalforn and nearby bays from Ottoman or Barbary attacks. Although the area was fortified by several towers, batteries, redoubts and entrenchments, the only surviving vestige of these is Qolla l-Bajda Battery between Qbajjar and Xwejni Bays. First tower The first tower, which was also known as Xagƒßra Tower (), was the fourth of the Wignacourt towers. Construction started in around 1614 or 1615, and the tower was completed in 1616. The tower commanded Marsalforn Bay to the west, and Ramla Bay to the east, effectively guarding the northern approach to Gozo. It was clearly visible from the northern walls of the Cittadella, so it could communicate directly with the garrison there. Its design was attributed to the military engineer Giovanni Rinaldini. This tower was probably not financed by Wignacourt like the other towers, but by the Order itself, and the cost of building it is not known. The tower's design is completely different from the other Wignacourt towers, since it did not have any turrets. It had a square base, and roughly the same size as the Wignacourt Tower in St. Paul's Bay. The tower was built on the edge of a cliff, which was prone to erosion. In 1681, it was briefly abandoned after part of the cliff face collapsed. The Order still kept a garrison in the tower, but further damage was sustained in the 1693 Sicily earthquake, when cracks on the cliff face extended to beneath the tower. The Order sent an engineer to inspect the damage, but he believed that the tower would remain standing for at least another century. Despite this, new cracks developed by 1701, and plans were made to abandon the tower and build a new one to replace it. Marsalforn Tower was still in operation in 1715, when Philippe de Vend√¥me visited it and was greeted with a five-gun salute by the tower's Castellan, Domenico Azzupardi. The tower disappears from military records after this visit, and is believed to have collapsed or was dismantled later in 1715 or 1716. The only ruins of the tower visible today is a mound of rubble at the edge of the cliff face. Second tower The second Marsalforn Tower was built in the centre of the tal-Qortin plateau some time after the first tower had collapsed. Construction is believed to have begun sometime in 1720, and the tower was first mentioned on official records on 10 May 1722, when it was complete but it was still lacking its door and drawbridge. and it was designed by the military engineer Charles Fran√ßois de Mondion. A chapel was also located in the tower. The only known photograph of the tower was taken by the photographer Michele Farrugia in around 1910. By this time, the tower was partially in ruins, and part of the central vedette had already collapsed. This tower was demolished by the British military in 1915, and a wireless station was built in its place. The station was pulled down four years later in 1919. Some foundations of the tower are still reportedly visible.

The verse was first printed in Lyrical Ballads, 1800, a volume of Wordsworth's and Samuel Taylor Coleridge's poems that marked a climacteric in the English Romantic movement. The poem is the best known of Wordsworth's series of five works which comprise his \\"Lucy\\" series, and was a favorite amongst early readers.Jones, 4. It was composed both as a meditation on his own feelings of loneliness and loss, and as an ode to the beauty and dignity of an idealized woman who lived unnoticed by all others except by the poet himself. The title line implies Lucy lived unknown and remote, both physically and intellectually. The poet's subject's isolated sensitivity expresses a characteristic aspect of Romantic expectations of the human, and especially of the poet's, condition. According to the literary critic Kenneth Ober, the poem describes the \\"growth, perfection, and death\\" of Lucy.Ober, Kenneth; Ober, Warren. \\"Samuil Marshak's Translations Wordsworth's \\"Lucy\\" Poems\\". Germano-Slavica, January 2005. Whether Wordsworth has declared his love for her is left ambivalent, and even whether she had been aware of the poet's affection is unsaid. However the poet's feelings remain unrequited, and his final verse reveals that the subject of his affections has died alone. Lucy's \\"untrodden ways\\" are symbolic to the poet of both her physical isolation and the unknown details of her mind and life. In the poem, Wordsworth is concerned not so much with his observation of Lucy, but with his experience when reflecting on her death.Slakey, 629. Structure and style William Wordsworth, author of \\"She Dwelt among the Untrodden Ways\\" \\"She dwelt among the untrodden ways\\" consists of three quatrains, and describes Lucy who lives in solitude near the source of the River Dove.Wordsworth knew three rivers of that name; in Derbyshire, Yorkshire and Westmorland, but each could equally be the setting for the verse. In order to convey the dignity and unaffected flowerlike naturalness of his subject, Wordsworth uses simple language, mainly words of one syllable. In the opening quatrain, he describes the isolated and untouched area where Lucy lived, while her innocence is explored in the second, during which her beauty is compared to that of a hidden flower. The final stanza laments Lucy's early and lonesome death, which only he notices. Throughout the poem, sadness and ecstasy are intertwined, emphasised by the exclamation marks in the second and third verses. The effectiveness of the concluding line in the concluding stanza has divided critics and has variously been described as \\"a masterstroke of understatement\\" and overtly sentimental. Wordsworth's voice remains largely muted, and he was equally silent about the poem and series throughout his life. This fact was often mentioned by 19th century critics, however they disagreed as to its value. A critic, writing in 1851, remarked on the poem's \\"deep but subdued and silent devour.\\"\\"Poetry, Sacred and Profane\\". Nottinghamshire Guardian, October 30, 1853. This is written with an economy and spareness intended to capture the simplicity the poet sees in Lucy. Lucy's femininity is described in the verse in girlish terms, a fact that has drawn criticism from some critics that see a female icon, in the words of John Woolford \\"represented in Lucy by condemning her to death while denying her the actual or symbolic fulfillment of maternity\\". To evoke the \\"loveliness of body and spirit\\", a pair of complementary but opposite images are employed in the second stanza: a solitary violet, unseen and hidden, and Venus, emblem of love, and the first star of evening, public and visible to all. Wondering which Lucy most resembled--the violet or the star--the critic Cleanth Brooks concluded that although Wordsworth likely viewed her as \\"the single star, completely dominating [his] world, not arrogantly like the sun, but sweetly and modestly\\". Brooks considered the metaphor only vaguely relevant, and a conventional and anomalous complement.Brooks, Cleanth, 729-741. For Wordsworth, Lucy's appeal is closer to the violet and lies in her seclusion, and her perceived affinity with nature.Woolford, John. \\"Robert Browning, Christina Rossetti and the Wordsworthian Scene of Writing\\". Wordsworth Circle 34.1, 2003. Wordsworth purchased a copy of Thomas Percy's collection of British ballad material \\"Reliques of Ancient English Poetry\\" in Hamburg a few months before he began to compose the Lucy series. The influence of traditional English folk ballad is evident in the meter, rhythm, and structure of the poem. She Dwelt among the Untrodden Ways follows the variant ballad stanza a4‚Äîb3‚Äîa4 b3, and in keeping with ballad tradition seeks to tell its story in a dramatic manner.Durrant, Geoffrey. \\"William Wordsworth\\". Cambridge: Cambridge University Press, 1969. 61. As the critic Kenneth Ober observed, \\"To confuse the mode of the 'Lucy' poems with that of the love lyric is to overlook their structure, in which, as in the traditional ballad, a story is told as boldly and briefly as possible.\\" Ober compares the opening lines of She Dwelt among the Untrodden Ways to the traditional ballad Katharine Jaffray and notes the similarities in rhythm and structure, as well as in theme and imagery: There livd a lass in yonder dale, And doun in yonder glen, O. And Katherine Jaffray was her name, Well known by many men, O. According to the critic Carl Woodring, \\"She Dwelt\\" can also be read as an elegy. He views the poem and the Lucy series in general as elegiac \\"in the sense of sober meditation on death or a subject related to death\\", and that they have \\"the economy and the general air of epitaphs in the Greek Anthology ... if all elegies are mitigations of death, the Lucy poems are also meditations on simple beauty, by distance made more sweet and by death preserved in distance\\".Woodring, 44, 48. One passage was originally intended for the poem \\"Michael\\"‚Äì\\"Renew'd their search begun where from Dove Crag / Ill home for bird so gentle / they look'd down / On Deep-dale Head, and Brothers-water\\".Hartman 1934, 134‚Äì42 Lucy Wordsworth wrote his series of \\"Lucy\\" poems during a stay with his sister Dorothy in Hamburg, Germany, between October 1798 and April 1801.Rolfe, i. The real life identity of Lucy has never been identified, and it is probable that she was not modeled on any one historical person.Murray, 85. Wordsworth himself never addressed the matter of her persona, and was reticent about commenting on the series. Although a great detail is known of the circumstances and details of Wordsworth's life, from the time he spend during of his stay in Germany comparatively little record survives. Only one known mention from the poet that references the series survives, and that mentions the series only, and not any of the individual verses.Jones, 6. The literary historian Kenneth Johnson concluded that Lucy was created as the personification of Wordsworth's muse, > and the group as a whole is a series of invocations to a Muse feared dead. > As epitaphs, they are not sad, a very inadequate word to describe them, but > breathlessly, almost aware of what such a loss would mean to the speaker: > 'oh, the difference to me!'Johnson, 463. Writing in the mid-19th century, Thomas De Quincey said that Wordsworth, > always preserved a mysterious silence on the subject of that 'Lucy', > repeatedly alluded to or apostrophised in his poems, and I have heard, from > gossiping people about Hawkshead, some snatches of tragic story, which, > after all, might be an idle semi-fable, improved out of slight > materials.Davies, Hugh Sykes. \\"Lake Reminiscences\\". 247. Pencil drawing of William's sister Dorothy Wordsworth in later life. Lucy's identity has been the subject of much speculation,Abrams, M.H. The Norton Anthology of English Literature: Volume 2A, \\"The Romantic Period\\". (7th ed.). New York: W. W. Norton & Company, 2000. and some have guessed that the poems are an attempt by Wordsworth to voice his affection for Dorothy;Coleridge was the first to raise the possibility that Lucy may represent Dorothy this line of thought reasoning that the poems dramatise Wordsworth's feelings of grief for her inevitable death. Soon after the series was completed, Coleridge wrote, \\"Some months ago Wordsworth transmitted to me a most sublime Epitaph / whether it had any reality, I cannot say. - Most probably, in some gloomier moment he had fancied the moment in which his Sister might die.\\"Johnson, 464. Reflecting on the importance and relevance of Lucy's identity, the 19th- century literary critic Frederic Myers said, \\"Here it was that the memory of some emotion prompted the lines on Lucy. Of the history of that emotion, he has told us nothing; I forbear, therefore, to inquire concerning it, or even to speculate. That it was to the poet's honour, I do not doubt; but who ever learned such secrets rightly? Or who should wish to learn? It is best to leave the sanctuary of all hearts inviolate, and to respect the reserve not only of the living but of the dead. Of these poems, almost alone, Wordsworth in his autobiographical notes has said nothing whatever.\\"Myers, Frederic William Henry. \\"Wordsworth\\". Project Gutenberg. 33. Retrieved on 7 October 2007. According to Karl Kroeber, :Wordsworth's Lucy possesses a double existence, her actual, historical existence and her idealised existence in the poet's mind. The latter is created out of the former but neither an abstraction nor a conceptualisation, because the idealised Lucy is at least as \\"concrete\\" as the actual Lucy. In the poem, Lucy is both actual and idealised, but her actuality is relevant only insofar as it makes manifest the signifiance implicit in the actual girl.Kroeber, 106-107. Lucy is thought by others to represent his childhood friend Peggy Hutchinson, with whom he was in love before her early death in 1796--Wordsworth later married Peggy's sister, Mary.Cavendish, Richard. \\"Death of Dorothy Wordsworth: January 25th, 1855\\". History Today, January 2005. 55. Place among the 'Lucy' series Wordsworth established himself, according to the critic Norman Lacey, as a 'poet of nature' in his volume Lyrical Ballads in which \\"She Dwelt\\" first appeared.Lacey, 1. Early works, such as Tintern Abbey, can be seen as an ode to his experience of nature (though he preferred to avoid this interpretation), or as a lyrical meditation on the fundamental character of the natural world. Wordsworth later recalled that as a youth nature once stirred in him, \\"an appetite, a feeling and a love\\", but by the time he wrote \\"Lyrical Ballads\\", it evoked \\"the still sad music of humanity\\".Lacey, 3. The five 'Lucy' poems are often interpreted as representing both his apposing views of nature and a meditation on natural cycle of life.Jones, 190. \\"Strange fits\\" presents \\"Kind Nature's gentlest boon\\", \\"Three years\\" its duality, and \\"A slumber\\", according to the American literary critic Cleanth Brooks, the clutter of natural object.Brooks, 736. In Jones view, \\"She dwelt\\", along with \\"I travelled\\", represents its \\"rustication and disappearance\\". Parodies \\"She dwelt..\\" has been parodied numerous times since it was first published. In part, parodies of earlier works were intended to remark on the simplification of textual complexities and deliberate ambiguities in poetry, and on the way many 19th-century critics sought to establish a 'definitive' reasonings. According to Jones, such parodies sought to comment in a \\"meta-critical\\" manner, and to present an alternative mode of criticism to the then mainstream mode.Jones, 95 Among the more notable are those by Hartley Coleridge (\\"A Bard whom there were none to praise, / And very few to read\\") in 1834, and Samuel Butler's 1888 murder- mystery reading of the poem. Butler believed Wordsworth's use of the phrase \\"the difference to me!\\" was overtly terse, and remarked that the poet was \\"most careful not to explain the nature of the difference which the death of Lucy will occasion him to be ... The superficial reader takes it that he is very sorry she was dead ... but he has not said this.\\" These parodies were intended to question definitive interpretation of the verse, and highlight its indeterminacies.Davies, Damien Walford. \\"Lucy's Trodden Ways\\".

The John Wallace Trust continues to support young people in the Thornhill area by offering bursaries to help with the cost of higher education. Until the early nineteen seventies there were two secondary schools in the local area: the six-year Wallace Hall Academy at Closeburn and the four-year Morton Academy at Thornhill. In 1972 the two schools amalgamated and the new school at Thornhill became known as Wallace Hall Academy. Prior to this amalgamation an extensive building programme was started in 1970 and completed in 1978 in order to accommodate the pupils of both schools. The school continued to flourish on this site until, as part of Dumfries and Galloway Council's ¬£100 million project to build nine new schools within the region, a new Wallace Hall Academy was built over the road beside the original school playing fields.

White (November 5, 1961 August 17, 1985) was a United States Army soldier who defected to North Korea on August 28, 1982.NORTH KOREA SAYS G.I. SEEKS ASYLUM, New York Times, August 29, 1982 Life and career Born to Norval and Kathleen White, he had four siblings and volunteered for the 1980 Reagan presidential campaign before he could vote. In 1979, he attended a YMCA model legislature and introduced a 'bill' requiring 11 months of reserve military service for all 18-year-old males. He was also a member of the Boy Scouts and volunteered at a muscular dystrophy camp. In 1980, he introduced another bill in the model legislature that called for Missouri to withdraw from the union, and a list of \\"present abuses and injustices\\" of the federal government. Rejected by West Point, he intended to join the Army directly but was persuaded by his parents to attend Kemper Military School in Boonville, Missouri. The school commandant remembered White as an introvert and a loner. White subsequently dropped out of school and enlisted in the Army as an infantryman. After completing basic and advanced individual training, White was assigned to 1st Battalion, 31st Infantry Regiment in South Korea. At around 2 a.m., on August 28, 1982, he shot the lock off one of the gates leading into the Korean Demilitarized Zone and was witnessed by fellow soldiers walking through the DMZ from Guard Post Ouellette, near Kaesong with a duffle bag full of documents he stole from the site including the layout of mines which were buried on the South Korean side of the DMZ. He surrendered to North Korean troops. He was the first American soldier to request asylum in North Korea since January 1965 and the fifth since the Korean War. North Korean authorities refused a request by UNC representatives to meet White and ask him about the reasons for his defection. North Korean authorities released a video of White, in which he denounced the United States' \\"corruptness, criminality, immorality, weakness, and hedonism,\\" affirming he had defected to demonstrate how \\"unjustifiable [it was] for the U.S. to send troops to South Korea\\", before leading a chant in homage to North Korean leader Kim Il Sung. Prior to White's defection, Charles Jenkins, in 1965, was the last U.S. soldier to cross the demilitarized zone into North Korea. Jenkins wrote in his memoirs that he never met White, but once saw him on state television at a press conference soon after the defection.The Reluctant Communist: My Desertion, Court-Martial, and Forty-Year Imprisonment in North Korea, Charles Robert Jenkins, Jim Frederick, University of California Press, 2009, page 116 He also wrote that plans were in the works for White to share housing with one of the other American defectors, but it eventually fell through. According to Jenkins' government minders, White suffered an epileptic seizure of some form and was left paralyzed. Following that, Jenkins heard nothing more about him. In February 1983, White's parents received a letter from their son, stating that he was happy in North Korea and working as an English teacher. In November 1985, his parents received a letter penned by a North Korean contact of White, stating that their son had died by drowning in the Ch'ongch'on River in August 1985, and his body was not recovered. A copy of the letter was released by Dick Gephardt, then a Congressman representing Missouri, in early 1986.

It is an example of Lombard Renaissance architecture. History Detail of the loggia. Photo by Paolo Monti, 1975. Fondo Paolo Monti, BEIC. The Villa was first built by the Mozzoni family in 1400 as a hunting lodge. Given its proximity to the Alps, the area teemed with wildlife. Bears were also present and an important event in the family lore is tied to an incident involving a bear attack. The Mozzoni family was a noble Milanese family which had retired to the area around Varese (documents attest to their presence in Arcisate and Induno first, and then in Bisuschio) after factional struggles between the Della Torre and the Visconti families and their allies. After the Visconti family was replaced by the Sforza, the Mozzoni allied with this new Milanese ruling family. In 1476, Duke Galeazzo Maria Sforza visited the Mozzoni for a hunters' outing.Ville e castelli d'Italia: Lombardia e laghi, second edition, by Luca Beltrami, Editors of Tecnografica, Milan, (1907), page 275. In that occasion, a large bear (the diary of a participant describes it as weighing 250 lbs or 114 kg) wounded three hunters and killed a dog. One of the wounded was Agostino Mozzoni. The Galeazzo Maria, grateful for the protection received against the bear, granted Agostino the exaction of taxes for the whole area of Varese, up to an established maximum. In 1580 the only inheritor of the family name, Angela Mozzoni, married Giovan Pietro Cicogna and founded the current branch of the family which resides in Bisuschio. The family still conserves the Villa in its original configuration, including the gardens. The gardens were commissioned by Ascanio Mozzoni in the late 16th century, who took ideas from other estates he visited in his travels. Carlo Cicogna Mozzoni expanded the garden works. The austere Villa facade transitions to a frescoed courtyard with images of hunters on horseback and country scenes. The interior walls are extensively frescoed by artists of the school of the Campi of Cremona,Luca Beltrami, page 276. breaking the rigid lines of the buildings themselves. The courtyard forms a U shape, bordering on the open side onto a terraced garden. In the 17th-century, the family added a long stairway of water in a garden adjacent to the house. This waterway is crowned at the top by a small temple, and leads, at the bottom, to a grotto with tunnels.Luca Beltrami, page 275-278.Official website References Category:Gardens in Lombardy Cicogna Mozzoni Category:Renaissance architecture in Lombardy ","title":"Villa Cicogna Mozzoni, Bisuschio"},{"id":"13615161","text":"Vivekanandan Version is one among the release versions of Akilam.

During Late antiquity and the Middle Ages, its supposed descendants had a profound influence on the neighboring West Central German dialects and, later, in the form of Standard German, on the German language as a whole.Friedrich Maurer (1942) Nordgermanen und Alemannen: Studien zur germanische und fr√ºhdeutschen Sprachgeschichte, Stammes- und Volkskunde, Strasbourg: H√ºnenburg.

Born in Tulbagh, Cape Colony, he was raised in Bethlehem, Orange Free State. He is best known as the driving force behind the formation of a military bicycle corps used by the Boer Army for scouting and relaying messages. Originally trained as a school teacher, he became a lawyer and notary with his own law firm in Krugersdorp, Transvaal Republic, and was made a Captain in the Boer Army when the Second Boer War began. During the war, he was put in charge of a significant scouting unit, the Theron se Verkenningskorps (TVK) (Theron Reconnaissance Corps). He fought at the Battle of Spion Kop and one of his most famous feats occurred at the Battle of Paardeberg. The British Commander in Chief, Lord Roberts, called Theron: \\"the hardest thorn in the flesh of the British advance\\", put a reward of ¬£1,000 on his head ‚Äì dead or alive ‚Äì and dispatched 4,000 soldiers to find and eliminate the TVK.

Second Boer War  Theron became a Boer Army Captain and was put in charge of organizing and leading the Boer Intelligence scouts, the Theron se Verkenningskorps (TVK) (Theron's Reconnaissance Corps). To save horses for combat, he developed the use of bicycles for despatch and reconnaissance. His 105 recruits were equipped with various items including revolvers, binoculars and sometimes light carbine. The TVK would watch British movements and study their tactics during battles. Reconnaissance missions became Theron's specialty. He was able to move through the land without being detected. As the war progressed, Theron and his men were moved closer to the Western front. The Boers, under the rule of Piet Cronje, were constantly skirmishing with British forces, and the TVK gained a reputation for destroying railway bridges. Lord Roberts labelled Theron \\"the chief thorn in the side of the British.\\". A bounty was put on his head for ¬£1,000 offered for his capture. Theron's most notable single action was in the Battle of Paardeberg, where on 25 February 1900, a Boer Gen. Piet Cronje and several thousand troops were surrounded by British forces. Outnumbered and losing the battle, Theron, acting as a messenger for the other primary Boer commander, sneaked through British lines to convey a plan for a breakout operation - and then sneaked through the lines a second time to bring back Cronje's reply. The TVK brought many Boer civilians and soldiers across the river safely into Boer territory, but in spite of Theron's efforts the planned operation failed and most of the Boer forces surrendered. After the British occupied parts of the Orange Free State in March 1900, Theron and the TVK became well known for the guerrilla campaign they conducted against the British Army. The TVK attacked trails and rail yards, ambushed and captured British soldiers and officers, blew up bridges, and freed captured Boer fighters from British prisons. On two separate occasions while scouting in the veldt in no-man's land, Theron came upon the British Army Chief of Scouts, the American Frederick Russell Burnham. Both times the two men exchanged fire, but only at a distance. In July 1900, the British dispatched a unit of 4,000 soldiers to find and eliminate the TVK. After one skirmish with this force on 19 July, Theron managed to evade his pursuers and continue raiding, but the TVK was always on the run. =Death= While scouting alone on a koppie at Gatsrand, about north of present-day Fochville, he encountered seven members of Marshall's Horse and was killed in action. According to the source, Daniel almost ran into the cavalry platoon, but he reacted and opened fire so swiftly that he nearly eliminated the entire squad of seven, killing three and maiming four. Unfortunately, his gunfire drew attention to the escorting artillery, and the field guns opened a barrage on the koppie that killed him. General de Wet remarked \\"Men as lovable or as valiant there might be, but where shall I find a man who combined so many virtues and good qualities in one person?\\"Marais, p.414 On 15 September 1900, the men of the TVK exhumed the body of their Commandant and reburied him in the family cemetery of the Pienaar family near Fochville. But on 10 March 1903, Theron's last will was carried out and his body was once again exhumed to be reburied next to that of his late fianc√©e Hannie Neethling on her father's farm Eikenhof on the Klip (Rock) River. Legacy Fort Schanskop, Pretoria, South Africa On 28 December 1907, Generals Louis Botha and Jan Smuts unveiled the Danie Theron Monument near Potchefstroom. On 9 September 1950, a monument was unveiled at the location where Danie Theron died (near the N12 road between Johannesburg, South Africa and Potchefstroom). The monument has the following symbolism: * the main body consists of 50 concrete rings, which represents the 50 years since September 1900 when Danie Theron died; and * a copper flame at the top of the structure represents the flame which burned in the hearts of Theron and his nation, in search of their freedom and independence. The monument was built by L. Fokkens (Pty) Ltd. according to plans of the architect Mr. Hillebrands (from Krugersdorp). Funds for the monument were collected by the Voortrekkers organisation. A new Danie Theron Monument was erected near the Union Building in Pretoria, South Africa on 6 March 2002, by the former South African President Nelson Mandela. In one of the very rare occasions where Mr. Mandela spoke Afrikaans in public, he said he valued the fighting spirit of Danie Theron, his honesty, bravery and his determination to do the right thing for his nation and his beliefs. Mr. Mandela said that the modern South Africa needs more Danie Therons in order to meet the challenges that lie ahead. One of the primary schools in Carletonville was named in honour of this Boer hero, i.e. Laer Gedenkskool Danie Theron. A smaller replica of the monument (found on the hill near Fochville) was also erected on the school grounds, near the main entrance. A Commando Combat School was established at Kimberley, South Africa on 1 November 1967 and in 1968 it was renamed the Danie Theron Combat School. South Africa's school of military intelligence is also named after Danie Theron. The Danie Theron Medal was instituted by South Africa in 1970. It is awarded for diligent service in the Territorial Reserve (officers only until 1975). The ribbon is green with 3 yellow stripes. During the Boer War, Danie Theron used the alias of Captain James Bond. This is probably where Ian Fleming, the writer of the British spy series got the idea. [Ian Flemming stated in an interview that James Bond was named after British ornithologist and author James Bond - the name being selected because it struck Flemming as \\"ordinary, but masculine\\". See Wiki article, \\"James Bond, fictional character\\"] His great-great-niece, Charlize Theron, is an Academy Award- winning actress.

LaSSI was developed at Merck & Co. and patented in 2007United States Patent: 7219020 by Richard Hull, Eugene Fluder, Suresh Singh, Robert Sheridan, Robert Nachbar and Simon Kearsley.  Overview  LaSSI is similar to LSA in that it involves the construction of an occurrence matrix from a corpus of items and the application of singular value decomposition to that matrix to derive latent features. What differs is that the occurrence matrix represents the frequency of two- and three-dimensional chemical descriptors (rather than natural language terms) found within a chemical database of chemical structures. This process derives latent chemical structure concepts that can be used to calculate chemical similarities and structure‚Äìactivity relationships for drug discovery.

It is known as the ancestor of all koa finches.  Description  An adult primitive koa finch was slender and had a total length of about . There was probably a small distinct difference between the sexes. Based on fossils, it is known that the adult primitive koa finch had a slightly curved, thick bill.  Distribution  Primitive koa finch fossils have been found on Maui and Oahu. It is believed that it inhabited lowland dry forests and savannas, where dominant plant species included ka palupalu o kanaloa (Kanaloa kahoolawensis), aalii (Dodonaea viscosa), loulu (Pritchardia spp.), and koaia (Acacia koaia). Unlike other species of Rhodacanthis, koa (Acacia koa) was not present in significant numbers in its habitat.  Diet  The primitive koa finch was a granivore, with a bill adapted to eat the hard seeds and pods of legumes, especially ka palupalu o kanaloa (Kanaloa kahoolawensis) and koaia (Acacia koaia).

It was operational by 1822, and ceased to be used after the 1850s. History Few details of the canal have survived, and the main source of information about it comes from a paper submitted to the Journal of the Royal Agricultural Society of England by Erasmus Galton, and published in 1845. The journal was chosen because the main purpose of the canal was the improvement of a peat bog, to provide agricultural land. In 1811, Samuel Galton Jr., a financier from Duddeston, in Birmingham, owned of peat bog in the parish of Meare, which formed part of Westhay Moor. The moor had been split up into tenements by an Act of Parliament in 1790, but most of it remained unimproved, and was only suitable for the cutting of turf, which was used as a fuel. Samuel Galton set out to improve his holding, and the project was managed by his agent, a Mr. Richard Hammett, who came from the village of Street. Hammett would later provide the initial survey of the Glastonbury Canal, and it was his notes that Erasmus Galton used to prepare his article. Local opinion was that such land could not be improved, because any top dressing of soil would soon sink below the peat, and the effort expended would be wasted. However, Galton believed that if the land was drained properly before top dressing began, loss of the soil did not occur, and the land remained improved. His process consisted of dividing the land into ridges, which were wide, and cutting ditches at both sides. Peat was moved from the edges of the ridge to its centre, and over a period of 4 to 5 years, the peat compressed, and the surface sank by around , but was firm enough to support cattle. The cost for this first stage was given as ¬£4 2s 6d (¬£4.12) per acre (¬£10.30 per ha). The River Brue provided a source of soil for top dressing, as rich soil was deposited on its banks after heavy rainfall. It is not known when construction of the canal began, as Galton makes no mention of it in his article, and costs for the whole project are shown starting in 1811. However, the first carriage of soil is shown in 1822, when passed along the canal, so it must have been finished by this time. The canal had been authorised by the Brue Drainage Act of 1801. It was about long and wide. The section which joined the River Brue was embanked on both sides, after which there was a small lock, which raised the level of the canal to allow it to cross the moor. It joined the North Drain at the far end, and continued a little further to service land being reclaimed on the north side of the drain. Erasmus Galton's map of 1845, showing the canal and the parts of Westhay Moor which were improved by top dressing with silt Galton states that after draining the land, the native bog plants were soon replaced by ferns. Once the top dressing was applied, the ferns died away, to be replaced by clover and meadow grass. All of this grew naturally, as no planting was done. The soil used was largely clay or marl, and was added to a depth of . Between 1811 and 1842, the last year shown in Galton's table, the cost of the project was ¬£4770 1s 10d (¬£4770.09), and a total of 27,540 cubic yards (21,055 m3, or approximately 33,000 tons) of soil had been moved along the canal to be deposited on the land. The boatmen were paid 7d. (3 pence) per cubic yard, for digging it out of the ground, boating it and landing it. Galton was ordered to repair the floodbanks near to the canal by the Commissioners of Sewers in 1830. It appears to have been little used from the 1850s, and it was abandoned in 1897, when the drainage authority constructed a wall across the channel, which included a tidal flap so that water could still discharge into the river at some states of the tide. It is now incorporated into the local drainage system. Galton's map shows three droves running parallel to the canal. To the west is Parson's Drove, and to the east are London Drove and Dagg's Lane Drove.Ordnance Survey, 1:25,000 map The area between London Drove and Dagg's Lane Drove was subsequently used for peat digging, and more recently has become the Westhay Moor National Nature Reserve. It is managed by the Somerset Wildlife Trust, and as well as open water and reedbeds, it contains a fragment of acid mire, the largest to have survived in the south west of England. The reserve covers and provides habitat for many varieties of birds, which includes millions of starlings between November and January.

It was completed in about 1767 and abandoned in 1904. The canal was part of a larger network of tub-boat canals, which were used for the transport of raw materials, particularly coal, limestone and ironstone, from the locations where they were mined to furnaces where the iron ore was processed. The canal was connected to the Wombridge Canal and the Shropshire Canal. History Lord Gower, the brother-in-law of the Duke of Bridgewater, who had pioneered the canal age with his Bridgewater Canal, was the owner of limestone quarries and coal mines in Shropshire. Recognising the potential of canals for the carriage of heavy goods, he formed the Earl Gower & Company in 1764, joining forces with two land agents, John and Thomas Gilbert. Together, they planned a private canal from Lord Gower's coal pits in Donnington Wood to the Wolverhampton to Newport Turnpike Road, (later the A41 road, but now bypassed), terminating at a wharf at Pave Lane, where the coal would be sold. Construction started in February 1765, and 30 men were employed to carry out the work. Wages varied between 3.5 old pence (1.67p) and 1 shilling (5p) per day, and the of the main line of the canal were completed by late 1767, with all construction finished by July 1768. There is some evidence that the mine was reached by navigable levels, which allowed the boats to reach the coal face. Lord Gower became the first Marquis of Stafford in 1786. The office passed to his son, George Leveson-Gower in 1803, and he became the Duke of Sutherland in 1833. Because both men had controlling interests in the canal, it was sometimes known as the Marquis of Stafford's Canal or the Duke of Sutherland's Canal, rather than the Donnington Wood Canal. The limestone quarries at Lilleshall were served by the Lilleshall Branch, which met the main canal at Hugh's Bridge. At this point it was about lower, and so a tunnel was built into the hill, with vertical shafts up to the main line. A pulley system enabled coal to be sent down to the lower level, for use in the production of agricultural lime, and limestone to be raised up to the top level, for use in the production of iron. This system had been replaced by an inclined plane by 1797, which was long and powered by a steam engine. The inclined plane was used to transfer tramway waggons loaded with cargo between the two levels, and was never used to carry boats. The Lilleshall Branch also ran to Pitchcroft limeworks, via a junction at Willmore Bridge. This section included two short arms, to other parts of the Lilleshall limeworks. The Pitchcroft limeworks were lower than the junction, and so seven locks were constructed to reach them. New furnaces were built at Donnington Wood in 1785, after which much of the limestone was transported to them, rather than transporting coal to Lilleshall. Connections to the Wombridge Canal were made in 1788, to the Shropshire Canal in 1790, both at Old Yard Junction, and in 1794, the Wombridge Canal became part of the Shrewsbury Canal. A new set of furnaces were built at Old Lodge, Donnington Wood in 1825, and a new arm was built to connect them to the main line of the canal. Steven's Water Engine Pit, c.1900 or c.1920, which supplied water to the canal until 1928, long after the mine had closed. One of the tub boats used on the canal can be seen in the foreground. The water supply for the canal came mostly from the Donnington Wood coal mines. There were a number of beam engines at the mines and at Muxton Bridge, which remained in operation until the late 1920s. Limekiln Pool and Willmer Pool supplied the water for the Lilleshall Branch. The area around Donnington Wood and Wrockwardine Wood saw extensive mining operations, with some 74 shafts sunk between 1818 and 1835. The Lilleshall Company recorded 15 operational pumping engines in 1870, raising water from depths of to , and producing 20,000 tons of water per month. Sites included Grange, Granville, Muxton Bridge and Waxhill. Steven's Pit, also known as Stephen's, was opened some time before 1830, and pumped water from . In 1870, its beam engine was powered by a cylinder. The engine operated until 6 February 1928, supplying water to the canal, and was scrapped soon afterwards. Once pumping ceased, the western end of the canal dried out. Traffic on the Lilleshall branch declined after 1844, when the Humber branch of the Shrewsbury Canal, with its network of tramways, provided the Lilleshall Company with a more direct connection to the canal network. With the closing of the Lilleshall limeworks in the 1870s, the Lilleshall branch ceased to be used, which resulted in the section to Pave Lane being used very little, and finally closing in 1882. The Old Lodge furnace arm ceased to be used in 1888 when the furnaces closed, and soon afterwards, part of the bed on the Pave Lane section was used for a carriage drive to Lilleshall Hall, then owned by the Duke of Sutherland, Gower's descendant. The final section of about was leased to the Lilleshall Company in the 1880s and continued to be used until it was abandoned in 1904. Context Tub-boats were approximately 20 ft by 6 ft 4 in (6.1 m x 1.9 m), and could carry up to 8 tonnes of cargo. They were usually marshalled into trains, pulled by a single horse. Trains could consist of up to twelve tub-boats, when laden with coal, which was one of the heavier cargos, and a train of twelve boats would hold around 60 tons of coal. When laden with less dense cargoes, such as limestone, a single horse could pull up to 20 tub-boats. When travelling along the canal, the boats were kept under control by a man on the towpath using a long pole. Route Little Hales Bridge crossed the bed of the canal, which is now part of the road to Lilleshall Hall The canal ran in an approximate south-west to north-east direction from Donnington Wood to Pave Lane. For most of its length, its course was close to the modern contour. The Lilleshall and Pitchcroft branches were to the north of the main line.Ordnance Survey, 1:25,000 map The location of the terminal basin at Pave Lane now lies beneath agricultural buildings which are part of Pave Lane Farm. After crossing fields, the bridge which carried Pitchcroft Lane over it still exists, with the canal bed and towpath clearly visible beneath. Part of the bed was used for a carriage drive to Lilleshall Hall, which is now one of five National Sports Centres, and the access road follows the same route. It passes through a cutting under Little Hales Bridge, which once carried a track from Little Hales Manor Farm over the canal. A little further on, the canal turned to the west while the drive continues southwards, and there is a section of canal bed in the woods which often contains water. After crossing more fields, the course can again be seen at Incline Plantation. A large basin is visible at the head of the incline, and a road, appropriately called The Incline, runs along the towpath to Hugh's Bridge, which carries a minor road over the canal. The canal then ran due south to the remains of Lilleshall Abbey, which it skirts to the east, turning to the south-east to cross under Lilyhurst Road at Abbey Bridge. Passing Abbey Farm, it then crossed more fields to arrive at the outskirts of Muxton. Parts of it are now within the boundaries of the golf course, and some parts here still hold water. It then runs along the edge of Granville Nature Reserve, and into Granville Country Park. The route is difficult to follow, as the area was also crossed by a number of railway lines, and has been landscaped to form the park. The Old Lodge basin with parts of the associated furnaces are located by the main road into the park, and some restoration work was carried out in 1988, which included rebuilding the wharf, removing trees, and dredging the basin. However, it is difficult to visualise the arm to the canal, because spoil from the mining has raised the ground level so much. Beyond the A4640 road, all traces of the canal have been obliterated by subsequent development. The terminal basin and the junction with the Wombridge Canal and the Shropshire Canal were close to the location of the modern Council Offices. The remains of the tunnel which served the vertical shafts from the main line of the canal prior to the building of the inclined plane in 1797 The Lilleshall Branch ran down an incline from near Hugh's Bridge, and its grassy slope is clearly visible. The basin at the bottom of the incline is now a pond, and the top of the tunnel which met the vertical shafts can still be seen. From the incline, the bed of the canal towards the Lilleshall Limeworks is clearly visible for most of its length. The southern portal of the bridge which carried Willmoor Lane over the canal is still visible below vegetation, although the northern parapet has been demolished, and the track widened by tipping rubble against the north portal. The branch to Pitchcroft Limeworks is not easily traceable, although the field boundaries mark its route for most of the way, and a section of the bed is visible by the cottages at Pitchcroft. There are some remains of the bridge, but the basin beyond the road has disappeared. Although the documentary sources all mention two branches from the Pitchcroft Branch to the Lilleshall Limeworks, only one is shown on the 1888 Ordnance Survey map. The main Lilleshall Branch is still shown as a canal, but the Pitchcroft Branch and its arm to the Lilleshall Limeworks are shown as disused. The location of three locks near to the junction can be seen, but the locations of the other four locks are not obvious by this date.Ordnance Survey, 1:2500 map, 1888 Points of interest Bibliography   =References= See also *Canals of Great Britain *History of the British canal system Category:Canals in Shropshire Category:Canals opened in 1767 Category:1767 establishments in England ","title":"Donnington Wood Canal"},{"id":"13615460","text":"A mia-mia is a temporary shelter made of bark, branches, leaves and grass used by some Indigenous Australians.

A puppet rabbit, and star of Gus Honeybun's Magic Birthdays, he achieved a longevity for a TV puppet second only to the Sooty characters.BBC - h2g2 - Gus Honeybun - Puppet The clips were filmed at Westward/TSW's Plymouth studios in the Derry's Cross part of the city. There were four different Gus Honeybun puppets and TSW employed a person to create Gus Honeybun's wardrobe. Gus had a theme tune composed by TV composer Ed Welch. A short video was made to accompany it, featuring Gus and several TSW presenters walking around in Plymouth. A 7\\" picture disc single of the theme song was released in 1987 to several local record shops. Other Gus merchandise available included cuddly toy puppets, keyrings and car stickers. One car sticker said \\"Watch Gus on TSW!\\" and had his face and the TSW logo on it. The character was devised to fill unsold advertising slots during children's TV broadcasts. Several ITV franchise stations had at one time had a regional birthdays slot (often following Children's ITV or the predecessor children's television slot) with a continuity announcer and puppet announcing children's birthdays. With Gus, the announcer would read out a birthday card and the puppet would give a jump, known as a bunny hop, for each year of the child's life. Alternatives to bunny hops were ear waggles, head stands, winks and later \\"putting out the lights\\" and a colour-distorting \\"magic button\\". Gus appeared with virtually every Westward/TSW presenter, including the late Ian Stirling, Fern Britton, Judi Spiers, David Fitzgerald, Ruth Langsford & Sally Meen. The character was given the full name Augustus Jeremiah Honeybun by some continuity announcers, and was said to have been found under a gorse bush on Dartmoor in 1961 by the founders of Westward Television. During the TSW era, Gus was broadcast twice a day on weekdays (before and after Children's ITV), and usually once a day at weekends. The show usually lasted about 2 or 3 minutes per episode. From 1987 to 1990, TSW used to often opt out of showing the first and last Children's ITV in-vision continuity links of the day so it could fit in Gus' birthday slot on weekday afternoons. There was also a TSW-/Gus-branded Hoppa bus, made by local bus and coach company Western National. It was in regular use on most service routes until TSW's demise in 1992. Westcountry Cult Gus Honeybun attracted a cult following and it was not unknown for adults to write in requesting \\"bunny hops\\" etc. 12 was the official age limit for having a birthday read out on air, so people of 40 were presented as being 4 and so on. Gus Honeybun was so identified with regional television in the south-west that when TSW's managing director Harry Turner presented the station's ITV franchise renewal in 1991 he took Gus with him. However, Gus's Magic Birthdays series and his career at the station were ended at the start of 1993, when Westcountry Television took over from TSW after winning the franchise. The last ever Gus Honeybun programme, aired on 31 December 1992, at the tail end of the final TSW Today, which paid tribute to the station's 11 years of service, saw Gus returned to the moor and reunited with his rabbit family with the help of continuity announcers Ruth Langsford and David Fitzgerald. The successor ITV franchise Westcountry did provide a programme called Birthday People, but this was cancelled in 2004. In popular culture The puppet was spoofed on Victoria Wood As Seen On TV by Susie Blake's continuity announcer character accompanied by 'Wally Wallaby'. Terry Wogan for some time referred to Gloria Hunniford (whose show preceded his on national BBC Radio 2) as Gloria Honeybun. In the post-apocalyptic novel by Jasper Fforde entitled Shades of Grey, which is set 1500 years into the future, Devon and Cornwall are known as 'The Honeybun Peninsula'.

On December 28, 2010, the U.S. Department of State Bureau of Consular Affairs included the Boni National Reserve on the list of Kenyan areas American travelers should avoid because of terrorism and violent crime.Bureau of Consular Affairs, U.S. Department of State ‚Äì Kenya 28. Dec. 2010  Vegetation  The Boni forest, after which the reserve is named, is an indigenous open canopy forest and part of the Northern Zanzibar-Inhambane coastal forest mosaic. . Harbouring densities of plant species that are among the highest in the world, the forest has been declared a biodiversity hotspot.  Wildlife  Common herbivores in the region include hippopotamus, bushpig, warthog, buffalo, common duiker, topi and waterbuck. Common carnivores in the reserve are the vulnerable African wild dog and the aardwolf. Although extremely rare, African elephants are also present in the reserve.  Birds  As part of the East African coastal forest, it is likely to hold bird species characteristic of the coastal forests of eastern Africa, possibly including globally threatened species such as Sokoke pipit.  Al Shabaab Hide-out  The government of Kenya believes that Boni National Reserve has become a hide-out for the Al Shabaab, a terrorist organization based in Somalia This has led to several armed incursions into the reserve by the Kenya Defence Force and Kenya Police. In early 2017, US troops were reportedly giving Kenya assistance in attempts to remove Al Shabaab from the reserve .  Further reading  * Githiru, M. et al.

Iracema de Sousa Ferreira, Rio de Janeiro, March 23, 1922 - Rio de Janeiro, October 2003) was a Brazilian singer. She is also the most notable interpreter of the samba-can√ß√£o music style and a pioneer of the Brazilian rock. She first approached music by playing guitar by herself, and the father, in order to motivate, offered the instrument as a birthday gift. Along with Maysa Matarazzo, √Çngela Maria and Dolores Duran, was consecrated as the greatest samba-can√ß√£o interpreter (emerged in the thirties). Often compared to bolero, for the featured exaltation and exploration of romantic love or the suffering of a non accomplished love affair was also called \\"elbow ache\\" (jealousy, heart ache). Samba-can√ß√£o preceded the bossa nova (1957‚Äì1963) music style. But this one, inheritor of the American jazz, presented a more refined, gentle and soft melodies and interpretations, in detriment of those resented, melancholic ones. She began her career in 1950 and in 1953 she was already one of the greatest divas of the Brazilian Radio Era, interpreting Dorival Caymmi, Noel Rosa, Ary Barroso. In 1952 she recorded her first LP for the record label Continental Records, entitled Menino da rua. Despite being a notable samba- can√ß√£o interpreter, Nora Ney became one of the pioneers of the Brazilian rock by recording the first rock LP in the country: the Brazilian version of the Rock around the Clock, by Bill Haley & His Comets (soundtrack of Sementes da Viol√™ncia movie), in October 1955. After only one week after the launch the song became a hit parade. Among the curiosities of her public life stands out a second marriage with the singer Jorge Goulart; the daughter of that union, Vera L√∫cia, became Miss Brasil in 1963. Due to the political involvement of Goulart within the Communist Party, she was forced into exile after the 1964 Brazilian coup d'√©tat, which the military justified as being aimed at freeing the country against a communist threat.

He spent most of his career at Blackpool and Southampton. Playing career Neal was born in Fencehouses and started his playing career at Dinnington Main Colliery Welfare, from where, in 1925, he joined Blackpool, then in the Football League Second Division. He made his debut, in the number 7 shirt, on 1 May 1926, at Sheffield Wednesday in the final league game of the season. Over the next five seasons his appearance and goal totals in the league were: 17/3, 24/6, 32/5, 7/2 and 4/1. He helped Blackpool to the title in 1930, their only championship to date. He spent the first half of the 1931‚Äì32 season at Derby County, and in February 1932, the Southampton Supporters' Club put up the funds to secure his transfer to replace Bert Jepson. Over the next few seasons he was rarely out of the side and was a model of consistency despite the team's failure to achieve anything of merit, finishing regularly in mid-table in Division Two. In 1937, after 177 appearances for Southampton, he moved on to Bristol City before finishing his career at Accrington Stanley. Family His son Dick Neal Jr. was a professional footballer who played as a half-back for Lincoln City and Birmingham City in the 1950s and 1960s, whilst his brother, Arthur, played briefly for Liverpool and Darlington.

Biography The very earliest beginnings of Diabolic started in 1996, when drummer Aantar Coates (Exmortis, Horror of Horrors, Unholy Ghost, Blastmasters) teamed up with guitarist Kelly McLauchlin (Pessimist, Unholy Ghost, Possessed) to record the very first 4-song Diabolic Demo. Although this demo was never officially released, and sent only to select contacts in the underground, it marked the beginning of success to follow for the band. By January 1997, Diabolic drummer/founder Aantar Coates had relocated to Tampa, Florida and after forming the first complete lineup, recorded and released the successful demo \\"City of the Dead\\". This demo immediately got the band noticed in the worldwide underground press and was later released as MCD on Fadeless Records. By 1998, Diabolic made their debut live appearance opening for Vader in Tampa, Florida followed by Milwaukee Metalfest XII. The lineup was soon solidified to include Aantar Coates on drums, Paul Ouellette on lead guitar and vocals, Brian Malone on lead guitars, and Ed Webb on bass. In 1999, Diabolic recorded their debut full-length album Supreme Evil. This CD, which was mastered at Morrisound Recording Studios in Tampa and featured the artwork of Joe Petagno (Mot√∂rhead, Marduk, Krisiun), was released on Conquest/Hammerheart Records and received a multitude of excellent reviews and established an enormous international underground following for the band. More live shows soon followed, and the band continued gaining notoriety and writing for their next release. The following year in 2000, Diabolic recorded their second full-length album Subterraneal Magnitude, again released on Conquest/Hammerheart Records. Produced by Juan \\"Punchy\\" Gonzalez (Morbid Angel, Terrorizer), this over-the-top destructive force expanded the unique Diabolic sound to new extremes. By this time, vocalist Paul Ouellette had switched to bass, and the band had recruited Brian Hipp (Brutality, Cradle of Filth, Acheron) on lead guitars. Again featuring the art of Joe Petagno, it was clear that Diabolic was destined for success. Diabolic was soon enlisted for the \\"Death Metal Massacre Tour 2000\\", opening for Cannibal Corpse, God Dethroned and Hate Eternal, playing to sold-out venues for four weeks, all across the USA. In 2001, Diabolic was honored to be chosen for the prestigious Metal Maniacs \\"Xmass Ball Tour 2001\\", opening for Enslaved and Macabre (which included a one-off with Lacuna Coil!), followed by a 3-week North American Tour of the U.S. and Canada, supporting Marduk and Amon Amarth. Later that same year, Diabolic was hand-picked to open several dates across the southern U.S. with death metal pioneers Morbid Angel. In 2002, Diabolic signed to Century Media/Olympic Records and surpassed all earlier releases with their third CD, Vengeance Ascending. Once again produced by Juan \\"Punchy\\" Gonzalez, this devastating attack redefined extreme metal in a relentless onslaught of anger, vengeance, and victory. Again this CD featured the art of Joe Petagno, and new lead guitarist recruit Jerry Mortellaro. The band then departed on a month-long, sold-out U.S. Tour supporting Dimmu Borgir, Cryptopsy, and Krisiun, further solidifying the band as one of the underground's most ferocious upcoming death metal acts. In November 2002 Diabolic made their European debut, for a month-long tour of 10 countries in support of Behemoth, Destr√∂yer 666, and Deicide. By 2003, and after the European Tour, the band had gone through several major lineup changes. Gone was the original lineup, who had all been replaced. Led by sole remaining original member Brian Malone, the band recorded their fourth full-length CD, Infinity Through Purification. Produced by Neil Kernon (Cannibal Corpse, Nile, Judas Priest) and released on Century Media Records, this album had great potential, but without the trademark Diabolic of the past it garnered lackluster reviews. The band had even secured an opening slot on Deicide's upcoming U.S. Tour, but soon after the album's release, it was announced that the band was being dissolved permanently. It seemed that this would be the end of Diabolic. Meanwhile, Diabolic original members Aantar Cotes (drums), Paul Ouellette (vocals, bass) along with guitarists Kelly McLauchlin (Pessimist, Unholy Ghost, Possessed) and Jerry Mortellaro (also formerly of Diabolic) had joined together in 2003 to form a new band, Unholy Ghost. The band signed to Century Media/Olympic Recs, and released the debut CD Torrential Reign, produced by Juan \\"Punchy\\" Gonzalez (Morbid Angel, Terrorizer) as well as recorded a video for \\"Under Existence\\", released on Century Media Europe DVD. The band went on to play several hi-profile fests such as \\"Sun 'n' Steel\\" Florida Metalfest, Snakenet.com \\"Metal Nation\\" Fest, Las Vegas Metalfest, and \\"Gathering of the Bestial Legions\\" Metalfest in Los Angeles. Despite its apparent success, Unholy Ghost soon disbanded in 2005 and lead guitarist Kelly McLauchlin went back to work with Pessimist, and drummer Aantar Coates went on to form yet another new band, Blastmasters. By 2006, and amidst legal battles over the rights to use the name, Diabolic had re-formed. Original drummer Aantar Coates along with Unholy Ghost/Pessimist guitarist Kelly McLauchlin and parts of the Blastmasters lineup (RJ/guitars and Jesse Jolly/bass, Vox) recorded their comeback EP, Possessed By Death in 2007. Then after re- enlisting original bassist/vocalist Paul Ouellette in 2008, the band recorded yet another new EP, Chaos in Hell. Both self-produced EPs were recorded at DOW studios in Tampa, Florida again with long-time producer Juan \\"Punchy\\" Gonzalez. The band then signed to Deathgasm Records in 2008, and released both EPs on one CD, Chaos in Hell/Possessed by Death. Diabolic continued by playing select shows in Tampa with Monstrosity and Six Feet Under, and festivals including \\"Mayhem in May\\" in Louisville, Kentucky and \\"Gathering of the Bestial Legions III\\" Metalfest in Hollywood, California. The band returned once again to DOW Studios and longtime producer Juan \\"Punchy\\" Gonzalez (Morbid Angel, Terrorizer, Unholy Ghost) and in 2010, Diabolic has unleashed their newest slaying, Excisions of Exorcisms on Deathgasm Records with a return to a core lineup that featured original drummer Aantar Coates (Unholy Ghost, Exmortis, Horror of Horrors, Blastmasters), original bassist/vocalist Paul Ouellette (Unholy Ghost), and lead guitarists Kelly McLauchlin (Unholy Ghost, Pessimist, Possessed) and Jeff Parrish (Blastmasters). In April 2010, Diabolic was hand-selected to open the first several dates of the Cannibal Corpse \\"Evisceration Plague\\" Tour (in place of 1349), including shows in Atlanta GA, Raleigh NC, Washington DC and Long Island, NY. The band then made festival appearances at Las Vegas Deathfest II and Hostile City Death Fest II in Philadelphia, PA. Jeff Parrish died on February 14, 2013 from a heart attack in his sleep. He was 40 years old. Diabolic is currently writing new music for the next CD.

He spent almost a year on St Kilda and lived on several other remote islands. St Kilda St Kilda is an isolated outlying archipelago in the Outer Hebrides of Scotland, and Sands played an important role in bringing the plight of the islanders to the world's attention. On his second visit Sands became stranded there in the winter of 1876‚Äì7, and during that time invented the \\"mailboat\\" by attaching a message to a lifebuoy salvaged from the wreck of the Peti Dubrovacki and throwing it into the sea. His book Out of the World was published in 1878 after his two visits to the archipelago in 1875 and 1876-7.Steel (1988) page 180.\\"St Kilda\\" The National Trust for Scotland.

This unearthed the remains of gannet, sheep, cattle and limpets amidst various stone tools. The building is between 1,700 and 2,500 years old, which suggests that the St Kildan diet had changed little over the millennia. Indeed, the tools were recognised by the St Kildans, who could put names to them as similar devices were still in use.Maclean (1977) page 26. He publicly supported the St Kildans by, for example, writing to The Scotsman newspaper criticising MacLeod of Dunvegan, the island's landlord, for exploiting the residents.Maclean (1977) page 127. He also discovered that the Kelsall Fund, a bequest set up in 1860 to support the island's infrastructure, was unknown to the islanders more than fifteen years later and argued that those who paid taxes on tobacco and whisky were entitled to public services such as postal deliveries.Fleming (2005) pages 32, 152 and 154. It is possible his visits to St Kilda were in part prompted by his romantic interest in a young woman who lived there.Fleming (2005) page 153. Sands spoke a little Gaelic and his only reading material whilst there was a Gaelic bible. He spent nearly a year on St Kilda all told, but his outspoken views created enemies. For example, George Seton published St Kilda in 1878 and: > using ridicule, traditional right-wing rhetoric and sarcasm, he sought to > discredit Sands, calling him 'the theoretical philanthropist' and mocking > his claims to divine inspiration.Fleming (2005) pages153-4, quoting Seton, > George (1878) St Kilda Edinburgh, pages 316-7, from a 1980 facsimile of the > original. Nonetheless, Sands's efforts were influential in creating a regular steamer service to Hirta, the only permanently settled island of the St Kilda group.Fleming (2005) page 158. Other islands 1890s Ordnance Survey map of Papa Stour Sands also spent time on the remote Scottish islands of Vaila, Papa Stour and Foula in Shetland, and also lived on Tiree in the Inner Hebrides and the Faroe Islands.Fleming (2005) page 159. Whilst on Foula he fought hard against the prevailing truck system and created political cartoons lampooning its deficiencies. In one, he drew Foula as a beautiful young woman being strangled by a boa-constrictor labelled 'landlordism' watched by other reptiles called 'missionary', 'laird' and 'truck'.Fleming (2005) page 159. Fleming credits the source of this information as Nicolson, J. (3 July 1937) John Sands. Shetland Times.

He is occasionally described as a Member of Parliament.This mentioned briefly by Maclean (1977) page 117, and is repeated in the Rootsweb.com thread referred to above. No other evidence of him holding such office has emerged. This may be due to a misinterpretation of his appointment in 1876 by the people of St Kilda as their fear-ionaid or representative in their attempt to arrange for a steamer to call twice yearly at the island. Seton mockingly described him as the \\"M.P. for St Kilda\\".Seton, George (1878) St Kilda. Edinburgh. Page 27. See Google books search Retrieved 8 October 2007.

There is a church hall which is available for hire by community groups or for private functions. History The old St Mark's church was founded in 1841, with girls' and boys' schools adjacent to the building. The building was almost entirely rebuilt in 1871, and the chancel was extended in 1888. Following the redevelopment of Horsham town centre the church was mostly demolished, although the church spire was saved and can be seen in the town centre. The new St Mark's church was established in its current location 26 years ago, as a result of the vision of the Diocese and Parish to move the Church to an area of planned housing development. St Mark's Church is a friendly, vibrant, growing, and active church in the heart of North Horsham and in the Parish of Horsham. The building is modern in style, equipped with good facilities and it stands at the heart of the community which has formed over the last 30 years in the Holbrook area of North Horsham. St Mark's Church became a parish church in its own right on 18 October 2016, having become independent of the Parish of Horsham team ministry and will be known as St Mark's Holbrook.

Old Court Gatehouse of Queens' College, Cambridge From 1889, Frank Rutter was educated at Merchant Taylors' School, at that time in Aldersgate, where he specialised in Hebrew (under the influence of his father whose hobby was Biblical archaeology) and where pupils were expected to gain Oxbridge scholarships or exhibitions in classics: Rutter, aged seventeen tried but failed to gain a scholarship in history at Exeter College, Oxford, but was successful in the Queens' College, Cambridge, examination for a scholarship in Hebrew, going to university in 1896 and gaining the Semitic Language Tripos (degree) in 1899. Whilst still at school, Rutter, along with a fellow sixth form student, Edgar D., explored London nightlife, visiting music halls, eating out in Gatti's Restaurant and joining nightclubs, which were then an adjunct to the more formal London's gentleman's club, providing a dining room, ballroom, writing room, and female membership, which was not taken up by respectable women in society, although the male membership was mostly respectable; Rutter's father happily financed these activities. When at Cambridge, Rutter gained popularity through his banjo- playing, and, thanks to the good train service available, extended his social pursuits to Paris, first visiting in 1898, speaking French fluently and often staying for a month at a time in the city, where he made friends in the Latin Quarter. After university, spent a few months as an itinerant tutor, then began as a freelance writer in London with a newly acquired typewriter. One of his successful interviews was with Bernard Shaw on the subject of housing problems‚Äîthe text of which was entirely provided by Shaw himself; The Times printed an interview with the American scout, Major Burnham, on his return from South Africa. He obtained posts as assistant editor of To-day and the Sunday Special, both part of the same publishing group. In February 1901, he became sub-editor of the Daily Mail, and began to write art criticism, mostly for The Financial Times and The Sunday Times. In 1902, he went back to To-day as editor for two years, and for a short time brought it back into profit, until it succumbed to cheaper competition and was merged with London Opinion. In 1903, Leonard Rees appointed him art critic of The Sunday Times, a post he held for the rest of his life, 34 years in all. Rutter honed his skills whilst doing the job, and also made the acquaintance of leading artists in Paris through frequenting the caf√©s. The French Impressionist Fund Claude Monet. Lavacourt Under Snow, 1878‚Äì1881. Rutter's unsuccessful, too \\"advanced\\", choice for the National Gallery. In 1903 the creation of the National Art Collections Fund initiated many years of frustration for Rutter, who believed it would siphon off available money from his own aims.Lago, Mary. Christiana Herringham and the Edwardian Art Scene, University of Missouri Press, 1996. , He was a strong supporter of Impressionist and Expressionist Modernism.Taylor, Brandon.

He considered \\"perfectly dreadful\\"Rutter, Frank.

Raging with indignation, he wrote articles on this omission, gave lectures, and, galvanised by the opening of the Impressionist exhibition staged by Durand- Ruel at the Grafton Galleries in London in 1905, he persuaded the editor and proprietors of The Sunday Times to allow space for a public subscription, the French Impressionist Fund. Sargent and Wertheimer each sent ten guineas; Blanche Marchesi staged a fund-raising concert; Rutter, although \\"extremely nervous\\" gave his first lecture at the Grafton Galleries. Sir Claude Phillips and D.S. MacColl joined him on the executive committee of the fund, and contributions slowly mounted up to ¬£160, sufficient at that time to buy a top class Impressionist painting. Rutter's choice was Monet's V√©theuil: Sunshine and Snow (since retitled Lavacourt under Snow), which MacColl was in favour of and Durand-Ruel had promised to sell for the amount collected, but Phillips pointed out that National Gallery did not accept work by living artists; discreet enquiries revealed that the gallery trustees also found too \\"advanced\\" Manet, Sisley and Pissarro: \\"They were certainly dead‚Äîbut they had not been dead long enough for England\\", wrote Rutter, adding \\"I nearly wept with disappointment.\\" Eug√®ne Boudin.

MacColl ascertained that the trustees would accept Eug√®ne Boudin, who Rutter protested was not an Impressionist but whom he accepted out of necessity, mollified by MacColl's argument that \\"he's the beginning of Impressionism and we can make a start with him.\\" To avoid any accusations of logrolling Durand-Ruel's exhibition, they agreed that Rutter would travel to Van der Veldt, a private collector in Le Havre, to choose a Boudin painting. He brought back as personal luggage Boudin's 1888 painting, Entre les jet√©es, Trouville (The Entrance to Trouville Harbour),Variously titled also as Port of Trouville and Harbour at Trouville. and wrote to MacColl on 11 October 1905 to inform him of the work he had selected, which Van der Veldt had accepted ¬£120 for provided it would go to a national collection and which was waiting at the Goupil Gallery for MacColl to see.\\"Manuscripts Catalogue ‚Äì Document Details\\", University of Glasgow.

Rutter was a natural organiser and, with the help of Lucien Pissarro attracted 80 members.Glew states 40 members. Rutter was keen to mount a foreign section in the first show, and liaised over this with Jan de Holewinski (1871‚Äì1927), who was in London to arrange a Russian art and craft show. The first AAA show in July 1908 was in the Royal Albert Hall and had over 3,000 works on display. Wassily Kandinsky c. 1913. In 1909, at the second show in the Royal Albert Hall, over 1,000 works were shown, mainly by British artists, but also the first works (two paintings and twelve woodcuts) exhibited in London by Wassily Kandinsky.Glew, Adrian. \\"Every work of art is the child of its time\\" , Tate Etc., issue 7, Summer 2006.

Rutter was secretary of the AAA and organised it for four years. It was artistically accomplished, but not so financially. Through the AAA, Rutter helped many artists, such as Charles Ginner, who, although not achieving outstanding success, was able to gain an audience and develop a loyal following for his work.The Times, 7 January 1952, p. 6, Issue 52202, col E, \\"Mr. Charles Ginner\\".

From October 1909 to 1912, Rutter also published and edited the weekly, cheaply printed Art News (sold for 2d a week), the journal of the AAA, like which it had an open-door policy on contributors, featuring the lectures given to the Royal Academy Schools by Sir William Blake Richmond, as well as Sickert's attack on the Royal Academy, \\"Straws from Cumberland Market\\", his column on topical issues being the main attraction.Yeates, p. 140 It was promoted as the \\"First Art Newspaper in the United Kingdom\\".

On 30 August 1909 Rutter married Thirz Sarah (Trixie, born 1887/8), whose father, James Henry Tiernan, was a member of the New Zealand Police. With the encouragement of George Bernard Shaw, Rutter became a member of the Fabian Society. On 12 January 1910, at the Eustace Miles Restaurant, Rutter chaired the meeting of a group which developed into the Men's Political Union for Women's Enfranchisement,Crawford, Elizabeth. The Women's Suffrage Movement: A Reference Guide, 1866‚Äì1928, p. 612, Routledge, 2001. , of which he was the honorary treasurer.Bryson, Norman; Holly, Ann Michael; Moxey, Keith P. F.

Four months later he was the speaker representing the Press at the John Stuart Mill Celebrations, which were staged by the Women's Freedom League. In 1910, Roger Fry occupied the limelight of avant-garde campaigning for art, when he outraged the public with an exhibition Manet and the post- impressionists at the Grafton Galleries, showcasing work by Van Gogh, Gauguin and C√©zanne. Rutter had put the term Post-Impressionist in print in Art News of 15 October 1910, three weeks before Fry's show, during a review of the Salon d'Automne, where he described Othon Friesz as a \\"post-impressionist leader\\"; there was also an advert in the journal for the show The Post- Impressionists of France.Bullen, J. B. Post-impressionists in England, p.37. Routledge, 1988. , Rutter quickly supported Fry's venture with a small book Revolution in Art (enlarged in 1926 as Evolution in Modern Art), its title derived from Gauguin's statement that \\"in art there are only revolutionists or plagiarists.\\" Rutter wrote in the dedication: \\"To Rebels of either sex all the world over who in any way are fighting for freedom of any kind I dedicate this study of their painter-comrades.\\" On 25 March 1911, Rutter chaired a meeting of the Men's Political Union at Caxton Hall, Westminster, and reported that a recent court case at Leeds, in which Alfred Hawkings had been awarded ¬£100 damages for being ejected from a meeting, was \\"a distinct victory for the suffragist cause.\\" Rutter roused cheers from his listeners upon exhorting them that they needed to prove to their opponents that \\"the reign of bullying, tyranny, and savagery must come to an end.\\"The Times, 27 March 1911, p. 6, issue 39543, col F, \\"Woman Suffrage.

Rutter's Art News reported on the AAA show of July 1911 and also printed the Futurist Painters Manifesto (first printed as the Technical Manifesto of Futurist Painting in February 1909 in Le Figaro).Yeates, p.122 In April 1912, because of financial difficulties, Rutter resigned as secretary of the AAA, which had been strongly supported by Lucien Pissarro, Walter Sickert and others, but which he felt was nevertheless dwindling away due to what he condemned as \\"the incurable snobbishness of the English artist\\". That year he relocated from London to Leeds for the next five years, having been appointed curator of the Leeds City Art Gallery at a salary of ¬£300 per annum. He continued to advocate new ventures in art through his column \\"Round the galleries\\" in The Sunday Times. Opening of Leeds City Art Gallery in 1888 from The Illustrated London News. He used his house at 7 Westfield Terrace, Chapel Allerton, Leeds, to provide accommodation for suffragettes released from prison under the Cat and Mouse Act and recovering from hunger strike. In 1913, he provided a character reference so that a job could be obtained in Europe by a \\"mouse\\", Elsie Duval; another, Lilian Lenton, a suffragette arsonist also escaped via his home to France in June that year with the aid of his wife. Elizabeth Crawford, author of The Women's Suffrage Movement, suggests that other similar events must have taken place, but were kept quiet at the time out of necessity and, later, due to Rutter's taciturnity. He wrote in an epilogue to his autobiography: :the only furiously active part of my life was the few years during which I was connected with the militant suffrage movement and of this I have said nothing, because if I once began I should want to fill a volume with my experiences during this exciting time. It is all over now, the battle has been won, and this is not the place in which to recount the skirmishes in which I had the honour to take part.\\" He did not agree with the later, more extreme tactics of the WSPU leaders, who nevertheless still commanded his respect and admiration. He encouraged the artist, Emily Susan Ford (1850‚Äì1930), Vice-Chairman of the Artists' Suffrage League and exhibited her work in the Leeds gallery.Crawford, pp. 225‚Äì226. Rutter initially had plans to create a modern art collection at the Leeds gallery, but had been frustrated in this aim by \\"boorish\\" local councillors; his association with the escape of Lilian Lenton had further damaged his standing. Before he left the city, he co-founded the Leeds Art Collections Fund with Michael Sadler, who was the vice-chancellor of Leeds University and a collector of work by Kandinsky and Gauguin. The Fund helped with acquisitions and shows, among them the first major John Constable show and another in June 1913 of Post-Impressionism held at the Leeds Arts Club, which had been started by Holbrook Jackson and A. R. Orage, editor of The New Age, and was galvanised by the new activity. The discussions there about contemporary art had a significant influence on the thinking of Herbert Read (1893‚Äì1968), who was introduced to modern art by Rutter. Rutter's plan for a literary version of the AAA had a strong appeal for Read. Futurism Robert Bevan. The Cabyard, Night. In October 1913, Rutter was commissioned by the Dor√© Gallery at 35 Bond Street in the West End to curate the Post- Impressionist and Futurist Exhibition, which displayed the story of those movements from Camille Pissarro to Vorticist Wyndham Lewis (who was no longer on good terms with Fry). Rutter's choice of Pissarro as a starting point was in contradistinction to the stance of Fry and the Bloomsbury Group, who saw C√©zanne as the beginning of modern art.Yeates, p.125 Rutter made a link between the British artists he supported and the French intimiste painters, as well as featuring artworks by Severini and Boccioni of the Italian Futurism movement‚Äîwhich had been shown in London first by the Sackville Gallery‚Äîand by Br√¢ncu»ôi, Epstein, Delaunay and Signac. Rutter's consummate curation and catalogue foreword were a testament to his deep knowledge of the subject. He praised Nevinson's The Departure of the Train De Luxe as \\"the first English Futurist picture\\".Walsh, Michael.

He was a supportive friend and good company who injected conversations with humour, for which he adopted an \\"uncular\\" manner. He was modest and generous, not motivated by personal ambition, but advancing the interests of art and artists over any profit for himself. His approach was not that of an intellectual applying logic impersonally, but through aesthetic intuition and an empathy for the creative process. His knowledge of art history sufficed for his needs, and he could be critical, but his main feature was the display of personal judgement and a preference to address the work he could enjoy.

She won the Gold Medal at the 1970 First New York International Art Show, the Grand Prix at the 1971 Locust Valley Art Show on Long Island, New York, and the Award of Excellence at the Abraham & Straus-Hempstead Art Show, \\"Long Island Art '74\\" for her explorations of Classical Realism. Matsuki was first woman member of the Salmagundi Club. Biography Matsuki was born March 16, 1936 in Ury≈´, Hokkaid≈ç, Japan, to educators Satoru and Masue Matsuki. Her father Satoru's opposition to the Japanese War led to official reprisals forcing him and his family into hiding for most of World War 2. After the surrender of Japan, his known anti-war sentiments resulted in his being given an education leadership post, where he applied the innovations of American educator Ruth Benedict and philosopher John Dewey to the Japanese educational system, earning him an award from Emperor Hirohito in 1970. The family lived in a number of locations on Hokkaid≈ç, finally the resort city Noboribetsu, famed for its scenery and hot springs. Matsuki's lineal ancestors had moved to southern Hokkaid≈ç in the late 19th century. Matsuki was awarded a scholarship to the Women's College of Fine Art's Faculty of Western Painting (now known as Joshibi University of Art and Design), Tokyo. She graduated in 1958 with a Bachelor of Arts degree. Her graduation work ‚ÄúDaphne‚Äù (oil, approximately 4' by 5'), is in the collection of the Noboribetsu Cultural Center, Hokkaid≈ç, Japan. The painting suffered some notoriety for its sensuality; briefly pulled from view, it mysteriously reappeared on the display wall the next morning. Her two teaching jobs, one at an elementary school in Itabashi Precinct in 1959, the other at Shimura Daisan Junior High School in Tokyo in 1960, illuminated for her the malleability of children per the call of art critic and historian Herbert Read for originality and creativity. She was an active member of the Tokyo Teachers Union. In 1960 the Teachers Union Monthly published a presentation and lecture Matsuki gave in the Bunkyo Precinct in Tokyo, where, speaking on behalf of the teachers of the more working class Itabashi precinct, she called for adoption throughout the Japanese educational system of the education principles laid out by Read in his book Education Through Art. In 1961 Matsuki married American airman Herman Berry at the American Embassy in Tokyo. They left Japan in 1962 and for the next seven years lived at airbases in Europe and the United States. When her husband was sent to Pakistan, Matsuki spent eighteen months with Berry's relatives, where she painted portraits of residents of their remote Appalachian mountain community in western North Carolina. Upon his return, they spent four years at the Spangdahlem Air Base in Germany. During this period (1964 to 1968), Matsuki visited Rome and painted commissioned portraits for five Air Force officers and their wives, and was commissioned by the Officers Club of the 49th Tactical Squadron to paint a portrait of the recently deceased USAF fighter ace Richard Bong. Matsuki became increasingly disillusioned with her marriage. In 1969 she divorced Berry while they were living at Calumet Air Force Station in northern Michigan. Uterine cancer shortly caused her to get a hysterectomy at age 32. She spent that summer in Albany, Oregon, where she submitted the winning design for the logo of the 1969 Albany Jaycees Timber Carnival. This being the carnival's 25th anniversary, the theme was \\"passing the torch.\\" Matsuki's drawing, shown here on the carnival's pinback button, depicts a young logger with hardhat and chainsaw and an elderly logger with wool cap and axe, standing behind a short bark-covered log. The young logger has an arm around the shoulder of his elder in a comradely fashion. Informed that six years would pass before she could be declared free of cancer, in 1970 she plunged into the New York fine arts cultural scene. By 1975 her explorations of Classical Realism had won her a gold medal at the 1970 First New York International Art Show, membership as one of the first woman artists in the hitherto men-only New York art club, the Salmagundi Club, the Grand Prix at the 1971 Locust Valley Art Show on Long Island, New York, and the Award of Excellence at the 1974 Abraham & Straus- Hempstead Art Show, \\"Long Island Art '74\\". Becoming less concerned about a resurgence of cancer, Matsuki, who'd become known as \\"the shark\\" by friends for her seemingly never slowing down, then worked at a more leisurely pace and stopped entering competitions. She returned to Oregon in 1980, where she taught at the Albany Art Center, worked on a baccalaureate at Oregon State University in nearby Corvallis, employed by the university as a janitor, and created additional drawn works. During a brief sojourn in California, Matsuki painted a mural at a health spa in Isla Vista. In 1985, Matsuki met Earth First! activist Ron Huber in Corvallis, Oregon. Several months later, she drew the cover art for the August 1985 edition of the Earth First! Journal. The drawing featured Huber treesitting in an old growth Douglas fir, confronted by two Linn County sheriff's deputies elevated to him by a crane. Samizu Matsuki's Maryland farmhouse, by artist Charles Trauth Matsuki married Huber in 1987. They moved to Cheverly, Maryland in 1988, then to Rockland, Maine in 1992. Neurological problems that flared up in 1991 while living in a farmhouse in Calvert County, Maryland led to a reduction in Matsuki's painting and drawing efforts for more than a decade. In 2006 Matsuki underwent a physical and neurological rehabilitation regimen. In 2010 she was diagnosed with chronic Lyme disease, stemming from as far back as 1991. On August 4, 2018, Matsuki died of cancer at her Rockland home. Two of her works,Ah... and A Celebrator are owned by collector Cristina Chan Johnston of Huntingtown, Maryland.

Matsuki's winning entries at two major New York art shows in 1970 helped rekindle enthusiasm for realistic painting among American artists. In 1970, Matsuki's painting \\"Triumphal Return\\" earned her two awards: the Gold Medal at the First New York International Art Show *, (her first entry in open competition), and the Grand Prix at the Locust Valley Art Show *, on Long Island, New York. According to Matsuki her works \\"integrate the classic Western method of painting with the theoretical propriety of Contemporary Art, including the colour theory of pointillism, multiple focal points of the Cubists, Modiglianni's deformations; Buffe's ‚ÄúIdeosyncracyism\\" Picasso‚Äôs dislocation of perspective, and the dislocation of time and or space of Egyptian wall painting. Matsuki's \\"Magical Realism\\" as she dubbed her painting style, pays close attention to fine detail, with subtly impossible perspectives, triggering an emotional charge to the works' subject matters. \\"Triumphal Return\\" (1970, oil on canvas, 50\\" by 60\\") reveals the thousand-yard stare of air force veteran Andrew Delaney, musing among his childhood relics in the Long Island enclave Rockville Center.Large image of Triumphal Return Matsuki describes the purposes and techniques involved in the painting of Triumphal Return: > The painting ‚ÄúTriumphal Return‚Äù was done in the epoch where the Vietnam War > was nearing its zenith. The most vocal of all sentiments was that of 'anti- > war'. The most immediate experience which inspired my theme was the one > where I, by chance, attended the yearly ceremony of the local American > Legion, Long Island New York, in which the entire procession was conducted > seemingly most diffident and eventlessly hastened up way. The National > Anthem was sung in hushed voices in disarray. The white rectangular military > caps looked as forlorn as the brown of deserted piers. There was something > moved me deep enough to plunge into my first major work, which the > production of demanded total concentration for four months working every > night (I painted during night.) Except for Saturday. I went to the movies > during the day, to the bar at night for distraction. Preparation of painting > surface was done by mixture of opaque and transparent regular oil color > pigments produced by Windsor and Newton and Grumbacher which eventually took > the hue of reddish dark brown. I used a commercially prepared cotton small > grain canvas. So far acceptable for my rendition of details. On this > prepared surface, of approximately 1~2 mm thickness of the pigment after > sufficient dryness was achieved, I first transferred the final sketch of the > theme using medium strength charcoal of commercial origin. Approximately 3 > or 4 coats of a commercial brand fixative were applied before the execution > of final underdrawing (cartoon) by oil colour, mixture of burnt umber and > Prussian blue in various composition ratio for the purpose of shortening > drying period, with pure turpentine, as medium. When the under-drawing was > sufficiently dry, therefore accepting overlapping pigment application > without causing surface damage, I began first application of painting, > molding. Medium: pure turpentine plus linseed oil. Ratio, approximately 2 > turp/1 linseed. Pigments used were burnt umber, optional Prussian blue and > yellow ochre (in later paintings I changed this colour to Naples yellow, > because of its larger covering strength and fast drying speed.) After > adequate surface dryness of the so far monochromatic sketched first coat (at > this level the entire pictorial plane was equally developed), the second > coat was applied to achieve chromatic ‚Äúmapping‚Äù according to the > psychological connotation and aesthetic atmosphere desired by the theme. In > this case, I began by using opaque-est possible pigments for the purpose of > similar strength such as yellow ochre, cobalt blue, burnt sienna etc, and > quick drying properties like umbers, prussian blue, naples yellow mixed by > turp and linseed with aforementioned concoction ratio. At this stage the > entire effect of the painting still presents monochromatic, relief-like > quality, although proper hues were ascribed to the major areas of the > composition. I call it ‚Äúthe view at dusk‚Äù for its similarity in chromatic > effects. At this stage the painting surface began to appear ‚Äúrealistic.‚Äù > Since the canvas dimensions of ‚ÄúTriumphal Return‚Äù is rather large, 50\\" by > 60\\", the earlier applications became dry enough to accept further > application by the time this coast was finished. Once this stage is > achieved, real part of ‚Äúpainting‚Äù begins: rendering of the objects with > utmost objective fidelity. The method I used for this purpose was glazing > (thin application of transparent pigment) techniques employing pigments of > high transparency such as alizarin crimson, ultramarine, prussian blue, > verdian green, chrome yellow, aureolin, zinc white, ivory black, etc. I > found later on that the family of ‚ÄúThalo‚Äù had good property for glazing. > Especially thalo violet was intriguing in its chameleon-like adaptation to > the underlying hues. With same pigment, thalo violet, one can develop > several nuances upon surfaces depending on the hues of previous > application(s). Thalo family was considered by authority such as Ralph Meyer > as comparatively safe but not time tested to the perfect desirability, which > might take 500 years to complete. If the surface of ‚ÄúTriumphal Return‚Äù > crumbles, then the Thalo family of pigments should be buried with it. When > the entire pictorial surface was covered and safely dried, I used larger > brushes such as 1inch or 1 inch flat, sable and fanshaped and or pig hair > brushes, employing ‚Äúwash‚Äù technique which is similar to second coating, to > go over the entire canvas in order to achieve thematic and pictorial unity*. > This is the final stage of the painting. When the surface becomes adequately > dry, regular application of 3~4 coat of ‚Äúretouch‚Äù varnish (I use this > frequently to bring out sunk-in colors) was given to the entire pictorial > surface.

In 1971, New York's towers have crumbled in her eerie work __opia, which truncated phrase is printed on a scrap of paper blowing past two women in the shattered landscape of the ruined city. The work took shape in her shocked reaction to discovering America's greatest city in decay, even fabled Harlem. Oil on canvas. Large size image of ___opia Audio recording: Samizu Matsuki describing this work(recorded April 18, 1989) Also in 1971 Matsuki painted Barbara and the Fortune Teller in which a young woman who had fled bourgeois suburbia for Greenwich Village, now flees what she'd just learned from a swart gypsy in a hovel beneath a howling subway crossing. Oil on canvas. Large size image of Barbara and the Fortuneteller In 1973, after a year in Japan, Matsuki returned to New York City. A newspaper photograph of a wrecked Egyptian tank‚Äîin the aftermath of the Yom Kippur War‚Äîbecame, in her 1974 oil painting Ah... a shattered, larger-than-life partly devoured lobster sprawling across bleak, ruffled newsprint. Oil on canvas. Ah... won the Award of Excellence at the Abraham & Straus-Hempstead Art Show, \\"Long Island Art '74\\". According to Matsuki, her oil painting A Celebrator (Oil & canvas, 60\\"x 50\\") reflects the growing culture of detachment and narcissism that she saw enveloping America. Located, like Triumphal Return, in a basement, the painting-within-a-painting format, and the attention to detail of the figurines, the crystal, the scattered clothing, the carpet and hookah, the doubled image of an artillery shell recovered from the USS Maine, and the carefully impossible perspective make A Celebrator\\" one of her finest works. Large size image of A Celebrator In the 1976 painting \\"Blue Ghost\\" Matsuki manifests a line in a Russian poem by Esunin. In that poem he said ‚ÄúBlue Ghost! Neither here nor there.‚Äù Matsuki describes her work Blue Ghost thus: \\"The painting depict some aspects of upper class bourgeois life which was then my environment. The mirror behind the central figure reflects finer things of the past. The left side of the painting represents the past, the center is the present, while the right side and the bottom, the future. The giant compass divides things of the past from those of the future. Through the arch one sees the debris of civilization.\\" \\"I painted Blue Ghost first in only two colors: titanium white and Payne‚Äôs gray. (I applied color afterward by method of glazing.) I found advantage in monochrome painting , freeing me from having to consider problems of matching shades of color. This gave me a perfect stage for freely developing image directly on the canvas.\\" References External links * Samizu Matsuki's website Category:1936 births Category:2018 deaths Category:20th-century Japanese women artists Category:Contemporary painters Category:Japanese painters Category:People from Hokkaido Category:Members of the Salmagundi Club Category:Oregon State University alumni Category:People from Rockland, Maine Category:Postmodern artists ","title":"Samizu Matsuki"},{"id":"13615793","text":"The Council of State (), is the supreme consultative council of the Spanish Government. The current Council of State was established in 1980 according to the article 107 of the Constitution of 1978. The institution of the Council of State, understood as supreme consultative council of the Government, has existed intermittently since 1812. During the Ancien R√©gime, the Council of State advised the King about foreign policy. History The council as the body through which the monarchs ruled their territories has its origins in the Crown of Castile with the creation of the Council of Castile in 1385 by King John II. Other peninsular kingdoms like Navarre also created its own council in 1481 by Queen Joan II and in Arag√≥n in 1494 by King Ferdinand the Catholic. =Foreign affairs council (1522‚Äì1834)= The King Charles I inherited vast territories through Europe and decided to create a new council called ¬´of State¬ª due to the enormous foreign policy that marked his reign. This council started its duties in 1526 when Sultan Suleiman the Magnificent threatened Spanish possessions in Austria. It was the only Council that did not have a president, because it was the King himself who assumed that function. His advisors were not specialists in laws but experts in international relations, such as the Duke of Alba or Nicol√°s Perrenot. The councilors were, therefore, members of the high nobility and the high clergy. In times of Philip II sometimes the monarch did not preside over the councils and, in his place, sent to its secretary Antonio Perez. It had a great influence during the reigns of Charles I and Philip II and later during the regency of Mariana of Austria (1665‚Äì1675). The reforms of Philip V (1700‚Äì1746) emptied its actual power, although Manuel de Godoy wished to revive it in 1792. Unlike the Council of Castile, in which the King listened to the councilors and executed the conclusions presented to him, in the Council of State was the King himself who exposed the points to be discussed, listened to his advisors and, subsequently, the same monarch made the decisions that were to be made. =Supreme consultative council of the Government (1812‚Äìtoday)= The Council of State has existed intermittently during 19th and 20th centuries. The Constitution of 1812 granted the King the executive power and established that this was the only council to which the King could go to ask for advice. This obligation was over in 1814 when King Ferdinand VII restored absolutism. The Constitution configured the Council as a King-control-body forcing the King to take to the council important issues like the sanction of the laws, the declaration of war or the conclusion of treaties that in any case the sovereign could undertake without having previously \\"heard\\" the Council. With the death of the King in 1833, the year later the council was abolished and the Royal Council of Spain and the Indies was created instead as a superior consultative body but was abolished in 1836. In 1845, under the name of Royal Council the body was restored and for the first time the Presidency of the Council was granted to the Prime Minister. In 1858 the original name recovered and since then the council has been regulated by numerous laws, the latest in 1980. Nowadays the Council of State continues being the main and superior consultative body of the Government, but since 1991 some economic and social competencies have been transferred to the Economic and Social Council. Current organization The Council of State has its headquarters in the Palace of the Councils, Madrid. (LOCE ¬ß 1.3) The Council of State Organic Act establish that the Council will watch for the observance of the Constitution and the rest of the legal order when the Government ask for its advice or when the laws establish it (LOCE ¬ß 2.1). The Council is formed by its President that is appointed by the Council of Ministers with the advice of the Prime Minister after appearing before Congress and three kind of Councilors: * The Permanent Councilors. *: To be elected Permanent Councilor you must have previously been Minister, President or minister of a regional government, Councilor of State, member of the Advisory Councils of the regional governments, Chief Law Clerk of the Council of State, Academic of number of the Royal Academies integrated into the Institute of Spain, Full professor of law, economic or social disciplines in the University, with fifteen years of experience, General Officer of the Legal Bodies of the Armed Forces, State civil servants with fifteen years of service at least in bodies or scales for which admission is required university degree or former Governors of the Bank of Spain. * The Born Councilors. *: To be elected Born Councilor you must have previously been Prime Minister, director of the Royal Academies, President of the Economic and Social Council, Attorney General, Chief of the Defence Staff, President of the General Council of Lawyers, President of the Ministry of Justice' General Codification Committee, Solicitor General, Director of the Center for Political and Constitutional Studies or Governor of the Bank of Spain. * The Elective Councilors. *: To be elected Elective Councilor you must have previously been Member of Parliament, Magistrate of the Constitutional Court, Judge or Advocate General of the Court of Justice of the European Union, Ombudsman, President or Member of the General Council of the Judiciary, Minister or Secretary of State, President of the Court of Auditors, Chief of the Defense Staff, President or Minister of a Regional Government, Ambassador from the diplomatic career, Mayor of a provincial capital, President of the Provincial Council, of the Inter-Island Commonwealth, of the Island Council or of the Insular Council or University Rector.

It is part of the United Synagogue family of synagogues. Synagogue Wembley United Synagogue is a member of the United Synagogue, an organisation of London Jews that was founded with the sanction of an act of parliament, in 1870 and which is the largest religious grouping within the British Jewish community, covering 62 Orthodox Jewish communities, and takes its religious authority from the Chief Rabbi of the United Kingdom (UK). The demographics of the local Middlesex Jewish communities incorporating Wembley, Kenton and Kingsbury are such that these communities are in terminal decline. In 2017 Wembley Synagogue had an average Saturday morning attendance of 20 to 30 people with many existing members choosing to frequent other local more vibrant synagogues. It is said the United Synagogue is looking to redevelop the site and close the synagogue which once boasted a membership of 1500. History By 1928 there were already a few isolated Jewish families living in Wembley who felt they wanted to get together for the purpose of worship and in order to facilitate Hebrew and Religious Education. At that time the nearest organised communities were at Cricklewood, Harrow and Ealing. But the movement of Jewish populations from east, north and Central London had already begun and one of the directions it took was towards the Northwestern suburbs of London which had been made accessible by the rapid transport facilities afforded by the Metropolitan and other railways lines. The first meeting at which it was decided to form the Wembley Hebrew Congregation took place on 5 September 1928. Mr H Hooberman was appointed Chairman of the Congregation. The first classes were held in January 1929. A Ladies' Guild was formed in February 1930 and the Congregation became affiliated to the United Synagogue in 1931. At first the services were held only at Festival times and without any congregational premises various halls had to be used such as the Union Hall in Ealing Road, Mitchell's Restaurant in Wembley High Road and later the Capital Ballroom in Empire Way. At the end of 1931 membership had risen to 64 and already the feeling for finding a permanent home had prompted the Committee to purchase part of the site of the present synagogue buildings. 1934 saw the firm establishment of the Wembley Community. On 22 April, Sir Isidore Salmon laid the Foundation Stone of the first temporary synagogue. In June the decision was taken to appoint a Minister and a call was extended to the then Rev. Myer Berman. In the same year, the status of the synagogue was raised to that of a District Synagogue. On 2 September, the Induction of the Minister and the Consecration of the Synagogue was performed by the then Chief Rabbi of the UK, Joseph H. Hertz. In August 1939 the Ladies Guild purchased the first Sefer Torah for the synagogue. In November of that year the house next door to the open site, 12 Forty Avenue, was purchased. A Building Fund had been formed with Sir Isidore Salmon, who was the Member of Parliament for the Harrow West constituency, which then included Wembley, as President. Membership rapidly increased between then and the outbreak of World War II and further building operations of a temporary character had to be undertaken. Rev. Berman was commissioned in 1940 as a chaplain in the army until his return to Wembley on demobilisation in March 1946. The Rev. S. Venitt was appointed as temporary Minister during his absence. In 1949 it was realised that the site of the synagogue would be too small to accommodate the new synagogue whenever it was built. And when the opportunity arose, 10 Forty Avenue was purchased so that a total frontage of some 200 ft. was made available for future development. It was felt that one comprehensive scheme should be prepared and building operation commenced on that section which would house the Classes Wing. Accommodation for the children's education was thought to be a priority. On 23 March 1953 the foundation stone of the classroom wing was laid and on 25 October the classroom wing was consecrated by Chief Rabbi Israel Brodie. After numerous appeals and fund raising efforts, building operations on the new synagogue were commenced in 1956 and the foundation stone was laid on 17 November 1956.

Mineta San Jose International Airport\\" for his work in establishing a major airport in the city. Early life Ernie Renzel was born as a third-generation resident of San Jose. His grandfather, Conrad Renzel, was a San Jose baker who gradually expanded his South First Street bakery into a grocery store in the 1860s. Renzel's father, E.H. Renzel Sr., further expanded the family business to a wholesale grocery distributor by the 1880s. Renzel Sr. would become vice president and manager of the family grocery firm, Keystone Co., by the turn of the 20th century. Renzel was active in leadership activities while enrolled at San Jose High School. He served as student body president of the high school, joined the Rotary Club and held a perfect attendance record. Renzel was also an accomplished athlete during his early years and excelled at basketball, swimming and tennis. Renzel went on to study economics at Stanford University following his graduation from high school. He remained with the family grocery business after completing his degree at Stanford. Renzel held a wide range of interests throughout his life including economics, athletics and classical Greek philosophy. He was married to his wife, Emily Hillebrand for 63 years, until her death in 1999. Norman Y. Mineta San Jose International Airport Ernie Renzel became an important advocate for the establishment and development of a new airport to serve San Jose and the surrounding region. Renzel personally scouted land for his project. Renzel located a suitable site, which at the time was a ranch, for the future airport in the late 1930s. He negotiated a price with the ranch owner in order to purchase the land. Renzel then championed a citywide ballot measure in 1940, which passed, in order to pay for the land acquisition. Renzel remained actively involved in the airport, even after its expansion from a municipal airport into San Jose International Airport. He served as airport commissioner from 1969 until 1977. He oversaw much of the expansion of the airport during his tenure as commissioner. Renzel was honored for his work in establishing Norman Y. Mineta San Jose International Airport with a bust of his image, which was dedicated in Terminal C in 1994. In 2004, the airport's airfield, which includes all of the airport's taxiways and runways, were renamed in his honor. Political career Renzel was introduced to city politics during World War II. According to the San Jose Mercury News, Charlie Bigley, a San Josean taxi operator, was a major political boss in San Jose in the years before and during World War II. Bigley was consistently able to get a majority of his supporters elected to the San Jose City Council. However, Bigley's grip on power began to slip during the war. Two incumbent city council members left the city government in order to enlist in the U.S. military during World War II. Their departure left six of the seven city council seats open during the 1944 San Jose municipal election. Bigley's political foes joined forces to form a group called the Progress Committee to counteract Bigley's influence in the upcoming election. The committee's campaign manager, lawyer Harvey Miller, convinced Ernie Renzel, as well as Albert J. Ruffo and four other important San Josean figures, to run as an anti-Bigley ticket. The Progress Committee succeeded. Ernie Renzel was elected in 1944 and was selected as president of the city council in 1945. Renzel also assumed the then-unofficial title of Mayor of San Jose simultaneously. He remained mayor until 1946, when he was succeeded by Al Ruffo. Renzel remained in the city council for just one term in office. He spent the rest of his career as a \\"low-profile\\" citizen of influence in the larger San Jose community. Renzel explained why he chose this lower profile career in a 1980 interview, \\"Sometimes you can do more from the outside than the inside.\\" His influence and works extended beyond San Jose City Hall or San Jose International Airport. For example, Renzel used his influence to purchase a property in the 1960s for the San Jose Historical Landmarks Commission's historical museum. He was actively involved in several San Jose metropolitan area and Santa Clara County nonprofit groups throughout his lifetime. He served on the board of directors for such organizations as the San Jose Hospital, the Santa Clara County Civil Grand Jury and the Santa Clara County Housing Board. Death Ernie Renzel celebrated his 100th birthday in August 2007. He died on September 15, 2007, at his home in San Jose.

Adam Veyde began his military career in the so-called poteshnye voiska. He participated in both of the Azov campaigns, being a major of Preobrazhensky Lifeguard regiment in charge of engineer works during the siege of the Azov fortress. Enjoying Peter the Great's great confidence, Adam Veyde was frequently sent abroad on different important assignments and accompanied the tsar during all of his trips. For example, Veyde was dispatched to Hungary and Saxony in 1696 to notify their leaders of the falling of Azov. In 1698, he was sent to France and England to study military science. Upon his return, Adam Veyde presented a military charter composed by him (–í–æ–∏–Ω—Å–∫–∏–π —É—Å—Ç–∞–≤, also known as the Veyde Charter), in which he had set forth administrative and military rules for infantry regiments under formation, responsibilities of all military ranks (from private to commander-in-chief inclusively), the rules of conduct for all ranks under any circumstances, and drill procedures. Adam Veyde composed his charter under the influence of Louis XIV's legal provisions of military nature and organization of Eugene of Savoy's army, which had already earned fame by that time. The Veyde Charter formed the basis for the Peter the Great's Charter of 1716. Upon the disbandment of the Streltsy regiments, General Avtonom Golovin and Adam Veyde were ordered to form 18 infantry and 2 Dragoon regiments in Moscow in the fall of 1699. Also, Veyde was put in charge of teaching the marching drill to stolniks, stryapchiys (butlers), and zhiltsys (lowest category of the service class people). During the Great Northern War, Adam Veyde was assigned to command one of the 10-regiment divisions as part of Field Marshal Charles Eug√®ne de Cro√ø's army in 1700. After having approached Narva, Veyde's inexperienced division succumbed to the attacks of the Swedish army, albeit it managed to keep battle formation the longest among other Russian units. Adam Veyde himself was taken prisoner and sent to Stockholm, where he would remain until 1710 and then be exchanged for General Niels Jonsson Stromberg. While in captivity, Veyde observed the Swedes and the way their army was organized. During the Russo-Turkish War of 1710‚Äì1711, Adam Veyde commanded an 8-regiment division. In 1714, he was put in charge of 7 infantry and 3 cavalry regiments and dispatched to Finland. There, Veyde participated in the Battle of Gangut and commanded a galley with Peter the Great on board. For this victory, Adam Veyde was awarded the Order of St. Andrew and appointed commander of a grenadier regiment. Also, he assisted Peter the Great in his composing of the Military Charter of 1716 and two years later was appointed president of military collegium, for which he would elaborate the table of organization and charter. Adam Veyde died in 1720. Although he was Lutheran, Peter the Great ordered his interment at the Alexander Nevsky Lavra and attended his funeral personally.

She was arrested on September 28, 2007, and was charged with organized crime and conspiracy to drug trafficking. Some charges were later dropped but she was still held on possession of illegal weapons and money laundering, pending her extradition to the United States.SRE no descarta entregar a Avila (in Spanish) 10 August 2011 On August 10, 2012, she was extradited to the United States to answer to criminal charges by the U.S. government. Mexican and U.S. officials consider her as an important link between the Sinaloa Cartel in Mexico and the Colombian Norte del Valle Cartel. Biography √Åvila Beltr√°n was born in Baja California, Mexico, the daughter of Mar√≠a Luisa Beltr√°n F√©lix and Alfonso √Åvila Quintero, a family member of Rafael Caro Quintero, the former leader of the Guadalajara Cartel. Family connections have played a major role in her criminal career, having kinship with the Beltr√°n- Leyva Brothers, then top heads of the Sinaloa cartel \\"federation.\\" √Åvila Beltr√°n was in fact a \\"third-generation\\" drug trafficker in her family. Officials in Mexico say √Åvila Beltr√°n is the niece of Miguel √Ångel F√©lix Gallardo, the godfather and the boss of bosses of the Mexican drug trade who is now serving a 40-year sentence for his alleged involvement in the 1984 murder of Enrique Camarena, a U.S. Drug Enforcement Administration (DEA) special agent. Her great uncle Juan Jos√© Quintero Pay√°n was extradited to the United States on drug trafficking charges. On her mother's side, the Beltr√°ns got involved in heroin smuggling in the 1970s and later diversified into cocaine. DEA officials state that √Åvila Beltr√°n never shrank from employing the violence that comes with the turf and that \\"she used the typical intimidation tactics of Mexican organizations.\\" She reportedly had affairs with several well-known drug barons in her youth. She was married twice; both of her husbands were ex-police commanders who became drug traffickers and both were later killed by hired assassins. The police attribute her rise to power in the drug world primarily to her most recent relationship with Juan Diego Espinoza Ram√≠rez, alias The Tiger, who is said to be an important figure in the Colombian Norte del Valle Cartel. √Åvila Beltr√°n lived in Guadalajara, Jalisco, and Hermosillo, Sonora until the police found more than 9 tons of cocaine on a ship in the Pacific port of Manzanillo, Colima in 2001 and tracked the shipment to her and her lover Espinoza Ram√≠rez.  Arrest  Despite her high-profile lifestyle, Beltr√°n long avoided leaving police any evidence. In 2002, however, she unexpectedly contacted authorities for help when her teenage son was kidnapped for a US$5 million ransom. She eventually got her son back, but not without raising suspicions that launched an investigation. It took more than four years and 30 federal agents to close in and finally arrest √Åvila. She was arrested, along with Espinoza Ram√≠rez, on 28 September 2007, in Mexico City. She was charged with and convicted of laundering money for billions of dollars' worth of drugs smuggled from Colombia to Mexico. In a tape of her police interrogation, she describes herself as a housewife who earns a little money on the side \\"selling clothes and renting houses.\\" When asked why she had been arrested, she responded, \\"Because of an extradition order to the United States.\\" Her life behind bars at the Santa Martha Acatitla women's prison in Mexico City has apparently not been to her liking as she filed a complaint with a Mexico City human rights commission, saying her cell had insects, which she referred to as noxious fauna. She also said the ban on bringing in food from restaurants violated her human rights. In March 2009, journalist Anderson Cooper interviewed Sandra √Åvila for the television news magazine 60 Minutes. In January 2011 an investigation was launched after a doctor was allowed to enter the prison to give Beltr√°n a Botox injection treatment, a therapy that is not authorized for inmates. The prison's director and hospital chief were relieved of their duties. All of the drug charges were dropped in early 2011. As of February 2015 Sandra is free according to CNN \\"Now, after more than seven years behind bars, the woman known as \\"The Queen of the Pacific\\" is free. =Extradition and deportation= In June 2012 several Mexican judges ruled out major obstacles to extradite √Åvila Beltr√°n to the United States on cocaine trafficking charges that date back to 2001. Originally, previous requests seeking to extradite √Åvila Beltr√°n had been denied twice by a panel and then by a judge, but √Åvila Beltr√°n had to answer to the charges by the United States for several cocaine shipments seized in Chicago. On 10 August 2012, √Åvila Beltr√°n was extradited to the United States and flown to Florida to face cocaine possession and trafficking charges. √Åvila denied the charges and as part of the plea deal, √Åvila said she provided \\"financial assistance for travel, lodging, and other expenses\\" to Espinosa from 2002 to 2004. √Åvila Beltr√°n was then deported back to Mexico, where she was immediately arrested on money-laundering charges on 20 August 2013 and was sentenced to five more years in prison and a fine for money laundering. She was imprisoned at the Federal Social Readaptation Center No. 4 federal prison in Tepic, Nayarit.

Born in Bologna, Italy, Dimitri became an orphan at the age of 14. Living on the streets he remained in school until graduation. His interest in Satanist culture was seeded while he served in the military. In 1982 he became president of the cultural organization \\"Bambini di Satana,\\" a group with more than 1,000 members. He became known nationally when he participated in talk shows and various other programs. Dimitri expressed acrid criticism against the official Catholic culture in interviews with several newspapers, including Famiglia Cristiana. He was investigated on several occasions, but was repeatedly acquitted. Dimitri and his views have been discussed on CNN, the BBC, in the Australian ABC News, and in Japanese books. The BBC once labeled him \\"the most famous Satanist in Europe.\\"  Philosophy  Dimitri refutes any notion that his group are Satan worshippers, because \\"the cult of the Devil would be the cult of evil ‚Äì but for us, good and evil are subjective to each individual.\\" Satan, he asserts, is not about worshiping evil, rather it is a symbol of being an adversary, standing up to a repressive system. It is the church that is \\"repressive and forces man on his knees with laws that haven‚Äôt been created by Christ but by man to enrich man.\\"  Court cases  In 1996 Dimitri was accused of raping a two-year-old boy and a teenage girl in Satanic rituals, a case which sparked intense media attention. After 14 months in prison he was exonerated of all charges. Dimitri together with fellow Bambini di Satana members, Piergiorgio Bonora and Gennaro Luongo, were arrested on the charges of rape and fined for sexual assault, to which was later added violence against minors, violation of a tomb and desecration of a corpse. He rejected these allegations vigorously for more than a year while he was in police custody. In 1997 the court ruled that these incidents had never happened and acquitted Dimitri. Released from prison he continued his activities supported not only by Satanists but also by counterculturalists like the Luther Blissett Project as well as some writers and journalists. In 2001 the acquittal was appealed by public prosecutor Lucia Musti, who had led the unsuccessful prosecution in 1996. Dimitri was again acquitted, again due to lack of supporting evidence. In 2005 he was awarded compensation for unjust detention with the sum of 100,000 euros.  Countercultural activism  Dimitri continues to participate in television programs as well as doing interviews. He has created a web site with news and countercultural information. He collaborated with journalist Antonella Beccaria to write a book about his experiences with the 1996 case. The book, published by Stampa Alternativa publishing house under the title Bambini di Satana ‚Äì processo al diavolo i reati mai commessi di Marco Dimitri (process against the devil of crimes never committed by Marco Dimitri), and with a preface by crime-writer Carlo Lucarelli, is licensed as copyleft and distributed free on the Internet. Marco Dimitri is intent that the abuse must be uncovered and pursued.  Political activity and Democrazia Atea  In August 2012 Dimitri joined the Italian reformist party Democrazia Atea (DA). The party, led by astrophysicist Margherita Hack, shares Dimitri's disestablishmentarian views. In February 2013 he became the DA's candidate from Roma's district Lazio 2 for The Italian Parliament. A move that generated a lot of controversy and media coverage.  References   External links  The sect's atrocities?

Built by the Danubius shipyard between December 1912 and January 1915, Novara was the third and final member of her class to enter service, some six months after the start of the war. She was armed with a battery of nine guns and had a top speed of . The ship saw extensive service during World War I, owing to the cautious strategies adopted by the Austro- Hungarian fleet and their opponents in the Triple Entente. Novara was frequently used to raid enemy shipping and the Otranto Barrage, including a patrol in November 1915 where she destroyed a stranded French submarine. These operations culminated in the Battle of the Strait of Otranto in May 1917, the largest naval battle of the Adriatic Campaign. There, she and her two sisters sank fourteen drifters, though she was badly damaged by a British cruiser and had to be towed back to port. Novara was involved in the Cattaro Mutiny in January 1918 and led the loyalist vessels to safety. Novara changed hands several times as the war ended, being transferred first to the Kingdom of Yugoslavia, a successor state to Austria-Hungary, and then to France as a war prize under the terms of the Treaty of Saint-Germain-en-Laye. Commissioned into the French fleet as Thionville, the ship served from 1920 to 1932 as a training ship, and from 1932 to 1941 as a barracks ship in Toulon before being broken up for scrap.  Design  Novara was long overall, with a beam of and a mean draft of . She displaced at normal load, and up to at deep load. Her propulsion system consisted of two sets of AEG steam turbines driving two propeller shafts. They were designed to provide and were powered by 16 Yarrow water-tube boilers. These gave the ship a top speed of . Novara carried about of coal that gave her a range of approximately at . The ship had a crew of 340 officers and men.Fraccoli, p. 317Gardiner & Gray, p. 336 Novara was armed with nine 50-caliber guns in single pedestal mounts. Three were placed forward on the forecastle, four were located amidships, two on either side, and two were side by side on the quarterdeck. A ≈†koda /50 K10 anti-aircraft gun and six torpedo tubes in twin mounts were added in 1917. The navy planned to remove the guns on the forecastle and quarterdeck and replace them with a pair of guns fore and aft, but nothing was done before the end of the war. The ship was protected by a waterline armored belt that was thick amidships and a thick deck. The conning tower had 60 mm thick sides, and the guns had thick shields.  Service history  = Construction and early World War I = The launch of Novara Novara was laid down at the Danubius shipyard in Fiume on 9 December 1912, the last member of her class to begin construction. She was launched on 15 February 1913; the ship was still undergoing fitting-out work when World War I broke out in July 1914. The ship was completed on 10 January 1915 and commissioned into the Austro-Hungarian fleet. The commander of the Austro- Hungarian fleet, Admiral Anton Haus, adopted a cautious strategy to preserve his fleet, since he was outnumbered by the Anglo-French fleets in the Mediterranean, and the attitude of Austria-Hungary's erstwhile ally Italy remained unknown. Haus decided the best course of action would be to act as a fleet in being, which would tie down Allied naval forces, while torpedo boats, mines, and raids with fast cruisers like Novara could be used to reduce the numerical superiority of the enemy fleets before a decisive battle could be fought.Halpern, p. 141 In March, after the beginning of the British Dardanelles Campaign against the Ottoman Empire, Germany began to pressure Austria-Hungary to assist their ally; Haus considered sending Novara with a cargo of munitions. Haus ultimately decided the operation was too risky for what would have been a minimal gain, as the ship would not have been able to carry a particularly large amount.Sondhaus, p. 266 On 2 May, Novara towed the German U-boat from Pola out of the Adriatic Sea. They evaded French patrols until 6 May, off Cephalonia, they were spotted by a French vessel. Novara cut the tow and sped north, while UB-8 submerged and evaded the French patrol.Sondhaus, p. 268 Following the Italian declaration of war against the Central Powers on 23 May, the entire Austro-Hungarian fleet sortied to bombard Italian coastal targets. Novara took part in the operation; along with a destroyer and two torpedo boats, she bombarded Porto Corsini near Ravenna. Defensive fire from Italian coastal guns killed six men aboard Novara.Sondhaus, pp. 274‚Äì275 By late in the year, the Austro-Hungarian high command decided to begin attacking the Entente supply shipments being sent to Serbia via Albania. The first such raid, conducted by Novaras sister ships and , took place on the night of 22‚Äì23 November. The Austro-Hungarian fleet commander, Admiral Haus, transferred Novara, Helgoland, and six destroyers to Cattaro at the end of the month to facilitate further attacks. On 5 December, Novara, four destroyers, and three torpedo boats made an attack on the shipping lanes; they sank three transport ships and numerous fishing boats. While on their way back to Cattaro, they spotted the French submarine , which had run aground off the mouth of the Bojana river. Novara and the other vessels took the crew captive and destroyed the submarine.Halpern, p. 154 On 29 December, Novara, the cruiser , and the old coastal defense ship sortied to support Helgoland and six destroyers after they had run into a minefield, which sank a destroyer and badly damaged another. Novara and the other vessels did not reach Helgolands flotilla before they were able to disengage from pursuing Italian warships.Halpern, pp. 156‚Äì157 On 29 January 1916, Novara and two destroyers began another raid, this time on the port of Durrazo. While en route, the two destroyers collided and had to return to port, leaving just Novara to conduct the attack. Upon reaching the target, she encountered the Italian protected cruiser and a French destroyer. After a short engagement, Novara broke off the action and retreated, since the element of surprise was no longer available.Halpern, p. 158 Then-Linienschiffskapit√§n (Captain) Mikl√≥s Horthy, who commanded Novara at the time, launched an attack on the Otranto Barrage on 9 July. Novara sank a pair of drifters, damaged two more, and captured nine British sailors.Halpern, p. 161 = Battle of the Strait of Otranto = Novara in action with the British cruisers'' In February 1917, Horthy began preparations for a major raid on the drifters; he planned to use Novara and both of her sisters, which he modified to look like large British destroyers by cutting down their mainmasts. Each of the ships also received a 7 cm anti-aircraft gun, and their engines were thoroughly cleaned and repaired. While the preparations were being made in late April and early May, destroyers made several sweeps down to the coast of Albania to reconnoiter the Entente defenses in the area; they found none. On 13 May, Konteradmiral (Rear Admiral) Alexander Hansa issued the order to begin the operation the following morning.Koburger, p. 72 The three cruisers steamed south to the drifter line, arriving after night fall; at the same time, a pair of destroyers, and , mounted a diversionary attack off the coast of Albania. At around 03:30 on 15 May, Novara and the other cruisers opened fire on the drifters, sinking fourteen and damaging four more before they broke off the attack and withdrew, hoping to return to port before Entente forces could react.Halpern (1994), pp. 162‚Äì163 At 06:45, the British cruisers and and five Italian destroyers sortied to intercept Novara, Helgoland, and Saida. By 09:00, the faster British cruisers had caught up to the Austro-Hungarian vessels, and both sides called for reinforcements; a flotilla centered on the armored cruiser was sent to assist Horthy's cruisers. Dartmouth opened fire first and scored a hit on Novara, and the three Austro-Hungarian cruisers laid smoke screens and turned back toward their pursuers, scoring several hits on Dartmouth in the process. Novara was hit several more times, and her main feed pumps and starboard auxiliary steam pipe were damaged, which caused the ship to begin losing speed. Horthy was badly injured as well, though he remained in command. At 11:05, the Entente commander, Admiral Alfredo Acton, turned away in an attempt to separate Saida from Novara and Helgoland. At this point, Sankt Georg was approaching the scene, which prompted Acton to temporarily withdraw to consolidate his forces. This break in the action was enough time for the Austro-Hungarians to save the crippled Novara; Saida took the ship under tow while Helgoland covered them.Halpern (1994), pp. 163‚Äì164Sondhaus, p. 306 Unaware that Novara had been disabled, and fearing that his ships would be drawn too close to the Austrian naval base at Cattaro, Acton broke off the pursuit. The destroyer Acerbi misread the signal, and attempted to launch a torpedo attack, but was driven off by the combined fire of Novara, Saida, and Helgoland. At 12:05, Acton realized the dire situation Novara was in, but by this time, the Sankt Georg group was too close. The Sankt Georg group rendezvoused with Novara, Saida, and Helgoland, and Csepel and Balaton reached the scene as well. The entire group returned to Cattaro together.Halpern (1994), p. 165 = End of the war = Novara sometime during World War I By early 1918, the long periods of inactivity had begun to wear on the crews of several warships at Cattaro, primarily those of the little-used armored cruisers. On 1 February, the Cattaro Mutiny broke out, starting aboard Sankt Georg. They then rapidly gained control of the cruiser and most of the other major warships in the harbor.Halpern (2004), pp. 48‚Äì50 The crews of Novara and Helgoland resisted the mutiny,Koburger, p. 96 with the latter preparing their ship's torpedoes but Sankt Georgs gunners aimed their guns at Helgoland, which convinced them to back down. Novaras commander, Prince Johann of Liechtenstein, initially refused to allow a rebel party to board his vessel, but after Kaiser Karl VI trained her guns on Novara, he relented and let the crew fly a red flag in support of the mutiny. Liechtenstein and Erich von Heyssler, the commander of Helgoland, plotted overnight how to extricate their vessels, their crews having abstained from actively supporting the rebels.Halpern (2004), p. 50 The following day, many of the mutinous ships abandoned the effort and rejoined loyalist forces in the inner harbor after shore batteries opened fire on the rebel guard ship . Liechtenstein tore down the red flag before ordering his ship to escape into the inner harbor; they were joined by the other scout cruisers and most of the torpedo boats, followed by several of the other larger vessels. There, they were protected by shore batteries that opposed the rebellion. By late in the day, only the men aboard Sankt Georg and a handful of destroyers and torpedo boats remained in rebellion. The next morning, the s arrived from Pola and put down the uprising.Halpern (2004), pp. 52‚Äì53Sondhaus, p. 322 On 3 November 1918, the Austro-Hungarian government signed the Armistice of Villa Giusti with Italy, ending their participation in the conflict.Gardiner & Gray, p. 329 Following the armistice, the entire Austro-Hungarian fleet was transferred to the newly formed Yugoslavia.Halpern (1994), p. 177 = French service = In 1920, under the terms of the Treaty of Saint-Germain-en-Laye, Novara and the rest of the fleet was surrendered to the Allied powers as war prizes;Sondhaus, pp. 359‚Äì360 Novara was awarded to France in the post-war distribution of ships. She sprang a leak in the Adriatic and put into Brindisi, Italy, where she sank on 29 January 1920. She was refloated in early April 1920. The ship was renamed Thionville and incorporated into the French fleet after repairs. Thionville was assigned to the torpedo school for use as a training ship, a role she filled until 1 May 1932.Jordan & Moulin, p. 167 The ship was then disarmed and converted into a barracks ship based in Toulon. She remained there until 1941, when she was broken up for scrap.

It is a representation of the ending of Alfred, Lord Tennyson's 1832 poem of the same name. Waterhouse painted three versions of this character, in 1888, 1894 and 1915. It is one of his most famous works, which adopted much of the style of the Pre-Raphaelite Brotherhood, though Waterhouse was painting several decades after the Brotherhood split up during his early childhood. The Lady of Shalott was donated to the public by Sir Henry Tate in 1894 and is usually on display in Tate Britain, London, in room 1840. Description The Lady of Shalott an 1888 oil-on-canvas painting, is one of John William Waterhouse's most famous works. It depicts a scene from Tennyson's poem in which the poet describes the plight and the predicament of a young woman, loosely based on the figure of Elaine of Astolat from medieval Arthurian legend, who yearned with an unrequited love for the knight Sir Lancelot, isolated under an undisclosed curse in a tower near King Arthur's Camelot. Waterhouse painted three versions of this character, in 1888, 1894 and 1915. The painting has the precisely painted detail and bright colours associated with the Pre-Raphaelites. It pictures the titular character of Tennyson's poem, also titled The Lady of Shalott (1842). In the poem, the Lady had been confined to her quarters, under a curse that forbade her to go outside or even look directly out of a window; her only view of the world was through a mirror. She sat below the mirror and wove a tapestry of scenes she could see by the reflection. After defying the curse by looking out the window at Camelot, the Lady has made her way to a small boat. This is the moment that is pictured in Waterhouse's painting, as the Lady is leaving to face her destiny. She is pictured sitting on the tapestry she has woven. The Lady has a lantern at the front of her boat and a crucifix is positioned near the bow. Next to the crucifix are three candles. Candles were a representation of life ‚Äì two of the candles are already blown out, signifying that her death is soon to come. Aside from the metaphoric details, this painting is valued for Waterhouse's realistic painting abilities. The Lady's dress is stark white against the much darker hues of the background. Waterhouse's close attention to detail and colour, the accentuation of the beauty of nature, realist quality, and his interpretation of her vulnerable, wistful face are further demonstration of his artistic skill. Naturalistic details include a pied flycatcher and the water plants that would be found in a river in England at this time. The Lady of Shalott was donated to the public by Sir Henry Tate in 1894. Tennyson's poem According to Tennyson's version of the legend, the Lady of Shalott was forbidden to look directly at reality or the outside world; instead she was doomed to view the world through a mirror, and weave what she saw into tapestry. Her despair was heightened when she saw loving couples entwined in the far distance and she spent her days and nights aching for a return to normal. One day the Lady's mirror revealed Sir Lancelot passing by on his horse. When she impetuously took three paces across the room and looked at him, the mirror cracked and she realised that the curse had befallen her. The lady escaped by boat during an autumn storm, inscribing 'The Lady of Shalott' on the prow. As she sailed towards Camelot and certain death, she sang a lament. Her frozen body was found shortly afterwards by the knights and ladies of Camelot, one of whom is Lancelot, who prayed to God to have mercy on her soul. From part IV of Tennyson's poem: Tennyson also reworked the story in Elaine, part of his Arthurian epic Idylls of the King, published in 1859, though in this version the Lady is rowed by a retainer in her final voyage. Other versions Tennyson's verse was popular with many of the Pre- Raphaelite poets and painters and was illustrated by such artists as Dante Gabriel Rossetti, William Maw Egley, and William Holman Hunt. Throughout his career, Waterhouse was preoccupied with the poetry of both Tennyson and John Keats. Between 1886 and 1915 Waterhouse painted three episodes from the poem, as well as La Belle Dame sans Merci (1893) from the poem by John Keats.

The Swedish officers in black are militarised Police/Gendarmerie, and the men in the foreground wearing tan are army soldiers. The Swedish extradition of Baltic soldiers, in Sweden known as the Extradition of the Balts (), is a controversial political event that took place in 1945‚Äì1946, when Sweden extradited some 150 Latvian and Estonian Waffen-SS volunteers and conscripts who had been drafted and recruited by Germany to fight against the Soviet Union during World War II. Background and extradition process On 2 June 1945, the Soviet Union demanded that Sweden extradite all Axis soldiers. The government protocol from 15 June was kept secret until it became public on 19 November. It was supported by most of the parliament and the Swedish Communist Party wanted to go further, by extraditing all civilian refugees from Estonia, Latvia, and Lithuania. The majority of the Baltic soldiers extradited were Latvians (149 out of 167) who had escaped from the Courland Pocket. When they reached Sweden, those in uniform were detained in detention camps. The extradition to the Soviet Union took place on 25 January 1946 in the port of Trelleborg for transportation on the steamer Beloostrov. On return they were briefly put in a camp in Liepaja and later released. According to one source at least 50 of the Latvians were arrested between 1947 and 1954 and were sentenced, often to 10‚Äì15 years in prison. Sweden also extradited about 3,000 German soldiers, according to laws on prisoners of war. The people from the Baltic states were however more controversial since the Soviet authorities viewed them as Soviet citizens (the Soviet Union had occupied the independent Baltic states in 1940) and therefore regarded the people from the Baltic states as traitors, and the internees feared death sentences. Two Latvian officers committed suicide. Of the prisoners, Lieutenant Colonel KƒÅrlis Gailƒ´tis and Captain Ernsts Keselis were sentenced to death but had their sentences changed to 17 years hard labour. Three others of lower ranks were sentenced to death and executed in 1946.  Subsequent events  In 1970, Johan Bergenstr√•hle made a film, A Baltic Tragedy, about the subject. The film is based on Per Olov Enquist‚Äôs Legion√§rerna: En roman om baltutl√§mningen (1968) (English title: The Legionnaires: A Documentary Novel) which had won the Nordic Council's Literature Prize and Enquist collaborated on the script. On 20 June 1994, 40 of the 44 surviving extradited (35 Latvians, 4 Estonians, and 1 Lithuanian) accepted an invitation to visit Sweden. They were received by King Carl XVI Gustaf of Sweden at the Royal Palace in Stockholm. The Swedish Minister of Foreign Affairs Margaretha af Ugglas said that the Swedish government agreed with the criticism of the decision and regretted the injustice.See Svenska Dagbladet 21 and 22 June 1994, and Dagens Nyheter 21 and 22 June 1994 A memorial, \\"stranded refugee ship\\" (1999‚Äì2000) by Christer Bording, has been erected in Trelleborg.\\"Strandad flyktingb√•t\\", at Christer Bording websiteFlyktingminnesv√•rd i Trelleborg .

Its purpose is a) to guide a larger drill to the appropriate location and ease the job of the larger drill, b) to allow for the insertion of another hole-making tool, such as a knockout punch, that will produce the final-sized hole, or c) to locate, guide, and provide clearance for a self-threading screw in wood or plastic to prevent damaging the material or breaking the screw.  Pilot for large holes  A pilot hole may be drilled the full extent of the final hole, or may only be a portion of the final depth. The pilot drill may be a standard twist drill, another type of drill bit appropriate for the material, or, when the primary purpose is precisely locating a hole, may be made with a short, stiff center drill. The pilot hole also reduces the power needed to turn a large drill bit, and reduces the large bit breakage risk. For twist drill bits, the pilot size is usually selected so that the chisel point of the larger drill does not need to remove any material, which reduces the chance of splitting the web of the bit. A pilot thus sized also prevents a larger drill bit from slipping on the material and guides the larger bit effectively. Very large holes may be stepped by drilling successively larger pilot holes before the final size drill is used. On harder materials, such as most metals and many plastics, and sometimes on softer materials like wood, a center punch is used before drilling the pilot hole to ensure that the smaller pilot drill bit does not slip and that it starts at the correct location.  Pilot holes for screws  Pilot holes may be used when driving a screw, typically in wood, concrete, or plastic where the screw cuts its own threads. When a screw is driven into a material without a pilot hole, it can act as a wedge, generating outward pressure which can cause many materials to split. By drilling a small pilot hole into the material, into which a screw is then driven, less wedging takes place, thereby reducing the likelihood of the material being split. When a screw is driven without a pilot hole, or with too small a pilot hole, the core of the screw may bind and lead to the screw being broken. The appropriate pilot hole will prevent binding while providing sufficient friction to keep the screw from loosening. For common wood screws, the pilot providing clearance for the core of the screw may be followed by a larger bit to shallower depth to provide clearance for the larger, unthreaded shank of the screw. For standard wood screws, special pilot drill bits are manufactured to produce the correct hole profile in a single operation, rather than needing several different drill bit sizes and depths. Screws driven into concrete must have the appropriate size pilot hole, or they will either break on insertion, strip the hole, or not provide the rated holding force.TAPCON reference material retrieved 2013AUG9 A hole drilled for tapping machine screws or bolt threads in metal or plastic may also be referred to as a pilot hole.

Initially, Nemesea were a symphonic gothic metal act, and were compared to Dutch compatriots After Forever.Archaic-Magazine.com :: Mana :: Nemesea/ However, since 2007's In Control, the band's music has become more rock-oriented, also incorporating strong electronic influences. Biography =Early years= Following a three-song demo, Nemesea had their first performance as support act for After Forever in the P60 Amstelveen and remained that band's support for a year. They attracted record company interest and signed for the Dutch independent label Ebony Tears in November 2003. =Mana= In November 2004, Nemesea released their debut album Mana, touring the Netherlands, Belgium and other European countries extensively until December 2005. By this time, they were well-established in the European gothic/symphonic metal scene. =In Control and Pure Live @ P3= For their second album, Nemesea had talks with major record labels, but later decided to sign up to the Dutch crowdsourcing website Sellaband. They were the first band to raise more than $50,000 from fans in a three-month period. The album In Control, mixed by Ronald Prent and co-produced by Tony Platt was released on June 21, 2007. A distribution deal was made with Rough Trade Records to bring the new album to music stores in Benelux on October 26, 2007. The band signed also a booking deal with Dutch agent AT Productions and found a new manager in David Arden, brother of Sharon Osbourne and former manager of James Brown. In 2009 a live album was released following the band's performances at the P3 in Purmerend. The two live shows were set up in full 9.2 omni surround to give the audience the feeling they were \\"immersed in sound\\". The live album Pure Live@P3 was released on September 7, 2009. The album was later on remixed and re-released as part of a special 5.1 surround album bundled with the 5.1 surround version of In Control with Ronald Prent again in charge of the 5.1 surround mix. =The Quiet Resistance= In 2010 Nemesea signed with the Austrian music label Napalm Records and preparations for their new album began, resulting in Nemesea's third studio album The Quiet Resistance, released November 2011. In July 2010, the band announced they were recording their third studio album, which they hoped would be early late 2011. On a tight budget, recording at their home studio, new elements were added to the Nemesea sound developed on both previous albums. This resulted in more synth heavy, somewhat darker, bigger sound with melodic arrangements. The new song \\"Caught in the Middle\\" was posted on YouTube, and was added to the track list of The Quiet Resistance. The album's 14 songs contain three duets, one with Charlotte Wessels (Delain), one with BulletProof Messenger members Marcus Klavan (vocals) and Matt Litwin (DJ) and another one with vocalist Heli Rei√üenweber from Maerzfeld. For drums Nemesea attracted Frank van der Star and for keyboards/DJ Lasse Dellbr√ºgge. The band reached out to producer and mix engineer Joost van den Broek for production and mix. The album was met with positive reviews and The Quiet Resistance helped grow Nemesea's fan base. \\"Afterlife\\" was released as a single and video and after the release Nemesea toured extensively in Holland and Germany. =Uprise= On August 9, 2012, guitarist Hendrik Jan de Jong posted a photo on his Facebook timeline stating that the band had officially started working on their yet to be named fourth studio album. On April 2, 2015 the band began with early pre-production that resulted in three new songs in Key Studio's and Mastersound studios. The band posted the front cover of the album on their Facebook page on January 28, 2016, the stating that it would be called Uprise and the release date would be April 29, 2016. This was also announced by Blabbermouth.net. Uprise was recorded at the Giesound-studios in Zwolle. Producer Guido Aalbers (Muse, Coldplay, No Doubt) played a crucial role. Nemesea pushed for a more natural, organic, pure sound while avoiding over-production and adding electronics as a flavour this time. Former Nemesea drummer Steven Bouma joined Nemesea again in the studio. From the album 'Twilight' was released as a lyric video and 'Forever' released as a single and video on YouTube. According to the press Uprise is the testimony of Nemesea reminiscing after an emotional chapter of hanging on to the past whilst dealing with a new reality and allowing oneself (as well as others) to make the next step. With Uprise Nemesea has evolved from a metal band to a rock band with songs to match. =New singer= On August 1, 2016, Manda reported on Facebook that she is \\"giving up [her] dream of being a singer\\" and therefore has left the band. Later the same day the band reported on their homepage that Manda was going to focus on \\"her education job with highly gifted children\\". Nemesea also stated that they will continue as a band and that their previous drummer Steven Bouma had rejoined the band. In September 2016 Nemesea played on a festival in De Oosterpoort in Groningen, Netherlands. The festival was hosted by De Oosterpoort together with the record store Plato. The performance featured 5 different vocalists as Nemesea played various songs from the album Uprise. On October 10, 2016 Nemesea started the search for a new singer via social media, a newsletter and their website. On May 19, 2017 Nemesea released their first single with new singer Sanne Mieloo called \\"Dance In The Fire\\". A music video was released on YouTube by Napalm Records on June 1, 2017. Mieloo also occasionally played the role of Kala in the Dutch musical version of Tarzan and even appeared on the 2018 re-release of Andreas Nerg√•rd's The Haunted, taken from the 2018 re- release of his album Memorial for a Wish. = Uprise - singles re-release = In November 2017, a new version of \\"Hear Me\\", and in March 2018, a new version of \\"Twilight\\", both taken from the album Uprise, were released. Both songs were remixed and remastered and feature Sanne Mieloo on vocals. Additionally new samples and keyboard parts were added by Matthijs van Til. =White Flag= On June 24th, the single Kids With Guns, taken from the upcoming album White Flag, was released. Napalm Records released a teaser before uploading the complete song to YouTube. On July 22nd the second single -Fools Gold- was released. The release included a lyric video which was uploaded to Youtube. The 3rd and final single -White Flag- was released on August 19. That release also included a lyric video. = White Flag album = On august the 23rd the full album -White Flag- was released. The album contains 14 songs including -Dance In The Fire-, a single that was released in 2017. Recording (drums, percussion and bass guitar) partly took place in an empty house with the drums set up in the kitchen. Vocals, keys and guitar were partly recorded at different locations. Mixing was done by Joost van den Broek who also mixed -The Quiet Resistance-. Mastering was done by Darius van Helfteren. = New Year's Day - single = On 1-1-2020 Nemesea released a single with HJ on vocals named \\"New year's day\\". A lyric video was released on Youtube. Quote from the band: \\"Powerful words about faith & persistence that can bring people (back) together. This really spoke to us and is something we can relate to. Our New Years gift in 2020. Recorded in an abandoned house in 1 day\\" = WakeUP! - single = On 5-1-2020 Nemesea announced the release of a new single \\"Wake UP!\\" on their social media pages.

It is located near the Russian River resort town of Guerneville, California, about north of San Francisco. Situated on a hilltop above the Armstrong Redwoods State Reserve, Pond Farm began around 1939-40 when a San Francisco- based couple named Gordon and Jane Herr (architect and writer, respectively) acquired a portion of property called Rancho Del Lago or the Walker Ranch. Initially , their property was later expanded to . Because one of its primary features was a large pond, the Herrs renamed this setting Pond Farm. It includes two small residences and a historic barn repurposed as a pottery studio. Workshops Inspired by such precedents as the Bauhaus, Eliel Saarinen‚Äôs Cranbrook Academy of Art, Black Mountain College, and Frank Lloyd Wright‚Äôs Taliesin, the Herrs envisioned Pond Farm as an artists‚Äô community that would in part support itself through summer workshops. According to their son (Jonathan Herr), Gordon Herr regarded Pond Farm as ‚Äúa sustainable sanctuary for artists away from a world gone amuck,‚Äù while for Jane Herr, ‚Äúit was a new beginning after rejecting conventional city upbringing‚Äù (Schwarz 2007, p. 315). Working together, the Herrs became able practitioners of homestead farming. They raised a wide variety of livestock; planted fruit orchards, nut trees and vegetable gardens; and established several fish ponds. In 1939, Gordon Herr traveled to Europe to search for artists whose beliefs and personalities might be compatible with his own. While in Putten, the Netherlands, he met the proprietors of the Het Kruike (Little Jug) pottery shop. They were Frans Wildenhain and his wife Marguerite Wildenhain (n√©e Friedlaender), who had moved to Holland from Germany, where both had studied pottery at the Weimar Bauhaus. Herr urged them to emigrate to the U.S., in order to become a part of Pond Farm Workshops. The Wildenhains hesitated initially, but only six months later, when the Nazis invaded Poland, they wrote to Herr, asking if his offer stood. It did, and on March 3, 1940, Marguerite departed for the U.S. Her husband, however, was left behind, because the quota for German citizens had been filled. She was Jewish, he was not. Eventually, Marguerite Wildenhain ended up in California and (having explored other options) decided to join the Herrs‚Äô Pond Farm Workshops. She moved to Pond Farm in 1942, helped to put in water lines, established a garden, built a house and, working with Gordon Herr, restored and redesigned a barn that became her pottery workshop. Later, in 1949, on property adjacent to the entrance of the Armstrong Redwood Forest, the Herrs began construction of a building called the Hexagon House, where students could be housed and fed, and where public gatherings could be held. Resident artists Marguerite Wildenhain was the first artist to accept the Herrs‚Äô invitation to join the Pond Farm Workshops. In 1947, they were joined by Frans or Franz Wildenhain, who, having been drafted into the German Army during World War II, had been separated from his wife for seven years. Franz would teach sculpture, while two other European artists who joined the colony in 1949, Trude Guermonprez and Victor Ries, taught weaving and metals, respectively. Gordon Herr taught architecture, and Jane Herr served as an informal business manager. In addition to the resident artists, others participated as visiting artists and instructors, including Jean Varda (collage), David Stewart (painting), Claire Falkenstein (painting), Lucienne Bloch (fresco), Stephen Dimitroff (fresco), Harry Dixon (metals) and others. It appears that the Workshop's first summer session took place in 1949. Unfortunately, it would close only a few years later in 1953. Given the strong survival instincts of the artists, they soon proved incompatible. In the words of Tim Tivoli Steele (the Herrs‚Äô grandson), ‚ÄúIn the end, the trait that all the artists had relied on to survive the war and follow their visions‚Äîthe strength of their personalities‚Äîwould also contribute to the demise of the Workshops. Constant bickering tore the group apart‚Äù (Steele 1992, p. 3). Around the same time period, one of the Herr children died of mushroom poisoning, the Wildenhains‚Äô volatile marriage collapsed, and Jane Herr developed breast cancer and died in 1952. Pottery When Pond Farm Workshops fell apart in 1953, nearly all the residents left. Thereafter, a school and workshop on the site, called Pond Farm Pottery, were carried on by the community's only remaining artist, Bauhaus potter Marguerite Wildenhain, who continued to offer instruction through 1980. Wildenhain was known for being thorough in her teachings, making newcomers start with dog dishes and learning all of the throwing steps before moving on to more advanced pottery.Article from Deneen Pottery Among her students was Dean Schwarz, co-founder of South Bear School, who studied at Pond Farm during the 1960s. University of Utah Professor of Art, Dorothy Bearnson, participated in seven summer workshops with Wildenhain between 1947 and 1964. As early as 1963, the State of California had used its powers of ‚Äúeminent domain‚Äù to require Pond Farm residents to sell their property to the State, in order to expand the Austin Creek State Recreation Area. Gordon Herr was forced to move, but, in response to appeals by her students, it was decided that Wildenhain could continue to live on the property until her death.  Designations and state ownership  When Wildenhain died in 1985, her property reverted to the State of California and became part of Austin Creek State Recreation Area. In 2013, the site was awarded $443,245 in Prop 84 Cultural Stewardship funding to stabilize and the house and barn. The site has been designated a \\"National Treasure\\" by the National Trust for Historic Preservation. The complex was added to the National Register of Historic Places in 2014.

Sawai Madhavrao Peshwa or Madhav Rao II Narayan) was the 12th Peshwa of the Maratha Empire in India, from his infancy. He was known as Sawai Madhav Rao or Madhav Rao Narayan. He was the posthumous son of Narayanrao Peshwa, murdered in 1773 on the orders of Raghunathrao. Madhavrao II was considered the legal heir, and was installed as Peshwa by the Treaty of Salbai in 1782. Early life Madhavrao II was the posthumous son of Peshwa Narayanrao by his wife, Gangabai. After Narayanrao's murder by Raghunathrao's supporters he became the Peshwa but was soon deposed by the courtiers and knights of the Maratha Empire. They instead installed Gangabai's new born son, Madhavrao II, as the Peshwa with the courtiers, led by Nana Fadnavis, as the Regents. Madhavrao II was made Peshawa when he was barely 40 days old. His time in power was dominated by the political intrigues of Nana Fadnavis. His father Narayan Rao became Peshwa in 1772 and later he was murdered by the supporters of Raghunath Rao (Raghoba). During this time Peshwa Narayan Rao‚Äôs wife was pregnant. In such situation Raghunath Rao became the Peshwa in 1773, for the time being. She gave birth to a male child. The subjects of the state became happy as they heard that the widow queen had given birth to the male child who would be the next Peshwa. Acting Peshwa Raghunath Rao (Raghoba) couldn‚Äôt do anything before the wit and wisdom of Nana Phadnavis. The male child was named as Sawai Madhav Rao II and declared as the Peshwa of Pune. There was a lot of resentment among the people of the state against the cruel murder of the Peshwa Narayan Rao and held a judicial enquiry under the leadership of the renowned justice Ramshastri Prabhune. He pointed out that the acting Peshwa Raghunath Rao (Raghoba) was the prime author of the murder. As the result of it, the responsible ministers of the royal court and leaders of Maratha empire formed a council of state known as Bara Bhai for the conduct of the affairs of the state. Bara Bhai began to conduct the affairs of the state on the name of Sawai Madhav Rao II as he was a minor. Reign =First Anglo-Maratha War= After the British loss in 1782 in the First Anglo-Maratha War, Mahadji Shinde got Madhvrao recognized as Peshwa by the British. However, all powers of the Peshwa were in the hands of ministers like Nana Fadnavis, Mahadaji Shinde and others. =Involvement in Anglo-Mysore Wars= Mysore had been attacking the Maratha Confederacy since 1761. To counter the menace presented by Mysore's Hyder Ali and Tipu Sultan the Peshwa supported the English. During the Third Anglo-Mysore War the British East India Company was alarmed by the strength and the gains made by the Maratha Confederacy not just against Mysore but also in India. =Chaos in Delhi, Mughal Darbar= In 1788, Ghulam Qadir attacked Delhi, Mahadaji Shinde led the army of Marathas to Delhi and saved the Mughal Emperor and his family. =Subjugation of Rajput= In 1790, the Marathas won over Rajput States in the Battle of Patan. After the death of Mahadaji Shinde In 1794, the Maratha power got concentrated in the hands of Nana Fadnavis. =Zoo= Madhavrao was fond of the out-doors and had a private collection of exotic animals such as lions and rhinoceros. The area where he hunted became later the Peshwe park zoo in Pune. He was particularly fond of his herd of trained dancing deer. Death Madhavrao committed suicide at the age of 21 by jumping off from the high walls of the Shaniwar Wada in Pune.Marathas (Peshwas) The cause of the suicide probably was that he could not endure the highhandedness of Nana Fadnavis. Just before his suicide, it is said that in ordering the execution of the despised police commissioner, Ghashiram Kotwal, Madhavrao was able to defy the wishes of Nana for the first time Kotani, H., 2005.

J.R.R. Tolkien at Gregans Castle in 1954 with owner Frank Martyn and his partner Suzette Crowe Gregans Castle is the name applied to both a 15th-century tower house and a Georgian-style house in the Burren region of County Clare, Ireland, near the village of Ballyvaughan. The latter dates from 1750 and is associated with the Martyn and O'Lochlainn (or O'Loughlen) families. The tower house is across the road from the modern house, which is now a hotel. Location Gregans Castle lies in the Ballyvaughan valley of the Burren, a unique region that contains grey limestone terraces, a very high concentration of alpine, mediterranean and arctic flowers, particularly orchids, ancient burial tombs, stone forts and ecclesiastical ruins. History The 15th/16th century tower house was the seat of the chief of the O'Lochlainn (or O'Loughlen) family, called the \\"Prince of Burren\\". Until the end of the 16th century the area was referred to as \\"the Barony of Gragans\\" (probably derived from the word for mountain bog, an area of which is present on the hills to the west of the castle). Owney More O'Loughlen was proprietor of Gregans in 1641. In the Cromwellian Settlement which came after 1654, he was dispossessed. The land was then granted to the Martyn family. It is unclear, however, whether the lands did leave the O'Loughlen family: In 1632, Turlough O'Loughlen had married Alice Martyn, daughter of George Martyn (Mayor of Galway 1632-1633), and it was their son, George Oge, using the name Martyn, to whom the lands were granted. (Though according to the Martyn family genealogy by Martin J. Blake, George Oge was the eldest son George Martyn, Mayor of Galway.) Apparently the Martyns built another fortified structure near the old tower house, rather than using the existing tower house. Eventually, they moved to the two-storied house in the location of today's hotel. An early member of the Martyn family is recorded as having been killed at the Battle of Aughrim in 1691 at the end of the Jacobite wars. Later the family were prominent in the legal profession and lived mainly in Dublin. The house at Gregans seems to have been retained as a summer retreat in later years and most of the of land were let. In 1866, after contracting a most profitable marriage, Capt. John Gregory Martyn J.P., came to live permanently at Gregans. Capt. Martyn was a supporter of Charles Stewart Parnell and Home Rule for Ireland. The house was extended considerably at this time. After his death, his son Francis Florence Martyn remained at Gregans and farmed a much reduced estate. During these times of economic depression, the house fell into some disrepair and the unmarried Frank, locally thought of as an eccentric, died in 1956. In fact, in the 1940s, Frank even tried his hand at innkeeping and obtained a bar license. After he died, his housekeeper, Miss Crowe continued to live in the house and eventually, the trustees sold the house for conversion to an hotel. The oldest surviving feature of the house is the former kitchen fireplace with crest keystone in what is now the Martyn Suite. In 1967 the house opened as Gregans Castle Hotel. The Martyn Suite, the kitchen before the house was converted to a luxury hotel. Today The Georgian residence is still operated as a hotel. The tower house has been restored from its ruinous state and is now a private residence.

The sport has accrued a considerable amount of jargon to describe aspects of the game. Many terms originate from the Laws of the Game. A number of aspects of the game have more than one term that refers to them. Different terms have become popularly used to describe an aspect of the game in different places with notable differences between the northern and southern hemispheres. Where words in a sentence are also defined elsewhere in this article, they appear in italics. 0‚Äì9 : Every time a player is tackled, all defenders, apart from a maximum of two markers, have to retreat 10 metres from the play-the-ball area. : A player selected as a back- up to the official 17 man squad for a game. The 18th man usually warms up with the team prior to a match and may be called into the team if one of the 17 players is injured or ill prior to the start of the match. The term is also sometimes used informally to refer to a team's supporters, and the squad number 18 may even be reserved for this purpose. : If a player standing no more than 40 metres away from his own try line manages to a kick a ball in general play which bounces in the field of play then goes into touch inside his opponents, 20-metre area, his side restart the game with a tap 20m from the touchline and level with where the ball went out of play but no closer than 10m to the defending team's goal line. A : The defender in the defensive line that is immediately to the right or left of the play-the-ball. : One determinant of a dangerous tackle. Defenders lifting an attacking player off the ground to the point when their feet are higher than their head. Lifting a player this way can be a precursor to the outlawed spear tackle. : \\"Advantage\\" is the period of time after an infringement, in which the non- offending side have the opportunity to gain sufficient territory or tactical opportunity to negate the need to stop the game due to the infringement. The referee will signal advantage with their arm out horizontally, toward the non- infringing team. If no tactical or territorial advantage is gained, the referee will whistle, and give the decision that had been delayed. If sufficient advantage is gained, the referee will call \\"advantage over\\", and play will continue. The Advantage Law allows the game to flow more freely, and not stop for every minor infringement. : It is an imaginary line across the pitch when there is a breakdown in open play, i.e. a play-the-ball, scrum. Advancing across the advantage line represents a gain in territory. Also called the \\"gain line\\". : See Round the corner kicking B : A type of tackle preventing the player (who is being tackled) being able to offload the ball to a team mate, who might, before the tackle has been completed, carry on the attack. This type of tackle involves preventing the player being tackled from being able to move their arms effectively. : The player in possession of the ball. : An instance in which a tackle can be judged to be complete is when the attacking player's ball-carrying arm is touching the ground at the same time that a defending player is in contact with the attacker. If the ball enters touch, then play is restarted by a scrum at the point where the ball left the field of play. The exception is when the ball is kicked into touch without first bouncing inside the field of play (on the full). In this case, the scrum is taken from level with the place from where the ball was kicked from. The ball is given back to the team who did not kick it out of bounds; ball back is waived in certain circumstances: # If a side elects to kick a penalty into touch : A medium-range kick performed in general play that goes to off to the side of the kicker rather than in front, for chasers further afield. The aim of the banana kick is to be less predictable than conventional kicks and is named such thus as the rise and fall of the ball is in a curve like that of a banana. : Fighting. : The underside of the crossbar connecting the goal posts will have a marking on it in the centre, usually black in colour, that is referred to as the \\"black dot\\". The black dot can be used as an aid to kickers with their aiming. A player scoring a try in the centre of the goal line or in goal, that is beneath the posts, might be said to have scored \\"under the black dot\\". : The narrow side of the pitch in relation to a scrum or a play the ball; the opposite of openside. : See: Interchange : See: Bomb (kick) : A breach of the line of defenders by the player in possession of the ball on the attacking team. : Bridging refers to a team linking or binding players together at the play-the-ball into a scrum-like formation. : Broken- time payments compensated players for the time they missed from work due to their rugby playing commitments. The use of these payments was one of the issues that led to the schism of rugby football in England. Broken-time payments were the original player payment system of the Northern Rugby Football Union in 1895. : A bust, or tackle bust, is when a player breaks through an attempted tackle. C : A dangerous tackle in which a defender attacks the legs of a stationary, standing player who is being held upright by other tacklers. : See: team warning : The centres, or 'centre three-quarters', (numbered 3 and 4) are positioned one in from the wings and together complete what is known as the three-quarter line. They are divided into left and right centres. : Usually the best mixture of power and vision, their main role is to try to create attacking opportunities for their team and defend those of the opposition. Along with the wingers, the centres score plenty of tries throughout a season. : Another term for handover. : The blocking of an attacker's kick as it rises from the foot. Done with outstretched arms and hands, this is not a knock-on.RLIF, 2004: 22 : : A shoulder lock wrestling technique, often used to slow down the play-the-ball, that places \\"undue pressure\\" on joints of players. It is punishable under Section 15, Law 1 (i) of the Laws of the Game as it is deemed \\"contrary to the true spirit of the game\\".RLIF, 2004: 38 : A feature of the Super League play-offs between 2009 and 2014 in which the highest ranked team from the regular season table to win their match in the first week of the play-offs was able to select their opponents for their next game, a qualifying semi-final in week three, from the teams that won their preliminary semi-final in week two. : The percentage of times in possession that a team holds the ball for a full set of six tackles. : : If a team scores a try, they have an opportunity to \\"convert\\" it for two further points by kicking the ball between the posts and above the crossbar - that is, through the goal. The kick is taken at any point on the field of play in line with the point that the ball was grounded for the try parallel to the touch-lines. So it is advantageous to score a try nearer to the posts as it is easier to convert it. : The kick can be either a drop kick or a place kick. : The attempt to tackle an attacker who has breached the main line of defenders. : Another name for the crash ball. : A dangerous tackle in which a grounded player's chin is forced down towards his torso.NRL to launch dangerous-tackle crackdown targeting 'crusher' and 'cannonball' tackles : Sometimes referred to as a \\"cut out ball\\", \\"face ball\\", or \\"face pass\\", the ball is passed by an attacking player across the front of one of their team mates and caught by a team mate positioned further away. This pass may be used to move the ball more speedily away from defenders who are closing in and likely to be focussing on the player who is \\"cut out\\". D : The ball is deemed to be dead if it goes out of play beyond the dead ball line. : A boundary located at each end of the playing field. The dead ball line is out of play. : A penalty that may not be kicked for goal by the team to which it is awarded. This kind of penalty is awarded when technical rule breaches (i.e. not foul play or obscene language) are committed during the time a scrum exists.RLIF, 2004: 33 A differential penalty can be award against any player, whether in the scrum or outside. : A referee may call \\"Dominant!\\" as a player is tackled to indicate the dominance of the defender over the attacking player in possession during the contact between them at the tackle. A dominant tackle is judged to be when the defender makes contact and drives the attacker back in one movement. The dominant tackle call rewards good technique and allows the defender extra time before the attacker must be released to be allowed to play-the-ball. : A hand- off that results in the defender getting floored and the attacker continuing their run. : An illegal movement in the attempt to score a try. An attacking player whose momentum does not allow the ball to reach the try-line or in-goal after their ball-carrying arm touches the ground may not reach out to score if a defender is in contact with them; this is disallowed by interpretation as a \\"double movement\\". : Downward pressure is one of the several criteria that needs to be met for a try to be awarded by the referee. : An offensive ruse, where the ball carrier moves as if to pass the ball to a team-mate, but then continues to run with the ball himself; the objective is to trick defenders into marking the would-be pass receiver, creating a gap for the ball carrier to run into.RLIF, 2004: 40 : Another offensive tactic; a player on the attacking team runs towards the opposition as if running onto a pass, only for the ball to be passed to another player, carried on by the ball carrier or kicked forwards. As with a dummy pass, this tactic draws defenders away from the ball and creates space for the attacking team. Also called a \\"decoy runner\\". E F : See: Cut out pass : A defending player in contact with the ball-carrier during or after the completion of a tackle aggressively and illegally touching the face of the ball-carrier with their hand or forearm. There may be different motivations for this action, such as wanting to provoke a reaction from the ball-carrier in order to gain a penalty, attempting to establish dominance over their opponent, or as a symptom of frustration. An instance of the ball coming into contact with a person's head, almost always unintentionally. : See: Loose head and feed : To roll the ball into the scrum.RLIF, 2004: 7 : Technically, the ball should enter the scrum via the tunnel formed by the front row forwards of the two teams binding together, with both teams able to strike for the ball, but a relaxed application of the rule is practised. The relaxed application allows players to roll the ball more directly into their team's side of the scrum thus reducing the chances of the other team successfully striking for the ball and gaining possession of it. : \\"Feeding!\\" is an ironic accusation sometimes called out by spectators of a game in response to a player taking advantage of the modern application of the rule. : Fending is the action by the ball carrier of repelling a tackler using his arm, also known as a \\"hand off\\". For the action to be legal, the ball carrier's arm must be straight before contact is made; a shove or \\"straight-arm smash\\", where the arm is extended immediately before contact or on contact, is illegal and classed as dangerous play. : The first man to receive the ball off the ruck, i.e. from the dummy-half. : See: Stand-off. : A style of attacking play characterised by a lack of depth along the line of attacking players. More of the attacking team are in close proximity to defenders. The attackers look to take advantage of weaknesses created if defenders cannot organise themselves and allocate defenders to where they are needed. Weaknesses of this style of play include risk of passes being intercepted and a lack of speed in the attacking line. : This type of pass involves the player in possession of the ball and a team mate being level when the pass is received. The player about to receive the ball may be running past the ball-carrier aiming for a gap in the defence; with this there is a risk of committing a forward pass if the players get their timing wrong. : An attempt by a player not involved in the completion of a tackle to delay the player in possession from getting to their feet quickly afterwards by falling on top of those involved. The referee can award a penalty to the attacking team when he sees this tactic. : A non-technical breach of the rules such as a high tackle. : The four-tackle rule was in force between 1966 and 1972. The rule ended the situation, a by-product from the introduction of the play-the-ball in 1906, whereby teams could have a potentially unlimited number of tackles.Bottom ten: Rugby league rules, Rugby League World, Aug 2009: 62 The tackle limit was raised from four to six tackles in 1972 to alleviate \\"disjointed\\" play. : The title of full back (numbered 1) comes from the full back's defensive position where the player drops out of the defensive line to cover the rear from kicks and runners breaking the line. They therefore usually are good ball catchers and clinical tacklers. In attack the full back will typically make runs into the attack or support a runner in anticipation of a pass out of the tackle. G : See Advantage line : \\"Ger 'em onside\\", or \\"gerrumonside\\", is a corruption of \\"get them onside\\" shouted to match officials in some northern England accents. The term is used predominantly to express dissatisfaction with the distance back from the play-the-ball that the referee has taken the defending players. : In competitions under some authorities, the referee will call \\"Go\\" to tell the defensive line that they may advance after an attacker has played the ball. This call is intended to reduce stoppages to deal with offside offences by defenders. This call may be used by the referee as part of a sequence: \\"Move, hold, go\\". : Two solid, straight white lines (one at each end) stretching across the entire width of the pitch passing directly through the goal posts which defines the boundary between the field of play and the in-goal. As the goal line is defined as part of the in-goal, attacking players can score tries by placing the ball with downward pressure onto the goal line itself. The base of the goal posts and post protectors are also defined to be part of the goal line. : The goal line is often referred to as the \\"try line\\" though that term does not appear in the Laws of the Game. : Awarded when a defending player grounds the ball in his own in-goal area, is tackled with the ball in his own in-goal area, or when a defending player plays the ball dead (or into touch) behind his own goal line. The defending team must kick the ball from their own goal line and beneath the uprights to a minimum distance of ten metres. : Change in running style from a sprint to high kicking in order to slow down a defender only to sprint once defender has slowed down. : See: 1895 Schism : The act of placing the ball down correctly over the try line in order to score a try. The question of whether a try was properly grounded is often key to the referee's decision to award a try or not. H : The haka is a traditional MƒÅori dance performed by the Kiwis, the international rugby league team of New Zealand, immediately prior to international matches. It serves as a challenge to the opposing team. The term is often used more broadly (and often inaccurately) to refer to any war dance performed prior to a match (such as Samoa's Siva Tau). : See Scrum-half. : See Halves. : A situation in which a ball-carrier is able to briefly get through the defensive line but is tackled before they can make a clean break. : The halves, also known as half backs and sometimes inside backs, are the scrum- half (or halfback) and stand-off (or five-eighth) positions. They are named thus as in 19th century rugby football they were positioned at the midpoint between the forwards and the three full backs used during that time. Originally known as halfway backs in the 19th century, this was shortened in time. : See Fend. : \\"The surrendering of the ball to the opposition after a team has been tackled the statutory number of successive times.\\" After the sixth tackle is completed the handover occurs.RLIF, 2004: 25 If the team in possession accidentally knocks on or passes forward after the fifth tackle a handover will occur rather than the usual scrum for these breaches; a handover also happens if a team kicks the ball into touch on the full after the fifth tackle. : Before 1983, at the end of a set of tackles, a scrum had been formed with loose head and feed to the team that had been defending. : Short for loose head and feed. : The referee will call \\"held\\" to declare a tackle completed if the ball-carrier is held stationary by defenders. : See Up and under : See Up and under : Another term for high tackle. : A high tackle (or head-high tackle) is a form of tackle where the tackler grasps the ball carrier above the line of the shoulders (most commonly around the neck or at the line of the chin and jaw). : Executed violently or at speed, a high tackle is potentially instantly lethal and, as extremely dangerous play, high tackles are a cause for penalties, and yellow or red cards. : Australasian term for crash ball. : In competitions under some authorities, the referee will tell the defensive line that it is too soon to advance on attackers at the play- the-ball by calling \\"Hold!\\". This call may be used by the referee as part of a sequence: \\"Move, hold, go\\". : The hooker (numbered 9) is most likely to play the role of dummy-half. In defence the hooker usually defends in the middle of the line against the opposition's props and second-rowers. The hooker will be responsible for organising the defence in the middle of the field. In attack as dummy-half this player is responsible for starting the play from every play-the-ball by either passing the ball to the right player, or, at opportune moments, running from dummy-half. It is vital that the hooker can pass very well. Traditionally, hookers 'hooked' the ball in the scrum. Hookers also make probably more tackles than any other player on the field. The hooker is always involved in the play and needs to be very fit. He needs to have a very good knowledge of the game and the players around him. I : A running arc made by an attacking player. Often attempted by fast attacking players once the main line of defending players has been breached when they are left with the last player to beat. The ball-carrier arcs their run further in field, attempting to create indecision in the defender, before turning towards the corner and attempting to reach the goal line first to score a try. : See: Halves : Where a pass, in an attempt to find a member of the same team, is caught by a member of the opposing team. : Each team may make a maximum of 12 interchanges from the 13 starting players and four substitutes. A player sent from the field by the referee because they are bleeding may be replaced but should this happen the replacement will count as one of that team's allotted interchanges. Props are the most commonly interchanged players due to their frequent physical confrontations with opponents. The number of interchanges allowed may differ in local competitions. K : See: Punt-out : A coin is tossed and the winning captain either chooses which direction his team shall play, or elects to take the kick that starts the game. Both halves of the match are started with a kick off a tee from the centre-point of the halfway line. The kick must cross the opposition's 10-metre line, unless played by a member of the receiving team. The opposition are not allowed to encroach beyond the 10-metre line until the ball is kicked. : If the ball does not travel 10 metres, goes straight into touch, or goes over the dead ball line at the end of the pitch, the opposing will be given a penalty at the centre. : After a score, the game is restarted from the same place under the same restrictions, with the conceding team drop-kicking the ball to the scoring team. : It is also called a knock-forward. A knock-on is committed when, in an attempt to play at the ball, a player knocks the ball towards their opponents' dead ball line with their hands or arms and it touches either the ground, or an opposing player. However, the ball may be knocked back. A knock-on results in a scrum with the put-in to the opposition apart from when a knock-on is committed by a player whose team is on their last tackle, when the result is a handover, and apart from if the opposing team gains possession of the ball, which results begins their set of tackles with a zero tackle. L : A late tackle is a tackle executed on a player who has already passed or kicked away the ball. As it is illegal to tackle a player who does not have the ball, Late tackles are penalty offences (referees allow a short margin of error where the tackler was already committed to the tackle) and if severe or reckless may result in yellow or red cards. : If a late tackle occurs after a kick and a penalty is awarded, the non-offending team has the option of taking the penalty where the ball landed. : When Team A's forward pack are on top of team B's pack and help 'lay a platform' for the backs. : A phenomenon in Australian rugby league, in which hospitality and gaming venues are operated for the benefit of a rugby league club and its community. The football club controls the leagues club through the appointment of board members. In the past, leagues' respective clubs have provided funds to finance the operation of the sporting club, often due to profits made from poker machines. In the 2000s political attacks over corporate governance have led to tax changes that have lessened profitability and meant clubs needed to look at widening their revenue streams. : Limited tackles were introduced in 1966, initially with a four-tackle rule.Top ten: Rugby league rules, Rugby League World, Aug 2009: 61 After using their tackles, the team in possession must surrender the ball to their opponents. The limit would remain four until an increase to six tackles in 1972 created the six-tackle rule. : The speed of the defensive team in rushing forwards to meet the ball carrier from the tackle. Since the defensive side must retreat 10 metres after each tackle, a key aspect of defence is how much of this 10 metres they can recover before contact with the ball carrier. : A referee may decide that an attacking player did not sufficiently protect their possession of the ball as they came into contact with defenders; this is termed a loose carry. This interpretation allows a referee to decide if they think the attacking player committed a knock-on or whether the defenders stripped the ball with intent. : The loose forward (numbered 13) is the only forward in the third (last) row of the scrum. They are usually one of the fittest players on the field, covering the entire field on both attacking and defending duties. Typically they are big ball-runners who can occasionally slot in as a passing link or kick option; it is not uncommon for loose forwards to have the skills of a five eighth and to play a similar role in the team. : A team awarded a scrum due to a mistake by the opposing team is given the loose head and feed of that scrum. The \\"loose head\\" means that the prop closest to the player who feeds the scrum (puts the ball in) will be a team mate. : In the era of fully contested scrums the loose head prop was able to exert influence on the outcome of the scrum by protecting the ball, moving the scrum etc. : Before 1983, a scrum was formed at the end of a set of tackles, but in 1983 this was changed to a handover of possession. M : The mark is the place on the field where the referee awards a penalty kick, free kick or scrum. : The defending team may position up to two of their players, known as \\"marker(s)\\" at the play-the-ball opposite the tackled player and the dummy- half from the attacking team. : The attacking player when in the ruck will fall to the floor when touched by the defender looking to earn a penalty. If the referee is not conned he may shout \\"Milking!\\" to tell the attacker 'get on with it'. : The so-called \\"momentum rule\\" is related to the Law on forward passes. Whether a ball has been illegally passed forward is judged by its movement relative to the player passing it. This method of judgement is used because most passes involve the ball moving forwards relative to the ground as the players carrying it are moving towards their opponents' goal line. : The mulligrubber kick is a style of kicking. A mulligrubber is directed towards the ground and forced to bounce. Often used in situations where either the ball needs to be placed in a specific position (i.e. on the try line) or to intentionally stop the opponent from being able to catch the ball on the full. O : Impeding any opponent who does not have the ball by tackling them or obstructing them.RLIF, 2004: 6RLIF, 2004: 23 The referee will penalise a player obstructing an opponent. A player is not required to move out of the path of another to prevent an obstruction. If two players from opposing teams are running in the same direction towards a loose ball they are permitted to shoulder charge their opponent.RLIF, 2004: 11 : An offload is when a player holding the ball is tackled, but passes the ball to a team mate before the tackle is completed. (A tackle is not considered complete until one of the following occurs: the arm carrying the ball touches the ground while the player is still held by the tackler; the player's forward momentum stops - in other words, he stops moving forward - while still being held by the tackler; or the referee calls \\"held\\".) If a player passes the ball legally during a tackle - in other words, if he offloads the ball - it does not count as a tackle in his team's current set of six, and play continues normally. Dual rugby/league international Sonny Bill Williams is particularly famous for his offloading ability. : When the dummy half passes to the first receiver who will take the ball into collision to gain metres. No passing beyond the initial play of the ball and pass from dummy-half occurs. : A player is onside whenever he or she is behind the relevant offside line for the particular phase of play. Players who are onside take an active part in playing the game. : Previously offside players may be \\"put onside\\" by the actions of other players (for example, in a kick ahead in open play, players in the kicker's team in front of the kick are offside but can be put onside by the kicker or any other team member who was onside at the time of the kick running up the pitch past them). So that players can be confident they are now onside and can take an active part in the game, the referee may shout \\"Onside\\" or \\"All onside\\". : If the ball is kicked into touch without first bouncing inside the field of play it is referred to as the ball being kicked into touch on the full. : A player catching the ball after a kick before it bounces has caught it on the full. : The broad side of the pitch in relation to a scrum or a play-the-ball. : The optional kick is the instrument used to bring the ball back into play.RLIF, 2004: 18 The team taking the kick may kick the ball in any way and in any direction. Except in cases of a penalty kick being taken, an optional kick is taken from the centre of the 20m line if the attacking team are the last to touch the ball before it goes over the dead ball line or touch in-goal line. An optional kick will also be awarded if an \\"attacking player infringes in the in-goal area\\" or if a defending player catches a kick in general play on the full while in their in-goal. : See: Threequarters P : Refers to the group of forwards of a team. : To form a scrum. : A set-piece move with numerous variations in which attacking players stand side-by-side facing their own goal line while they and their teammates attempt to obscure the ball and confuse the defenders of the opposing team. The move is named after the Parramatta Eels. : A pass is to transfer a ball to a teammate by throwing it. Passes must not travel forward in direction from the hands of the person passing. There are different varieties of pass, including the flat, direct spin pass; the short, close-quarters pop pass; and the floated pass - a long pass which an advancing player can run onto at pace. : : If a side commits a penalty infringement the opposition can take the option of a place kick at goal from where the infringement occurred. This is called a penalty kick. If successful, it is worth two points. : Placers are used to hold the ball in-place for a kicker during a place kick attempt. Placers are usually only used in the modern game if weather conditions are causing the ball to move from the position it has been set in by the kicker. In the early years of the game, when defenders could charge the ball as soon as it touched the ground, a placer was permitted to be used to place the ball on the ground at the last moment. : The props (numbered 8 and 10) are normally the largest players on field (they typically weigh over 15 stones (100kg) in the open age/senior game). They are positioned in the centre of the line. The prop is an 'enforcer', dissuading the opposition from attacking the centre of the defensive line and in attack give the team momentum by taking the ball up to the defence aggressively. : Between 1897 and 1902, the punt-out, also called a kick-in, was an option for the method of restarting play after the ball had gone into touch (the other option being a scrum).Fagan, 2007: 351 It replaced the line-out in 1897 and was itself replaced by a scrum on the 10 yard line in 1902. A punt-out was taken from the touch-line by a player who could kick the ball back into play, in any direction. : See Feeding the scrum R : The area between each goal line and their respective 20 metre lines, i.e. their own quarter, may be referred to as the \\"red zone\\". : The decision over awarding a possible try having been referred to the video referee for examination may be passed back to the referee on the pitch to make the decision if the video is inconclusive. This rule is not used in the Northern Hemisphere. : Someone who has great knowledge about the sport of Rugby League. : The ruck is located between the player playing-the-ball and the defending marker. The ruck exists during the time between a tackle being completed and the subsequent play-the-ball being completed. The ball cannot be interfered with by the marker whilst it is in the ruck, otherwise a penalty will be issued against that player's team. A penalty is also issued against the attacking team if the player responsible for playing-the-ball, does not play it correctly. S : The state of the defence following a break, with players retreating in order to try to make a cover tackle or to get back onside if the attacker has already been tackled. : A move involving a decoy runner. : Second-year syndrome, also called second-season syndrome, is where young players who, having had a successful d√©but season, struggle in their second season. A commonly cited cause is a failure to develop playing ability further in an era of video analysis by rival teams. : An attempt to cause a disruption and breach in the defence of the opposing team. The attacking player carrying the ball forward will veer at an angle to their left or right, often drawing with them the defender covering them and sometimes engaging another defender by running towards them. A team mate of the ball carrier will run across and forward in the other direction just behind the ball carrier, receiving a pass as they cross and then running on towards the point of the disruption in the defence. : : The scrum half or 'half back' (numbered 7) is the player who directs the game and is usually one of the smaller players on the pitch. The scrum half, along with the stand off, together form the \\"creative unit\\" of the team. They will control the attack, deciding with their passes how the team attacks and if, when and where the ball is kicked. This player is also responsible for making sure all the other players are in the right position for an attacking move. : An attempt by a defending player who has made a tackle on an attacker to delay the play-the-ball by interfering with the tackled player's attempt to regain their feet. The referee will penalise the attempt if seen. : The second row forwards (numbered 11 and 12) The modern day second row is very similar to a centre and is expected to be faster, more mobile and have more skills than the prop and will play amongst the three- quarters, providing strength in attack and defence when the ball is passed out to the wings. Good second-rowers combine the skills and responsibilities of props and centres in the course of the game. : A phrase sometimes used in commentary to refer to a hand-off or fend. : Refers to the positioning of players. Most often used when talking about the positioning of attacking players when they are supporting the ball-carrier after a break. \\"Good shape\\" will usually mean the support players have succeeded in positioning themselves to either side of the player running with the ball to offer offensive passing options. : The side of the play-the-ball which has the shorter distance to the touch line. : A term used to praise a big hit on an opposing player. \\"Shot\\" can be heard by commentators when they witness a big, dominant tackle. It's a seal of approval. : The show: the player in possession of the ball will attack the defensive line with a stance and holding the ball in front of them in a way so as to create the impression that a pass to a team mate is likely to occur. The defenders may be unwilling to commit themselves to tackling the ball-carrier as to do so would could create an exploitable gap in the line should a pass be made. : The go: with indecision created in the defence, the ball carrier will sprint for a weak point in the defensive line. : An attempt to evade defenders by the attacking player carrying the ball. By stepping to the side, the attacking player is testing the reactions of defenders and hoping gain time and space to advance the ball. : The six-tackle rule was introduced in 1972, modifying the rules on limited tackles, to alleviate the \\"disjointed\\" play experienced with the four-tackle rule. : The sliding defence requires that gaps are left at either edge of the field at the end of the defensive line, which aims to squeeze more players around the area of play. This allows the line to be at its strongest around the position of play, thus leaving the attacking side less opportunity to run through the line. Should the attacking side move the ball towards one edge of the field in an attempt to go around the defensive line, then the entire defensive line will move in that direction; this is known as sliding. : The stand off, or \\"five-eighth\\", (numbered 6) is one of the most skilful players in a team, often a playmaker and likely to be a tactical kicker for the team. The stand-off will have a high level of interaction with the other playmaker positions (scrum-half, loose forward and hooker), and will usually be involved in most passing moves. : The act of defending players removing the ball from the possession of the attacking player. This is allowed if there is only one defender in contact with the attacker (see one-on-one tackle). : As well as the 13 players on the playing field, each team selects up to four substitutes to be available as replacements in interchanges during the game.RLIF, 2004: 9 : \\"Summer era\\" and \\"Super League era\\" are virtually synonymous terms in British rugby league for the period of time since the 1996 change to the top level of competition in the United Kingdom from being the Rugby Football League Championship, which was played to a schedule that included the winter months of November, December and January, to being Super League and played in the summer months. : Rugby league in the northern hemisphere, led by Britain, has gravitated increasingly towards playing in the summer rather than in the traditional winter seasons. The initial change was made by the top level of competition in the United Kingdom when Super League I launched in 1996 and played through the summer. Since then the other professional tiers, as well as amateur competitions such as the Rugby League Conference, and some junior leagues have changed or been formed to play in summer. Benefits have included fewer postponed matches and a more enjoyable experience for players and spectators. : Players in support are putting themselves in a position to be able to assist a team mate. Effective support play is considered vital to quickly take advantage of opportunities to make ground towards the opponents' end of the field or to score. : A referee may call \\"Surrender!\\" as a player is tackled to indicate that they have judged the player in possession to have allowed themselves to be tackled by diving to the ground or by collapsing in the tackle. The referee will allow the defending team more time to release the tackled player. The intention of the player in possession is to gain an unfair advantage by having a speedy play- the-ball and resumption of play so that their team can press their advantage by reducing the amount of time available for the defending team to organise their defence. The player in possession aims to allowing the tackle to be completed on their own terms, for example their body position, letting them more easily regain their feet. : Defending players may be penalised by the referee if they are caught using a swinging arm against the ball-carrier in the tackle. T : Another term for Ankle tap. : The threequarters, also known as \\"outside backs\\", consist of the wingers and centres. The term \\"threequarters\\" originated as the tactics and player formations of rugby football developed in the 1880s. The players positioned between the halves and the full back were known as the quarters; during the years in which it was usual for there to be three players positioned here, they were known collectively as the three quarters. Later, the addition of a fourth player to the quarters became usual for teams. As the formations developed, an additional player was placed between the halfback and the quarters. Due to a semantic change for three quarters to mean 6/8ths, with halfback being 4/8ths, the position came to be known as the five-eighth. : The part of the touch line that is inside the in-goal area. If a team causes the ball to go into touch in-goal in their own in-goal area they must perform a goal line drop-out. If a team causes the ball to go into touch in-goal in the opposing team's in-goal, the opposing team will be given an optional kick on the 20 metre line. : Otherwise known as the goal line, so-called because a player has to cross this line to score a try. : Another term for handover. U : The umbrella defence (or \\"up and in defence\\") requires that players do not spread across the entire field. The defensive line is particularly vulnerable on the edges around the wings, therefore the best defensive measure in this case is a preventive measure. That is, the aim becomes to prevent the attacking team from going to the wings or to disrupt any passes towards the edge of the field. This requires that defensive players (wingers or centres) on the edge of the defensive line move up faster than those in the middle of the line. : See: Umbrella defence : A style of play intended to reduce the chance of attacking players committing errors. This is usually accomplished by limiting passes in number and risk. Often advocated for use by a team in the lead late in the match. V : The attacking player in possession is not allowed to \\"deliberately and unnecessarily\\" allow themselves to be tackled by falling to the ground when not held by a defender.RLIF, 2004: 24 This includes times when a player has fallen on a loose ball, in these instances the player must attempt to regain their feet and continue. Section 11, Law 4 of the Laws of the Game deems the voluntary tackle illegal. W : The wings or \\"wing three quarters\\" (numbered 2 and 5) are normally the fastest players in a team and play on the far left and right fringes of the field (the wings). Their main task is to receive passes and score tries. The wingers also drop back on the last tackle to cover the left and right sides of the field for kicks while the full back covers the middle. Z : Zam-Buk, or zambuk, was a skin-dressing sold in chemists and used by ambulance-men and first aiders at rugby league matches on injured players from the 1900s. In Australia and New Zealand the term was soon being used to refer to the ambulance-men and first aiders themselves. The term fell into disuse in the 1970s as ambulance-men and first aiders were replaced by club trainers and others.

Early life Charles was the son of Charles Burney, Paymaster Chief Royal Navy, and his wife Eleanor Norton, daughter of the Rev. W. A. Norton, rector of Alderton and Eye, Suffolk. He was educated at Merchant Taylors' School, and St John's College, Oxford. Career 11th century Hebrew Bible with Targum. In 1893 Burney was elected Senior Scholar of St John's and lecturer in Hebrew. He became a Fellow of St John's in 1899 and Vice President in 1900, 1906, 1910 and 1911. In June 1914, Dr Burney became the Oriel Professor of the Interpretation of Holy Scripture, and was additionally elected a Fellow of Oriel College, Oxford in 1919. Burney published several works on biblical history. In Israel's settlement in Canaan, he brought much new or newly applied material, especially from Babylonian sources, to explain Israel's early residence in Canaan. A major contribution was the theory that Yahweh (Jehovah) was at an early period an Amorite deity. In The Aramaic Origin of the Fourth Gospel he attempted to prove that St John's Gospel was a literal Greek translation of a Gospel written in Aramaic by a Jewish disciple, and this at least led to an accepted view that the author thought in Aramaic, and strengthened the probability that it was the work of an eyewitness. Family In 1913 at the age of 45 he married Ethel Wordsworth Madan (1891‚Äì1984), the elder daughter of Falconer Madan and his wife Frances Hayter. In 1929 Ethel Burney started work for Rosalind Moss at the Griffith Institute at Oxford. Together Moss and Burney continued the work that had been started by Bertha Porter (with Moss as her assistant) in the early 1920s on the Topographical Bibliography of Ancient Egyptian Hieroglyphic Texts, Reliefs, and Paintings. 'The Two Ladies' as they were known travelled throughout the Middle East and the rest of the world until the late 1960s visiting digs, museums and collections, and gathering data for the many volumes of the Topographical Bibliography that they produced together with a small team of collaborators.

Goldhaber was a world expert on the interactions of K+ mesons with nucleons and made numerous discoveries relating to it. Biography Goldhaber was born November 4, 1923 in Vienna, Austria. Goldhaber grew up in Palestine after her family emigrated out of Austria. She attended Hebrew University of Jerusalem where she met her future husband, Gerson Goldhaber. Goldhaber graduated with an M.Sc in 1947, and was married to Gerson the same year. The Goldhabers moved to the United States to pursue doctorates at University of Wisconsin‚ÄìMadison which they were awarded in 1951. The couple with their son Amos Nathaniel moved to Columbia University in New York City, where Gerson worked in the Physics Department, and Sulamith, despite her degree in physical chemistry, found work as an assistant to Prof. Jack Steinberger, working on what were then considered high energy experiments at the Nevis Laboratory of Columbia. Goldhaber became a naturalized citizen of the United States in 1953. The Goldhabers moved to Berkeley, California in 1953 when Gerson was given a job as an assistant professor at the University of California. While Goldhaber had previously worked in physical chemistry, she was able to transition to high energy physics and form a collaboration with her husband working on nuclear emulsion. The Goldhabers hoped to use their nuclear emulsion technique with the newly opened Bevatron ‚Äî at the time the highest energy accelerator in operation ‚Äî and it was through their methods that they observed some of the earliest interactions between K‚àí mesons and protons. Using the Bevatron and the nuclear emulsion technique Goldhaber was the first to observe mass splitting in charged E hyperons as well as the first nuclear interactions of the antiproton. In the 1960s the Goldhabers realized that they should begin using the bubble chamber to continue their studies instead of nuclear emulsion so they formed the \\"Goldhaber-Trilling Group\\" with George Trilling. Goldhaber quickly became a renowned expert in hydrogen bubble chamber physics, accruing a lengthy list of invited papers and conference talks. The Goldhabers were the first to measure the spin of the K* meson and the first to study the simultaneous production of pairs of resonant states. They also invented the triangle diagram to aid in their research. Early in this period, the Goldhabers were both Ford Foundation fellows at CERN where they co-authored a CERN reportSeparation of high-energy particles by means of strong interaction processes, CERN-61-03 together with B. Peters. Goldhaber was in high demand as a speaker at scientific conferences due to her mastery of her field, and her ability to express herself beautifully. Goldhaber gave a seminal talk at the 1965 Rochester Conference that marked the transition from cosmic ray based experiments to particle accelerator base experiments in the study of strange particles. In the fall of 1965 the Goldhabers took a sabbatical to travel around the world visiting high energy laboratories and giving lectures. They first stopped at Oxford for the biennial European conference on high energy physics, and then CERN so that Goldhaber could discuss methods of making automatic film measurements with Berkeley's Hough- Powell device. The Goldhabers then traveled to Ankara to lecture, and spent a month at the Weizmann Institute in preparation for the lectures Sulamith was to give in Madras, India. In Madras Goldhaber suffered a stroke. Exploratory surgery revealed a growing brain tumor. She died without having regained consciousness on December 11, 1965. Goldhaber had one son with her husband named Amos. She was remembered by her friends and colleagues as \\"a distinguished scientist, a remarkable homemaker and hostess, and a devoted wife and mother\\".

Constantine played a pivotal role in placing his son on the throne by engineering the murder of Philip, the husband of Isabella, Queen of Armenia. He tricked Philip‚Äôs father, Bohemond IV of Antioch, to search for his son at Amouda rather than at Sis, where he was being tortured and poisoned.

The Wodeyar dynasty, as the ruling family is known, ruled the southern Karnataka region until Indian independence in 1947, when the kingdom was merged with the Union of India. Administration Records pertaining to the administration of the Mysore territory during the overlordship of the Vijayanagara Empire (1399 to 1565) are not available. After the decline of the Vijayanagara Empire, King Raja Wodeyar gradually gained independence, eventually ousting the governor at Srirangapatna. The regional head of the diminished Empire now ruled from their new capital at Chandragiri (in modern Andhra Pradesh).Kamath (2001), p228 During the rule of Narasaraja Wodeyar, the first gold coins were issued from Mysore. The position of the fledgling Mysore kingdom improved considerably during the rule of King Chikka Devaraja Wodeyar, who increased the value of the Treasury to 90,000,000 pagoda (a unit of currency). For his achievements, the king earned the title Navakotinarayana (literally nine-crore Narayana). Chikka Devaraja Wodeyar founded the Attara Kacheri, the central secretariat consisting of eighteen departments.Kamath (2001), pp-228‚Äì229 When Haider Ali became the Kingdom's de facto ruler in the later half of the eighteenth century, a large booty of gold coins usurped from the coffers of the Nizam of Golconda helped fund Mysore's expansionary policy.Kamath (2001), p231 Haider Ali's military success was due to his fast moving French trained cavalry.Kamath (2001), p233 The Kingdom was divided into 5 provinces (Asofis) of unequal size, comprising 171 Paraganas (taluk) in total. The Sira province comprised 5 Paraganas that contributed 200,000 varaha (a unit of currency) and the Srirangapatna province contained 102 Paraganas and contributed 1,70,0000 varaha. When Tipu Sultan became the de facto ruler, the Kingdom, which encompassed 62,000 mi¬≤ (160,000 km¬≤), was divided into 37 Asofi and a total of 124 taluks (Amil). Each Asofi had a governor, or Asof, and one deputy Asof. The taluk was headed by an Amildar and a Patel was in charge of a group of villages.Kamath (2001), p234 The central administration comprised six departments headed by ministers, each aided by an advisory council of up to four members;Kamath (2001), p235 the military by Mir Miran, the revenue ministry by Mir Asaf, the navy by Mir Yem, the treasury, the commerce and the ordnance by Muluk-ut-Tufar. It has been noted that the policy of replacing Hindu governors with Muslim Asofs may have led to its revenue downfall.Kirmani in Kamath (2001), p237 It is claimed that for a very brief period, the Kannada language was replaced by the Persian language in administration and accounting.N.K. Sinha in Kamath (2001), p237 The army consisted of infantry, cavalry, artillery and the navy. The navy had forty ships operating from Mangalore, Kundapura and Tadadi. Following Tipu's death in 1799, the kingdom came under direct British rule in 1831. Lushington, Briggs and Morrison, the early commissioners, were followed by Mark Cubbon and Lewin Bentham Bowring.Kamath (2001), p251 Mark Cubbon took charge in 1834 and is known for his excellent handling of the kingdom. He made Bangalore the capital and divided the princely state into 4 divisions, each under a British superintendent. The state was further divided into 120 taluks with 85 taluk courts, with all lower level administration in the Kannada language. The Amildar was in charge of a taluk to whom a Hoblidar, the caretaker of a Hobli comprising a few villages, reported. The office of the commissioner had eight departments; revenue, post, police, cavalry, public works, medical, the animal husbandry, judiciary and education. The judiciary was hierarchical with the commissioners' court at the apex, followed by the Huzur Adalat, four superintending courts and eight Sadar Munsiff courts at the lowest level. Mark Cubbon is credited with the construction of over one thousand miles of roads, hundreds of dams, coffee production and improvements in the tax and revenue systems.Kamath (2001), p252 Lewin Bowring became the chief commissioner in 1862 and held the position until 1870. Under Lewin Bowring, the state was divided into three divisions, each under a British commissioner. There were eight districts in all under these divisions, with each looked after by a deputy commissioner who was aided by the Amildars and Hoblidars. The property \\"Registration Act\\", the \\"Indian Penal code\\" and \\"Code of Criminal Procedure\\" came into effect and the judiciary was separated from the executive branch of the administration. Lewin Bowring expanded the education system with the formation of the Central Educational Agency, helping the kingdom modernize quickly. However, unlike Mark Cubbon, Lewin Bowring generally preferred to employ British officers.Kamath (2001), p253 In 1881, following a strong lobby favouring rendition, the British handed back the administration of Mysore to King Chamaraja Wodeyar VIII. The post of commissioner was abolished and replaced by a Diwan, his two advisers and a British resident in the Mysore court. C. V. Rungacharlu, a native of Chennai, became the Diwan, while the first ever Representative Assembly of British India, with 144 members consisting of prominent people from various fields was formed in 1881. He identified himself with the Kannada language and patronised it by establishing the Palace drama company. He started favourable economic policies such as public loans and public works as well as building the railway line from Bangalore to Mysore.Kamath (2001), p254 He was followed by K. Seshadri Iyer in 1883. During his time, gold mining at Kolar Gold Fields began and extensive coffee plantations and railway lines were laid. The Assembly elections were held with a three-year tenure for elected members. Taluk boards were formed giving decentralised authority at that level, the Mysore Civil Service Examinations were held for the first time in 1891 and the Department of Geology and the Department of Agriculture were founded in 1894 and 1898. Other notable achievements include the construction of the Vanivilas Sagar dam across Vedavati river, the initiation of the Shivanasamudra hydroelectric project in 1899 (the first such major attempt in India), electricity and drinking water (the latter through pipes) being supplied to Bangalore and the founding of the Archaeological Survey of Mysore (1890) and the Oriental Manuscripts Library.Kamath (2001), p254-255 P. N. Krishnamurti, a descendant of Diwan Purnaiah, took office in 1901. The founding of The Secretariat Manual to maintain records, the introduction of British administrative methods and the founding of the Co-operative Department in 1905 are credited to him. V. P. Madhava Rao, who became the Diwan in 1906, paid attention to conservation of forests. He started the Legislative Council in 1907, the Central Co-operative Bank in Bangalore, aided the Vokkaligara Sangha in 1906 and created the Mysore News Paper Regulation Act of 1908. He was followed by T. Ananda Rao, who inaugurated the Mysore Economic Conference, finalised the Krishna Raja Sagara dam and completed the Mysore Palace in 1910.Kamath (2001), p257 The name Sir M. Visvesvaraya, popularly known as the \\"Maker of Modern Mysore\\" holds pride of place in the history of Karnataka.Kamath (2001), p259 A visionary by any standard and an engineer by education, he wrote the book A Vision of Prosperous Mysore in 1902, stressing the need for technological and educational advancement as a catalyst to industry, commerce and agriculture. He became the Diwan in 1909.Kamath (2001), p257 Membership of the Mysore Legislative Assembly was increased from 18 to 24 with powers to discuss the state budget. The Mysore Economic Conference was expanded into three committees; industry and commerce, education and agriculture, with publications in English and Kannada. Village panchayats, local boards and municipalities were headed by elected members.Kamath (2001), p258 A long list of important projects were commissioned during his time including the construction of the Krishna Raja Sagara dam, the Government Soap Factory and the Mysore Sandal Oil Factory, the founding of the Iron and Steel Works in Bhadravati, and the Mysore Bank in 1913. Visvesvaraya founded the University of Mysore in 1916, the Mysore Chamber of Commerce and Industry, the Visvesvaraya College of Engineering in Bangalore and the Karnataka Sahitya Parishad. He was followed by Sir M. Kantaraj Urs in 1919 and Sir Albion Rajkumar Banerjee in 1922. Sir Mirza Ismail took office as Diwan in 1926 and built on the foundation laid by Visvesvaraya, making substantial progress in modernising the Kingdom of Mysore. Amongst his contributions were the expansion of the Bhadravati Iron works, and founding of a cement and paper factory in Bhadravati. Hindustan Aeronautics Limited, a porcelain factory and a glass factory were founded in Bangalore, a sugar factory at Mysore and the first fertilizer factory in Belgola were established. An able administrator with a penchant for gardens, he founded the Brindavan Gardens (Krishnaraja Sagar), the Mysore Medical College and the Kaveri high level canal to irrigate in modern Mandya district.Kamath (2001), p260 Ismail was followed by Sir N. Madhava Rao and Sir Arcot Ramasamy Mudaliar before the Kingdom was incorporated into the newly independent India in 1947. Notes References * Suryanath U.

Early life Kekewich was the second son of Trehawke Kekewich, of Peamore House, near Exeter, Devon, and the grandson of Samuel Trehawke Kekewich. He was also the brother of Sir Trehawke Herbert Kekewich, 1st Baronet and the nephew of the judge Sir Arthur Kekewich. He was educated at Marlborough. Initial military career Entering the British Army through the militia, Kekewich joined the Buffs on 2 December 1874. He fought in the Perak War of 1875‚Äì6, and in the Sudan, 1884‚Äì5, where he gained a brevet majority. He was employed as Deputy Assistant Adjutant-General in the Sudan campaign of 1888, and afterwards as military secretary to the Commander-in-Chief, Madras, and was engaged in the Third Anglo-Burmese War. Boer War Kekewich was promoted into the Loyal Regiment (North Lancashire) and commanded the 1st Battalion of that regiment in the Second Boer War. He commanded the garrison in Kimberley during the siege and successful defence of the town, during which time he came into conflict with Cecil Rhodes who was also present. Following the relief of the town on 15 February 1900, Rhodes persuaded John French, commanding the relief force, to replace Kekewich with another officer as commander of the garrison. Kekewich received a brevet promotion to colonel for his services a week later, on 21 February 1900. In late September 1901 he was wounded in an attack by General de la Rey near Moedwil, but soon recuperated. In April 1902 he was in charge during the British victory at the Battle of Rooiwal, the last major battle during the war. He stayed in South Africa until peace had been signed in June 1902, when he returned to England on the SS Carisbrook Castle, landing at Southampton in early August. In a despatch dated 23 June 1902, Lord Kitchener, Commander in Chief in South Africa during the latter part of the war, wrote how Kekewich had \\"maintained his high reputation as a fine soldier of character, loyalty and discretion\\" throughout the war, and concluded that he was \\"well qualified to hold high command.\\" For his services Kekewich was appointed a Companion of the Order of the Bath (CB) in the April 1901 South Africa Honours list (the award was dated to 29 November 1900; he only received the actual decoration from King Edward VII at Buckingham Palace on 24 October 1902), and on 22 August 1902 he was promoted major general for distinguished service in the Field. In early October 1902 he was placed on half-pay. Later service and retirement Kekewich retired from the army in 1904 but was appointed to the honorary position of Colonel of the Buffs on 5 October 1909. Character The historian Thomas Pakenham describes Kekewich as \\"a pleasant ... unassuming man\\" but also a serious, painstaking soldier with strong nerves and diplomatic skills. These traits were needed during the siege of Kimberley when Cecil Rhodes behaved in an emotional and irresponsible manner, undermining Kekewich's leadership and standing with his military superiors. Death On the outbreak of World War I in 1914 General Kekewich was appointed to the 13th (Western) Division, which he commanded until shortly before his death by suicide at the age of 60 on 5 November 1914. 6 November 1914, New York Times In poor health and suffering from depression, Kekewich had been invalided from his command and hospitalized before returning to his home near Exeter.The ‚ÄòTimes‚Äô of 7 November 1914 He was buried in St Martin's Churchyard, Exminster, Devon.

Life and literary work  Sergey Zalygin was born on November 23 (December 6), 1913 in Durasovka village in the Ufa province (now Sukharevka, Meleuzovsky district, Bashkortostan). His father, Pavel Ivanovich Zalygin, came from a peasant family of the Tambov province, studied at the University of Kiev, from where he was expelled and exiled to the Ufa province for revolutionary activity. Zalygin‚Äôs mother, Lyubov Timofeevna Zalygina (Abkin), was a daughter of a bank employee from the town of Krasny Kholm, Tver province. She studied at the Women's Higher Courses in St. Petersburg. Sergei Zalygin‚Äôs childhood passed on the Ural mountains, at the Satka factory. In 1920, the family moved to Barnaul (in Western Siberia), where Sergei graduated from a seven-year school, and, later, the Barnaul Agricultural College. He worked as an agronomist in the Tashtypsky district farm union of Khakassia in 1931, where he witnessed the tragic events of collectivization. In 1933-1939, Zalygin studied at the Omsk State Agrarian Institute at the Department of Irrigation and Reclamation. While a student he was influenced by the works of Russian geographer and meteorologist A. I. Voeykov and V. I. Vernadsky. During World War II, he worked as an engineer-hydrologist at the Salekhard Hydrometeorological Station in the Siberian Military District. After his demobilization, Zalygin returned to the Department of Irrigation and Reclamation at the Omsk Agrarian Institute, where in 1948 he defended his thesis on irrigation systems designing and became department chair. Zalygin began to write while being a school student. While studying at the Omsk State Agrarian Institute, he worked as a reporter for a local newspaper. He began to write prose fiction in the 1940s. His first book was published in 1941 (Short Stories, Omsk). In 1952, he was first published in the Novy Mir monthly (Vtoroye deistvie (The Second Act), 1952, No. 9), for which he later submitted a series of essays Vesnoi nyneshnego goda (This Spring, 1954, No. 8) about the interference of authorities in the life of a peasant. This publication brought fame to Zalygin and drew him close to the magazine‚Äôs editor-in-chief, A. Tvardovsky. From 1970, after the dispersal of the editorial office of Novy Mir and the resignation of Tvardovsky, and until 1986, Zalygin refused to be published in the magazine out of solidarity. In 1955, Zalygin moved to Novosibirsk and was mainly occupied by his literary work, although not abandoning the science. In these years, Zalygin, along with short stories, produced works of larger forms - a satirical novel Svideteli (Witnesses, 1956) and Tropy Altaya (Paths in the Altai,1962), in which he described his impressions of the biological expedition to the Altai mountains. His biographer I. Dedkov wrote that Tropy Altaya were ‚Äúan introduction to the philosophy <...>, on which all the main books of Zalygin were built‚ÄùI. Dedkov. Sergei Zalygin. Stranitsy zhizni I tvorchestva [Glimpses of Life and Work]. Moscow, 1985. P. 138. In 1964, Na Irtyshe (On the Irtysh) was published in Novy Mir. The novel describes the catastrophe of the peasant life at the turn of the 1930s, during the collectivization period. ‚ÄúFor the first time in the Soviet censored press, the truth about collectivization was told, for the first time collectivization was shown not in the canonical Sholokhov interpretation, but as a tragedy of the Russian peasants, and even more - as a national catastrophe‚Äù. Official critics accused Zalygin of distorting the ‚Äúconcrete historical truth‚Äù and of ‚Äúideological and artistic inability‚Äù. The artistic significance of the novel was highly esteemed by the public. The poet A. Naiman described his impressions upon reading On the Irtysh some thirty years after its publishing in such words: ‚ÄúThe day when I read the novel was separated from the events, which I had perceived as a living tragedy from my youth, by more than seventy years. <...> The tragedy did not disappear, did not weaken, it simply moved to the special area reserved for tragedies. I read On the Irtysh as if I were reading Sophocles or Aeschylus‚ÄùOktyabr. 2003, No. 9. P. 133. By the end of the 1960s, Zalygin moved to Moscow and switched exclusively to writing. In 1968-1972, he led a prose workshop at the Literary Institute of A. M. Gorky. In 1969, he became the secretary of the board of the Writers‚Äô Union of the RSFSR, in 1986-1990 he entered the secretariat of the Writers‚Äô Union of the USSR. He signed a letter written by a group of Soviet writers to the editorial of the Pravda newspaper on August 31, 1973, denunciating A. Solzhenitsyn and A. Sakharov; he was also one of the people who condemned the Metropol almanach in 1979. At the same time, Zalygin was never a member of the Communist Party, and, in 1986, became the first non-party affiliated editor-in-chief of a Soviet literary magazine. In 1967, Solyonaya Pad‚Äô (Salt Ravine), a novel about the events of the civil war in Siberia, based on various historical documents, which Zalygin collected for several years working in the archives, was published. In it, the image of a fanatic-communist is opposed by the main character - the peasant leader Meshcheryakov (his prototype was the partisan commander E. M. Mamontov). In 1973, two of Zalygin‚Äôs more experimental works were published: the psychological novel Yuzhno-Amerikanski Variant (The South American Variant) and the science fiction novel Os‚Äôka smeshnoy mal‚Äôchik (Oska, the Funny Boy). In the novel Komissiya (Commission,1975) Zalygin once again describes the period of the civil war in Siberia. The following, most ambitious, novel, Posle buri (After the Storm, 2 vol., 1982-1985), is set in the 1920s. It involves not peasants, but the byvshiye (‚Äúused-to-be‚Äù) - the intellectuals who were exiled or fled from the Soviet authorities to the Siberian hinterland. I. Dedkov described the originality of this novel as ‚Äúnot so much a reproduction of characters <...> but of various individual or group ‚Äúphilosophies‚Äù. This is an attempt to recreate the ‚Äúideological landscape‚Äù of the Soviet Russia of the twenties, an attempt to understand the life of human thought during this period‚ÄùI. Dedkov. Sergei Zalygin. Stranitsy zhizni I tvorchestva [Glimpses of Life and Work]. Moscow, 1985. P. 348. Posle buri became Zalygin‚Äôs last major work based on historical events. In the 1980-1990s, he wrote short stories about modern life. His writings of the 1990s are characterized, generally, by a more free form, they represent a combination of fiction and journalism. Zalygin also wrote literary-critical works. The most significant of these are about A. P. Chekhov (Moi poet (My Poet), 1969) and A. Platonov (Skazki realista i realism skazochnika (Tales of a Realist and Realism of a Storyteller), 1970). In 1986, Zalygin became editor-in-chief of the Novy Mir monthly, which, under him, began to play an important role in Mikhail Gorbachev‚Äôs politics of glasnost‚Äô. In the first issue of Novy Mir of 1987, Platonov‚Äôs The Foundation Pit and D. Granin‚Äôs Bison were published. Doctor Zhivago by Boris Pasternak (prepared and commented by V. Borisov and E. Pasternak), 1984 by George Orwell, The Gulag Archipelago, as well as other works of Alexander Solzhenitsyn were published on the pages of Novy Mir for the first time in the USSR. The Humble Cemetery and Stroybat by Sergei Kaledin, Odlyan, or the Air of Freedom by Leonid Gabyshev, the journalistic pieces on the Chernobyl catastrophe by G. U. Medvedev, Advances and Debts by the economist N. P. Shmelev were also published there. During the years of perestroika, the struggle between Novy Mir and the censorship authorities did not go well for the monthly. Some parts of this struggle are described by A. Solzhenitsyn (A grain between two millstones, part 4, Novy Mir, 2003, No. 11) and Zalygin himself (Notes that do not need a plot, Oktyabr, 2003, No. 9-11). In 1991, the circulation of Novy Mir reached 2,700,000. Over his years of working for Novy Mir, Zalygin gained a reputation of a decisive and principled personA. Solzhenitsyn‚Äôs memoirs in Novy Mir, 2003, No. 11; A. Naiman, op. cit.. At the same time, being the head of a prestigious monthly that stood by its ‚Äúnon-partisan‚Äù position (politically and aesthetically), he could refuse to publish even renowned authors, causing their resentment (such was the case with the famous Russian writer and former Soviet dissident Vladimir Voinovich, who later called Zalygin a ‚Äúconformist‚Äù for it). In 1989-1991 Zalygin was People's Deputy of the USSR and a member of the Presidential Council under M.S. Gorbachev. In 1991, he became academician of the Russian Academy of Sciences (Section of Language and Literature). Zalygin received the USSR State Prize (1968), the Hero of Socialist Labour title, together with the Order of Lenin (1988), Order of Friendship (1993) and others prizes and orders of the USSR and the Russian Federation. In 1991, he received the Cond√© Nast Traveler Environmental Award. Sergei Pavlovich Zalygin died on April 19, 2000. He was buried in Moscow at the Troekurovskoye cemetery.  Environmental activity  Though Zalygin quit hydrological engineering in the 1960s, he never ceased to follow attentively what was going on in the country in the sphere of hydro-amelioration and water management resources policies, and took part in public campaigns against ecologically dangerous hydraulic engineering projects which were being worked out by GOSPLAN (State Planning Committee) until the last years of the USSR. His attitude towards state water management policies changed radically in 1961‚Äì1962, when the politically powerful Soviet hydropower agency Gidroproekt came out with the project of constructing a dam and a hydropower station in West Siberia, on the Lower Ob‚Äô. ‚ÄúI was shocked and stupefied, ‚Äì wrote Zalygin later in his memoirs. ‚Äì Back in my day I had worked in the region as hydroengineer, and I could clearly visualize the enormous devastation which a water reservoir of 132,000 square kilometers would have brought about‚Äù. Zalygin became one of the prominent participants in the campaign against the Lower Ob‚Äô Dam projectGerner, Kristian; Stefan Hedlund (1989). Ideology and Rationality in the Soviet Model: A Legacy for Gorbachev. Routledge. p. 363. . He went to various cities to discuss the matter with specialists ‚Äì engineers, geologists, scientists. A key turning point in the debate came with the news of massive oil discoveries in the Lower Ob‚Äô basin, but even after that the entrenched hydropower lobby would not yield up easily. Zalygin‚Äôs articles elucidating the situation were published in one of the leading Soviet newspapers and drew public attention to the problem, converting the opinion of the administration managers. The fight ended in 1963, when a government decree ruled in favor of oil and gas over hydropower as the main priority in West Siberia. In 1985‚Äì1986 Zalygin became one of the organizers of a public campaign against another ambitious project, the Siberian river reversal, aimed at diverting the flow of the Nothern (Siberian) rivers southwards, toward the arid agricultural areas of Central Asia. The campaign was successful, and Zalygin regarded it as an evidence of new possibilities for democratic interference in the ecological policies of the state, unheard-of in the Soviet years.

Lou Malnati's operates a division of its company called Lou Malnati's Presents Tastes of Chicago, a partnership with Portillo's Restaurants and Eli's Cheesecake, which ships Chicago-style cuisine nationally. History Lou Malnati began working with his father, Rudy, in the 1940s making deep-dish pizza. In the 1950s they co-managed Pizzeria Uno. Lou and his wife Jean opened the first Lou Malnati's Pizzeria on March 17, 1971, in Lincolnwood, Illinois.Boykin, Ames \\"Celebrating Schaumberg: Marking the Village's 50 Years\\", Daily Herald, August 12, 2006. The Lincolnwood restaurant was successful, and the family subsequently opened another restaurant in Elk Grove Village, Illinois. After an initial rocky start, the second restaurant proved profitable and the company continued to grow. As of April 2016, Lou Malnati's owns and operates 45 restaurants in the Chicago metropolitan area. The company participates in the Taste of Chicago and has been active in local charities. It has also been a decades-long sponsor of WGN Radio's programming, and its pizza is offered in multiple station contests as a prize. On July 4, 2011, Lou Malnati's opened their biggest pizzeria in the Gold Coast neighborhood of Chicago. After Lou Malnati died of cancer in 1978, his wife and sons Marc and Rick took over the business. Its main competitors include Pizzeria Uno, Giordano's Pizza and Gino's East. Lou Malnati's began opening restaurants in the Phoenix, Arizona, area, with the first location opening at Uptown Plaza in central Phoenix on May 12, 2016.. As of late 2020, Lou Malnati‚Äôs operates four restaurants in Arizona. On July 15, 2019, Lou Malnati's opened their first restaurant in Schererville, Indiana. This location is a carryout, delivery & catering location only and offers no dine in. This was followed on December 11, 2019, with their first restaurant in Wisconsin in the Milwaukee suburb of Fox Point. Lou Malnati‚Äôs has since opened another location in each state, with a third in each state planned to open in 2021.  Pizza style  Lou Malnati's is a prototypical Chicago style pizza, and its deep dish pizza is generally referred to as a \\"pie.\\" A thin crust of pizza dough is laid in a seasoned deep-dish pizza pan and raised up on the sides. The ingredients are placed on a Chicago style deep-dish pizza in the opposite order of a thin crust pizza. The first ingredient is thick slices of mozzarella cheese that are placed directly on the dough. Then additional ingredients like mushrooms, onions and sausage are spread on top of the cheese. The pizza is then topped with a tomato sauce made with whole chunks of tomatoes. A \\"Lou-Mal\\" pie uses a \\"sausage patty,\\" a single patty of Italian sausage below the layer of tomato chunks or sauce, as opposed to the more traditional crumbled sausage.  Philanthropy  Since 1971 the Malnati family has hosted an annual one-day charity event. Lou and Jean Malnati started the event as a scholarship fund for local athletes to Wake Forest University in the name of Brian Piccolo, and after Lou died of cancer in 1978, Jean carried on the annual tradition in Lou's name and the focus was changed to raising money for cancer research. In 1995, Lou Malnati's opened a restaurant in Chicago's west side neighborhood of Lawndale with the goal being to give all profits back to the community to benefit children's educational and recreational programs. While partnering with the Lawndale Community Church, Lou Malnati's has also created a job- training program for residents of the church's recovery home, Hope House, to get them back in the working world.

In early 1900s, the control system of Ward Leonard was adopted by the U.S. Navy and also used in passenger lifts of large mines. It also provided a solution to a moving sidewalk at the Paris Exposition of 1900, where many others had failed to operate properly. It was applied to railway locomotives used in World War I, and was used in anti-aircraft radars in World War II. Connected to automatic anti-aircraft gun directors, the tracking motion in two dimensions had to be extremely smooth and precise. The MIT Radiation Laboratory selected Ward-Leonard to equip the famous radar SCR-584 in 1942. The Ward Leonard control system was widely used for elevators until thyristor drives became available in the 1980s, because it offered smooth speed control and consistent torque. Many Ward Leonard control systems and variations on them remain in use. Basic concept The key feature of the Ward Leonard control system is the ability to smoothly vary the speed of a DC motor, including reversing it, by controlling the field and hence the output voltage of a DC generator, as well as the field of the motor itself. As the speed of a DC motor is dictated by the supplied voltage, this gives simple speed control. The DC generator could be driven by any means. This 'prime mover' could be an AC motor, or it could be an internal combustion engine (its application to vehicles was patented by H.W. Leonard in 1903\\"Electrically propelled Vehicle\\", H.W. Leonard, US Patent 1121382, originally filed March, 1903). A Ward Leonard drive can be viewed as a high-power amplifier in the multi-kilowatt range, built from rotating electrical machinery. Where the 'prime mover' is electrical, a Ward Leonard drive unit consists of a motor and generator with shafts coupled together. The prime mover, which turns at a constant speed, may be AC or DC powered. The generator is a DC generator, with field windings and armature windings. The input to the amplifier is applied to the field windings, and the higher power output comes from the armature windings. (See Excitation (magnetic)#Amplifier principle for how a generator can act as an amplifier.) The amplifier output is usually connected to a second motor, which moves the load, such as an elevator. With this arrangement, small changes in current applied to the input, and thus the generator field, result in large changes in the output, allowing smooth speed control. A flywheel may be used to reduce voltage fluctuations during sudden load changes. The Ward Leonard system with this modification is known as Ward Leonard Ilgner Control. A more technical description A Ward Leonard Control system with generator and motor connected directly. The speed of a DC motor is controlled by varying the voltage fed to the generator field windings, Vgf, which varies the output voltage of the generator. The varied output voltage will change the voltage of the motor, since they are connected directly through the armature. Consequently, changing the Vgf will control the speed of the motor. The picture on the right shows the Ward Leonard control system, with the Vgf feeding the generator and Vmf feeding the motor. Transfer function The first subscripts 'g' and 'm' each represents generator and motor. The superscripts 'f', 'r',and 'a', correspond to field, rotor, and armature. *W_i = plant state vector *K = gain *t = time constant *J = polar moment of inertia *D = angular viscous friction *G = rotational inductance constant *s = Laplace operator Eq. 1: The generator field equation : V_g^f = R_g^f I_g^f + L_g^f I_g^f Eq. 2: The equation of electrical equilibrium in the armature circuit : -G_g^fa I_g^f W_g^r + (R_g^a + R_m^a) I^a + (L_g^a + L_m^a) I^a + G_m^fa I_m^f W_m^r = 0 Eq. 3: Motor torque equation : -T_L = J_m W_m^r + D_mW_m^r With total impedance, L_g^a + L_m^a, neglected, the transfer function can be obtained by solving eq 3 T_L = 0.

The forester was so engaged with the restaurant that the city council was concerned that he was more of a restaurateur than a forester. As a result, the council gave one of the city's restaurants permission to serve the visitors in the woods.History ‚Äì Tivoli Friheden On July 31, 1904 Hans Rising received permission from the town council to build a pavilion and two months later the Restaurant Terrassen was ready.Terrassen, Tivoli Friheden The pavilion was designed by architect S. F. K√ºhnel, who also designed the residential Mejlborg in Mejlgade. The restaurant became popular in short time. Since 1909 concerts took place in every Sunday. Some contemporary artists like Lauritz Melchior or Gerda Christophersen made shows. In 1927 Hans Rising erected the large hall. It was later turned into a theatre. After the World war I swings and children's slides are installed, the restaurant became a place of meeting for several festivals folk music. In 1949, the park opened mini-golf. In 1950 pedal boats and a large chess game in front of the restaurant were introduced. In 1954, after 50 working years, Hans Rising leave the restaurant and the city council engage the restaurateur Dan Christophersen, who was also compositor and manager of cabaret. There had been many different owners of Tivoli Friheden. In 1958 the municipality √Örhus and the owner signed a partnership.

It is located in the garrison town of Diyatalawa in the central highlands of Sri Lanka. All Sri Lanka Army officers, including army cadets of the General Sir John Kotelawala Defence University, are trained at SLMA. Although not a university, SLMA is affiliated to the General Sir John Kotelawala Defence University to provide its cadets of regular long course a degree in military studies. History When the Ceylon Army was raised in 1949, the need arose to recruit and train officers and soldiers of the newly formed army. The Army Recruit Training Depot (ARTD) was therefore formed in Diyatalawa on 6 February 1950 for the purpose of training recruits. The first batch of 114 recruits passed out from the ARTD on 2 June 1950. The ARTD was later named as the Army Training Centre (ATC). But facilities did not exist to train officers, and therefore Officer Cadets were sent to the Royal Military Academy Sandhurst in the United Kingdom. The first batch of ten Officer Cadets were enlisted to the Army on the 10 of October 1949 and were dispatched to RMA Sandhurst.Another reunion By Hiranthi Fernando Subsequently, Officer Cadets were trained at the Indian Military Academy and the National Defence Academy (India), and to a lesser extent, the Pakistan Military Academy in the 1960s. Due to the cost of training officers overseas, the Ceylon Army initiated officer training at the Army Training Centre in 1968 with the formation of the Officer Cadet School. The first intake of Officer Cadets who were earmarked to be trained at the Army Training Centre, Diyatalawa, were enlisted on 16 April 1968. Since then Officer Cadets were locally trained and commissioned. With the expansion and the growing need to train large numbers of recruits, recruit training was assigned to the respective regiments. In 1988 due to the expansion of the Army and the need for more young officers the ATC was given the responsibility of training only Officer Cadets. With this, the Army Training Centre was re- designated as the Sri Lanka Military Academy with effect from 15 January 1981, and since then it has been totally utilized for training of Officer Cadets. At any one time, five to six hundred Officer Cadets are trained at this institution. In 1999, cadet training have elevated to the standards of bachelor's degree in military studies which will be awarded by the Sabaragamuwa University of Sri Lanka, which was shifted to the General Sir John Kotelawala Defence University in 2011.131 Newly Commissioned Officers Join the Army, Ministry of Defence SLMA started academic programs for mid- career Officers in basic command and staff techniques at the level of Grade III/II appointments, (Officers in the ranks of Lieutenant / Captain / Major), with the establishment the Officers Study Centre (OSC) in 1981 which conducted the Junior Command Course (JCC) and the Junior Staff Course (JSC). In 2012, these programs of the OSC were transferred to the newly established Officer Career Development Centre. Organisation In overall command of the SLMA is the Commandant of the Academy, usually an officer of Brigadier rank. SLMA has several Commissioning Courses each year. Each new intake numbers approximately 150 cadets, each of whom joins a company. The commissioning course is split up into three terms, each lasting fourteen weeks, and on each course, cadets are put into one of four companies. There can be as many as several companies within the SLMA at any one time, each commanded by a Major and named after a famous battle in Sri Lankan history. This list is incomplete; you can help by expanding it. *Vijithapura Company *Gannoruwa Company *Randeniwela Company *Balana Company Colours The President's and ATC colours presented to the ATC in 1972, were laid to rest with the change of name to Sri Lanka Military Academy. The Colours were renamed as SLMA Colours and presented by Her Excellency Chandrika Bandaranaike Kumaratunga, the President of the Democratic Socialist Republic of Sri Lanka, on 21 June 1997, at Diyatalawa. Traditions Upon completion of their training, the SLMA hosts the Commissioning ceremony attended by the Commander of the Army, senior army officers, defence attaches of diplomatic establishments and parents. It starts off with the Passing-Out Parade made up of the graduating intakes of cadets, during which the cadets receive the President‚Äôs Commission along with the Sword of Honour and Trophies, awarded to the cadets first in order of merit. This is followed by the Pipping ceremony where parents of new Officers and Lady Officers adorned their uniform and epaulets with the respective insignia. The event is finished with the Commissioning Dinner.New Intakes of Army Officers Receive Their Commission, Sri Lanka Army Training The Sri Lanka Military Academy, Diyatalawa trains Officer Cadets for both Regular and Volunteer Forces of the Sri Lanka Army. It also has undertaken to train an Officer Cadets from the Maldives and Bangladesh since 1992. =Intakes= There are several intakes for cadet officers annually. These are under the following category; *Regular Long Course (Cadet Entry Degree Program) -Two years and nine months - Accredited to the General Sir John Kotelawala Defence University for the Bachelor of Science in Military studies *Short Service Cadets Course - One year *Volunteer cadets intakes - One year (Probationary officers for the Sri Lanka Army Volunteer Force) *Officer cadets from General Sir John Kotelawala Defence University (final year) *Direct Enlisted Course - Three months (Direct Entry Stream to the Regular Force for professionals such as Doctors, IT specialists, Civil Engineers, Accountants etc.) The Commissioning Course lasts two and a half years, during this period, cadets are trained in leadership, tactics, weapons training, military law, military accounting systems and academic studies such as General Science, Management, and General Studies. An intensive course in the English language is conducted during the first six months of training to enhance the English knowledge of Officer Cadets. Completion of research work is a partial fulfillment for the Degree other than the Military and Academic Components. Intakes have been named from 1 and today up to Intake 69 are being trained.

The use of the Internet as prior art in patent law is surrounded by concerns as to its reliability. In the context of patent law, using the Internet as a source of prior art when assessing whether an invention is novel and inventive (two conditions for patentability), may be problematic if it is difficult to ascertain precisely when information on websites became available to the public.T 1134/06, Reasons 3.2: \\"It is thus at the present state of affairs often very difficult to establish with a high degree of reliability what exactly appeared on a web site and when.\\"(emphasis added)  Background  In most patent laws, an (alleged) invention must be new and inventive (or non-obvious, which is basically synonymous of inventive) to be considered patentable, i.e., to be validly patented. An invention is considered new if it does not form part of the prior art (or state of the art), i.e., if it was not already disclosed in the prior art.See for instance, in the European Patent Convention (EPC), . An invention is considered inventive if it is not obvious in view of the prior art.See for instance, in the EPC, . The prior art is essentially everything available to the public before the filing date of the patent. The definition of the prior art, i.e. what is part of the prior art and what is not part of the prior art, however depends on the legislation considered, since patent laws are essentially territorial in nature. In practice, if a device or a method was already known (e.g. described in a scientific paper) before the filing dateor priority date. of the patent covering the device or the method or if the device or method is obvious in view of what was known before the filing date, then, in general, it is not considered new (because known before the filing date) or not considered inventive (because obvious in view of what was known before the filing date of the patent), and then not considered patentable. A patent cannot be obtained for the device or method, or, if obtained (granted), it can generally be \\"invalidated\\". The identification of the prior art is therefore of utmost importance to determine whether an invention is patentable, i.e. whether a patent can be granted for an invention (or whether a patent granted for an invention is valid). The purpose of the novelty criterion is to prevent the prior art being patented again.Case Law of the Boards of Appeal of the European Patent Office (Fifth edition 2006), pages 46-47. (pdf 4.1 MB). The Internet is a popular source of technical information and is of particular interest for the purposes of establishing the prior art. Its use is however surrounded by concerns as to its reliability.T 1134/06, Reasons 3.6.  Jurisdictions  = European Patent Organisation = European Patent Office (EPO) headquarters in Munich, Germany. In August 2009, the European Patent Office (EPO) published a \\"notice concerning internet citations\\"EPO, Notice from the European Patent Office concerning internet citations, Official Journal EPO, 8-9/2009, 456. See also EPO practice on internet citations , Patent Information News issue 3/2009, p. 2. to \\"[set] out the practice followed at the EPO when citing documents retrieved from the internet in both the European and the PCT procedure.\\" The notice is not binding on the Boards of Appeal. Regarding the standard of proof, the notice reads: :\\"When an internet document is cited against an application or patent, the same facts are to be established as for any other piece of evidence, including standard paper publications ... This evaluation is made according to the principle of \\"free evaluation of evidence\\" ... That means that each piece of evidence is given appropriate weight according to its probative value, which is evaluated in view of the particular circumstances of each case. For assessing these circumstances, the balance of probabilities will be used as the standard of proof, as generally applied by the boards of appeal. According to this standard, it is not sufficient that the alleged fact (e.g. the publication date) is merely probable; the examining division must be convinced that it is correct. It does mean, however, that proof beyond reasonable doubt (\\"up to the hilt\\") of the alleged fact is not required.\\"Notice from the European Patent Office concerning internet citations, section 3.2. In 2012, Board of Appeal 3.5.04 issued two decisions, namely T 1553/06 and T 2/09, on the issue of Internet disclosures. The two decisions originate from a contrived test case built by the parties, i.e. the patent proprietor and the opponent. In decision T 1553/06 (page 72), the Board proposed a test to decide whether a document stored on the World Wide Web has been made available to the public, whereas, in decision T2/09, the Board dealt with the alleged public availability of an email transmitted over the Internet. The EPO Guidelines cite the Internet Archive as well as Wikipedia as possible and credible sources of prior art.: \\"Disclosures which have no date or an unreliable date\\" = Germany = In 2002, \\"the Bundespatentgericht in case BPatG 17W (pat) 1/02 (see GRUR 2003 Heft 04, pp 323-325) confirmed in later BPatG 17W (pat) 47/00, ruled that the Internet was not a reliable source for determining the state of the art. This applied also to web archives such as the Internet Archive.\\" T 1134/06, Reasons 3.3.1. =United States= Internet publications can be relied on as printed publications and thus as prior art under United States patent law. The effective date of the publication will be determined by evidence, such a date of posting listed in the publication itself, or a date of archiving in the Internet Archive.MPEP ¬ß 2128 \\"Printed Publications\\" as Prior Art In August 2006, the United States Patent and Trademark Office (USPTO) ordered examiners to stop using Wikipedia as a source of information for determining the patentability of inventions. However, according to The Patent Librarian's Notebook's blog, examiners continue to cite it, and the number of United States patents issued in 2008 that cited Wikipedia articles nearly doubled to 477, compared to 2007. It increased to 809 citations in 2009.

Clarke. It was first published in Super Science Stories (March 1950) and was later collected in Expedition to Earth under the title \\"Nemesis\\". It is also collected in The Collected Stories of Arthur C. Clarke. Plot The first part of the story opens in a near future world, at the climax of a devastating world war, in which ‚ÄúThe Master‚Äù, a Hitler-like figure, has tried and failed to dominate the world by military force. As the enemy closes in on his last stronghold in the Himalayas, the Master seals himself in a suspended animation chamber buried deep in the mountains. He intends to hibernate for one hundred years, after which he assumes that his enemies will have forgotten about him, and then resume his plans for world domination. However, a freak accident disables the mechanism which is supposed to revive him automatically, and the Master remains in suspended animation for billions of years while geological forces reshape the planet above him. The second part of the story skips ahead to the far future when humanity has colonized the stars. Trevindor the Philosopher commits the unprecedented act of challenging the political and philosophical orthodoxy of this peaceful but uniform galaxy-spanning civilization, where dissent, criminality, violence and any form of conflict, are all virtually unknown. Instead of promising to give up his unorthodoxy, Trevindor chooses exile into future time, when the Sun is entering its red giant phase, and Earth is a parched, virtually lifeless desert. Trevindor explores the dying Earth, and has almost resigned himself to spending the rest of his life in isolation, when he finds the Master's hibernaculum, now exposed on the surface by millennia of erosion. In the last part of the story, the two strands come together; Trevindor enters the chamber, and his presence apparently triggers the Master's revival. The Master is shocked to find another person in the chamber with him ‚Äì more so when it becomes apparent that Trevindor can read his mind, and thinks there nothing unusual about telepathy. The Master begins to suspect the truth of what has happened, but Trevindor has also learned the truth about the Master ‚Äì and he must now choose whether to share his exile with a man of almost inhuman barbarism, or to commit an act of inhuman barbarism himself.

But he also drew careful distinctions between what he saw as good Irish and bad Irish, saying in chapter 5 of , > Before I left Liscarrigane, I had never heard from anybody's mouth phrases > such as \\"t√° m√©\\", \\"bh√≠ m√©\\", \\"bh√≠ siad\\"; I always used to hear \\"t√°im\\", > \\"bh√≠os\\", \\"bh√≠odar\\", etc. Little things! ‚Äì but little things that come > repeatedly into conversation.

They initially flew six red Westland Gazelle helicopters, with aircraft and pilots drawn from 705 Naval Air Squadron based at RNAS Culdrose, Cornwall. After a mid-air collision between two aircraft in June 1977, the team size was reduced to four aircraft. History The \\"Sharks\\" were established in 1975 and were unusual in that the team's personnel and crews were changed every year. The pilots were all instructors from 705 NAS, which at the time was the squadron responsible for the basic training of Royal Navy helicopter pilots. Their involvement with the \\"Sharks\\" was purely voluntary, and all the activities involved with the team - the pre-season rehearsals, transits to and from display venues, and the display flying itself - were in addition to their normal weekday duties instructing student pilots on the Westland Gazelle. The \\"Sharks\\" display routine was renowned for mixing together a range of different manoeuvres, comprising close formation, synchronised, opposition and solo flying. The display typically lasted for 10-12 minutes, and was highlighted by the use of distinctive mix of red and green smoke. The team operated successfully for the best part of two decades, appearing at airshows and events around the UK and near Europe. They were regulars at the largest shows such as the International Air Tattoo, Farnborough Airshow, as well as Royal Navy-organised events and the British Grand Prix. Disbandment The team were disbanded in 1992 due to Royal Navy operational and budgetary commitments. Despite this, the Royal Navy Helicopter Display Team title was maintained until the end of 1996 as 705 NAS continued to provide a pair of Gazelles known simply as the \\"Gazelle Pair\\" (although in 1995 a special four- aircraft team was resurrected for a handful of events). With the retirement of the Gazelle from Royal Navy service, the Royal Navy Helicopter Display Team was finally disbanded in 1996. A new display team, composed of two Lynx helicopters, was formed in 2001 and has been known as the Black Cats since 2004.

It was an affluent Victorian and early Edwardian suburb with wide avenues such as Seymour Road, grand villas and Thorn Park. There is solid late Victorian Anglican church named Emmanuel, which has a partnership with Compton Church of England Primary School. A small row of shops lie on Henders Corner (the junction between Mannamead Road and Eggbuckland Road), as well as an NHS GP surgery, The Mannamead Surgery. The suburb gives its name to a local branch of JD Wetherspoon pub, The Mannamead, which is situated on Mutley Plain. The Penguin Lounge, formerly The Tap and Barrel, is a locally owned pub situated on Ashford Crescent. Transport Mannamead Road, which makes up the majority of the B2350, runs from Manadon Roundabout and Hartley to the North, down to Mutley Plain to the South. This the main traffic route for the area, and as a result hosts a frequent bus service Southbound towards the City Centre. Heading Northbound, there are Plymouth Citybus routes towards the suburbs of Crownhill, Eggbuckland, Efford, Southway, Tamerton Foliot, Whitleigh and Woolwell, as well as Derriford Hospital. Stagecoach South West services use Mannamead Road on the way to Tavistock, whilst a Target Travel route between the City Centre and Hartley Vale serves the backroads of Mannamead, such as Compton Avenue, Rockingham Road and Ashford Road. The Lipson Vale Halt railway station was situated just off of Ashford Road, before it was demolished in 1942 due to being a fire hazard during The Blitz.

The Germans knew that many ships of the Soviet Navy had sought refuge in the Kara Sea because of the protection that its ice pack provided during 10 months of the year. History On 16 August 1942, ‚Äîunder Kommodore Wilhelm Meendsen-Bohlken‚Äîleft Narvik and entered the Barents Sea. Along with it went U-boats , commanded by Captain Grau, and , commanded by Lieutenant Captain Timm, as well as destroyers , and . =Kara Sea= By 19 August, the German fleet rounded Cape Zhelaniya and entered the Kara Sea which was fairly free from ice during the short summer. The next day, the Arado Ar 196 seaplane on board Admiral Scheer flew to Kravkova Island in the Mona Islands and spotted three groups of Soviet ships, including icebreakers and . Fog and ice floes prevented the German warships from approaching. When they arrived at the Mona Islands, the Russian ships were gone. Admiral Scheer then turned northeast and sped towards the Nordenski√∂ld Archipelago. On 24 August, U-601 sank the Soviet steamer Kuybyshev (2,332 BRT). On 25 August, Admiral Scheer fell upon the Russian icebreaker (under the command of Captain Anatoli Kacharava) right off the northwest coast of Russky Island at the northern end of the Nordenski√∂ld Archipelago. After putting up resistance, Sibiryakov was sunk in an unequal battle.Sinking of Sibiryakov Admiral Scheer headed back to the Mona Islands, but not finding any ships, sailed again to the Nordenski√∂ld Archipelago, trying to straddle the two convoy routes from the Vilkitsky Strait. Since it was unable to find any Soviet ships, Admiral Scheer headed southeast towards Dikson Island in order to attack its military installations. Its powerful guns caused random destruction ashore at Dikson and badly damaged the ships and Revolutsioner anchored in the harbour. On 30 August, Admiral Scheer returned to Narvik.Wunderland explained: Comprehensive historical account On 8 September, U-251 surfaced close to Uyedineniya Island and destroyed a Soviet weather station with gunfire.L. Peillard, Geschichte des U-Bootkrieges 1939‚àí1945. 1970. =Barents Sea= During the operation, (Lt. Captain Brodda) sank, on 17 August, a transport convoy of the Soviet Secret Service (NKVD) composed of cargo ships Nord and Komsomolets and light vessels Sh-III and P-IV west of the Yugorsky Strait. Apparently there were 328 political prisoners on board, of which 305 men were killed through artillery fire or drowning. Meanwhile, on 20 August, (Lt. Captain Max-Martin Teichert) tried to sink the Soviet icebreaker off Belushya Guba with torpedoes but was unsuccessful. and U-209 emerged and bombarded Soviet targets in Cape Zhelaniya and Khodovarikha on 25 and 28 August respectively.Attack at Cape Zhelaniya Conclusion Operation Wunderland was only moderately successful. Owing to adverse weather conditions and the abundance of ice floes, the vessels taking part in Operation Wunderland did not venture beyond the Vilkitsky Strait. Therefore, the Kriegsmarine campaign only affected the Barents Sea and the Kara Sea. By mid-September it had to be stopped because of the freezing of the sea surface with thick pack-ice, especially in the Kara Sea, which not being affected by the warmer Atlantic currents freezes much earlier.German Naval Warfare in 1942 Footnotes References * External links * Russian Military History (in Russian) * Military Operations in the Arctic (in Russian) * History of the Northern Sea Route Category:Arctic convoys of World War II Category:Arctic naval operations of World War II Category:August 1942 events Category:Barents Sea Category:Conflicts in 1942 Category:Kara Sea Category:Military operations of World War II Category:Naval battles of World War II involving Germany Category:Naval battles of World War II involving the Soviet Union Category:October 1942 events Category:September 1942 events ","title":"Operation Wunderland"},{"id":"13617105","text":"Gabriel Zamora is a municipality in the center of the Mexican square kilometres (0.72% of the surface of the state)Michoac√°n Enciclopedia de los Municipios de M√©xico.

Life  Kaufmann was the second son of a wealthy, Jewish merchant family in Ia≈üi, Romania. In early childhood, he moved with his mother and siblings to Vienna, where he eventually attended university. He studied law and attended lectures on the history of literature and philosophy. He earned his doctorate in 1896. For a short period he worked as a legal apprentice, but his family's prosperous circumstance soon afforded him the means to live independently from his inheritance. Kaufmann considered himself primarily a philosopher. He worked for decades on a comprehensive philosophical opus, embracing Immanuel Kant and Johann Wolfgang von Goethe‚Äôs ideas in particular, but never completed it. His only publication was a piece on Albert Einstein's Theory of relativity.See Section Publications A philosophical fairy tale is, as his whole bequest, lost. Kaufmann regularly attended the Viennese chess club and ultimately became an internationally recognized player. In 1892, he tied for 5-6th (Adolf Albin won), shared 3rd in 1893/94 (Jacques Schwarz won), twice took 2nd in 1896 and 1897/98, both behind Georg Marco. He drew a match with Marco (+5 -5 =0) in 1893.Welcome to the Chessmetrics site In 1914/15, he took 2nd, behind Carl Schlechter, in Vienna (Trebitsch Memorial). He took 3rd at Vienna 1915 (Quadrangular, Schlechter won), and 3rd place, behind Schlechter and Milan Vidmar, at Vienna 1916 (Triangular). He won matches against Richard R√©ti (+4 -1 =1) in 1915, and Savielly Tartakower (+2 -0 =2) in 1916.ChessGames.com Online Chess Games Database In January 1917, with his best, historic ELO-stat of 2637, he was the eighth-best in the worldwide chess ranking (established thereafter).See Arthur Kaufmann at chessmetrics.com Due to unknown reasons, he ended his career as a chess player in 1917.See Urcan/Braunwarth 2012, p. 75 Kaufmann was a close friend of the Austrian author, Arthur Schnitzler, who mentioned his encounters with Kaufmann in his diary several times, expressing his appreciation of Kaufmann's personality and character. In his last will, Schnitzler appointed Kaufmann, in addition to the Austrian author, Richard Beer-Hofmann, as advisor to his son, Heinrich, in all issues regarding his literary legacy. Schnitzler's literary estate, with its notes and letters, comprises the main source of information on Kaufmann's life and ideas.See Arthur Schnitzler: Tagebuch 1879-1931, ed. by ‚ÄúKommission f√ºr literarische Gebrauchsformen der √ñsterreichischen Akademie der Wissenschaften‚Äù, 10 vol., Wien 1981-2000 (German) Impoverished, due to World War I, Kaufmann and his younger sister, Malwine, moved from Vienna to Mariazell in 1918, and then to Altaussee in 1920, because life in the countryside was less expensive. Beginning in 1923, Kaufmann spent the next ten or so years as a guest of the Viennese industrialist, Wilhelm von Gutmann, in the castle of W√ºrting, near Lambach, in Upper-Austria, before returning to Vienna. (For a number of years, Richard von Coudenhove-Kalergi, the founder of the Paneuropean Union, also enjoyed the hospitality of the Gutmann-family at the castle of W√ºrting.) According to the official announcement, Kaufmann died on the July 25, 1938, of ‚Äúsudden cardiac death and arteriosclerosis‚Äù, but various indicators point to suicide.See Urcan/Braunwarth, p. 133: ‚ÄûWhile putting together the existing evidence summarized above is by no means an act devoid of a certain, even if minimal, dose of speculation, it appears that Kaufmann's death was in fact a suicide.‚Äù He was buried in the Jewish section of the Viennese Central Cemetery, where bombing in WW II devastated his grave. In his last will and testament, he appointed as his heirs, his nieces, Alice Kaufmann and Sophie Kaufmann (daughters of his brother, Ludwig Kaufmann), who at that time, and following WW II, lived in Paris, at rue Molitor 56. All attempts to find Kaufmann's written bequest, as well as photographs of him, have been unsuccessful so far.Regarding photographs of Arthur Kaufmann see Urcan/Braunwarth, p. 238-241  Publications  Arthur Kaufmann: Zur Relativit√§tstheorie.

Description Eleutheronema tetradactylum has two dorsal fins the first has 9 spines and the second has 13-15 soft rays with 13 being the mean. The anal fin has 3 spines and 14-19 soft rays. The pectoral fins have 16-18 rays and there are 4 pectoral filaments. The upper sides of the head and body have a slight darkish silver tinge, lighting in the lower flanks. Both dorsal fins show a blackish anterior margin with the remaining parts of the fins translucent and slightly dusky. The membranes of the pectoral fins are vivid yellow in smaller individuals but in larger fish this becomes duskier. The pectoral filaments are white. The pelvic fins are white with a yellow front edge while the caudal fin is blackish with a yellowish base. This species can attain a maximum total length of , although is a more normal size. Distribution Eleutheronema tetradactylum has an Indo-Pacific distribution and ranges from the Persian Gulf to Australia and Papua New Guinea, Habitat and biology Eleutheronema tetradactylum adults show a preference for shallow muddy substrates in coastal waters and they may enter rivers. The juveniles occur in estuaries. In the winter the adults move up rivers. It is normally observed in loose schools, but larger fish are more often recorded as pairs or individuals. It is a carnivorous species which preys on prawns and fish. The fish preyed upon are mainly grey mullets, anchovies and drums, and they sometimes feed on polychaetes. The ratio of crustaceans to fish fed on varies with the season. The small larvae have a diet dominated by copepods and mysids although they also feed on small decapods while larger juveniles feed prawns and mysids. This species is a protandrous hermaphrodite and Australian studies found that they were males at fork length of , hermaphrodites at fork lengths between FL and females are found at fork lengths of . Off the northeast cost of Queensland, most of the fish with fork lengths greater than are females. The hermaphroditic fish form once they reach 1-2-year old, and then females begin to appear at 2-3-years old. It is thought that the males change to hermaphrodites just after spawning in April and May and they remain in a hermaphroditic state until the next breeding season is over. They then progress from hermaphrodites to females before the breeding season after that. The larval stage is little known but it is known that lower estuaries, tidal swamps and lagoons, and the shallows along the foreshores are used as nursery areas. Usage Eleutheronema tetradactylum is marketed fresh, frozen, and dried or salted. This species is also used in aquaculture. This species is one of an important commercial quarry for fisheries in Kuwait and the species is also taken as bycatch. They are one of the more expensive fish in the Kuwaiti and Iranian markets. Conservation Eleutheronema tetradactylum has not had its global conservation status evaluated by the IUCN but it has been classified as Endangered in the Persian Gulf where the population appears to be in a rapid decline. Common names Eleutheronema tetradactylum is a widespread and commercially important species and, as such, has a number of English common names, other than the fourfinger threadfin. In Australia it is known as the blue threadfin, although other names include blind tassel-fish, blue salmon, bluenose salmon, blunt-nosed salmon, burnett salmon, Colonial salmon, Cooktown salmon, giant threadfin, kingfish, Rockhampton kingfish, Rockhampton salmon, tassel-fish and threadfin. In India names used include Indian salmon, white salmon, row ball and horse's friend.

The California Office of Environmental Health Hazard Assessment has issued a safe advisory for any fish caught in Bear River due to elevated levels of mercury. Geography The headwaters at Bear Valley, seen from Emigrant Gap The Bear River originates at Emigrant Gap, as a tiny stream on the border of Nevada and Placer Counties in the Tahoe National Forest. The headwaters are on a ridge immediately to the south of the South Yuba River and north of the North Fork American River. The river flows west into the Bear Valley then enters a deep and narrow gorge, passing the community of Dutch Flat. Continuing along the Nevada‚ÄìPlacer County line it receives Steephollow Creek from the north before widening into Rollins Reservoir, formed by the high Rollins Dam east of Chicago Park. While part of the reservoir, the river is joined by Greenhorn Creek from the north.Course info from USGS topographic maps. Below the dam the river flows southwest through the Sierra foothills, past Colfax and Meadow Vista, through Lake Combie and a short but rugged gorge above Garden Bar. Shortly downstream it widens into Camp Far West Reservoir, where it begins to define the Placer‚ÄìYuba County border. Further west it flows into the Sacramento Valley where it forms a large alluvial floodplain. Starting at Wheatland it forms the border of Yuba and Sutter Counties. A few miles below this point it receives Dry Creek from the north, then flows into the Feather River at Nicolaus, above the Feather's confluence with the larger Sacramento River, and about due south of Yuba City‚ÄìMarysville. With a mean annual flow of at Wheatland, the Bear is the smallest major tributary of the Feather River. Monthly flows range from in March to in September. Because the Bear River watershed is at a relatively low elevation compared to other Sierra streams, rainfall, not snowmelt, is the main source of runoff. The flow rate is also heavily influenced by numerous dams and diversions on the river. Geology The Bear River is considered an underfit stream, as a much larger, snow-fed river flowed through its channel in ancient times. Millions of years ago the upper part of the South Yuba River (above Lake Spaulding) flowed into the Bear River at Emigrant Gap. Stream piracy, possibly assisted by glaciation during the Ice Ages, caused the upper Bear to be \\"captured\\" into the Yuba drainage to the north and shortening the Bear by about as a result. History Gold miners using hydraulic mining to excavate an eroded bluff with jets of water at Dutch Flat, California, sometime between 1857 and 1870. The Bear River basin is in California's Gold Country and was one of the richest areas of the 19th century California Gold Rush. Major mining sites in the Bear River basin included You Bet, Red Dog, Dutch Flat, Gold Run, Waloupa, Little York, and Chalk Bluff.History of Tahoe National Forest: 1840‚Äì1940, Chapter 3 , United States Forest Service Large amounts of land in the Bear River drainage were radically altered by hydraulic mining. At You Bet and Red Dog of gold-bearing gravel was washed out; at Dutch Flat ; and at Gold Run . Engineering The Bear River has been significantly dammed and diverted for irrigation, domestic water supply, and hydropower generation. The river flow has been greatly augmented via diversions from the larger Yuba River basin to the north, via the Drum-Spaulding Hydroelectric Project and Yuba-Bear Hydroelectric Project. The former, completed in the 1910s primarily for hydropower generation is owned by PG&E; the latter was built in the 1960s by the Nevada Irrigation District (NID). Although nominally two separate projects, the complex system of some 40 reservoirs in the Middle and South Forks of the Yuba and on the upper Bear River is heavily interconnected, and operated as one. About of water from the Yuba River Basin enters the Bear River Basin via the Drum Canal, which is fed by a tunnel from Lake Spaulding. The uppermost dams on the Bear River are at Dutch Flat Forebay and Dutch Flat Afterbay, both small hydroelectric diversion dams. Water from the upper Bear River and the Drum Canal pass through these dams and drive powerhouses at Drum, Dutch Flat and Chicago Park. Below Chicago Park Powerhouse, at the confluence of Greenhorn Creek, the Bear River is impounded by Rollins Dam, which forms a reservoir. The reservoir stores water for irrigation and hydroelectricity, and serves the important purpose of trapping sediment from early hydraulic mining activity in the upper Bear River basin. Directly below Rollins Dam lies the Bear River Diversion Dam, which diverts about of water per year into the Bear River Canal, which provides for several rural communities in Placer County between Colfax and Auburn. Excess water from the canal enters the American River basin via a powerhouse at Folsom Lake. The remaining water in the Bear River flows downstream to Lake Combie, which holds about . The Van Giesen Dam, which forms the lake, is the oldest dam on the Bear River proper, completed in 1928. The dam diverts water into the Combie Aqueduct, which supplies about 40 percent of the water for NID's lower division, about per year. Further downstream is Camp Far West Dam, which forms the largest reservoir on the river at . The reservoir provides for both flood control and irrigation in the lower valley of the Bear River. Another mile downstream lies Camp Far West Diversion Dam, the final dam on the river, which diverts per year into the South Sutter and Camp Far West Canals to irrigate about of the Sacramento Valley. About 80 percent of the South Sutter irrigation district is planted with rice. =Dam proposals= In July 2011, a dam project for the Bear River was revealed to be under study by a consortium of out of area water districts. The South Sutter Water District (Trowbridge), along with the cities of Napa, American Canyon, and Palmdale, the Castaic Lake Water Agency, and the San Bernardino Valley Municipal Water District, issued a preliminary study on siting a new dam north of the present Camp Far West Reservoir and south of Combie and Rollins reservoirs farther upstream. The dam would be in the NID (Nevada Irrigation District) water district and would flood portions of Nevada County and Placer County. The proposed Garden Bar Dam would be located in areas already set aside as conservation and wildlife areas, and the resulting lake would inundate prime wildlife habitat and oak and savannah grasslands. Because of concerns that the water that would fill the proposed large reservoir (, according to the study, the largest option would be ) is already allocated for existing impoundment lakes by dams on the Bear River at Camp Far West, Combie, and Rollins, the actual feasibility of the project seems speculative, and has raised doubts as to the actual purpose of the proposal. A quote from the study says \\"Water Availability: The report acknowledges the existence of \\"numerous issues that would need to be resolved to confirm the availability of this water and the ability to convey a portion of it through the Delta, if so desired.\\" Due to poor economic justifications and opposition from the conservation group, Sierra Watch, local land trusts, ranchers, and the board of supervisors of both Placer and Nevada Counties, the water district dropped the proposed Garden Bar Dam in July 2012. In 2014, the NID put forth another plan for a new dam/reservoir on the Bear River at the Parker site, located just above Lake Combie. Upon approval, the proposed Centennial Dam would store about . The \\"Save the Bear, Stop Centennial\\" campaign was created in opposition to the proposal by non-profit environmental organizations, the Foothills Water Network and South Yuba River Citizens League (SYRCL), with the support of other community and conservation groups such as Sierra Watch.

In August 2008 Walters lost to tough journeyman Shawn Hammack (16-6-2) in a bout that he seemed to be well on his way to winning, getting caught in the final round and stopped with 30 seconds to go. Another loss followed to Byron Mitchell (26-4-1) in February 2009 for the NABA United States Light Heavyweight title. Walters returned four months later to win in Duluth, but after a December 2009 loss to Larry Sharpe by 1st round TKO he announced his retirement. Walters' career record was 24-5 with 19 wins by knockout.

The Incredible World of Japanese Fantasy Films Venice, California: Feral House. 1998. Pg. 165 Plot In a remote village in the province of Tanba, a household of peasants cowers during a series of earth tremors that are interpreted as the escape attempts of Arakatsuma (ÈòøÁæÖÁæØÁ£®), also known as Daimajin (Â§ßÈ≠îÁ•û 'Great Demon God'), a violent divine spirit said to be trapped within the nearby mountain held in fear and reverence by the locals. As the village gathers at the local shrine to perform an ancient ritual to pacify Daimajin, ≈ådate Samanosuke (Ry≈´tar≈ç Gomi), chamberlain to the local lord Hanabusa Tadakiyo (Ry≈´z≈ç Shimada), stages a coup d'√©tat. He and his henchmen slaughter Hanabusa and his wife, but their son and daughter escape, aided by the heroic samurai Kogenta (Jun Fujimaki). Back at the shrine, Samanosuke's men break up the ceremony, forbidding all such gatherings in the future. The elderly priestess, Shinobu (Otome Tsukimiya), issues a dire warning, but the men ignore her. Kogenta takes the two children to his aunt Shinobu's house. The priestess takes them up the mountain, into forbidden territory, where a gigantic stone idol of the mountain god who had sealed Daimajin long ago stands half-buried atop a waterfall. Near this idol is an ancient temple - safe as only Shinobu knows of its existence. The children grow to adulthood. The son, Tadafumi (Yoshihiko Aoyama) reaches his 18th birthday. The years have been miserable on the villagers. Samanosuke is a brutal leader (in one scene, he gouges out an old woman's eye with a red-hot iron hook) who is using every man in the starving village as slave labor. The place is ripe for revolution, and surviving Hanabusa retainers are starting to return. Kogenta journeys to the village to try to gather the old retainers, but gets himself captured. A boy, Take-b≈ç, gets word to Tadafumi and his sister, Kozasa (Miwa Takada) that their friend is a prisoner. Tadafumi tries to rescue him, only to discover it's a trap. With both awaiting execution, Shinobu tries to talk to the tyrant, warning him that the god of the mountain's curse will befall him should he continue his evildoing ways. Samanosuke, refusing to heed Shinobu's words, kills her and orders the idol demolished. With her dying breath, Shinobu curses Samanosuke to die a harsh, merciless death and declares that if he attempts to destroy the idol, the wrathful Arakatsuma sealed inside it will come out. The crew that travels up the mountain to smash the idol accidentally discovers Kozasa and Take-b≈ç, and force them to take them to the statue. The soldiers bring out an enormous chisel and proceed to hammer it into the idol's head; they stop when they see blood beginning to drip from it. Horrified, the men attempt to flee, but the earth cracks open and swallows them. Kozasa begs the god of the mountain to save her brother and Kogenta and punish the wicked Samanosuke. At the fortress, Tadafumi and Kogenta are tied to large crosses, awaiting their fates. Kozasa offers her life to the god and attempts to throw herself over the nearby waterfall, but the rock and earth covering the lower half of the idol fall away, and it comes to life. As it walks out into the clearing, Kozasa prostrates herself before it; the idol, animated by the reawakened Daimajin Arakatsuma, assumes a terrifying appearance and goes to Samanosuke's stronghold. Daimajin rescues both Kogenta and Tadafumi and proceeds to utterly destroy the fortress. After impaling Samanosuke with the chisel on its forehead, Daimajin now turns its wrath upon everyone in sight. Take-b≈ç unsuccessfully begs Daimajin to stop; as the boy was about to get trampled on by the idol, Kozasa steps in and saves him. Kozasa tearfully pleads Daimajin to cease its rampage, letting her tears fall on its stone feet. Its anger now quelled, Daimajin's spirit leaves the idol, restoring it to its former appearance before it collapses into a heap of rubble.

Eagle 56s boiler was overhauled just two weeks before the sinking, and none of the boilers on the other 59 Eagle Boats had failed. Nevertheless, the official Navy inquiry concluded that Eagle 56 had suffered a boiler explosion. Later events On 5 May 1945, U-853 sank the collier Black Point off the coast of Point Judith, Rhode Island, causing the loss of 12 lives. During the ensuing Battle of Point Judith, U-853 was chased and sunk by Navy and Coast Guard ships on 6 May. On 1 June 1945, Rear Admiral Felix X. Gygax wrote, \\"at least equal evidence to support the conclusion that the explosion was that of a device outside the ship, the exact nature of which is undetermined. It might have been an enemy mine or an enemy torpedo.\\" Ultimately, though, he endorsed the court's findings. Because the Allies had cracked Germany's codes, United States intelligence knew in 1945 that U-boats had been sent across the North Atlantic to disrupt shipping in hopes of obtaining better surrender terms. However, only general warnings rather than specific information about this plan were passed to commanders. =Reclassification= Plaque at Portland remembering the loss In 2001, the Naval Historical Center reviewed the case and reclassified the sinking as a combat loss.

It is the third most popular pilgrimage site in France, after Lourdes and Lisieux. History Sainte-Anne-d'Auray is a village in the Diocese of Vannes (Morbihan), in Brittany, famous for its sanctuary and for its pilgrimages, or \\"pardons\\", in honour of St. Anne, to whom the people of Brittany, in very early times, on becoming Christian, had dedicated a chapel. This first chapel was destroyed about the end of the seventh century, but the memory of it was kept alive by tradition, and the hamlet was called \\"Keranna\\", i.e. \\"Village of Anne\\".\\"Grand Pardon de Sainte-Anne\\", Tourist Board of Morbihan More than nine centuries later, at the beginning of the seventeenth century (1624‚Äì25), St. Anne is said to have appeared several times to a simple and pious village farmer, and commanded him to rebuild the ancient chapel. The apparitions became so frequent, and before so many witnesses, that Sebastien de Rosmadec, Bishop of Vannes, deemed it his duty to inquire into the matter. Yves Nicolazic, to whom St. Anne had appeared, and numerous witnesses, testified to the truth of events which had become famous throughout Brittany, and around 1630 the Bishop gave permission for the building of a chapel. Anne of Austria and Louis XIII enriched the sanctuary with many gifts, among them a relic of St. Anne brought from Jerusalem in the thirteenth century, and in 1641 the Queen obtained from the Pope the erection of a confraternity, which Pius IX raised to the rank of an archconfraternity in 1872. In the meanwhile pilgrimages had begun and became more numerous year by year, nor did the Revolution put a stop to them. The chapel, indeed was plundered, the Carmelites who served it driven out, and the miraculous statue of St. Anne was burned at Vannes in 1793; yet the faithful still flocked to the chapel, which was covered with ex-votos. In 1810 the convent of the Carmelites was turned into a petit s√©minaire. In 1866, the Cardinal Saint Marc laid and blessed the first stone of the present basilica. A new statute of Saint Anne was solemnly consecrated by order of Pius IX, 30 September 1868.Goyau, Georges. \\"Diocese of Vannes.\\" The Catholic Encyclopedia Vol. 15.

Every summer, there is the Grand Pardon of Sainte Anne, the largest pilgrimage in the region on July 26, the feast of St. Anne. The religious services are followed by picnics, dancing and entertainment. Basilica The most notable feature of the village is the large Basilica of Sainte-Anne d'Auray, which is a major site of pilgrimage. Saint Anne is the patron saint of Brittany. The Basilica was built in Neo-Gothic style from 1865 to 1872 to replace an earlier church which had housed the ancient statue of Anne said to have been miraculously discovered by Yves Nicolazic. Nicolazic's house Not far from the Basilica is the house where Yves Nicolazic and his family lived. The house was severely damaged in a fire in 1902, but restored five years later.

The couple were married for 49 years. Snow leopards Freeman's interest in Snow Leopards began while she was a volunteer docent at the Woodland Park Zoo in Seattle. The zoo acquired two Snow Leopards, named Nicholas and Alexandra, from the Soviet Union in 1972. Freeman eventually became the curator of education at the Woodland Park Zoo. She held that position when she founded the Snow Leopard Trust in 1981. The original purpose of the trust was to help zoos keep Snow Leopards, which are endangered in their home ranges in Central Asia, more successfully. She often traveled to Asia, Europe and North America, to raise awareness of the species's endangered status. She was the first female chair of the Snow Leopard Species Survival Plan, a breeding program designed to help increase the numbers of Snow Leopards in captivity; the species is notoriously difficult to breed in zoos. Freeman's Snow Leopard Trust began pioneering plans to help people living in areas inhabited by Snow Leopards to improve their standards of living in order to better protect both the leopards and their habitat. She remained the Executive Director of the Snow Leopard Trust until 1996 when she took a position on the Trust's board of directors.

She was effective in performing blockade duty, and captured a number of Confederate blockade runners.  Construction, launch, and acquisition  Cornelius and Richard Poillon built Onward at their shipyard at the foot of Bridge Street in Brooklyn, New York. She was launched into the East River on March 28, 1863. She was purchased by the US Navy from the Poillons on 14 September 1863 for $190,000. She was commissioned as USS Grand Gulf on 28 September 1863, Comdr. George Ransom in command.  Assigned to the North Atlantic Blockade  Grand Gulf stood to sea from New York on 11 October and 9 days later joined the North Atlantic Blockading Squadron off Wilmington, North Carolina. Her two exits to the sea at Beaufort and the Cape Fear River made Wilmington one of the most important and most difficult to blockade of all Confederate ports. She remained on blockade duty there, with intervals for repair at the New York and Norfolk Navy Yards, until 4 October 1864.  Capturing blockade runners and their valuable cargoes  On 21 November 1863, assisted by Army Transport Fulton, Grand Gulf took blockade runner Banshee with a general cargo of contraband from Nassau. Off the Carolina coast, Grand Gulf, 6 March 1864, captured the British steamer Mary Ann trying to run the blockade with a cargo of cotton and tobacco; seizing the cargo and 82 passengers and crew members, Grand Gulf put a prize crew on the steamer and sent her to Boston, Massachusetts. A second British ship, Young Republic, fell captive to Grand Gulf after a wild chase 6 May 1864, with both ships steaming at full speed and the blockade runner throwing overboard bale after bale of precious cotton and even the anchor chain in a futile attempt to lighten ship. Grand Gulf garnered some 253 bales of cotton as well as 54 prisoners from this prize. Two weeks later, Rear Admiral Samuel Phillips Lee wrote Ransom congratulating him on taking the prize; \\"Every capture made by blockaders deprives the enemy of so much of the 'sinews of war,' and is equal to the taking of two supply trains from the rebel Army.\\"  Searching for Confederate raider Tallahassee  Returning to New York 4 August 1864, she was ordered out in search of the Confederate raider CSS Tallahassee, reported in Long Island Sound. However, 17 August she gave over the search to tow into port demasted brig Billow, and claim her as a prize. Billow had been captured by Tallahassee; scuttled but did not sink. Grand Gulf left New York 23 September to convoy California steamer Ocean Queen to Aspinwall (now Colon), Panama, arriving there 3 October and returning to New York 16 October. From 24 October to 16 November she and Ocean Queen repeated the voyage. One day from New York on the outward passage, Grand Gulf, herself leaking badly, took into tow sinking British bark Linden. She then put into New York Navy Yard for extensive repairs.  Reassigned to the West Gulf Blockade  With the ironclad in tow, Grand Gulf put to sea 8 March 1865; arriving at Hampton Roads 12 March, she left Casco there and 17 March sailed to join the West Gulf Blockading Fleet off Galveston, Texas. She reached Galveston 4 April and remained on blockade duty until 25 June, when she steamed up the Mississippi River to New Orleans, Louisiana. There she served as a prison ship and site for courts-martial until 18 October, when she cleared New Orleans for New York, New York.  Decommissioning  Grand Gulf arrived in New York on November 2, 1865. She was decommissioned on November 10, and was sold on November 30 to C. Comstock & Co for $86,000. She was later resold to William F. Feld & Co. of Boston, Massachusetts. Renamed General Grant; the ship sailed in the Merchants' Boston and New Orleans Steamship Company operating between Boston and New Orleans.

This mechanism is used by companies such as Amazon, Google, Facebook, Microsoft and Twitter to permit the users to share information about their accounts with third party applications or websites. Generally, OAuth provides clients a \\"secure delegated access\\" to server resources on behalf of a resource owner. It specifies a process for resource owners to authorize third-party access to their server resources without sharing their credentials. Designed specifically to work with Hypertext Transfer Protocol (HTTP), OAuth essentially allows access tokens to be issued to third-party clients by an authorization server, with the approval of the resource owner. The third party then uses the access token to access the protected resources hosted by the resource server. OAuth is a service that is complementary to and distinct from OpenID. OAuth is unrelated to OATH, which is a reference architecture for authentication, not a standard for authorization. However, OAuth is directly related to OpenID Connect (OIDC), since OIDC is an authentication layer built on top of OAuth 2.0. OAuth is also unrelated to XACML, which is an authorization policy standard. OAuth can be used in conjunction with XACML, where OAuth is used for ownership consent and access delegation whereas XACML is used to define the authorization policies (e.g., managers can view documents in their region).  History  OAuth began in November 2006 when Blaine Cook was developing the Twitter OpenID implementation. Meanwhile, Ma.gnolia needed a solution to allow its members with OpenIDs to authorize Dashboard Widgets to access their service. Cook, Chris Messina and Larry Halff from Magnolia met with David Recordon to discuss using OpenID with the Twitter and Magnolia APIs to delegate authentication. They concluded that there were no open standards for API access delegation. The OAuth discussion group was created in April 2007, for the small group of implementers to write the draft proposal for an open protocol. DeWitt Clinton from Google learned of the OAuth project, and expressed his interest in supporting the effort. In July 2007, the team drafted an initial specification. Eran Hammer joined and coordinated the many OAuth contributions creating a more formal specification. On 4 December 2007, the OAuth Core 1.0 final draft was released. At the 73rd Internet Engineering Task Force (IETF) meeting in Minneapolis in November 2008, an OAuth BoF was held to discuss bringing the protocol into the IETF for further standardization work. The event was well attended and there was wide support for formally chartering an OAuth working group within the IETF. The OAuth 1.0 protocol was published as RFC 5849, an informational Request for Comments, in April 2010. Since 31 August 2010, all third party Twitter applications have been required to use OAuth. The OAuth 2.0 framework was published as RFC 6749, and the Bearer Token Usage as RFC 6750, both standards track Requests for Comments, in October 2012.  OAuth 2.0  OAuth 2.0 is not backwards compatible with OAuth 1.0. OAuth 2.0 provides specific authorization flows for web applications, desktop applications, mobile phones, and smart devices. The specification and associated RFCs are developed by the IETF OAuth WG; the main framework was published in October 2012. Facebook's Graph API only supports OAuth 2.0. Google supports OAuth 2.0 as the recommended authorization mechanism for all of its APIs. Microsoft also supports OAuth 2.0 for various APIs and its Azure Active Directory service, which is used to secure many Microsoft and third party APIs. The OAuth 2.0 Framework and Bearer Token Usage were published in October 2012.  Security  = OAuth 1.0 = On 23 April 2009, a session fixation security flaw in the 1.0 protocol was announced. It affects the OAuth authorization flow (also known as \\"3-legged OAuth\\") in OAuth Core 1.0 Section 6. Version 1.0a of the OAuth Core protocol was issued to address this issue. = OAuth 2.0 = In January 2013, the Internet Engineering Task Force published a threat model for OAuth 2.0.[rfc:6819 OAuth 2.0 Threat Model and Security Considerations]. Internet Engineering Task Force. Accessed January 2015. Among the threats outlined is one called \\"Open Redirector\\"; in the spring of 2014, a variant of this was described under the name \\"Covert Redirect\\" by Wang Jing. OAuth 2.0 has been analyzed using formal web protocol analysis. This analysis revealed that in setups with multiple authorization servers, one of which is behaving maliciously, clients can become confused about the authorization server to use and may forward secrets to the malicious authorization server (AS Mix-Up Attack). This prompted the creation of a new best current practice internet draft that sets out to define a new security standard for OAuth 2.0. Assuming a fix against the AS Mix-Up Attack in place, the security of OAuth 2.0 has been proven under strong attacker models using formal analysis. One implementation of OAuth 2.0 with numerous security flaws has been exposed. In April‚ÄìMay 2017, about one million users of Gmail (less than 0.1% of users as of May 2017) were targeted by an OAuth-based phishing attack, receiving an email purporting to be from a colleague, employer or friend wanting to share a document on Google Docs. Those who clicked on the link within the email were directed to sign in and allow a potentially malicious third-party program called \\"Google Apps\\" to access their \\"email account, contacts and online documents\\". Within \\"approximately one hour\\", the phishing attack was stopped by Google, who advised those who had given \\"Google Apps\\" access to their email to revoke such access and change their passwords.  Uses  OAuth can be used as an authorizing mechanism to consume secured RSS/ATOM feeds. Consumption of RSS/ATOM feeds that require authentication has always been an issue. For example, an RSS feed from a secured Google Site could not have been consumed using Google Reader. Instead, three-legged OAuth would have been used to authorize that RSS client to access the feed from the Google Site. It can also be used as a means to login without creating an account on any site and all the benefits of the host of the OAuth system.  OAuth and other standards  = OpenID vs. pseudo-authentication using OAuth = OAuth is an authorization protocol, rather than an authentication protocol. Using OAuth on its own as an authentication method may be referred to as pseudo-authentication. The following diagrams highlight the differences between using OpenID (specifically designed as an authentication protocol) and OAuth for authorization. The communication flow in both processes is similar: # (Not pictured) The user requests a resource or site login from the application. # The site sees that the user is not authenticated. It formulates a request for the identity provider, encodes it, and sends it to the user as part of a redirect URL. # The user's browser requests the redirect URL for the identity provider, including the application's request # If necessary, the identity provider authenticates the user (perhaps by asking them for their username and password) # Once the identity provider is satisfied that the user is sufficiently authenticated, it processes the application's request, formulates a response, and sends that back to the user along with a redirect URL back to the application. # The user's browser requests the redirect URL that goes back to the application, including the identity provider's response # The application decodes the identity provider's response, and carries on accordingly. # (OAuth only) The response includes an access token which the application can use to gain direct access to the identity provider's services on the user's behalf. The crucial difference is that in the OpenID authentication use case, the response from the identity provider is an assertion of identity; while in the OAuth authorization use case, the identity provider is also an API provider, and the response from the identity provider is an access token that may grant the application ongoing access to some of the identity provider's APIs, on the user's behalf. The access token acts as a kind of \\"valet key\\" that the application can include with its requests to the identity provider, which prove that it has permission from the user to access those APIs. Because the identity provider typically (but not always) authenticates the user as part of the process of granting an OAuth access token, it's tempting to view a successful OAuth access token request as an authentication method itself. However, because OAuth was not designed with this use case in mind, making this assumption can lead to major security flaws. OpenID vs. pseudo-authentication using OAuth = OAuth and XACML = XACML is a policy-based, attribute-based access control authorization framework. It provides: * An access control architecture. * A policy language with which to express a wide range of access control policies including policies that can use consents handled / defined via OAuth. * A request / response scheme to send and receive authorization requests. XACML and OAuth can be combined together to deliver a more comprehensive approach to authorization. OAuth does not provide a policy language with which to define access control policies. XACML can be used for its policy language. Where OAuth focuses on delegated access (I, the user, grant Twitter access to my Facebook wall), and identity-centric authorization, XACML takes an attribute- based approach which can consider attributes of the user, the action, the resource, and the context (who, what, where, when, how). With XACML it is possible to define policies such as * Managers can view documents in their department * Managers can edit documents they own in draft mode XACML provides more fine-grained access control than OAuth does. OAuth is limited in granularity to the coarse functionality (the scopes) exposed by the target service. As a result, it often makes sense to combine OAuth and XACML together where OAuth will provide the delegated access use case and consent management and XACML will provide the authorization policies that work on the applications, processes, and data. Lastly, XACML can work transparently across multiple stacks (APIs, web SSO, ESBs, home-grown apps, databases...). OAuth focuses exclusively on HTTP-based apps.  Controversy  Eran Hammer resigned from his role of lead author for the OAuth 2.0 project, withdrew from the IETF working group, and removed his name from the specification in July 2012. Hammer cited a conflict between web and enterprise cultures as his reason for leaving, noting that IETF is a community that is \\"all about enterprise use cases\\" and \\"not capable of simple.\\" \\"What is now offered is a blueprint for an authorization protocol,\\" he noted, \\"that is the enterprise way,\\" providing a \\"whole new frontier to sell consulting services and integration solutions.\\" In comparing OAuth 2.0 with OAuth 1.0, Hammer points out that it has become \\"more complex, less interoperable, less useful, more incomplete, and most importantly, less secure.\\" He explains how architectural changes for 2.0 unbound tokens from clients, removed all signatures and cryptography at a protocol level and added expiring tokens (because tokens couldn't be revoked) while complicating the processing of authorization. Numerous items were left unspecified or unlimited in the specification because \\"as has been the nature of this working group, no issue is too small to get stuck on or leave open for each implementation to decide.\\" David Recordon later also removed his name from the specifications for unspecified reasons. Dick Hardt took over the editor role, and the framework was published in October 2012.

History The battles at Gallipoli, some of whose participating soldiers are buried at this cemetery, was an eight-month campaign fought by Commonwealth and French forces against Ottoman Empire forces in an attempt to force the Ottoman Empire out of the war, which it was hoped would relieve the deadlock of the Western Front and to open a supply route between Russia and the Mediterranean through the Dardanelles and the Black Sea. Shrapnel Valley Cemetery Gallipoli Turkey (1915) Pte Victor Laidlaw State Library Victoria H84.356/37 Following the landing at Anzac Cove in April 1915, Shrapnel Valley (or Shrapnel Gully) became the main route for Allied troops and supplies between the beach and the frontline in the Anzac sector. Falling shrapnel made a distinctive whistling before striking the area. It was during the battles in the early days of the campaign that the name for the gully was coined. Later, several wells were dug in the valley and camps and gun emplacements constructed in the lower end. On the night of 18 to 19 May 1915, the 5th Light Horse Regiment from Queensland began an offensive through the valley. The cemetery is a trapezoidal shaped area larger than an average city block. It was in use during the campaign, and some additional graves were moved from outlying sites into it after the war. Private Victor Laidlaw photographed the cemetery in 1915 and made this comment in his diary: Major Quinn buried at Shrapnel Valley Major Hugh Quinn's grave marker (centre)Amongst the burials is that of Major Hugh Quinn, after whom Quinn's Post was named, now the location of Quinn's Post Cemetery. Ironically, Major Quinn is not buried in the cemetery which bears his name. Captain Quinn was in command of C company, 15th Battalion of the First Australian Imperial Force (AIF), and detailed on 29 April 1915 to hold the precarious position which had been established a few days before. He was promoted to major on 1 May but was shot on 29 May whilst reconnoitring in daylight for a counter-attack to expel Turkish troops from positions nearby seized during an assault on the post.

One of the most outstanding Soviet undercover operatives, Bystrolyotov acted in Western Europe in the period between the great wars, recruiting and controlling several important agents in Great Britain, France, Germany, and Italy. His greatest achievement was breaking into the British Foreign Office files years before Kim Philby, as well as procuring diplomatic ciphers of scores of European countries. Despite his personal courage and heroism, he fell victim of Joseph Stalin's purges of the 1930s. Arrested by the NKVD on drummed up charges, he was severely tortured and turned into an invalid. Serving his term, he spent over 16 years in various Gulag camps. There, at great risk to himself, he wrote and smuggled to the outside world his voluminous memoirs, an indictment of Communist Party of the Soviet Union's crimes against humanity. Early life and career He was born to out-of-wedlock parents in the village of Aibory, in the Crimea, Ukraine, to Klavdiya Bystrolyotov, a provincial clergyman‚Äôs daughter. In his memoirs, Bystrolyotov identifies his father as a vice-governor of Saint Petersburg and governor of Vitebsk, Count Alexander Nikolaevich Tolstoy, a brother of Aleksei Tolstoi.Pir bessmertnykh(Feast of the Immortals) (Moscow, 1993), Vol. 2, 238. In their book The Sword and the Shield: The Mitrokhin Archive and the Secret History of the KGB (New York: Basic Books, 1999), Christopher Andrew and Vassili Mitrokhin cite Bystrolyotov‚Äôs claim that his father was a noted Soviet writer Alexey Tolstoy (p. 44). No documents proving his paternity survived. Raised in an impoverished foster family of aristocrats in Saint Petersburg, with the outbreak of the Russian Civil War, Bystrolyotov first was drafted into the White Army but, after its defeat, was recruited as a ‚Äúsleeper‚Äù by the Cheka, the Soviet secret police. He was sent to the West with the flow of Russian refugees and activated after he settled in Prague, Czechoslovakia. Capitalizing on his knowledge of several European languages and his aristocratic upbringing, he operated with ease amid the upper layers of European societies and became one of the ‚ÄúGreat Illegals‚Äù, a squad of outstanding Soviet spies who worked undercover in Western countries between the great wars. With the growing threat of Fascism and Nazism, Bystrolyotov successfully hunted for Italian and German military secrets. He also stole British secrets for the Soviets years before Kim Philby and made Stalin privy to the contents of French, Italian, Swiss, and American diplomatic pouches. The modus operandi of this dashing young man involved seduction and recruitment of women as Soviet agents, among them a French diplomat, a German countess, and a Gestapo officer. As a result, he provided Stalin with minutes of Hitler‚Äôs meetings with Western diplomats, as well with German, Italian, and Spanish diplomatic codes along with codes of Great Britain and France. Bystrolyotov also procured for the Soviets Hitler‚Äôs four-year plan for the rearmament of Germany and helped identify the Nazis‚Äô fifth column in pre-World War II France. In 1935 he smuggled samples of the latest models of German and Italian weaponry across European borders. During a mission to probe the feasibility of the French government's secret promise to Stalin, in the event of German aggression in Europe, to bring an army of mercenaries from Africa, he twice crossed the Sahara Desert and the jungles of the Belgian Congo.For a short description of Bystrolyotov‚Äôs career, see Nigel West and Oleg Tsarev, The Crown Jewels (New Haven, CT: Yale University Press, 1999), 63-88. Arrest and imprisonment In 1937, at the height of Stalin‚Äôs purges, he was recalled to the Soviet Union and soon arrested and tortured until he ‚Äúconfessed‚Äù to selling out to the enemy. He was sentenced to twenty years of hard labor. Ostracized and deprived of any means of sustenance as relatives of an ‚Äúenemy of the people‚Äù, his wife and his mother committed suicide. Still in the camps, he overcame difficult circumstances‚Äîhis ruined health and the risk of severe punishment‚Äîto begin writing his eyewitness account of Stalin‚Äôs Gulag. Smuggled to the outside world by his fellow inmates and his second wife, whom he had met and married in the camps, his memoir is comparable to that of Solzhenitsyn. Later life After his release in 1954, a polyglot with nearly 20 languages at his disposal, including Dutch, Turkish, Chinese, and Japanese, he worked at various medical research organizations in Moscow as a translator and medical consultant. Besides being a gifted painter, Bystrolyotov was also a talented novelist, screenwriter, and memoirist. In 1963, journal Azia i Afrika segodnya (Asia and Africa Today) published a series of sketches about his African trips. In 1973, a film titled Chelovek v shtatskom (A Plainclothes Man) based on his script was released. In 1974, journal Nash sovremennik (Our Contemporary) published his short novel Para Bellum, a thinly-disguised account of one of his pre-World War II foreign operations. But not one of his memoirs was published in his lifetime. Bystrolyotov died on May 3, 1975, and was buried at the Khovanskoye Cemetery, Moscow. Currently, he is considered one of the leading heroes of Russian foreign intelligence. His portrait is displayed on the walls of the secret ‚ÄúMemory Room‚Äù at the Russian Foreign Intelligence Service headquarters. On November 21, 2011, the International Spy Museum in Washington, D.C. unveiled an exhibit devoted to him. Notes References *Bystrolyotov D.A.

Klomp was born in the Netherlands and raised in South Australia. He began playing for Sturt in 1973 and was a key contributor to their premierships in 1974 and 1976. He was one of the best players on the ground in the 1976 SANFL Grand Final, kicking 2 goals from centre half forward and creating several more for his teammates with clever handpasses. Klomp was signed by VFL club, Carlton during the summer of 1978/79 and made an immediate impact in his first season with the Blues on the half back flank. He played every game of Carlton's 1979 premiership season, finishing equal 7th in the Brownlow Medal with 13 votes and accumulating 20 possessions in both finals while minding dangerous opponents, Russell Ebert and Rene Kink. He suffered a severe hamstring injury midway through the 1981 season and had to watch Carlton's victorious Grand Final from the sidelines. But he returned the following year to play all but one game of Carlton's 1982 premiership season and was an integral member of the league's stingiest defence. A recurrence of hamstring injuries curtailed Klomp's VFL career. After 84 games at Carlton, he transferred to Footscray in June 1983 where he managed to play just 9 games in his two seasons there. He returned to Adelaide in 1985 where he played another three years with Sturt and retired at the end of the 1987 season after 205 games in the SANFL.

Prometheus Books, 1995. :\\"That is why, to this day we never see anyone converting to Islam unless in terror, or in quest of power, or to avoid heavy taxation, or to escape humiliation, or if taken prisoner, or because of infatuation with a Muslim woman, or for some similar reason. Nor do we see a respected, wealthy, and pious non-Muslim well versed in both his faith and that of Islam, going over to the Islamic faith without some of the aforementioned or similar motives.\\"Ibn Kammuna, Examination of the Three Faiths, trans. Moshe Perlmann (Berkeley and Los Angeles, 1971), pp. 148-49 He goes on to regard Muhammad \\"unoriginal\\" and \\"imperfect\\". :\\"We will not concede that Muhammad added to the knowledge of God and of obedience to him anything more than what was found in the earlier religions.\\"\\"Judaism and World Religions: Encountering Christianity, Islam, and Eastern Traditions\\", by Alan Brill, p.165 :\\"There is no proof that Muhammad attained perfection and the ability to perfect others as claimed.\\" The publication of the book caused rioting in Baghdad, forcing Ibn Kammuna to flee that city in secret and was recorded by the thirteenth century historian Ibn al-Fuwati. :In this year 1284, it became known in Baghdad that the Jew Ibn Kammuna had written a volume in which he displayed impudence in the discussion of the prophecies. God keep us from repeating what he said. The infuriated mob rioted, and massed to attack his house and to kill him. The amir...and a group of high officials rode forth to the Mustansiriya madrassa, and summoned the supreme judge and the law teachers to hold a hearing on the affair. They sought Ibn Kammuna but he was in hiding. That day happened to be a Friday. The supreme judge set out for the prayer service but as the mob blocked him, he returned to the Mustansirya. The amir stepped out to calm the crowds but these showered abuse upon him and accused him of being on the side of Ibn Kammuna, and of defending him. Then, upon the amir‚Äôs order, it was heralded in Baghdad that, early the following morning outside the city wall, lbn Kammuna would be burned. The mob subsided, and no further reference to Ibn Kammuna was made. As for lbn Kammuna, he was put into a leather-covered box and carried to Hilla where his son was then serving as official. There he stayed for a time until he died.

Despite Abberton admitting to shooting Hines, Abberton claimed that he had no choice as Hines was going to rape the girlfriend of Abberton, and kill them both. Abberton's defence was able to establish reasonable doubt of murder and that Hines was a violent man that employed standover tactics and was a rapist.

Abberton was convicted in absentia by Magistrate Linden and fined $533; prosecutors allege that Abberton was tasered three times in the course of the incident, which occurred at the Byron Bay police station, following Abberton handing himself to police following damage to a caravan and a domestic incident.

Biography and surf career Sunny Abberton is the oldest of four boys. The Abberton men were born in the eastern suburbs of Sydney to a heroin addicted mother and her criminal boyfriend (who was not their biological father).Jarratt, Phil. Australia's Hottest 100 Surfing Legends. Hardie Grant Publishing, 2012. Their grandmother, Mavis Abberton a.k.a. \\"Ma\\", opened her beach house to the boys.

Bra Boys: Blood Is Thicker Than Water. Documentary, 2007. With the young men spending all of their time on the beach and in the water, Sunny quickly became a noteworthy surfer. In 1989 the then 16-year-old Sunny competed, and placed fourth, in the Australian Scholastic Titles in Victoria, Australia.Wilcox, Kirk. \\"The Reoubtable Sunny Abberton Can Wait...\\" Australia, 5 January 1989, Late Edition, sec.

Sport. http://www.guardian.co.uk/sport/2008/sep/28/surfing.gang. Their motto: \\"My Brother‚Äôs Keeper\\" was tattooed on the boys, sealing the bond that they had with one another. Years later after a heated argument between Sunny's brother, Koby, and their mother's boyfriend led to Koby getting hit in the head with a baseball bat, Sunny took Koby in to his own home.Minion, Lynne. \\"Brotherhood & Redemption\\". Canberra, Australia, 8 September 2009. With the influence of Sunny and the beach, Koby focused on surfing and quickly became one of the most well-known big wave surfers in the world. The Bra Boys The Bra Boys began with the young boys that had been congregating at Ma's for years. The surf tribe concerned themselves with surfing the best waves and protecting their beach. Although they were a gang, they were a surf gang and surfing took priority over violence. The Bra Boys maintained a rough relationship with the authorities and other gangs in the area. The Bra Boys are protective of their home. In 2005, a heated exchange between Australians and Lebanese led to escalating retaliations between the two races. In these Cronulla Riots people were beaten, property was destroyed, and the beaches were made unsafe. Lebanese attacked Maroubra in return for the violence in Cronulla. The Maroubra Beach Bra Boys linked with local Pacific Islanders in protecting their beach and creating a peace between Maroubra and Cronulla.Farred, Grant. \\"Foreigners Among Citizens\\", no. 67. Cultural Critique (2007): 141‚Äì159. The Bra Boys Documentary and Controversy Sunny Abberton was once a professional surfer, who has since become a documentary filmmaker. Abberton's film made history in Australia as being the highest-grossing documentary. Bra Boys, released in 2007, is a film about the surfing gang Bra Boys from Maroubra, New South Wales.Beirne, Rebecca, and James E. Bennett.

Alyssa Roenigk. \\"My Brother‚Äôs Keeper\\", 8 April 2008. http://sports.espn.go.com/espn/print?id=3336614&type;=story. The documentary touches on a variety of subjects: Australia history, crime, violence, and surfing. The film is told from the co-founders of the Bra Boys, the Abberton brothers‚Äô, perspective. The documentary was created as the Abberton's way of telling their story without unreliable media intrusions. Documenting his life as a Bra Boy has raised many questions and debates over both his film and his life. Many believe that the Bra Boys are misinterpreted. Others believe that he is leaving critical parts out of the film in order to create an image of Maroubra as a bad area that hardens those who are raised within its boundary lines. While these critics disagree with Sunny Abberton's portrayal, there are still many who do side with him. These people agree that Maroubra can be a violent place, and the Bra Boys exist to help protect the beach.

The arms of Leycester are a known contravention of the heraldic \\"Rule of tincture\\"Encyclopaedia Britannica, 1902, 9th and 10th editions, \\"Heraldry\\" & www.heraldica.org Sir Peter Leycester, 1st Baronet (also known as Sir Peter Leicester) (3 March 1614 ‚Äì 11 October 1678) was an English antiquarian and historian. He was involved in the English Civil War on the royalist side and was subsequently made a baronet. He later compiled one of the earliest histories of the county of Cheshire and as a result of this became involved in a controversy with the Mainwaring family. He developed a library in his home at Tabley Old Hall and made improvements to the house and estate, including building a private chapel in the grounds of the house. He was an active and conscientious justice of the peace, and used his position on the Bench to expound his staunchly conservative and Royalist political views. Biography Peter Leycester was born at Nether Tabley, near Knutsford, Cheshire, England, the eldest son of Peter Leycester (1588‚Äì1647) and Elizabeth Mainwaring, a daughter of Sir Randle Mainwaring of Over Peover, Cheshire. He entered Brasenose College, Oxford in 1629 as a gentleman commoner but did not take a degree. In 1632 he was admitted to Gray's Inn. When the Civil War started he was appointed as one of the king's commissioners of array for Cheshire. He was in Oxford in June 1646 when the city surrendered to Thomas Fairfax. Consequently, he was excluded from other responsibilities and had time to develop his interest in antiquarian research. Among the subjects he studied was the pedigree of the Mainwaring family. In 1649 he purchased a transcript of the section of the Domesday book relating to Cheshire. In 1655 he had a period of imprisonment, but following the Restoration he was released and returned to the bench as a justice of the peace. In this capacity, according to a modern historian, he harangued grand juries with warnings on the constant dangers of sedition and revolution, and the need to maintain a vigilant watch on all Roman Catholics, especially Jesuits, as well as republicans, Puritans and anyone who threatened the existing social order.Kenyon, J.P. The Stuart Constitution 2nd Edition Cambridge University Press 1986 pp.443, 458, quoting his address to the grand jury at Nether Knutsford in October 1677 He was created a baronet in 1660 as a reward for his loyalty to the royalist cause. Historical antiquities His major historical work appeared in 1673, its full title being Historical antiquities in two books; the first treating in general of Great Britain and Ireland; the second containing particular remarks concerning Cheshire, and chiefly of the Bucklow hundred. Whereunto is annexed a transcript of Domesday-Book, so far as it concerneth Cheshire; it is usually referred to with the shorter title of Historical antiquities. In the book Leycester presented a discussion relating to the legitimacy of Amicia, the wife of Ralph Mainwaring, as to whether or not she was the lawful daughter of Earl Hugh Cyveliok.Quoted in Ormerod, i: 28‚Äì33. This led to a dispute with Sir Thomas Mainwaring of Peover, one of her descendants, who in 1673 published a Defence of Amicia. Leycester replied later that year with An Answer to the Book of Sir Thomas Manwaringe. After this there followed a paper war of 15 pamphlets. In 1675 the justices itinerant at Chester assizes declared in favour of Amicia's legitimacy. Personal life Leycester made a large collection of books and manuscripts in his library at Tabley, compiling a catalogue of 1,332 books in 1672. He produced a musical treatise entitled Prolegomena historica de musica P. L. and a theological dissertation On the soul of man. On his estate he made major improvements, including building a private chapel in his garden between 1675 and 1678. Leycester also assembled a manuscript titled Lessons for the Lyra Viol. It consists of over 100 works for solo lyra viol. Many of the works appear in other collections. One work has an associated date of 1670. The preface to this manuscript includes pages discussing the history of music. In 1642 he married Elizabeth Gerard, the third daughter of Gilbert, 2nd Baron Gerard of Gerards Bromley and his first wife Elizabeth Dutton, at Dutton, Cheshire. They had three sons and three daughters. He died at his home in 1678 and was buried at Great Budworth, Cheshire. His memorial is in the north chapel of St Mary and All Saints Church, Great Budworth. He was succeeded in the baronetage by his eldest son, Sir Robert Leicester (1643‚Äì84).Ormerod, i: 626.

Education in Liberia was severely affected by the First Liberian Civil War and Second Liberian Civil War, between 1989 and 2003. In 2010, the literacy rate of Liberia was estimated at 60.8% (64.80% for males and 56.8% for females). Aid to Basic Education, the amount of bilateral and multilateral aid contributed or received by Liberia (source: UNESCO) Education in Liberia is free for primary students attending a government school, but most of these schools lack adequate learning facilities. Most Parents preferred sending their kids to private schools which are often very expensive for the average Liberian. The country operates on a 6-3-3 system. Primary education The Liberia Primary School Certificate Examination is coordinated in government-funded schools (and many private schools) by the West African Examinations Council. Secondary education Secondary school examinations in government-funded schools (and many private schools) are coordinated by the West African Examinations Council. These are the Liberia Junior High School Certificate Examination, the Liberia Senior High School Certificate Examination and the West African Senior School Certificate Examination. Higher education Historically, from 1862 to the outbreak of the war in the 1980s, higher education in the country centered on: * Liberia College, the precursor to the University of Liberia * Cuttington Collegiate College, the precursor to Cuttington University College * Harper Technical College (founded in 1971), renamed William V. S. Tubman College of Technology in 1978, now known as Tubman University. Currently higher education in Liberia is decentralized. Higher education is provided by a number of public and private universities. The University of Liberia is the country's largest and oldest university. Located in Monrovia, the university opened in 1862 and today has six colleges, including a medical school and the nation's only law school, the Louis Arthur Grimes School of Law. In 2009, Tubman University in Harper, Maryland County became the second public university in Liberia. Cuttington University, established by the Episcopal Church of the USA in 1889 in Suakoko, Bong County, is the nation's oldest private university. Since 2006, the government has also opened community colleges in Buchanan, Sanniquellie, Voinjama, and many other County headquarters. In addition to the above-named colleges, there also exist: * African Methodist Episcopal University * Don Bosco Technical College * United Methodist University (UMU) * African Methodist Episcopal Zion University (AMEZU) * African Bible College University (ABCU) * Liberia International Christian College (LICC) These universities are greatly contributing to the higher education needs in Liberia. They have produced students that are working with international organizations such as the UN, international banking institutions, government and other local institutions. Some are pursuing graduate degrees abroad due to limited graduate programs in the country. For example, while there is an undergraduate program in sociology at all of these universities, there is no graduate program for students wanting to pursue a graduate degree in sociology. The following are disciplines in which undergraduate degrees are being offered: Sociology, geology, political science, history, biology, chemistry, economics. accounting, management, education, journalism, civil engineering, physics, mathematics, English, geography, social work, nursing, architectural engineering, rural development, laboratory technology, theology, general science, and agriculture. Some of these disciplines are only being offered at a single university. For example, Social Work is only being offered as a degree at the United Methodist University (UMU) and Mother Patern College of Health Sciences, which falls under Don Bosco Polytechnic. The University of Liberia offers graduate degrees in education, regional planning, international relations and public administration, while Cuttington University is offering graduate degrees in education, Public Health, Business administration, Management, Public administration, and nursing education. The additional colleges do not have no graduate programs. Liberia has three public Rural Teacher Training Institutes in Webbo, Kakata, and Zorzor.

Its plot follows a group of female finishing school students and their boyfriends being murdered during a Christmas party by a psychopath dressed as Santa Claus. Plot During Christmas vacation at the rural Calvin Finishing School For Girls, a student is killed when she is accidentally pushed over a balcony during a prank. Two years later, on the Friday before Christmas, the school is emptying out for the holiday; however, five students ‚Äî Nancy, Melody, Leia, Trisha, and Sam ‚Äî decide for various reasons to remain at the school, planning to have a weekend get-together with their respective boyfriends. That night, while the remaining girls have dinner, their classmate Cynthia and her boyfriend are murdered outside the school by an assailant with a hunting knife. The others meanwhile coerce the innocent Nancy into giving their housemother, Mrs. Jensen, milk laced with sedatives to make her fall asleep. After she falls asleep, the girls go to a nearby airstrip to meet their boyfriends, T.J, Alex, Tom, and Blake, who have flown in on a private plane. At the house, the group sit in the living room and talk. Trisha goes to the kitchen to retrieve beer, but is confronted by someone in a Santa Claus suit and mask, who slits her throat. When Trisha does not return, Tom goes to find her. He is confronted by the killer, who chases him outside and smashes his head with a rock. The killer buries each body in the school's garden. Later, Sam and Blake have sex in the parlor. They are interrupted by the killer, disguised in a decorative suit of armor, who shoots Blake with a crossbow and decapitates Sam with an axe. Meanwhile, Nancy runs into the school's groundskeeper, Ralph, who ominously tells her he believes something evil is about to happen. Melody, meanwhile, seduces Alex in her bedroom and gives him a handjob. The next morning, Nancy finds Ralph's corpse in the woods outside. A detective, Polansky, investigates the murder, and suggests the students remain sequestered inside for the remainder of the weekend. He also surmises that those missing may be victims of the killer, or possibly perpetrators in Ralph's death. That night, Jim, a police officer stationed outside the school, is murdered by the killer with an axe. Inside, Leia seduces another officer named Dan before going to take a shower. In the bathroom, she finds Sam's severed head hanging from the shower head. Dan rushes into the bathroom, but is stabbed to death from behind as he enters the doorway. Nancy and Alex subsequently come upon the scene, and find Leia suffering a psychotic break, traumatized by what she has witnessed; unable to speak, she begins dancing and humming to herself. Melody and T.J. meanwhile are outside, unaware of what has happened. They kiss under a tree, but the killer, hiding above, strangles T.J. to death with a garrote made of wire. Melody flees inside to find Nancy, Alex, and Leia; the four are confronted by the killer in the Santa outfit, who reveals themselves to be Mrs. Jensen, avenging the death of her daughter who was killed in the prank two years prior. While Mrs. Jensen stalks Nancy through the house, Melody flees back to the airstrip and begs the pilot, sleeping beneath the plane, to take her to safety; the two are killed, however, when an unknown person in the Santa costume starts the engine, slicing them to pieces with the propellor. Back at the school, Nancy is chased by Mrs. Jensen to the balcony. In a struggle, Mrs. Jensen is thrown over to her death. A horrified Nancy goes downstairs, where she is confronted by a second assailant in a Santa costume; it is revealed as Polansky, who explains that he is Mrs. Jensen's husband. Polansky attempts to strangle Nancy, but is killed with a crossbow by Alex. Together, Alex and Nancy flee the school, leaving Leia behind, dancing maniacally on the balcony, singing to herself.  Cast  Release The film was given a limited theatrical release in the United States on January 30, 1980 by Intercontinental Releasing Corporation (IRC). It was released on VHS in the United States by Media Home Entertainment in 1983. Due to the film's poor lighting, many scenes have been hard to see in VHS quality. Scorpion Releasing, under license from current rights holder MGM, released the film for the first time on DVD and Blu-ray on October 21, 2014. Special features include interviews with actors Jennifer Runyon and Katherine Herrington and co-producer and writer Alex Rebar and the original theatrical trailer.  Critical reception  To All a Goodnight was poorly received by critics. AllMovie's Eleanor Mannikka called it an \\"undistinguished, clich√©d slasher film\\". In his book Going to Pieces: The Rise and Fall of the Slasher Film, 1978‚Äì1986, film scholar Adam Rockoff notes the film as \\"borrowing\\" elements from Bob Clark's Black Christmas (1974), including the \\"muted lighting\\" and sets adorned in Christmas decorations, and deemed the film's twist ending ineffective. HorrorTalk.com gave the film a negative review, writing, \\"To All a Good Night is neither a scary movie nor is it truly satisfying either. It is an elusive title that comes with a reputation for establishing the rules of the sub-genre. It is true that Hess and company have lucked into leading the pack of slashers that followed for the next couple of decades. Unfortunately many of these successors handled the material more competently and have left this film behind for many a clear reason.\\" Hysteria Lives! awarded the film 2/5 stars, writing, \\"All-in-all TO ALL A GOOD NIGHT is the kind of slasher movie the Surrealists would have made if they had been around in the early 80‚Äôs; confounding, nonsensical, by turns grindingly dull and startlingly wiggy.\\" Ian Jane from DVD Talk called the film \\"a moderately entertaining low budget horror picture with some fun performances (and some bad ones!) and a decent twist.\\"  References   External links   Category:1980 films Category:American independent films Category:American slasher films Category:1980 horror films Category:1980s slasher films Category:American Christmas films Category:American films Category:Christmas horror films Category:English-language films ","title":"To All a Goodnight"},{"id":"13617910","text":"Vojtƒõch Kuba≈°ta in his home town of Prague Vojtƒõch Kuba≈°ta (1914, in Vienna ‚Äì 1992) was a Czech architect and artist. Vojtƒõch Robert Vladim√≠r Kuba≈°ta was born in Vienna. His family moved to Prague when he was four years old and he lived there his entire life. He demonstrated his artistic talent at the age of four. He had a great desire to become an artist. His father, however, had different goals for his son. He wanted him to study law. Nevertheless, the young Vojtƒõch persisted with his aspiration to become an artist and, eventually, his father agreed that his son could become an architect. The study of architecture, at that time, was considered more of an artistic undertaking than a technical discipline. Some of the great Czech master painters, graphic artists, and illustrators were lecturing at the Polytech University in Prague. Kuba≈°ta graduated with a degree in architecture and civil engineering in 1938. His career as a professional architect was short. From the early 1940s, he worked as a commercial artist, and also as a book designer. His illustrations became increasingly popular. When the communist government nationalised the entire publishing industry in 1948, Kuba≈°ta had to search for new venues to market his artistic talent. He was involved in designing advertising materials for Czechoslovak products abroad. He created three-dimensional cards that advertised porcelain, sewing machines, pencils, Pilsner beer, sunglasses, and other products. Every Christmas season, he designed and illustrated a new cr√®che in which he captured the Czech traditional Christmas setting. In 1956, he designed his first fairy tale pop- up book: Little Red Riding Hood. Kuba≈°ta offered this pop-up book to the Prague-based ARTIA publishing house for publication. ARTIA was a state-owned foreign trade corporation. In 1962, his illustrations were featured in Once Long Ago, a book of 70 fairy tales from around the world. During the years that followed, Vojtƒõch Kuba≈°ta's three-dimensional books made him the publishing house's best-known book designer and illustrator. His pop-up books have been published in 24 different languages and 35 million copies have been sold. Today, original editions of his illustrations and books are sought after by collectors from around the world. The exhibition of his work in the Gallery in the Grove is the first time that Vojtƒõch Kuba≈°ta's original artwork had been viewed by the Canadian public. His magical pop-up books have been displayed in the Toronto Public Library, as a part of Osborne Collection of early children‚Äôs books in April 2002. His books have also been featured on Martha Stewart Living and CBS News Sunday Morning. Kuba≈°ta's first sole retrospective exhibition in North America was organized by the Bienes Museum of the Modern BookPop-ups, Illustrated Books, and Graphic Designs of Czech Artist and Paper Engineer, Vojtech Kuba≈°ta (1914-1992) in Fort Lauderdale, Florida in February 2005. During a recent exhibition of pop-ups and movable books in Chicago in September 2006, Columbia College devoted its entire gallery to Vojtƒõch Kuba≈°ta's art. The city of Prague sponsored an exhibition of his work in December, 2006.

Cosenza was expelled from professional league on 31 July. =Cagliari Calcio= After officially joining the Sardinian club in July 2003, he became a key member of the team for much of the campaign and made 21 first team appearances in the league alone, and helped the team to Serie A promotion for the 2004‚Äì05 Serie A season. He did not appear much for the club, in his first Serie A season, and made his Serie A debut on 27 February 2005, as a starter against Atalanta B.C.. The match ended in a 3‚Äì3 draw. Following his debut, he played in just two more games for the entire season. Following an entire season in Serie A, that saw the left sided defender make just three appearances, he was sold to another island club, Calcio Catania, ahead of the 2005‚Äì06 Serie B season. With this transfer, his first Serie A experience was very short-lived. =Calcio Catania= Calcio Catania officially announced the co-ownership transfer on 7 July 2005, and the player was imminently a part of the rossazzuri's season. He managed to make 23 league appearances, and helped to guide the team to a very impressive second-place finish in the league table, and hence to Serie A promotion. In June 2006 Catania signed Sabato outright from Cagliari for an undisclosed fee. Despite being a part of coach Pasquale Marino's plans during his first season in Sicily, the player was instantly loaned out prior to the new Serie A adventure. He was loaned back into the Italian Serie B, with A.C. Cesena, for the 2006‚Äì07 campaign, for a fee of ‚Ç¨75,000.Calcio Catania S.p.A. bilancio (financial report and accounts) on 30 June 2007, , PDF purchased from Italian C.C.I.A.A. It was a very successful loan spell, however, as the player was a fixture in the team's starting line-up for much of the season, making 32 league appearances, and also netting a goal. Upon his return to Catania, following the expiration of the loan deal, Sabato remained in Sicily for the 2007‚Äì08 Serie A season, under coach Silvio Baldini. Under Baldini, the player was used often, and made 19 appearances in the league, helping guide the team to salvation against relegation for the second consecutive season. Sabato again remained in Catania for the 2008‚Äì09 Serie A season, under another new coach, Walter Zenga. The left back was used just seven times, however in the first portion of the season, and did manage his first Serie A goal, from a free kick, but he was still released as a free agent during the winter transfer market. =Empoli F.C.= On 30 January 2009, Sabato officially joined the second division club, and instantly earned a starting position with the club. In the latter portion of the 2008‚Äì09 Serie B season, alone, Sabato made an impressive 15 appearances. Despite a fairly good start to his adventure with Empoli, the player was surprisingly sold to fellow Serie B club, Triestina, on 14 July 2009. =U.S. Triestina Calcio= With Triestina, the player signed a two-year contract, following his arrival in July 2009. In his first season with the Trieste based club, Sabato was a key figure in the team's starting line-up, and made 33 Serie B appearances during the 2009‚Äì10 season. Despite his efforts, the club failed to avoid relegation, as they lost the play-off match versus Padova, following an 18th-place finish in the league table. =Sorrento Calcio= On 31 January 2011 he was transferred to Sorrento and went on to make 22 appearances.http://www.tuttocalciatori.net/index.php?mod=cc1&stag;=2011-2012‚à•=720&cl;=143&ncl;=SORRENTO CALCIO Outside of football On 5 January 2005, Cagliari retired former club legend Luigi Riva's number 11 jersey to honour him and his achievements with the club; as the last holder of the number 11 shirt, Rocco Sabato presented Riva with his jersey in the club's official ceremony.

The Pact of Forgetting was an attempt to put the past behind them and concentrate on the future of Spain. In making a smooth transition from autocracy to democracy, the pact ensured that there were no prosecutions for persons responsible for mass suffering. On the other hand, Francoist public memorials, such as the mausoleum of the Valley of the Fallen, fell into disuse for official occasions. Also, the celebration of \\"Day of Victory\\" during the Franco era was changed to \\"Armed Forces Day\\" so respect was paid to both Nationalist and Republican parties of the Civil War. The pact underpinned the transition to democracy of the 1970s and ensured that difficult questions about the recent past were suppressed for fear of endangering 'national reconciliation' and the restoration of liberal- democratic freedoms. Responsibility for the Spanish Civil War, and for the repression that followed, was not to be placed upon any particular social or political group. \\"In practice, this presupposed suppressing painful memories derived from the post civil war division of the population into 'victors' and 'vanquished'.Alberto Reig Tapia, Memoria de la guerra civil, Madrid 1999, quoted in The Splintering of Spain, p.9, Cambridge University Press, 2005 While many historians accept that the pact served a purpose at the time of transition, there is more controversy as to whether it should still be adhered to. Paul Preston takes the view that Franco had time to impose his own version of history, which still prevents contemporary Spain from \\"looking upon its recent violent past in an open and honest way\\". Historical background \\"It is estimated that 400,000 people spent time in prisons, camps, or forced labor battalions\\". Some historians believe that the repression committed by the Francoist State was most severe and prevalent in the immediate years after the Spanish Civil War and through the 1940s. During this time of the repression, there was an escalation of torture, illegal detention, and execution. This style of repression remained frequent until the end of the Spanish State. Especially during 1936‚Äì1939, Nationalist Forces seized control of cities and towns in the Franco-led military coup and would hunt down any protesters or those who were labeled as a threat to the government and believed to sympathize with the Republican cause. \\"Waves of these individuals were condemned on mere hearsay without trial, loaded onto trucks, taken to deserted areas outside city boundaries, summarily shot, and buried in mass, shallow graves that began dotting the Spanish countryside in the wake of the advancing Nationalist.\\" Advances in DNA technology gave scope for the identification of the remains of Republicans executed by Franco supporters. The year 2000 saw the foundation of the Association for the Recovery of Historical Memory which grew out of the quest by a sociologist, Emilio Silva-Barrera, to locate and identify the remains of his grandfather, who was shot by Franco's forces in 1936. There have also been some notable references to the Civil War in the arts in recent years (for example, Javier Cercas' novel Soldiers of Salamis). In 2006, two-thirds of Spaniards favored a \\"fresh investigation into the war.\\" Legal basis The pact was given a legal basis in the Spanish 1977 Amnesty Law. The pact was challenged by the socialist government elected in 2004, which under prime minister Jose Luis Rodriguez Zapatero passed the Historical Memory Law. Among other measures, the Historical Memory Law rejected the legitimacy of laws passed and trials conducted by the Francoist regime. The Law repealed some Francoist laws and ordered the removal of remaining symbols of Francoism from public buildings. The Historical Memory Law has been criticised by some on the left (for not going far enough) and also by some on the right (for example, as a form of \\"vengeance\\"). After the Partido Popular took power in 2011 it did not repeal the Historical Memory Law, but it closed the government office dedicated to the exhumation of victims of Francoist repression. The Rajoy government was not willing to spend public money on exhumations in Spain, although the Partido Popular supported the repatriation of the remains of Spanish soldiers who fought in the Blue Division for Hitler. In 2010 there was a judicial controversy pertaining to the 1977 Spanish Amnesty Law. Spanish judge Baltasar Garz√≥n challenged the Pact of Forgetting by saying that those who committed crimes against humanity during the Spanish State are not subject to the amnesty law or statutes of limitation. Relatives of those who were executed or went missing during the Franco regime demanded justice for their loved ones. Some of those who were targeted and buried in mass graves during the Franco regime were teachers, farmers, shop owners, women who did not marry in church and those on the losing side of war. However, the Spanish Supreme Court challenged the investigations by Garz√≥n. They investigated the judge for alleged abuse of power, knowingly violating the amnesty law, following a complaint from Miguel Bernard, the secretary general of a far-right group in Spain called \\"Manos Limpias\\". Bernard had criticized Garz√≥n by saying: Although Garz√≥n was eventually cleared of abuse of power in this instance, the Spanish judiciary upheld the Amnesty Law, discontinuing his investigations into Francoist crimes. International implications The United Nations has repeatedly urged Spain to repeal the amnesty law, for example in 2012, and most recently in 2013. This is on the basis that under international law amnesties do not apply to crimes against humanity. According to the International Covenant on Civil and Political Rights, Article 7, \\"no one shall be subjected to torture or to cruel, inhuman or degrading treatment or punishment\\". Furthermore, Judge Garzon had drawn attention to Article 15, which does not admit political exceptions to punishing individuals for criminal acts. However, this is not a uniform practice, there have been cases where the U.N. said that an amnesty is important in order to restore peace and help make the government stronger. It has also been argued that crimes during the Franco era, or at least those of the Civil War period, were not yet illegal. This is because international law regarding crimes of humanity developed in the aftermath of the Second World War and for crimes prior to that period the principle of nullum crimen sine lege, or \\"no crime without a law\\", could be said to apply.
