It was jointly developed by Israel Aerospace Industries and Elbit Industries. It can be used in either tele-operated or autonomous mode. Both modes do not require human interaction. The more unmanned ground vehicles patrolling the area the less human resources needed while guaranteeing deterrence. The joint program was terminated in April 2016, but the vehicle has remained in service with the Israel Defense Forces. Features The size of the vehicle compared to a person. Guardium is equipped with sufficient armor to protect itself in light fire attacks and against multiple enemies. The vehicle is 2.95 meters long, 1.8 meters wide and 2.2 meters high. It is considered to be a medium-sized combat vehicle, about the size of a Jeep J8; it weighs 1.4 tons and can go up to 80 km/h for up to several days depending on the amount of usage. The vehicle is equipped with: infrared cameras, radars, high-sensitivity microphones, visible sensors, and hostile fire indicators. The equipment was built for unpredicted attacks, but its main purpose is surveillance. The vehicles contain both lethal and non-lethal weapons for protection. It is simple to operate, with stationary, mobile, and portable operational versions. It can be remotely controlled by the mobile command station, where the computers have built in maps. It can also be pre- programmed to drive itself along assigned routes. Powerful sensors can detect unpredicted obstacles and an infrared camera can spot invaders in the dark. When it goes off road, this equipment enables operation in any terrain and weather.  Autonomous Mode  Autonomous robots work with their surroundings and make decisions based on it. The vehicle or robot can work for extended periods of time without human interaction. In this mode it can be set to a certain location or can be put on a ground path and it will cover its designated area until needed or for up to 103 consecutive hours. This mode can sense abnormal circumstances and avoid them. Tele-Operated Mode The tele-operated mode lets the operating team know the Guardium's whereabouts at all times. The vehicle is controlled by the people monitoring its environment. It sends data to the command station letting them know its location, destination, and the view of its surroundings through its rotating camera. It is possible because of the wireless connection built inside the vehicle that transmits the data directly to the server in the command station. Technology=Cameras The main camera is up on top which can rotate a full 360 degrees for full access to the terrain. The cameras can capture thermal images and they have the ability to take videos in certain situations. In cases when the guardium comes across an invader it will record the confrontation for government records and for future access. The cameras have built in auto-target so that it comes to focus when an enemy or object comes in range. They also have back up batteries to in cases where they need to run for 24 hours non-stop.

Life He was a fellow of All Souls' College, Oxford, in 1520.Alumni Oxonienses 1500-1714, Peach-Peyton He devoted himself to civil law, and graduated B.Can.L. on 2 July 1526 and D.Can.L. on 17 February 1527 ‚Äì 1528. In 1529 he became an advocate in Doctors' Commons. He was connected with the diocese of Lichfield, where he held preferments, first under Bishop Geoffrey Blyth, and then under Bishop Rowland Lee. He was made prebendary of Tachbrook in Lichfield Cathedral on 11 April 1531, archdeacon of Salop in April 1536, and archdeacon of Derby on 8 January 1543. He received the appointment of dean of the arches and vicar-general of the archbishop of Canterbury on 14 November 1540. A conscientious adherent of the Roman Catholic faith, he occupied several positions of importance during Queen Mary's reign. In her first year he acted as vicar-general of the bishop of Lichfield, Richard Sampson, and commissioner for the deprivation of married priests, and in his capacity of archdeacon he sat on the commission for the deprivation of Thomas Cranmer, Nicholas Ridley, and Hugh Latimer, and the restoration of Edmund Bonner and other deprived bishops. He stood high in the favour of Cardinal Pole, said to have been a relative, who appointed him his vicar- general. During the vacancy of the see of Lichfield on Bishop Sampson's death in 1554, he was appointed commissary for the diocese. In the early part of the same year he took part in the condemnation of John Hooper and Rowland Taylor. On 25 April 1556 he was appointed on the commission to inquire after heretics, and to proceed against them. On the death of John Chambers, the first bishop of the newly formed diocese of Peterborough, the queen sent letters commendatory to Pope Paul IV in Pole's favour. He was consecrated at Chiswick on 15 August 1557 by Nicholas Heath, archbishop of York. He shortly sanctioned the execution of John Kurde, a Protestant shoemaker, who was burnt at Northampton on 20 September 1557.Foxe, in the 1570 edition of Acts and Monuments (p. 2257) says \\"His name was Iohn kurde a Shomaker, late of the Parish of Syrsam, in Northampton shiere\\" (apparently modern Syresham near Brackley. On the accession of Elizabeth, he was on the first abortive commission for the consecration of Matthew Parker as archbishop, 9 September 1559. In the same year he, with Bonner and two other prelates, signed Archbishop Heath's letter of remonstrance to Elizabeth, begging her to return to the Catholic faith. His refusal to take the oath under the act of supremacy was followed by his deprivation; but he was treated leniently by the queen. Allowed to live on parole in London or its suburbs, he died on one of his farms in May or June 1568. His property he left to his friends, and his books on law and theology to his college, All Souls'.

A light version is also manufactured which can be carried by helicopters and towed behind vehicles such as a HMMWV.  Development  The LAR-160 was designed in the late 1970s by Israel Military Industries, it was adopted by the Israeli Defense Forces in 1983.  Armament  The LAR-160s rocket has undergone continuous development and has resulted in the Mk. I, Mk. II and Mk.IV rockets.  Mk. I Rocket  The Mk. I rocket is 3.4m long and has a diameter of 160mm fueled by solid propellant. The Mk. I is 100 kg and has a 40 kg HE-COFRAM (High Explosive-Controlled Fragmentation) warhead which is activated by an impact fuze or proximity fuze. The Mk. 1 was first used by the Venezuelan Army on an AMX-13 hull.  Mk. II Rocket  The Mk. II rocket weighs 110 kg and has a 46 kg warhead which is either HE-COFRAM or a cluster warhead containing 104 CL-3022-S4 AP/AM submunitions. A remotely set electronic fuze opens the canister at the appropriate height to give area coverage of about 31,400 m2. All 26 rockets can be fired in under 60 seconds and re-loaded in under five minutes from a conventional truck with a 15 t/m crane.  Launcher  Detached LAR-160 multiple rocket launcher The LAR-160 incorporates a modern command, control, communications and intelligence system called ACCS, which has a total interface capability to all common artillery elements including meteorological unit, forward observers as well as mapping, GPS and other items. Elevation and traverse of the launchers are performed by an electrohydraulic system, which is backed up by a manual system. When the system is fitted on a wheeled chassis, two hydraulically operated stabilisers are lowered to the ground to provide a more stable firing platform.  Service history  The system was used extensively by the Georgian Army against Russian and South Ossetian Forces in the 2008 South Ossetia War, systems showed to be extremely effective against Ossetian static targets and large Russian convoys, LAR systems were credited with destroying many Russian trucks and disabling armored vehicles. Romania uses a domestic version of the LAR-160, called LAROM and Argentina uses a domestic version as well called TAM VCLC.

Then in February 1849 he was elected by the second electoral district of Gumbinnen to the first chamber of the Prussian Parliament, which sent him in 1850 to Erfurt, into the Staatenhaus (the chamber of the Erfurt Union parliament that represented the individual states). He was once again elected a member of the Prussian first chamber in the summer of 1850, and joined the moderate right-wing Partei Jordan. In 1851 he became a member of the Landtag of the Province of Prussia, and participated in its session from 1851 to 1852 in Berlin. When the Prussian first chamber became the Prussian House of Lords, the King made him a hereditary member. In 1861 he became the grand-master of the wardrobe at court. He died in April 1874.

He was professor of Science and Technology Policy at the Science Policy Research Unit (SPRU) of the University of Sussex from 1984 to his death. Keith Pavitt Biography Keith Pavitt grew up in Hackney, London. In 1948 he graduated to Hackney Downs School (formerly The Grocers' Company's School). He won an Open Exhibition for Mathematics at Trinity College, Cambridge in the Autumn of 1954.The Review, the magazine of Hackney Downs School, No.177, December 1955 During National Service, he qualified as an RAF pilot. At Cambridge he obtained a First in Engineering in 1959 and was Senior Scholar at Trinity College. He won a fellowship in economics and public policy at Harvard University in 1960-1961. After leaving Harvard, Pavitt began research at the OECD on science and engineering-related public policy. After a year at Princeton University, Pavitt moved to Sussex University in 1971, becoming the Reginald Phillips Professor of Science and Technology Policy in 1984. He received a Laurea Honoris Causa from the Universidad Complutense de Madrid. Contributions to science and technology policy Keith Pavitt pioneered new methods to measure innovation and technical change. Together with Pari Patel and Luc Soete, he developed the use of patents as a science and technology indicator. In the early 1980s, he also developed, together with Joe Townsend and other colleagues, a comprehensive database of innovations introduced in the UK since the end of the war. This database was used by several scholars and it is still a milestone in innovation measurement. Together with Roy Rothwell, he also developed the theory and practice of innovation management. As co-editor of academic journal Research Policy. Policy and management studies of science, technology and innovation,.Research Policy, he contributed to enhance its reputation to become the most influential publication in the field. Pavitt's taxonomy The single most important contribution provided by Pavitt to the economics of innovation is his taxonomy of innovating firms. Pavitt argued that the sources and purposes of innovation are sector-specific. On the ground of an impressive knowledge of industrial innovation, Pavitt's Taxonomy suggests that firms can be divided into four broad categories: supplier dominated firms, i.e. those firms that acquire their technical expertise from their suppliers, specialised suppliers, especially in the field of equipment and capital goods, which provide the innovations to other firms, scale intensive firms, where the innovation is associated to scale, and science-based firms, which innovate through their internal R&D; laboratories. In subsequent versions of his taxonomy, Pavitt added up also the category of information intensive firms, where the most important source to innovate is the use of data. These firms included firms in the software as well as in advanced services such as banking and retailing. Pavitt's Taxonomy has been widely applied in industrial economics and science policy and it is also used for industrial statistics. Originally developed for the manufacturing sector, is now increasingly applied also to the service economy. Legacy Keith Pavitt was a crucial figure, together with his mentor Chris Freeman, to make SPRU a centre of international excellence in the field of innovation studies, with close collaboration with colleagues from all continents. He collaborated closely with Belgian economist Luc Soete, with Italian social scientist Giovanni Dosi, and he kept a strong intellectual link with the American economist Richard R. Nelson. A large number of papers were co-authored with the Indian economist Pari Patel. He also supervised and worked with several economists of innovation and science policy scholars, including Giorgio Sirilli, Ben Martin, Mike Hobday, Ian Miles, Jos√© Molero Zayas, Luigi Orsenigo, Daniele Archibugi, Jan Fagerberg, and Diana Hicks. For his retirement, his colleagues organised a major Conference in honour of Keith Pavitt \\"What do we know about innovation?\\". Unexpectedly, Pavitt died several months before the Conference was held. The Conference became a major tribute to his life and works. The most important scholars in the field of science and technology policy attended it at SPRU, University of Sussex, on 12‚Äì15 November 2003, The Library of the Science Policy Research Unit and the Laboratorio di Economia dell'Innovazione of the University of FlorenceLaboratorio di Economia dell'Innovazione of the University of Florence . are named after him.

A Lynn Medalist in 1984, he was easily the most prominent forward in the 1985 WAFL Grand Final, with six goals, to help East Fremantle defeat Subiaco. The following year, Browning was recruited to Hawthorn but could not break into the team and returned home. Despite being aged 27, Browning was signed by West Coast in 1989 and finally got his chance to play VFL football. He had just eight disposals on debut against North Melbourne but kicked two goals the following round against Brisbane at Carrara. After playing in a loss to Fitzroy, Browning didn't return for five weeks, when he kicked two goals at Subiaco Oval against Collingwood. After being delisted, he continued his WAFL career but mostly in the new role of full-back, a position in which he starred in the 1992 premiership team and won the Simpson Medal.

Legal status The legal status of pornography itself is disputed in Italy. Technically, all production and distribution of pornography in the country is forbidden per Articles 528, 529, and 725 of the Italian Penal Code, which respectively sanction as felonies \\"Obscene publications and shows\\", \\"Obscene activities and objects\\", and \\"Commerce of publications, images or other objects offending public decency\\". In the 1980s, several courts in Italy enforced these laws, ordering confiscation of pornographic material in their jurisdictions. At present, however, the enforcement of such laws is virtually non-existent. A new, more permissive interpretation of the law was introduced in the late 1980s as courts ruled that the Penal Code should be seen as protecting citizens' rights to not be exposed to such materials if and when they don't wish to be. Thus, pornography was not to be considered illegal per se, unless someone were to expose such materials to another against the latter's own will. Notwithstanding these rulings, a small number of towns in Italy have enacted municipal regulations banning sex shops within their boundaries. Providing or exposing pornography to minors under the age of 18 remains strictly forbidden. Other forbidden porn material includes child porn and Snuff porn; contrary to common belief, zoophilia is not illegal, nor is BDSM or fetishism, though other types of acts such as necrophilia are. Most of these extreme practices, though, take place in horror films, which are not covered by statute, rather than strictly pornographic fare. Despite the recent trend toward legalization of porn, distribution of pornographic video materials is almost totally restricted to the home video market. Relevant laws #23 of 6 August 1990 and #203 of 30 May 1995 forbid the broadcast of hardcore pornography on free-to-air television channels, while such is legal on scrambled channels including digital terrestrial television and satellite television. Access to these channels and networks, many of which are pay-per- view, requires a subscription and an IRD, which normally features a parental control function to restrict access to given channels. It remains legal to broadcast erotic/softcore movies, videos and infomercials on unencrypted TV channels from 11 p.m. to 7 a.m. By law, the seller is required to ask for proof of age if he suspects the buyer to be under the legal age for purchasing pornography. This restriction does not apply to certain softcore adult magazines (i.e. Playboy); nevertheless, an unspoken practice of not selling this kind of material to buyers under the age of 16 is observed by Italian news vendors. Pornographic material depicting actors under the age of 18 is classified as child pornography, and is strictly forbidden. Minors cannot give legal consent to appear in pornographic productions of any kind, even though the age of consent in Italy varies from 14 to 16 years.

Kennedy's speech at Ball State University was given on April 4, 1968, in Muncie, Indiana.  Background  On March 16, 1968, Robert F. Kennedy declared his candidacy for president of the United States. On March 28, he flew into Weir Cook Airport in Indianapolis to file as a presidential candidate in the Indiana primary. On April 4, Kennedy made his first campaign speech in Indiana at University of Notre Dame, entitled \\"Feeding America's Hungry.\\" Kennedy then went on to Muncie, Indiana. The landing strip at Delaware County Regional Airport was too small for his campaign's plane, so he had to take a smaller aircraft to Muncie while most of his staff and the accompanying press continued to Indianapolis. Kennedy stepped off of his chartered Convair at 5:40 PM on April 4, about a half an hour behind schedule. He quickly embarked on a red convertible with his wife, Ethel, driving two miles to Ball State University. The Ball State appearance had been arranged by Earl Conn, an assistant professor at the university's journalism department. He was aided by campaign staffer Bill Foley and a local attorney and former 10th District coordinator for John F. Kennedy's presidential campaign, Marshall Hanley. In preparation for the speech Foley had considered using both Emens Auditorium and the men's gym as a venue. Foley was reluctant to use the gym because he was worried it couldn't be adequately filled. Only when he was assured that the second level could be curtained off, did he agree to make use of it.  The speech  The men's gym was completely filled with 10,000-12,000 students, contrary to Foley's initial concerns about a small audience. On stage Kennedy was accompanied by his wife, Delaware County Democratic county chairman Robert Stewart, former vice county chairman Armena Rahe, Mayor Paul Cooley, and Marshall Hanley. After an introduction by Hanley, Kennedy spoke for 34 minutes.  Summary  Kennedy opened with a joke about his brother, Senator Ted Kennedy, supposedly trying to enter the campaign after President Johnson's withdrawal. He proceeded to talk about more serious issues. Kennedy told the audience that with the Vietnam War \\"on the way to being settled,\\" they needed to ask themselves \\"What kind of help and how much should we give to the underdeveloped nations of the world?\\" Concerning domestic poverty, he said \\"What kind of programs can we develop to build a better America here at home for people who live lives of desperation?\\" Kennedy suggested that if America could invest millions in developing a supersonic jet, then it \\"can afford to feed the hungry children of the state of Mississippi.\\" He mentioned how seven out of ten children in Latin America die before their tenth birthday and in Africa many suffered from disease. Kennedy said of them, \\"These men and women and children we hear about and that I'm talking about here, they're not statistics, they are human beings whom I have seen...each with a right to live a life of dignity and purpose just as much as you and I have.\\" Kennedy highlighted the responsibility of the American people for this poverty and for the Vietnam War. Kennedy utilized many fillers and paused frequently during his speech.  Student questions  The senator subsequently spent 21 minutes answering questions presented by the audience. The first of which came from a skeptical student who accused him of \\"telling jokes\\" and \\"double talking\\" without promising any specific solutions. The crowd erupted in boos. Kennedy noted, \\"He's perfectly entitled to disagree with me and that's the only way were going to make progress in this country-if people stand up and speak their minds.\\" Kennedy discussed a potential tax credit program that would encourage businesses to invest in areas suffering from high unemployment. He called the draft \\"inequitable and unfair\\" and opposed student deferrals, instead supporting an impartial lottery system. One of the twenty black students in the auditorium asked, ‚ÄúYour speech implies that you are placing a great deal of faith in white America. Is that faith justified?‚Äù Kennedy answered, ‚ÄúYes‚Äù and added that ‚Äúfaith in Black America is justified, too‚Äù although he said there ‚Äúare extremists on both sides.‚Äù  Aftermath  It has been argued that although the speech has been largely overlooked and ignored, due to the assassination of Martin Luther King Jr., it was one of the most powerful and heartfelt ones Kennedy delivered. From Muncie, the Kennedy entourage flew back to Indianapolis that night where Robert F. Kennedy delivered what many call his greatest speech, announcing the Martin Luther King, Jr. assassination to a predominantly African-American audience. Discarding the themes of his earlier speeches, Kennedy addressed the crowd for six minutes, speaking entirely about King‚Äôs death and its meaning for the nation and the world, ending by asking for prayers for King, his family, and ‚Äúfor our country.‚Äù On May 7, 1968, Kennedy won Indiana‚Äôs Democratic primary with 42% of the vote compared to 31% for Indiana Governor Roger D. Branigin and 27% for Eugene McCarthy. Kennedy‚Äôs trip to Muncie had a positive impact on Delaware County voters, as he received 40% of the votes cast in the county.

History After a long period of producing Italian-inspired softcore comedies in the 1970s, the hardcore film √ñyle Bir Kadƒ±n Ki was distributed in 1979. Many more followed prior to the 1980 coup d'√©tat, when the government strictly prohibited graphic sex in cinema. In the late 1990s, Turkish pornography experienced a minor renaissance, producing cheap, low quality material. Modern producers of Turkish porn are centered in Germany, though they still recruit their performers from Turkey. Legal status Production of pornography is legal in Turkey. However, the Turkish Penal Code imposes some restrictions. In addition to prohibiting child pornography, it also states:Turkish Penal Code > 226/4: Any person who produces audio-visual or written material containing > sexual intercourse by using violence, or with animals, or body of a dead > person, or performed in an unnatural manner; or engages in import, sale, > transportation, storage of these materials or presents such material to > other's use, is punished with imprisonment from one year to four years. Courts have interpreted the unnatural manner clause broadly, sometimes including oral sex and anal sex in that definition.Yargƒ±tay‚Äôdan 'doƒüal olmayan ili≈üki' g√∂r√ºnt√ºlerine hapis istemi The article 226/7 provides exemptions for scientific works; and with the exception of child pornography, to works that have literary or artistic value. Further, regarding the broadcasting of pornographic materials, the Turkish Penal Code states: > 226/2:A person who broadcasts or publishes obscene images, printed or audio > material or who acts as an intermediary for this purpose shall be sentenced > to imprisonment for a term of six months to three years. In May 2006, the government banned the four erotic television channels available on the only Turkish satellite provider, Digiturk. The channels were: Playboy TV, Exotica TV, Adult Channel, and Rouge TV. The ban was instituted by the Radio and Television High Council, on grounds that such programming violated Turkey's cultural values.Turkish government bans porn channels CBC. 6 May 2006. On 9 August 2008, Edibe Sozen, an AKP MP, introduced a bill to ban the sales of pornographic images to anyone under the age of 16. The proposed bill also included a provision that anyone over 16 purchasing such materials would be registered in a database via a Citizen Identification Number. The bill did not become a law. Around 2007, all pornographic websites are blocked by the Turkish government.

Biography Frank Harvey was born Harvey Ainsworth Hilton, in 1883 in Earls Court, London, his father was John Ainsworth Hilton and mother was Elizabeth Hilton. His occupation in the British 1911 Census was \\"actor\\" and was married with Grace Hilton, n√©e Ackerman. He had 3 sisters, called Maria, Cora and Caroline according to British 1891 Census. Caroline Gladys Hilton was married to Hanns Wyldeck and from that union was born in 1914 Harvey Martin Wyldeck also an actor who died in England 1989. He was the cousin to Frank Harvey, Harvey Ainsworth Hilton's son from Grace Hilton. Martin Wyldeck's son Christopher Wyldeck also moved to Australia in the 1970s and is a TV director. Harvey's father was also a writer. Early career Harvey studied acting under Sir Herbert Beerbohm Tree and played Shakespearean parts in the Lyceum Theatre in London. In 1914 he was engaged by J. C. Williamson to play in Australia with Nancye Stewart, and did not return to Britain until 1926.Canberra Times Thursday 17 March 1927 In 1922 and 1923 he played the leading man in a number of J & N Tait productions with the Em√©lie Polini troupe and toured Australia and New Zealand. When Harvey returned to Britain, it took him several months to re-establish himself there, but was cast in The Transit of Venus and then had little difficulty finding work, being particularly well regarded for a role in Jew Suss. Acting in this saw him have a nervous breakdown and he was ordered to take three months off. Harvey also had two plays produced, The Last Enemy and Cape Forlorn. Return to Australia By 1931 he was back in Melbourne to appear in a series of plays for J.C. Williamson, including On the Spot and a production of his own Cape Forlorn.Melbourne Argus Monday 5 January 1931 Harvey said he preferred working on stage to screen: > An actor on the screen is not an actor at all, but a robot. In the days of > the silent films, an actor could have a distinct screen personality; but now > that speech has come, all that is ended. After the novelty has worn off, > talking films will settle down here, as they have abroad, into a mere > substitute for the silent films, and will not interfere in any way with the > prosperity of the legitimate theatre. The screen should stick to the sphere > in which it is really capable ‚Äì the sphere of spectacular production, such > as Iies outside the ambit of the legitimate stage. It is really a glorified > sideshow. Harvey returned to London in October 1931, but was back in Australia in 1933 to work for F. W. Thring at Efftee Productions as an actor and screenwriter. In 1935 he moved to Sydney and began writing and acting for ABC radio. This involvement later led to full-time appointment as senior drama producer in 1944, directing such stars as Queenie Ashton (in early episodes of Blue Hills), Lyndall Barbour and Nigel Lovell. Older Australians may remember him as Nestor the story-teller in the Argonauts Club for most of the '40s.The Golden Age of the Argonauts Rob Johnson, Hodder & Stoughton 1997 His play False Colours was staged by Doris Fitton's Independent Theatre.\\"False Colours ‚Äì New Play by Frank Harvey\\" Sydney Morning Herald 27 May 1935 In 1936 he founded a school of voice production and dramatic art with Claude Flemming. Cinesound That year Harvey also went to work for Ken G. Hall at Cinesound Productions as a studio dialogue director and in-house screenwriter. Starting with It Isn't Done (1937), Harvey wrote or co-wrote nine produced feature film scripts for Cinesound over the next four years, often playing small roles in them as well. According to one observer, Harvey's work as an actor and writer showed his bias towards the theatrical: \\"his scripts tend towards fulsome dialogues with witty repartee and epigram-matical statements, and his acting, particularly in Tall Timbers (1937), tends to exploit dramatic gestures and facial expressions far more intensively than was then required for screen 'naturalism'. Under Hall's direction, Harvey's dialogues were simplified and images allowed to express more of the script's content; his acting too became increasingly restrained as he adjusted to the demands of the film medium.\\" Radio During World War II, Harvey served in the Volunteer Defence Corps until 1944, when he left the army and went under contract to ABC as a radio actor and producer. He eventually became ABC's head of radio drama. By the time Harvey retired in 1952 he had directed many hundreds of radio plays. He was appreciated by actors for his wit and communication skills.

Village Savalde Village Savalde village is situated around 5 km away from Shahada and around 1 km west from Maharashtra State Highway Number 1 on Shahada-Dhule road. It is situated just 1 km away from the official state border between Gujarat and Maharashtra. Many houses in this border village are built on a single mountain on the bank of river Tapti. Occupation of almost all the villagers is farming or related work. For important shopping, health treatment or higher education villagers go to Shahada or Prakasha which are easily accessible by bus, private vehicle or stopping any on route to Shahada passenger riksha on Highway. Fresh vegetables and milk in Shahada town comes from villages like Savalde. It is just 1 km away from the state border between Gujarat and Maharashtra and is slowly becoming an important point to enter Maharashtra from Gujarat. Seismograph station Sardar Sarovar Narmada Nigam Ltd Seismograph Station Office Signboard At Savalde Near Shahada Sardar Sarovar Narmada Nigam Ltd Seismograph Station Office At Savalde Near Shahada Sardar Sarovar Narmada Nigam Ltd has installed 9 seismograph stations around Sardar Sarovar Dam to monitor any seismic activity due to water in dam. These stations are Alirajpur Badwani Kooksi in Madhya Pradesh, Sagbara Ghabana Jeetgarh Kwant Naswadi in Gujarat and Shahada in Maharashtra. Out of these 9 seismograph stations around Sardar sarovar dam, only two seismograph stations, Shahada and Sagbara, are fully functional. Shahada is one of these 9 Seismograph Stations. As seismograph machines are installed away from ground vehicle traffic, seismograph machine is installed in the west direction of Savalde village, just outside the village. Seismograph station at Savalde was also worn out and was not in working condition until 10 November 2006 Savalde earthquake. 10 November 2006 earthquake In the night of 10 November 2006, Savalde villagers reported to Shahada Police Station sounds coming from underground and ground vibrations. After verification, police vans alerted people in Shahada town and nearby villages to remain alert. Nothing happened in the night of 10 November. But in the afternoon of next day, tremors of magnitude 2.8 struck to Shahada tahsil region. No damage done to property or any life anywhere except cracks on the walls of few houses in Savalde village. Scientists from GSDA(Groundwater Surveys and Development Agency) and MERI (Maharashtra Engineering Research Institute) Nasik visited the Savalde village and concluded that underground sounds and tremors occurred because of pressure of weak lithosphere on air pockets in natural or human made cavities inside lithosphere. Due to heavy rain in August 2006, pressure over weak lithosphere mantle increased. Weak lithosphere mantle crashed in this cavity and hence on air inside cavity which caused underground sounds and tremors.

The English translation by Beatrice M. Hinkle appeared in 1916 under the full title of Psychology of the Unconscious: a study of the transformations and symbolisms of the libido, a contribution to the history of the evolution of thought (London: Kegan Paul Trench Trubner). Hinkle's translation was reissued in 1992 as supplementary volume B to The Collected Works of C. G. Jung. In 1952 Jung published a thoroughly revised version of the work, which was translated into English in 1956 as Symbols of Transformation, reissued as volume five of the Collected Works. The book illustrates a theoretical divergence between Jung and Freud on the nature of the libido, and its publication led to a break in the friendship between the two men, both stating that the other was unable to admit he could possibly be wrong.  Overview  According to Jung, his work is an \\"extended commentary on a practical analysis of the prodromal stages of schizophrenia.\\"Jung, Carl G. [1956] 1967. Symbols of Transformation, Collected Works 5. Princeton, NJ: Princeton University Press. . p. xxv. The analysis is of the Miller Fantasies; the fantasies of Miss Frank Miller, an American woman Jung did not know, but whose writings he had encountered in the work of Th√©odore Flournoy. Jung wrote in his 1924 edition of the book that Miller's unusual name was a \\"pseudonym,\\" which it was not. Miller, named for her father, was an Alabama-born performer and lecturer who often gave \\"speeches\\" in character as various cultural and historical figures. She published a few of her most vivid historic fantasies, with her own comments and impressions, in 1905 with an introduction by Flournoy. Jung explains their crucially significant mythological content and portending influence, declaring that Miller exhibited signs of \\"prodromal\\" stages of schizophrenia, and predicting that she would eventually suffer a schizophrenic breakdown. Jung was wrong; although Miller would indeed later receive psychiatric treatment, it was not for a diagnosis of schizophrenia. The Miller Fantasies are included as an appendix in Symbols of Transformation. Jung would later acknowledge that in closely delving into the Miller Fantasies, he was in fact‚Äîwithout admitting it to himself‚Äîtrying to analyze the same critical questions about his own psyche.

The culture of Latin America and French America has traditionally been strongly influenced by the Roman Catholic Church, which tends to be socially conservative. Pornography is least restricted and essentially legal in those countries where the Catholic church is politically and socially the weakest, such as Brazil, Colombia, Argentina, and Mexico. The viewing of pornography in the region has been popularized by the Internet and DVDs. Pornography between consenting adults is legal in many American countries including Colombia La revoluci√≥n del porno decente and Uruguay. Polic√≠a crea unidad de ciberpatrullaje  Bahamas  The Bahamian penal code prohibits the production and distribution of obscene publications. Many types of pornography are prohibited in the Bahamas, however law enforcement is relaxed and does not usually enforce the prohibition. Pornography is available on Bahamian cable television and in 2014 ZNS-TV broadcast a report on the establishment of a local pornography industry in the Bahamas.  Brazil  In Brazil, pornographic film actors must be 18 or older. Pornography which does not involve bestiality is legal when sold in public places. Depiction of sex with animals is legal. However, magazine and DVD covers that depict genitalia must not be visible from public view, and pornography can only be sold to people 18 or older.  Canada  The laws of Canada permit the sale of hardcore pornography to anyone over the age of eighteen. While persons below that age may have pornography in their possession, its sale to them is prohibited. Most hardcore pornography is sold in adult stores or on adult websites.  Chile  Chile's pornography industry began in the 1950s and grew significantly until the 1973 Chilean coup d'√©tat. Under the subsequent military dictatorship of Chile the industry was suppressed. Following the Chilean transition to democracy and the development of the Internet, the pornography industry in the country has begun to expand again.  Colombia  Colombia has become a big hub for live web cam streams and has seen a rise in camgirls as a result of the increase in access to the internet. Almost 98% of \\"latin\\" models come from Colombia while only 2% come from Mexico and Brazil.  Cuba  Pornography is illegal in Cuba, however the laws were relaxed in the 2010s.  United States  In the United States, courts have repeatedly confirmed that obscenity is not legal in the United States; it is not entitled to the freedom of the press protection contained in the First Amendment to the United States Constitution. Pornography has become semi-legal, then in practice legal, because it has been \\"shown\\" not to be obscene. The Miller test, developed in the 1973 case Miller v. California,Text of the decision and dissents, from findlaw.com was used for some years to define material as pornographic but not obscene. It has three parts: * Whether \\"the average person, applying contemporary community standards\\", would find that the work, taken as a whole, appeals to the prurient interest, * Whether the work depicts or describes, in a patently offensive way, sexual conduct specifically defined by applicable state law, * Whether the work, taken as a whole, lacks serious literary, artistic, political, or scientific value.This is also known as the (S)LAPS test‚Äî[Serious] Literary, Artistic, Political, Scientific. The work is considered obscene only if all three conditions are satisfied. Local areas are permitted to develop their own laws on the issue, as long as they do not conflict with federal law. Pornography is a large industry that involves major entertainment companies, which offer pornography films through cable channels and in-room movies in hotels. Pornography distribution changed radically during the 1980s, with VHS and cable television largely displacing X-rated theaters. VHS distribution, in turn, has been replaced by DVD and Internet distribution for niche markets. Pornography generates billions of dollars in sales in the United States alone.

Announced as part of the 2003 First Ministers' Accord on Health Care Renewal with a mandate to report publicly to Canadians, the Health Council provided a system-wide perspective on health care reform related to the 2003 Accord‚Äôs policy and program commitments as well as those contained in the 2004 10-Year Plan to Strengthen Health Care. In 2010, the Health Council‚Äôs mandate was expanded to include the nationwide dissemination of information on best practices and innovation in health care.  History  Created in 2003, the Health Council of Canada produced more than 60 reports on a variety of health care themes, such as Aboriginal health, access and wait times, health promotion, health system performance, home and community care, pharmaceuticals management, and primary health care. The work of the Health Council of Canada was funded by Health Canada, overseen by 13 independent councillors and one ex-officio councillor appointed by the federal, provincial, and territorial governments (excluding the Government of Quebec), and supported by a professional secretariat based in Toronto. In addition to its reports, the Health Council of Canada assessed and highlighted innovations that were contributing to a higher-quality health care system in a searchable database called the Health Innovation Portal. Launched in November 2012, the portal featured practices, policies, programs and services that could be scaled up or adopted elsewhere in Canada, ideally to improve health outcomes in the most cost-effective manner possible. Notable features of the portal included a searchable database with more than 400 innovative practices covering a range of health care themes, a user-friendly search function, and customizable outputs for health policy researchers. The Health Council also hosted national symposia, roundtables and town halls on critical health care topics such as system sustainability, health human resources, integrated care, patient engagement, and quality improvement. It continually engaged key stakeholders on important health policy issues in its work, online and through its social media channels. The Health Council was also an active contributor to the online Evidence Network for health care journalists and researchers as well as McMaster University‚Äôs Evidence-Informed Healthcare Renewal (EIHR) portal. In April 2013, the federal government announced that its funding for the Health Council of Canada would end after March 2014. According to the federal government, with the end of the accords in 2014, the Health Council had completed its mandate.

That year, the country legalized pornographic literature. Subsequently in 1969, it became the first nation in the world to legalize pictorial and audiovisual pornography.Denmark in the International Encyclopedia of Sexuality - \\"...Denmark was the first country in the world to legitimize written pornography in 1967 (followed by pictorial pornography in 1969).\\". People in Denmark have had free access to it ever since. There still are a few regulations: for example, pornography must be placed out of the eyesight of children, and it may not be sold to persons under the age of 15. The public TV channel Kanal K√∏benhavn broadcast hardcore pornography free and uncoded at night, in the early 2000s. Prior to 2015 there were no specific restrictions against animal pornography and such affairs came under animal cruelty laws. If no harm or pain has been inflicted on the animal, such acts are not illegal. This changed in late April 2015, when Denmark passed a new law, making sex with animals illegal. This lack of legislation has allegedly made Denmark a center for the production of animal pornography. This accusation, however, was dismissed as a myth by Det Dyreetiske R√•d, a legal council, which in November 2006 published an extensive report on the topic of animal sex.Udtalelse om menneskers seksuelle omgang med dyr Det Dyreetiske R√•d Since 1980, child pornography has been illegal in Denmark.Section 234 of the Danish Criminal Code (1969), reads whoever 'sells indecent pictures or objects to a person under 16 yrs of age' is to be punished by a fine. Section 235 (1980) has a special provision concerning the reproduction and sale of child pornography, that is, sexually explicit photographs of persons who appear to be under 15 years (the taking of such pictures was always a criminal offence). It is illegal to distribute photographic or video pornography of persons under the age of 18, although the age of consent in Denmark is 15.

She spent her 31-year career as lumber hooker, towing schooner barges on the Great Lakes. She sank in 1919, in a Lake Superior November gale. All of her 17 crew members were killed but her captain survived. He was found drifting on wreckage near Ile Parisienne. Her tow, the Miztec, survived. Myron defied the adage that Lake Superior \\"seldom gives up her dead\\" when all 17 crewmembers were found frozen to death wearing their life jackets. Local residents chopped eight of Myrons sailors from the ice on the shore of Whitefish Bay and buried them at the Mission Hill Cemetery in Bay Mills Township, Michigan. Myrons steering wheel, steam whistle, and many other artifacts were illegally removed from her wreck site in the 1980s by members of the Great Lakes Shipwreck Historical Society. Her artifacts are now the property of the State of Michigan and are on display as a loan to the Great Lakes Shipwreck Museum. The wreck of Myron is protected as part of an underwater museum in the Whitefish Point Underwater Preserve. History The wooden steamer Myron was built as a lumber hooker in 1888 in Grand Haven, Michigan. She was originally named Mark Hopkins for the son of Captain Harris Baker, the first of a series of owners. Her name was changed to Myron in 1902.Thunder Bay National Marine Sanctuary Vessel Datatbase. Myron suffered several major mishaps and rebuilds during her 31-year career on the Great Lakes. She was sunk by Vanderbilt on 27 September 1895, in Hay Lake, near Sault Ste. Marie, Michigan. She was raised 19 October 1895, and rebuilt in Marine City, Michigan in 1896. She was released after she ran ashore on Long Point on Lake Erie in 1901. She was rebuilt again from 1903-1904 in Bay City, Michigan.Thunder Bay National Marine Sanctuary Vessel Database. Myron averaged 12 trips a year at the end of her career Stonehouse, p. 30. and she sailed under the flag of O.W. Blodgett Lumber Company, considered the last of the big lumber companies on the Great Lakes.Oleszewski, p. 175. As a lumber hooker, Myron was designed to tow one or two barges and to carry her own deck load to pay her way. She towed big, old converted schooners stripped of their masts and running gear to carry large cargoes.Boyer, pp. 139 - 140. The schooner barge Miztec was the last of Myrons many consorts when she foundered.Gerred, p. 3. Final voyage Myron departed Munising, Michigan on Lake Superior bound for Buffalo, New York shortly before dawn on 22 November 1919, towing Miztec. Both vessels were piled high with lumber. A crew of 18 was aboard Myron and 7 manned Miztec.Stonehouse, p. 174. Two hours after departure from Munising, a severe November gale struck Myron and Miztec with northwest winds blowing , a rapidly dropping temperature, and heavy snow.Kohl, p. 428. When the pounding seas opened the wooden seams on the aged Myron, her pumps could not keep up with below deck water.Wolf, p. 163. Ice build up on Myron changed her center of gravity and made her unstable in the heavy seas.Boyer, pp. 140 - 141. Her engine could not keep up with the accumulation of water and ice until she was reduced to a speed of . Captain Walter Neal, of Myron, decided to drop Miztec off near Vermilion Point before he attempted to fight their way to the shelter of Whitefish Bay. The battered Miztec dropped her anchors, swung her bow to the seas, and survived the storm. When the larger, steel steamer Adriatic came upon the struggling Myron, she ran alongside Myron and provided shelter from the smashing waves in the long battle to reach Whitefish Bay. The lookout at the Vermilion Life-saving Station gave the alert when he spotted the laboring Myron shadowed by Adriatic. Captain McGaw and his Vermilion crew launched their motor powered surf boat in the raging surf and followed Myron.Stonehouse, p. 175. Myron came to within of Whitefish Point when the rising water below deck extinguished her boiler fires. She slipped into a deadly trough and sank to the bottom of Lake Superior within 4 minutes. Although her crew launched her 2 lifeboats, they were trapped by the surrounding sea boiling with wreckage and lumber. The pilothouse of Myron blew off as she sank with Captain Neal still inside. He climbed out the window and clung to the roof.Stonehouse, pp. 175 - 176. Rescue efforts Gravesite of sailors from the S.S. Myron at Mission Hill Cemetery Adriatic stayed with Myron to her end and twice tried to break through the mass of debris to save the castaways but was forced to pull away to avoid foundering after touching bottom with both rescue attempts.Stonehouse, p. 176. Captain Lawrence of the H.P. McIntosh decided to try rescuing Myrons crew after he witnessed Adriatics failed attempts. He forced his steel steamer through the wreckage field to come close enough to throw lines to Myrons crew but they were so numbed by the frigid temperature, they could not grasp the lines with their frozen hands. Captain Lawrence had to pull away for open water to avoid H.P. McIntoshs destruction by the mountainous waves in the shallow water. The Vermilion lifesaving crew arrived at the wreck site after a wild trip but they could not reach Myrons crewmen without smashing their small boat in the mass of floating lumber. Captain McGaw calculated that the survivor's lifeboats would be swept down into Whitefish Bay so he rounded Whitefish Point and went in pitch darkness and heavy seas to Ile Parisienne but found nothing. Lighthouse keeper Robert Carlson reported that the exhausted Vermilion crew arrived at the Whitefish Point dock cut and bleeding from the beating they took by the heavy seas.Wolf, p. 163 Twenty hours after Myrons sinking, Captain Jordon of the steamer W.C. Franz was upbound out of the Soo Locks and on the lookout for survivors when he sighted a body moving on wreckage near Ile Parisienne. Captain Jordon launched a lifeboat and rescued a half-dead Captain Neal from the roof of Myrons pilothouse. Captain Neal's clothing was frozen to his body and his hands were so swollen that 2 finger rings were not visible but he survived.Wolff, p. 164.Oleszewski, p. 172. The rescue of Captain Neal gave hope that others from Myron survived. United States Coast Guard submarine chaser number 438 left Sault Ste. Marie with a double crew searching for survivors but was unsuccessful. Three days after the sinking, a Kingston, Ontario, newspaper cited a Lake Superior adage when it declared, \\"... Little hope is held out, however that Myron bodies would wash ashore, unless lashed to wreckage, as the cold lake waters prevent forming of gases, and, it is claimed bodies seldom rise to the surface. It is traditional that 'Lake Superior seldom gives up her dead.'\\" Kohl, p. 430. All 17 crewmen of Myron drowned or froze to death in Whitefish Bay. All were recovered wearing life jackets and covered with ice. A tug owned by Frank Weston found a boat load of frozen crewmen in Whitefish Bay several days after the sinking. Some crewmen were frozen into grotesque shapes that had to be thawed out next to a roaring fire at a Sault Ste. Marie funeral home. The bodies of five of the crewman were found encased in ice near Whitefish Point in November 1919, but further search for the lost crew was hampered by a heavy snow and sleet storm.Staff Author Local residents found eight bodies of Myrons crew frozen in the ice near Salt Point on Whitefish Bay the next spring. Dave Parrish and Jay Johnston chopped the sailors from the ice and Simon Johnston buried them in rough boxes made at Evans mill. The sailors rest at the pine covered Mission Hill Cemetery in Bay Mills Township, Michigan overlooking Iroquois Point and Whitefish Bay. Their graves are enclosed by a white fence with a signboard \\"Sailors of the Steamer Myron\\" attached to it. A large stern section of Myron washed ashore on the Canadian side of Whitefish Bay.Kohl, p. 429. All the lumber on the two vessels was lost. Myron carried of lumber and Miztec carried of lumber. The lumber washed ashore for days west of Whitefish Point and in Whitefish Bay, enough lumber to build two small towns.Boyer, pp. 143 - 144. The 31-year-old Myron was valued at $45,000. Criminal charges In press interviews, Myrons Captain Neal leveled criminal charges against the captains of Adriatic and H.P. McIntosh that prompted an investigation of many months by United States marine inspectors.Stonehouse, p. 177. At a special Steamboat Inspection Service hearing, Captain Neal stated: > I was clinging to the roof of the pilothouse when the McIntosh hailed me > shortly after the Myron went down from under me. The McIntosh drew alongside > me, not more than away. Although it was dusk, the ship was so close that I > had no difficulty in making out her name. I talked to the captain and > expected that he would put out a yawl and pick me up. He did not do so, nor > attempt in any way to help me. 'I will have a boat sent for you,' the > captain of the McIntosh called. And he drew away. I have never seen him > since, nor do I ever want to see him by the great hokey, pokey. The Steamboat Inspection Service revoked the licenses of the masters of Adriatic and H.P. McIntosh for life. The marine community considered the verdict a gross injustice against the masters who risked their lives, their crews, and their vessels in efforts to rescue Myron in the treacherous shallows off Whitefish Point. It is probable that the verdict was reversed but there are no available records to confirm this. Wreck history John Steele and Tom Farnquist (Executive Director of the Great Lakes Shipwreck Historical Society (GLSHS)) discovered Myrons wreck in 1972, in of water, about from Whitefish Point, at Harrington, p. 327.Shumbarger, p. 7. Steel and Farnquist salvaged the anchor from Myron and donated it to the Museum Ship Valley Camp in Sault Ste. Marie, Michigan.Kohl, p. 432. The GLSHS later positively identified the wreck in 1982, when they salvaged the builder's plate and other artifacts from Myron for display in the Great Lakes Shipwreck Museum at Whitefish Point. Michigan's Antiquities Act of 1980 prohibited the removal of artifacts from shipwrecks on the Great Lakes bottomlands. The Evening News reported a Michigan Department of Natural Resources and Environment 1992 raid on the Great Lakes Shipwreck Museum and its offices that found evidence of 150 artifacts illegally removed from the state-claimed bottomlands, including artifacts from Myron.Storey, p. A1. Following a settlement agreement with the GLSHS, an axe, double sheave block, signs, a valve, steering wheel, steam whistle, lumber hook, open-end wrenches, a soup bowl, an oiler, and a block pulley from Myron are now the property of the State of Michigan. Myrons artifacts are on loan to the GLSHS for display in the Great Lakes Shipwreck Museum. Myrons remains are shattered by surf and ice but she is a popular site for scuba divers. Her bow sits upright draped with anchor chains. A large windlass lies just off her bow. The boiler and engine sit off her port side, a metal capstan is on the stern, most of her midsection is disintegrated, the keel is mostly buried, and the enormous, four-bladed propeller sits upright.Harrington, p. 328. Myrons wreck site is protected for future generations of scuba divers by the Whitefish Point Underwater Preserve as part of an underwater museum. Divers who visit the wreck sites are expected to observe preservation laws and \\"take nothing but pictures and leave nothing but bubbles\\".Michigan Department of Environmental Quality Great Lakes diver Harrington cautions that \\"divers must be certain of their abilities and equipment\\" when diving the Whitefish Point Underwater Preserve. Miztec sank in 1921, and came to rest near her longtime campanion, Myron, to be together forever.Harrington, pp. 321 - 322.Wolf, p.170.

An Athabascan village that was established on the shores of Lake Clark in the Alaska Range, its population was recorded at 91 in the 1880 United States Census and declined thereafter, falling to approximately 25 individuals by 1904. Today, the village has been abandoned. The ghost town is located within the bounds of Lake Clark National Park and Preserve. The historic portion of the village was the subject of archaeological and ethnological research in the 1960s. Interviews with Dena'ina elders in Nondalton established that the people of Kijik relocated to Old Nondalton (not far from present-day Nondalton) in the early 19th century, probably to be closer to trading posts and the canneries of Bristol Bay. A survey expedition that visited the site in 1909 reported it to be abandoned. A major archaeological excavation of the historic village took place in 1966, exposing twelve foundational remnants of log houses (many of the houses having apparently been moved to Old Nondalton at the time of the relocation), and two of what appeared to be larger communal structures. In 1979, twelve acres of the village site were added to the National Register of Historic Places as a historic district. A much larger area, encompassing a significant number of archaeological sites related to the habitation and use of the area from at least the 12th century forward, was designated a National Historic Landmark District in 1994, for the unique concentration of sites related to the inland Dena'ina people. The community was known by many other names than \\"Kijik\\" during its history, including \\"Lake Clark Village\\", \\"Nijik\\", \\"Nikhkak\\", \\"Nikhak\\", and \\"Old Keegik\\". Its current name has been spelled in a wide variety of ways, including \\"Keechik\\", \\"Keeghik\\", \\"Keejik\\", \\"Keggik\\", \\"Keygik\\", \\"Kichak\\", \\"Kichik\\", \\"Kilchik\\", and \\"Kilchikh\\".

The airport supports general aviation, with no commercial airline service available. It is primarily a business and jet charter airport. History Haguenau Airport was built in 1916 by the German military to train World War I fighter and bomber pilots.History . ‚Äì Haguenau Aeroclub. This made it a military target, and it suffered its first bombardment on 2 September 1918. In the run up to World War II it was in use as a civil airport. It was also used in the 1930s by the French Air Force as a liaison and courier airfield, due to its proximity to Fort 16 (S.F. de Haguenau) of the Maginot Line, but it did not at this time have any combat units assigned to it. German use during World War II The airport was seized by the German Wehrmacht during the 1940 Battle of France, being renamed \\"Hagenau\\". The Luftwaffe, however, did not use the airport for several years. In 1943, a construction program was begun to improve the facilities, laying down two concrete runways (07/25 and 03/21) along with a support area, hangars, and various maintenance shops. Finally in September 1943, Luftlandegeschwader 2 (Airborne Squadron 2) (LLG 2) moved in with Heinkel He 111 medium bombers, being used as tow planes for Gotha Go 242 transport gliders. The glider units remained until June 1944. The Luftwaffe, 1933‚Äì45 In the spring of 1944, as a result of the Luftwaffe going on a defensive footing as part of the \\"Defense of the Reich\\" campaign, Nachtjagdgeschwader 5 (NJG 5) in April and Nachtjagdgeschwader 6 (NJG 6) in May moved to Hagenau, equipped with Messerschmitt Bf 110 night interceptor fighters equipped with radar to attack the Royal Air Force heavy bomber fleets attacking targets in Germany. In October, the night fighters moved out; no further Luftwaffe units are documented at this airfield. In several publications was stated that II/JG6 was located there between October and December 1944 but it seems that they were located at Hagenow, an airfield close to Schwerin in Northern Germany. Haguenau became a major target of USAAF Ninth Air Force B-26 Marauder medium bombers and P-47 Thunderbolts mostly with 500-pound general-purpose bombs; unguided rockets and .50 caliber machine gun sweeps to attack the German interceptors on the ground. The attacks were timed to have the maximum effect possible to keep the interceptors pinned down on the ground and be unable to attack the heavy bombers. Also the P-51 Mustang fighter-escort groups of Eighth Air Force would drop down on their return to England and attack the base with a fighter sweep and attack any target of opportunity to be found at the airfield.Derived from information in USAAF Film \\"Target For Today\\" (available at https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kkGL7vuC2A4) American use The Haguenau area was the scene of heavy fighting between Allied ground forces and the Wehrmacht in late 1944 and early 1945. The airport was liberated in mid-December 1944. Once cleared of enemy forces, the USAAF IX Engineering Command 826th Engineer Aviation Battalion began clearing the airport of mines and destroyed Luftwaffe aircraft, and repairing operational facilities for use by American aircraft. By 20 December the airfield was declared ready for Allied use and was designated as Advanced Landing Ground \\"Y-39 Haguenau\\".IX Engineering Command ETO Airfields General Construction Information The airfield was immediately put to use as a Resupply and Casualty evacuation (S&E;) airfield to support the combat units in the area and move combat wounded back to hospitals in the rear area. The airfield was briefly evacuated due to heavy fighting in the area and it being shelled by German artillery during late December and early January, however it was secured and put back into operation by mid January.Johnson, David C. (1988), U.S. Army Air Forces Continental Airfields (ETO), D-Day to V-E Day; Research Division, USAF Historical Research Center, Maxwell AFB, Alabama. In early April 1945, the only operational combat unit used Haguenau, that being the Ninth Air Force 69th Reconnaissance Group, which provided Third Army with aerial photography over forward areas in Germany with a variety of reconnaissance aircraft. The unit remained until the end of the war, pulling out on 30 June 1945.Maurer, Maurer. Air Force Combat Units of World War II. Maxwell AFB, Alabama: Office of Air Force History, 1983. . With the end of the war, Haguenau Airport was returned to French control on 17 July 1945. Postwar/Civil use The city of Haguenau was seriously damaged by the World War II battles in the city and around the area. The airport, being no exception, was largely in ruins. After many years of being abandoned while other, more pressing reconstruction took place, the entire facility was torn down as simply being unrepairable. A completely new airport was laid out and built over the ruins of the old airfield, slightly to the east of the former facility. Today, Haguenau Airport is a modern, well-equipped civil airport used primarily for charter flights. A grass airfield supports light general aviation and gliders, and has a small restaurant. The wartime facility is evident to the west of the airport, with an industrial estate being built over a large area of the former airfield. The outlines of both concrete runways are evident over the grassy area of the facility, with one large concrete section of the former 25 end of the northeast/southwest runway remaining. Three large patched bomb craters can be seen on the relic, as well as numerous bomb craters on the grass area to the west of the current airport. What appear to be concrete pads of large aircraft hangars are visible in a wooded area, along with the remains of a large aircraft parking area to the west of the airfield; the concrete deteriorating and the expansion joints filled with grass as they separate the various concrete pads.

He was the last doge before the suppression of the Genoese state and the only one elected twice, a unique case in the history of that Republic for the biennial election doges.  Life as the Doge of the Republic = First term  The coronation ceremony was celebrated on 13 September 1779 inside the Church of Santi Ambrogio and Andrea, as the hall of the Grand Council of the Palazzo Ducale was not accessible due to the fire of 1777, and the subsequent reconstruction work. The first term of the Doge Brignole was marked by a violent smallpox epidemic which quickly spread throughout the Republican territory and from the numerous incursions of Barbary pirates along the coasts of Liguria. A fortunate expedition against the raiders, arranged by Gerolamo Durazzo, brother-in-law of Brignole, allowed the captain Giovanni De Marchi to kidnap several Xebecs and to capture more than fifty prisoners in the waters in front of Bordighera. The doge ceased on March 4, 1781, the former Doge entered in the junta of the Borders and then in that of the Jurisdiction; from 1788 to 1796 he was the headmaster of the state inquisitors and in this capacity he managed to approve, at the end of 1790, a new stricter regulation of censorship.  Second term  In a climate now surreal and close to decline, Giacomo Maria Brignole was elected on November 17, 1796 once again a Genoese doge, a unique fact in the secular history of the Republic of Genoa. For the difficult moment he refused any kind of celebration and the consequent coronation ceremony. With Napoleon increasingly at the western gates of the Republic of Genoa, the policy of Doge Brignole was based entirely on the neutrality of the Genoese state which did not want and should not join the Austro-Sardinia coalition against France. The situation began to precipitate for the customs government with the increasingly victorious Napoleonic battles and which inevitably sparked the first \\"followers\\" among the noble representatives and among the Genoese people. The same representative of France residing in Genoa, Guillaume-Charles Faipoult, had direct orders from Napoleon to follow events in the capital of the republic. In May 1797, arrests of some Jacobin rioters followed, which caused unrest in the city and in fact now divided the minds of the Genoese in favor or against the ever-growing Napoleonic power. The doge's son Gian Carlo Brignole also participated in the clashes with the Genoese Jacobins. Now pressured by troops from across the Alps, he agreed with the senators to send an embassy to Bonaparte, who negotiated the establishment of a provisional government headed by the same doge Giacomo Maria Brignole on June 14, 1797, with the aim to draft a democratic constitution.  Under Napoleon's rule  In a Republic of Genoa almost canceled by the Napoleonic events, the figure of the ex doge Brignole was chosen as the representative of a provisional government of the newly constituted Ligurian Republic, whose power was concentrated in the role of the doge and twelve senators, as well as various representatives pro-French and pro-Bonapartist nobility. A title that of doge which was however abolished on June 17 of the same year - after the observations made by the lawyer Gaetano Marr√© of Borzonasca to the Municipality and to the doge himself - and replaced with the correct and revised role for Brignole as \\"president of provisional government \\"of the Ligurian Republic. He still maintained this role of representative of a \\" puppet and pro-Napoleonic state\\", with increasing embarrassment and absenting himself whenever possible, until January 17, 1798 when a Directory took over.  Later years  In August 1798 some important people of the former Republic of Genoa, defined \\"dangerous individuals\\", were removed from the borders of the state and among these were Brignole, Stefano Rivarola, the brothers Girolamo and Giovanni Battista Serra and the Jacobean marquis Gaspare Sauli. Of the group, the two Serra brothers moved to Milan, Giacomo Maria Brignole and Gaspare Sauli to Florence and Stefano Rivarola to his Chiavariese lands. He took up residence at the convent of San Paolino in Florence where he died on 21 December 1801.  Personal life  Brignole married Barbara Durazzo, with whom he had six children. The eldest son Gian Carlo was finance minister of the Kingdom of Sardinia from 1816 to 1824. The Palazzo Gio Carlo Brignole in Genoa was his property until 1798.

There has been a shift in the mode of determining whether a material is obscene or not with the R v. Butler judgment. The obscenity laws were challenged as violative of freedom of expression in R. v Butler. Obscenity is defined as follows under the Criminal Code: \\"the undue exploitation of sex or of sex and one or more of the following subjects; namely, crime, horror, cruelty and violence.\\" The court held that the term ‚Äúundue‚Äù should be interpreted on the degree of harm which flows from such exposure that predisposes people to act in an anti-social manner. The court ruled that pornography is harmful if it contains violence or explicit sex which is degrading or dehumanizing and which creates a substantial risk of harm, as it harms a person's right to be equal. Therefore, there is a shift from the community standard's test to the harm test post the Butler judgment. Science A 2009 study at the University of Montreal did not find any men, among the 20 men they interviewed, in their 20s who claimed to have never viewed pornography. Sale of hardcore pornography The sale of hardcore pornography is illegal in Canada to anyone under the age of 18 (19 in some provinces), but anyone above that age may own or possess pornography. Distribution Most pornography is sold in adult stores, on adult websites or convenience stores. No specific laws control distribution of pornography. The Canada Border Services Agency is empowered to stop the importation of materials prohibited under obscenity laws. Many gay and lesbian bookstores have claimed that this is applied in a discriminatory manner against same-sex pornographic material. Television stations Conversely, some over-the-air television stations (particularly Citytv and TQS) often broadcast softcore pornographic films after midnight. Hardcore films also air on MX excess, one of the seven multiplex channels operated by The Movie Network. In addition, pornographic films may be publicly shown (to those above the age of 18) and advertised, as is the case in some stores on Yonge Street in Toronto and rue Sainte-Catherine in Montr√©al.

The province's capital was Venice. In the course of the French Italian campaign of 1796, the Signoria of Venice under Doge Ludovico Manin had rejected an alliance with Napoleon, whereupon Bonaparte occupied the city on 14 May 1797, leading to the Fall of the Republic of Venice. In turn for renouncing all rights to the Southern Netherlands and the recognition of the French Cisalpine Republic, Emperor Francis II of Habsburg gained the conquered Venetian territory including the Dalmatian coast, except for the Ionian Islands.Treaty of Campo Formio (extracts) Replacing the long lasting Republic of Venice, this new Province of Venice was incorporated as a separate part of the Austrian archduchy, where Francis took the additional title of a \\"Duke of Venice\\", it was however not subject to the Holy Roman Empire. The province was directed by an Austrian governor, but continued to use former Venetian legislation and maintained its currency, the Venetian lira. The western border of the province was shifted in favour of the Cisalpine Republic by the 1801 Treaty of Lun√©ville, and drawn up along the thalweg of the lower Adige river. Treaty of Lun√©ville Unlike the previous 1,100-year-old republic, the province did not have a long existence. After the Grande Arm√©e had defeated the forces of the Austrian Empire at Austerlitz, Francis according to the 1805 Treaty of Pressburg had to cede the Venetian territory to the Napoleonic Kingdom of Italy.

Note the secondary burn chamber below the fire box where the wood gases are ignited. Insulated underground line is run from the boiler to the building. The outdoor wood boiler is a variant of the classic wood stove adapted for set-up outdoors while still transferring the heat to interior buildings. Technology The outdoor wood boiler is a variant on the indoor wood, oil or gas boiler. An outdoor wood boiler or outdoor wood stove is a unit about 4-6 feet wide and around 10 feet long. It is made up of four main parts- the firebox, which can be either round or square, the water jacket, the heat exchanger, and the weather proof housing. The fire box ranges from 2 to 5 feet long and can be as tall as 4 feet. The firebox and heat exchanger are surrounded by water or a glycol-water solution, which absorb heat from the burning wood. The heated water is generally circulated through insulated underground lines to a heating load, where the heat can be transferred from the water to various heat emitters. Standard outdoor wood furnaces Standard outdoor wood boilers heat the firebox and the smoke goes out the exhaust straight. If not run hot enough, the exhaust gas will be thick and black, and the resulting ash will not be fully rendered. While functional, these models take more work and are far less efficient than some newer more efficient models. Catalytic outdoor wood boilers Some newer outdoor wood boilers have a catalytic converter installed, to allow for a more efficient burn and treatment of the exhaust before it leaves the unit. There is a considerable difference in cost between these and standard units. These are far less popular than gasification outdoor wood boilers. Secondary combustion (gasification) outdoor wood boilers How a gasification outdoor wood boiler works. Gasifier wood boilers use secondary combustion air to burn additional wood gases. The most sophisticated systems use computer controls to direct air at different stages of the burn process at variable volume. High efficiency outdoor wood boilers use down draft gasification must meet strict EPA Phase 2 Certification. Outdoor wood gasification boilers can burn between 30% - 50% less fuel than its traditional counterpart. Outdoor wood boilers are a topic of environmental controversy. An improperly used or built outdoor wood boiler can produce wood smoke with excessive unburned particulate matter, but when properly burned, studies show that burning wood is still one of the most environmentally friendly heating options. In 2007, EPA began a voluntary program to encourage manufacturers to reduce particulate levels. In 2015, the U.S. EPA updated its clean air standards for residential wood heaters, this is a mandatory standard for sales in the United States. The revised regulations apply only to new products and will not affect existing wood heaters. At this point, the only boilers that pass these emission controls are gasification models.http://www.epa.gov/residential-wood-heaters/fact-sheet-summary- requirements-wood-fired-hydronic-heaters References * * Category:Boilers Category:Heaters Category:Residential heating Category:Residential heating appliances Category:Stoves Category:Furnaces ","title":"Outdoor wood-fired boiler"},{"id":"24582890","text":"Vaipoa is one of three villages on the island of Niuatoputapu in Tonga.\\"ENVIRONMENTAL IMPACT ASSESSMENT\\" The World Bank.

The community was established in 1964 and has been based in its present location since 1967. The sanctuary has been refurbished in light wood and glass to reflect the Hebrew name of the community, Beit Or, House of Light. Mati Kirschenbaum was appointed in 2020 as the community's Rabbi.  Affiliation and staff  Bromley Reform Synagogue is a member of the Movement for Reform Judaism.  Services  Services are held every Shabbat on Friday evening and Saturday morning as well as for all Jewish festivals. Services are egalitarian; men and women sit together and take an equal role in the religious life of the community. Family services are held regularly through the year and are normal Shabbat services but are shorter (one hour) with much participation, less formality, storytelling rather than a haftarah, songs and no sermon. Services are led by the Rabbi or lay readers, using the standard Reform liturgy. There are also other services, mainly on Friday nights, when the format differs, and there is a great deal of opportunity for participation by lay members, many of whom also lead services when the rabbi is absent.  Community  The synagogue has an inclusive approach to Judaism and all sorts of people are involved in the community including born Jews with varying degrees of Jewish knowledge, people considering conversion or actively engaged in study for conversion, mixed- faith families and people who have lost contact with their Judaism and are looking for a way back. Member profiles: \\"Getting to know us\\" A wide range of events and activities are organised ‚Äì youth, education, social, religious and local area groups which organise social events in their own neighbourhoods. There is a social centre for older people with coffee and socialising, board and card games, gentle physical exercises and a discussion on a topical issue followed by lunch and a talk or entertainment. There are also some special interest groups and the rabbi sometimes gives talks and lecture series.  Education  There is a strong emphasis on families learning together and the synagogue has a cheder (religion school) for children aged 5‚Äì14 where they study Hebrew and learn about Judaism. There is also a thriving gan yeladim (kindergarten) on Sunday mornings with activities, food and songs for toddlers and their parents, and facilities for children from birth upwards.  Young people  The community has made funding available for members of its B'nei Mitzvah class to attend Shemesh, the summer camps organised by RSY-Netzer, the Zionist youth movement for Reform Judaism. Young people are also encouraged to participate in Jewish holiday camps and in Europe tours and gap year schemes organised with Israel Experience. They also have the opportunity to join in local youth activities with Maccabi and the Jewish Lads' and Girls' Brigade, among others, and with RSY-Netzer.  Communications  Bromley Reform Synagogue's website was recognised in the 2009 Board of Deputies Media Awards, when it won the prize for best synagogue website.

This protocol covers the application layer in the OSI model of computer networking. The protocol is standardized by International Organization for Standardization as ISO 14230. KWP2000 also covers the session layer in the OSI model, in terms of starting, maintaining and terminating a communications session.  Commonly used physical layers  One underlying physical layer used for KWP2000 is identical to ISO 9141, with bidirectional serial communication on a single line called the K-line. In addition, there is an optional L-line for wakeup. The data rate is between 1.2 and 10.4 kilobaud, and a message may contain up to 255 bytes in the data field. When implemented on a K-line physical layer KWP2000 requires special wakeup sequences: 5-baud wakeup and fast-initialisation. Both of these wakeup methods require timing critical manipulation of the K-line signal. KWP2000 is also compatible on ISO 11898 (Controller Area Network) supporting higher data rates of up to 1 Mbit/s. CAN is becoming an increasingly popular alternative to K-line because the CAN bus is usually present in modern-day vehicles and thus removing the need to install an additional physical cable. Using KWP2000 on CAN with ISO 15765 Transport/Network layers is most common. Also using KWP2000 on CAN does not require the special wakeup functionality. KWP2000 can be implemented on CAN using just the service layer and session layer (no header specifying length, source and target addresses is used and no checksum is used); or using all layers (header and checksum are encapsulated within a CAN frame).

His work is influenced by modern popular musical styles such as rock and electronic, as well as Mexican popular culture. Background Chapela was born in Mexico City where he still lives. Since adolescence, he has been interested in various musical styles including classic rock, jazz, danz√≥n and electronic along with contemporary classical. Chapela received his bachelor's degree in composition from the Centro de Investigaci√≥n y Estudios Musicales (CIEM) and studied classical guitar at the Associated Board of Royal Schools of Music in England. He later received his master's from the University of Paris Saint-Denis in 2008. In addition to his career as a composer, Chapela has also played guitar in a heavy metal band. Career The composer has been commissioned to create works for the Los Angeles Philharmonic (where he was an invited guest in 2008), Dresdner Sinfoniker, Carnegie Hall, Britten Sinfonia, Wigmore Hall, Berkeley Symphony, Orquesta Sinf√≥nica Sim√≥n Bol√≠var, Orquestra Sinf√¥nica de S√£o Paulo, City of Birmingham Symphony, University of Cincinnati's CCM Symphony, Orquesta Sinf√≥nica Carlos Ch√°vez, Entrequatre, Cuarteto Latinoamericano, ONIX Ensemble, New Paths in Music Festival, Vail Music Festival, and the National Center for the Performing Arts (Beijing) . The Festival Internacional Cervantino commissioned Chapela t write Danza de un poeta y el viento for its 2014 edition, played by La Orquesta Mexicana, (an ensemble derived from the Pasatono Orquesta). His first major recording was in 2005 with Antag√≥nica, which was supported by a grand from FONCA:, CIEM and Consecuencias Discogr√°ficas. His work has been recognized since 2002, receiving grants from the John Simon Guggenheim Memorial Foundation Fellowships, National System of Art Creators (FONCA-Mexico) and the International Rostrum of Composers (UNESCO), and individual works has won awards as well. La mengambrea received an honorable mention at the first Anacrusax Saxophone Composition Competition, and Inguesu won first place as the Alexander Zemlinsky Competition at the University of Cincinnati. Chapela's music is exclusively published by Boosey & Hawkes, and has been performed in multiple countries in the Americas, Asias and Europe. Ensembles which has performed his pieces include the Chicago Symphony, Indianapolis Symphony, Saint Paul Chamber Orchestra, Seoul Philharmonic, Warsaw Philharmonic, Brooklyn Philharmonic, Jena Philharmonic, Philharmonic Orchestra of the Americas, Orquesta Sinf√≥nica Nacional de M√©xico, Cabrillo Festival, Tanglewood Festival, Orquesta Sinf√≥nica de Puerto Rico, Metropolis Ensamble, Percussion Group Cincinnati, North/South Chamber Orchestra, Nuevo Ensamble de M√©xico, Ensemble 10/10, Arditti String Quartet, Carpentier String Quartet, Cuarteto Jos√© White, Modern Sax Quartett Berlin, Haags Saxofoonkwartet, Stockholm Sax Quartet, Cosmos Sax Quartet, Case Sax Quartet, Anacrusax, Tambuco, Quinteto de Alientos de la Ciudad de M√©xico, Quinteto de Metales de la Ciudad de M√©xico, Trio de Alientos de Bellas Artes, Gonzalo Salazar, Victor Flores, Mauricio N√°der, √Ålvaro Bitr√°n, Natalia P√©rez Turner & Horacio Franco. Chapela teaches composition and a concept called ‚Äúmatem√∫sica‚Äù (math-music) which uses mathematical principles to create scores. He teaches at his alma mater, CIEM, and is the director of the N√∫cleo Integral de Composici√≥n (NICO) in Mexico City. In 2003, the appeared as himself in the TV documentary En el fondo somos as√≠, and currently hosts a contemporary music radio show called Metamusica which is broadcast by OPUS 94 radio station. Works His influences include John Cage, whose philosophy of composition he admires, along with the works of Carlos Ch√°vez and Silvestre Revueltas. Like other contemporary classical composers of his generation, he has integrated elements from other contemporary musical forms into his work, such as rock and electronic music. One of his early works, La condena, has strong rock influence. He is also influenced by traditional Mexican music. Having studied advanced musical electronics in Paris, he has applied the harmonic concepts of French spectralists to his works. Pieces can have much percussion and elements such as 1950s avant-garde sound effects. Compositions can be for full orchestras, sometimes adding non-traditional instruments such as Ant√°gonica, or for a single instrument. Melate binario is for a single guitar, based on a Mexican lottery game. It is written in two versions, eight pages each. The first vision is dodecaf√≥nica and the other diat√≥nica. The interaction between the two produces 256 distinct compositions. Magnetar was commissioned by the Los Angeles Philharmonic, and is ‚Äúraunchy, orchestral heavy metal.‚Äù The cello is electric and hooked up to a wa-wa pedal. This and another piece have been called ‚Äú‚Ä¶a pretentious mess, but a beguiling one that made many of us want to hear more.‚Äù according to the Los Angeles Times. Chapela believes that any theme can produce and interesting works, although his work is not always accepted, especially when it references Mexican popular culture. The work √çnguesu is based on the final game of the 1999 FIFA Confederations Cup, when Mexico won over Brazil at the Estadio Azteca. He has had some trouble having it played in Mexico because it is considered \\"naco\\" (low-class) especially a short series of notes near the end that reference a common insulting whistle. The composer has also created the scores to the Mexican films, Somos lo que hay, directed by Jorge Michel Grau and Amar no es querer, directed by Guillermo Barba. Both scores have received recognition: the Mexican Film Academy 2011 nomination por best original music for the first and won ‚ÄúBest Original Music Score‚Äù at the ‚ÄúPantalla de Cristal‚Äù film festival.

He assumed the additional surname of Mackintosh by royal licence 1857.Debretts Guide to the House of Commons 1886 He trained as a lawyer and became a councillor in Inverness. He was heavily involved in land and development in the town and was chairman of the Anglo- American Land Mortgage and Agency Co.

As a lawyer, he had access to many rare manuscripts and documents, and these formed the basis for his own published works on Scottish history. In his historical work, Fraser-Mackintosh admitted to a sympathy for the Jacobite cause of \\"Bonnie Prince Charlie,\\" due to being indirectly named after the prince via various Jacobite ancestors. He was a Fellow of the Society of Antiquaries of Scotland.

Initially he was opposed to agrarian unrest, arguing that negative consequences would occur if Scottish Gaels adopted the tactics of the Irish Land League and came to be seen as \\"discontented and disaffected.\\" Later he changed his mind and was returned as the MP for Inverness-shire for the Crofter's Party in 1885. He was returned unopposed in 1886, but opposing Home Rule for Ireland, he joined the Liberal Unionist Party, and lost the support of the local Highland Land League. The League backed Liberal Party candidate Donald MacGregor at the 1892 election, who unseated Fraser-Mackintosh. He was then the only Gaelic-speaking member of the Commons and became known as the 'Member for the Highlands'. One of five members of the Napier Commission, set up in 1883, to investigate the crofters' situation; he was the driving force behind the establishment of the Crofters' Commission and for promoting the use of Gaelic in Highland schools.

Battle The Kalhoran army had hardly had a chance to rest when a camelman brought a letter from M√≠r Fateh Al√≠‚Äôs brother, M√≠r Ghul√°m Al√≠, to their camp. The note informed them that Mi√°n Abdunnab√≠ had advanced as far as L√°dk√°nah with a Bor√≥h√≠ force that had been given to him by Muhammad Nas√≠r, the Kh√°n of Kal√°t. Commanding this force was Abdunnab√≠'s son-in-law Zarak, who had been promised that the M√¨an, when reinstated, would give him 3 lakhs of rupees and a part of his territory; further, the letter stated the army had been joined by Mehr√°b and Dhing√°nah Jat√¥√≠s and by the Jhinjans, Kh√≥sahs, Nuhmard√≠s, and other tribes. When M√≠r Abdull√°h, the commander of the Kalhoran forces, got this news, he immediately ordered his troops in the direction of the enemy, whom he met at the bridge of Ch√°lak. There he halted opposite the enemy‚Äôs camp. M√≠an Abdunnab√≠, believing that the Bal√≥ches had arrived there after a difficult journey, and thus were fatigued, advised his officers to attack immediately. Abdunnab√≠'s forces were then hastily formed into three divisions, the center being led by Abdunnab√≠ himself with forces of Jat√≥√≠s and Kh√≥sahs. Abdunnab√≠'s right wing consisted of Kal√°t√≠s or Br√≥h√≠s under Zarak, as well as the left wing of Nuhmard√≠s. Seeing the advance of the enemy, M√≠r Abdull√°h likewise divided his army into three divisions. He ordered Mian Sadik, who had been brought on an elephant to the battlefield, to engage Abdunnab√≠'s army with M√≠rz√≥ Fak√≠r and his son B√°ghah. M√≠r Fateh Kh√°n, with his force of Niz√°m√°n√≠s, was instructed to engage the Nuhmard√≠s. M√≠r Abdull√°h, together with his cousin M√≠r Fateh Al√≠ Kh√°n on his right and M√≠r Suhr√°b Kh√°n on his left, proceeded to attack the Br√≥h√≠s. After a fierce gun battle, the forces of M√≠r Fateh Kh√°n, himself recovering from a bullet wound sustained in a prior battle with R√°jp√∫t forces, were forced to retreat. At the same time, Abdunnab√≠ gained the upper hand over the column under M√≠an S√°dik Al√≠ and drove it back. Seeing this, M√≠r Abdull√°h and his cousins dismounted and, swords in hand, made a vigorous attack on the center of the enemy. In the resulting confusion, Zarak Br√≥h√≠, Mehrab Jat√≥√≠, and a number of other veteran soldiers were killed. M√≠an Abdunnab√≠'s army then fled in confusion and panic, leaving much booty for the Bal√≥ches. Finally victorious, the M√≠an and the M√≠r returned to Khud√°b√°d.

However, it has been on the drawing board since 1980, and since then Kruger Mpumalanga International Airport has opened and Maputo and Durban airports have been upgraded. There are also environmental concerns since Sikhupe is near Hlane game park, and may put rare species of eagles and vultures at risk. King Mswati III International Airport was planned to replace Matsapha airport by 2010, with the latter being taken over by the army.

Information Recently introduced by the online unit of the New York Times, the \\"surround session\\" is creating a major buzz in the online advertising community. The session model represents a potentially significant shift in the way advertisers view online media, as more emphasis is placed on the real interaction between advertisers and audiences. In a surround session, an advertiser has all or most of the ads on each page for a visitor's entire site visit. As the visitor moves from page to page, the same advertiser is represented in various ad placements. This could allow for reinforcement of an advertiser's message, or possibly the creative use of a story line across several pages. As currently proposed, an advertiser only pays for sessions that reach a predetermined amount of page views, and does not pay for any views in short sessions or the extra views in long sessions. The number of guaranteed page views per session is likely to vary, depending on what buyers are looking to purchase and what publishers are able to deliver. The move to a session-based model might even give new life to beleaguered metrics such as the click-through. Many marketers equate a 1% click-through rate with only 1 in 100 visitors clicking on an advertisement. At best, this assumption is slightly imprecise... at worst, it is grossly inaccurate. For example, assume that a particularly \\"sticky\\" site averages 11 page views per visitor and a 3% click-through rate. This means that up to 33% of the audience could have responded to the advertisement, assuming no duplicate clicks. Perhaps most significantly, the surround session is one of the first advertising ideas in recent times that does not further degrade the user experience. This new method of packaging ads does not require longer download times, more screen space, or annoying browser tricks.

She worked as a servant in a pub or shebeen in the area, owned by William Connors. Kendrigan was sent to Loughrea, with seven shillings and six pence to buy bread, veal, wine and other items. She passed the entrance gates to Dunsandle Castle and reached the bridge over the river at Toolooubaune, about four o clock in the afternoon. There she was met by John Hurley from nearby Bookeen. Hurley was aged about twenty-four, and had also worked for the Connors family before been dismissed a fortnight previously for dishonesty. Men and women working in the area later described hearing screams coming from the direction of the bridge at around that time of day. Constable George Humphries found the body covered with hay, invisible from the bridge but with a great deal of blood around the stones and on the ground. The veal and bread were nearby, and her purse contained a single farthing. It was determined that Kendrigan's death was the result of head injuries, her skull having been fractured by a blow behind the left ear. Her face had cuts and bruises, and a cut was found in the middle of her throat. John Hurley was seen drinking heavily in Loughrea that evening, wearing new clothes, and in the company of prostitutes. He was arrested and arraigned for murder. Witnesses included Bedilia Connors, daughter of William Connors; Margaret Dolan of Bookeen; William Daniel, gardener at Dunsandle; Daniel's boy, 14-year-old John White; Michael Fallon, herder for Dunsandle and his boy, John Connolly; Matilda Callinan of Loughrea; John Fennessy; constable George Humphries of Bookeen; Henry Cloran, MD, of Loughrea.

The play's central theme is of popular culture becoming the inheritor of religious scripture, which anticipated Potter's later serial Pennies from Heaven (1978). The play's title is taken from the song used in The Wizard of Oz, another version of which features in the incidental music. Synopsis Jack Black is a disturbed actor who believes himself to be trapped in a television play, followed around by an invisible camera. Having sought the help of an NHS hospital psychiatrist, Jack explains that although he has recently only been able to find work in television commercials he much prefers them to television plays, which he considers morally corrupting. He goes on to reveal that his sexual disgust drove his wife Judy into having an affair with his agent Colin and that he has lost his faith. Leaving the psychiatrist's surgery he encounters his wife, who persuades him to go somewhere where they can talk. They head to Barnes Common where Jack becomes violent and, convinced the camera is on him again (he acted in a dog food commercial there), decides to disrupt the narrative by running Judy over with her car. In an attempt to restore some 'goodness' into the plot he goes to Colin's flat to see his young wife Veronica, who mistakes his declarations of love as a sexual advance and invites him to seduce her. At an appointment the next day (junior) Doctor Bilson prescribes Jack with some different drugs to alleviate his paranoia. Jack leaves the hospital and climbs into a car with his wife Judy ‚Äì and the whole play ends with \\"Jack's next job (in reality or imagination) ... fronting a presentation\\"W. Stephen Gilbert The Life and Work of Dennis Potter, Woodstock and New York: Overlook Press, 1998, p.202 for his newly prescribed drugs. Principal cast *Denholm Elliott as Jack Black *Billie Whitelaw as Judy Black *Richard Vernon as Doctor Whitman *Bernard Hepton as Colin Sands *Dennis Waterman as Doctor Bilson *Michele Dotrice as Veronica Sands Structure and themes The action of the play is broken up by two mock television commercials for breakfast cereal (\\"Krispy Krunch\\") and dog food (\\"Waggytail Din-Din\\"): both of which feature Denholm Elliott's character Jack Black acting, and justify his claim to the psychiatrist that the adverts present an idealistic and \\"pure\\" world view. As Jack's mental health deteriorates throughout the course of the play, the voiceovers and dialogue featured in these commercials start to form an ironic commentary into his condition. The Krispy Krunch commercial, which originally sees Jack going to the kitchen for a midnight snack, transforms into a recollection of how he stumbled upon his wife in bed with his agent, while extracts from the Waggytail Din-Din advert are intercut with Veronica's misunderstanding of Jack's intention as she invites him to seduce her (\\"Dogs can't live without it!\\"). The play's final turning in on itself as one long commercial for tranquillisersHumphrey Carpenter Dennis Potter: A Biography, London: Faber, 1998 [1999 (pbk)], p.274 sees Jack dressed in a medic's white coat in a television studio, quoting the \\"Epistle of St Paul to the Philippians\\". Potter uses these commercials as a wider metaphor for popular culture becoming an inheritor of scripture; this is a device he explores in several plays, all of which take an essentially religious structure (see below). A major theme of the play is the exploration of individual choice in the face of a seemingly omniscient narrator. Jack appears to be aware of his role as a character within the confines of a television play and comments accordingly on the drama as it progresses. In the opening scene, as he waits for his appointment with the psychiatrist, Jack comments on the \\"shoddy\\" set design and the play's apparent lack of pace (\\"Not much bloody action, is there? [...] People will switch over or switch off\\"); when an elderly patient tries to make polite conversation with him, he chastises her for the banality of her dialogue (\\"You don't get many interesting lines, do you?\\") before acknowledging this is \\"not [her] fault\\" and that she has \\"only got a small part\\". Jack's paranoia about his predicament is intensified by his awareness of the camera, which he frequently addresses, either to demand that it stops following him, or to ridicule the audience (\\"I can picture them now [...] Munching away on their telly snacks, the corrupt zombies\\"). Jack abdicates responsibility for his actions in the early part of the play by surrendering himself to its anonymous, malevolent author ‚Äîwhen he beats his wife Judy during their walk on Barnes Common he immediately apologises by saying that is what the script demanded him to do‚Äî but when he attempts to take over the narrative in the latter part of the drama only then does he begin to realise exactly how powerless he has become until he receives medical intervention. Intertextuality=Other Potter works Potter incorporated several scenes from Follow the Yellow Brick Road into his first novel Hide and Seek (1973), which also features a central protagonist (in this case 'Daniel Miller') who becomes aware of himself as a character in a novel and seeks to liberate himself from the hands of the author. In this work The Author also derides his agent, clearly based on Clive Goodwin, Potter's own agent at this time, in both works.Gilbert, p.203 This theme is also returned to in Double Dare (1976) and Karaoke (1996), both of which feature an author who becomes convinced that their latest works are being played out in front of them and they have been relegated to players in their own drama. The former uses a fictional advert for a chocolate bar, filmed as a pastiche of the 1970s Cadbury's Flake commercials, as a means of demonstrating how far an actress will go in pursuit of her profession, while the latter uses a karaoke club as a metaphor for how human yearning becomes a commodity. Cultural references As a means of underlining Jack's distaste for sex, Potter borrows his character's name from the cobbler in Dylan Thomas' Under Milk Wood (1954); in Thomas' poem, Black finds the sexual habits of the young couples in the eponymous Welsh town disgusting and dreams of frightening them. The references to The Wizard of Oz (both the film and the original book) underline the central theme of both Potter's play and Frank Baum's Oz stories, which are often viewed as satires for \\"glitzy commercialism\\" and the American Dream.Carpenter, p.275 Broadcast and reception The play was first broadcast on BBC 2 on 4 July 1972 and received mixed reviewsCarpenter, p.281 with critics missing the religious theme. Potter biographer Humphrey Carpenter thought that actor Denholm Elliott and director Alan Bridges \\"treated it as light comedy, skating over its psychological agonies\\", but recognised that Potter had \\"reached a peak\\" with this work. It received repeat broadcasts in 1987 (on BBC2) and 2005 (BBC Four) as part of Dennis Potter seasons.

History  The Advertiser had its beginnings in 1847, when printer William Tomlinson of Stodman Street issued the first Newark Monthly Advertiser. It had four pages and cost 1d. In 1854 Tomlinson made his journal a weekly publication, called it the Newark Advertiser and Farmers' Journal, doubled its size to eight pages and trebled the price to 3d. Upon Tomlinson's death his son-in-law Mr Whiles became the sole owner of the Advertiser. In 1874 Cornelius Brown became editor of the Newark Advertiser. Within months of taking the editor's chair, Brown was ready to buy a half-share in the newspaper, for which he paid Mr Whiles ¬£600. The Newark Advertiser Co Ltd was incorporated on 19 September 1882. When Whiles died in 1900, he was succeeded by his son Herbert Whiles. In 1903 J. C. Kew came on to the Advertiser scene in a significant way. He had already been writing for the paper for some years and also ran a coal business at Beaumond Cross. Brown at the age of 51 decided to hand over some of his editorial responsibilities to Kew who was then 35. Cornelius Brown died on 4 November 1907 and Kew became editor. See also *S. S.

Life He was born in Charles County, Maryland in 1872, but came to Washington, DC as a child where he later established his career in architecture. Simmons received his architecture degree at the University of Maryland, and later studied architecture at MIT. He started designing and building houses in the 1890s, before he moved on to bigger commissions. In 1902, the Evening Star described Simmons as \\"an architect who has added to the beauty and growth of this city.\\" His career spanned several decades from the 1880s to the 1930s during which time he established himself as an extremely prolific architect, designing more than 280 buildings in the city. Simmons also worked with every major developer, though he appears to have had a particularly close working relationship with Lester A. Barr and later his son, John L. Barr with whom he designed some of his best known commissions. Simmons was incredibly versatile, designing a variety of building types that ranged from row houses, to fraternal clubs, to commercial and institutional buildings, though he seems to have had a proclivity for apartment buildings, having designed over 60 of them. Of particular note on his resume are his designs for the National Metropolitan Bank Building at 15th and G Streets NW (1905), the Elks Club at 919 H Street NW (1908, demolished); and the Fairfax Hotel at 21st and Massachusetts Avenue NW (1921), in addition to the Wyoming Apartments and the Barr Building. His earlier Hume School, built in 1891, is on the National Register of Historic Places, along with the National Metropolitan Bank Building, the Wyoming Apartments, and the Barr Building. The National Metropolitan Bank Building Although he never studied at the √âcole des Beaux-Arts, B. Stanley Simmons became a student of the Beaux Arts tradition and the City Beautiful Movement. While his earlier 19th-century buildings (namely speculative row houses) reflect Victorian styles of architecture, his later early 20th-century buildings are grander and more monumental structures that reflect a variety of academic styles inspired the City Beautiful movement, including the Classical Revival style and Renaissance Revival. Simmons passed away in 1931 at age 60, but as many of his buildings were recognized in the late 20th century, he was survived by a son, B. Stanley Jr., and 11 grandchildren.

Life He was born in Porto, Portugal, the son of John Croft, merchant, and Henrietta Maria, daughter of James Tunstall. He was educated in a British school run by an Anglican clergyman Dr. Bell, who taught his pupils fluency in six languages. In 1795, at his father's request, Jack (his nickname), joined the family Port house. Five years later he sailed to London to become a scientist. His first work was as an assistant to Humphry Davy, the inventor of the miners' safety lamp. In 1803 he went to assist the botanist Joseph Banks. Jack was later admitted to the Royal Society, with recommendations by Davy and Banks and Peter Mark Roget.Records of The Royal Society, London. In 1814 he was also appointed an Associate of The Royal Academy of Science in Lisbon.Royal Academy of Science Lisbon records. In 1810 in the midst of the Peninsular Wars he met Charles Stuart, the British Minister to Portugal, who invited him to undertake a six-month espionage operation along the entire north coast of Spain from Corunna to the French border. His task was to organise a network of agents to report details of French troop movements to Stuart who, in turn, would sort them and pass them to Wellington. The following year Charles Stuart appointed Jack as the joint leader of the British Government Distribution Fund whose challenge was to provide aid to desolate Portuguese villagers in the war-torn villages. He quickly took charge of the operation and with his team of 16 volunteers provided blankets, clothing, food, medicines, livestock, etc. to 77,000 families. In 1814 the Portuguese Regent awarded him the Order of the Tower and Sword, four years later he was awarded a baronetcy, and in 1854 Portugal remembered him again with the title of Barao da Serra da Estrela.

The district received $669,550 state dollars in 2010 to provide preschool to 91 children. In 2013-14, Southern Tioga School District received a 667,900 PreK Counts grant from the state for preschool.Pennsylvania Department of Education, Pennsylvania 2013-14 Pre-K Counts Grantees, 2013 In 2015, Southern Tioga School District did not offer taxpayer-funded preschool.Pennsylvania Department of Education, Pennsylvania 2015 Pre-K Counts Grantees, 2015 Special education In December 2013, the district administration reported that 363 pupils, or 20% of the district's pupils, received special education services, with 51.8% of the identified students having a specific learning disability. In December 2012, Southern Tioga School District reported that 20% of the students received special education services, with 55% of identified students having a specific learning disability. Special education services in the Commonwealth are provided to students from ages three years to 21 years old. In the 2010-11 school year, the total student enrollment was more than 1.78 million students with approximately 275,000 students eligible for special education services. Among these students 18,959 were identified with mental retardation and 21,245 students with autism.Pennsylvania Department of Education, Testimony Hearing on Special Education Senate Republican Policy Committee, January 2013 The largest group of students are identified as Specific Learning Disabilities 126,026 students (46.9 percent) and Speech or Language Impairments with 43,542 students (16.2 percent). In December 2010, Southern Tioga School District reported that 17% of the students received special education services, with 59% of identified students having a specific learning disability. In December 2008, the district reported that 15.3% of the students received special education services. In 2007, Pennsylvania Secretary of Education Gerald Zahorchak testified before the Pennsylvania House Education Committee regarding full-day kindergarten. He claimed that districts which offered the program would see a significant decrease in special education students due to early identification and early intervention. He asserted the high cost of full-day kindergarten would be recouped by districts in lower special education costs. Southern Tioga School District has provided full-day kindergarten since 2003. The district has seen a slight increase in the percentage of special education students it serves, yielding no savings. The district engages in identification procedures to ensure that eligible students receive an appropriate educational program consisting of special education and related services, individualized to meet student needs. At no cost to the parents, these services are provided in compliance with state and federal law; and are reasonably calculated to yield meaningful educational benefit and student progress. To identify students who may be eligible for special education, various screening activities are conducted on an ongoing basis. These screening activities include: review of group-based data (cumulative records, enrollment records, health records, report cards, ability and achievement test scores); hearing, vision, motor, and speech/language screening; and review by the Instructional Support Team or Student Assistance Team. When screening results suggest that the student may be eligible, the district seeks parental consent to conduct a multidisciplinary evaluation. Parents who suspect their child is eligible may verbally request a multidisciplinary evaluation from a professional employee of the district or contact the Supervisor of Special Education. In 2010, the state of Pennsylvania provided $1,026,815,000 for special education services. This funding is in addition to the state's basic education per pupil funding, as well as, all other state and federal funding. The Pennsylvania Special Education funding system assumes that 16% of the district's students receive special education services. It also assumes that each student's needs accrue the same level of costs. The state requires each district to have a three-year special education plan to meet the unique needs of its special education students. Overidentification of students, in order to increase state funding, has been an issue in the Commonwealth. Some districts have more than 20% of its students receiving special education services while others have 10% supported through special education. The state requires each public school district and charter school to have a three-year special education plan to meet the unique needs of its special education students.Amy Morton, Executive Deputy Secretary, Public Hearing: Special Education Funding & Accountability Testimony, Pennsylvania Department of Education, November 11, 2011 In 2012, the Obama Administration's US Department of Education issued a directive that schools include students with disabilities in extracurricular activities, including sports.US Department of Education, U.S. Department of Education Clarifies Schools' Obligation to Provide Equal Opportunity to Students with Disabilities to Participate in Extracurricular Athletics, January 25, 2013 Southern Tioga School District received a $1,240,082 supplement for special education services in 2010. For the 2011‚Äì12, 2012‚Äì13 and 2013-14 school years, all Pennsylvania public school districts received the same level of funding for special education that they received in 2010-11. This level funding is provided regardless of changes in the number of pupils who need special education services and regardless of the level of services the respective students required.Pennsylvania Department of Education, Investing in PA kids, April 2012 For the 2014-2015 school year, Southern Tioga School District received an increase to $1,264,067 from the Commonwealth for special education funding.Pennsylvania Department of Education, Special Education funding report by LEA, July 2014 Gifted education The District Administration reported that 52 or 2.37% of its students were gifted in 2009. The highest percentage of gifted students reported among all 500 school districts and 100 public charter schools in Pennsylvania was North Allegheny School District with 15.5% of its students identified as gifted. By law, the district must provide mentally gifted programs at all grade levels. The referral process for a gifted evaluation can be initiated by teachers or parents by contacting the student's building principal and requesting an evaluation. All requests must be made in writing. To be eligible for mentally gifted programs in Pennsylvania, a student must have a cognitive ability of at least 130 as measured on a standardized ability test by a certified school psychologist. Other factors that indicate giftedness will also be considered for eligibility. Budget Pennsylvania public school districts budget and expend funds according to procedures mandated by the General Assembly and the Pennsylvania Department of Education (PDE). An annual operating budget is prepared by school district administrative officials. A uniform form is furnished by the PDE and submitted to the board of school directors for approval prior to the beginning of each fiscal year on July 1. Under Pennsylvania's Taxpayer Relief Act, Act 1 of the Special Session of 2006, all school districts of the first class A, second class, third class and fourth class must adopt a preliminary budget proposal. The proposal must include estimated revenues and expenditures and the proposed tax rates. This proposed budget must be considered by the board no later than 90 days prior to the date of the election immediately preceding the fiscal year. The preliminary budget proposal must also be printed and made available for public inspection at least 20 days prior to its adoption. The board of school directors may hold a public hearing on the budget, but are not required to do so.

According to the U.S. Census Bureau, Pennsylvania spent $7,824 Per Pupil in the year 2000. This amount increased up to $12,085 by the year 2008.U.S. Census Bureau., Annual Survey of Local Government Finances., 2000U.S. Census Bureau., 2008 Survey of Local Government Finances ‚Äì School Systems, 2010 All Pennsylvania school districts also receive additional funding from the state through several funding allocations, including: Reimbursement of Charter School Expenditures; Special Education Funding; Secondary Career & Technical Education Subsidy; PA Accountability Grants; and low achieving schools were eligible for Educational Assistance Program Funding. Plus all Pennsylvania school districts receive federal dollars for various programs including: Special Education funding and Title I funding for children from low-income families. In 2010, Pennsylvania spent over $24 billion for public education - local, state and federal dollars combined. By 2015, Pennsylvania is spending over $27 billion on public education (local, state and federal resources combined).State Senator Lloyd Smucker Senate Education Committee Chairperson, PCNTV Interview state education Budget, June 2015 =Accountability Block Grants= Beginning in 2004-05, the state launched the Accountability Block Grant school funding. This program has provided $1.5 billion to Pennsylvania's school districts. The Accountability Block Grant program requires that its taxpayer dollars are focused on specific interventions that are most likely to increase student academic achievement. These interventions include: teacher training, all-day kindergarten, lower class size K-3rd grade, literacy and math coaching programs that provide teachers with individualized job-embedded professional development to improve their instruction, before or after school tutoring assistance to struggling students, For 2010-11, Southern Tioga School District applied for and received $424,820 in addition to all other state and federal funding. The district used the funding to provide Increased Instructional Time and to provide full-day kindergarten for the 7th year.Pennsylvania Department of Education, Accountability Block Grant Mid Year report, 2010 =Ready to Learn grant= Beginning in the 2014-2015 budget, the State funded a new Ready to Learn Grant for public schools. A total of $100 million is allocated through a formula to districts based on the number of students, level of poverty of community as calculated by its market value/personal income aid ratio (MV/PI AR) and the number of English language learners. Ready to Learn Block Grant funds may be used by the districts for: school safety; Ready by 3 early childhood intervention programs; individualized learning programs; and science, technology, engineering and math (STEM) programs. Southern Tioga School District received $275,987 in Ready to Learn Grant dollars in addition to State Basic Education funding, Special Education funding, PreK Counts funding, transportation reimbursement, reimbursement for Social Security payments for employees and other state grants which the district must apply to receive. For 2015-16, the district received $312,873 in Ready to learn grant. =Classrooms for the Future grant= The Classroom for the Future state program provided districts with hundreds of thousands of extra state funding to buy laptop computers for each core curriculum high school class (English, Science, History, Math) and funded mandatory teacher training to optimize the instructional use of the computers. The program was funded from 2006-2009. Southern Tioga School District was denied funding by the PDE, in 2006-07. In 2007-08, Southern Tioga School District received $378,106 and in 2008-09 $136,238 for a total of $514,344. =Education Assistance grant= The state's EAP funding provides for the continuing support of tutoring services and other programs to address the academic needs of eligible students. Funds are available to eligible school districts and full-time career and technology centers (CTC) in which one or more schools have failed to meet at least one academic performance target, as provided for in Section 1512-C of the Pennsylvania Public School Code. In 2010-11 the Southern Tioga School District received $85,645. =Literacy grant= Southern Tioga School District did not participate in a Pennsylvania competitive literacy grant. The funding was to be used to improve reading skills birth through 12th grade. The district was required to develop a lengthy literacy plan, which included outreach into the community. The funds come from a Striving Readers Comprehensive Literacy grant, also referred to as the Keystones to Opportunity grant It is a five- year, competitive federal grant program designed to assist local education agencies in developing and implementing local comprehensive literacy plans. Of the 329 pre-applications by school districts reviewed by the Pennsylvania Department of Education, School District was one of only 148 entities that were invited to submit a full application. In County 5 school districts and one charter school were awarded funding for one year. The funds must be used for teacher training, student screening and assessment, targeted interventions for students reading below grade level and research-based methods of improving classroom instruction and practice. Districts must hire literacy coaches. The coaches work with classroom teachers to enhance their literacy teaching skills. Pennsylvania was among six other states, out of the 35 that applied, to be awarded funding. Pennsylvania received $38 million through the federal program. The Department of Education reserved 5% of the grant for administration costs at the state level. =Project 720= Project 720 was a high school reform program implemented for three years under the Rendell administration. The intent was to increase academic rigor and improve the instruction of teachers in the Commonwealth's high schools. Teachers were expected to use data driven instructional practices and to meet the needs of diverse learners. The 720 in the name referred to the number of days a student was in high school in ninth through 12th grades. High schools applied for funding and were required to agree to report to the PDE their plans, their actions and the outcomes. In 2007-08 budget year, the Commonwealth provided $11 million in funding. Southern Tioga School District was one of 161 PA public school districts to apply, receiving $300,000 funding over three years.Robert Hayes Postupac, PROJECT 720: A CASE STUDY OF HIGH SCHOOL REFORM, University of Pittsburgh, 2011 For 2010-11, Project 720 funding was decreased to $1.7 million by Governor Rendell. The grant program was discontinued effective with the 2011-12 state budget.PA Office of the Budget, 2011-12 Budget General Fund - State Appropriations, June 28, 2011 =Other grants= Southern Tioga School District did not participate in: Pennsylvania Department of Environmental Protection's Environmental Education annual grants, PA Science Its Elementary grants (discontinued effective with 2009-10 budget by Governor Rendell), 2012 and 2013 nor Pennsylvania Hybrid Learning Grants, nor the federal 21st Century Learning grants. Common Cents state initiative In 2008, Southern Tioga School District participated in the state's cost containment review program for school districts called Common Cents. The program called for the state to audit the district, at no cost to local taxpayers, to identify ways the district could save tax dollars.Pennsylvania Department of Education, Common Cents program - Making Every Dollar Count, 2007 After the review of the information, the district was not required to implement the recommended cost savings changes. It offered 10 proposals to save tax dollars in the district. Federal Grants Southern Tioga School District received $1,689,656 in ARRA - Federal Stimulus money to be used in specific programs like special education and meeting the academic needs of low-income students. This funding was in addition to all regular annual subsidies. The funding was limited to the 2009‚Äì10 and 2010-2011 school years. Due to the temporary nature of the funding, schools were repeatedly advised to use the funds for one-time expenditures like acquiring equipment, making repairs to buildings, training teachers to provide more effective instruction or purchasing books and software. =Race to the Top grant= Southern Tioga School District officials did not apply for the Race to the Top federal grant. When approved for the grant, the district would have received nearly one million dollars, in additional federal dollars, for improving student academic achievement. Participation required the administration, the school board and the local teachers' union to sign an agreement to prioritize improving student academic success. In Pennsylvania, 120 public school districts and 56 charter schools agreed to participate. Pennsylvania was not approved for the grant. The failure of districts to agree to participate was cited as one reason that Pennsylvania was not approved. =Title II grants= The Federal government provides annual grants to schools to be used to improve the quality of teacher instructions to pupils. The goal is to provide each child in public schools with \\"Highly Quality\\" teachers and principals as defined by the state. The funds are sent to the state Department of Education which distributes them to each school district and charter school. Beginning in 2002, the federal funding committed to Title II was $3,175,000,000. Public school district administrations must apply to the state annually for the Title II funds. In 2012-13, Southern Tioga School District received $125,599 in federal Title II funding.PDE, Title IIA egrants 2012-13, 2012 In 2014-15, Southern Tioga School District applied for and received $118,047.PDE, Title IIA egrants 2014-15, 2014 Real estate taxes In June 2015, the Southern Tioga School Board set property taxes at 16.0104 mills in Tioga County. Lycoming County residents 15.5860 mills. A mill is $1 of tax for every $1,000 of a property's assessed value. Irregular property reassessments have become a serious issue in the commonwealth as it creates a significant disparity in taxation within a community and across a region. Property taxes, in the Commonwealth of Pennsylvania, apply only to real estate - land and buildings. The property tax is not levied on cars, business inventory, or other personal property. Certain types of property are exempt from property taxes, including: places of worship, places of burial, private social clubs, charitable and educational institutions and government property. Additionally, service-related, disabled US military veterans may seek an exemption from paying property taxes. Pennsylvania school district revenues are dominated by two main sources: 1) Property tax collections, which account for the vast majority (between 75-85%) of local revenues; and 2) Act 511 tax collections, which are around 15% of revenues for school districts. When the school district includes municipalities in two counties as is the case with Southern Tioga School District (Tioga County and Lycoming County), each of which has different rates of property tax assessment, a state board equalizes the tax rates between the counties. In 2010, miscalculations by the State Tax Equalization Board (STEB) were widespread in the Commonwealth and adversely impacted funding for many school districts, including those that did not cross county borders. *2014-15 - 15.8108 mills for residents in Tioga County. Residents in Lycoming County - 14.9421 mills. *2013-14 - 15.1882 mills in Tioga County. Lycoming County - 14.2878 mills. *2012-13 - 15.1411 mills in Tioga County.

Lycoming County - 12.1400 mills The average yearly property tax paid by Tioga County residents amounts to about 3.44% of their yearly income. Tioga County is ranked 401st of the 3143 counties for property taxes as a percentage of median income. Property taxes in Pennsylvania are relatively high on a national scale. According to the Tax Foundation, Pennsylvania ranked 11th in the U.S. in 2008 in terms of property taxes paid as a percentage of home value (1.34%) and 12th in the country in terms of property taxes as a percentage of income (3.55%). According to a report prepared by the Pennsylvania Department of Education, the total real estate taxes collected by all school districts in Pennsylvania rose from $6,474,133,936 in 1999-00 to $10,438,463,356 in 2008-09.Pennsylvania School Finances - Summaries of Annual Financial Report Data 2008-09 =Act 1 Adjusted index= The Act 1 of 2006 Index regulates the rates at which each school district can raise property taxes in Pennsylvania. Districts are not allowed to raise taxes above that index unless they allow voters to vote by referendum, or they seek an exception from the state Department of Education. The base index for the 2011-2012 school year is 1.4 percent, but the Act 1 Index can be adjusted higher, depending on a number of factors, such as property values and the personal income of district residents. Act 1 included 10 exceptions, including: increasing pension costs, increases in special education costs, a catastrophe like a fire or flood, increase in health insurance costs for contracts in effect in 2006 or dwindling tax bases. The base index is the average of the percentage increase in the statewide average weekly wage, as determined by the PA Department of Labor and Industry, for the preceding calendar year and the percentage increase in the Employment Cost Index for Elementary and Secondary Schools, as determined by the Bureau of Labor Statistics in the U.S. Department of Labor, for the previous 12-month period ending June 30. For a school district with a market value/personal income aid ratio (MV/PI AR) greater than 0.4000, its index equals the base index multiplied by the sum of .75 and its MV/PI AR for the current year.Pennsylvania Department of Education 2010-11 Act 1 of 2006 Referendum Exception Guidelines. In June 2011, the Pennsylvania General Assembly eliminated six of the ten exceptions to the Act 1 Index. Several exceptions were maintained: 1) costs to pay interest and principal on indebtedness incurred prior to September 4, 2004 for Act 72 schools and prior to June 27, 2006 for non-Act 72 schools; 2) costs to pay interest and principal on electoral debt; 3) costs incurred in providing special education programs and services (beyond what is already paid by the State); and 4) costs due to increases of more than the Index in the school's share of payments to PSERS (PA school employees pension fund) taking into account the state mandated PSERS contribution rate. A specific timeline for Act I Index decisions is published annually, by the Pennsylvania Department of Education.

Property tax relief In 2013, the Homestead/Farmstead Property Tax Relief from gambling for the Southern Tioga School District was $184 per approved permanent primary residence. In 2010, the Homestead/Farmstead Property Tax Relief from gambling for the Southern Tioga School District was $188 per approved permanent primary residence. In the district, 3,487 property owners applied for the tax relief. This was the highest property tax relief in Tioga County. In Pennsylvania, the highest property tax relief went to residents in Chester Upland School District in Delaware County which received $632 per approved homestead. The relief was subtracted from the total annual school property tax bill. Property owners apply for the relief through the county Treasurer's office. Farmers can qualify for a farmstead exemption on building used for agricultural purposes. The farm must be at least 10 contiguous acres and must be the primary residence of the owner. Farmers can qualify for both the homestead exemption and the farmstead exemption.Property Tax Reduction Allocations 2010-2011 Fiscal Year In 2009 the district's allocation was $187 per homestead.Pennsylvania Property Tax Reduction Allocations Enrollment Enrollment in Southern Tioga School District was projected by the Pennsylvania Department of Education to decline by another 200 pupils by 2015.Pennsylvania Department of Education. Enrollment Data and Statistics by LEA. July 2010 Over the next 10 years, rural Pennsylvania school enrollment is projected to decrease 8 percent. The most significant enrollment decline is projected to be in western Pennsylvania, where rural school districts may have a 16 percent decline.\\"Research Analyzes Rural School District Enrollment and Building Capacity\\", The Center for Rural Pennsylvania. October 2009 As the enrollment declines, per pupil administrative costs of the schools rise significantly. Pennsylvania has one of the highest numbers of school districts in the nation. In Pennsylvania, 80% of the school districts serve student populations under 5,000, and 40% serve less than 2,000. Less than 95 of Pennsylvania's 501 school districts have enrollment below 1250 students, in 2007. This results in excessive school administration bureaucracy and not enough course diversity.Rendell, E. & Soderberg, M. (2009). Pennsylvania school district consolidation. 2009-10 Executive Budget Fast Facts. Pennsylvania Office of the Governor. In a survey of 88 superintendents of small districts, 42% of the 49 respondents stated that they thought consolidation would save money without closing any schools.Study of the cost-effectiveness of consolidating Pennsylvania districts. New York: Standard & Poor‚Äôs School Evaluation Services. 2007, p. 6. In March 2011, the Pennsylvania Institute of Certified Public Accountants Fiscal Responsibility Task Force released a report which found that consolidating school district administrations with one neighboring district would save the Commonwealth $1.2 billion without forcing the consolidation of any schools. Pennsylvania had 2,361 public school districts in 1959. The state compelled mergers reducing the number to 505 by 1980. Mergers slowed through the 1980s after a 1981 court order desegregated and combined the Edgewood, General Braddock, Swissvale, Churchill and Turtle Creek districts into the Woodland Hills district. Wellness policy Southern Tioga School Board established a district wellness policy in 2009. The policy deals with nutritious meals served at school, the control of access to some foods and beverages during school hours, age appropriate nutrition education for all students, and physical education for students K-12. The policy is in response to state mandates and federal legislation (P.L. 108 ‚Äì 265). The law dictates that each school district participating in a program authorized by the Richard B. Russell National School Lunch Act (42 U.S.C. 1751 et seq) or the Child Nutrition Act of 1966 (42 U.S.C. 1771 et seq) \\"shall establish a local school wellness policy by School Year 2006.\\" Most districts identified the superintendent and school foodservice director as responsible for ensuring local wellness policy implementation. The legislation placed the responsibility of developing a wellness policy at the local level so the individual needs of each district can be addressed. According to the requirements for the Local Wellness Policy, school districts must set goals for nutrition education, physical activity, campus food provision, and other school-based activities designed to promote student wellness. Additionally, districts were required to involve a broad group of individuals in policy development and to have a plan for measuring policy implementation. Districts were offered a choice of levels of implementation for limiting or prohibiting low nutrition foods on the school campus. In final implementation these regulations prohibit some foods and beverages on the school campus. The Pennsylvania Department of Education required the district to submit a copy of the policy for approval. The Southern Tioga School District offers a free school breakfast and free or reduced-price lunch to children in low-income families. All students attending the school can eat breakfast and lunch. Children from families with incomes at or below 130 percent of the federal poverty level are provided a breakfast and lunch at no cost to the family. Children from families with incomes between 130 and 185 percent of the federal poverty level can be charged no more than 30 cents per breakfast. A foster child whose care and placement is the responsibility of the State or who is placed by a court with a caretaker household is eligible for both a free breakfast and a free lunch. Runaway, homeless and Migrant Youth are also automatically eligible for free meals.USDA, Child Nutrition Programs - Eligibility Manual for School Meals, 2012 The meals are partially funded with federal dollars through the United States Department of Agriculture.Pennsylvania Hunger Action Center, The Pennsylvania School Breakfast Report Card, 2009 In 2013, the USDA issued new restrictions to foods in public schools. The rules apply to foods and beverages sold on all public school district campuses during the day. They limit vending machine snacks to a maximum of 200 calories per item. Additionally, all snack foods sold at school must meet competitive nutrient standards, meaning they must have fruits, vegetables, dairy or protein in them or contain at least 10 percent of the daily value of fiber, calcium, potassium, and Vitamin D.USDA, Child Nutrition Programs, June 27, 2013 In order to comply with the Healthy, Hunger- Free Kids Act of 2010 all US public school districts are required to raise the price of their school lunches to $2.60 regardless of the actual cost of providing the lunch. Southern Tioga School District provides health services as mandated by the Commonwealth and the federal government. Nurses are available in each building to conduct annual health screenings (data reported to the PDE and state Department of Health) and to dispense prescribed medications to students during the school day. Students can be excluded from school unless they comply with all the State Department of Health's extensive immunization mandates. School nurses monitor each pupil for this compliance. Nurses also monitor each child's weight. Extracurriculars Southern Tioga School District offers an extensive program of after school clubs, arts programs and a three times duplicated interscholastic athletics program. Eligibility to participate is set by school board policy. The district is noncompliant with state law, due to failing to post its Interscholastic Athletic Opportunities Disclosure Form on its website.Southern Tioga School District, Southern Tioga School District Website, 2016 All school entities with grades 7-12 are required to annually collect data concerning team and financial information for all male and female athletes beginning with the 2012-13 school year and submit the information to the Pennsylvania Department of Education. Beginning with the 2013-14 school year, all non-school (booster club and alumni) contributions and purchases must also be reported to PDE. By Pennsylvania law, all K-12 students in the district, including those who attend a private nonpublic school, cyber charter school, charter school and those homeschooled, are eligible to participate in the extracurricular programs, including all athletics. They must meet the same eligibility rules as the students enrolled in the district's schools. According to PA Child Abuse Recognition and Reporting Act 126 of 2014, all volunteer coaches and all those who assist in student activities, must have criminal background checks. Like all school district employees, they must also attend an anti child abuse training once every three years.Eleanor Chute., New Pa. law expands clearance requirements for school volunteers, employees, Pittsburgh Post-Gazette, December 15, 2014Ali Stevens., Child Protective Services Law impacts schools, WKOK.com 1070AM, January 6, 2015 Sports Coaches receive compensation as outlined in the teachers' union contract.

It is headquartered in the Nobel Forum on the grounds of the Karolinska Institute campus. Originally the Nobel Assembly was not a formal body but rather the collective of all professors (holders of chairs, i.e. full professors) at Karolinska Institute. In 1977 the Nobel Assembly became a separate private organization hosted by Karolinska Institute. Until 1984 all Karolinska Institute professors belonged to the Assembly; from 1984 the membership is restricted to 50 Karolinska Institute professors.Karolinska Institutet: Nobelpriset - den √§rofyllda traditionen, accessed on August 3, 2009 The main work involved in collecting nominations and screening nominees is performed by the Nobel Committee at the Karolinska Institute, which has five members. The Nobel Committee, which is appointed by the Nobel Assembly, is only empowered to recommend laureates, while the final decision rests with the Nobel Assembly.Nobelprize.org: Prize Awarder for the Nobel Prize in Physiology or Medicine , accessed on August 3, 2009  Background  The Nobel Prize in Physiology or Medicine was first awarded in 1901. For most of the 20th century the laureates were decided upon by all professors of the Karolinska Institute, collectively sometimes also referred to as the Nobel Assembly. In 1977 the Nobel Assembly was established as a separate private organization. The reason for creating a special formal body for the decisions concerning the Nobel Prize was the fact that the Karolinska Institute is a state-run university, which in turn means that it is subject to various laws that apply to government agencies in Sweden and similar Swedish public sector organisations, such as freedom of information legislation. By moving the actual decision making to a private body at Karolinska Institute (but not part of it), it is possible to follow the regulations for the Nobel Prize set down by the Nobel Foundation, including keeping the confidentiality of all documents and proceedings for a minimum of 50 years. Also, the legal possibility of contesting the decisions in e.g. administrative courts is removed. Until 1984 all professors at Karolinska Institute were members of the Assembly, but in 1984 the membership was restricted to 50 Karolinska professors. The other two Nobel Prize-awarding bodies in Sweden, the Royal Swedish Academy of Sciences and the Swedish Academy, are legally private organisations (although enjoying royal patronage), and have therefore not had to make any special arrangements to be able to follow the Nobel Foundation's regulations.

He was the fourth son of former Libyan leader Muammar Gaddafi, and a member of his father's inner circle. His mother was Safia Farkash, who was believed to have had Hungarian ancestry. He was captured during the Battle of Sirte by anti-Gaddafi forces, and killed along with his father.  Role in Libyan politics = Negotiations with the US  In April 2009, Mutassim Gaddafi met U.S. Secretary of State Hillary Clinton, the highest-level diplomatic exchange between the two countries since they resumed diplomatic relations several years earlier. For Gaddafi, it was a serious display of his new responsibilities as the National Security Advisor. He overreached his role as NSA in 2008 by requesting $1.2 billion from the National Oil Corporation to form his own special forces brigade. Mutassim Gaddafi met U.S. Senators John McCain and Joseph Lieberman in 2009, expressing a strong need for military support in Libya. Gaddafi warned, \\"There are 60 million Algerians to the West, 80 million Egyptians to the East, we have Europe in front of us, and we face Sub-Saharan Africa with its problems to the South.\\" He was concerned about upgrading Libya's military equipment, and said he could purchase arms from Russia and China, but wanted to buy material from the United States.  Possible successor  Mutassim Gaddafi lived in Egypt for several years after allegedly attempting to take control of Libya from his father. His return led to a reconciliation with his father and a high-ranking position as National Security Advisor of Libya. In 2009, a story linking Mutassim Gaddafi to the death of Ibn al-Shaykh al-Libi was published in Libyan newspaper Oea with permission from his brother Saif al-Islam.  Libyan civil war  During the Libyan Civil War, Gaddafi commanded the units in the Brega region notably during the Battle of Brega‚ÄìAjdabiya road and the skirmishes in the area. He had been subject to a travel ban and an asset freeze over his close links and membership of his father's inner circle. Gaddafi was allegedly in Tripoli in the Bab al-Azizia compound, and assisting in commanding what remained of pro-Gaddafi forces in the city during the Battle of Tripoli. However, no evidence of his presence was found by rebels when they captured the compound, nor was there evidence of a presence of any of his sons. He commanded the loyalist forces in their unsuccessful defense of Sirte, Muammar Gaddafi's hometown, until the city fell. It is believed Mutassim commanded the crackdown of protests.https://www.channel4.com/news/mutassim-was-in-charge- not-gaddafi-says-bodyguard  Personal life  Model Vanessa Hessler admitted to a four-year relationship with him (2007‚Äì2011), and she continued to defend him after his death.  Death  Mutassim Gaddafi was captured when Sirte fell on 20 October 2011. NTC commanders at the front in Sirte and officials in Tripoli claimed that he was captured as he was trying to leave the city in a family car, and sent off to Benghazi. Published film and photographs of Mutassim Gaddafi indicate that he was unconscious and injured‚Äîthe front of his shirt was heavily stained with blood‚Äîbut he was very much alive when he was captured by a group of young men appearing to be in their late teens or early twenties after apparently succumbing to nerve gas. He was made to drink water and requested a cigarette. Later photographs released by Saudi TV channel Al Arabiya show Mutassim Gaddafi lying dead on a hospital bed, with gaping wounds in his throat and abdomen and one of his arms had been dislocated. Amateur photographs and videos showed his young captors and others defiling his corpse after his death. Like his father, he was denied a burial within a day after death in accordance with Islamic law.

Renuka Sharma directed this film. The film is a remake of Tamil original Thambikku Entha Ooru (1984) which starred Rajinikanth and Madhavi. The film is best remembered for its successful soundtrack scored by Hamsalekha. Two songs from this movie were later re-used by Hamsalekha in two different Telugu movies. The movie had a theatrical run of 25 weeks and was declared a Blockbuster. The movie was one of the most notable Ravichandran movie of the 1980s. Anjada Gandu was the second highest grossing Kannada movie of the year 1988 after Ranadheera, another movie which featured both Ravichandran and Kushboo as the lead pair. Plot Ravichandran is the son of a rich businessman (Srinivasa Murthy) and is given to profligate ways. He is shown spending money wantonly in a club. He has concern for the poor people. He is shown breaking the window of a car when its owner does not pay a coconut vendor. He also thrashes a gang of unruly men in an upscale club when one of them mistreats the waiter. His catchphrase in this phase is shown to be \\"piece, piece\\" or alternatively \\"ella, piece piece\\" describing the state in which the target of his anger is left. His father is naturally angry with such behavior and feels that a spell in a village with his old school friend, Rudrappa (Thoogudeepa Srinivas) who has since been in the army will do the boy good. And therefore sends him off to a village, Tavarekere with an introductory letter which does not reveal that he is his son but only says that he is in need of some guidance for a year and that he should be taught some daily chores.

This album saw Bassey briefly return to her old label EMI (which also owns her United Artists recordings); the album was issued by EMI on the Music For Pleasure Premier label. All songs on this album were composed by Andrew Lloyd Webber. This is the first, and to date the only Songbook album that Bassey has recorded and released. In her early recording career she had recorded many songs from the Great American Songbook, but unlike Frank Sinatra, Ella Fitzgerald, and many other artists, she had never recorded a complete album of songs by one composer. The songs on the album are all taken from the popular musicals of Andrew Lloyd Webber, that he wrote with various lyricists. The oldest song found on the album is from the 1971 musical Jesus Christ Superstar which originally opened on Broadway in October of that year. Bringing it up to date the album also includes two songs from Sunset Boulevard which had recently premiered on July 12, 1993 in London's West End. Four songs had previously been recorded by Bassey: \\"I Don't Know How To Love Him\\" in 1972 for the album And I Love You So, \\"Don't Cry for Me Argentina\\" in 1978 for the album The Magic Is You, \\"Memory\\" in 1984 for the B-side of the European single \\"That's Right\\" and \\"All I Ask of You\\" in 1991 for the album Keep the Music Playing.

General (retired) Rom√©o Dallaire, Senior Fellow at the Montreal Institute for Genocide and Human Rights Studies (MIGS), and Dr. Frank Chalk, MIGS Director, that aims to operationalize the principles of the responsibility to protect within national governments.http://migs.concordia.ca/W2I/W2I_Project.html Report Led by researcher Kyle Matthews, more than 80 interviews were conducted with high-level policy-makers, members of Congress, parliamentarians, NGO representatives, and journalists in Canada and the United States, some for the first time on record. These interviews culminated in the publication of a policy report, Mobilizing the Will to Intervene: Leadership and Action to Prevent Mass Atrocities, in September 2009. This report was disseminated amongst the highest levels of the American and Canadian governments, think tanks, and non-governmental organisations. The report was subsequently re-edited and published as a book in 2010. The project describes itself as follows: > The fundamental goal the W2I report, entitled Mobilizing the Will to > Intervene: Leadership and Action to Prevent Mass Atrocities, is to identify > strategic and practical steps to raise the capacity of government officials, > legislators, civil servants, non-governmental organizations (NGOs), advocacy > groups, journalists, and media owners and managers to build the political > will to prevent mass atrocities. The report provides practical policy > recommendations to make this goal a reality. The report draws on interviews > with more than 80 foreign policy practitioners and opinion shapers in Canada > and the United States. Many of the interviewees participated directly in > Canadian and American government decision making during the 1994 Rwandan > Genocide and the 1999 Kosovo crisis, which exemplify a failure to act and a > strong will to act. The W2I Project's researchers also wanted to understand > what civil society groups and the news media could have done to ramp up the > pressure on Prime Minister Chr√©tien and President Clinton to save lives in > Rwanda. They wanted to learn if civil society played a role in the decisions > of Canada and the United States to preserve lives in Kosovo and what > considerations propelled the decision to intervene. They designed their > questions with an eye to the future, hunting for \\"lessons learned\\", informed > not only by their interviews, but also by scholarly studies of Canadian and > U.S. Government policies. The report was made public in Canada on 22 > September 2009. The Canadian parliamentary launch occurred on 1 October and > featured distinguished panel of experts who discussed W2I's policy > recommendations for the benefit of parliamentarians. The W2I project assembled a Research Steering Committee consisting of a distinguished group of prominent American and Canadian foreign policy experts and politicians to guide the researchers.

The W2I presented the report‚Äôs recommendations to American policy makers at the United States Institute of Peace on 21 September 2009.

In May 2010, President Obama‚Äôs National Security Strategy stated a commitment to proactive engagement in preventing mass atrocities and genocide. And then in June 2010, National Security Advisor James L. Jones, created an Interagency Policy Committee on Preventing Mass Atrocities.http://now.concordia.ca/what-we- do/research/20100913/will-to-intervene-one-year-later.php Vancouver designates Will to Intervene Day In addition, the US Senate passed Senate Concurrent Resolution 71 supporting genocide prevention, a resolution which the W2I team helped to draft.http://genocideintervention.net/blog/senate_unanimously_passes_resolution_genocide_prevention In 2011, the Obama administration announced the establishment of a new Atrocities Prevention Board, stating such prevention as a core moral responsibility and national security interest.

In July 1921 his family were early settlers in the new city of Tel Aviv in Palestine (the land that was to become the State of Israel). He attended the University of Jerusalem graduating in History and Philosophy. He had been brought up with encyclopedias. His mother published the eight-volume General Enclopedia. Peli's dream was to create a new encyclopedia in Hebrew. Obituary. In 1944 a committee was formed to work out the aims and objectives of a project to create an encyclopedia in Hebrew. In 1948 work was started, and Chaim Weizmann was the first president of the project. He was also to be the first president of the new state of Israel. Peli was appointed supervising editor and the first editor was Prof. Joseph Klausner The plans were drawn up and the first volume covered from Aleph to Australia. The introduction to the first volume boldly announced that it was planned to complete the encyclopedia project in \\"five to six years\\". The breadth and depth of the project was large. One entry for Israel took up a complete volume. When Peli's first editor died, he appointed Benzion Netanyahu in 1948. Netanyaho had been recommended by Klausner, before his death. The encyclopedia continued to be firmly an Israeli publication. Netanyahu, who was to remain editor until 1962, was the father future Israeli prime minister, Benjamin Netanyahu. The third editor that Peli appointed was possibly the most controversial. Professor Yeshayahu Leibowitz caused some delays with his arguments about content, although Leibowitz was difficult outside as well as within the project team. It was not until 1980 that another editor, Professor Joshua Prawer, managed to declare the encyclopedia as complete.

The base is located approximately south-southwest of Metz (D√©partement de la Moselle,Lorraine) ; about east of Paris. A military restructuring plan announced in July 2008 was to close BA 128 in 2011, and place it in reserve status (Base Interarmes).

History=Origins Following the defeat of France in the 1871 Franco-Prussian War, Metz and much of the Moselle were annexed by Germany as part of the Treaty of Frankfurt, and Metz became a \\"Garrison City\\" of the Imperial German Army (Reichsheer). In the early 20th century, the German army began building a Zeppelin field to the south-west of the city, at the present site of the airfield.History of Base A√©rienne 128 Metz-Frescaty (In French) World War I During World War I, in addition to the Zeppelins, the Luftstreitkr√§fte (Imperial German Army Air Service) began stationing airplanes at the airfield, which were later used in combat over the Western Front during the war. It became the target of French and British aircraft later in the war, starting about 1915 with the development of bomber and fighter combat aircraft. It also was the target for long-range artillery attacks. Following the armistice with Germany ending the First World War, the French army entered Metz in November 1918, and the airfield came under the control of the French Air Force (A√©ronautique Militaire). Between the wars In 1919, the first French Air Force units moved into Frescaty Air Base, when Bombardment Group No. 1 moved in from Landau in the Occupied German Rhineland-Palatinate. On 1 August 1920, the unit was redesignated as the 11th Aviation Bombardment Regiment (11th RAB). In 1927, the 3d Group of the 12th Aviation Regiment was also assigned, moving from Neustadt an der Weinstra√üe, also in the Occupied Rhineland. On 31 May 1934, Frescaty Air Base received the designation of base a√©rienne 111 (BA 111). The 11th Wing Frescaty left in 1936 and settled in Toulouse. Two years later, the transition from GB I/38 and II/38 on Amiot 143, causes the change in mission of the 38th Wing, which became the 38th Bombardment Wing in March 1939. By the following June 38 EB is reassigned to French North Africa. The Phony War and the Battle of France At the outbreak of World War II on 3 September 1939, the CAG 506 and GR II/22 (flying Bloch MB.131 reconnaissance-bombers and Potez 630 heavy twin- engined fighters) were present at Frescaty. Frescaty Air Base was bombed by the Luftwaffe on 10 May 1940 on the first day of the German attack in the West. After the Second Battle of Sedan (12‚Äì15 May 1940), GR II/22 was replaced by GR I/22. Frescaty Air Base was again attacked on 14 June, and was seized by the Wehrmacht shortly afterward. German control during World War II Under Luftwaffe control, the airfield was initially used as a night interceptor fighter base, with Nachtjagdgeschwader 4 (NJG 4) flying Messerschmitt Bf 110s and later RADAR-equipped Dornier Do 217s against the night attacks by the Royal Air Force on German targets. The Luftwaffe, 1933-45 In 1943, a dive bomber school, Schlachtgeschwader 103 (SG 103) was established at the base, training pilots with Arado Ar 96 advanced trainers; Focke-Wulf Fw 190Fs, and Junkers Ju 87s. The school closed in February 1944; the night fighters were reassigned in May. In June, day interceptor fighters of Jagdgeschwader 3 (JG 3) moved in with Messerschmitt Bf 109Gs to attack American Eighth Air Force heavy bombers. In July, Kampfgeschwader 101 (KG 101) arrived as part of the Mistel (German: Mistletoe), project, in which Junkers Ju 88A, bombers were controlled by a Messerschmitt Bf 109E, which was flown to the target by the fighter, then separated and guided, with a shaped 1,800 kg charge at the nose of the aircraft, and used as unmanned powered bomb. kg 101 flew several attacks against hardened Allied targets along the English channel coast. These activities led to Frescaty being attacked by USAAF Ninth Air Force B-26 Marauder medium bombers and P-47 Thunderbolts mostly with 500-pound General-Purpose bombs; unguided rockets and .50 caliber machine gun sweeps when Eighth Air Force heavy bombers (B-17s, B-24s) were within interception range of the Luftwaffe aircraft assigned to the base. The attacks were timed to have the maximum effect possible to keep the interceptors pinned down on the ground and be unable to attack the heavy bombers. Also the P-51 Mustang fighter-escort groups of Eighth Air Force would drop down on their return to England and attack the base with a fighter sweep and attack any target of opportunity to be found at the airfield.Derived from information in USAAF Film \\"Target For Today\\" (available at https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kkGL7vuC2A4) American control Y-34 Metz Airfield facilities during the winter of 1944/1945 Destroyed P-47 Thunderbolts due to the attack by the Luftwaffe, 1 January 1945 In November 1944, American Third Army forces moved into the Metz area and heavy fighting ensued between the Allies and the German forces. On 29 November the airfield was taken from German control. Combat engineers from IX Engineer command moved in with the 830th Engineering Aviation Battalion arriving on 5 December. Due to the heavy fighting in the area and extensive damage from the Allied bombing attacks on the base, much restoration work was necessary. A new 5000' Pierced Steel Planking metal runway was laid down aligned 02/20 for aircraft use, and after nearly a month the airfield was declared operationally ready on 25 December 1944 as Advanced Landing Ground \\"Y-34 Metz\\".IX Engineer Command ETO Airfields, Airfield Layout Under American control, Metz Air Base was turned over to the Ninth Air Force, being used as a P-47 Thunderbolt combat fighter-bomber airfield for the rest of the war.

JG 53 destroyed or damaged about 40 Thunderbolts of the 365th Fighter Group in the attack, but the damage to the airfield was quickly repaired, the destroyed aircraft moved off the ramp, and replacements arrived within a few days to continue the attack. JG 53 retreated into Czechoslovakia and Austria before it was finally disbanded in April 1945. On 29 May 1945, control of Metz Airfield was returned to the French Air Force. Postwar Although under French Air Force Control, the airfield was badly damaged by the war. Reconstruction began in April 1946. In 1950, when as a result of the Cold War threat of the Soviet Union, Metz-Frescaty was proposed by the United States Air Force to become an interim NATO fighter base, until other airfields could be constructed. In the ongoing negotiations, the site was ultimately rejected, and reconstruction of the base continued for French Air Force requirements.McAuliffe, Jerome J: U.S. Air Force in France 1950-1967 (2005), Chapter 2, Base Selection and Movement to France, 1950-1954 The new paved jet runway was officially opened 20 July 1951, but the first French Air Force flying units were not assigned until April 1956 when 1/9 \\"Limousin\\" left BA 139 (Lahr, West Germany) and moved to Frescaty Air Base. Construction of the facility continued until 1956. The air base was designated base a√©rienne 128 (BA 128) during the summer of 1956. During the past 50 years, many units have been assigned to the base, flying a wide variety of aircraft. The last combat unit was reassigned on 31 August 2004. Until closure, Metz-Frescaty Air Base was a fully equipped front line French Air Force Base, primarily being used for command, control and training along with electronic warfare.

This followed an earlier book by noted chronicler-of-the-wealthy (Our Crowd, The Grandes Dames) Stephen Birmingham Real Lace: America's Irish Rich HarperCollins New York: 1973 in which this family were also the main subjects. The Murray/ Mc Donnell clan were the children and grandchildren of inventor Thomas E. Murray, an associate of Thomas Edison's, who was an early summer resident of Southampton, Long Island, New York . Due to their wealth, good looks, and sheer size (one branch, the James Mc Donnells, had 14 children; another, the Thomas E. Murray Jr.s, had 11) they were frequently covered in the social news of the New York press, particularly in the Hearst newspapers by gossip columnist 'Cholly Knickerbocker'. Public interest increased when one Mc Donnell married Henry Ford II, and a Murray cousin Alfred G. Vanderbilt II. Unlike the Kennedy family, with whom several of the Mc Donnells were close, none of the family ran for public office. The eldest son of the patriarch- Thomas E. Murray, Jr., was appointed by President Truman to the United States Atomic Energy Commission and his brother John 'Jack' Murray to the Port Authority of New York by Governor Franklin D. Roosevelt. The McDonnell triplex at 910 Fifth Avenue in New York was reputedly the largest in the city.Real Lace: America's Irish Rich, Stephen Birmingham HarperCollins New York: 1973 The clan were considered pillars of the New York Archdiocese, and were very close to Cardinal Spellman and Bishop Fulton J. Sheen; when Clare Boothe Luce converted to Catholicism, Bishop Sheen suggested that Anna Murray Mc Donnell serve as her godmother. The family has pretty much faded from the public spotlight since the collapse of Mc Donnell & Co., the family stock brokerage firm under T. Murray Mc Donnell in 1970. Several family members such as Catherine Murray di Montezemolo were still prominent in Southampton society at the beginning of the 21st Century, and they continued to intermarry with other prominent Catholic families. Peggy Mc Donnell, a daughter of T. Murray Mc Donnell, is the wife of Manhattan District Attorney Cyrus Vance, Jr. Several other wealthy Irish Catholic families were also discussed in Corry and Birmingham's books, and have been referred to in print as \\"Golden Clans\\". Foremost perhaps would be the descendants of Thomas Fortune Ryan.Among whom: John Barry Ryan , Clendenin J. Ryan and Virginia Fortune Ryan. The Grace family, the grandchildren of William R. Grace such as J. Peter Grace, would be another. Also mentioned were F. Scott Fitzgerald's friends Gerald and Sara Murphy; Gerald's father, the founder of Mark Cross Leather Goods, was a Southampton friend of Thomas Murray. Quite a number of these families sent their sons to Portsmouth Abbey School and Canterbury School (Connecticut) and then on to Georgetown University, and their daughters to Convent of the Sacred Heart schools and Manhattanville College.Assimilation in American Life, Milton M.

Tetlock and Shelley Taylor. She also received an Honorary M.A. Degree from Harvard University in 2007. Work in psychology Lerner's research focuses on the influence of specific emotions (e.g., happiness or anger), in contrast to most models, which focus on larger categories of emotions (e.g., positive moods or negative moods) on behavior and decision making. She has proposed a framework which predicts that the influence of a specific emotion on judgment depends on a variety of cognitive factors related to the source of each emotion. Currently she is working to test predictions from this framework. For example, in a series of studies, her research examines the distinct effects of fear, anger, and happiness on risk perception and risk preference.

Plot Bob's wife, Margaret, is attempting to throw a surprise birthday celebration for Bob while he is at work; she tells him that they are going to a restaurant when she calls him. Bob works as a dentist and is seemingly going through a mid-life crisis on his 40th birthday. The short film shows Bob staring at a young woman in the office while his wife is at home working on the surprise party. She has a closet full of decorations to make the celebration fun for everyone. Bob's patient goes on to tell him that he had read that dentists have the highest suicide rate of all professions and continues to ask about his hours and salary while Bob works on the patients' teeth. The film continues at home when everyone arrives at Bob and Margaret's house for the party. As they await Bob's presence, Margaret watches the time and quickly checks the window to notice he is driving down the road and tells the guests to hide until she gives a signal for them to come out. When Bob arrives, he walks directly to the kitchen, disregarding Margaret, and then asks her if she is bothered that they never had children and questions whether he should leave his job as a dentist. The guests continue to hide while Bob changes. As he is changing he comes down the stairs not wearing any pants and Margaret frantically tells him to put pants on. He takes this to offence and says that she used to love when he did that, furthering his mid-life crisis even more. Bob continues speaking about how all of their friends, who are hiding behind couches and listening, are not really their friends and that they do not even like them. He goes on to say that Margaret should find another husband and becomes jealous. Bob yells up to Margaret, who is in the bedroom and upset over the disaster of a surprise party, and says that they should have children. He goes on to ask if she finds him attractive while she brings down underwear and pants for him. He goes outside to wait in the car because he still believes they are going out for dinner. Margaret follows him, knowing the party she had planned is now destroyed, and leaves all their friends she had invited behind.National Film Board of Canada.

He broke a leg in 1982, missing the 1982 Scotland rugby union tour of Australia. Leslie scored Scotland's first try against in 1984, only his second for Scotland. He played for Gala RFC, which he captained. Controversially, he was left off the 1983 British Lions tour to New Zealand. In 1984, he was voted Rugby World's \\"Player of the Season\\". Richard Bath writes of him that: :\\"Throughout his career, he was consistently the most focussed and fearless player in a Scottish squad which had more than its fair share of fearless breakaways... for all his intensity, Leslie found it hard to establish himself in the Scottish side until late on in his career.\\" Allan Massie considered that: :\\"Leslie's first quality is courage. All back-row forwards have to be brave, but Leslie's courage defies reason and probability alike: he reckons any ball on the ground is his to win. The courage is so blinding that one is apt to overlook the skill, judgement and timing with which he launches himself at such balls and attaches himself to them. :\\"He is in fact a very skilful educated player (he often played fly-half in his schooldays). He gives and takes a pass better than most of the Scottish three-quarter line. He has acquired the knack of dipping his shoulder into the tackler and slipping the ball at the same moment to a supporting player. He kicks well. Perhaps though his greatest asset with the ball in his hand is his intuitive knowledge of what is right. Jim Telfer has said that he can stop worrying when Leslie has the ball, being 99 per cent sure that he will out it to the best use possible. This is a quality that many of even the best and most spectacular of back-row men never acquire.\\"Massie, p192-3 He went to school at High School of Dundee and Glenalmond College.

Allan Massie describes him as \\"Hawick through and through, and is indeed now President of the Club\\". International career Hugh McLeod propped alongside Tom Elliot of Gala RFC and David Rollo of Howe of Fife RFC. He was only twenty one when he first played for Scotland, a young age at the time, and retired from international rugby at thirty.Massie, p167 He was made pack leader for a while, and the story goes that some of the posher, or anglified players could not actually understand his accent; one of his semi-humorous phrases as pack leader was \\"Come here, my wee disciples.\\" In 1955 he took part in the British Lions tour of South Africa and afterwards published his diary of the tour (Hugh McLeod Diary - The British Lions Rugby Tour of South Africa 1955). In 1959 he played on the 1959 British Lions tour to Australia and New Zealand. Richard Bath writes of McLeod that he :\\"proved himself one of the best tight-forwards that Scotland has ever produced. Despite being only 5ft. 9in. tall and weighing in around 14 stone - McLeod was a fitness fanatic and mighty scrummager as well as a player of surprising pace who made a huge contribution in the loose. After beginning his rugby career at the age of 16, it was less than a year before McLeod was drafted into the Hawick first-team pack, then one of the mightiest forward units in Britain. Within four years, and only just out of his teens, he made his Test debut against the New Zealanders - a 3-0 defeat at Murrayfield.\\" Allan Massie is equally flattering: :\\"He was short, broad-shouldered and huge- thighed, rather harder than teak, but a scrupulous and utterly honest player. Superlatives exhausted themselves on him quickly, for the fact that technically he did everything right. The merit of his front-row play may be gauged by the fact that the Scotland pack in his time held its own in the tight, despite a lack of real weight and strength in the second row...\\" He was a personal friend of Bill McLaren, also from Hawick, who describes him as \\"A man for whom I always have had the highest respect and admiration.\\"McLaren, p 75 :\\"come here, my wee disciples.

On the evening before the 1963 game between and at Colombes in Paris, Hugh McLeod and Bill McLaren were out having a meal together and bumped into ten Bos near a cafe.McLaren, p123 Hugh McLeod took Ten Bos aside, and told him bluntly: :\\"Frans, ye think ye're a guid forrit [forward] but really ye're jist a big lump o' potted meat.

He was part of the side that beat South 19-6 in the final match, again ensuring that Glasgow shared the championship title, this time with South and Edinburgh District. International career He played for Scotland 15 times between 1972 and 1978. Richard Bath writes of him that: :\\"As with most great players, their greatness comes in part from their ability to combine with other great players of the era. David Shedden, a flier from the Glasgow's West of Scotland club, was lucky to be playing at the same time as Andy Irvine, one of the great attacking full-backs of all time. A classic speed merchant, Sheddden profited from Irvine's ability to slice through opposing defences, and would regular pop up on the full-back's shoulder to take a final scoring pass. Shedden, who was limited to only 15 caps because his career overlapped with another of Scotland's great wingers Billy Steele, was also defensively astute and went on providing cover when Irvine went on his charging runs upfield... It was not until Tony Stanger won his first cap eleven years later that Scotland had another out-and-out flier to rely on.\\"Bath, Richard (ed.) The Complete Book of Rugby (Seven Oaks Ltd, 1997 ) He won the Calcutta Cup with Scotland against England at Murrayfield in 1976. Unfortunately he suffered concussion after bravely tackling Andy Ripley of England during the match. While he was on the park however he provided rugby commentator Bill McLaren with one of his top five sporting memories with his counter attack setting up of Alan Lawson's first try that day. After rugby Shedden developed dementia in his early 50s. This was thought to be linked to his rugby career as he suffered 13 concussions throughout his rugby career. Shedden's form of dementia was thought to be Chronic Traumatic Encephalopathy (CTE), brought on by the cumulative effect of head trauma. He took part in the Rugby Memories programme for its therapeutic effects. On his death his former West of Scotland and Scotland international team-mate Sandy Carmichael gave this tribute: :\\"I used to pull his leg about his thin-ness but he was a brave, brave player.\\" :\\"In those days, the Scottish selectors had a policy that you had to weigh more than 11 stones to be picked. We knew we'd be weighed at the first District game and we piled keys, coins, anything we could find, into Dave's tracksuit pockets to get the scales over 11 stones. He was a great man.\\" ReferencesExternal links * Category:1944 births Category:2017 deaths Category:Scottish rugby union players Category:Scotland international rugby union players Category:West of Scotland FC players Category:Glasgow District players Category:Old Spierians players ","title":"David Shedden"},{"id":"24583909","text":"The grave of Bishop Spencer Madan, Peterborough Cathedral The Rt Revd Spencer Madan DD (1729‚Äì1813) was an English churchman, successively of Bishop of Bristol and Bishop of Peterborough. Life The son of Colonel Martin Madan and Judith Madan of London, and younger brother of Martin Madan, he was sent to Westminster School in 1742, and in 1746 went to Trinity College, Cambridge. In 1749 he graduated B.A. as third wrangler, M.A. 1753, D.D. 1756. He was at first intended for the bar, like his elder brother, but shortly after took holy orders. In 1753 he was elected to a fellowship at his college, but after short residence became vicar of Haxhay with the rectory of West Halton, both in Lincolnshire. In 1761 he was appointed chaplain in ordinary to the king, a position which he held till 1787, being also from 1770 to 1794 prebendary of Peterborough, and at the same time rector of Castor, Northamptonshire. In 1776 he was appointed to the sinecure rectory of Ashley, Berkshire, and in 1793 was promoted as Bishop of Bristol, where he was consecrated bishop on 3 June. Early in 1794, on the death of John Hinchliffe, he was translated to Peterborough, where he remained till his death, at the age of eighty-four, on 8 November 1813. He was buried in Peterborough Cathedral. The grave lies at the east end of the cathedral. Family Madan was twice married, first to Lady Charlotte, second daughter of Charles Cornwallis, 1st Earl Cornwallis (who died 1794, aged 68, and was buried in the Abbey Church at Bath). By her he had two sons, Spencer, and William Charles, who became a colonel in the army; and a daughter, Charlotte who married General George Warde (1725‚Äì1803). In 1796 the bishop married, secondly, Mary Vyse, daughter of William Vyse of Lichfield and sister of William Vyse (1741‚Äì1816), archdeacon of Coventry.W. Newling and J.C. Woodhouse, A Short Account of Lichfield Cathedral, Fourth Edition, with additions and an engraving (T.G. Lomax, Lichfield 1834), pp. 81-83 (Google). Madan left no issue by his second marriage.

It was built about 1900-1901, and is a brick Queen Anne style brick dwelling. It features a three-story tower in the southeast corner topped with a wrought-iron balustrade. The architect is unknown. It was a single family home until 1931, after which it was a boarding house, fraternity house, home of the University Christian Council, and law offices. It is currently the location of the Morgantown Chabad Jewish Center. It was listed on the National Register of Historic Places in 1983. It is located in the Downtown Morgantown Historic District, listed in 1996. Location The Walters Residence is located just outside of the original Morgantown city limits. However, Morgantown expanded its city limits to accommodate its growing population at the same time as when the house was built. At this time, upper-class residents had yet to move out to the high-end suburbs that were developed later in the twentieth century and still lived in large houses in the downtown area. History=Walters and Fling residence In 1899, William E. Glasscock, future governor of West Virginia, and his wife, Mary, sold the land to Mary S. Walters. The house was constructed during Mary's ownership some time before 1902. When Mary S. Walters died in 1913, the property was conveyed to her heirs who later sold the property to Ona Fling in 1920. During the intervening years, city directories show Rev. William H. Berry, the rector of St. Paul's Lutheran Church, and his wife, Venetia, living at the address. The 1920/1921 city directory lists the Sigma Nu fraternity at the address. Ona Fling lived at the property from around 1920 until she died in 1931. In the later years of her residence, she rented out rooms in the house. Ona Fling's heirs rented the property to tenants who may have operated a boarding house and later, to the Sigma Phi Epsilon and Tau Kappa Epsilon fraternities. By 1945, Elsie Fling Price, one of Ona's heirs, was living in the house and renting out rooms. In 1951, Elsie and the other heirs sold the property to Ivan M. and Ades Shahan Bowers. Ivan Bowers operated Bowers‚Äô Rooming House at 447 High Street in downtown Morgantown. Conversion to campus ministry In 1965, the Bowers conveyed the property to the trustees of the Trinity Episcopal Church of Morgantown who rented the house to students. Around 1971, the Trinity Episcopal Church leased the building to the University Christian Council (UCC), a relatively new ecumenical campus ministry. The campus ministry occupied the first floor and students continued to live in the upper stories. The University Christian Council emerged from the ecumenical movement within the field of campus ministry, which was active at West Virginia University in the late 1960s.Bonni McKeown, Peaceful Patriot: The Story of Tom Bennett (Charleston, WV: Mountain State Press, 1980). In 1969, the ecumenical campus ministry center was named the Bennett House in honor of Thomas Bennett. Thomas Bennett was a conscientious objector who was killed in Vietnam while serving in the Army Medical Corps. He was posthumously awarded the Congressional Medal of Honor. When he was a student at West Virginia University, Thomas Bennett served as the president of the Campus Ecumenical Council and was very involved in the campus ecumenical movement and social causes.Terry Belck, ‚Äú‚ÄòHe Was In Love With People' Bennett House conveys Tom‚Äôs spirit,‚Äù The Daily Athenaeum, March 24, 1970, 1-B. Interview with Reba Thurmond, May 1, 2017. At the peak of the campus ecumenical movement, West Virginia University's campus ministry center included United Methodists, Roman Catholics, Presbyterians, Episcopalians, Lutherans, and Disciples of Christ ministers.Scott Midmeyer, ‚ÄúReach Out - Bennett House: a common bond,‚Äù The Daily Athenaeum, September 21, 1972, 1. In late twentieth-century Morgantown, many campus ministers, particularly those of liberal Protestant denominations, worked closely with student activists and were involved in social activism.Bonni McKeown, Peaceful Patriot, 135-151. In the 1970s, campus ministers in the Bennett House were involved in a number of student and community projects, including draft, drug, and abortion counseling. The Women's Information Center, which was founded in 1971, operated within the campus ministry until the early 1990s under the direction of Reba Thurmond, United Methodist campus minister. The Center offered anonymous pregnancy testing and pro-choice counseling as well as programs on women's issues. The organization's philosophy was to empower women with information to make their own decisions regarding their sexuality and reproductive lives.Ken Weiss, \\"Women's Information Center Formed,\\" The Daily Athenaeum, September 21, 1971, 3.

It was a collaborative project of the Women's Information Center, the local National Organization for Women chapter, and the Women's Affairs Committee of WVU. The organization provided services to victims of sexual assault, hosted public programming on sexual assault, and lobbied for legislative changes.

The Trinity Episcopal Church disagreed with some of the activities of the University Christian Council, specifically the Women's Information Center. Eventually, the disagreement caused the UCC to move out of the Walters Residence in 1979.

The Tobique Reserve, established in 1801 with nearly 20,000 acres, was granted after a petition to the government by band members. Over the years, the reserve was reduced by surrenders to squatters and a major surrender in 1892. Roughly two-thirds of members of the Tobique First Nation reside on the reserve lands.\\"Tobique Band\\", Aboriginal Affairs and Northern Development Canada In 2009 the government accepted the Tobique Specific Land Claim related to 10,533 acres which they claimed to have lost in the invalid surrender of 1892.

History Photograph of a Maliseet camp in Tobique in 1865 (by George Taylor). An 1854 survey established that the original Tobique reserve had an area of 18,394 acres. The Tobique lost 2,539 acres lost in the town of Perth due to squatters pre- and post-confederation. In addition, they argue under the Tobique Specific Land Claim (see sections below) that they lost 10,433 acres in the alleged 1892 Surrender. 1892 Surrender Claim In 1890 the government of New Brunswick attempted to open a large portion of the Tobique Reserve for settlement by non-Aboriginal peoples. In order to move towards this goal, the government of New Brunswick conducted a land surrender in 1892. But, the surrender was conducted without the consent of the Order in Council, a necessary step in the surrender process. The surrender concerned land \\"south of the Tobique river saving and excepting a tract of two hundred acres on the south-side designated as Indian Meadows.\\" The government sold most of the land to individuals, except for , which was returned to the Tobique band in 1965. The Tobique First Nation has been working on the issues of land claims. It has filed two specific claims suits: one for the 2,539 acres lost in the town of Perth; and one for more than 10,000 acres lost in the 1892 surrender, which amounted to nearly two-thirds of its land. On May 23, 2008 Canada accepted only the second as the Tobique Specific Land Claim for negotiation on the basis of its lawful obligation due to an invalid surrender.\\"Backgrounder - Tobique First Nation ‚Äì 1892 Surrender Claim\\", Aboriginal Affairs and Northern Development Canada Under the terms of negotiation, the government and First Nation have three years to reach agreement on a compensation package for the claim.

The First Nation rejected the company's bid to construct a hydro- electric dam on the Tobique River in 1844, and in 1895. By 1945 the provincial and federal governments had started development of a dam on the Tobique River, the Tobique Narrows Dam. In 1950 the Premier of New Brunswick approved the construction of the Mactaquac Dam in south-central New Brunswick without the consent of the Tobique First Nation, the legal landowners. It was put into service in 1953. Despite a longstanding (1945) offer from Tobique to settle all disputes in exchange for unlimited use of the dam's power within Tobique for all domestic uses [and] business on the reservation. According to many reports, \\"this was never honoured. As soon as the community had power lines, they received power bills.

They have said the damming of the river has created environmental problems. In 2008 the Tobique began a protest, refusing to pay the \\"bills\\" from NB Power. In addition, they demanded that the company remove from the reserve construction debris, including barrels filled with toxic pesticides and herbicides, and PCBs, that dated to the dam's construction. When the company threatened to cut off power to the reserve, a number of residents set up a blockade at the dam, requiring NB Power trucks to register with the Nation before entry. In 2009 tensions escalated when an NB Power truck did not stop at a road block. Members of the Nation seized the NB Power truck.\\"Tobique Protest NB Power\\", CBC, 30 June 2009 On June 30, 2009, the provincial Minister of Aboriginal Affairs committed to funding the clean-up of toxic and other wastes dumped at and around the dam, as well as restoration of eroded riverbanks, further damages noted by the Tobique. The effects of the dams on the St. John's River have been to drastically reduce the Atlantic Salmon run, cutting into the ability of the Tobique to feed themselves and adversely affecting the local economy.Daniel Thau-Elaff, ‚ÄúPack Up and Get Out,‚Äù, The Dominion, 29 August 2009, accessed 25 November 2011 As the blockade entered its third month in the summer of 2009, Ottawa‚Äôs Department of Justice accepted the Tobique First Nation‚Äôs specific land claim for negotiation. It is likely to be one of the largest in Atlantic Canada. The Tobique wanted to negotiate some sharing of benefits from the dam, with some portion of electricity available at least to reserve residents but preferably also for resale. An offer by New Brunswick Power to resolve the dispute by offering up to 5 megawatts of power from the dam, which produces approximately 20 megawatts, is under consideration. However, with modern run of the river hydroelectric technology, the power potential of the river is very much greater, in hundreds of megawatts.

Suggested non-Indo-European words in Irish Gear√≥id Mac Eoin proposes the following words as deriving from the substrate: br√©ife 'ring, loop', cufar, cuifre/cuipre 'kindness', fafall/fubhal, lufe 'feminine', slife, strophais 'straw'; and the following placenames: Br√©ifne, Crufait, D√∫n Gaifi, Faffand, Grafand, Grafrenn, Life/Mag Liphi, M√°fat. Peter Schrijver submits the following words as deriving from the substrate: part√°n 'crab', Partraige (ethnonym), (note that partaing \\"crimson (Parthian) red\\" is a loanword from Lat. parthicus), pattu 'hare', petta 'pet, lap-dog', pell 'horse', p√≠t 'portion of food', pluc '(round) mass', prapp 'rapid', gliomach 'lobster', faoch√°n 'periwinkle', ciot√≥g 'left hand', brad√°n 'salmon', scad√°n 'herring'. In a further study he gives counter-arguments against some criticisms by Graham Isaac.

Examples of words found in more than one branch of Celtic but with no obvious cognates outside Celtic include: *Middle Irish 'young woman', Middle Welsh 'heifer', perhaps Gaulish anderon (possibly connected with Basque 'lady, woman') *Old Irish 'short', Middle Welsh 'short', Gaulish Birrus (name); possibly related to the birrus, a short cloak or hood *Old Irish 'raven', Middle Welsh 'raven', Gaulish Brano-, sometimes translated as 'crow' (name element, such as Bran Ardchenn, Bran Becc mac Murchado, and Bran the Blessed) *Middle Irish 'badger', Middle Welsh 'badger', Gaulish Broco- (name element) (borrowed into English as brock) *Old Irish '(war) chariot', Welsh , Gaulish carpento-, Carbanto- *Old Irish 'salmon', Middle Welsh 'salmon', Gaulish *esoks (borrowed into Latin as ); has been compared with Basque izokin *Old Irish 'piece', Middle Welsh 'thing', Gaulish *pettia (borrowed into Latin as and French as ) *Old Irish 'wether', Middle Welsh 'ram, wether', Gaulish Moltus (name) and *multon- (borrowed into French as , from which to English as mutton) The Old Irish word for \\"horn\\", adarc, is also listed as a potential Basque loanword; in Basque the word is adar.https://www.jolr.ru/files/(101)jlr2012-8(160-164).pdf See also *Pre- Celtic *Pre-Greek substrate *Pre-Indo-European languages *Prehistoric Ireland *Mythological Cycle *Germanic substrate hypothesis References Category:Languages of Ireland Category:Prehistoric Ireland Category:Indo- European linguistics Category:Celtic studies Category:Pre-Indo-Europeans Category:Linguistic strata ","title":"Goidelic substrate hypothesis"},{"id":"24584123","text":"Lord Avie (April 25, 1978 ‚Äì December 28, 2012http://www.paulickreport.com/news/bloodstock/the-lord-reigned-lord- avie-1978-2012/) was an American thoroughbred champion racehorse.

Novus International Headquarters in Saint Charles, Missouri When being considered for certification, the Council uses several criteria in determining eligibility. These criteria include: energy savings, water efficiency, emissions reduction, improved indoor environmental quality, and stewardship of resources and sensitivity to their impacts.http://www.allbusiness.com/environment-natural-resources/pollution- monitoring/11815081- 1.html In order to achieve Platinum LEED certification, a building must score between 52 and 69 points. Novus‚Äôs project totals, according to pre-certification estimates, were 69 points. Features of the Novus International global headquarters facility which contribute to the achievement of Platinum LEED certification include: Electricity * The second largest array of solar panels in Missouri (5,000 square feet). * Three percent of the building‚Äôs electricity comes from the 35-kilowatt photovoltaic panels. They provide 44,835 kilowatt hours of energy annually. * Exchanged all of the outdated, inefficient fluorescent light fixtures with new, more efficient models. * Fitted with floor-to-ceiling windows and skylights in order to take advantage of the natural day lighting. * Certificates have been purchased for 100% electricity from renewable wind sources on the Blue Grass Wind Farm in northwest Missouri and a wind farm in Texas.

It was developed by Thechineseroom. Korsakovia was released as freeware download on 20 September 2009. Plot In Korsakovia, the player travels through the delusions of Christopher, a man suffering from Korsakoff's syndrome. The player hears the voices of Christopher and a doctor as they try to help Christopher. Location The game takes place in numerous presumably illusory locations, ranging from an asylum to a factory. Objects sometimes float or otherwise defy the ordinary laws of physics. The player has the standard Half- Life 2 flashlight, but it often runs out of electricity and must be turned off to recharge. The overall ambiance is nightmarishly grim, grimy, and depressing, an effect that is amplified considerably by atmospheric music and sound effects. The narrator's words imply that the player is under treatment in a hospital while he is having the delusions that constitute the game. Before the beginning of the game, Christopher was found in his living room with copper wire around his hands. He had punched the television and the wires caught fire, which is the cause of the damage to his hands. He also seems to have ripped his own eyeballs out and eaten them as reported by the paramedics. These injuries and their rationale are referenced repeatedly in the narration and by objects the player finds in his illusory landscape. Gameplay Like Thechineseroom's previous mod, Dear Esther, the player explores the environment while listening to narration. However, this time the player can move far more freely and is sometimes armed with a crowbar, which he uses to smash through obstacles or ward off monsters composed of black smoke. The player can also pick up health packs to repair damage, the existence and extent of which is indicated by cracks spreading inward from the edges of his screen. If the player \\"dies\\" as a result of too much damage, they are returned to the last previous save point.

Bean, who described the Spottail pinfish. John Holbrook, for whom the Spottail pinfish was named . The Spottail pinfish was described in 1878 by Tarleton Hoffman Bean, an ichthyologist who worked mainly on the Connecticut coast. He originally placed it in the genus Sargus, but it was later moved to Diplodus. Bean named the Spottail pinfish after John Edwards Holbrook, a zoologist who had died 7 years before. Description Spottail pinfish are almost totally gray in color, with a large, black spot on the distal end of the caudal peduncle. This is similar to other members of its genus, Diplodus annularis and Diplodus sargus -though D. sargus has several vertical bars that the Spottail pinfish does not. Diplodus sargus, a similar species which common to areas where Spottial pinfish are found. Distribution and habitat Spottail pinfish are exclusive to the western Atlantic ocean. They can be found from Chesapeake bay to southern Florida. Spottail pinfish are also known from the northern Gulf of Mexico, but are not known from the West Indies. There are only questionable reports from Cuba. Spottail pinfish are common to shallow waters (only as deep as 28m) near coasts, such as bays and harbors, though only rarely in brackish areas. They prefer flat, vegetated bottoms such as beds of sea grass, where they feed on a mixture of plants (such as Thalassia) and small invertebrates. Behavior Spottail pinfish school in small numbers, but generally mix with many other species such as the Porkfish, Gray snapper, Bluestriped grunt, Sailor's grunt, and the Bucktooth parrotfish. Fishing Spottail pinfish readily eat several baits such as shrimp (live or artificial), squid, and clams. Usually they are a pest fish when trying to catch a larger fish.

AiR has behavioral health case management services for chronic disease care and specializes in the treatment of chemical dependency, mental health and eating disorders.Carew, Emma. \\"Eaten Alive,\\" Minnesota Monthly, February 2007. AiR is an organization of professional intervention specialists, recovery and addiction licensed counselors and consultants who provide crisis management services through education, action and healing alongside their behavioral health management services and aftercare recovery assistance programs. The implementation of case management improves outcomes for clients. This increase is a result of consistent support for the family or organization and ongoing advocacy with appropriate clinical support for the individual.McLellan, A. Thomas, ‚ÄúHave We Evaluated Addiction Treatment Correctly? The company maintains offices in 15 cities within the United States, with a staff of board certified clinical psychologists, social workers, addiction counselors and therapists. The company also manages cases from outside the United States. History Assistance in Recovery (AiR) follows in line with the philosophy and practice of Dr. Vernon Johnson, the creator of the Johnson Model of intervention, which stresses the need to break through the denial harbored by most who suffer from addiction. By confronting and promoting the positive outcomes of treatment while explaining the negative consequences of refusal, the individual becomes enabled to make an informed, active decision regarding his/her disease. In the 1990s, Dr. Johnson‚Äôs successor Dr. James Fearing began National Counseling Intervention Services (NCIS) in Minneapolis. His goal was to educate families about addiction and provide national intervention training.Finley, Michael. \\"Keeping Your Nose Clean,\\" Twin Cities Business Monthly. January 2004 NCIS was one of the foremost intervention training sources until Dr. Fearing‚Äôs death in 2002. Employed and trained by Dr. Fearing as an interventionist in the mid nineties, Andrew Wainwright created AiR with the same goal in 2002. Wainwright's understanding of addiction recovery came not only from his experience working under Dr. Fearing, but also from his own personal recovery from heroin addiction in the mid-1990s. After his mother urged him to seek recovery while in a psychiatric ward in Washington D.C., Wainwright entered treatment at the nationally recognized Hazelden center in Center City, Minnesota. While in treatment, Wainwright met Robert Poznanovich and together began Addiction Intervention Resources, Incorporated.*Stodghill, Ron. \\"Addicts-R-Us,\\" Fortune Small Business, Dec. 2005/Jan. 2006. The company was the first to implement both Dr. Johnson's model of recovery and the Family Systems model. The AiR Model focuses on a fast initiation of care while also helping the family cope. In so doing, they increase the rates of recovery for those struggling to overcome addiction or behavioral health issues.McKenzie, Sarah. \\"Duo Prospers by Resuing Addicts,\\" Minneapolis-St. Paul Business Journal.

It left the state on August 21 for Lebanon, Ky., but retired to Louisville upon Bragg's advance. It then moved to Frankfort, Scottsville, Gallatin and Cave City in pursuit of Morgan's forces. It was in camp near Gallatin during December and moved in January 1863 to Murfreesboro, being engaged in scouting and brief expeditions, with the 2nd Brigade, 3rd Division, 14th Army Corps. On June 24 it started for Tullahoma, participated in the Battle at Hoover's Gap and was the first regiment to enter the enemy's works at Tullahoma. Moving then towards Chattanooga, it was engaged at Chickamauga, losing 17 killed and 107 wounded. It remained near Chattanooga during the fall and winter and was engaged in the battle of Missionary Ridge. It moved to Ringgold, Georgia in Spring 1864, joined the campaign to Atlanta, and was engaged at Dalton, Resaca, Dallas, Kennesaw Mountain, Peachtree Creek, in front of Atlanta, and at Jonesboro. On October 4, the regiment moved with its corps to Pine Mountain, and arrived in time to threaten the rear of French's division of Hood's army, which was investing the garrison at Allatoona.

An ectomycorrhizal species, it is found in Asia, Africa, and North America. The species has a complex taxonomic history, and has undergone several name changes since its first description by American mycologist Lewis David de Schweinitz in 1822. The fruit bodies of the fungus are brightly colored yellow to orange, and usually highly conspicuous against the soil in which they are found. At maturity, the mushroom resembles a filled funnel with the spore- bearing surface along the sloping outer sides. The texture of the fertile undersurface (hymenium) of the caps is a distinguishing characteristic of the species: unlike the well-known golden chanterelle, the hymenium of C. lateritius is much smoother. Chemical analysis has revealed the presence of several carotenoid compounds in the fruit bodies. Taxonomy Berkeley is credited with the original authorship of the species. The species was first described in the scientific literature as Thelephora cantharella by the American Lewis David de Schweinitz in 1822, based on specimens collected in Ohio. Elias Magnus Fries later transferred it to Craterellus in his 1838 Epicrisis Systematis Mycologici. In 1856, Miles Joseph Berkeley and Moses Ashley Curtis mentioned the fungus in their analysis of Schweinitz's specimens, but changed the epithet, calling it Craterellus lateritius. The motivation for the name change is unclear; Ronald H. Petersen, in a 1979 publication, suggests that Berkeley \\"was apparently reluctant to surrender his own name for the organism\\". Petersen suggests that Berkeley may have foreseen the necessity to avoid giving the species a tautonym (a situation where both the generic name and specific epithet are identical). However, as Petersen indicates, a future publication renders this explanation dubious: in 1873 Berkeley again referred to the species using his chosen name Craterellus lateritius, and indicated a type location (Alabama) different than the one mentioned by Schweinitz. Petersen considers Berkeley's name to be a nomen novum (new name), not a new species, as Berkeley clearly indicated that he thought Craterellus lateritius was synonymous with Schweinitz's Thelephora cantharella. Normally in these circumstances, Schweinitz's specimen would be considered the type, but Petersen was unable to locate Schweinitz's original specimen, and thus according to the rules of botanical nomenclature, Berkeley's epithet has precedence as it is the earliest published name that has an associated type specimen. Another synonym is Trombetta lateritia, used by Otto Kuntze in his 1891 Revisio Generum Plantarum. American mycologist Rolf Singer transferred it to the genus Cantharellus in 1951. The mushroom is commonly known as the \\"smooth chanterelle\\". The specific name lateritius means \\"bricklike\\", and refers to the smooth hymenium. Description The hymenium is initially smooth before developing shallow vein-like ridges in maturity. The caps of the C. lateritius fruiting bodies typically range between in diameter, with a flattened to somewhat funnel-shaped top surface and a wavy margin. The cap surface is dry, slightly tomentose (covered with a layer of fine hairs), and a deep and bright orange-yellow color, with older specimens fading to more yellow in age; the distinctive margins of the cap are a paler yellow, and typically curve downward in young specimens. Fruiting bodies can reach a height of . The hymenophore (the spore-bearing surface) is initially smooth and without wrinkles, but gradually develops channels or ridges, and what appear to be very shallow gills that are vein-like, and less than 1 mm wide. The color is pale yellow, and is continuous with the surface of the stem. The stem is rather plump and stout, long and thick, more or less cylindrical, tapering downwards towards the base. Internally, the stems are either stuffed (filled with cotton-like mycelia) or solid. Rarely, fruiting bodies may be clumped together with stems conjoined at the base; in these cases there are usually no more than three fused stems. The flesh is solid to partly hollow (sometimes due to insect larvae), with a pale yellow color; it is thick. The spores are smooth, with a roughly ellipsoid shape, and have typical dimensions of 7‚Äì7.5 by 4.5‚Äì5 ¬µm.Bigelow (1978) reports more a permissive range of spore sizes: 7.5‚Äì9.5 (occasionally up to 12.5) by 4.5‚Äì6(6.5) ¬µm In deposit, such as in a spore print, the spores are light yellow orange, while under the microscope they are a very pale yellowish. The spore bearing cells‚Äîthe basidia‚Äîare 75‚Äì80 by 7‚Äì9 ¬µm, 4-5-6-spored,Bigelow (1978) reports instead 35‚Äì72 by 5‚Äì7.5 ¬µm, and four spores. slightly club- shaped, and with a distinctly thickened wall at the base. Clamp connections (short branches connecting one cell to the previous cell to allow passage of the products of nuclear division) are present in the hyphae of all parts of the fruiting body. Similar species Cantharellus lateritius is pinker than the golden chanterelle (C. cibarius), and has thicker flesh in addition to the smoother hymenial surface. C. odoratus is also similar in appearance, and is distinguished by a thinner flesh and a hollow stem. The poisonous \\"Jack O'Lantern\\" mushroom, Omphalotus olearius, is roughly similar in stature and color, but can be differentiated from C. lateritius by its true gills with sharply defined edges, and growth on decaying wood (although the wood may be buried in the soil), usually in large overlapping clusters. One author considers Cantharellus lateritius to likely represent a species complex, including \\"all the chanterelles with a completely smooth hymenophore, sweet smell, and clamped hyphae.\\" Edibility Like all species in the genus Cantharellus, C. lateritius is edible, and considered choice by some. The odor resembles apricots, and the taste is mild, or \\"moderately to faintly acrid\\". In the opinion of McFarland and Mueller, authors of a field guide to edible fungi of Illinois, compared to the well-known C. cibarius, C. lateritius is \\"in general ... somewhat disappointing when compared with their delicious relatives\\". Distribution and habitat Not yet fully mature specimens collected from Strouds Run State Park, Ohio Cantharellus lateritius is distributed in North America, Africa, Malaysia, and the Himalayas (specifically, the Almora hills in Uttar Pradesh). In the United States, its range extends northward to Michigan and New England. Typically found growing solitary, in groups or in clusters under hardwood trees, the fungus produces fruit bodies in the summer and autumn. In the New England area of the United States, mycologist Howard Bigelow has noted it to grow on road shoulders in grass near oaks; it also has a predilection for growing on sloping creek banks. In Malaysia, it is found growing on the soil in forests, mostly under species of Shorea (rainforest trees in the family Dipterocarpaceae). C. lateritius has been reported from the Western Ghats, Kerala, India, forming ectomycorrhizal association with endemic tree species like Vateria indica, Hopea parviflora, Diospyros malabarica, Myristica malabarica in semi-evergreen to evergreen forests. Bioactive compounds In a 1998 study, the carotenoid composition of this species was compared to several other Cantharellus species, including C. cibarus, C. cibarius var. amythysteus, and C. tabernensis. The carotenoid content between species was \\"virtually identical\\", comprising Œ≥-carotene, Œ±-carotene, and Œ≤-carotene. The only significant difference was that C. lateritius contained a significant quantity of an unidentified carotene that was thought to be a breakdown product of Œ≤-carotene.

It originally aired on October 5, 2009.  Plot  Robin and Barney are officially girlfriend and boyfriend, but Barney is having trouble adjusting to couple life. He sneaks out of bed after sex as if it was a one-night stand, and when Robin has an awful day, he avoids consoling her, telling her to meet him afterwards for sex. After Robin protests, Ted criticizes Barney for his behavior and tells him that if he does not improve, their relationship will not last. Barney makes more of an effort to be a better boyfriend to Robin. When he begins acting evasively, Robin fears that he is cheating on her. She tells Lily who tells her that she is overreacting. Robin then breaks into Barney's briefcase and finds a notebook full of notes about her, although she initially thought that Barney was cheating on her with a college girl. Barney is actually taking night classes from Ted: \\"Robin 101: How to date Robin Scherbatsky\\". Marshall decides to get rid of a barrel he named Mabel that he used for years as a nightstand. He was saddened when he had to get rid of it due to Lily's \\"barrel resin allergy\\". He puts it in \\"The Bermuda Triangle\\", otherwise known as the front step, and he waits anxiously by the window with his binoculars waiting to see who will take the barrel. So far, there are no takers. In \\"Robin 101\\", Ted teaches Barney which topics will distract Robin from being angry, which include hockey, guns and emperor penguins. He also teaches Barney about Robin's expressions and things to never do around her. At first, Barney plays the part of the distracted and bored student, but after Ted tests the knowledge he has given him, Barney asks him to stay. Unfortunately, Ted's successful classes with Barney are interrupted when Robin finds out about the lessons and shows up for class. Robin gets angry, accusing Ted of not knowing her at all, and storms out. Ted stops by MacLaren's to talk to Robin, and he convinces Robin to give Barney another chance. Ted mentions how Barney usually tries to get rid of women after one night, but was amazed to find him try hard to keep Robin around. Robin finds Barney, who gives up his \\"Robin notebook\\", and apologizes to her, admitting that he was scared that she would break up with him. She forgives him and as they kiss, she reminds him that the notebook contains a lot of personal information, but the notebook mysteriously vanishes before they can reclaim it, and Marshall is upset because his barrel has still not been claimed.  Critical response  Donna Bowman of The A.V. Club rated the episode with a grade A-. Brian Zoromski of IGN gave the episode 8 out of 10.

Based on the 1984 novel of the same name by Warren Adler, the film is about a police officer and a Congresswoman who discover that their spouses were having an affair prior to being killed in an air disaster. Plot Sergeant William \\"Dutch\\" Van Den Broeck (Harrison Ford) is a police sergeant in the internal affairs department of the Washington, D.C. Metropolitan Police Department, working on a case involving a crooked detective. He is married to a fashion editor. Kay Chandler (Kristin Scott Thomas) is a Congresswoman running for re-election. She is married to a lawyer and has a teenage daughter. A Boeing 737-300 bound for Miami crashes, and everyone on board is killed. Dutch realizes that his wife was on the plane, but the airline has no record of her. He believes that she was registered under another name and was having an affair, and he finds out that she was sitting next to Kay's husband. Wanting to learn more about the affair, he meets with Kay. Concerned about the publicity, she is not willing to talk and tells him to leave her alone. Dutch goes to Miami and visits the hotel that his wife was planning to go to. Kay, who has changed her mind, meets with him there. They talk more about the situation. After flying back home, they kiss in her car. Dutch goes to a campaign fundraiser for Kay and convinces her to not drop out of the race. He invites her to his cabin near Chesapeake Bay. She visits him, and they have sex. Dutch still wants to know more about the affair and believes that their two spouses had an apartment together, but Kay tells him that they should forget about the past and move on with their lives. Stressed, Dutch is suspended from his job after assaulting a suspect. He and Kay each find out about the apartment separately. When Dutch goes to visit the apartment, he finds Kay already there cleaning everything out. She leaves, and he chases her into the street, where he is shot by the suspect in his case. He lives, and the suspect is caught. With rumors about their relationship growing, Kay publicly confirms that she and Dutch are friends. Dutch soon gets promoted to lieutenant, and Kay loses her bid for re- election. As she is leaving Washington, Dutch meets her at the airport. The two are happy to see each other, and he asks if he can take her out on a date sometime.

In the 1980s, actor Dustin Hoffman met with the book's author with a view to making the film. Although Hoffman prompted CBS Theatrical Films to acquire the rights with a view to his starring in the film, he rejected several drafts of the script before leaving the project altogether. In the early 1990s, Kevin Costner was attached to star in the project, which was then to be directed by James L. Brooks, though this, too, never came to pass, the crash of the Boeing 737 was inspired by the crash of Air Florida Flight 90, a Boeing 737-200 that took off from Ronald Reagan Washington National Airport with destination to Tampa Bay, Florida.

Review aggregation website Rotten Tomatoes retrospectively gives the film a rating of 15% based on reviews collected from 87 critics. The site's consensus states: \\"Even Harrison Ford could not save the dull plot and the slow pacing of the movie.\\" The film received a 38% approval rating on Metacritic, based on 35 reviews. In a positive review from The New York Times, Janet Maslin wrote that the films of Sydney Pollack \\"have managed to be linear while also drifting thoughtfully through the nuances of their characters' behavior, with a stylistic polish and keenness of observation not often found in American films any more.\\" Maslin also noted that \\"laconic Ford is wrenchingly effective throughout.\\" In the Chicago Sun-Times, Roger Ebert wrote, \\"There are so many good things in Random Hearts, but they're side by side instead of one after the other. They exist in the same film, but they don't add up to the result of the film.

History The business was formed in 1920 by John McLean and incorporated in 1932. From the early 1950s the Company moved progressively into private housebuilding in the west midlands.Company Prospectus Nov 1963 It also developed similar homes in Dublin in the Republic of Ireland at the same time. It was the second generation Geoffrey McLean who led the Company's post-war growth. He was notable for the modern application of marketing methods, including the part exchange of customers' existing house, careful estate layouts and timber- framed production.\\"Building\\" April 1967 Growth after the flotation was disappointing and in 1969 the Company acquired Midland & General Developments, then controlled by one-time estate agent Eric Pountain. In that year there were further losses on local authority housing contracts and McLean profits fell below their flotation level. Following a boardroom coup, Eric Pountain replaced Geoffrey McLean as managing director and the business was rationalised. Helped by a buoyant private housing market, housing sales reached the 1000 a year mark. At the end of 1972, McLean agreed to a bid from Tarmac which wanted to strengthen its own poorly performing housing division.Wellings, Fred: Dictionary of British Housebuilders (2006) Troubador. , The combination of the two companies, still trading as McLean Homes, produced a 2,000 unit a year housebuilder, putting the enlarged business into the top ten. Under Pountain's management, McLean steadily expanded its regional network and was building nearly 4,000 houses a year by the end of the 1970s by which time Pountain had progressed to become managing director of the whole Tarmac group, following another boardroom coup. Housing continued to expand and by 1987 McLean was the largest housebuilder in the country; sales in 1988 exceeded 12,000. The recession that started in 1989 took its toll on Tarmac, which had continued to buy land even as the market was turning down. Provisions of over ¬£130m were eventually made against the housing division. Pountain resigned as CEO in 1992 and the Tarmac group came under the control of its construction division managing director. The housing division was reduced in scope and in 1995 a decision was made to dispose of the group's housing interests. The result was an asset swap with Wimpey whereby Wimpey acquired Tarmac's housing interests in return for its construction and quarrying divisions.

It is located along the Ouareau River, a right tributary of the L'Assomption River. The most interesting local attraction is the Trou de F√©e (lit. \\"Fairy Hole\\"), a cave on the west bank of the Ouareau River. History The area began to be populated at the end of the 18th century. In 1845, the first saw mills were built along the Ouareau River, but didn't survive for long as they were washed away by spring floods. The real impetus for the town's development came in 1905 when Edwin Crabtree bought land in what would become the centre of the municipality to build a paper mill. He founded the Edwin Crabtree and Sons Ltd. and built the mill also along the Ouareau River to take advantage of its hydraulic power. A year later, the post office opened under the name \\"Crabtree Mills\\". In 1912, the mill was destroyed by fire, but was rebuilt within a year. Gradually a small village grew near the mill, including the so-called \\"English Street\\" (la rue des Anglais) with its residences for the managers, boarding house, the entertainment hall \\"Beaver S Club\\", tennis court and park. A dam on the Ouareau River was built in 1917-18. Edwin Crabtree and Sons Ltd. joined the Howard Smith Paper Mills group (subsequently bought by Domtar), and the plant was modernized. Today Kruger Products operates the mill. In 1921, the Parish of Sacr√©-C≈ìur-de-J√©sus was formed, and on December 27 of that year, it was also civilly incorporated as the Parish Municipality of Sacr√©-C≈ìur-de-J√©sus. Kay Crabtree was the first mayor. On July 1, 1922, the School Commission of the Parish of Sacr√©-C≈ìur-de-J√©sus-de-Crabtree was established. On March 9, 1930, the mill workers formed the Syndicat National des Travailleurs de la Pulpe et du Papier (\\"National Union of Pulp and Paper Workers\\"), one of the oldest unions affiliated with the paper and forestry sector of the Confederation of National Labour Unions. For a long time the place was also identified with the extended name Sacr√©-C≈ìur-de-J√©sus-de-Crabtree-Mills. In 1945, the village itself separated from the parish municipality and was incorporated as the Municipality of Crabtree. In 1991, Sacr√©-C≈ìur-de-J√©sus was renamed to Sacr√©-C≈ìur-de-Crabtree to avoid confusion with a municipality in the Beauce by the same name. On October 23, 1996, both places were merged into the new Municipality of Crabtree.

Production American-born producer Varick Frissell's previous short films, The Lure of Labrador and The Swilin' Racket (also known as The Great Arctic Seal Hunt), prompted him to make a full-length feature entitled Vikings of the Ice Field. Paramount Pictures put up $100,000 to finance the production, while insisting that Hollywood personnel be used. Frissell hired director George Melford, who had attended McGill University in Montreal and had experience in filming Canadian subjects previously. By 1930, Frissell had completed most of the principal photography on location in Quidi Vidi. For realistic footage, Frissell then took his crew to the Grand Banks and Labrador to film action sequences. The film was privately shown at the Nickel Theatre at St. John's on March 5, 1931. After this screening, Frissell decided that his film needed more real scenes from the Labrador ice floes. Within days, Frissell and his crew had joined the SS Viking for its annual seal hunt.

It was a huge predator about 5‚Äì6 metres in length and, like all rauisuchians, was equipped with a large head of long sharp teeth. The legs were placed almost underneath the body, unlike most reptiles, which would have made it quite fast and a powerful runner. The appearance was very similar to that of the more known Postosuchus, of North America, and shared with the latter the ecological niche of the apex predator.http://www.myshowmywords.com/polonosuchus-silesiacus/ Discovery It was described as Teratosaurus silesiacus in 2005 by Tomasz Sulej,Sulej, T. (2005). \\"A new rauisuchian reptile (Diapsida: Archosauria) from the Late Triassic of Poland.\\" Journal of Vertebrate Paleontology, 25(1):78-86. and was transferred to the genus Polonosuchus by Brusatte et al. in 2009. However, it is still considered closely related to the remaining Teratosaurus species, Teratosaurus suevicus. In Polonosuchus, the rostromedial foramen is on the medial surface of the maxilla, and the foramina for replacement teeth are not connected by a dental groove but are set together in a straight line, unlike in Teratosaurus. It also had a larger first dental alveolus than Teratosaurus, no different in size from alveoli 2-4, shorter overall maxillae (165 mm as opposed to 245 mm), and a large ridge between the palatal process and the dental alveoli which is not present in Teratosaurus at all.  Description  Size compared to a human The holotype, and only known specimen, is fragmentary. From the skull are preserved both maxillae, premaxillae, nasals, prefrontals, palatines and quadrates, the left jugal, the right pterygoid, quadratojugal, surangular, articular, squamosal and lacrimal, and fragments of the dentary. There are also the first three cervical vertebrae, nine caudal vertebrae, some caudal scutes and fragments of cervical ribs.  Skull  The maxillae are tall and laterally compressed, forming most of the borders of the antorbital fenestra (visible on the photo above). The palatal process extends anteroventrally and is very short. A ridge extending to form a suture with the palatine is present above the sixth, seventh and eighth dental alveoli. Small infraorbital foramina are located around the edge of the antorbital fenestra, near the teeth. At least eleven dental alveoli were present, although the total is not certain as both maxillae are broken off at the posterior ends. Small replacement teeth are visible above some of the alveoli, indicating it was probably a polyphyodont. The premaxillae are very similar to those of Postosuchus, but slightly smaller; the posterodorsal process is broken off, but sutures present on the nasal bones show it would have extended all the way up to the anterior border of the naris. The palatal processes of the premaxillae are incompletely preserved, but would almost certainly have articulated with those of the maxillae. There are certainly four alveoli present, with a small cavity which may be a fifth. The nasals have a long dorsoventrally compressed process which would have extended down between the maxilla and premaxilla. They also have a long anterior process with a triangular cross-section. The surface for articulation with the lacrimal is clearly visible on the right nasal. Restoration The lacrimal has a thick rugose ridge extending back from that on the nasal. Its lamellar part forms the posterodorsal border of the antorbital fenestra, and is articulated with the maxillae which form much of the rest of the borders. There is also a descending process of the lacrimal which forms most of the posterior border of the antorbital fenestra, with a noticeably striated ridge. This descending process would probably have contacted the jugal at its ventral end. The prefrontals are large triangular plates which overhang the orbits, with rugose lateral surfaces. All the surfaces which articulate with the other bones of the skull roof are narrow and oblique. The squamosal has five projections. Two of these bordered the superior temporal fenestra and met with the parietal and postorbital, which are not known. A hook-like ventral projection would have met the quadrate head, and a lateral projection would have overhung the quadratojugal. The fifth projection is broken off and missing. Much of the jugal is preserved, although not the anterior or ascending processes. The posterior process has straight margins. The ascending process had a triangular cross-section at the base, where it articulates with the pterygoid. The quadratojugal is only partial, with a broken dorsal edge. Its process for articulating with the quadrate is clearly visible, and that for the jugal is long and indented. Skull bones The palatines have a robust anterior and fragile posterior. Relative to their overall length, the region between the choanae and the suborbital fossae is very long. An oblique vertical wall rises from the dorsal surface, separating part of the nasal fossa. There are two ridges which cross on the ventral surface. The pterygoid has a missing anterior ramus. Its posteroventral ramus has missing parts, but the centre is preserved and exhibits a cleft for the ectopterygoid. The quadrate ramus extends back with a narrow shelf on the ventral side. A small facet at its base forms part of the articulation with the basisphenoid, which is common for Triassic archosaurs. The quadrate has a rounded dorsal head which contacts the squamosal, and a high and narrow pterygoid ramus. There is a strong posterior ridge along the quadrate's main axis. Above the two parts of the mandibular condyle, there is a well-defined facet for articulation with the quadratojugal. The anterior parts of the dentary are preserved, up to the first eight teeth. The lateral faces bear a series of vascular foramina. The articular and surangular are fragmentary, and one of the few features preserved is a foramen for a branch of the facial nerve.  Vertebrae  Vertebrae The centrum of the atlas vertebra is the only part preserved, and has a crescent shape and rounded anterior surface. The other two vertebrae have centra longer than they are tall. The axis has a triangular neural spine and relatively small prezygapophyses, at least compared to the stout postzygapophyses. The third cervical vertebra has an incomplete neural spine and equally sized post- and prezygapophyses. The caudal vertebrae have pronounced facets for the haemal arches, and tall plate-like neural spines. The centra have smooth convex ventral surfaces, and as the vertebrae are fairly large, they probably come from the anterior part of the tail.  Dermal armour  Silesaurus and Polonosuchus models in Poland Five dermal scutes were found in close proximity to the caudal vertebrae, indicating that they are probably from the tail. The two largest are rectangular and have articulatory processes, indicating that they would have overlapped and linked together. The three smaller plates are leaf-shaped and their articulatory processes are in a different place, indicating the presence of at least two distinct rows of medial dermal armour.

Bryan Deemer and Peter Rios began the Comic Geek Speak podcast in 2005 and the roster of hosts has expanded to include Shane Kelly, Kevin Moyer, Jamie D., Matt, Adam \\"Murd\\" Murdough, Brian \\"Pants\\" Christman, Chris Eberle, and Ian Levenstein. The hosts express their individual opinions in an informal way that many fans think resembles a discussion between friends hanging out at home or at the local comic shop, giving the podcast a unique point of view. Comic Geek Speak has interviewed over 400 creators including Stan Lee, Terry Moore, Jamal Igle, Marv Wolfman, Gene Colan, Dave Sim, Geoff Johns, Matt Fraction, Joe Kubert, Freddie Williams II, Paul Pope, Jonathan Hickman, Denis Kitchen, Sean McKeever, and David Petersen, among many others. Other shows have included top 5 discussions, debates, interviews with retailers, and spotlights on specific characters or publishers. The CGS hosts also regularly visit comic conventions, giving day-to-day overviews of their experiences as attendees, interviewing creators as they promote their upcoming projects, talking to listeners, and even moderating or participating on panels. CGS's motto is \\"We Are Uniting the World's Mightiest Heroes One Listener at a Time\\". The motto stems from a listener contest, won by Chris Whittington. The podcast engages in interactive communication with its listeners via email, voice mail, and its own forum. Listeners can ask questions, suggest ideas for future episodes, participate in contests and are occasionally given the chance to guest-hosts a show that touches on a specific topic of interest. CGS recently celebrated their 1,000 numbered episode that was recorded on January 9, 2010. Peter Rios has since left the show, he is the first Geek to officially leave CGS. He has since begun his own successful podcast: The Daily Rios. Episodes and segments The CGS crew release episodes Monday through Friday. Over 1,230 episodes have been released, ranging from regular shows on current comic books and comic events, to more focused discussions. These discussions include: * Book of the Month ‚Äì A reading club designed to get listeners interested in and exposed to books they may not have been exposed to otherwise. The categories of books rotate from month to month, Marvel, DC, Indie, Manga, and Host Choice. * Indie Publisher Spotlight ‚Äì Showcases various independent and small press comics, as well as the companies and creators behind these titles. * Let's Talk Shop ‚Äì A discussion about comics and the industry with different retailers and comic book store owners. * Off The Rack ‚Äì A discussion of three comics (one Marvel, one DC, and one independent) that the Geeks choose during Previews episodes. They all read and discuss the issues. * Stump the Rios ‚Äì A trivia contest. Listeners submit three trivia questions, one for DC, one for Marvel, and one for Independent comics. If host, Peter Rios, cannot answer at least one of the three questions, the submitter will win a prize. The rules for Stump the Rios, came about because Peter was once asked three questions all about Scrooge McDuck, and so after this the rules were set that it had to be one Marvel, one DC, and one Independent Comic. Stump the Rios came to an end with Peter Rios leaving the show. * Top 5 ‚Äì Hosts list their five favorites in a variety of categories, such as animated movies, villains, and cliffhangers. * Smarty Pants ‚Äì The idea for a TV trivia contest featuring co-host Brian Christman was initiated by Matt when he coined the term \\"Iron the Pants,\\" the original name for the contest. Listeners submit three trivia questions dealing with American TV shows from the 1950s, 1960s and 1970s. Pants must successfully answer at least one question or he is considered \\"Ironed.\\" No prizes are awarded. The name of the contest was later changed to \\"Smarty Pants\\" to match the segment's theme music, \\"Smarty Pants\\" performed by First Choice. * Muddle The Murd ‚Äì This segment takes the place of \\"Stump The Rios\\" in regular rotation. Here, listeners submit three questions to try and defeat Adam Murdough. Each question must fit under the criteria of one DC, one Marvel and one Independent. The twist comes with the second set of criteria: one question must come from the Golden Age of comics (anytime before 1970), one from the Silver and Bronze Age (1970-2000), and finally, one from present day (2000-today). If Adam Murdough is unable to answer at least one question correctly he is considered \\"muddled,\\" and the contestant wins a prize. Spin- off podcasts The show has led to several spin-offs, including: * The Crisis Tapes - Hosted by Peter Rios and Adam Murdough. Each episode, the duo go in- depth, issue by issue, into DC's Crisis on Infinite Earths, and occasionally delve into its tie-in issues and related works. * Footnotes ‚Äì Where the hosts of CGS take an in-depth, page by page look at some classic comic series and discuss them. * World of Toys ‚Äì Hosted by Shane Kelly and Brian \\"Pants\\" Christman. A discussion of newly released toys as well as an in depth look at the toys of yesterday. * Murd's Time Bubble ‚Äì Hosted by Adam \\"Murd\\" Murdough. Being behind in his current comics reading by at least eight years, Murd discusses the comics that he is catching up on and his thoughts on the stories. * Jamie's Essentials ‚Äì Hosted by Jamie D. An extensive look at each Marvel character, their \\"must read\\" stories, and how they got to where they are now in current continuity. Convention tour Comic Geek Speak has had booths at several comic conventions around the United States, and has participated in panel discussions on podcasting. It was the official comics podcast for New York Comic Con in 2006, for Pittsburgh Comicon, and Fan Expo Canada in 2009. Super Show Comic Geek Speak held their first ever live recording in January 2006, to commemorate the show's 100th episode. The live recording was held at Golden Eagle Comics in Reading, Pennsylvania, which was also the site for the Episode 200 recording later that year. When the number of listeners showing up for these recordings outgrew what Golden Eagle could accommodate comfortably, Episode 300 moved to an unoccupied storefront inside the Fairgrounds Square Mall. This was the final milestone episode event held by Comic Geek Speak before switching to a convention model for their listener gatherings. In September 2008, Comic Geek Speak hosted the first Comic Geek Speak Super Show, a creator focused comic convention at the Greater Reading Expo Center in Reading, Pennsylvania. Notable guests included Mike Norton, Jamal Igle, David Petersen, Sal Abbinanti of Atomika, Buzz Aw, Morry Hollowell, Danielle Corsetto and many others.

The accident killed five people and injured 41 others. Eastbourne station is a terminus station with services to , , London Victoria. At the time of the accident, there was a further service to via the Cuckoo Line. It was then common for services from Hastings to Brighton to enter Eastbourne and reverse to carry on its journey. Trains between Ashford International and Brighton and between London Victoria and Ore still do this today, with some calling at twice.  The accident  On Monday, 25 August 1958, at 7:27 a.m., the 7:45 p.m. sleeper-car steam train originating from Glasgow \\"ran past the home signal at Eastbourne at danger.\\" A second train, the 6:47 a.m. multiple-unit, 12-coach, electric passenger train from Ore to London Bridge station, was at the number 4 platform at the Eastbourne station awaiting departure. The first train was carrying 36 passengers and the second 150 passengers. After passing the home signal, the steam train struck the EMU travelling at a speed of about 25 m.p.h. The 06:47 to service was about to depart Platform 4. Although scheduled to depart Eastbourne at 07:25, it was running four minutes late. The train had only started to leave when the 19:45 Glasgow to Eastbourne car sleeper service collided head on at about . The sleeper train had been running twelve minutes late on leaving Mitre Bridge Junction, London, where the locomotives are changed and had arrived at six minutes late. It left Polegate on time and on approaching Eastbourne was signal checked. Driver Alfred Wembridge failed to see the home signal was set at 'danger' and drove straight through the points, into the path of the oncoming London Bridge service.  Details  Composition of trains: * The 06:47 train from Ore to London Bridge was made of 12 coaches from two electric multiple units, formed by a 6PUL unit 3014 and a 6PAN unit 3032. * The 19:47 Glasgow to Eastbourne car sleeper consisted of 16 vehicles, two coaches, three sleeping cars, ten vans for luggage and motor cars and a guards van at the rear and was hauled by a Standard Class 5 4-6-0 tender engine, No. 73042. The official accident report stated that the front carriage of the London Bridge train telescoped onto the second coach, forcing both vehicles into the air and onto their sides. The leading coach struck a heavy signal gantry, causing it to collapse, landing away from the coaches. The underframe of the third coach was slightly bent. The steam locomotive derailed and the front end and smokebox were damaged but the leading coach was buffer locked with the tender, although some vans towards the rear of the sleeper train did suffer some damage by derailing and bent buffers. The only fatalities occurred in the London Bridge train. The motorman and three passengers were killed at the scene; the fourth passenger died later in hospital. A total of 40 people sustained injuries in the incident. The enquiry noted that there was heavy rain in the area leading up to the accident although at the time of the incident this was reduced to a light drizzle as reported by many members of staff. Driver Wembridge was acquitted of manslaughter at Sussex Assizes in December 1958.

Allason's 1823 plan for the development of the Ladbroke Estate, consisting of a large central circus with radiating streets and garden squares, or \\"paddocks\\". Thomas Allason (1790‚Äì1852) was an English architect, surveyor and landscaper, noted in particular for his work at Connaught Square and the Ladbroke Estate in Kensington. Early life Allason was born in London, England, in 1790. He studied architecture under William Atkinson (1774/5‚Äì1839), and won the silver medal of the Royal Academy School in 1809.page at British History Online Retrieved 17 January 2010. In 1814 Allason visited Greece. He claimed to have been the first to spot entasis on the shafts of Greek columns, although Charles Robert Cockerell (1788‚Äì1863) and Carl Haller von Hallerstein (1774‚Äì1817), whom Allason had met while in Athens, had also observed this.Thomas Allason at answers.com Retrieved 17 January 2010. Allason was a skilled draughtsman and in 1819 he published a series of engravings entitled Picturesque Views of the Antiquities of Pola in Istria. The plates themselves were engraved by WB. Cooke, George Cooke, Henry Moses, and Cosmo Armstrong. The book was published by John Murray in 1819.Picturesque Views of the Antiquities of Pola at amazon.co.uk Retrieved 17 January 2010. Architecture Few of Allason's buildings have survived into the modern era. Perhaps his most enduring legacy is his work on Connaught Square,The Gentleman's Magazine and Historical Review, Volume 221, p. 526 (1852). and on the Ladbroke Estate in Kensington, London. In 1821 James Weller Ladbroke inherited his family's then largely rural estate on the western edges of London, and soon set about planning its development. Ladbroke left the actual business of developing his land to the firm of City solicitors, Smith, Bayley (known as Bayley and Janson after 1836), who worked with Allason to develop the property. Allason's first task was to prepare a plan for the layout of the main portion of the estate, which was completed by 1823. The plan marks the genesis of his most enduring idea - the creation of large private communal gardens enclosed by terraces and/or crescents of houses. Allason's 1823 design was evidently inspired by the work of John Nash (1752-1835) at Regent's Park, and his vision was an ambitious one, consisting of a spectacular estate, focused on a large central circus with radiating streets built around central \\"paddocks\\" or garden squares. Allason's purpose was to combine the bucolic pleasures of the countryside with the urban amenities of the city.Moore, p. 8. However, the financial crisis of 1825 forced his plans to be greatly scaled down, and this original bold vision would never be fulfilled.Denny, p. 74. Nonetheless, eventually around fifteen of these communal garden squares would be built, and they continue to contribute to the unique character of Notting Hill to this day. Allason's own house in Linden Gardens (now demolished) was illustrated in John Claudius Loudon's Encyclopaedia of Cottage, Farm, and Villa Architecture (1846), and he designed a studio for the artist William Mulready (1786‚Äì1863) at Linden Grove, Bayswater, in 1827. Among his other architectural works was the Alliance Fire Office, Bartholomew Lane, London, demolished in 1841. He also oversaw the development of the Pitt Estate, Kensington, from 1844, designed Pyrgo Park, Romford, Essex, (built in 1851, and demolished by the local council in 1940), and was involved in the d'Este Estate, Ramsgate, Kent. His son, Thomas George Dickson Allason (d. 1868), was also an architect, and lived at 1 Connaught Square.Brodie, Antonia, p. 26, Directory of British Architects 1834-1914 British Architectural Library.

At that time, Spun Sugar was three for four lifetime. The win marked her first added-money stakes score, after winning a maiden and an allowance race prior to that start. The Black- Eyed Susan Stakes is considered by many to be the de facto second leg of the \\"Filly Triple Crown.\\" The Todd Pletcher trainee was sent to post as the favorite at odds of 1.20-1 odds at \\"Old-Hilltop\\" and won under jockey John Velazquez. She won going away by 3 3/4 lengths in 1:53 for the 1 1/8 mile distance over a sloppy track. R Lady Joy, a 5-1 shot, took second, while 7.50-1 shot Pleasant Chimes was another three lengths back in third. Spun Sugar paid $4.40 to win as the favorite.

Naya's natural spring water is bottled directly at this source, and it is untreated and non-ozonized, and naturally sodium-free. The name Naya comes from the word Naiads, who, in Greek mythology, were the goddesses of thermal waters and the immortal guardians of rivers, fountains and springs. Company history Naya‚Äôs founders searched for five years for a spring with specific qualities and found the Naya spring at the foot of the Laurentians in Mirabel, just north of Montreal. In 1986, the plant was built at the same location so that the water could be bottled as close to the spring as possible. Since August 1995, NAYA has also operated a water bottling facility in the Selkirk Mountains of Revelstoke, British Columbia, under the same strict standards as its Mirabel facilities. Naya spring The Naya spring is located in Mirabel, at the foot of the Laurentian mountains, which contain aquifers that have formed over millions of years. Naya water is drawn from an aquifer located at a depth of over 30 metres deep. Naya spring water is a natural and renewable resource.

Considered by some to be one of the most beautiful women of all time, she was ranked as the third greatest screen legend in American cinema by the American Film Institute. Hepburn is also remembered as both a film and style icon. Her debut was as a flight stewardess in the 1948 Dutch film Dutch in Seven Lessons. Hepburn then performed on the British stage as a chorus girl in the musicals High Button Shoes (1948), and Sauce Tartare (1949). Two years later she made her Broadway debut as the title character in the play Gigi. Hepburn's Hollywood debut as a runaway princess in William Wyler's Roman Holiday (1953) opposite Gregory Peck made her a star. For her performance she received the Academy Award for Best Actress, the BAFTA Award for Best British Actress, and the Golden Globe Award for Best Actress in a Motion Picture ‚Äì Drama. In 1954 she played a chauffeur's daughter caught in a love triangle in Billy Wilder's romantic comedy Sabrina opposite Humphrey Bogart and William Holden. In the same year Hepburn garnered the Tony Award for Best Actress in a Play for portraying the titular water nymph in the play Ondine. Her next role was as Natasha Rostova in the 1956 film adaptation of Leo Tolstoy's War and Peace. In 1957 Hepburn starred with Gary Cooper and Maurice Chevalier in Billy Wilder's Love in the Afternoon, and with Fred Astaire in the musical film Funny Face. Two years later she appeared in the romantic adventure film Green Mansions, and played a nun in The Nun's Story. In 1961, Hepburn played caf√© society girl Holly Golightly in the romantic comedy Breakfast at Tiffany's, and as a teacher accused of lesbianism in Wyler's drama The Children's Hour opposite Shirley MacLaine. Two years later she appeared opposite Cary Grant in the romantic mystery film Charade. Hepburn followed this by starring in the romantic comedy Paris When It Sizzles opposite William Holden, and as Cockney flower girl Eliza Doolittle in the musical film My Fair Lady (both in 1964). In 1967, she played a blind woman menaced by drug dealers in her own home in the suspense thriller Wait Until Dark which earned her a Best Actress Oscar nomination. Nine years later, Hepburn played Maid Marian opposite Sean Connery as Robin Hood in Robin and Marian. Her final film appearance was a cameo as an angel in Steven Spielberg's Always (1989).

Overview The base is in reserve status, its primary use being to store retired Agusta helicopters. Since 2009, it has been open to limited civilian recreational flying; it is home to a gliding club, operating on the weekends. History= Origins  Zutendaal Air Base's origins date to March 1917 when it was originally constructed by the German Army Air Corps as \\"Flieger Schie√üschule\\". it was established for observers destined for artillery units. Near this airfield, the Germans selected a large heath area (between Houthalen, Genk, As, Peer and Opglabbeek) where they installed a firing range. After World War I, the name of the airfield was changed to Asch (as it was spelled at the time) and it became the Flying School of the Belgian Military Aviation, later in March 1920 called A√©ronautique Militaire. Situated 2 km SW of the town centre of As, this school had a large 1100 by 800 metres grass airfield at its disposal and several metal hangars and brick support buildings. After the Flying School was abandoned in 1924, the airfield was closed to make room for the proposed construction of a canal, and moved to Wevelgem, the field gradually became a dense wooded area.  World War II  Temporary USAAF Buildings at Asch Airfield (Y-29) Belgium 1945 In November 1944 a new airfield near the World War I aerodrome was constructed by the United States Army Air Forces IX Engineer Command, 852nd and 846th Engineer Aviation Battalions. Known as Advanced Landing Ground \\"Y-29\\", the airfield consisted of a single 5000 foot (1500m) Sod runway aligned 06/24. In addition, tents were erected for billeting and also for support facilities; an access road was built to the existing road infrastructure; a dump was created for supplies, ammunition, and gasoline drums, along with a drinkable water; and a minimal electrical grid for communications and station lighting was installed. Asch was home to North American P-51 Mustangs of the 352nd Fighter Group, Eighth Air Force (which included the 328th Fighter Squadron, led by George Preddy); and P-47 Thunderbolts from 366th Fighter Group, Ninth Air Force, from 19 November 1944 ‚Äì 11 April 1945. The 406th Fighter Group, also flew from the airfield in P-47s from 8 February ‚Äì 15 April 1945. The fighter planes flew support missions, patrolling roads in front of the beachhead; strafing German military vehicles and dropping bombs on gun emplacements, anti-aircraft artillery and concentrations of German troops when spotted.Maurer, Maurer. Air Force Combat Units of World War II. Maxwell AFB, Alabama: Office of Air Force History, 1983. . On January 1, 1945, Asch airfield was the site of a major aerial battle during the Luftwaffe's Operation Bodenplatte. The FW-190's and Bf-109's of JG-11 arrived at Asch just as the 487th FS of the 352nd FG were rolling down the runway, the ensuing battle came to be known as the Legend of Y-29 and encapsulated the failure of Operation Bodenplatte as a whole. The pilots of the 487th Fighter Squadron who took off did so under fire and in the face of overwhelming odds. The 487th scored 23 kills while suffering only 2 damaged aircraft in the face of 3:1 odds. For their performance the 487th received the only Distinguished Unit Citation given to a fighter squadron in the European theatre. When the fighter units moved out, the 391st Bombardment Group flew B-26 Marauder medium bombers from the airfield until 27 May 1945. With the end of the war in Europe, the airfield was closed on 20 June 1945.  Belgian Air Force  After the war, the airfield was taken over by the Belgian Air Force. It was later rebuilt into a permanent facility with hard surfaced runways and support buildings. Currently it is used by the Belgian Army as a storage depot.Johnson, David C.

Based in Britain from 1905 until her death, Matters is best known for her work on behalf of the Women's Freedom League at the height of the militant struggle to enfranchise women in the United Kingdom. Early life Muriel Matters was born in the inner city suburb of Bowden in Adelaide, South Australia, to a large Methodist family. Her mother, Emma Alma Matters (n√©e Warburton), gave birth to five daughters and five sons, with Muriel being the third oldest child. Her father was John Leonard Matters, a cabinetmaker and later stockbroker. Matters spent the majority of her youth in South Australia. In 1894 the colony had gained attention for being the first self-governing territory to give women equal franchise on the same terms as it was granted to men, under legislation passed by the Kingston Government. During Matters' upbringing she was introduced to two 19th-century literary figures who proved influential in informing her political consciousness. These were the American poet Walt Whitman and the Norwegian playwright Henrik Ibsen, author of A Doll's House. While attending elocution classes as a child, the works of both of these writers featured prominently. Matters studied music at the University of Adelaide and by the late 1890s had begun to act and conduct recitals, initially in Adelaide, but later in Sydney and Melbourne with the Robert Brough Company.The Critic, 9 August 1905, p. 7. At the time of the Federation of Australia in 1901, Matters returned to Adelaide and taught elocution\\"Public Notices\\", The Advertiser, 8 June 1901, p, 2. while concurrently performing for audiences at numerous halls and saloons across the state.\\"Miss Muriel Matters Recital\\", The Advertiser, 30 August 1902, p. 8. In 1904, she left Adelaide once more to join her family who in the meantime had moved to Perth, Western Australia. In Perth she continued her acting and was encouraged by friends in the industry to further her career in London. She soon followed their advice and, in late 1905, aged 28, Matters boarded the passenger ship Persic to travel to London, England. Conversion to the suffrage cause When Matters arrived in London she began doing recitals intermittently and eventually performed at the Bechstein Hall (now named Wigmore Hall).\\"Bechstein Hall ‚Äì Miss Muriel Matters\\", The Times, 9 March 1907. However, recital work in London was difficult to acquire due to a surplus of performers and Matters undertook occasional work as a journalist for income. As a journalist she is known to have interviewed George Bernard Shaw and the exiled anarchist Prince Peter Kropotkin. Matters eventually performed at the home of Kropotkin and, after her recital, he challenged her to use her skills for something more useful stating that, \\"Art is not an end of life, but a means.\\"Mrs. Leonard W. Matters 1913, Australasians Who Count in London and Who Counts in Western Australia, Jas. Truscott & Son, Ltd., London, p. 163. Matters agreed with his assessment and soon became involved with the Women's Freedom League (WFL) to further the cause of women. She would later write that her encounter with Kropotkin, \\"proved to be the lifetime in a moment lived ‚Äì my entire mental outlook was changed.\\" WFL was led by Charlotte Despard and was set up to be more democratic than the Pankhursts led Women's Social and Political Union (WSPU) suffragettes. Matters accompanied Maud Arncliffe Sennet to an event where Milicent Fawcett was debating the support for women's militancy Arncliffe Sennett wrote in the press that Matters had not been forced into silence. Work with the Women's Freedom League= Caravan tour of 1908 In early May through to mid-October 1908, Matters was \\"Organiser in Charge\\" of the first \\"Votes for Women\\" caravan that toured the south east counties of England.Women's Freedom League 1908, Report for the Year 1908, London, p 13, held in the Suffragette Fellowship Collection, Museum of London. The caravan tour began in Oxshott and passed through Surrey, Sussex, East Anglia and Kent. The purpose of the tour was to speak about women's enfranchisement and establish new WFL branches in the region. Despite the occasional heckler, Matters and the others involved, such as Charlotte Despard and Amy Hicks, were successful in achieving these aims and established several branches. On this tour Matters met a young Quaker named Violet Tillard in Tunbridge Wells who remained a close acquaintance until Tillard's death in 1922, which was due to typhus contracted while helping people in famine-ravaged Russia. Grille incident On the night of 28 October 1908, the WFL conducted a simultaneous protest at the British Houses of Parliament. It was to occur outside St Stephen's Entrance, the Old Prison Yard and in the House of Commons. The purpose of the protest was to raise attention to the struggle of women and remove the \\"grille\\", a piece of ironwork placed in the Ladies' Gallery that obscured their view of parliamentary proceedings.Women's Freedom League 1908, Report for the Year 1908, London, p 10, held in the Suffragette Fellowship Collection, Museum of London. Matters was at the heart of the protest at this symbol of women's oppression. She and an associate, Helen Fox, both chained themselves to the grille of the Ladies' Gallery and Matters began loudly proclaiming the benefits of enfranchisement directly to the elected MPs. Although not recorded in Hansard, the official minute of the House of Commons, Matters pronouncements were technically the first woman's speech ever in the British Parliament. Meanwhile, Violet Tillard lowered a proclamation to the politicians below using pieces of string and a man from the Stranger's Gallery threw handbills onto the floor of Parliament. The police soon seized all the people involved but could not separate Matters and Fox from the grille. Eventually the grille was removed completely with the women attached and, once escorted to a nearby committee room, a blacksmith was fetched to detach the women from the ironwork. Not charged over the incident, Matters and the other women involved were soon released near St Stephen's Entrance where they rejoined other members of the WFL who were still protesting. It was here that Matters was arrested on a \\"trumped-up charge of obstruction\\" trying to rush the Parliament's lobby.Mrs. Leonard W. Matters 1913, Australasians Who Count in London and Who Counts in Western Australia, Jas. Truscott & Son, Ltd., London, p. 164. The following day, 14 women (including Matters) and one man were tried at the Westminster Police Court. Matters was found guilty of wilfully obstructing London Police and was sentenced to one months imprisonment to be served at Holloway Gaol.\\"Woman Suffrage ‚Äì The Disorder at Westminster\\", The Times, 30 October 1908, p. 9.

To gain attention and to promote the suffrage cause, Matters decided to hire a small dirigible airship (similar to a modern-day blimp in appearance) and intended to shower the King and the Houses of Parliament with WFL pamphlets.Tries Balloon Campaign\\", The New York Times. However, due to adverse wind conditions and the rudimentary motor powering the airship, she never made it to the Palace of Westminster. Instead, Matters, beginning at Hendon airfields, hugged the outskirts of London flying over Wormwood Scrubs, Kensington, Tooting and finally landing in Coulsdon with the trip lasting an hour and a half in total.The Times, 17 February 1909, p. 10. With the airship emblazoned with \\"Votes for Women\\" on one side and \\"Women's Freedom League\\" on the other, it rose to a height of . Matters scattered of handbills promoting the WFL's cause and leading members of the league, Edith How-Martyn and Elsie Craig, pursued her by car. Her flight made headlines around the world. 1910: First lecture tour of Australia Before sailing to Australia, Matters and fellow suffragette Violet Tillard, helped the Women's Freedom League campaign in Liverpool from January to April 1901. From May to July 1910, Matters gave lectures focused on her experiences in Britain agitating for change. In the four-month tour, she spoke in Perth (Literary Hall), Adelaide (Town Hall), Melbourne (Princess Theatre) and Sydney (King's Hall). Giving three talks in each city she advocated for prison reform, equal pay for equal work and for the vote to be granted to the women of Great Britain.\\"Address by Miss Muriel Matters\\", The Advertiser, 1 August 1910, p. 9. Accompanied by Violet Tillard on the tour, Matters presented the audience with illustrations related to the movement and donned a facsimile of her prison dress. From the newspaper reports surrounding her visit it is evident that she played to sizeable audiences and that her performances were littered with laughter and applause.\\"Through Women's Eyes\\", The Register, 13 June 1910, p. 10. At the conclusion of the lecture tour, Matters helped Vida Goldstein secure an Australian Senate resolution that outlined the country's positive experiences with women's suffrage.D.S., \\"Australian Women in Politics: An Interview with Miss Muriel Matters\\", The British Australasian, 9 February 1911, p. 9. The resolution was passed and sent to Prime Minister Asquith in Britain. Work in East London Within a year of Matters' return from her country of origin, she became involved with the \\"Mothers Arms\\" project in East London led by Sylvia Pankhurst. Matters and other concerned women worked with poor children and mothers residing in the slums of Lambeth, London. With the help of others, she educated impoverished children in the Montessori method in addition to feeding and clothing them. During 1913 Matters ensured that the male dominated National Federation of Mineworkers came to support women's suffrage. Marriage In September 1913, Matters became engaged to marry William Arnold Porter, a divorced Bostonian dentist, at the fourth time of asking. In those days it was controversial to marry a divorcee, and rumour was he had left his wife for her. The couple married on 15 October 1914. She subsequently became known as Muriel Matters-Porter. The couple did not have children. Objection to the First World War In June 1915, one year after the outbreak of World War I, Matters declared her opposition to the war in an address entitled \\"The False Mysticism of War\\".Matters, Muriel 1915, The False Mysticism of War, Headly Bros., London. In essence, she argued that war is not a successful problem solving mechanism and justifications for war are based on false pretences. She expressed her displeasure at Christianity being used as a justification of war as the origins of the faith made no appeal to armed force. For Matters, those advocating war in government along theological lines could not be trusted, \\"For their god is in their own consciousness, a magnified edition of themselves.\\"Matters, Muriel 1915, The False Mysticism of War, Headly Bros., London, p. 5. Furthermore, in her address she provides a rebuttal of the militaristic arguments presented in the book War and the World's Life by Colonel Frederic Natusch Maude. Matters also questioned the importance of nationality ‚Äì the rise of which being a central factor in the outbreak of the war she was denouncing. With the newspapers of the day filled with honour rolls of dead soldiers and advertisements to purchase war bonds, her arguments were in conflict with a society engaged in total war. The address was later reproduced in the form of a pamphlet by the anti-war Peace Committee of the Society of Friends (Quakers) and sold for a small fee. Montessori method In 1916, Matters spent a year in Barcelona attending the Italian educator Maria Montessori's international course which focused on new educational strategies, looking at the whole child's development: physical, social, emotional and cognitive.\\"The Child Mind\\", The Argus, 6 October 1922, p. 12. Spain's neutrality during the Great War allowed Matters to go there to study the child-centred approach to learning taught by Montessori, which fitted her view that education should be a universal right. On her return to England she resumed work with the poor children of East London and, on occasion, was invited to lecture education students in England and Scotland on the merits of the Montessori method. 1922: Second lecture tour of Australia In 1922, Matters undertook a second lecture tour of Australia but this time her primary concern was to advocate Montessori's ideas to the educators of her native country. Giving lectures in Perth, Sydney, Adelaide and Melbourne, her tour was closely followed by the Australian press. Candidate for Hastings Returning to the UK, Matters was selected to run as the Labour Party candidate for the seat of Hastings in the General Election of 1924.\\"Parliamentary Candidates\\", The Times, 21 August 1924, p. 7. Her opponent was the incumbent Conservative candidate, Lord Eustace Percy. She ran on a largely socialist platform advocating a fairer distribution of wealth, work for the unemployed and furthering the equality of the sexes.\\"Election Notes and News\\", The Hastings Observer, 28 October 1924. During the election, Muriel's younger brother, Leonard Matters, joined her on the campaign. Leonard's experience as a writer and journalist would have been invaluable in negotiating the hostile Hastings press (Leonard himself would later become the Member for Lambeth in 1929).\\"India: Service in Cause of Freedom\\", The Hindu, 31 October 1957. Despite the Matters‚Äô best efforts, Lord Eustace Percy was returned with an increased majority of 9,135 which echoed the Conservative gains across the country. Hastings would remain a safe Conservative seat and was not claimed by a Labour Party candidate until 1997.\\"Muriel Matters: Former Suffragette who Wanted to be Hastings MP\\", <> Later life and death Speaking in 1928 to voters In the years after the election, Matters settled in Hastings with her husband. It was 1928, when a fifty-one-year-old Matters finally achieved what she and other women of Great Britain were seeking - equal suffrage for women compared to men (partial suffrage had been granted to women in 1918). In her later years, Matters often wrote letters to the editor of newspapers, frequented the local library and was heavily involved in the Hastings community. Controversial to the end, she was locally reported as seen 'skinny dipping' at Pelham Beach. Widowed in 1949, Matters died 21 years later on 17 November 1969, aged 92, at the St Leonards on Sea nursing home.Hastings Observer, 22 November 1969.  Recognition  Matters was not given the same recognition in Australia as in the UK, where she was interviewed by the BBC in 1939. But in 2009 the Muriel Matters Society was set up. In 2013, a docu-drama called Muriel Matters! was presented at the Adelaide Film Festival and on ABC TV. In 2018 a street mural of Matters appeared in Adelaide and an article about her linked the battles she fought to the #MeToo movement.

He played representative level rugby union (RU) for the British Isles, and England, and at club level for Gloucester, and Halifax, as a forward, or wing, and club level rugby league (RL) for Halifax (Heritage No. 9), as a forward. Rugby career Jackson was born in Gloucester, Gloucestershire, and he died aged 88 in Halifax, West Riding of Yorkshire. Rugby career Jackson first came to note as a rugby player while representing Gloucester. In 1891 Jackson accepted an invitation to join the British Isles on their tour to South Africa, the first official tour by the team that later became the British Lions. It is unknown if Jackson joined the tour party late, was unwell or just not chosen to play, but he missed the first four matches of the tour, not playing until the team faced Griqualand West at Kimberley on Monday 20 July 1891. From there he played in four of the next six games though missing the First Test against South Africa. His last match of the tour was against a King William's Town & District team, played on 6 August, despite there being a further 11 matches remaining. On returning to Britain Jackson continued playing rugby, but between 1891 and 1894, switched from Gloucester to Halifax, who were at the time still a rugby union club. It was while representing Halifax that Jackson was selected for his one and only appearance for the England national team. Played away against Scotland, Jackson was brought into the England team for the last match of the 1894 Home Nations Championship, but after playing in the pack for the British Isles, was placed on the wing for England. The match ended in defeat for England, their first loss in five visits to Scotland; and the English selectors reacted by never selecting nine of the England players again, Jackson being one of them. Change of Code When Halifax converted from the rugby union code to the rugby league code on Thursday 29 August 1895, Walter Jesse Jackson would have been approximately 25 years of age. Consequently, he became both a rugby union, and rugby league footballer for Halifax.

Wood declared his followers \\"modern Israelites,\\" and the group practiced a strict dietary code as they understood to be instructed in the Law of Moses. Like most radical sects, the group displayed spiritual gifts and made prophecies. At one point the group begin building a temple, although the project was eventually abandoned. History Nathaniel Wood formed the New Israelites in Middletown, Rutland County, Vermont at the end of the 1790s. Originally a Congregationalist, Wood was excommunicated in 1789, after which he began to preach to small meetings whose attendees were mostly family and relatives. The sect may have been influenced by the Newent Separates of Norwich, who believed in perfectionist immortalism and spiritual wifery, and the preaching of Rev. Joel Benedict, who taught that Hebrew was the angelic tongue.. The sect claimed literal descent from the Ten Lost Tribes of Israel, and they practiced divination and polygamy.; ; . After the sect was joined by a counterfeiter and treasure seer named \\"Winchell\\" (probably Justus WinchellQuinn argues that the Winchell referred to is Justus Winchell, born 1755. . Another possibility could be his first cousin Nathaniel Winchell.) in the spring or early summer of 1800, the New Israelites began dowsing to look for buried treasure in Middletown and Rutland, Vermont. They also embarked on the construction of a temple. The group employed the divining rod for both treasure hunting and other forms of revelation. It was suspected that these efforts masked a counterfeiting operation. Wood predicted the arrival of a \\"Destroying Angel\\" on 14 January 1802 that would bring down plagues and earthquakes upon the \\"gentiles.\\" On 14 January 1802, the day that Wood said would be the commencement of the Apocalypse, as the sect gathered together to await the arrival of the \\"destroying angel\\", the locals were so alarmed that on the night in question the militia was called out. The militia then fired their weapons to disperse this \\"Fraternity of Rodsmen\\".(; ; . This event was subsequently known as the \\"Wood Scrape.\\" After the Wood Scrape, Wood and his family moved to Ellisburg, New York, and the sect became extinct. Possible connection to Mormonism Members of the New Israelites may have included Joseph Smith, Sr., the father of the Mormon prophet, and William Cowdery, father of Book of Mormon witness Oliver Cowdery. The best case exists for connecting Cowdery family, as they are known to have lived near the Woods in the early 19th century, and later attended a Congregationalist church in Poultney, Vermont after the Wood Scrape. Oliver Cowdery, who was not born at the time of the Wood Scrape, was later known as a dowser, and was the second highest ranking early leader of the Latter Day Saint movement, next to Joseph Smith, Jr. Witnesses from Vermont connected William Cowdery to the sect, before these witnesses could have known from media reports that his son Oliver was a dowser.; Vermont residents who were interviewed by a local historian said that Joseph Smith, Sr. was also part of the New Israelites, and was one of its \\"leading rods-men\\".; . However, there is no historical consensus linking Smith to the New Israelites because of the difficulty in placing Joseph Smith, Sr. in Rutland County, Vermont during that time period. Although residents said that he lived in Poultney, Vermont \\"at the time of the Wood movement here\\",; . there are no other records placing Smith closer than about 50 miles away. On the other hand, Smith's involvement with the New Israelites would be consistent with his links to Congregationalism and his reported admission in 1837 that he entered the money digging business \\"more than thirty years\\" ago.. James C. Brewster claimed that in 1837, Smith, Sr. boasted that \\"I know more about money-digging than any man in this generation for I have been in the business for more than thirty years!\\" NotesReferences *. *. *. *.

He has also written novels, plays and drama series (for both television and radio). Life and career Dick Sharples was born in Manchester.Born in Manchester https://www.amazon.co.uk/dp/1434301192 Information taken from the cover of his book Getting Even Retrieved 5 October 2009 He began his career as a cartoonist and a writer for a Manchester Advertising Agency.Early Career https://www.scribd.com/doc/5302191/Testy Interview. Retrieved 5 October 2009 One of the agency's customers was comedian Al Read who ran a meat pie company called H. Read and Son. Sharples wrote the tagline \\"potatoes and meat, simply heat\\" for the company's fritters. A chance meeting with a local, jobbing printer called Archie Carmichael led to Sharples writing his first novel whilst still a teenager. The Man Who Rode By Night was a 40,000-word Western, and led to Sharples being paid 21 shillings for every thousand words. One of Sharples' first television writing credits was for the 1956 ATV series Joan and Leslie, starring Harry Towb and Noel Dyson. Other early television work included writing episodes of soap opera Compact, drama series The Saint, and Dixon of Dock Green. Early screenplays included collaborating with Gerald Kelsey (one of the Joan and Leslie co-writers) on the 1961 comedy film The Golden Rabbit which starred Willoughby Goddard. Up to now, Sharples had concentrated on delivering scripts for other peoples' series. This was, however, soon to change. In 1969 Sharples wrote a one-off comedy episode called In Loving Memory. Broadcast on 4 November 1969, the story was based in a rural Yorkshire undertakers. It starred Edward Chapman as Jeremiah Unsworth, and Marjorie Rhodes as his wife Ivy. Also cast was Christopher Beeny as Ivy's slightly silly nephew. Almost ten years later, the Unsworths returned to television in a seven part series. Christopher Beeny returned to the role of nephew Billy, but the other roles were re-cast. Thora Hird took on the role of Ivy, whilst Freddie Jones played Jeremiah. The first episode of the series was broadcast on 21 May 1979 and ran for five series, the final episode being broadcast on 27 March 1986. In the long gap between the pilot and the first series, Sharples worked on many other series, including a four-year stint as script editor on the UK version of General Hospital. Sharples had proved himself as a writer who could carry a long- running series, so it was inevitable that further shows would follow. In 1981, Sharples penned another Thora Hird comedy vehicle called Hallelujah!. Running for two series, it was set in a Northern branch of the Salvation Army and co- starred Patsy Rowlands. With In Loving Memory coming to an end, Sharples turned to writing Farrington of the F.O., a sitcom starring Angela Thorne as the eponymous Farrington. Set in a British consulate in an unidentified Latin American country, the series co-starred Joan Sims who had made several guest appearances for Sharples in In Loving Memory. For the second series, the title was modified to simply Farrington, and the show came to an end after 14 episodes. On 19 October 2015, he died at the age of 88. Later career After writing a 1990 episode of the Thames Television series The Bill, Sharples was contacted by Belgische Radio en Televisie about their proposed re-make of In Loving Memory. Renamed R.I.P., many episodes followed the original Sharples storylines, and the series ran from 1992 to 1994. Also in 1990, Sharples published another novel Soap in the Afternoon: The Secret Life of Angie St. Clair, Night Nurse Extraordinary, followed by Getting Even: The Biggest Heist in History in 2007, which is hoped to be made into a major movie. Sharples has written other novels, \\"Idunno Jenkins and the River of No return\\", and \\"Village in Aspic\\" (Both were published as ebooks in 2012), along with the autobiographical \\"I Found the Time\\" and \\"Situation Tragedy\\" (Both from 2012).

The film won two Filmfare South awards for Best Male Playback Singer and Best Lyricist. Plot A remote village named Pali in Andhra Pradesh is struck by an unknown disease, with several villagers dying each month. The village Tantrik predicts a powerful man will come to their rescue as God. He assigns his assistant Siddhappa with the duty to find a man with such supernatural power and bring him to their village. Meanwhile, Alluri Seetarama Raju is a cab driver who lives in Hyderabad with his grandfather, a teacher. He is currently in Rajasthan in search of the family of a man named Bilavar Singh. In his journey, he meets a Gemini TV reporter named Baabji, who comes to Rajasthan to shoot a travel documentary. Raju introduces himself to Baabji and tells him the reason for him being in Rajasthan. He describes a woman named Subhashini, whom he considers brings bad luck to him. Previously, he encountered her in various occasions in which she damages his taxi due to her reckless driving. Raju lands in the hospital one day when Subhashini mixes an epsom salt laxative in Raju's coffee (intended for someone else), thinking that it meets her at a coffee shop to collect the compensation for his taxi's damages from her. For this reason, Raju considers Subhashini bad luck. One day, Raju drives two men, geology scientist Dr. Paranji and his assistant Bilavar to their destination the Geological Survey of India. However, he sees them getting gunned down by some henchmen, and Bilavar falls out of a window and lands on Raju's taxi, destroying it. Since Bilavar has insurance, Raju's boss tells him to deliver the insurance check of Rs. 5,00,000 to Bilavar's family in Girdwala, Rajasthan and get Rs. 1,00,000 in return to pay for his car damages. Meanwhile, Subhashini's father, business magnate Durga Prasad, brings her a match, the son of another business magnate named GK. The main reason for the proposal is to establish a strong business partnership. GK's son takes Subhashini to Rajasthan for a date. However, Subhashini runs away after she sees a condom drop from GK's son's pocket, and only then does she begin to realize his true intentions. GK finds out about it, informs Prasad, and promises to bring Subhashini back. He sends his henchman Govardhan to Rajasthan in search of Subhashini. To Raju's dismay, Subhashini finds him and Baabji and learns that she is in Rajasthan. Subhashini, Baabji, Raju, and a botanist named Tom Cruise find Girdwala and hand the check to Bilavar's family, but Raju refuses to ask for the Rs. 1,00,000 when he sees the family's poverty. Tom remains in the village as the villagers want to punish him for cutting a sentimental plant. Baabji goes away with his shooting team but does not offer them a ride as he is scared of Subhashini's reckless behavior. As Raju and Subhashini return, Govardhan's men stab Raju and take Subhashini after knocking her unconscious. However, Raju survives, fights, and kills almost all of Govardhan's men, while Govardhan himself escapes from the scenario, leaving Subhashini behind. Just as Raju goes unconscious, Sidhappa finds him and believes that he is the God after seeing the omens. Sidhappa and Subhashini take Raju to Pali, where the villagers treat his wounds. After waking up, he finds all of the villagers praising him as their God. He finds out from Subhashini that they are in Pali and that the villagers see him as the supernatural godsend that the Tantrik was describing about and who will rescue the village. Initially reluctant to help them out, Raju escapes to Hyderabad, where he hands over Subhashini to her father. After realizing that Tom and Siddappa followed him to Hyderabad, Raju puts fate to the test, and when he understands the concept of deityhood and God, he makes it a goal to solve the mystical series of deaths in the village. After tracking down a doctor (who works for GK), the dean of the medical college run by GK (who set up the medical camp in Pali), Govardhan, and GK's lawyer Miriyam Raju discovers that the plastic factory in Pali deposits its wastes in the drinking water source nearby, thus contaminating and killing the villagers. While Tom and Siddappa think that this is the end of the story, Raju suspects that there is more to the story, that so many villagers are dying due to the plastic factory waste that is being contaminated with drinking water. It is revealed that GK actually wants the villagers in Pali to die, which was why he had the government's medical camp removed periodically. Raju finds GK's assistant and suspects she has something to do with GK's plan as she did not get into his taxi along with Paranji, indicating that she knew beforehand that he was going to be killed. Raju inquires her about GK's intentions, who reveals that Paranji discovered earlier that there is a large iridium deposit under Pali, which is worth billions, and informed GK about it. Despite GK's warning to Paranji of not revealing it to anybody else, Praranji tries to inform the Geological Survey of India about the deposits, which was why he and Bilavar, who was with him, were killed that day. GK suspects that Raju might also know about the iridium deposit because he was with Paranji when he was killed, which was why GK sent Govardhan to kill him, not to retrieve Subhashini. Raju was lured to Girdwala under the cover of delivering the insurance check to Bilavar's family (GK had the insurance documents planted) and was attacked by Govardhan. GK needs the strong plastic glass from the plastic factory to pack the iridium. He wanted the Pali villagers to vacate (to dig the iridium ore without trouble) on their own to avoid suspicion, which was why he poisoned Pali's environment using the plastic factory's waste. GK kills his assistant and Govardhan for their failures. He then heads to Pali to kill all the villagers before the truth goes out to the public. The village head warns GK that Raju is their God, that he would bring death to GK, and keep Pali's population at 534, not letting any more die in the process. Raju arrives at Pali along with Sidhappa. GK immediately shoots and kills Sidhappa, reducing the population to 533. Before dying, Siddhappa looks into Raju's eyes, then dying after. Eventually, Raju kills GK's goons and severs GK's palm. A terrified GK starts escaping with Raju in pursuit. Raju catches up to him, and GK dies when a religious knife hanging from a nearby tree falls and stabs him in the neck after Raju curses him to die. The village head reveals that Raju fulfilled his mission as God to save the village because although Sidhappa was killed, another baby was born to keep the village's population at 534. The film ends with a new flag being put up in honor of the new birth.

Soundtrack=Critical reception Sify rated 3 out of 5 explained \\"No doubt, Mahesh is the cynosure of the movie, shouldering the entire responsibility.\\" MSN rated 3 out of 5 and described the film as \\"just an above average venture\\", commenting, \\"Mahesh Khaleja is worth a watch for Mahesh's strong screen presence and charisma. Mahesh carries off his role with elan and looks superb too. Anushka looks pretty but doesn't share a good on-screen chemistry with Mahesh. The first half of the film is dull. It does pick up pace in the second half but the narration is inconsistent and tedious. The climax is little better. Rediff gave a 3 out of 5 rating and noted \\"The duo of Mahesh-Trivikram delivers a product that is watchable, entertaining with good humour, couple of well-orchestrated action sequences and songs and with a bit to take home as well. It's Mahesh's show all the way, much to the delight of his fans. Mahesh is the soul of the movie, be it his dialogue delivery, his action, his dances or emotions, he is effortless. CNN-IBN gave a mixed review stating \\"The movie is all about Mahesh Babu and he occupies almost every frame in the movie. Back after a gap of 4 years, Mahesh looks great with stylish costumes. The movie deals with a serious theme but director Trivikram Srinivas mixes it with a lot of unnecessary situational comedy which dilutes the intensity of the movie.\\" Awards ;Filmfare Awards South ;;Won: * Best Lyricist ‚Äì Telugu: Ramajogayya Sastry ‚Äì \\"Sada Siva\\" * Best Male Playback Singer ‚Äì Telugu: Ramesh Vinayagam & N.

The castle was built in the early 12th century as a timber ringwork following the Norman invasion of Wales. The walls were rebuilt in stone by the Braose family at the turn of the 13th and 14th centuries, including a stone gatehouse. Soon afterwards, however, encroaching sand dunes caused the site to be abandoned and it fell into ruin. Restoration work was carried out during the course of the 20th century and the remains of the castle are now protected under UK law as a Grade II* listed building. History=13th-14th centuries Plan of the castle in the 14th century; A - West mural tower; B - North-west mural tower; C - hall; D - gatehouse The Normans began to make incursions into South Wales from the late-1060s onwards, pushing westwards from their bases in recently occupied England. Their advance was marked by the construction of castles and the creation of regional lordships.; Pennard Castle was built at the start of the 12th century after Henry de Beaumont, the Earl of Warwick, conquered the Gower Peninsula and made Pennard one of his demesne manors. The castle was constructed on a limestone spur, overlooking the mouth of the Pennard Pill stream and Three Cliffs Bay, and was protected to the north and west by surrounding cliffs.; The fortification initially took the form of an oval-shaped ringwork, , with a defensive ditch and ramparts around the outside, and a timber hall in the centre. A local church, St Mary's, was built just to the east and a settlement grew up around the site; a rabbit warren was established in the nearby sand dunes. In the early 13th century, a simple stone hall, approximately , was built on the site of the older timber building, using red-purple sandstone with white limestone detailing.; Around the turn of the 13th and 14th centuries, while the castle was controlled by William and his son, also called William, the timber defences were replaced. A thin stone curtain wall, approximately tall with battlements, replaced the palisades, with the mural defences including a square tower on a rocky spur on the west side, and a circular tower on the north-west corner. A gatehouse was built as the new entrance, with two half-circular towers that possibly imitated those of regional castles such as Caerphilly; it was weakly defended by a portcullis and a handful of arrow loops.; The new walls were built from a mixture of red sandstone rubble, probably quarried locally, and limestone dug from the castle site itself.; The Braoses may have rebuilt Pennard as a replacement for their castle at nearby Penmaen which was abandoned at around the same time due to encroaching sand dunes.; 16th-21st centuries A depiction of the castle from the north-east in 1741 Pennard Castle also began to suffer from sand dune encroachment and the castle and its settlement were gradually abandoned. A survey in 1650 described the fortification as being \\"desolate and ruinous\\" and surrounded by sand. By 1741, the castle's south wall had mostly collapsed but the remainder of the castle was apparently still generally intact, although it had suffered further losses by 1795. It was a popular subject for engravings, sketches and paintings from the 18th century onwards, with the view of the ruins from the east proving particularly popular. By 1879, large cracks had appeared in the southern tower of the gatehouse, which led to its partial collapse. By 1922, concerns had grown about the condition of the castle and discussions took place between the Penard Golf Club, who owned the site, the Royal Institution and the Cambrian Archaeological Association. A joint committee was formed to raise the funds for repairs to the stonework but the costs appear to have been excessive and instead the gatehouse was patched with concrete between 1923 and 1924. Much of the remaining southern wall collapsed at the beginning of 1960 and an archaeological survey was conducted between 1960 and 1961. Urgent masonry repairs were then carried out in 1963, paid for by a combination of the Ministry of Public Buildings and Works, the Gower Society, the golf club and a public appeal launched by local newspapers. The castle seen from the west, with the golf course visible beyond In the 21st century, the ruins of the gatehouse still survive, reaching up to the battlements on its east side, partially because it was built with very strong mortar. Parts of the curtain wall survive, mainly on the north and east sides, now around thick and averaging tall, along with the remains of the square mural tower. The ruins are protected under UK law as a grade II* listed building and a scheduled ancient monument.

Life He was son of Isaac Parsons, butler of Corpus Christi College, Oxford, and his wife Alice; born in the parish of St Aldate's, Oxford, he was baptised in St Aldate's Church on 6 July 1761. He received his early education, first at the school attached to Christ Church, Oxford, and subsequently at Magdalen College School. In his 16th year, he was admitted to Wadham College on 26 June 1777, and was elected a scholar of the college on 30 June 1780. He graduated BA in 1782, and MA in 1785. His other degrees were BD and D.D., both in 1799. He was elected Fellow of Balliol College on 29 November 1785, and in July 1797 was presented by the college to the united livings of All Saints and St Leonard's, Colchester. On 14 November 1798, he was elected Master of Balliol, an office he held till his death. From 1807 to 1810, he was Vice-Chancellor of Oxford University. An academic reformer, he made college examination a reality, and in conjunction with John Eveleigh, Provost of Oriel College he gave a lead to the University, elaborating the examination Statute of 1801, by which university honours were for the first time awarded for real merit; and he was one of the first examiners, the earliest class list under the new system appearing in 1802. He was for many years a leading member of the Hebdomadal board. Richard Jenkyns, who succeeded him as Master, was tutor under him, and when Parsons was made a bishop was appointed Vice-Master, seconding his administration of the College. In national politics, he was a strong Tory, firmly opposed to Catholic emancipation. He was the senior of the three heads of houses who, on the death of William Cavendish-Bentinck, 3rd Duke of Portland in 1809, proposed John Scott, 1st Earl of Eldon for the chancellorship of the university, to which William Grenville, 1st Baron Grenville was elected. In 1810, he was appointed to the deanery of Bristol, and in 1812 he was presented to the chapter living of Weare in Somerset, which he held in commendam till his death. In 1813, he was raised to the bishopric of Peterborough, on the death of Spencer Madan, helped by the influence of Lord Eldon. He supported the National Society for the Education of the Poor, with Provost Eveleigh; and Parsons, together with Joshua Watson, is credited with drawing up in 1812 the terms of union for the district committees of the provincial schools. In the House of Lords he seldom spoke, but was active on committees. He died at Oxford on 12 March 1819, and was buried in the chapel of Balliol College, where a monument was erected. Works Only two of his sermons were printed; all his manuscript sermons were burnt after his death, by his express desire. In the acrimonious controversy concerning the 1784 Bampton Lectures of Joseph White, the Arabic professor, of which Samuel Badcock was asserted to have been the author, and portions of which were claimed by Samuel Parr, Parsons was appointed one of the arbitrators, but declined to act; and it was believed that he also had a share in the lectures, as Parr knew. Family On 22 January 1798, Parsons married Elizabeth Parsons, probably a cousin, at St Aldates church. He left no children by his wife, who survived him.

He was charged with the theft of hundreds of thousands of dollars in property, including several small aircraft, boats, and multiple cars, all committed while still a teenager. He fled to the Bahamas on July 4, 2010, allegedly in a plane stolen from Bloomington, Indiana. He was indicted on July 6, 2010, by a U.S. Federal Court in Seattle, Washington, on charges of transporting another stolen aircraft in that state. Moore, still only 19, was arrested in Harbour Island, Bahamas, on July 11, 2010, after police shot out the engine of the boat in which he was attempting to flee. Two days later, he was extradited from Nassau, Bahamas, to Miami, Florida, and transferred on July 21 to the Federal Detention Center, SeaTac in Washington. On December 16, 2011, Moore was sentenced to more than seven years in prison for dozens of consolidated charges brought against him from three different counties. On January 27, 2012, he was sentenced to six and a half years for related federal crimes. He became known as the \\"Barefoot Bandit\\" by reportedly committing some of his crimes barefoot, once leaving behind 39 chalk footprints and the word \\"c'ya!\\". Despite the widely reported nickname, officials said that he more often wore shoes. On September 28, 2016, Moore was released from prison on parole.  Background  Moore was born in Mount Vernon, Washington and grew up in his mother's house in Camano Island. Colton Harris Moore Psychiatric Evaluation by Richard S. Adler M.D. Documentcloud.com Neighbors said they made several calls to Child Protective Services, believing he was neglected or abused. His father, Gordon Moore, used drugs and was in prison while Colton was a toddler. When Colton was twelve years old, his father walked out after an argument at a family barbecue. According to his mother, Pamela Kohler, his stepfather died when he was about seven years old, and from the time Colton was in the first grade, she knew there was \\"something off about him\\" - \\"sort of a disconnection\\". He wouldn't listen to his teachers, started altercations at school, and would sometimes deliberately break things around the house, Kohler said. According to a court-ordered psychiatric evaluation, Moore said that his mother drank and became mean, breaking his possessions. He started living in the wild at the age of seven, and would break into vacation homes in the area, stealing blankets, food and water before disappearing into the forest for days. His first conviction for stolen property came at age 12, and by the time he was 13, he had three more. He has been diagnosed with depression, attention deficit disorder and intermittent explosive disorder. Each conviction brought a 10-day stay in a detention center, or community service. His mother once said, \\"Every time he had anything any good, everyone thought he stole it. What does that do to a kid?\\" In 2003, police found a neighbor's camcorder in his home. Never before sentenced to more than a month, he fled a three-year sentence by walking out of a halfway house in April 2008. Suspected offenses Moore is suspected of being responsible for approximately 100 thefts in Washington, Idaho, and Canada, including bicycles, automobiles, light aircraft, and speedboats. It is believed that he learned how to fly small planes by reading aircraft manuals, handbooks, watching a \\"How to fly a small airplane\\" DVD, and playing flight simulator computer games. One plane he stole was a Cessna 182, FAA registration number N24658, belonging to then KZOK-FM radio personality Bob Rivers, valued at over $150,000. The plane was later recovered from a Yakama Indian Reservation crash site. Though badly damaged, it was rebuilt and is in Florida. According to local sheriffs, Moore would often slip into a home just to soak in a hot bath or steal ice cream from the freezer. While his thefts would escalate to increasing value in cash and property, he initially would steal only what he needed for living in the woods as a survivalist. Once, he allegedly used a homeowner's computer and credit card to order bear mace and a pair of $6,500 night vision goggles. On May 30 or 31, 2010, police found a handwritten note and $100 at a veterinary clinic in Raymond, Washington, approximately southwest of Seattle. The note read: In late June 2010, Moore was suspected of vehicle thefts stretching as far east as Illinois. The trail of suspected thefts attributed to him passes through Idaho, South Dakota, Nebraska, Iowa, and Illinois. Police found a 2008 white Toyota Sequoia in Norfolk, Nebraska, which was reported stolen in Yankton, South Dakota. Later that day, several burglaries were reported at Karl Stefan Memorial Airport, located south of where the SUV was abandoned. A truck owned by the town of Ottumwa, Iowa, was later recovered in Dallas City, Illinois. On July 4, 2010, a Cessna 400 single-engine plane was reported stolen from the Bloomington, Indiana, airport. It was later found crashed in the shoreline waters of Great Abaco Island in the Bahamas, again leading to speculation that Moore was responsible. Shortly afterward, there were several break-ins reported across the island. On July 6, 2010, an indictment was released from a federal judge of the U.S. District Court of Western Washington, which was originally filed in December 2009. This indictment cites Moore for interstate transport of stolen property/airplane theft, related to a plane stolen from Bonners Ferry, Idaho that crashed outside of Granite Falls, Washington. The FBI placed a $10,000 bounty for information leading to his arrest, and federal agents believed that he was responsible for the recent Indiana theft. Capture On July 11, 2010, Moore was captured just before dawn at Harbour Island, Bahamas. Local officers picked up his trail in Eleuthera after recovering a 44-foot (13-meter) power boat stolen from a marina on Great Abaco. A police official said the suspect attempted to flee, but police shot out the engine on his stolen boat. Before being arrested, Moore threw his portable computer into the water and put a gun to his head, but the police talked him out of killing himself. He told the police that he intended to go to Cuba to throw authorities off his trail and from there to the Turks and Caicos Islands. His mother had hoped that he would flee to a country that did not have an extradition treaty with the United States. In March 2011, FBI Special Agent Fred Gutt confirmed the reward fund payout: \\"The $10,000 bounty money was paid out to people directly involved in (Moore's) capture.\\" The reward money was split among Jordan Sackett, Capt. Ronald Billiot, Capt. Patrick Young, Capt. Ben Johnson and Kenny Strachan, a security guard at the Romora Bay Resort. Criminal proceedings Moore pleaded guilty on July 13, 2010, to illegal entry to the Bahamas and illegally landing a plane. He was sentenced to three months in jail or a $300 fine. His mother wired the money to the U.S. Embassy in Nassau, which in turn paid the fine. He was deported the same day via overnight commercial flight, accompanied by Bahamian authorities and United States agents of the FBI to Miami, Florida. On July 14, Moore appeared before U.S. Magistrate Robert Dube to determine his legal representation, which had been hired on his behalf by his mother. In a hearing on July 16, 2010, in the U.S. District Court of Southern Florida, Judge Dube ruled that Moore would be sent to Washington state to face charges there first because he was arrested under their warrant. Moore waived his right to an extradition hearing. He was held at the Federal Detention Center in Miami until July 21, when he was transferred by the Justice Prisoner and Alien Transportation System to the Federal Detention Center in SeaTac, Washington. He was required to wear handcuffs and leg irons while being transported to Washington. A federal judge at the U.S. District Court of Western Washington in Seattle set a November 15 deadline for prosecutors to have Moore formally indicted by a federal grand jury. However, Moore waived his right to a speedy trial, permitting both the defense and the prosecution more time to prepare for the case. On November 18, 2010, Moore pleaded not guilty in federal court to charges of interstate transportation of a stolen plane, boat and gun, and of being a fugitive in possession of a firearm and of flying a plane without a pilot's license. On September 30, 2010, Harley Davidson Ironwing, a self-described associate of Moore's burglaries, pleaded guilty to assault and was sentenced to 18 months in prison. On June 17, 2011, federal prosecutors recommended that Moore be sentenced to six years in prison. Moore pleaded guilty to all seven counts on the federal indictment. The Washington State Court, however, recommended that he be sentenced to 10 years in prison for a break-in and burglary near Granite Falls, Washington. At sentencing, prosecutors were expected to ask for a term of 9¬Ω years, while Moore's attorneys, John Henry Browne and Emma Scanlan, were expected to ask for a 6 year term, citing psychiatric and mitigation reports describing his bleak childhood. On December 16, 2011, Moore was sentenced in Island County court to more than seven years in prison. Superior Court Judge Vickie Churchill stated, \\"This case is a tragedy in many ways, but it's a triumph of the human spirit in other ways.\\" Describing Moore's childhood as a \\"mind numbing absence of hope,\\" she stated the 20-year-old was genuinely remorseful for his crimes. Moore has said that he plans to spend his time in prison studying in preparation for applying to college in order to earn a degree in aeronautical engineering.Skagit Valley Herald December 16, 2011 On January 27, 2012, Judge Richard Jones of Federal District Court in Seattle sentenced Moore to six and a half years in prison for his infamous international crime spree. During sentencing Moore addressed the court and U.S. Judge Richard Jones, saying that it is \\"no stretch of the imagination to say that I'm lucky to be alive.\\" His federal sentence will be served jointly with state prison time. Notoriety Moore became known as the \\"Barefoot Bandit\\" or as the \\"Barefoot Burglar\\", for reportedly committing some of his crimes while barefoot. In Fall 2009, police found footprints at an airport hangar in Bonners Ferry, Idaho; a Cessna 182 stolen from there crash-landed approximately to the west near Granite Falls, Washington, after a few unsuccessful attempts to land at the small airport there. Police in the San Juan Islands also found cartoonish, chalk outlines of feet drawn upon the floor of a grocery store that was broken into in February 2010. Moore became an internet sensation with a Facebook fan page drawing about 60,000 members. A local Seattle man started selling T-shirts bearing Moore's picture with the words \\"Momma Tried\\". Local people from Camano Island also attempted to vent their frustrations through a song, as well as a blog which included the sale of merchandise and accepted donations to purchase the services of a bounty hunter. In April 2010, 20th Century Fox purchased the film rights to the book The Barefoot Bandit: The True Tale of Colton Harris-Moore, New American Outlaw, by Bob Friel. Moore's mother has retained celebrity lawyer Yale Lewis to seek control of entertainment interests related to her son. She has also hired John Henry Browne to handle her son's criminal defense. Under a plea deal Moore agreed to forfeit any profits from selling publishing rights to his story. The Barefoot Bandit Documentary (which premiered at Friday Harbor Film Festival on November 7, 2014, filmmaker Carly Bodmer) explores the childhood and time that Moore spent evading the law. Pam Kohler (Colton's mother), the FBI, lawyer John Henry Browne, and a range of personalities from Moore's hometown to the Bahamas piece together why he did what he did. A 2014 Canadian documentary about Moore called Fly Colt Fly: Legend of the Barefoot Bandit was made by brothers Adam and Andrew Gray, showing how the mythic story evolved in the media and how Moore became a 21st century outlaw folk hero. In December 2015, Moore began publishing a blog which has since been taken down. His stated intent was to break his long-standing silence, and to voice his support for presidential candidate Donald Trump. In July 2016, Moore was released on probation to a halfway house near Seattle. Moore has reportedly secured a job at his defense attorney's Seattle law firm, doing \\"low-level clerical work\\".Newly released ex-con ‚ÄòBarefoot Bandit‚Äô gets job with a surprising employer. q13fox.com (September 29, 2016), retrieved April 5, 2017.

The new element that appears, the public confession of sin and the redemption through offerings (lytra), unknown to traditional Greek religion, has made scholars to name this social phenomenon as oriental. The religious thought and the use of vernacular Koine Greek, full of innovative orthography, syntax and grammar, suggests that they may also represent something at the root of religion in Phrygia and Lydia.Angels and Principalities: The Background, Meaning and Development of the Pauline Phrase hai archai kai hai exousiai A. Wesley Carr Page 56 (2005) Marijana Ricl has argued that the practice of confession is a reminiscence of Hittite religion. According to Schnabel E.J it was a counter- move prompted by the increasing success of the Christian missionaries.Deutungen des Todes Jesu im neuen Testament edited by J√∂rg Frey, Jens Schr√∂ter Page 292 (2007) Indeed, beside the scheme of confession/redemption, phraseology and terms remind of Greek New Testament: hamartia (sin), parakletos (advocator), doulos tou theou (slave of god), kyrios (master), basileus (king). Another point for discussion is the punishment of sexual transgressions, which further relates the inscriptions to Christianity and the concept of chastity in Hellenistic philosophy and religion; in contrast to the previous perception of sexuality inside the religion (Hieros gamos, Sacred prostitution, Aphrodite Pandemos). Some indicating names or epithets of deities engaged in the inscriptions are: Men (Axiottenos, Artemidoros), Meter (mother), Zeus (Aithrios, Keraunios, Soter), Apollo, Hypsistos, Anaitis, Attis, Dionysos, Hades, Herakles, Sabazios, Batenos, Nemesis, Asclepius, Tyrannos, Basileus, Theos Strapton and Bronton, Hecate, Artemis etc. Inscriptions=Ritual dialogue of Theodoros with the Gods (Lydia, 235/236 AD)  { !

In 1844, Martina Castro was granted by Governor Jos√© Figueroa a further grant known as the Soquel Augmentation.Ogden Hoffman, 1862, Reports of Land Cases Determined in the United States District Court for the Northern District of California, Numa Hubert, San Francisco The Rancho Soquel grant along Monterey Bay includes present-day Soquel and Capitola.Dise√±o del Rancho Soquel Rancho Aptos of her brother Rafael Castro formed the south boundary of the grant. The much-larger Soquel Augmentation grant lay inland from both of these, and comprised mainly mountain watershed land. History Martina Castro (1807‚Äì1890), was born in Villa de Branciforte, daughter of Jos√© Joaqu√≠n Castro (1768‚Äì1838), grantee of Rancho San Andr√©s. Martina married Simon Cota, a soldier stationed at Monterey, in 1824. When Simon died six years later, in 1830, Martina became a widow with four children. Martina married Irishman Michael Lodge (1797‚Äì1849) in 1831, and she was granted the half square league Rancho Soquel in 1833. With Lodge's encouragement, Martina applied for a much larger grant of forested mountain land, inland from the earlier Soquel and Aptos grants. The huge area included the eastern side of the Soquel Creek watershed, most of the Aptos Creek watershed, Trout Gulch and much of Valencia Creek. The grant was approved in 1844 by governor Manuel Micheltorena. Lodge recognized the value of timber resources on the new lands, and contracted John Hames and John Daubenbiss to build a sawmill. Parts of the grant are now The Forest of Nisene Marks State Park, and the Soquel Demonstration State Forest. In 1848, Michael Lodge and Martina joined the California Gold Rush. Martina returned after three of her children died, but Lodge never returned and was presumed murdered. In 1849, Martina, at 42, married Louis Depeaux, a man 16 years younger than she was. Soon afterward, Depeaux left.Carolyn Swift, Stones to the Four Winds: The Sorrow of Martina Castro Lodge, Santa Cruz County History Journal, Issue Number Three, Special Bicentennial Edition, 1997 A daughter, Carmelita (Carmel) Castro Lodge (1827‚Äì1923) married Thomas Fallon in 1849. With the cession of California to the United States following the Mexican-American War, the 1848 Treaty of Guadalupe Hidalgo provided that the land grants would be honored. As required by the Land Act of 1851, a claim was filed for the Soquel grant with the Public Land Commission in 1852,United States.

The diss was a response to Eko Fresh's track \\"Die Abrechnung\\". The track was offered as a free download on the website MZEE.com and downloaded 100,000 times, becoming the best known diss track in Germany. Background Kool Savas and Eko Fresh began to dispute in 2002 and Eko Fresh left Optik Records shortly after. In 2004, Eko Fresh released the diss \\"Die Abrechnung\\", where he mainly attacks Kool Savas, but also criticises his former labelmates and other rappers. In the verse concerned with Kool Savas, Eko Fresh accuses his former colleague of being jealous of his fame. Style A notable feature of the song is that it has no chorus and instead has only one verse that lasts five minutes, which Kool Savas found exhausting to rap. Combined with his willingness to drop the feud, this meant he avoided performing the song on stage. Kool Savas performed the song on MTV TRL.http://www.myvideo.de/watch/570494/Kool_Savas_Das_Urteil_Live_Mtv_TRL Music video The video features an Eko Fresh lookalike. It starts with Eko Fresh walking in a forest where he discovers a grave which carries the dates of his career's beginning and end. He runs through the forest trying to escape but crosses Kool Savas' way, who drives a Chrysler 300 C. Kool Savas gets out of his car and forces Eko Fresh into the trunk. In the next shot Eko Fresh is crawling on all four with a chain around his neck. Savas leads him back to the grave field and makes a dismayed Eko Fresh dig his own grave. Once finished, Eko Fresh is forced into a coffin and buried alive.

Life=Origin and early life Palman was born in ca. 1290, in Styria (present Austria), into a noble, Roman Catholic family. He had the facial condition of Cleft lip and palate. Palman was brought up at the court of his father, and at 13 years he became a courtsman. At 16 he became a squire (armiger) at the service of Henry III of Gorizia until 1310, when his father died and he returned to Styria and inherited all of the family holdings. He then served the House of Habsburg; one of the Dukes crowned Palman a knight during the marriage of his daughter. At 27 years, he operated his harelip in Venice, as he thought it would help him in getting his love, a countess back home who did not feel the same, however it did not help. Broken hearted, he joined knight tournaments all over the Holy Roman Empire where he fought for several years, losing a finger. After returning, and still not having his love answered, he decided to leave for the Holy land. Palman and his entourage crossed into Zeta, a maritime province of the Serbian Kingdom, in hands of Young King (heir) Stephen Uro≈° IV Du≈°an, and decided to join his service as mercenaries. Service in the Serbian Empire Palman became the \\"captain of the Alemannic Guard\\", a mercenary unit under the direct hand of Du≈°an, consisting of him and his entourage (300 Germans). By January or February 1331, Du≈°an was quarreling with his father, King Stephen Uro≈° III, perhaps pressured by the nobility. According to contemporary pro-Du≈°an sources, evil advisors turned Uro≈° III against his son; he decided to seize and exclude Du≈°an of his inheritance. Uro≈° III sent an army into Zeta against his son, the army ravaged Skadar, but Du≈°an had crossed the Bojana. A brief period of anarchy in parts of Serbia took place, before the father and son concluded peace in April 1331. Three months later, Uro≈° III ordered Du≈°an to meet him. Du≈°an feared for his life and his advisors persuaded him to resist, so Du≈°an, including Palman's army, marched from Skadar to Nerodimlje, where they besieged his father. Uro≈° III fled, and Du≈°an captured the treasury and family. Du≈°an then pursued his father, catching up with him at Petriƒá. On 21 August 1331, Uro≈° III surrendered, and on the advice or insistence of Du≈°an's advisors, he was imprisoned. Du≈°an is crowned King of All Serbian and Maritime lands in the first week of September. Palman too, had his title elevated. Next he suppressed revolts in Zeta, by Bogoje, and in Serbian holdings of northern Albania, where he sent his nephew through his sister, ƒêorƒëe (Georg) with a band of the mercenaries. In ca. 1336, it was decided that Du≈°an would divorce Jelena, his wife, as she had not yet given birth to an heir. At the same time, talks began with Austrian Duke Otto V, that his niece, German King Frederick the Fair's daughter Elizabeth be married to Du≈°an. Austrian delegates arrived at Kotor, in maritime Serbia, in the spring. The mediator of the matter was Palman. Elizabeth, whom they did not ask for consent, was appalled by the thought that she was pushed into the unknown world, in a barbarous land in the East, to marry a King of a different faith, who already was married. She became acute anxious and died. When Queen Jelena heard of the potential divorce, she hurried to conceive, and promised a son, as to calm Du≈°an. Indeed, in the winter, Jelena became pregnant with a son.Corovic, \\"Istorija srpskog naroda\\", Third period, ch. \\"VII. Stvaranje srpskog carstva\\" When Du≈°an forged an alliance with the Byzantine fugitive John Cantacuzene and when it was agreed that both of them conquer Byzantine territory, Du≈°an took Veria, an important city in Thrace. As a security measure, Palman's army was sent to hold the town. However, Cantacuzene later that year deceived Du≈°an and recovered Veria, he allowed Palman's troops to leave the city safely while he kept the city's Serbs as hostages. In March 1355, a papal delegate led by bishop Peter Thomas arrived in Serbia in a mission to convert Serbs into Catholicism (the Serbs hoped to get help from Papal state to organize a Crusade against Ottoman Turks), and Du≈°an, who was angry with Louis I of Hungary, prohibited the Catholics in his army to join the sermon of the papal bishop. Upon hearing that German mercenaries joined a sermon, Du≈°an became enraged, but regained his composure soon thereafter, when their commander, Palman, said that they would defend their faith, not only by accepting punishment, but even by clashing against Du≈°an's Imperial Army, if need be. The papal bishop, irritated with the failure of his mission, turned home and on the way visited Louis I, asking him to furiously continue the war on Serbia.Corovic, \\"Istorija srpskog naroda\\", Third period, ch. \\"VIII. Delo cara Du≈°ana\\" In 1355 his unit was sent by Du≈°an to garrison the town of Klis (in the realm of Jelena, his sister) due to Croatian vassals to Hungary were advancing to Klis and Skradin. After the death of Du≈°an in 1355, he worked for Teodora. In 1363 he was a beneficiary of a will in Dubrovnik.

In theoretical physics, the notion of gauge symmetries depending on parameter functions is a cornerstone of contemporary field theory. A gauge symmetry of a Lagrangian L is defined as a differential operator on some vector bundle E taking its values in the linear space of (variational or exact) symmetries of L. Therefore, a gauge symmetry of L depends on sections of E and their partial derivatives.Giachetta (2008) For instance, this is the case of gauge symmetries in classical field theory.Giachetta (2009) Yang‚ÄìMills gauge theory and gauge gravitation theory exemplify classical field theories with gauge symmetries.Daniel (1980), Eguchi (1980), Marathe (1992), Giachetta (2009) Gauge symmetries possess the following two peculiarities. # Being Lagrangian symmetries, gauge symmetries of a Lagrangian satisfy first Noether's theorem, but the corresponding conserved current J^\\\\mu takes a particular superpotential form J^\\\\mu=W^\\\\mu + d_ u U^{ u\\\\mu} where the first term W^\\\\mu vanishes on solutions of the Euler‚ÄìLagrange equations and the second one is a boundary term, where U^{ u\\\\mu} is called a superpotential.Gotay (1992), Fatibene (1994) # In accordance with second Noether's theorem, there is one-to-one correspondence between the gauge symmetries of a Lagrangian and the Noether identities which the Euler‚ÄìLagrange operator satisfies. Consequently, gauge symmetries characterize the degeneracy of a Lagrangian system.Gomis (1995), Giachetta (2009) Note that, in quantum field theory, a generating functional fail to be invariant under gauge transformations, and gauge symmetries are replaced with the BRST symmetries, depending on ghosts and acting both on fields and ghosts.Gomis (1995) See also *Gauge theory (mathematics) *Lagrangian system *Noether identities *Gauge theory *Gauge symmetry *Yang‚ÄìMills theory *Gauge group (mathematics) *Gauge gravitation theory NotesReferences * Daniel, M., Viallet, C., The geometric setting of gauge symmetries of the Yang‚ÄìMills type, Rev.

A right-handed batsman and right-arm off break bowler, Hill played 371 first-class games for Hampshire. Hill was spotted by the cricketer and writer Sir Arthur Conan Doyle. Doyle was playing golf with Hill's father when he spotted the young Hill playing on an adjoining pitch. Doyle then wrote to Colonel J. G. Greig, Hampshire's secretary, to arrange a trial. In 1935, Hill was hit for 32 in an over by Glamorgan's Cyril Smart (6, 6, 4, 6, 6, 4), then the most expensive six-ball over in first-class history. In 1937, during a County Championship match played against Sussex at the United Services Recreation Ground, Hill and Donald Walker put on 235 for the 5th wicket, which remains to this day a Hampshire record. Kent captain Percy Chapman, a family friend of Hill's, presented him with his County Cap in 1935. Hill was accidentally shot in the leg by teammate Len Creese, while bowling in the nets. The bullet stayed in Hill's leg for the remainder of his life. Hill fought in the Second World War in Italy and resumed his first-class career with Hampshire after the resumption of the County Championship in 1946. Hill retired from first-class cricket in 1954.

It started being aired on November 5, 2008, replacing Vidas Robadas at 10:30PM. After a pair of schedule changes, it returned to 10:30PM until its end on July 15, 2009. The story is about a successful couple of TV hosts from a news channel, Mart√≠n Pells (Mike Amigorena) and Sol Casenave (Carla Peterson). In the first episode Mart√≠n Pells falls into a coma, and the CEO of the channel hires an underground actor, Gonzalo Echague (also by Amigorena), who happens to be extremely similar to Pells, to replace him. Such replacement is done not only for the TV but also with friends and relatives, in order that nobody suspects the absence of the real Pells. Gonzalo, acting as Martin, discovers that Martin and Sol had broken up long ago and were only acting as a happy couple for the television cameras. In reality, Sol had another lover which she hid from the public, and Martin had a homosexual relationship with the son of the CEO of the channel. Nevertheless, Gonzalo falls in love with Sol, and the main storyline of the soap opera involves his attempts to build a relationship with her. The production earned 6 Mart√≠n Fierro awards for the 2008 year.Vidas robadas, de Oro The format was brought by many other countries which produced their own versions. In Vietnam, the series has been aired on VBC under the name √îng b√† Pells (literally: Mr. & Mrs. Pells) from mid-2010. Design In the beginning, the provisional name for the series was \\"El exitoso se√±or Pells\\" (\\"The successful Mr. Pells\\"), with Mike Amigorena as Pells, who was by the time a low-profile actor. Fern√°n Mir√°s, √ârica Rivas and Diego Ramos, other actors called, were also of low profile. The only famous actress was Florencia de la V, who would have played the villain of the series. Rivas and Florencia de la V left the production. Rivas had other work offers, and the production was getting delayed a lot. Florencia de la V started to work at Showmatch, a TV show of a competing channel. The role of Florencia was taken by the actress Andrea Bonelli, while the one of Rivas was taken by Carla Peterson. Peterson was a high profile actress, who had shortly before played the main role in the successful series Lalola. With her incorporation, the name \\"El exitoso se√±or Pells\\" turned into \\"Los exitosos Pells\\" (changing from singular to plural). The name of the main character, Mart√≠n Pells, is the result of an internal joke of the production: one of the camera operators was called Mart√≠n Pels (with a single \\"L\\"), and allowed Ortega to use his name in the scripts. The basic idea of the script, a news program hosted by a couple of married hosts, is freely based over Telenoche, a news program of Argentina hosted by decades by C√©sar Masceti and M√≥nica Cahen D'Anvers, and other TV couples as well. Plot Martin Pells (Mike Amigorena), an arrogant and manipulative man, is the most famous news presenter of the country. He has worked several years in the \\"Mega News\\" Channel. Marcela Nunez (Mirta Busnelli), owner of the \\"M Noticias\\" (M News) channel, competitor of Mega News, attempts to hire him, and Pells is determined to accept. Martin tells this to the owner of Mega News, Franco Andrada (Hugo Arana), leading to a heated dispute. In a moment of anger, Franco pushes Martin, who falls backward hitting his head and was knocked unconscious. Scared and worried, believing that he killed him, he left the situation to his right hand, Amanda Wedell (Andrea Bonelli) and leaves the channel. Coincidentally, his car runs over Gonzalo Echag√ºe (Mike Amigorena), a poor actor and drama teacher very physically similar to Martin, who would replace Pells. Gonzalo, with his new life as Martin discovers that the Pells is a marriage only in front of cameras and the public. He learns that Martin Pells is gay, having a relation with Thomas Andrada (Diego Ramos), son of the owner of the channel, whereas Sol Pells has an affair with Diego Planes (Walter Quiroz), a Mega News journalist. Over time, Gonzalo falls in love with Sol, but is rejected by her, because of past abuses by Pells. With the help of Amanda, Gonzalo eventually discovers that his Pells similarity is not accidental, and that they are twins separated at birth. From that point takes more dedication to his role, as he considers its duty to protect the career of his brother while he is in a coma. In particular, he attempts to reverse the image of petty and selfish than others have of Pells in the channel. Gonzalo Echag√ºe, in his true self, comes to meet Sol and start a relation with her. At a point of their relation he explains he is required to replace the true Mart√≠n Pells, as the true one is in a coma. But Sol does not believe it, and re-think that Martin is mocking her. Further hints of the validity of the story surface later, but Sol still distrusts it due to the absence of solid evidence of Gonzalo's identity or whereabouts of the real Pells. Meanwhile, Marcela Nu√±ez obtained the majority of the shares of Mega News channel, becoming their new president. Franco Andrada tries then multiple ill-fated plots to retrieve the shares, including killing her. A new star of the channel, Alex (Andrea Frigerio), loses her pregnancy after being hit by Amanda, who tried to run over Nu√±ez. Sol, still wary of Martin, says her pregnancy is not his but of Diego planes. The use of an experimental drug awakes the real Martin Pells, who suffers from partial amnesia: although he remember who he is, what is his work and the people he knows, he can not remember his determination to leave Mega News prior to the accident. He does not return to his role in the newscast; instead, Franco continues to maintain the secrecy hiding him. Gonzalo realizes that the true Pells is awake and find his whereabouts, taking Sol to see him. Thus, he proves her his real identity. Franco intended to send Tomas and the real Martin to some distant country, while Gonzalo remain with Sun to the public by pretending to be Martin Pells indefinitely. However, Martin falls back into a coma when he saw Gonzalo, characterized as him, in the TV. Franco forbids Gonzalo to be with Sol or revealing the whole charade, and start several plots to secure his obedience. Gonzalo and Sol turn to Marcela Nu√±ez, and meet Sol's father. The four of them finally find the whereabouts of Martin Pells and attempt to rescue him, but Martin wakes from the coma and leaves, unaware of the conflict. Martin finally meets Gonzalo and learns the ongoing events, and they trick Franco to confess his crimes with a hidden camera at a bar, which was broadcast live. Tomas and the real Pells leave to another country, to get married without being followed by the media, while Gonzalo stays in his role in the TV, married to Sol.

It was written by Zekial Marko, based on his novel. The movie was known in France as Les tueurs de San Francisco. Nelson won the OCIC award at the 1965 San Sebasti√°n International Film Festival for the film.Once a Thief (1965) ‚Äì Awards Plot Ex-convict Eddie Pedak (Delon) tries to lead a normal life in San Francisco with a loyal wife Kristine (Ann-Margret), a daughter and a steady job. Much to his chagrin, he also has a police detective (Heflin) and brother (Palance) complicating his life. The detective, Mike Vido, remains bitter over being shot a while ago during an unsolved robbery, he is sure by Eddie. When a shopkeeper in killed in a robbery, he is convinced it is again Eddie, but the identification does not stick. Eddie nonetheless loses his job because of the arrest. His wife takes a job at a sleazy nightclub, where Eddie finds her, to his fury; in desperation, he finally accepts the offer of his persistent brother Walter to participate in a big heist. Walter gathers accomplices for the heist, but it becomes evident they had framed Eddie for the shopkeeper's murder, and mistrust grows. The thieves get away with $1 million in platinum bars, Eddie & Walter hiding the loot in a truck. The others find and kill Walter, and abduct Kristine's daughter in order to trade. Vido investigates and realises Eddie had been framed for the shopkeeper's murder. Eddie finds Vido, confesses that it was indeed he that had shot Vido years ago. and leads him, concealed, to where the remaining thieves and the loot are, as well as his daughter. There is a fight, that Eddie survives -- but Eddie's hysterical wife has separately alerted a different cop, who arrives running and shoots Eddie before Vido can alert him to what is going on.

Once a Thief was based on Marko's novel Scratch a Thief and this was his first screenplay. Marko had a small role in the film and spent time in jail on criminal charges during the shoot. Critical reception A. H. Weiler of The New York Times wrote that the film was not as good as similar genre pictures, but praised the accuracy of its gangster dialogue: The film was not a success at the box office.

Work with the Women‚Äôs Freedom League = Caravan tour  Tillard became involved with the Women's Freedom League (WFL) in 1908 and soon rose to the position of Assistant Organising Secretary.Women's Freedom League 1908, Report for the Year 1908, London, p. 2, held in the Suffragette Fellowship Collection, Museum of London. From May to mid-October of that year she helped establish branches of the League on a caravan tour of the southeast counties of England. The 'Votes For Women' caravan tour passed through Kent, East Anglia, Surrey and Sussex. It was on this tour that Tillard met Muriel Matters who was to remain a lifelong companion. Matters would later write of her friend's courage, sympathy, generosity and selflessness, stating that Tillard, \\"set one a standard to live by\\".Matters-Porter, Muriel 1930, unpublished manuscript memoir of Violet Tillard, held in the Suffragette Fellowship Collection, Museum of London.  Role in the Grille Protest  On 28 October 1908 the Women's Freedom League organised a large demonstration to take place at the Palace of Westminster.Nym Mayhall, L. E. 2000, 'Defining Militancy: Radical Protest, the Constitutional Idiom and Women‚Äôs Suffrage in Britain, 1908‚Äì1909‚Äô, The Journal of British Studies, vol. 39, no. 3, pp. 340‚Äì371. It was an organised protest that took place at similar times throughout the Palace of Westminster ‚Äì outside St Stephen's Entrance, the Old Prison Yard and in the House of Commons. The purpose of the protest was to draw attention to the struggle of women and remove the 'Grille', a piece of ironwork placed in the Ladies' Gallery that obscured their view of parliamentary proceedings. Violet's role was in the latter part of the demonstration ‚Äì to remove the offensive grille from the Ladies' Gallery. Tillard was joined in the House of Commons with her close friend Muriel Matters, Helen Fox and two male supporters in the Strangers' Gallery. Fox and Matters both chained themselves directly to the Grille and Matters began addressing the MPs directly, while the males in the Strangers' Gallery showered the house with handbills. Tillard's role was to force a WFL proclamation through the Grille and lower it on to the floor of the House using string. All four protagonists were set upon by attendants but were later released that night without charge. After they were permitted to leave Matters and Tillard immediately rejoined the protest outside St Stephen's portals but were subsequently arrested for attempting to break the police lines.'Woman Suffrage ‚Äì The Disorder at Westminster', The Times, 30 October 1908, p.9. The pair and eleven other members of the Women's Freedom League spent the following month in Holloway Gaol. Matters later recounted that, despite the ugly prison garb, \\"Till managed to look so graceful. How Cheerful she was, how philosophic when many were either 'edgy' [or] 'weepy with strain, or rebellion.\\"  Violet's sister and the Women's Freedom League  Violet's sister, Irene Tillard, was also involved with the Women's Freedom League. She is known to have helped on the caravan tour of 1908, and in August 1909 was arrested with eight other members of the WFL (including Charlotte Despard) for picketing outside 10 Downing Street, London. The picket prevented the Prime Minister, H. H. Asquith, entering his residence and the group were later sentenced to serve seven days imprisonment or pay fines of 40 shillings.Women's Freedom League 1909, Report for the Year 1909, London, p. 15, held in the Suffragette Fellowship Collection, Museum of London. As was the suffragist tradition they intended not to pay the fine and serve their imprisonment. However, as paying the fine did not require the consent of the incarcerated, the group's fines were anonymously paid against their will.  Work between 1910 and the outbreak of war  From May to early August 1910 Tillard accompanied Muriel Matters to Australia where her friend gave lectures focusing on her experiences in Britain agitating for change.'Suffragist Tactics ‚Äì Miss Matters in Sydney', The Sydney Morning Herald, 4 July 1910, p. 9. She is also known to have been in Dublin from 1912‚Äì1914, supporting the striking Dublin Transport Workers which was in the period in which the Dublin Lockout occurred.  Conscientious objection to the First World War  During the First World War Tillard was energised into helping conscientious objectors. She was appointed Co-Treasurer of the No-Conscription Fellowship's Maintenance Committee.Oldfield, Sybil 2001, 'Violet Tillard', in Women Humanitarians: A Biographical Dictionary of British Women Active between 1900 and 1950, Continuum, New York, p. 251. However, on 23 May 1918 Tillard found herself once again in court for her agitations. She was on trial for refusing to disclose to police the name of the person who printed the March edition of the No-Conscription Fellowship News. Tillard was found guilty under the Defence of the Realm Act and was sentenced to 61 days imprisonment to be served once again at Holloway.  Famine relief worker in post-war Germany and Russia  In 1919 Tillard travelled to war-torn Germany to help people recover from the effects of the war. She went with a Quaker mission organised by Joan Fry and in December of that year Tillard formally applied to become a member of the Religious Society of Friends. Whilst in defeated Germany she was confronted with immense misery and helped some students in Berlin survive the hardship. She provided relief in Germany as a nurse until October 1921 where she was transferred to famine-ravaged Buzuluk in Russia to help organise the relief work. There she found famine on a grand scale with an estimated five million dead at the conclusion of the food shortage. Confronted with mass impoverishment she wrote: :::One feels horrible to live in such good conditions when the people are literally starving at our doors ‚Äì a boy of sixteen lies dead a few yards away‚Ä¶ It isn‚Äôt so harrowing to see them lying dead. They suffer no more. It is the doomed shadows one sees around the streets and in the homes that are most horrible.Oldfield, Sybil 2001, ‚ÄòViolet Tillard‚Äô, in Women Humanitarians: A Biographical Dictionary of British Women Active between 1900 and 1950, Continuum, New York, p. 252. Tillard continued her tireless work with the Religious Society of Friends to help curb the suffering of the masses.  Death  Whilst in Russia Tillard's skills as a nurse were temporarily called upon in the Pavlovka District near her current post in Buzuluk. There, three fellow relief workers had fallen ill with typhus and it was her job to nurse them back to health. She was successful in accomplishing her objective but soon contracted the same disease. Tillard died of typhus on 19 February 1922.Oldfield, Sybil 2001, 'Violet Tillard', in Women Humanitarians: A Biographical Dictionary of British Women Active between 1900 and 1950, Continuum, New York, p. 253. Tillard's death was to feature briefly in the writings of Leon Trotsky who praised her work during the famine: :::In our bloodstained and at the same time heroic epoch, there are people who, regardless of their class position, are guided exclusively by the promptings of humanity and inner nobility. I read a brief obituary of this Anglo-Saxon woman, Violet Tillard; a delicate, frail creature, she worked here, at Buzuluk, under the most frightful conditions, fell at her post, and was buried there.... Probably she was no different from those others who also fell at their posts, serving their fellow human beings.... Here we count six such graves‚Ä¶ These graves are a kind of augury of those future, new relations between people which will be based upon solidarity and will not be shadowed by self-seeking. When the Russian people become a little richer they will erect (we are profoundly sure of this) a great monument to these fallen heroes, the forerunners of a better human morality, for which we, too, are fighting.Trotsky, Leon 1922, 'The Military Writings of Leon Trotsky, Volume 4: 1921‚Äì1923', References  Category:1874 births Category:1922 deaths Category:English suffragists Category:English nurses Category:English pacifists Category:English Quakers ","title":"Violet Tillard"},{"id":"24586335","text":"Christian Gottlieb Kratzenstein. Copper etching based on drawing by Paul Ipsen, 1781. Christian Gottlieb Kratzenstein (30 January 1723, Wernigerode ‚Äì 6 July 1795, Copenhagen) was a German-born doctor, physicist and engineer. From 1753 to the end of his life he was a professor at the University of Copenhagen where he served as rector four times. He is especially known for his investigations of the use of electricity in medicine and the first attempts at mechanical speech synthesis. As a teacher he wrote the first textbook on experimental physics in the united kingdom of Denmark-Norway. Biography Kratzenstein was baptized on 2 February 1723 in Wernigerode, Sachsen-Anhalt, Germany and grew up there in an academic family together with three brothers. His father gave them a good upbringing and education.E. Jacobs, Allgemeine Deutsche Biographie, Kratzenstein, Christian Gottlieb, Band 17, Duncker & Humblot, Leipzig (1883). During the years 1733-1742 he attended the Latin school in the same city. Already at this age he was recognized for his interests in reading and learning. He was especially fascinated by the latest discoveries within the natural sciences and mechanics.W.D. K√ºhnelt, Neue Deutsche Biographie, Kratzenstein, Christian Gottlieb, Band 12, Duncker & Humblot, Berlin (1980). In 1742 Kratzenstein started to study physics and medicine at the university in Halle which at that time had a leading position in that region. His interests turned now to the investigations of electricity and in particular the effects on living organisms.E. Snorrason, C.G. Kratzenstein, professor physices experimentalis Petropol. et Havn. and his studies on electricity during the eighteenth century, Odense University Press (1974). . After four years he received in 1746 doctoral degrees in physics and in medicine. He was then only 23 years old. After two years as a privatdozent he was in 1748 elected to the Academy of Sciences Leopoldina in the same city. At that time Kratzenstein had achieved international recognition and was in 1748 called to the science academy in Saint Petersburg. It is likely that Leonhard Euler, who had worked there earlier before he took up a new position at the Prussian Academy of Sciences in Berlin, had used his influence in this connection. He had corresponded with Kratzenstein over a period of several years. A Janvier map of Scandinavia from 1762. Kratzenstein had discovered that the coast of Norway was 150 km too far east on the maps then in use. In his new position Kratzenstein worked among other projects on improving instruments for navigation on the open seas. These were tried out in 1753 on a ship expedition from Arkhangelsk along the Norwegian coast through Kattegat and the Baltic Sea back to Saint Petersburg. During the voyage he had made a stop-over in Copenhagen and received a short time later an offer from the university there. In the fall of 1753 he was appointed professor of experimental physics and medicine. At the same time he was elected to the Royal Danish Academy of Sciences and Letters. He would remain in that city until his death.Susan Splinter, Zwischen N√ºtzlichkeit und Nachahmung : Eine Biografie des Gelehrten Christian Gottlieb Kratzenstein (1723-1795), P. Lang, (2006). , Kratzenstein became known in a short time as an engaging lecturer and attracted a large audience of both regular students and interested persons from the citizenry. He covered topics ranging from the newest insights about plants and animals, through geology, physiology to physics and chemistry. At that time there were often rather diffuse separations between these disciplines. When he died, he had saved 12000 riksdaler which were bestowed to the university. A few years later this fund enabled Hans Christian √òrsted to build up his own laboratory for physical experiments.D.C. Christensen, Hans Christian √òrsted: Reading Nature's Mind, Oxford University Press, Oxford (2013). . His work at the university strengthened the academic standards and manifested itself in many ways. Thus it was Kratzenstein who seized the initiative before the important transits of Venus in 1761 and 1769 instead of the astronomers at the Rundet√•rn observatory.P. Pippin Aspaas, Maximilianus Hell (1720-1792) and the Eighteenth-Century Transits of Venus, University of Troms√∏ (2012). In order to spread the impact of his lectures he wrote a textbook in experimental physics. It was published in several editions and appeared in German, French and Latin in addition to the Danish version.C.G. Kratzenstein, Vorlesungen √ºber die Experimentalphysik, Kopenhagen (1781). Digital version, Bayerische StaatsBibliothek. As a result of all his efforts and engagements he served as rector at the university during four periods. During his time in Copenhagen he maintained contacts with his former colleagues in Saint Petersburg. The science academy there announced in 1778 a prize competition concerning the mechanisms behind the vowels A, E, I, O and U in human speech. Euler had previously been interested in this problem and it is likely that he was behind the formulation of the task.C.G. Kratzenstein, Tentamen resolvendi problema, translated to German by C. Korpiun, Band 82, Studientexte zur Sprachkommunikation (ed R. Hoffmann), TUDpress, Dresden (2016). . Kratzenstein won the first prize in 1780 by constructing a ¬´vowel organ¬ª which could produce these special sounds. This represents one of the first contributions to modern speech synthesis. By his wide range of engagements and temperament Kratzenstein would often end up in conflicts with his colleagues. In later years he suffered in addition from illnesses which could have been caused by his chemical experiments. After his wife Anna Margrethe Hagen, with whom he had four children, died in 1783, he actively sought a new wife and married the year after Anna Maria Thuun from Hamburg.S. Splinter, Ein Physiker auf Brautschau, Feministische Studien, Heft 2, 277-286 (2005). Based on letters Kratzenstein wrote to Johann III Bernoulli. At the big fire in Copenhagen 1795 he lost most of his possessions and scientific equipment. He moved out to the suburb Frederiksberg where he died a month later. Important contributions Kratzenstein was a polymath and a typical representative of the Enlightenment. New ideas and discoveries were changing the understanding of the world. Observations and experiments should replace old dogmas and superstition. This conviction characterized the whole life of Kratzenstein whose curiosity led him in many directions. He excelled more by practical investigations and building of instruments than by developing new theoretical insights that would survive his own times. Body and soul As a student in Halle Kratzenstein made his first step to fame by his pamphlet Beweis, dass die Seele ihren K√∂rper baue in 1743. This was typical for the philosophical discourse at the university at that time. In this work he discussed the location of the soul in the body and how living organisms can continue to function after amputations and other severe changes to the body. If animals also had a soul, one had to explain what it does in a polyp which can grow up from a smaller part of an existing polyp. Such questions continued to occupy him in the following years in Halle where he also investigated parasites in the human body, for example tapeworms. At the same time in 1744 he also wrote the essay Th√©orie sur l'El√©vation des Vapeurs et des Exhalaisons dans l'Air in a prize competition announced by the science academy in Bordeaux. Here he is the physicist trying to arrive at a more microscopic explanation of what today is called gases and vapors. He estimated that a drop of water would transform into five hundred million smaller pieces by evaporation. Electricity and electrotherapy Kratzenstein, copper etching based by Jonas Haas, 1758. Already during his upbringing in Wernigerode had Kratzenstein become acquainted with electrostatic generators and seen the effects an electric current could have. This interest he widened during his studies in Halle with a special emphasis on the potential use of electricity in medicine. His thoughts in this direction he published in 1744 under the title Abhandlung von dem Nutzen der Electricit√§t in der Arzeneiwissenschaft. From experiments and observations he had seen how electricity could affect the human pulse and perspiration. In the same way he saw how electrical discharges could heal certain neurological disorders. These ideas were later taken up by others and developed into what today is generically called electrotherapy.W.E. Steavenson and H.L. Jones Medical electricity, H.K. Lewis, London (1892). Based on these ideas and investigations by Kratzenstein there have been speculations that he could have been a model for the fictitious doctor Frankenstein in the book of the same name written by Mary Shelley several decades later.P. W. Kaplan, The real Dr Frankenstein: Christian Gottlieb Kratzenstein?, J. Roy. Soc. Med. 95 (11), 577-578 (2002). Two years later Kratzenstein wrote the more theoretical work Theoria electricitatis mores geometrica explicata on the nature of electricity.C.G. Kratzenstein, Theoria electricitatis mores geometrica explicata, Halle (1746). Google Book. Around this time he made measurements to find out how the electric force between two charged objects varied with their separation. J.L. Heilbron, Electricity in the 17th and 18th Centuries: A Study of Early Modern Physics, University of California Press, Berkeley (1979). . On the theoretical side he argued that the electrical current was due to the motion of two fluids which today would correspond to the flow of positive and negative electric charges. The charges themselves should be due to vortices in these fluids. Around the same time Benjamin Franklin explained the same phenomena based on a one-fluid picture where negative charge was due to a lack of positive charge. It was this explanation that prevailed. Together with a similar thesis about bodily fluids and their properties, Kratzenstein received in 1746 a doctor's degree both in physics and in medicine. Navigation During the five years at the science academy in Saint Petersburg Kratzenstein was to a large extent occupied by improving methods and equipment for navigation on the high seas. The magnetic compass was made more reliable, astronomical observations should be made more precise together with the development of more accurate clocks to be used on ships for the determination of geographical longitude. These new instruments were tried out on the voyage from Arkhangelsk to Saint Petersburg in 1753 Kratzenstein discovered that the Norwegian coast was placed 150 km too far east on contemporary maps. This can seem unlikely due to the lack of accuracy of the watches being used. Many years later in 1793 Kratzenstein received a prize from the academy in Saint Petersburg for these observations and other magnetic measurements made on the same voyage. Transits of Venus Transit of Venus 1769 seen from Tahiti and Vard√∏. After the first observed transit of Venus in 1619, Edmund Halley had stressed the importance of the two upcoming transits in 1761 and 1769. Also in the Nordic countries there was great interest in taking part in these observations. In Copenhagen it was the astronomers in the local observatory Rundet√•rn who formally were responsible for such activities. But in practice it was Kratzenstein who became the leader of this endeavour. In public lectures before the transit in 1761 he presented the theoretical background for this rare phenomenon and calculated transit times together with suggestions for suitable places of observation. For the first transit he thus knew that it would be important to make the measurements further nord. He thus organized an expedition to Trondheim consisting of two students. One of them was Thomas Bugge who was then 20 years old and later would become an astronomer and important land surveyor in Denmark. The other student was Urban Bruun Aaskow who was even younger and studied medicine. Because of bad weather their observations in Trondheim were of little use. In Copenhagen the weather conditions were much better, but there the observations in Rundet√•rn failed due to inaccurate clocks. The next transit in the summer of 1769 would take place during the night in the continental Europe and could thus not so easily be observed. But north of the polar circle there would be midnight sun and thus ideal for observations. The united kingdom Denmark- Norway could therefore make important contributions to this transit. Thus by a royal decree from Christian VII an expedition to the northernmost military post in Vard√∏ was established. But in this process Kratzenstein was sidelined in favour of the Hungarian astronomer Maximilian Hell. The expedition was successful and the observations turned out to be of great value. A disappointed Kratzenstein had in the meantime organized a private expedition to Trondheim. On the way there it suffered a shipwreck where Kratzenstein saved himself by swimming ashore. He reached Tronheim barely in time but bad weather made meaningful observations impossible. Speech synthesis The physical understanding of sound waves was established around 1750 by Leonhard Euler and others. From 1766 Euler was again back at the science academy in Saint Petersburg. In a letter from 1773 he asked the question how speech could arise from the flow of air through the vocal folds and tract. An unanswered question was related to what tonal qualities characterised the different letters when spoken. Euler speculated that it should perhaps be possible to build some kind of musical instrument which could produce similar sounds and string them together to understandable words. One possibility was to build on the existing vox humana which could be found in some pipe organs. The result would then be a mechanical speech synthesizer. He pointed also out that the vowels would be of special importance.F. Brackhane, Kann was nat√ºrlicher, als Vox humana, klingen? Ein Beitrag zur Geschichte der mechanischen Sprachsynthese, PhD thesis, Universitetet i Saarland (2015). Kratzenstein had followed this discussion since he remained in contact with Euler and already from 1770 had been investigating the same problems. From his textbooks in experimental physics it is clear that he had a good understanding of the physics behind sound. It was therefore not so surprising that the academy in Saint Petersburg in 1778 announced a new prize problem exactly around these questions. The first part should investigate the tonal differences between the five vowels A, E, I, O and U, while the latter part asked for a device which could generate these sounds. free reeds used in a harmonium. At the final evaluation by the academy in 1780, it was Kratzenstein's \\"vowel organ\\" that got the first prize. His contribution Tentamen resolvendi problema was published the year after. It consisted of a first part describing how the vowels could be produced in the vocal tract. His medical background was here of great help. The second part was the construction of a new kind of organ with pipes for each of the vowels. Each pipe had a characteristic resonant cavity which should emulate the vocal tract for the corresponding vowel. In order to excite these resonators he made use of free reeds which at that time were little known. This instrument was demonstrated in Saint Petersburg to the full satisfaction of the academy, but was damaged and disappeared shortly afterwards. But the use of free reeds in musical instruments became later widespread and can today be found in the harmonica, accordion, harmonium and bandoneon. It is not known how Kratzenstein got the idea to use them, but they had for a long time been a central part of the Chinese musical instrument sheng.

It is a form of living history, performed in a virtual world using avatars. Features The neighborhood shows a wide range of buildings, some exact replicas of real buildings, such as the exclusive Hotel Adlon, Berlin Alexanderplatz station, the Zum Nu√übaum inn and the Brandenburg Gate. There are also fictional buildings in the architectural style of the time, such as the large Bauhaus- style apartment block in the city. There are many realistic signs and posters hanging on the city's walls, and visitors are expected to wear period clothing and behave in period appropriate ways. The neighborhood includes tiny apartments, shops, a cinema where people can view real 1920s movies, school, hotel and night club called Der Keller where people can listen to original 1920s music. Several participants \\"live\\" in local apartments, and have virtual jobs. Although there are many English-speaking visitors and residents present, several other languages are regularly spoken within the city. It is, however, common for residents and visitors to use German phrases to greet one another, regardless of preferred language. The simulation has rules for all visitors. People should dress in 1920s period style (free 1920s clothes are provided), the laws must be obeyed, and if you harass other visitors, you risk being banned. Nazi simulation is generally not allowed as it is against the Terms of Service of Second Life but also because in 1929, the Nazis were not yet that big a part of daily life in this city. A Dress code is strictly enforced in this world and failure to comply will risk ejection from Berlin. The idea is to see that all visitors and inhabitants feel as though they belong to the time period. In the entrance square, where visitors arrive by teleportation, there are free clothing boxes which allow avatars to change into virtual period costume. The project is known for its arts and entertainment. Der Keller Tanzlokal (Bar), The Babylon cinema, Cabaret Eldorado (based on a real 1920s club for gay people and cross dressers), The Odeon Theatre and The Hindenburg Schule all boast either educational activities, films, dancing, lectures or live entertainment. A very popular and active place is Der Keller, a bar located in a basement, in one of the city's back alleys. Most people gather at 2pm Second Life time to \\"drink\\" at the bar, chat and dance with others. In Der Keller, anyone can dance the Charleston and most are willing to join in on the fun. In The Babylon cinema, a cartoon, newsreel and feature film are shown. Cinema in Germany was ‚Äúan opportunity and temptation\\". The fact that an audience \\"member could sit in front of film screen and be enshrouded in darkness, made intimacy sociable and expanded the idea of unfamiliar identities.‚Äù [3] \\"German Expressionism was taking root in film and eventually influenced American Film Noir.\\"Berlin's Public Space in the 1910s and 1920s/Flickinger,Brigitte/Film Studies,Issue 10/2007/74,82 The 1920s Berlin Project has been expanding and is continuously keeps being updated. Starting small, it has managed to pay for its own upkeep almost since the very beginning, regardless the high costs of virtual land, especially thanks to the tenants who live in the sim, supporters and random donations from visitors. The more than 80 residences in the city are almost always occupied and recently new land was added to the sim where people could live; this new area is called Tiergarten. In March 2013, The 1920s Berlin Project was the subject of an episode of machinima documentary series The Drax Files: World Makers (Episode 2: Jo Yardley) In March 2016, well known machinima maker Pepa Cometa made a short video about the 1920s Project, it was seen by over 10.000 people in a few days and has been mentioned by the media, including being shown on German TV show 'Volle Kanne'. In May 2016 the project celebrated its 7th anniversary. Jo Yardley, creator and manager of the project, has plans for more historically-themed role playing sims. In September she started work on Time Portal, a non role playing sim with a time travel theme. Visitors arrive at a Time Machine and can visit several historical periods where they can explore, shop or live.

He descended from a long line of soldiers. He is known for his poetic translation into Urdu of Thomas Gray's masterpiece \\"Elegy Written in a Country Churchyard\\". Family background Ali Hyder's grandfather [Syed Mehdi Tabatabai] was a member of the Royal Guards under the Qajar dynasty of Iran. His father was [Syed Mustafa Tabatabai]. His cousin Buti Begum was the wife of king Wajid Ali Shah. Tabatabai is a large family which still resides in parts of the Iranian district of Kerman Shah (Bakhtaran) and also in eastern parts of Turkey. They are descendants of Hasan ibn Ali from his great-grandson Ibrahim AlTabataba. He used to lisp while talking, which is called \\"tabtabah\\" in Arabic. Life As Shahi Attaleeq (Royal Teacher) with Wajid Ali Shah's Grandsons As a young man, Ali Hyder was employed by the Nawab of Awadh, Wajid Ali Shah as a royal teacher. Wajid Ali Shah died shortly thereafter. The British offered Ali Hyder work, but he rejected the offer saying he could not be employed by \\"thugs\\" and \\"plunderers\\", since he believed that British had wrongly occupied India and had no right to rule it. He left Awadh and moved to Calcutta (Kolkata). He was well known for his command of Urdu. The European serving the British Crown were encouraged to have knowledge of the local language, this included monetary benefits, so many Europeans eager to learn Urdu came to him to learn the language. He taught several on the condition that they will teach him their language. This is how he learned several European languages, i.e. English, French and German. Gor e Gharibaan His famous gor-e-ghariban Graves of the poor) is a translation of Thomas Gray's Elegy Written in a Country Churchyard. The most remarkable thing is that it is a poem translated into a poem; those who master both in Urdu and English can understand the extent of accuracy in meanings and sense. If either of the poem is translated into another language in text the reader will find no resemblance what so ever, but translating an idiom of English into an idiom of Urdu conveying exactly the same sense though word to word meanings might be different. This can very easily be seen in the Titles of two poems, Thomas Grays elegy's title is \\"elegy written in Country Churchyard\\" and Gor e Gharibaan is Persian. Meaning Graves of the poor, sense is the same while word to word translation is different. the most remarkable thing about this poem is that it is written in golden words and kept into the world largest museum in England. Osmania University Mir Mahboob Ali Khan(Asaf Jah VI) had heard about Ali Hyder, a Shahi Ataleeq of Wajid Ali Shah, Asaf Jah though a very powerful ruler under the British Crown apparently didn't need to be impressed by anyone, specially Wajid Ali Shah dead and the state taken by the British. Asaf Jah invited Ali Hyder probably to give him some post in his court, as Asaf Jah himself did poetry and patronized scholars and poets. He offered Ali Hyder to critique his work, Ali Hyder had heard from the other people in court that the Nizam had been very rude to the gentleman who worked in that place, so he tactfully declined. Later Nizam offered him the job of Head of the Translation Department (Dar ul Tarjuma) of an Urdu Medium University, the Nizam had plans to build. Later the University was named Osmania University. Since all the subjects in this university were to be taught in Urdu, previously there were no Urdu Medium Universities in British India, syllabus of many other institutions was collected, this was in different languages mostly European, selection of appropriate books and literature and then organizing it in a way to form syllabus of different faculties of the University, that included Engineering, Medicine, subjects like Physics, Mathematics, Chemistry, Astronomy, and others. and then translating it into Urdu and publishing the books was all done by (Dar ul Tarjuma) under Ali Hyder.

If completed, the dam's designed main purpose is to provide protection from a failure of the unstable Mosul Dam upstream. In addition, the hydroelectric power station would have an installed capacity of 170 MW and the dam would further regulate tailwaters from Mosul Dam. History In response to concerns over Mosul Dam's karst foundation, Iraqi's Ministry of Irrigation began construction in 1988. Works on the dam ended in 1991 due to economic sanctions against Iraq. Other problems troubled construction as well, particularly lethal gas exhalation. Significant construction on the dam along with the hydro-power unit housing had occurred. The dam is roughly 40 percent complete. Current project Concerns over the stability of the Mosul Dam significantly contributed to recent efforts to restart construction of the Badush Dam, and possibly expand it as well. As early as December 2005, Iraq's Ministry of Water Resources was developing a project to restart construction on the dam. Currently, it would cost about US$300 million to complete the initial design but the Government of Iraq is wary of spending an additional US$10 billion to expand the dam's size in order to help mitigate a potential failure of the Mosul Dam.https://www.washingtonpost.com/wp- dyn/content/article/2007/10/29/AR2007102902193.html?hpid=topnews Washington Post Dam in Danger of Collapse The current project contains a main earth-fill dam with an inclined clay core and other random fills, two saddle dams (earth- fill dams) at the left bank and a concrete dam (hollow buttress type) at the right bank.

This provided the benefit of a shorter takeoff distance for a given load, a shorter distance to achieve a given height and a lower takeoff speed. This type of flap, in spite of its use on successful aircraft such as the Short Sunderland and the Short Stirling, was limited to use on aircraft produced by Short Brothers. __TOC__ Development The Gouge flap was patented in 1936, British Patent no. 443,516 being awarded jointly to Short Bros.

Excellent photographs of the fully extended flap, taken from obliquely above and below the wing, are given in the British Aeronautical Research Committee's research paper R&M; No. 1753.ARC R&M; 1753, 1936, p.8. Among the conclusions of that report were that \\"flap half and fully open decreases the distance from rest to take-off by 14 per cent. and 23 per cent., and also decreases the distance from take-off to clear a 50 ft. obstacle by 21 per cent. and 23 per cent. respectively. The speed at take-off is reduced by 3 and 8 m.p.h, respectively.\\" History Short Brothers first installed the Gouge flap on a Scion fitted with the (scaled-down) wings being prepared for the Short Empire flying-boat.Barnes & James, 1989, p.290 The flaps on this aircraft, which was designated 'M.3', were submitted to extensive testing by the Royal Aircraft Establishment Farnborough, their report appearing as R&M; No. 1753 (see Bibliography below). Shorts used the Gouge flaps on several successful aircraft types, e.g. the Empire boats,Barnes & James, 1989, p.314. the Short S.26 G-class 'Golden Boats', the Short SunderlandEden 2004, p. 442. and the Stirling.Barnes & James, 1989, p.371. When Flight Magazine described the Fowler flap in 1942,Flight Magazine, Vol. XLI, Issue 1737, p.353 the article's subtitle read \\"An American High-lift Device With Properties Similar to Those of the Better-known British Types\\", and the Gouge, Handley Page, and Fairey/Youngman flaps were all given equal mention. The Gouge flap, although widely used on Shorts aircraft, was not adopted by other manufacturers, several of which developed their own variants. The Aeronautical Research Council's R&M; no. 2622 entitled \\"The Aerodynamic Characteristics of Flaps\\" dated 1947 compared many variants but merely mentions the Gouge flap in a footnote on p. 10, where it is described as being \\"rather like the Blackburn flap ... but with no slot between the flap and wing.\\"ARC R&M; 2622, 1947, p.10. The advantage of the additional lift generated by a slot acted in the Fowler flap's success relative to the Gouge flap, as did its natural tendency to retract itself in flight. Shorts themselves did not use the Gouge flap on their next project, the Shetland, preferring the use of slotted flaps on this large seaplane.Barnes & James 1989, p.392.

Although the heavy round offered large firepower, the relatively low rate of fire and heavy recoil made hitting targets difficult. While pilots were trained to fire short bursts, on light aircraft only the first shot was truly aimed. Additionally, penetration of medium and heavy tanks' top armour was possible only at high angles (above 40 degrees), which was hard to achieve in battle conditions.

He was a specialist in the diseases of women and advocated certain surgical procedures, including clitoridectomies, as cures for epilepsy and hysteria. His career ended when he was accused of performing these procedures without consent of the patients. He was subsequently expelled from the Obstetrical Society of London. Biography=Early life Baker Brown was born in 1811 in Colne Engaine, Essex.Roy His parents were farmer Isaac Baker Brown, and Catherine (n√©e Boyer), the daughter of a schoolmaster. He went to school in Halstead, Essex, and became an apprentice to a surgeon called Gibson. He studied at Guy's Hospital, London and specialised in midwifery and diseases of women. He married Anne Rusher Barron on 18 June 1833, in Colchester, Essex. Following Anne's death he married his second wife, Catherine Read, on 21 May 1863. Career Baker Brown opened a medical practice in Connaught Square, London in 1834 and soon became known as a specialist in gynaecology. In 1845, he was one of the founders of St Mary's Hospital, London.Darby, p. 145 He was elected a Fellow of the Royal College of Surgeons in 1848.Sheehan, p. 326 In 1858 he founded the London Surgical Home for Women and worked on advancing surgical procedures. He began to perform ovariotomies on women, including his own sister. In 1864, he was the first person to describe a surgical treatment for stress incontinence involving a suprapubic cystostomy procedure.O'Dowd & Philipp, p. 493 He was elected president of the Medical Society of London in 1865. In 1866, Baker Brown described the use of clitoridectomy as a cure for several conditions, including epilepsy, catalepsy and mania, which he attributed to masturbation.Kent, p. 189Fennell, p. 66 In On the Curability of Certain Forms of Insanity, Epilepsy, Catalepsy, and Hysteria in Females, he gave a 70 per cent success rate using this treatment. During 1866, Baker Brown began to receive negative feedback from within the medical profession from doctors who opposed the use of clitoridectomies and questioned the validity of Baker Brown's claims of success. An article appeared in The Times in December, which was favourable towards Baker Brown's work but suggested that Baker Brown had treated women of unsound mind.Fennell, p. 66‚Äì69 The London Surgical Home was not licensed for this under the Lunacy Act and when the Lunacy Commission began to ask questions, Baker Brown denied it and tried to distance himself from the article.Fennell, p. 69 He was also accused of performing clitoridectomies without the consent or knowledge of his patients or their families.

In January 2005, Bajomo switched to the People's Democratic Party (PDP). Senate career  Ogun State, Nigeria In April 2007, he ran for the Senate on the PDP ticket and was elected for the Ogun West constituency. He was appointed to committees on Privatization, Foreign Affairs, Finance, Establishment & Public Service, Banking, Insurance & Other Financial Institutions and Appropriation. In March 2009, he was involved in a scrap between Ogun State Governor Gbenga Daniel and Ogun senators Iyabo Obasanjo- Bello and Lekan Mustapha. The dispute dragged on into July, with Yoruba Elders backing Governor Daniel while four representatives and the two senators remained in opposition and failing to attend a meeting when president Yar'Adua visited the state. In May 2009, Bajomo was among ten senators who made a controversial all-expenses-paid trip to Ghana, where they were rumoured to have been influenced by oil companies at a seminar on the Petroleum Industry Bill. The Senate ordered a full investigation into the matter by its Ethics, Code of Conduct and Public Petitions Committee. However, there were delays in issuing the committee report. In September 2009, he called for the Ministry of Finance, the Central Bank of Nigeria (CBN) and other economic experts to inject money into the economy. Speaking about initial public offerings (IPOs) before the recent financial crisis, where many people paid inflated prices, he said that the Securities and Exchange Commission should have dealt with those responsible, but not the Economic and Financial Crimes Commission unless there was clear evidence of fraud. Earlier he had stated that the N420 billion used by the CBN to bail out five banks did not require appropriation by the National Assembly.

The band formed in 2007, and gained international recognition after the release of their debut album I (One) via Candlelight Records in 2009, a record label they stuck with throughout their existence. Containing elements of progressive, death, thrash and symphonic metal, Xerath's music is characterized by the mix of polyrhythmic guitar riffing and drumming, with orchestral and symphonic elements. Xerath cited their influences as Strapping Young Lad, Dimmu Borgir, and Opeth as well as film score composition and an eclectic mix of other bands and genres. After nearly a decade of touring and three album releases (named sequentially I, II and III), the group disbanded in early 2017. History Xerath play at SpringSpree in 2011 during a tour of India Formation of band Xerath was the brainchild of its first guitarist, Andy Phillips, who formed the band in 2007 with drummer Michael Pitman, bassist Owain Williams and Richard Thomson as an experiment to combine film score style composition and classical music with technical heavy metal. The idea was to try and take advantage of a direction that metal music had failed to exploit, with the rare exceptions of bands like Dimmu Borgir. In that first year, Xerath won the Terrorizer Magazine best unsigned band competition based on reader votes, which led to, in early 2008, signing their first record deal with Candlelight Records, a record label they remained with for their entire history. Success Xerath released their debut CD entitled I (One) in May 2009, this was followed by their first notable live performance at Bloodstock Open Air festival. They went on to become regulars at the festival, playing there in 2011, 2013 and 2015. By the time their second album, II (Two), was released on 3 May 2011, Owain Williams was the lead-guitarist and the band was a well established success, they were touring China and India, and were often seen at Europe's music festivals such as Euroblast. Their third and final album III (Three), with new lead-guitarist Conor McGouran, was released in September 2014. Demise Xerath's lead guitarist position changed twice in their history. Andy Phillips, the band's principle founder and first lead-guitarist was replaced by former bassist Owain Williams, who was in turn replaced by guitarist Conor McGouran in 2013. The average of one lead guitarist per album released did not dampen the success of the band, but in 2016 both the bassist and drummer changed and splits in the direction that Xerath needed to go started to appear. Richard Thomson was the band's only remaining founding member when they announced their disbandment on 1 February 2017 via an announcement on their Facebook page. Their final recording, Regret, was released online along with the announcement. Their planned fourth album was never completed, officially announced nor named, but it was often mentioned and referred to as IV or IIII (four) based on their previous album names. Two members went on to team up with J√∏rn Lande, ZP Theart and others in the band Pentakill, whose second album (prefixed with a Xerath-like II) topped the iTunes metal chart shortly thereafter.

In the trial court the defendant requested that instructions be given to the jury about contributory negligence and a standard resembling the reasonable person standard, but the judge declined to give the instructions.

The deportees were forcibly sent to the small, isolated island in Western Siberia, located northwest of Tomsk, Russian SFSR, to construct a \\"special settlement\\". They were abandoned with only flour for food, and little in the way of tools, clothing, or shelter, and those who attempted to leave were killed by armed guards. The conditions of the island led to widespread disease, abuse of power, violence, and cannibalism. Within thirteen weeks, over 4,000 of the deportees related to Nazino Island had died or disappeared, and a majority of the survivors were in ill health. The Nazino affair was virtually unknown until 1988, when an investigation by Memorial began during the glasnost reforms in the Soviet Union. The events were popularized in 2002 when reports of a September 1933 special commission by the Communist Party of Western Siberia were published by Memorial. Background In February 1933, Genrikh Yagoda, head of the OGPU secret police, and Matvei Berman, head of the GULAG labor camp system, proposed a self-described \\"grandiose plan\\" to Joseph Stalin, the General Secretary of the Soviet Union, to resettle up to two million people to Siberia and Kazakhstan in \\"special settlements.\\" The deportees, or \\"settlers,\\" were to bring over a million hectares (10,000 km2; 2.5 million acres; 4,000 sqmi) of virgin land in the sparsely populated regions into production and become self-sufficient within two years. Ch. 13 Yagoda and Berman's plan was based on the experience of deporting two million kulaks (wealthier land-owning peasants) and other agricultural workers to the same areas that had occurred in the previous three years as part of the Dekulakization policy. However, unlike the previous plan, resources available to support the new plan were severely limited by the ongoing famine in the Soviet Union. Despite this, the new plan was approved by the Soviet Council of People's Commissars of the USSR on 11 March 1933. Shortly after the plan's approval, the number of prospective deportees was reduced to one million deportees. Deportees The original plan targeted several types of kulaks, peasants, \\"urban elements,\\" people living in the agricultural areas of Soviet Union's western territories such as the Ukrainian SSR, and the Lower Volga, North Caucasus and Black Earth Region in the Russian SFSR. Instead, many of the deportees were people from Moscow and Leningrad who had been unable to obtain an internal passport. The passportization campaign in the Soviet Union began with a decision by the Politburo on December 27, 1932, to issue internal passports to all residents of major cities, and one of their objectives was to \\"cleanse Moscow, Leningrad and the other great urban centers of the USSR of superfluous elements not connected with production or administrative work, as well as kulaks, criminals, and other antisocial and socially dangerous elements.\\"Protocol of the Politburo meeting of November 15, 1932, Istochnik no. 6 (1997), p. 104; quoted in p.15 Deportees were primarily, \\"D√©class√© and socially harmful elements\\", meaning former merchants and traders, peasants who had fled the ongoing famine in the countryside, petty criminals, or anybody who did not fit into the idealized communist class structure. Their backgrounds meant they were not issued passports, and they could be arrested and deported from the cities after a summary administrative procedure. Most of the arrestees were deported within two days. pp. 15-22 Between March and July 1933, 85,937 people living in Moscow were arrested and deported because they lacked passports, while 4,776 people living in Leningrad were also deported. Those arrested in connection with the cleansing of Moscow prior to the May 1, 1933, May Day holiday were assigned to a transit camp in the city of Tomsk. Transportation According to the plan of Yagoda and Berman, the deportees would pass through transit camps at Tomsk, Omsk, and Achinsk. The largest camp was at Tomsk, which had to be rebuilt from scratch, starting in April to hold 15,000 deportees. 25,000 deportees arrived in April even though the camp was not scheduled to be completed until May 1. River transport to the final labor camps was closed until the start of May until ice on the Ob and Tom Rivers cleared. Most of the first arrivals were kulaks, other agricultural workers, and people from southern Russian cities. The arrival of so many deportees panicked Tomsk authorities, who viewed them as \\"starving and contagious.\\" pp. 86-92 A report by Vassily Arsenievich Velichko, the local Communist Party head in Narymsky District of the West Siberian Krai, gave twenty-two examples of people who had been deported: Murom railway station A rail convoy holding d√©class√© deportees left Moscow on April 30, and a similar convoy left Leningrad on April 29, with both arriving on May 10. The daily food ration during the trip was 300 grams (10 oz) of bread per person. Criminal groups among the deportees beat the other deportees and stole their food and clothing. The authorities in Tomsk were unfamiliar with urban deportees and expected trouble from them, so decided to send them to the most isolated work sites. Two nights after their arrival in Tomsk, a disturbance broke out as they demanded drinking water, but the riot was put down by mounted troops. pp. 102-120 Many of the urban deportees were later sent to Nazino Island (), a river island on the Ob River located north of Tomsk, in a particularly empty part of Western Siberia inhabited by only a small number of indigenous Ostyak people. pp. 15-22 Four river barges, which were designed to haul timber, were filled with about 5,000 deportees on May 14, 1933. About a third of the deportees were criminals who were sent in order to \\"decongest the prisons.\\" About half were d√©class√© people from Moscow and Leningrad. The authorities who were to be in charge of the labor camps were first informed that they would be sent on May 5. These authorities had never worked with urban deportees and had no resources or supplies to support them. pp. 121-125 The deportees were kept below decks on the barges and apparently fed a daily ration of 200 grams (7 oz) of bread per person. Twenty tons of flour - about 4 kg (9 lb) per person - were also transported, but the barges contained no other food, cooking utensils, or tools. All supervisory personnel, two commanders and fifty guards, were newly recruited and had no shoes or uniforms. pp. 121-129 Nazino Island The barges unloaded their passengers during the afternoon of May 18, on Nazino Island, a swampy island about 3 km (2 miles) long and 600 meters (650 yd) wide. There was no roster of the disembarking deportees, but on arrival 322 women and 4,556 men were counted, plus 27 bodies of those who died during the trip from Tomsk. Over a third of the deportees were too weak to stand on arrival. About 1,200 additional deportees arrived on May 27. pp. 127-130, 146 A fight broke out and guards fired on the deportees as the twenty tons of flour were deposited on the island and distribution began. The flour was moved to the shore opposite the island and distribution was tried again the next morning, with another fight and more firing resulting. Afterward, all flour was distributed via \\"brigadiers\\" who collected flour for their brigade of about 150 people. The brigadiers were often criminals who abused their positions. There were no ovens to bake bread, so the deportees ate the flour mixed with river water, which led to dysentery. pp. 130-137 Some deportees made primitive rafts to try to escape, but most of the rafts collapsed and hundreds of corpses washed up on the shore below the island. Guards hunted and killed other escapees as if they were hunting animals for sport. Because of the lack of any transportation to the rest of the country except upstream to Tomsk, and the harshness of life in the taiga, any other escapees who made it across the river and evaded the guards were ultimately presumed dead. pp. 130-137 Shortly after the deportees had already arrived on Nazino Island, the Yagoda and Berman plan was rejected by Stalin. pp. 1-12 Order on the island quickly broke down and devolved into chaos: the majority of the population were city dwellers, most of whom knew nothing about basic agricultural practices such as clearing and cultivation that would make the island properly habitable. The sparsity of resources led to gangs forming, who began using violence to dominate the settlers. People were frequently murdered in fights over food and money, and the bodies of those in possession of anything of value such as gold tooth fillings and crowns were often looted. The guards established their own reign of terror, extorting settlers and executing people for minor offences despite being apathetic towards the gangs. The guards were also assigned to keep the settlers in and killed people who attempted to escape. Even the doctors sent to monitor the island's population, who were supposed to have protection, began to fear for their lives. The lack of proper food and the frequency of death by late May led to cannibalism becoming widespread, to the point that settlers eventually began murdering individuals for the sole purpose of consuming them. On May 21, the three health officers counted seventy new deaths, with signs of cannibalism observed in five cases. Over the next month, guards arrested about fifty people for cannibalism. Aftermath The dire situation on Nazino Island was finally ended by Soviet authorities in early June, when the settlement was dissolved and the surviving 2,856 deportees were transferred to smaller settlements upstream on the Nazina River, leaving 157 deportees who could not be moved from the island for health reasons. Despite the settlement being disestablished, several hundred more of the deportees died during the transfer. People who survived the transfer found themselves with few tools, little food, and facing an outbreak of typhus. Most deportees refused to work in the new settlements due to their previous treatment. pp. 138-153 In a period of thirteen weeks, of the roughly 6,000 deportee settlers intended for Nazino Island, between 1,500 to 2,000 had died due to starvation, exposure, disease, murder, or accidental death. Another 2,000 settlers had disappeared and their whereabouts were untraceable, so they were presumed dead. The death tolls include people who either died or disappeared during their transportation to or from the island. In early July, new settlements were constructed by the authorities using non- deportee labor, but only 250 Nazino Island settlers were transferred to these. Instead 4,200 new deportees who arrived from Tomsk were housed in these settlements. A report on the events which was sent to Stalin by Velichko was distributed by Lazar Kaganovich to members of the Politburo, and was preserved in an archive in Novosibirsk. It stated that 6,114 \\"outdated elements\\" arrived on the island in May 1933, and at least 27 people died during the river transport. There was no shelter on the island; it snowed the first night, and no food was distributed for four days. On the first day 295 people were buried. Velichko‚Äôs report claimed only 2,200 people survived out of about 6,700 deportees that he calculated had arrived from Tomsk. The report resulted in a commission by the Communist Party to study the affair. In October, the commission estimated that of the roughly 2,000 survivors from Nazino Island, half were ill and bedridden, and that only about 200 to 300 were physically capable of working. pp. 154-170 There were attempts by local officials and guards at the island to dispute Velichko's report but were instead reprimanded, receiving prison sentences ranging between twelve months to three years. The events that occurred at Nazino Island highlighted issues with Soviet colonization projects, and the Soviet leadership began to doubt their quality and efficiency. In 1933 alone, there were 367,457 known untraceable \\"special resettlers\\", of which 151,601 were dismissed and 215,856 simply disappeared from their settlements. Nazino Island directly led to the end of large scale settlement plans in the Soviet Union, and to the end of using deportees from \\"urban d√©class√© elements\\" and criminal backgrounds for future settlement plans. Rediscovery After the initial investigations in late 1933, the events at Nazino Island were largely forgotten as they were not made public, and only a small number of survivors, government officials, and eyewitnesses knew of their occurrence. In 1988, at the time of the glasnost policy in the Soviet Union, details of the Nazino affair first became available to the general public through the efforts of the human rights group Memorial. In 1989, an eyewitness reported to Memorial:translated in The French historian Nicolas Werth, who earlier co-authored The Black Book of Communism, published the book Cannibal Island about the affair in 2006. It was translated into English in 2007. In 2009 a documentary L'√Æle aux Cannibales (Cannibal Island) was made, based on the book. Nazino Island, now located in Alexandrovsky District of Tomsk Oblast, Russia, is also called \\"Death Island\\" (, ') or \\"Cannibal Island\\" due to the events there.

Biography Wills was baptised at St. Goran, Cornwall, on 23October 1666, the son of Anthony Wills of St Goran, and his wife 'Jenofer' (Guinevere). His father, whose family had been settled in Cornwall since early in the sixteenth century, farmed his own land, and, having encumbered his estate with debts, quit the same at the English Civil War and offered his services and those of six of his sons to the Prince of Orange, who, it is said, gave them all commissions. Charles Wills appears to have been appointed a subaltern in Colonel Thomas Erle's foot regiment (disbanded in 1698), with which corps he served in the Irish campaign. On 1July 1691 he was appointed captain in the 19th Regiment of Foot, the colonelcy of which had been bestowed on Erle on 1 January 1691. Wills served several campaigns in Flanders, including the 1693 Battle of Landen. On 6November 1694 he was appointed major to Colonel Thomas Saunderson's foot regiment, and on 1 May 1697 was promoted lieutenant-colonel. A few months later Saunderson's foot was disbanded and the officers placed on half-pay. On the formation of Viscount Charlemont's 36th Regiment of Foot in Ireland (28 June 1701), Wills was appointed to the lieutenant-colonelcy, and in the following spring embarked with his corps for Cadiz in Spain. From Spain Charlemont's regiment was sent to the West Indies, where Wills gained distinction on the island of Guadeloupe, and several towns were burnt after the French troops had been defeated. In the action at La Bayliffe 'Colonel Wills behaved himself with great bravery' (London Gazette, 10May 1703). He succeeded to the command of the troops on shore in April 1703; and, after burning and destroying the French towns and fortifications along the coast, he embarked his troops on board the squadron on 7May 1703, bringing away all the captured French guns. After losing many officers and men in the West Indies, the 36th foot returned to Ireland in the winter of 1703‚Äì4. In 1705 Wills accompanied the Earl of Peterborough to Spain as quartermaster-general, and served almost uninterruptedly in the Peninsula until December 1710. He was at the Siege of Barcelona on 4 October 1705, and nine days later was appointed colonel of a regiment of marines (30th foot), vice Thomas Pownall. Wills was subsequently second in command in the district of Lerida, and rendered valuable service in the important action at San Estevan, where he commanded after Major-general Conyngham was mortally wounded (26 Jan. 1706); again distinguished himself at the defence of the town of Lerida, which capitulated after an obstinate defence; was appointed a brigadier-general on 1 January 1707; commanded 1,500 marines and a Spanish regiment in Sardinia (1708), and reduced Cagliari. He was promoted major-general on 1 Jan. 1709, and appointed commander-in-chief of the forces on board Admiral Baker's fleet on 17 June in the same year. Wills fought at Almenara in 1710, and commanded an infantry brigade at the battle of Saragossa. He was thereupon recommended to Queen Anne for promotion to the grade of lieutenant-general (Marlborough Despatches, v. 168), which rank had been already conferred on him in Spain by Charles III, the titular king. In the unfortunate action at Brihuega on 1 Dec. 1710, Wills earned fresh laurels, and was mentioned in General Stanhope's despatches as having been ‚Äòduring the action at the post which was attacked with most vigour and which he as resolutely defended.‚Äô After suffering a rigorous imprisonment of some months, Wills was allowed to return to England. When Preston was taken by Jacobite forces at the 1715 Battle of Preston, Wills, who was then commanding in Cheshire, assembled his troops at Manchester, and then marched to Wigan, where he arrived on 11November He had at his disposal the cavalry regiments of Pitt, Wynne, Honeywood, Dormer, Munden, and Stanhope, and Preston's foot regiment. At Wigan, Wills received intelligence that Lieutenant-general George Carpenter was advancing from Durham by forced marches with about nine hundred cavalry, and would be ready to take the enemy in flank. Early on 12 November Wills marched towards Preston, and at one in the afternoon he arrived at the bridge over the Ribble, and found there about three hundred of the rebel horse and foot who upon the approach of the royal troops withdrew hastily into the town, where barricades had been erected. On coming before Preston a reconnaissance was made by Wills in person, and, in consequence of his party being fired upon and two men killed, he ordered an immediate assault by Preston's foot regiment, which corps behaved with great bravery. At the same time Wills ordered the whole town to be surrounded, to the right and left, by the cavalry. The rebels, being well posted behind the barricades, inflicted great loss on Preston's regiment (the Cameronians), which was commanded by Lieutenant-colonel Lord Forester. After two barricades had been gallantly charged, and the troops repulsed with equal courage, Wills drew off his men, and, all the avenues to the town having been effectually secured, the cavalry were ordered to stand at their horses' heads all that night. At nine o'clock next morning General Carpenter arrived with three dragoon regiments. The rebels witnessed the arrival of the reinforcements from the church steeple, and, losing heart, their commander was anxious to capitulate. 'Unconditional surrender' were the only terms that Carpenter and Wills would give, and after stormy debates within the beleaguered town the rebels laid down their arms and surrendered next morning [see Forster, Thomas, 1675?‚Äì1738; and Oxburgh, Henry]. A good deal of friction occurred between Carpenter and Wills on this occasion, the former being the senior officer, and it was increased by George I bestowing the rank of lieutenant-general on Wills directly news of the surrender of the rebels at Preston reached London, no notice being then taken of Carpenter's share in the success. In January 1716 Carpenter sent a challenge by General Churchill to Wills, but the duel was honourably compromised by the generous intervention of the Dukes of Marlborough and Montagu. Wills was appointed colonel of the 3rd foot on 5 January 1716, governor of Portsmouth 1717, lieutenant-general of the ordnance on 22 April 1718. Wills was returned as Member of Parliament for Totnes by the Duke of Bolton at a by-election on 29 December 1718 and was appointed to the Privy Council on 9 May 1719. He was returned unopposed again at the 1722 general election. He was said to have been a follower of Lord Cadogan, and voted consistently with the Administration. He was knighted as KB on 17 June 1725 and became Colonel of the grenadier guards on 26 August 1726. At the 1727 general election he was returned unopposed again and in a loyal address, the Totnes corporation declared 'our borough now sends to your senate, a Wills; who as he has been the scourge of perfidious rebels at home, will, we doubt not, on occasion, with like courage and success, vanquish and confound all your Majesty‚Äôs faith-breaking enemies abroad'. In 1730 he became a general. He was returned convincingly in a contest for Totnes at the 1734 general election. At a review of the footguards‚Äô in July 1737, Wills rode off the field when the King called him a liar. He became general commanding the foot in 1739 but did not become a peer or field marshall as was expected. He was returned again as MP for Tornes in a contest at the 1741 general election. Wills died unmarried in London on 25 December 1741, and was interred in Westminster Abbey. There is a memorial inscription to him in the Guards Chapel, Westminster. It appears from the Political State of Great Britain for September 1726 that there was an intention, unrealised owing to George I's death, of creating Wills a peer with the title of Baron Preston. With the exception of a few legacies and an annuity of ¬£200 per annum to his nephew Richard Wills, Sir Charles bequeathed all his fortune, which was a very considerable one, to his executor, General Sir Robert Rich, bart. This will was unsuccessfully contested by Sir Richard Wills in the probate court.

One third of the council was up for election and the council stayed under no overall control. Overall turnout was 34.6%. After the election, the composition of the council was *Liberal Democrat 18 *Labour 17 *Conservative 14 *Independent 2 Campaign Since the 2006 election the Labour party had been running the council in an agreement with the Conservatives and both parties did not rule out continuing this arrangement after the election. However, a major issue in the election was a proposal by the Labour party to close 10 play areas across Derby in order to save money, which were opposed by the Conservatives. The arrangement was also strained by the defection of 2 Labour councillors, Hardial Dhamrait and Amar Nath, to the Conservatives since the 2007 election. Other changes since 2007 included Labour councillor Prem Chera becoming an independent, and independent Frank Leeming joining the Conservatives. This meant that before the election there were 21 Labour, 14 Conservative, 13 Liberal Democrat and 2 independent councillors. In all 61 candidates stood in the election, with 17 seats being contested. Of those 17 seats Labour were defending 8, the Conservatives 6 and the Liberal Democrats 3. The leader of the Conservative party, David Cameron, visited Derby to support the local party on 3 April and described it as a \\"key battleground\\". Election result The Liberal Democrats gained 5 seats to move from third largest group on the council to become the largest party, overtaking the Labour and Conservative parties. Liberal Democrat gains were recorded in Abbey, Arboretum and Mackworth wards from Labour, and in Blagreaves and Oakwood wards from the Conservatives. Meanwhile, Labour recovered a seat in Sinfin which they had lost when Hardial Dhamrait had defected to the Conservatives. However, Labour also two seats in Chaddesden and Chellaston to the Conservatives. Following the elections the three parties held discussions to decide who would run the council for the next two years. On 6 May the Conservatives decided that they would not agree any deal with the other two parties and would sit in opposition, with Conservative councillors feeling that the previous agreement with Labour had meant they did not make gains as the party had done nationally. The Liberal Democrats and Labour then planned to hold talks, with Labour abandoning their previous proposals to introduce congestion charging in Derby, and parking meters in Littleover. However, the Liberal Democrats decided they would prefer to run the council as a minority rather than reach an agreement with Labour. At the council meeting on 21 May the Liberal Democrat leader, Hilary Jones, was elected leader of the council by 19 votes to 17 after the Conservatives abstained.

The main purposes of the dam would be to produce 1,500 MW of hydro-electricity and to manage flooding. If completed, the high Bekhme Dam will be the largest in Iraq. Construction on the dam began in 1979 and was halted during the Iran‚ÄìIraq War. Construction started again in 1988 and halted in 1990, prior to the Gulf War. In post-2003 Iraq, the Kurdistan Regional Government began efforts to rebuild the Bekhme Dam.https://dawsonolivertheworld.com/2016/03/15/iraqs-hoover-dam-that-never- was/ Initial construction The Bekhme Dam was planned in the 1950s with a preliminary study done by Harza Engineering Co., and in 1979 and through the early 1980s the project was redesigned by EPDC of Japan. Construction was assigned to a consortium of Turkish-Yugoslavian firms (ENKA Hidrogradnja and Energoprojekt). Construction on the project started in 1987 with access roads, residential camps, construction facilities and the development of quarries and borrow areas. Tunneling and bulk excavation works started in 1988. The works were halted in late 1990 after the UN sanctions due to Iraq's invasion of Kuwait, and with the onset of the Gulf War, as well as consequential poor security environment. By June 1990, the first stage of the construction was complete, the diversion of the Great Zab, facilitated by an incomplete high clay core rockfill cofferdam, which was to become part of the upstream shoulder of the main dam, and through two large diversion tunnels. The dam project involves a large underground power house and transformers chamber, largely completed into the left abutment. The power intake and spillway intake are also located on the left abutment, with associated tunnels through the limestone. Those tunnels emerge through one structure on the left abutment, downstream of the dam, augmented by a plunge pool structure. A system of drainage tunnels was excavated into the left and right abutments at the foot of the main dam. The Bekhme Dam is designed with a central clay core, two upstream and downstream filter zones, and rockfill shoulders (limestone). The upstream and downstream faces of the dam are designed with gradients of 1 vertical to 2.5 horizontal. The dam project was expected to be completed in 1992, resulting in a reservoir with a capacity of and a surface area of . There is a potential for a pumped-storage scheme (several gigawatts) to be constructed on the left abutment; that still requires further optimisation and investigation. After the Gulf War, US$175 million worth of equipment were reported to have been stolen by Kurds in the area. One of the tunnels of Bekhme Dam Current project As early as July 2007, the Kurdistan Regional Government has expressed interest in finishing the Bekhme Dam in order to produce hydro-electricity and store needed water. However, with a drought in Iraq, in 2008 the Government of Iraq expressed concern with the Kurdistan Regional Government over dam construction that may lead to water shortages in southern Iraq. In addition, around 20,000 people would be relocated along with the probable flooding of the stone age Shanidar Cave and the 11th century BC village Zawi Chemi Shanidar.Report I Bekhme Dam, from archive.org Despite this, the need for water storage in Iraq is important and in August 2008, US$33 million was spent on preparatory works for continued construction.

Located some 6‚Äì7 miles northwest of Guntersville with scenic bluffs overlooking much of Guntersville Lake and the dam, wooded areas and open fields. The community contains 4 churches, 3 cemeteries, fire house, community center, golf course, horse farm, boarding stables, farmers, chicken houses, and more. Up into the 1980s, the area was mainly farmland, but this changed as the agricultural lifestyle was largely abandoned. Today, the area is made up of mainly subdivisions and small plots of land, with very few traces of old home places for which it was once known. Many of the first families still have descendants living on Georgia Mountain and most of the surviving founding members are buried in one of the cemeteries. Residents come from all walks of life, and homes range from the very basic to the most elegant. Prior to the American Civil War Ira Roe Foster had purchased about 6 miles of river frontage (including the present Guntersville Dam site) and a large portion of Brindlee Mountain. Following the War, many Southerners found themselves in unpleasant and difficult circumstances. Many had lost their money and households, and that part of Georgia through which General Sherman's army had marched was almost completely devastated. Many families decided to move on and try to start a new life elsewhere. Ira Roe Foster was one of those and he decided to move his family to Alabama around 1867. He invited a number of friends to join him and they settled on that part of Brindlee Mountain which lies east of 'Long Hollow' and was at that time largely uninhabited wilderness. They called the area \\"Georgia Mountain\\", in honor of the beloved state they had left behind. While there appear to have been inhabitants of some parts of Georgia Mountain for some years prior to the Civil War, its main settlement and its name came afterwards. The 11 families who migrated with the Fosters were the Alford, Bolding, Brown, Eubanks, Evans, Fielding, Hilburn, McMinn, Malone, Rainwater and Turner families. They settled an area that until then had been an uninhabited wilderness, and was decidedly rural despite being situated just a few miles from Guntersville. Ira Foster established a landing on the river near the present Guntersville Dam known as \\"Foster's Landing\\" and built a sawmill to provide the lumber needed for building homes and businesses. A road led from Foster's Landing up to the top of the mountain. For several years all the settlement's supplies came on the Tennessee River to the landing and were carried up the mountain on wagons via that route ‚Äì that road has ceased to exist. Many of the residents on the mountain farmed the rich \\"bottoms\\" along the river (now under Guntersville Lake), going up and down the mountain daily. The road was finally extended down the other side of the mountain to Guntersville when Foster requested Gov. Brown of Georgia to send him an engineer. The engineer was Albert M. Ayres, Sr. who married Foster's daughter and made the mountain his home. That road was eventually paved in the 1960s with only one curve removed, and continues to be one of the main roads to access the mountain. Those families decided they must organize a church and establish a school. The first meeting house was built of logs near where the Mt. Carmel cemetery is today. They were officially recognized in June 1867 and named Mt. Carmel Baptist Church. That name was chosen because it was the name of the church many of the organizers had belonged to in Georgia. Another 'meeting house' was built somewhere around 1872 and was used by both the Baptists and Methodists. During the early years that building also served as a community meeting place. Eventually a school was built with two classrooms. A third room was added later. It operated until sometime in the 1950s. The Methodist Church was organized on Georgia Mountain in 1872 and was first known as Mason's Chapel, though the name has since been changed to Bethel Church, and somewhere along the way, Grace Church was formed. At one time there was a post office on Georgia Mountain called \\"Beard\\". Arthur Campbell Beard had come from Pennsylvania in the early 1800s and had settled Beard's Bluff on the Tennessee River just west of Guntersville (later known as Street's Bluff). Crank-type phones arrived on the mountain sometime in the first half of the twentieth century. Electric power was first run to the mountain by Alabama Power in the 1930s. In 1947 power came from Arab Electric. Water lines finally arrived from Arab Water in 1973-74. Natural gas arrived 2011-12. In 2012 the main roads on the mountain are paved and growth continues ReferencesExternal links *Mt.

Its members are five musicians of the ‚ÄúGewandhausorchester Leipzig‚Äù, the MDR Symphony Orchestra, and the ‚ÄúStaatskapelle Halle‚Äù. The group play music from every musical epoch and nearly every style.  History  ‚ÄûQuintessenz ‚Äì Leipziger Querfl√∂tenensemble‚Äú, was founded in 1996. The British a cappella-band ‚ÄûKing‚Äôs Singers‚Äú, and the ‚ÄûBamboozles‚Äú, a flute quintet of five students of Trevor Wye, served as examples. The idea of an ensemble that consisted of musicians who played the same instruments in different voices excited the five flutists from Leipzig. At first ‚ÄúQuintessenz‚Äù met in private to play Jazz. As they all are trained as classical and not as jazz flutists they soon developed a characteristic sound. From the beginning everything they played had their classical education as basis. Out of lack of literature for flute quintets ‚ÄúQuintessenz‚Äù began to arrange their own musical pieces. For that they did not only use music for quintets of different kinds but also adapted symphonic pieces, piano literature, or completely different music. Thus they began to compile their own programmes. In 1999 ‚ÄúQuintessenz‚Äù recorded their first CD, followed by three more. 2006 ‚ÄúQuintessenz‚Äù were invited by Trevor Wye to the flute festival of the British Flute Society in Manchester. Since then they performed at various international festivals, inter alia in New York City in August 2009, hosted by the National Flute Association of the United States. A few years ago ‚ÄúQuintessenz‚Äù started to focus on the support of young flutists. In cooperation with the regional music council (‚ÄúLandesmusikrat‚Äù) and the ‚ÄúJeunesses Musicales Germany‚Äù they hosted several workshops for flute chamber-music.  Programmes  Because of their very own style of music the ‚ÄúQuintessenz‚Äù programmes also have a special character. There is always a main topic or theme the music can be subordinated to. This theme can either be music or composer related (‚ÄúMozartimento‚Äù), but also country (‚ÄúAmerica!‚Äù) or literature related (‚ÄúTour de France‚Äù). In addition to that ‚ÄúQuintessenz‚Äù have several special programmes that combine music and poetry (‚ÄúHymn to fish‚Äù, ‚ÄúAll those birds‚Äù). For those they are assisted by professional stage actors who recite poems to the respective topic. A special form of these programmes is the ‚Äúmusical promenade‚Äù. The audience is invited to walk through the landscape together with ‚ÄúQuintessenz‚Äù playing music at different places. Additional programmes are for example ‚ÄúA Midsummer Night's Dream‚Äù ‚Äì the programme for the Mendelssohn year 2009. Parts of the music of the ‚ÄúMidsummer Night's Dream‚Äù are the frame, replenished with pieces about summer, night, and elves.  Members = Anna Garzuly  Anna Garzuly was born in Szombathely, Hungary.

Carmel Hospital Mt. Carmel Hospital was founded in 1903 by the Sisters of St. Joseph of Wichita, Kansas under the direction of Mother Mary Bernard Sheridan,About Us incidentally the same year as the founding of Pittsburg State University. The hospital's original mission was to serve miners and their families with its first 20-bed facility located between Pittsburg, Kansas and Frontenac, Kansas. After expansion in the 1960s, further growth was impeded by under-mining on the then-current hospital site. A community fundraising drive was initiated, and in 1971, the new five-floor, 188-bed facility at Rouse and Centennial was occupied.Taken from hospital web site Mt. Carmel Medical Center In 1995 the first major expansion of the Mt. Carmel Medical Center building came in the form of the Mt. Carmel Regional Cancer Center, a facility that has since been designated as a Community Cancer Center by the National Cancer Institute, the only cancer center in the region to receive the designation. In that same year the hospital became a part of the newly formed Via Christi Health System as the healing ministries of its sponsoring organization, the Sisters of St. Joseph of Wichita, Kansas and the Sisters of the Sorrowful Mother, also of Wichita, joined forces.Formation of Via Christi Health System Mt. Carmel Regional Medical Center The name of the hospital was changed to Mt. Carmel Regional Medical Center (MCRMC) in 2001 to reflect the facility's increasing presence as a regional health provider. Via Christi Hospital: Pittsburg In October 2009 Via Christi Health Systems, Mt. Carmel's parent company, announced it would be re-branding MCRMC as Via Christi beginning in 2010, while preserving the historic Mt. Carmel name with a new street address of 1 Mt.

The film was the second on-screen collaboration of Cruise and Diaz, following the 2001 film Vanilla Sky. Diaz plays June Havens, a classic car restorer who unwittingly gets caught up with the eccentric secret agent Roy Miller, played by Cruise, who is on the run from the CIA. The film's investors offset funding costs by paying Cruise a lower advance fee and providing him a share of revenue only after the financiers were repaid their investment in the production. Filming took place in several locations, mainly in several cities located in Massachusetts, while other scenes were filmed in Spain and parts of Austria. Knight and Day was released in the United States on June 24, 2010. The film received mixed reviews from film critics, with praise for the performances of Cruise and Diaz but criticism was aimed at its script. It grossed over $261 million worldwide, recouping its $117 million budget. The film was remade in Bollywood as Bang Bang!, released October 2, 2014, with Hrithik Roshan and Katrina Kaif in the lead roles. Plot Returning home to Boston from buying car parts in Wichita, June Havens (Cameron Diaz) collides with Roy Miller (Tom Cruise) at the airport, twice, and is bumped to a later flight. CIA Agent John Fitzgerald (Peter Sarsgaard), believing June is working with Roy, puts her back on the plane. While June is in the plane‚Äôs restroom, Roy subdues the passengers and flight crew, all agents sent by Fitzgerald, and crash-lands the plane in a cornfield. He drugs the shocked June, warning that agents will come after her. Waking at home, June prepares for her sister April‚Äôs (Maggie Grace) wedding, and learns she wants to sell their father's 1966 Pontiac GTO tri-power, which June had planned to restore as a wedding gift. June is picked up by Fitzgerald and his agents. Roy appears, killing numerous agents in a highway chase and rescuing June. She flees to her ex-boyfriend Rodney (Marc Blucas), a firefighter, before Roy arrives and pretends to take June hostage. Roy persuades June that she is safer with him, and reveals that he is in possession of the Zephyr, a perpetual energy battery; he had been assigned to guard its inventor, Simon Feck, until Fitzgerald tried to steal the battery, framing Roy. In Brooklyn, June and Roy discover Feck has gone into hiding but left Roy a clue that he is in the Alps. They are attacked by henchmen sent by Spanish arms dealer Antonio Quintana (Jordi Moll√†). Drugged again, June drifts in and out of consciousness as they are captured and then escape to Roy‚Äôs off- the-grid island. Accepting a call from her sister, June accidentally leads Quintana's men to the hideaway. Escaping Quintana‚Äôs unmanned aerial assault vehicle in a helicopter, Roy knocks June out to circumvent her fear of flying. June wakes up aboard a train in Austria, where Roy has reunited with Simon, and they manage to kill Bernard (Falk Hentschel), an assassin hired by Quintana. After checking into a hotel in Salzburg, June follows Roy to a meeting with Naomi (Gal Gadot), Quintana's henchwoman, where he offers to sell the Zephyr. Fitzgerald and C.I.A. Director Isabel George (Viola Davis) find June and reveal that Roy used her at the airport to smuggle the Zephyr past security. Heartbroken, June leads the C.I.A. to the hotel. Fleeing across the rooftops, Roy is shot and falls into the river with the Zephyr. Simon is kidnapped from C.I.A. custody by Fitzgerald, the real traitor, to be delivered to Quintana in Spain. Returning home, June attends her sister‚Äôs wedding, and visits an address Roy had been monitoring, where she meets his parents and learns his real name is Matthew Knight. They believe their son, an Army sergeant and Eagle Scout, was killed in action, and have won various lotteries and sweepstakes they do not remember entering. Leaving a message on her own answering machine declaring that she has the Zephyr, June is taken by Quintana's men to Sevilla. Drugged with a prototype truth serum, June explains that Roy's deal with Quintana was meant to alert the C.I.A. so June would be returned home safely in time for the wedding. Roy, tracking Fitzgerald, rescues June, and leads Quintana and his men on a car chase. Quintana is killed by a bull stampede, and Roy trades Fitzgerald the Zephyr for Simon. Fitzgerald shoots Simon anyway, but Roy takes the bullet instead. Simon reveals that the battery is unstable, and it explodes, killing Fitzgerald. Roy is hospitalized in Washington, D.C., where George tells him June has moved on, and welcomes him back to the C.I.A.; however, George‚Äôs coded language ‚Äì as Roy explained to June earlier ‚Äì reveals that he will be killed. June, disguised as a nurse, drugs Roy and breaks him out of the hospital. Waking up in June‚Äôs rebuilt GTO, Roy and June drive toward Cape Horn, and Roy's parents unexpectedly receive their own tickets to Cape Horn.

More than 12 writers contributed to the film. The Writers Guild of America, West, decided that due to this large number of contributors, only Patrick O'Neill, who had worked on the beginning layout of the script, would get credit. Other writers that worked on the film's script included Scott Frank, Laeta Kalogridis, Ted Griffin, Dana Fox, and Simon Kinberg. Casting The film changed lead cast members multiple times while the production was mired in \\"development hell\\". Prior to finalizing on actors Tom Cruise and Cameron Diaz, when the film was titled Wichita, comedian and actor Adam Sandler was offered a starring role in the film; he declined, saying, \\"I just don't see me with a gun.\\" Wichita was developed under production at Revolution Studios; the film was later moved to Sony Pictures. At Sony Pictures, actors Chris Tucker and Eva Mendes were slated to portray the two lead roles in the film; it was titled Trouble Man and intended as a romantic vehicle film for the two actors. After Tucker and Mendes dropped out of the lead roles, Diaz signed on to the film with Sony Pictures, and actor Gerard Butler met with production staff regarding starring opposite Diaz. Butler instead decided to take on the lead role in the film The Bounty Hunter, opposite actress Jennifer Aniston. Tom Cruise, who at the time was auditioning for parts in five films, including Salt, and The Tourist, decided he wanted to star in Knight and Day, and he wanted to modify the role of the male lead character with his own ideas. Financing The film's production partners, New Regency and Dune Entertainment, offset financing for the film by paying Tom Cruise a lower advance fee than he normally received. Cruise previously normally received $20 million or higher in an advance fee, but he only received $11 million for Knight and Day. Cruise also agreed not to receive first-dollar gross, which was customary for him. That meant that Cruise would not receive a share of the film's revenue until Knight and Day funding investors had first gained back their investment in the production. In total, production costs for the film exceeded $125 million. Filming Principal photography began in mid-September 2009 in Boston and Bridgewater, Massachusetts. Airport terminal scenes were filmed at Worcester Regional Airport. Filming also took place in Melrose, Danvers, and New Bedford, Massachusetts. Filming was also done in Spanish cities Seville and Cadiz, and the Austrian city of Salzburg. Soundtrack The Black Eyed Peas recorded a theme song for the film, titled \\"Someday\\".Black Eyed Peas new Song Someday ('Knight and Day' theme) for Upcoming Tom Cruise/Cameron Diaz Movie Marketing Knight and Day had been set for a June 25, 2010, release date, but FOX moved its debut up two days to June 23; in the face of poor initial tracking numbers. The New York Observer analyzed the marketing for the film, which included an attempt at pushing a \\"viral video\\" of the two main stars; journalist Christopher Rosen commented on the desperation level of the publicity campaign, \\"the marketing for this thing has seemed more intrusive and desperate than any other big-ticket release in some time.\\" Film producer Don Carmody commented negatively regarding the film's trailer, calling it \\"dull\\", and said the film would not do well because of the age of its two stars, \\"Cameron Diaz I think was a star, but she‚Äôs no longer a star. Some of those stars are getting a little up there (in age).\\" The Hollywood Reporter noted that \\"potential viewers remain startlingly indifferent to whether they actually end up seeing it. And attention thus far is still drawn mostly by those under 25, which indicates that the fans who grew up with star Tom Cruise have moved on.\\" FOX attempted to increase word of mouth advertising for the film by showing a sneak preview on June 19, 2010; alternate link the Los Angeles Times reported the same day that pre-release surveys determined that the film was likely to become a commercial flop. Projections indicated that the film would only make $20 million at the box office; much less than the film production cost of $125 million. alternate link FOX production President Emma Watts said of the film's commercial prospects, \\"We aren't exactly where we hoped we would be.\\" The Los Angeles Times noted that \\"... Cruise and Diaz are not as popular with younger moviegoers, who often drive big opening weekends in the summer. ... Among teenage and college-age males, the movie is barely registering, according to people who have seen the survey results.\\" New York Magazine reported the film was \\"tracking miserably\\" prior to its first week. New York Magazine reported that \\"one of the film's biggest handicaps: its star, Tom Cruise\\". A FOX official commented to New York Magazine regarding the film's pre-release polling data, \\"at those numbers, we can‚Äôt open the movie right now. Hopefully, they‚Äôll change in the next few days.\\" Upon hearing that tracking data on June 22, 2010, showed the film was not likely to produce revenue over $30 million in its first five days on screen, a FOX executive told TheWrap he was \\"confounded\\", and commented, \\"Tracking says one thing, but our sneak previews this weekend said something totally different. ... but if you look at the empirical data, we‚Äôre nowhere.\\" New York Magazine reported that the day prior to the film's release, a long scene from Knight and Day was made available on iTunes, in an attempt to improve the lackluster 28‚Äì31% \\"definite interest\\" level of the movie. After results were reported from the film's initial debut, FOX distribution executive Bruce Synder commented to The Hollywood Reporter, \\"It's an adult movie opening on a Wednesday, but we opened it there and snuck it on Saturday because we believe the word-of-mouth will be good, so we're set for a pretty good opening weekend. Remember, it's an original, adult movie, which we expect will run for quite a while.\\" Alternative versions An \\"extended cut\\", which adds eight minutes of footage mostly extending scenes and a new opening that better establishes June Haven's profession as a car restorer, was released on Video On Demand in North America. it had not been released in DVD region 1, though it had been released in regions 2, 3, and 4. Reception=Box office Knight and Day grossed $76.4 million in the United States and Canada and $185.5 million in other territories for a worldwide total of $261.9 million. It performed poorly at the box office in its debut, with a take of US$3.8 million the day after its initial June 23, 2010, release, from ticket sales in the United States and Canada. This was much less than the film Toy Story 3, which earned $13 million at the box office on the same day. Knight and Day did not place within the top 50 all-time Wednesday film openings. An analysis of the opening day results by Box Office Mojo noted it was the worst attended action film debut for Tom Cruise since his appearance in the 1986 Legend. It was the lowest-grossing opening day for Cruise in a leading role since his performance in the 1992 film Far and Away. Cruise's last starring role prior to Knight and Day, in the 2008 film Valkyrie, generated $8.5 million on its opening day. The previous film with Cameron Diaz and Cruise as the lead roles, Vanilla Sky, garnered $8.9 million on its opening day. Moira Macdonald of The Seattle Times characterized the film's initial revenue results as \\"a box-office disappointment\\"; Lou Lumenick of New York Post commented, \\"Not great numbers\\"; journalist Roger Friedman noted for Hollywood News, \\"Bad reviews didn‚Äôt help. 'K&D;' has registered only 52% on Rotten Tomatoes. Even those reviews counted as positive weren‚Äôt so good. They were stretching.\\"; alternate link Nicole Sperling of Entertainment Weekly noted, \\"audiences just aren‚Äôt showing up the way Fox might have hoped\\"; and Ben Fritz of Los Angeles Times called the film's debut a \\"soft\\" opening, and commented, \\"It wasn't a good first day or night at the box office for 'Knight and Day.'\\" The film's revenues dropped nine percent on its second day of release, earning $3.5 million in ticket sales. During the same period that revenues dropped for Knight and Day, ticket sales for Toy Story only fell by three percent, The Karate Kid dropped by six percent; while other films increased revenues at the same time, including, Shrek Forever After, Sex and the City 2, Get Him to the Greek, Killers, and Robin Hood. In its first weekend, Knight and Day was paired up against Grown Ups, a comedy film starring Adam Sandler, Kevin James, Chris Rock, David Spade and Rob Schneider. The Friday of its first weekend after release, Knight and Day took third place at the box office, behind both Grown Ups and Toy Story 3. The film brought in a total of $6.4 million on its third day of release. Critical response On Rotten Tomatoes, the film has an approval rating of 52% based on 229 reviews and an average rating of 5.56/10. The site's critical consensus reads, \\"It's pure formula, but thanks to its breezy pace and a pair of charming performances from Tom Cruise and Cameron Diaz, Knight and Day offers some agreeably middle-of-the-road summer action.\\" On Metacritic, the film has a score of 46 out of 100 based on 38 critics, indicating \\"mixed or average reviews\\". Audiences polled by CinemaScore gave the film an average grade of \\"B+\\" on an A+ to F scale. The film received a negative review in Variety, with critic Justin Chang characterizing the film as \\"a high-energy, low-impact caper-comedy that labors to bring a measure of wit, romance and glamour to an overworked spy-thriller template\\". Kirk Honeycutt of The Hollywood Reporter summarized his review with, \\"Bottom Line: Logic and plausibility take a holiday in this nonstop actioner that counts on stars Tom Cruise and Cameron Diaz to sell the nonsense.\\" alternate link Honeycutt wrote of the writing, \\"the script is too lazy to develop any of its characters ‚Äì and that includes the leads\\", and commented, \\"laziness permeates the film from the inexplicable escapes to the neglected romance\\". Knight and Day received a rating of one and a half stars from a review by Michael Phillips in the Chicago Tribune; which criticized multiple aspects of the film, including its script, directing, cinematography, set pieces, and action sequences. alternate link Phillips concluded, \\"A 21st Century Charade pumped up on all the wrong steroids, 'Knight and Day' may well suffice for audiences desperate for the bankable paradox known as the predictable surprise, and willing to overlook a galumphing mediocrity in order to concentrate on matters of dentistry.\\" Lexi Feinberg of Big Picture Big Sound gave the film a rating of one and a half stars, and characterized it as an \\"asinine, action-adventure dud\\", with a \\"stupid plot\\". Feinberg commented, \\"'Knight and Day' is a ludicrous, large- scale failure\\". In a review of the film for the New York Post, critic Lou Lumenick rated Knight and Day with one and a half out of four stars. Lumenick wrote, \\"this is a big, dumb summer movie with no apparent ambition other than plugging a hole in a studio‚Äôs schedule because its faded star happened to be available for a few weeks.\\" American film critic and professor Emanuel Levy was critical of the film's writing, calling it a \\"mindless flick\\"; he noted, \\"The story moves at a breakneck speed, as if to conceal the incongruities in the storytelling.\\" Levy gave the film a grade of \\"C\\", and commented, \\"Preposterously plotted, the saga is dominated by long, energetic, uneven action sequences, but it lacks any logic and pays minimal attention to characterization. Repetitious in structure, and with humor that more often than not misses the mark, 'Knight and Day' is characterized by nihilistic violence and amoral tone, which wouldn't have mattered had the movie been witty or fun to watch.\\" Simon Abrams of Slant Magazine gave the film a rating of two stars out of four, and commented of the film's director and writer, \\"Clearly O'Neill and Mangold are trying to give viewers what producers would undoubtedly like to sell as 'something for everybody,' but there's no consistency to the thing and no chemistry whatsoever between Cruise and Diaz, making the alternating tug-of-war between girly and manly elements of the film seem extraordinarily forced.\\" In a review published in The Victoria Advocate, Robert Philpot of McClatchy Newspapers called the movie \\"disposable\\", and singled out the film's script as its \\"biggest problem\\", commenting that it \\"feels lazy right from its lame-pun title\\". The Miami Herald film critic Rene Rodriguez wrote that there was \\"no chemistry between Cruise and Diaz\\", and commented regarding Cruise's acting, \\"Tom Cruise spends much of 'Knight and Day' looking as if he's waiting for someone to pour casting mold over his head to make an action figure.\\" Entertainment Weekly film critic Lisa Schwarzbaum gave Knight and Day a grade of \\"C+\\", and compared it to the 2010 film Killers starring Katherine Heigl and Ashton Kutcher, \\"The producers assume that audience interest in movie stars is bigger than audience interest in characters. The conclusion is overdetermined, since Roy and June are such flimsy constructions. ... At least they're not Katherine Heigl and Ashton Kutcher in Killers.\\" Colin Covert of Star Tribune made a similar comparison, \\"The film looks unambitious, like a remake of 'Killers,' the Ashton Kutcher- Katherine Heigl guns-and-giggles toss-off everyone has already forgotten, but with bigger stunts and more star wattage.\\" The film received a rating of two stars out of four from critic Peter Howell in the Toronto Star; the reviewer commented, \\"There is supposed to be romance in Knight and Day ‚Äî and Diaz is up for it ‚Äî but Cruise still looks as if he‚Äôs taken charisma lessons from Al Gore.\\" In a review for The Huffington Post, critic Marshall Fine observed, \\"the movie bubbles happily for almost an hour before it flags\\". Robert Bell of Exclaim! wrote of the script, \\"Sure, things slow down a bit around the midway point, making it clear that there is very little going on here aside from cheesy escapist fantasy, but things quickly pick up again, engaging us in the moment of a movie that knows exactly what mainstream trash cinema should be.\\" In a review for the Orlando Sentinel, critic Roger Moore commented, \\"The blase plot devices (a gadget, the nerdy guy who invented it), the bland villains, the too-fast dash through exotic locales, don't matter so long as Cruise and Diaz click and spark their scenes ‚Äì chases and embraces ‚Äì to life. And Cruise, hurling himself at this as if his Mission: Impossible future and indeed his whole career depended on it, makes sure they do.\\" The Wall Street Journal critic Joe Morgenstern commented, \\"'Knight and Day' woke me up to just how awful some summer entertainments have become. It isn't that the film is harmful, except to moviegoers' wallets and movie lovers' morale, but that it is truly phenomenal for the purity of its incoherence.\\" Writing for the Chicago Sun-Times, Roger Ebert rated the movie 3 stars out of 4 and wrote, \\"'Knight and Day' aspires to the light charm of a romantic action comedy like 'Charade' or 'Romancing the Stone,' but would come closer if it dialed down the relentless action. The romance part goes without saying after a Meet Cute contrived in an airport, and the comedy seems to generate naturally between Tom Cruise and Cameron Diaz. But why do so many summer movies find it obligatory to inflict us with CGI overkill? I'd sorta rather see Diaz and Cruise in action scenes on a human scale, rather than have it rubbed in that for long stretches, they're essentially replaced by animation.\\" Ty Burr of The Boston Globe stated, \\"The movie‚Äôs a piece of high-octane summer piffle: stylish, funny, brainless without being too obnoxious about it, and Cruise is its manic animating principle.\\" Writing for the Associated Press, Christy Lemire commented, \\"Cruise's presence also helps keep things light, breezy and watchable when the action ‚Äì and the story itself ‚Äì spin ridiculously out of control.\\" Bill Goodykoontz of The Arizona Republic observed, \\"Mangold, working from a script by Patrick O'Neill, accelerates events in a way that is either a perfect representation of how current action films are made or a demonstration of everything that's wrong with movies today.

They were members of the Philipps family of St Brides, Pembrokeshire as indicated by the spelling of their surname, and also the heraldic emblem and motto on the bank notes. Samuel Levi Philips, the founder of the Haverfordwest Bank, was one of the promoters of the Milford and Pembrokeshire Bank and in his will he bequeathed the sum of ¬£1000 to his first son, Philip Philips, ‚Äòadvanced as my part of the capital joint stock in the new Milford Bank, as one of the co-partners therein.‚Äô This bank was probably the Milford and Pembrokeshire Bank. However, it was his second son, Nathaniel Philips of Slebech, who became the ‚Äòmainstay‚Äô of the Bank. He was Thomas Philipps brother in law. The Bank ran into trouble due to the apparent incompetence of Thomas Philipps. He became involved in unsuccessful banking and trading ventures, and the bank also got entangled in Pembrokeshire politicsMilford Bank papers, Slebech collection, National Library of Wales As a result, the Bank collapsed in July 1810, fifteen years before the Panic of 1825, with outstanding bank notes in the sum of ¬£22,289. Emigration After the Bank‚Äôs collapse, Thomas Philipps, then aged 44, together with his wife and seven children, emigrated to South Africa at the head of a group of Pembrokeshire families, comprising 47 persons in all. They sailed in the ‚ÄòKennersley Castle‚Äô from Bristol, in 1819, and reached Table Bay in March 1820, settling on an arm of the Bush River, at a place which Philipps called Lampeter, and which was later erroneously called New Bristol.

The Argentine writer Julio Cort√°zar often used this method to write, as he called it \\"the moment of maximum creativity\\".  Concept  In √âtat second, the consciousness is clouded so that two personalities that are very different override each other with one appearing in place of the other. The personalities involved one that is normal while the other is aberrant and they follow each other in successions. In psychology, √âtat second is also referred to as the \\"new state\\" in the condition called alternating personality. This is manifested in the mental state of hysterics.

Route description The route starts on SR-83 east of Lampo Junction travelling northeast. After about , the route starts to \\"stairstep\\", alternately going north and east through Penrose and Thatcher, before settling on an easterly direction through Bothwell. Soon after, the route intersects I-84 at Bothwell Junction, passes under I-15, passes through Tremonton and Haws Corner Junction and ending at SR-38 in Deweyville at the base of the Wellsville Mountains. History SR-102 was originally designated in 1931 as the road from Deweyville to Haws Corner. In 1969, the route was extended westward through Tremonton to SR-83 east of Lampo Junction (this stretch of road was formerly part of SR-3). Signage used from 1966 to 1977 on SR-30 In 1966, the counties in northern Utah requested that the State Road Commission designate a single route number to run east-west across that part of the state. This route overlapped SR-102 between Deweyville and I-84. For this new route, the number SR-30 was selected, but there were no legislative description changes of the highways. Instead, the old route numbers were kept and marked on small, rectangular signs below the SR-30 shields. In the 1977 renumbering, the legislative description of this new route was changed to SR-30, resulting in SR-102's eastern terminus being moved to I-84. In 1989, the commission resolved that, once I-15 was completed north of Tremonton, SR-30 would be rerouted to replace SR-129, with SR-102 being extended back to Deweyville.

The game was released on May 11, 2010 for Microsoft Windows and May 12, 2010 on consoles, with the exception of the PlayStation 3 release in North America, which was released on May 18, 2010. The Microsoft Windows release is not available in Europe. Rocket Knight is a revival of the Sparkster series, which first began with Rocket Knight Adventures. The game is a sequel to the Sega Genesis game Sparkster: Rocket Knight Adventures 2, and not a remake of Rocket Knight Adventures. Gameplay The game is shown at a slightly zoomed out perspective, allowing less dangerous use of the jetpack, and uses the auto- filling power meter from Sparkster: Rocket Knight Adventures 2, which powers both the jetpack and sword attacks featured in Rocket Knight Adventures (neither Rocket Knight Adventures nor the SNES Sparkster game have an auto- power meter). Sparkster cannot perform consecutive boosts, but can temporarily hover in midair. There are other tweaks, such as Sparkster only bouncing off walls when he hits them at a 45 degree angle. He is also able to shoot short range projectiles and perform a drill attack which allows him to break through certain surfaces. Sparkster's attack range is also complete, allowing him to deflect certain projectiles with his sword. Like previous entries, there will be side-scrolling shooting segments, where Sparkster can charge his shots and use his jetpack to quickly avoid obstacles. There are several items and power ups along the way, with point and life bonuses earned for collecting all of a certain item in a level. Plot Sparkster, upon his return from fighting the Gedol empire in Sparkster: Rocket Knight Adventures 2, is surprised to find that the Devotindos empire, the pigs that he had fought previously in Rocket Knight Adventures, had taken up residence in the Kingdom of Zephyrus along with the opossums inhabitants under permission granted by the Zephyrus king performed to the General Sweinhart, a war veteran from the previous war between Zepyrus and Devotindos. With his warning claims being ignored by the Zephyrus king, Sparkster decides to move elsewhere to live with his family for a while, assuming he was no longer as useful as he was. Fifteen years later, a new threat to Zephyrus has arrived. Sparkster is surprised to find the pigs fighting alongside the possums against an army of wolves, with Sparkster's nemesis, Axel Gear, acting as Rocket Knight in his absence. Suspecting something may be amiss, Sparkster decides to put on his gear and head back into the fray, ready to fight the wolf army. However, when Sparkster eventually defeats the leader of the Wolf army in their homeland, General Sweinhart turns the Devotindos empire once again against the opossums, their one other threat eliminated. Sparkster must return to Zephyrus to save his kingdom and defeat the Devotindos army. Development When producer Tomm Hulett joined Konami, he decided to work on a pitch for a revival for Sparkster, which was accepted after two years and four pitches. Hulett claims, \\"it was really a matter of reworking the concept ‚Äì making the right pitch at the right time,\\" with various recent franchise revivals receiving positive responses at the time. Hulett also said that Konami thought Climax Studios were the best pick partly due to their facial animation technology, allowing Sparkster to produce expressions respective to his 16-bit counterparts. A trailer was released on October 9, 2009. Reception IGN gave the game a score of 7.5, praising the inventive platforming but showing concern for the high price point. Game Informer gave the game a score of 8 out of 10. GamesRadar gave the game 7/10, praising its mechanics but criticising its fluctuating difficulty, along with the high price point. 1up.com gave it a C+ grade, criticising its lack of variety.

He identifies himself as a socionist and is the founder and chairperson of the Humanitarian Socionics School in Kyiv, Ukraine.  Work  Gulenko has emerged as the one of leading figures in socionics. He is the 2nd most cited socionist https://scholar.google.com.ua/citations?user=GFuquGAAAAAJ&hl;=en and is respected for making a number of important discoveries. Gulenko has offered a number of hypotheses, including the \\"DCNH\\" subtype system, the first such system to be empirically validated.Boukalov, A.V. (2004). 16-component model of TIM and Socionics. Socionics, Mentology, and Personality Psychology, 3. Gulenko considers himself an analytical psychologist and a disciple of Carl Gustav Jung. In his work he has sought to bring clarity to Jung's assertions and to show how socionics can justify them. He is also credited with Alexander Bukalov and Gregory Reinin, as a chief player in the later developments and standardization of socionics theory after Au≈°ra Augustinaviƒçi≈´tƒó.  DCNH  In 1995, Gulenko proposed a series of sub-categorizations to account for variations in behavior between people of the same type. According to Gulenko, these categorizations are necessary because functional strength, represented in terms of frequency of usage, can differ between functions. (cite) The DCNH is itself an extension of an earlier subtype system, also proposed by Gulenko, which distinguished between \\"accepting\\" and \\"producing\\" subtypes.  Other systems  Gulenko has proposed other extensions to socionics beyond DCNH. In a 1990 paper, Gulenko proposed the existence of 16 \\"counter-types\\" opposite the sixteen identified by Augustinaviciute.Gulenko, V. Quantity of Types in Socioanalysis. (Russian title: –ö–æ–ª–∏—á–µ—Å—Ç–≤–æ —Ç–∏–ø–æ–≤ –≤ —Å–æ—Ü–∏–æ–∞–Ω–∞–ª–∏–∑–µ) November 1990. accessed from: http://socionics.kiev.ua/articles/methodology/numsoctip/ Gulenko argues that the functions of these types process information differently and have different behavior and thinking from the other 16. In 1989, Alexander Bukalov cited the human shadow or inner function circuit as being describable using the counter-types paradigm.Boukalov, A.V. (2004). 16-component model of TIM and Socionics.

Socionists have argued for the existence of functional \\"accentuation\\" factors since the 1980s to account for these differences. In recent years, Gulenko has published several papers on the 2nd type dimension through the Humanitarian Socionics Institute. He has concluded that it is a processor of energy, as opposed to information, and a determinant of the efficacy level of the individual when dealing with various tasks. The research stands to be highly influential, having applications in career placement, psychotherapy, and informatics. Additionally, it brings clarity to some questions concerning the function order, explaining how information aspects can be processed in apparent violation of the functional succession rules. (the violating aspects are not information aspects at all, but aspects of energy whose processing functions are unrelated to the functions of the information metabolizing type or their ordering).

A WCD allows physicians time to assess for their patient's arrhythmic risk and make appropriate plans. A WCD is lightweight and easy to wear. The WCD is non-invasive and consists of two main components ‚Äì a garment and a monitor. The garment, worn under the clothing, detects arrhythmias and delivers treatment shocks. The monitor is worn around the waist or from a shoulder strap and records the arrhythmias. The WCD continuously monitors the patient‚Äôs heart and, if a life-threatening heart rhythm is detected, it can deliver a treatment shock to restore normal heart rhythm. The entire event, from detecting a life-threatening arrhythmia to automatically delivering a treatment shock, usually occurs in less than a minute. Timely defibrillation is the single most important factor in saving an SCA victim‚Äôs life. A treatment shock must be delivered within a few minutes after an event to be effective; with each passing minute, a patient‚Äôs chances of survival drops 10 percent. The WCD does not require bystander intervention and has a 98 percent first treatment shock success rate for resuscitating patients from SCA. The WCD may be prescribed for patients at high risk of SCA following a heart attack, before or after bypass surgery or stent placement, as well as for those with cardiomyopathy or congestive heart failure that places them at particular risk. The WCD is a therapeutic option, listed along with implantable cardioverter defibrillators (ICDs), in the ACC/AHA/ESC Guidelines for the Management of Patients with Ventricular Arrhythmias and the Prevention of Sudden Cardiac Death. It is also a Class I recommendation in the International Society for Heart and Lung Transplantation Guidelines for the Care of Cardiac Transplant Candidates.  History  In 1986, M. Stephen Heilman and Larry Bowling founded Lifecor and along with a team of former Intec employees who developed the first implantable cardioverter defibrillator (ICD) began development of the WCD. The WCD was extensively tested for three years in 17 major medical centers across the United States and Europe. The clinical data collected from those trials allowed Lifecor to obtain FDA approval for use of the WCD in the United States. In 2001, the FDA approved the LifeVest wearable cardioverter defibrillator. The Lifecor business was acquired by ZOLL Medical Corporation in 2006 and Asahi Kasei in 2012. The LifeVest is currently marketed in the United States, Europe, and Israel. According to ZOLL, the company that manufactures the LifeVest, the LifeVest has been prescribed to more than 100,000 patients.  Insurance coverage in the United States  The WCD is covered by most health plans in the United States, including commercial, state, and federal plans as Durable Medical Equipment (DME) for those patients at high risk of cardiac arrest, including: * Primary prevention [Ejection fraction (EF) ‚â§35% and Myocardial Infarction (MI), Non Ischemic Cardiomyopathy (NICM), or other Dilated Cardiomyopathy (DCM)] including: ** After recent MI (Coverage during the 40-day ICD waiting period) ** Before and immediately after CABG or PTCA (Coverage during the 90-day ICD waiting period) ** Listed for cardiac transplant ** Recently diagnosed NICM (Coverage during the three-to-nine month ICD waiting period) ** New York Heart Association (NYHA) Class IV heart failure ** Terminal disease with life expectancy of less than one year * ICD indications when patient condition delays or prohibits ICD implantation * ICD explantation Assessment of usefulness The wearable cardioverter defibrillator is an option for patients who are at risk for sudden cardiac arrest (SCA) and are not candidates for or who refuse an implantable defibrillator. Not all cardiologists agree that a wearable cardioverter defibrillator is medically beneficial or necessary, compared to standard medical treatment for patients at risk for SCA. In January 2018, the FDA issued a Safety Alert related to a known malfunction in some units which could prevent the WCD from delivering a treatment shock. Zoll had previously issued (in September 2017) a recall of the WCD in an attempt to address the issue, instructing users to return the device for replacement if the device displayed a specific error message indicating the malfunction. Copies of the alert were included in all subsequent shipments of the device. The results of a randomized controlled trial were presented at the American College of Cardiology‚Äôs 67th Annual Scientific Session (in the spring of 2018). The study results apparently did not show sufficient evidence to show the WCD reduced sudden cardiac arrest in post-heart attack patients. In the group that wore the WCD, 1.6% died from sudden cardiac arrest, and in the group that didn‚Äôt wear the WCD, 2.4% died, which is arguably not a statistically significant difference.

Ibu Pertiwi ()Yayasan Kemanusiaan Ibu Pertiwi YKIP is a national personification of Indonesia and Malaysia, the allegory of Tanah Air (land and water), the motherland. Since prehistoric times, the tribes of the Indonesian archipelago or Malay Archipelago often revered earth and nature spirits as a life giving mother, a female deity of nature. After the adoption of Hinduism in the early first millennium, this mother figure was identified with Prithvi, the Hindu mother goddess of the earth, who was thus given the name \\"Pertiwi\\". In popular culture Ibu Pertiwi is a popular theme in Indonesian and Malaysian patriotic songs and poems and was mentioned in several of them, such as the song \\"Ibu Pertiwi\\", \\"Indonesia Pusaka\\" and Ibu Pertiwiku. In the national anthem \\"Indonesia Raya\\", the lyrics \\"Jadi pandu ibuku\\" (\\"[is] the scout/guide to my mother\\") is a reference to Ibu Pertiwi as the metaphorical mother of the Indonesian people. In Malaysia, \\"Ibu Pertiwiku\\" (English: My Motherland) is the official anthem of the state of Sarawak. Despite her popularity in patriotic songs and poems, her physical representations and images are rare. In nationalistic TV commercials commemorating Indonesian independence day, Ibu Pertiwi is often depicted as a beautiful Indonesian maiden lovingly nurturing Indonesian children, such as depicted in a 2017 TV commercial Hari Merdeka special. In 2017, the Ibu Pertiwi costume won the best national costume in the Miss Grand International beauty pageant. The costume was inspired by Ibu Pertiwi, the national personification of Indonesia.

Sriwijaya University (Indonesian: Universitas Sriwijaya, abbreviated as UNSRI) is a research, teaching and learning center which has contributed significantly in the development and advancement of sciences, technologies, arts and cultures. Being one of the major state universities in Indonesia, Sriwijaya University's initial campus is located in Palembang, the capital of South Sumatera Province, and the second campus is located in Indralaya, approximately 32 km away from Palembang. UNSRI obtained accreditation \\"Very Good (A)\\" awarded by the National Accreditation Board of Higher Education (Indonesian: Badan Akrediasi Nasional Perguruan Tinggi, abbreviated as BAN-PT). History UNSRI Main Gate. The idea to establish a college in South Sumatera had been around since the early 1950s and was prompted on Independence Day celebration on August 17, 1952. Initiated by some community leaders, the idea was transformed into an agreement to form a Panitia Fakultet Sumatera Selatan (South Sumatera‚Äôs Faculty Committee). At the end of August 1952, the faculty of economics was established under some considerations. Thus, South Sumatera‚Äôs Faculty Committee for Economics was set up and then managed by a foundation established on the 1st of April 1953. It was named Yayasan Perguruan Tinggi Syakhyakirti (Syakhyakirti Higher Education Foundation). This Faculty was officially opened on October 31, 1953 in a ceremony attended by Mr. Hadi, Secretary General of the Ministry of Education Teaching and Culture (KDP), Drg. M. Isa (Governor of South Sumatera), Bambang Utoyo (Commander of the Sriwijaya II TT), and Ali Gathmyr (Chairman of the Parliament of South Sumatera). The Foundation of Higher Education Syakhyakirti continued the efforts to establish the university by Organizing Panitia Penyelenggaraan Fakultas Hukum (Law Faculty Committee). It was inaugurated as ‚ÄòFaculty of Law and Public Knowledge‚Äô on November 1, 1957, coinciding with the celebration of Dies Natalis IV of Economics Faculty. The progress was sustained by the help of Military Authorities Territorial II Sriwijaya that provided financial assistance to construct a permanent building of Syakhyakirti Higher Education Foundation in Bukit Besar (now Bukit Besar‚Äôs Campus of Sriwijaya University). The cornerstone laying ceremony took place on October 31, 1957. The next effort was state validation of the existing college. With the persistent efforts of community leaders of South Sumatera, like Colonel Harun Sohar (A Commander as well as Chairman of Paperda TT II/Sriwijaya) and A. Bastari (Governor), the obstacles of building the university could be overcome. Then, in December 1959, a delegation was sent to Jakarta to meet the Minister of KDP (Mr. Moh. Yamin) where they managed to obtain the Government willingness guarantee for taking over Syakhyakirti college to become a state university. Under the Government Regulation no. 42 of 1960 dated October 29, 1960 (State Archive year 1960 no.135) Sriwijaya University was officially inaugurated on the 3rd of November 1960 and President Sukarno ceremonially signing the charter witnessed by Minister of KDP (Mr. Priyono) and several Ambassadors of the fellow countries. Drg. M Isa was appointed with Presidential Decree No. 696/M of 1960 dated 29 October 1960 as the first President of the University. To meet the development demands, Sriwijaya University planned to expand the campus area by opening an area of 712 hectares in Indralaya, Ogan Komering Ilir (Now Ogan Ilir- OI), in 1982.

It marked \\"the instantiation of modern empire\\" and was a \\"transparently masterminded piece of modern propaganda\\". The curule seat that was part of a set made for the reception of Napoleon by the corps legislatif after his coronation as emperor. Made in the workshop of Jacob-Desmalter and designed by Bernard Poyet, 1805 Napoleon wanted to establish the legitimacy of his imperial reign, with its new dynasty and new nobility. To this end, he designed a new coronation ceremony unlike that for the kings of France, which had emphasized the king's consecration (sacre) and anointment and was conferred by the archbishop of Reims in Reims Cathedral. Napoleon's was a sacred ceremony held in the great cathedral of Notre Dame de Paris in the presence of Pope Pius VII. Napoleon brought together various rites and customs, incorporating ceremonies of Carolingian tradition, the Ancien R√©gime and the French Revolution, all presented in sumptuous luxury.Dwyer 2015 On May 18, 1804, the S√©nat conservateur vested the Republican government of the French First Republic in an emperor, and preparations for a coronation followed. Napoleon's elevation to emperor was overwhelmingly approved by the French citizens in the French constitutional referendum of 1804. Among Napoleon's motivations for being crowned were to gain prestige in international royalist and Catholic circles and to lay the foundation for a future dynasty. Preparations When Pope Pius VII agreed to come to Paris to officiate at Napoleon's coronation, it was initially established that it would follow the coronation liturgy in the Roman Pontifical. However, after the Pope's arrival, Napoleon persuaded the papal delegation to allow the introduction of several French elements in the rite ‚Äì such as the singing of the Veni Creator followed by the collect of Pentecost for the monarch's entrance procession, the use of Chrism instead of the Oil of Catechumens for the anointing (although the Roman anointing prayers were used), placing the sacred oil on the head and hands rather than the right arm and back of the neck, and the inclusion of several prayers and formulas from the coronations of French kings, to bless the regalia as it was delivered. In essence, French and Roman elements were combined into a new rite unique to the occasion. Also, the special rite composed ad hoc allowed Napoleon to remain mostly seated and not kneeling during the delivery of the regalia and during several other ceremonies, and reduced his acceptance of the oath demanded by the Church in the beginning of the liturgy to one word only. Arrival of Napoleon at Notre-Dame for his coronation Not wanting to be an Old Regime monarch, Napoleon explained: \\"To be a king is to inherit old ideas and genealogy. I don't want to descend from anyone.\\" Ceremony Commemorative coin with the image of Pius VII on the obverse and Notre Dame on the reverse. Note that the date on the reverse is given both according to the Gregorian and French Revolutionary calendars. The coronation balloon According to Louis Constant Wairy, Napoleon awoke at 8:00 a.m. to the sound of a cannonade and left the Tuileries at 11:00 a.m. in a white velvet vest with gold embroidery and diamond buttons, a crimson velvet tunic and a short crimson coat with satin lining, a wreath of laurel on his brow. The number of onlookers, as estimated by Wairy, was between four and five thousand, many of whom had held their places all night through intermittent showers that cleared in the morning. The ceremony started at 9 a.m. when the Papal procession set out from the Tuileries led by a bishop on a mule holding aloft the Papal crucifix.Napoleon's Coronation as Emperor of the French Georgian Index The Pope entered Notre Dame first, to the anthem Tu es Petrus, and took his seat on a throne near the high altar. Napoleon's and Jos√©phine's carriage was drawn by eight bay horses and escorted by grenadiers √† cheval and gendarmes d'√©lite.Bernard Picart, \\"Histoire des religions et des moeurs de tous les peuples du monde, Volume 5\\", Paris, 1819, p.293 (The ormolu fitting from the carriage was owned for several years by American preservationist Jim Williams. It is seen several times in the movie Midnight in the Garden of Good and Evil.)\\"The Furnishings: Mercer House\\" - The Devoted Classicist, December 16, 2011 The two parts of the ceremony were held at different ends of Notre Dame to contrast its religious and secular facets. An unmanned balloon, ablaze with three thousand lights in an imperial crown pattern, was launched from the front of Notre Dame during the celebration. Napoleon in coronation robes by Fran√ßois G√©rard Before entering Notre Dame, Napoleon was vested in a long white satin tunic embroidered in gold thread and Josephine similarly wore a white satin empire-style dress embroidered in gold thread. During the coronation he was formally clothed in a heavy coronation mantle of crimson velvet lined with ermine; the velvet was covered with embroidered golden bees, drawn from the golden bees among the regalia that had been discovered in the Merovingian tomb of Childeric I, a symbol that looked beyond the Bourbon past and linked the new dynasty with the ancient Merovingians; the bee replaced the fleur-de-lis on imperial tapestries and garments. The mantle weighed at least eighty pounds and was supported by four dignitaries. Josephine was at the same time formally clothed in a similar crimson velvet mantle embroidered with bees in gold thread and lined with ermine, which was borne by Napoleon's three sisters. There were two orchestras with four choruses, numerous military bands playing heroic marches, and over three hundred musicians. A 400-voice choir performed Paisiello's \\"Mass\\" and \\"Te Deum\\". Because the traditional royal crown had been destroyed during the French Revolution, the so-called Crown of Napoleon, made to look medieval and called the \\"crown of Charlemagne\\" for the occasion, was waiting on the altar. While the crown was new, the sceptre was reputed to have belonged to Charles V and the sword to Philip III. Napoleon I on his Imperial Throne by Jean-Auguste-Dominique Ingres, 1806 The coronation proper began with the singing of the hymn, Veni Creator Spiritus, followed by the versicle, \\"Lord, send forth your Spirit\\" and response, \\"And renew the face of the earth\\" and the collect for the Feast of Pentecost, \\"God, who has taught the hearts of your faithful by sending them the light of your Holy Spirit,...\\" After this the prayer, \\"Almighty, everlasting God, the Creator of all...\\" During the Litany of the Saints, the Emperor and Empress remained seated, only kneeling for special petitions. The Emperor and Empress were both anointed on their heads and on both hands with chrism‚Äìthe Emperor with the prayers, \\"God, the Son of God...\\" and \\"God who established Hazael over Syria...\\", the Empress with the prayer, \\"God the Father of eternal glory...\\" ‚Äì while the antiphon Unxerunt Salomonem Sadoc Sacerdos... (\\"Zadok the priest...\\") was sung. The Mass then began. At Napoleon's request, the collect of the Blessed Virgin (as the patron of the cathedral) was said in place of the proper collect for the day. After the epistle, the articles of the imperial regalia were individually blessed, and delivered to the Emperor and Empress. The coronation of Napoleon and Josephine also differed in this respect from the pattern observed in other Western coronation rites: usually, in joint coronations of sovereign and consort, the sovereign is first anointed, invested with the regalia, crowned and enthroned, and only then is a similar but simplified rite of anointing, investiture, coronation and enthronement of the consort performed. However, for the Coronation of Napoleon and Josephine, each of those steps was performed jointly, so that Josephine was anointed immediately after Napoleon, and each item of regalia was delivered to her immediately after being given to him, a procedure that found no precedent either in the Roman Pontifical or in the French Ceremonial. Last dress of Napoleon's Coronation / Countess B√©renger, wife of Count Jean B√©renger (1767‚Äì1850) For the crowning, as recorded in the official proc√®s-verbal of the Coronation the formula Coronet vos Deus..., a variation to the plural of the traditional French formula Coronet te Deus (God crown you with a crown of glory and righteousness...) - a formula that is also proper to the English Coronation rite ‚Äì was used exclusively, instead of the Roman formula Accipe coronam... (Receive the crown...). This differed to the usage of the French royal coronations, in which both formulas ‚Äì the Roman Accipe coronam regni... and the Anglo-French Coronet te Deus... ‚Äì were recited successively. While the Pope recited the above-mentioned formula, Napoleon turned and removed his laurel wreath and crowned himself and then crowned the kneeling Jos√©phine with a small crown surmounted by a cross, which he had first placed on his own head. The crowning formula was varied to use a plural form (\\"Coronet vos...\\" instead of \\"Coronet te...\\"), precisely because the Coronation of Josephine followed immediately after the assumption of the Crown by Napoleon. As for the omitted Roman formula Accipe coronam..., which depicted the monarch as receiving his crown from the Church, its use would have clashed with Napoleon's decision to crown himself. Historian J. David Markham, who also serves as head of the International Napoleonic Society, alleged in his book Napoleon For Dummies \\"Napoleon's detractors like to say that he snatched the crown from the Pope, or that this was an act of unbelievable arrogance, but neither of those charges holds water. Napoleon was simply symbolizing that he was becoming emperor based on his own merits and the will of the people, not because of some religious consecration. The Pope knew about this move from the beginning and had no objection (not that it would have mattered).\\"Markham, J. David, Napoleon for Dummies, 2005, p. 286 British historian Vincent Cronin wrote in his book Napoleon Bonaparte: An Intimate Biography \\"Napoleon told Pius that he would be placing the crown on his own head. Pius raised no objection.\\"Cronin, Vincent, Napoleon, 1971, p. 250 At Napoleon's enthronement the Pope said, \\"May God confirm you on this throne and may Christ give you to rule with him in his eternal kingdom\\". Limited in his actions, Pius VII proclaimed further the Latin formula Vivat imperator in aeternum! (\\"May the Emperor live forever!\\"), which was echoed by the full choirs in a Vivat, followed by \\"Te Deum\\". After the Mass was finished, the Pope retired to the Sacristy, as he objected to presiding over or witnessing the civil oath that followed, due to its contents. With his hands on the Bible, Napoleon took the oath: > I swear to maintain the integrity of the territory of the Republic, to > respect and enforce respect for the Concordat and freedom of religion, > equality of rights, political and civil liberty, the irrevocability of the > sale of national lands; not to raise any tax except in virtue of the law; to > maintain the institution of Legion of Honor and to govern in the sole > interest, happiness and glory of the French people. The text was presented to Napoleon by the President of the Senate, the President of Legislature and the most senior President of the Council of State. After the oath the newly appointed herald of arms proclaimed loudly: \\"The thrice glorious and thrice august Emperor Napoleon is crowned and enthroned. Long live the Emperor!\\" During the people's acclamations Napoleon, surrounded by dignitaries, left the cathedral while the choir sang \\"Domine salvum fac imperatorem nostrum Napoleonem\\"‚Äî\\"God save our Emperor Napoleon\\". After the coronation the Emperor presented the imperial standards to each of his regiments. According to government tallies, the entire cost was over 8.5 million francs. In addition to David's paintings, a commemorative medal was struck with the reverse design by Antoine-Denis Chaudet. In 2005, a digital depiction of the coronation was made by Vaughan Hart, Peter Hicks and Joe Robson for the \\"Nelson and Napoleon\\" Exhibition at the National Maritime Museum.

Based on a short story by George M. Saville, The Kiss bears the same title as the 1896 short that \\"shocked\\" the American public by being the first motion picture to depict a couple kissing. This 1929 production is notable itself for being the last major silent film released by Metro-Goldwyn-Mayer (MGM) and the final silent performances by both Garbo and Conrad Nagel included the entire cast. Actually, this film is not entirely silent. MGM did take partial advantage of the new sound technology and released The Kiss with an orchestral score and sound effects recorded by the Movietone system. Plot The story is set in 1929 France and begins inside a museum in Lyons. There two lovers‚ÄîIrene (Greta Garbo) and Andr√© (Conrad Nagel)‚Äîfeign interest in artwork as they discuss their clandestine romance. Irene is a young woman unhappily married to Charles (Anders Randolf), a wealthy much-older businessman, whose company teeters near bankruptcy. Andr√© is a successful lawyer, unmarried, close to Irene's age, and determined to face Charles and profess his love for his wife. Despite being trapped in a loveless marriage, Irene fears her husband's violent temper and his reaction if Andr√© were to confront him. \\"He's madly jealous\\", she tells Andr√©, and insists that her situation is hopelessly bound by \\"convention\\".Dialog recorded and transcribed directly from intertitles in The Kiss, which was broadcast in its entirety on Turner Classic Movies (TCM) on August 28, 2018. Turner Broadcasting System, a subsidiary of Time Warner, Inc., New York, N.Y. After she and Andr√© kiss, she leaves the museum, determined never to see her true love again. Meanwhile, at her home, Irene's suspicious husband reviews her daily activities with a private investigator he hired to follow her. The investigator only reports that she went to a local dog show and had an innocent encounter with Pierre (Lew Ayres), the 18-year-old son of one of Charles‚Äô business associates. Later, Irene and Charles attend a large formal dinner party. She is surprised to see Andr√©, who arrives alone and sits at the dinner table across from her dour husband. Young Pierre is at the party too, and his father informs Irene that his college-bound boy is \\"quite mad\\" about her. Andr√© and Irene do manage to meet briefly in a nearby garden, where Andr√© tells her he is moving to Paris and came to the party to see her one last time. They again express their love, kiss passionately, and part, both resolved their affair has ended. Irene then returns to the party to dance with lovestruck Pierre. The following day, after a tennis match at his parents' estate, Pierre confesses his love to Irene while Charles meets with Pierre's father to discuss his failing business and need for money. Back at the tennis courts, Irene is touched by Pierre's confession but makes light of his ardor, referring to him as \\"only a young boy\\". She agrees, however, to give him a photograph of herself that he can take to college. Pierre the next evening visits Irene's home to get the promised photo, and as he leaves he requests a small goodbye kiss. Irene hesitates but gives him a short kiss, which incites Pierre to grab her and press for a more intense one. Returning home, Charles sees their follow-up kiss, storms into the room, and begins to beat Pierre mercilessly. As her husband pursues the college boy into another room, Irene pleads with him to stop his assault, but he continues to batter Pierre. The room's door closes; a muffled gunshot is heard. Charles dies. Irene killed her husband to save Pierre, but before authorities are summoned, she alters the scene and timeline of the crime. To protect Pierre's reputation and herself, she tells the police her depressed husband committed suicide due to his dire finances. Investigators doubt her story and Irene is indicted for murder, prompting Andr√© to return to Lyon to defend his ex-lover. During the trial she repeatedly assures Andr√© that her husband killed himself. Courtroom testimony by Pierre's father about Charles‚Äô impending bankruptcy and \\"utter despair\\", along with Andr√©'s heartfelt declarations of Irene's innocence, convince the jury to acquit her. In the court area after the verdict, a smug Pierre tells Irene that her love for him compelled her to kill Charles; but he quickly realizes that Andr√© is her true love. Guilt-ridden for lying to Andr√©, Irene divulges the truth to him. Stunned, he sits and cradles his head in his hands, quietly reassessing his feelings. Believing she has destroyed her relationship with Andr√©, Irene is relieved when he finally stands and reaffirms his love for her. The film ends with them kissing just as three old cleaning women enter the room and announce they \\"have come to clean the Court\\".

As a player, he was generally referred to as \\"Micky\\" or \\"Mickey\\" Bear. Cricket style Bear was a pugnacious left-handed batsman who enjoyed his best cricket years as an opening batsman for Essex, though for the first half of his cricket career he batted further down the order. He was also known as an exceptional fielder: he was, his obituary in Wisden noted, \\"a pioneer of modern fielding techniques\\". It went on: \\"In an era when great athletes were still rare in English cricket, he was a stunningly good outfielder, able to move fast and throw flat, hard returns on the full from the furthest boundaries.\\" Cricket career Having played for Essex's second eleven from 1951 and appeared in minor matches for the Royal Air Force while on National Service, Bear made his first-class debut in 1954 against Derbyshire, scoring just one run in an Essex victory in a rain-affected match. He played a few more matches that season and the next for Essex's first team, and then appeared in more than half the side's matches in the 1956 season, making 98 in the match against Kent, but averaging only 17 runs per innings for the season as a whole. Wisden noted in its 1957 edition that Bear's \\"splendid fielding did much to help Essex reach a high standard in this department\\". Bear was a regular member of the Essex team in 1957, missing just four games through the season, but he scored less than 700 runs and his batting average was still just 17. He did, however, make his maiden first- class century, an innings of 123 in the match against Gloucestershire at Romford, in a game where, according to Wisden, \\"seam bowlers held the upper hand most of the time on a rather green pitch\\"; no other batsman on either side reached 40 in either innings, and Bear, batting in what was at this stage in his career his accustomed position of No 6 in the order, was the leading contributor enabling Essex to recover from 58 for five to reach a match- winning total of 306 in the first innings. There was progress in terms of both aggregate (913 first-class runs) and average (26 runs per innings) for Bear in 1958, though no further centuries. And the figures were similar in 1959, when he dropped to the second team for some matches. In 1960 and the first half of 1961, he was out of the first eleven as often as he was in it. However, recalled to the side in July 1961 and used as an opener in the match against Kent at Maidstone in the absence of the regular opener Geoff Smith, he hit 95. That set a precedent, and when Smith was injured for the first month of the 1962 season, Bear took his place as Gordon Barker's regular opening partner, and remained as an opening batsman for most of the rest of his first-class career, Smith moving down to No 3 on his return to the side. 1962 was by some distance Bear's most successful so far as a batsman. He made 1613 runs in all matches, and was Essex's leading scorer in County Championship games; his batting average rose to nearly 30 runs per innings. He made two centuries to add to his single previous effort five years earlier. Against Middlesex at Lord's in May he scored 117; and with Smith back in the team, Bear made 107 as an opener against Kent at Romford in early June. The 1962 season set the pattern for Bear for the next few years. In 1963, his season was truncated when he chipped a bone in his ankle while fielding in the match against Worcestershire at Leyton. But he had by then completed his 1000 runs for the season at an average of exactly 30. And in the match against Worcestershire at Worcester earlier in the season, he had improved his highest score, making 132 before he became Jack Flavell's 1000th first-class wicket. In 1964, he improved his highest score again, making 135 against Warwickshire at Ilford with three sixes and 17 fours. He played in every Essex match and hit 1567 runs at an average of 29.56. The following season, though, there was a reversion to Bear's pre-1962 form: he failed to score a century, fell short of 1000 runs and lost his place in the side for a month late in the season. The downturn was temporary. The 1966 season proved to be Bear's best in first- class cricket with 1833 runs and an average of more than 32. He topped the Essex batting averages in what was, admittedly, a lean year for the side, and scored the higher of only two centuries made by Essex batsmen in Championship matches all summer, 105 out of 190 in an unsuccessful run chase in a rain- affected match against Warwickshire at Birmingham. The 1967 season was another poor year for Essex, and though Bear hit his career-highest score, 137 against Glamorgan at Cardiff and another fast century, 124 out of an Essex total of 189 against Warwickshire at Westcliff, he was injured from late July and failed to complete 1000 runs. He returned to the team in 1968, when Essex awarded him a benefit, but lost form across the season and at the end of the year retired from first-class cricket to \\"take up a business appointment\\".

Buono legal case before the U.S. Supreme Court. The original cross was erected in 1934 to honor those killed in war. The cross stands on Sunrise Rock, a granite outcropping adjacent to Cima Road about south of Interstate 15, and north of Cima, California; the trailhead leading to Teutonia Peak is on the opposite side of the road, north of the monument. The area is a saddle between Cima Dome and the Ivanpah Mountains, both of which are part of the Mojave National Preserve. History The cross was erected in 1934. The caretakers of the spot were introduced to it by a prospector named John Riley Bembry, who served as a medic in World War I and was one of the veterans who established the monument. The cross has been maintained by volunteers and was reconstructed after being destroyed. It was boarded up in 2002 after lower court rulings declared it illegal because of separation of church and state constitutional concerns. On April 28, 2010, the US Supreme Court ruled on Salazar v. Buono in a 5-4 decision that sent the case back to a lower court. The high court ruled there was no violation of the separation of church and state when Congress transferred the land surrounding the cross to a veterans group. Writing for the majority, Justice Anthony Kennedy wrote, \\"The goal of avoiding governmental endorsement [of religion] does not require eradication of all religious symbols in the public realm\\". In April 2012, a land exchange to remove Sunrise Rock from the Mojave National Preserve was approved by the U.S. District Court for the Central District of California. On Veterans Day, November 11, 2012, the cross was rededicated by Henry Sandoz in a ceremony. Theft The boarded-up cross in 2006.On the night of May 9‚Äì10, 2010, the cross was cut down and stolen from its place on Sunrise Rock. National Park Service spokeswoman Linda Slater said a $125,000 reward was being offered for information leading to the arrest and conviction of the thieves. The VFW promised that the memorial would be rebuilt. \\"This was a legal fight that a vandal just made personal to 50 million veterans, military personnel and their families,\\" said National Commander Thomas J. Tradewell. Slater said that the wooden cover which had covered the cross since 2002 was reported missing on May 8, 2010, and that the cross itself had been seen on May 10 but was reported missing on May 11 by rangers who had returned to the location. The Desert Dispatch was contacted by someone claiming to have a message from the person who removed the cross. The message claimed that the cross had not been damaged or destroyed but moved by a veteran who objected to the cross being on public land. The message also claimed that a non-sectarian memorial had been brought to the site, but that unspecified technical difficulties prevented it from being put in place of the cross. On June 1, the Liberty Institute publicly offered in the Desert Dispatch to take back and care for the cross at a church in Yucca Valley, but two weeks later, the person who stole the cross had not yet responded. After the theft was reported, an atheist organization, Atheist Alliance International, offered $5,000 to go towards replacing the cross with a more inclusive and non-religious veterans' memorial, but the gesture was ignored by religious groups who insisted that the cross be restored. On May 20, 2010, park rangers discovered that a replica of the cross stolen 10 days earlier was now bolted to the base of the original. Park personnel removed it and placed it into evidence. Mojave National Park spokesperson, Linda Slater, said that since the replica is not the original disputed cross, it had to come down. \\"The park service has regulations about people putting up memorials. You can't just go to a park and put up a memorial to a family member.\\" The cross was eventually found, over away, in Half Moon Bay, California, in early November 2012.

Willem Adriaensz Key (1516K.Jonckheere, Willem Key (1516-1568) Portrait of a Humanist Painter, Brepols - 5 June 1568) was a Flemish renaissance painter. Biography Key was born in Breda, Netherlands. In 1529 he was known to be a pupil of Pieter Coecke van Aelst in Antwerp. Willem Key at the RKD. Later, together with Frans Floris, he took lessons from Lambert Lombardus in Li√®ge.Willem Key biography in Het Schilder-boeck (1604) by Karel van Mander, courtesy of the Digital library for Dutch literature He became a member of the Guild of St. Luke in Antwerp in 1540. He was a rich man who lived in a large house in the center of town near the exchange. He became specialized in flattering portraits and made a good living from theatrically posed group portraits. In van Mander's biography, he mentions several larger pieces by his hand that were burned during the Beeldenstorm. In particular he mentions a destroyed group portrait of the market-sellers on an altar of the Onze-Lieve-Vrouwekathedraal in Antwerp. This could suggest that his painting of the last supper in Dordrecht is (based on) a period group portrait of basket weavers and barrel makers, since this painting was commissioned for the altar of St John the Evangelist in the Grote Kerk, Dordrecht, and at that time (c. 1560) St John was the patron saint of the coopers. Betrayal - theme of his life as well as of his painting? Karel van Mander goes on to say that while Key was painting Fernando √Ålvarez de Toledo, Duke of Alba's portrait, he pretended he could not understand foreign speech, and so he overheard the Bloed-raedt plot against the statesmen Lamoral, Count of Egmont and Philip de Montmorency, Count of Hoorn. When these men were executed on the main square in Brussels on 5 June 1568, he was so upset that he died on the same day, in Antwerp. This story was widely accepted as the truth, but van Mander found it hard to believe and thinks he died a few days beforehand. In any case, many of his paintings were destroyed, while he is best known today for his portrait of the Duke of Alva, that was copied many times. The surviving last supper is still in the original frame with a Latin inscription around it with the words of Luke 22:21-23 which are translated as: > But, behold, the hand of him that betrayeth me [is] with me on the table. > And truly the Son of man goeth, as it was determined: but woe unto that man > by whom he is betrayed! And they began to enquire among themselves, which of > them it was that should do this thing. -- Luke 22:21-23 KJV According to the Rijksmuseum, Adriaen Thomasz Key was a distant relation and his pupil.

The suprapedal gland or mucous pedal gland is an anatomical feature found in some snails and slugs. It is a gland located inside the front end of the foot of gastropods.Barker G. M.

CABI Publishing, Oxon, UK, . 1-146, cited page: page 12. The term suprapedal means \\"above the foot\\". The function of this gland is to produce mucus. The gland opens on the front end of the sole, on the ventral side of the foot. The mucus produced by this gland becomes a thin layer covering the sole of the foot, and this helps the gastropod in moving. There are gland cells in the suprapedal gland. For example, in the suprapedal gland of the land snail Pomatias elegans there are three types of gland cells: cells producing mucoproteins, cells producing proteins and cells producing sulphated mucopolysaccharides.Shirbhate R. & Cook A. (1987). \\"Pedal and opercular secretory glands of Pomatias, Bithynia and Littorina\\". Journal of Molluscan Studies 53(1): 79-96.

The film, released with a synchronized score and sound effects, was based on a 1924 best-selling novel by Michael Arlen, The Green Hat, which he adapted as a four-act stage play in 1925. The Green Hat was considered so daring in the United States that the movie did not allow any associations with it and was renamed A Woman of Affairs, with the characters also renamed to mollify the censors.Eames, John Douglas, The MGM Story, 1981 In particular, the film script eliminated all references to heroin use, homosexuality and syphilis that were at the core of the tragedies involved. The film was nominated for an Academy Award for Best Writing, for Michael Arlen and Bess Meredyth's script. In 1934, MGM made a remake of the film starring Constance Bennett, titled Outcast Lady. Plot Greta Garbo and John Gilbert in A Woman of Affairs Diana Merrick (Greta Garbo), Neville (John Gilbert) and David (Johnny Mack Brown) were playmates as children, members of the rich British aristocracy. Diana and Neville are in love, but his father (Hobart Bosworth) opposes the match, disapproving the Merrick family's lifestyle. Neville is sent to Egypt for business purposes and to become wealthy. Diana, after waiting in vain for two years for Neville's return, finally marries David, who is also in love with her and good friends with her brother Jeffry (Douglas Fairbanks Jr.). During their honeymoon David commits suicide. Diana does not explain the reasons behind her husband's action, except to say, \\"He died for decency.\\" Jeffry, who was deeply connected to David, blames his sister for his friend's death; he falls deeper into alcohol as his sister starts a reckless life, seducing man after man. Years later, Neville returns to England to marry Constance (Dorothy Sebastian). Jeffry is now gravely ill, and Diana brings Dr. Trevelyan, a family friend, to his bedside and then leaves since Jeffry still refuses to see her. As she starts to drive away, she sees Neville who has followed her and Dr. Trevelyan in a cab. Diana and Neville go to his apartment, realize they are still in love, and spend that one night together. During the night Jeffry dies. Dr. Trevelyan goes to Neville's apartment in the morning to give him the news and discovers that Diana has spent the night there. Three days later, Neville marries Constance. About nine months go by: Diana falls ill (in the script she is supposed to have suffered a miscarriage, but because of censorship, this couldn't be mentioned) and is visited by Neville. Diana professes her love for him before realizing Constance is in the room. The reason for David's suicide is revealed: he was a thief, pursued by the police. Diana, realizing that her and Neville's love will ruin Neville, tells him that his wife is pregnant and sends him away. Diana drives her car into a tree, in front of which she and Neville had fallen in love and sworn eternal fidelity. Censorship In the popular novel on which the film was based, The Green Hat, David commits suicide because he suffers from syphilis, not because of a criminal background. This critical plot element was excised during scripting by the Hays Commission.Morris Ernst and Pare Lorentz, (1930). Censored: The Private Life of the Movie, New York: Jonathan Cape. p. 17-19.

They played in the Welsh Premier division of the Rugby League Conference at Aberavon Green Stars RFC. History Aberavon Fighting Irish were formed in 2003 and joined the newly formed Welsh division of the Rugby League Conference. The club rebranded as Neath Port Talbot Steelers in 2007. The Steelers soldiered through many storms only to record two wins during the league fixtures, however, this was enough to cement a place in the first round of the play-offs. They turned over Torfaen Tigers to progress to the semi- final against the Titans in Newport. The match against the Titans however, proved to be a bridge too far as the Steelers were well beaten on the day. The 2008 campaign was to be of a different set of fortunes for the Steelers. A lot of work had been made to see an improvement, with better standing in the league and a step forward, however with much disruption off the field with many players out injured for most, and in some cases, the entire season and a couple away with international duty and losing key backroom staff for some of the season, it took its toll on the field. Only one win was recorded in what was a long and hard-fought season. The 2009 season saw them only one game in the whole campaign. They were struck with ground issues and injuries which led them to have the worst season in history. The junior sides had very good seasons with the U15's winning the league, and the U17's coming runners-up. This will put the Steelers in good sted for the future. The 2010 season was slow starting due to the league kicking off late as several West Wales clubs failed to complete any fixtures. The steelers narrowly lost the first two fixture against Merthyr Wildcats and Dyffryn Devils, then with a late recruitment push dominated the remaining fixtures with good wins over Torfaen Tigers and revenge over Dyffryn Devils, the Wildacts couldn't play the repeat fixture to union players having commitments.

It's either a super-Earth or a Neptune-like planet, orbiting at 0.046 AU from the star, taking 3.7 days or 89 hours to make one round trip around the star. Discovery The discovery of the planet was announced in February 2009, during the First Corot Symposium. It was discovered during the follow-up started in order to confirm the existence of CoRoT-7b, a super-Earth uncovered by the CoRoT mission. However, unlike CoRoT-7b, it was not detected by the transit method from the CoRoT satellite, but only by the radial velocity method using HARPS from La Silla Observatory, Chile. A posteriori search of transits of CoRoT-7c in the lightcurve of the star CoRoT-7 yielded a negative result, confirming the planet is not transiting. As a consequence no radius measurement is available, and no density and structure models of the planet can be established. Characteristics Like CoRoT-7b, the mass of CoRoT-7c is weakly constrained, since the radial velocity data is noisy due to the presence of stellar activity. Published mass measurements range from 8.4 Earth masses to 13.5 Earth masses, passing through 12.4 Earth masses and 13.1 Earth masses. This mass range encompasses the Super-Earths to Neptunes transition, so the nature of CoRoT-7c, either a rocky planet or an ice giant, remains unclear. However, if the larger mass estimates are correct, CoRoT-7c is probably a hot Uranus-like planet. Chances are high that planet's rotation is tidally locked to the orbital period, with one side of the planet always facing the star CoRoT-7 and the other one in permanent darkness. A possible third planet, CoRoT-7d, may be present in the system, but pending further observations its status remains unconfirmed. If this planet is confirmed, strong mutual gravitational forces could be exchanged between these planets, leading to powerful tidal forces. Doubts about existence A published study cast doubt on CoRoT-7c's existence, arguing that the combined presence of stellar activity and additional errors on HARPS radial velocity measurements preclude a meaningful search for additional companions besides CoRoT-7b. However, all the other studies seem to confirm the planet's existence: the signal in the HARPS data of CoRoT-7c is detected in analysis of different type, does not seem to be correlated with stellar activity and is stronger than the signal associated with the confirmed CoRoT-7b. The remarkable stability and precision showed by the HARPS spectrograph also speaks in favour of the detection. The status of CoRoT-7c seems very well confirmed.

It is considered one of the most significant books of Norwegian literature of the Occupation. It was immediately translated into several other languages. In 1947 the great treason trials were still going on. The legal system considered the actions of individuals and admonished suitable punishment for those actions considered as treason. Many felt that the trials needed to investigate deeper. They should consider not only what the traitors had done during the war. They should also investigate why Nazism appealed to some and not to others. Meeting at the Milestone came as an important contribution in this debate. The goal of the novel was to show how each individual was responsible for Nazism and also towards other people. The theme of the novel is therefore guilt and responsibility. The novel is written in first person. Everything is seen from the perspective of the narrator. The narrative is about the actions of the main character as well as his thoughts and reflections. The only name used for the \\"I\\" is the nickname \\"The spotless one\\". Synopsis The novel starts with a short and mysterious prologue, Frontkjemperen (The eastern front volunteer), allegedly written in 1947. The narrator talks about \\"I\\", \\"he\\" who got eight years, \\"his father\\" who committed suicide, and \\"her\\" who \\"I\\" have not spoken with since 1945. Even though this is the fate of strangers, \\"I\\" will organise some personal notes. The first part of the book is written immediately after this, still in 1947. It talks about the time before 1943 when \\"I\\" wrote the second part of the book. He talks about the house that he has bought after lengthy negotiations with the master builder. He lost his family early during the occupation, and he was also imprisoned for a couple of weeks. By the resistance he was called \\"The spotless one\\", a nickname he quite appreciated. The leader of the resistance decided that his house was suitable for hiding people who needed to go into hiding. One day in 1943 a man named Indregaard came to the house. The spotless one knew of him already. Indregaard was depressed and needed to talk about his problems with The spotless one. The conversation soon got to a common acquaintance, Hans Berg, who was a Nazi. Indregaard thought that because of what happened in their youth he was responsible for Hans Berg's Nazism. The spotless one now starts writing about Hans Berg in order to find out why some people turn to Nazism. This part, which is written in 1943, starts with an analysis of Hans Berg's childhood and youth. The spotless one fails at his analysis. He then tries to analyse others of his fellow students who became Nazis, amongst them Carl Heidenreich, simply and superficially. Again he fails. It becomes evident that it is his own past he wants to analyse. He describes his childhood, his father, his time as a student in Kristiania, and his first erotic experiences. After a couple of brief relationships he meets \\"Kari\\". He stops mid-sentence as he reveals that \\"Kari\\" fell pregnant. The third part is written in Sweden in 1944. The spotless one had to flee after an assignment in the southern part of the country. He was assigned with tracing an informant in a small town. The informant turned out to be his own son by \\"Kari\\". She was married to Carl Heidenreich, and her real name was Maria. The spotless one let himself get captured by the Nazis, and was interrogated by Heidenreich. After the torture, or redemption, he experienced a 'vision' where he saw it all. He was rescued by Kari/Maria. He realised during the escape that he was responsible for the downfall of his family. The final part of the novel is written in 1947. The spotless one visited Maria when he came back to Norway. He was told that Carl Heidenreich had committed suicide, and that his son, Karsten, had been arrested. Finally he describes fragments of his 'vision'.

Causes and background  The causes of the war go back as far as the year 1371. The town had successfully held its ground against Duke Magnus despite heavy losses. In all its debts amounted to 100,000 marks at the time, which the citizens did not want to discharge by themselves. The officiating Wittenberg nobility decreed that, to reduce the debt, every resource available to the town (including the saltworks) had to be used. That affected the master salters (S√ºlfmeister) who leased the saltworks. They did not want to pay so much, however, and demanded as council members that the prelates of the surrounding villages, who owned the business, should be more heavily taxed. The prelates refused to comply, arguing that the L√ºneburg townsfolk were abusing their power and making excessive demands of the saltworks. The prelates succeeding in having the town excommunicated; this was rescinded again in 1374. The prelates then agreed to increase their financial contribution on the condition that their property was protected. This concession was repeatedly confirmed (until the last occasion in 1388), because L√ºneburg's debts continued to grow as a consequence of the L√ºneburg War of Succession.  Intensification of the conflict  Over the next 40 years the situation in L√ºneburg eased despite increased political instability outside the town gates. That changed however on the death of Boldewin von Wenden in 1441, who had acted continuously as a mediator between the council and the prelates. The prelates now paid 25% of their income to the town; nevertheless its debts rose to 550,000 marks in 1450. That was due, on the one hand, to the construction of a second town wall, and, on the other, to unplanned levies required by the nobility. In 1445 the dispute intensified sharply when the council demanded no less than half the salt profits from the prelates. In point of fact, the monasteries were prepared to pay this after a while, but the provost of L√ºne, Diderik Schaper, gave the prelates to believe that, at the last moment, the council would make further excessive demands. L√ºneburg lost its credibility as a result of the dispute. In 1451 the pope sent a representative who decided that the prelates should pay. But shortly thereafter this instruction was revoked again. When Schaper was removed from office by the council and not reinstated as demanded by the clergy when the ultimatum expired, the council was excommunicated. That initially had no effect because clergymen who refused to hold services for town council members were summoned to the town hall where they were advised to leave. In October 1454 the excommunication order was finally reinforced and extended. The citizens were given 30 days to drop their demands or the ban would be extended again. A visit to the pope by the council met with no success. The mood of the citizens changed at the news and despite a town hall meeting the citizens put a council together of 60 people and demanded the keys to the town gates and wall towers. The old council agreed in order to stave off a revolt.  The new council and the 60s  After further discussions the personal freedom of the old council was finally guaranteed, if they stood down from office voluntarily. This happened straight away. The prelates made 2 demands of the new council elected from the 60: firstly, that 285,000 marks should be paid back to them from the private estates of the old council and, secondly, that all tax income should be used to pay off the debts. This generated anger and suffering especially because many did not accept that the town taxes had arisen in recent years, but were the result of costs going back much further and which had been inherited by the old town council. Regardless, the old council members were ousted from the council on 12 December 1454 and placed under house arrest. Johan Springintgut requested at time to consider and was on the personal order of Schaper (now the town legal advisor) was banished to the dungeons where he died shortly thereafter on 15 July 1455.  Intervention of the emperor and resolution of the conflict  In 1456 Diderich Springintgut, brother of Johan, and his friend Nikolas Stoketo appeared in person to the emperor and requested compensation for the death and the intervention of the emperor in the escalating conflict. This request had unexpected success. The emperor ordered the immediate reinstatement of the old council and disbandment of the new one. In L√ºneburg, Schaper however tore the emperor's edict from the church door, an act which, however, did not prevent the citizens from knowing of the instruction. Schaper's deed disgusted many L√ºneburg folk so greatly, that on 10 November that year there was a spontaneous, albeit bloodless, revolt on the market place. The new council conceded that the old council could be released from arrest and reinstated in their former office. Just under 2 weeks later it was officially recognised by Duke Bernard. In 1458 two former guards of Springintgut were placed on trial, Schaper lost his office and recognition and had to leave the town. After further confusion and repeated declarations, extensions and rescinding of excommunication orders and charges of imperial outlawry the conflict with the prelates subsided, when in 1464 in Reinfeld a compromise in the shape of a treaty was agreed. Shortly afterwards the excommunication and outlawry orders were finally lifted.  Consequences  The Reinfeld Treaty enabled the town of L√ºneburg, to settle the bulk of its debts, the peace agreement with the emperor and the pope paved the way for new opportunities for trade and the Hanseatic League had proved that it could protect towns from the predations of the princes.

In 1488 Venafro was elected professor of law at the University of Siena. In November 1493 Antonio was elected Appellate Judge. As such he was arrested by the avant-garde of Charles VIII and forced to follow them in their march to Rome. He was freed a few days later only by a direct order of the King himself. A trusted adviser and private secretary of the Lord of Siena, Pandolfo Petrucci, he was named by the latter counselor and prime minister. In the month of October 1502 Venafro represented Pandolfo Petrucci at the Diet of La Magione; and later he went to Imola with Paolo Orsini, where a peace agreement was signed between Cesare Borgia and the conspirators of La Magione represented by Paolo Orsini. Venafro was a statesman of high calibre, appreciated and respected by men such as Guicciardini, Vettori and Niccol√≤ Machiavelli. In chapter 22 of The Prince, where private counselors are discussed, Machiavelli describes Venafro as an excellent minister.

Situated at an ancient site that shows evidence of habitation as early as the Iron Age, it was known as Bet She'arayim in the Roman and Byzantine periods and became an important center of Jewish learning in the 2nd century, with habitation continuing during the Early Islamic period and limited signs of activity from the Crusader period. The village appears under the name Sheikh Bureik in 16th century Ottoman archives. Named for a local Muslim saint to whom a shrine was dedicated that remains standing to this day, it was a small village whose inhabitants were primarily agriculturalists. Rendered tenant farmers in the late 19th century after the Ottoman authorities sold the village lands to the Sursuk family of Lebanon, the village was depopulated in the 1920s after this family of absentee landlords in turn sold the lands to the Jewish National Fund. A new Jewish settlement, also named Sheikh Abreik, was established there in 1925. Excavations at the site in 1936 revealed the ancient city, known in Greek as Besara and identified as Beth Shearim by Benjamin Mazar. The excavated part of the ancient town has become the Beit She'arim National Park, which is managed by the Israel Nature and Parks Authority. Name The site is first mentioned in the writings of Josephus, the 1st-century Jewish historian under the name Besara. The Arab village was named for a Muslim saint (wali) known as Sheikh Abreik for whom a two-domed shrine was erected which is still a site of pilgrimage (ziyara). The name translates from Arabic into English as \\"the sheikh of the small pitcher\\".Mazar, 1976, p. 34. It has also been suggested that the name Abreik recalls the name of Barak, the military general mentioned in the Bible's Book of Judges as the son of Abinoam.Sharon, 2004, p. xxxviii Following excavations in 1936 of an ancient city located on the hill upon which the village had been located, Benjamin Mazar identified the site as Beth Shearim, and this has been the official name of the site ever since, although the more accurate ancient name had been Bet She'arayim. Sheikh Bureik part of excavations 1944 Sheikh Abreik shrine A small double-domed Maqam (shrine) holding the tomb of a Muslim saint, Sheikh Abreik or Ibreik, stands on the ridge of the hill and is still a site of ziyƒÅrah-type pilgrimage. At the time of the Survey of Western Palestine, its interior was painted red.Conder, 1887, p. 254 Gottlieb Schumacher noted in the 1890s that: \\"The shrine of Sheik Abreik is still highly venerated by the Bedouin of the Merj ibn Amir. According to their tradition the Sheikh lived [before] the Prophet; it is a fact, that if you take an oath from a Bedawy, and make him swear by Sheikh Abreik, he will not deceive you.\\"Schumacher, 1899, pp. 340‚Äì341 Tawfiq Canaan, the Palestinian physician and ethnographer, who wrote about the shrine of Sheikh Abriek in 1927, noted that it was also a site frequented by women seeking to remedy infertility: \\"After a barren woman has taken a bath in el- Matba'ah she washes herself in Ein Ishaq [\\"Spring of Isaac\\"]; she goes then to ash-shekh Ibreik to offer a present.\\"Canaan, 1927, p. 111. Cited in Sharon, 2004, p. xxxix.Sufian, 2007, p. 51 Sheikh Abreik is described by Moshe Sharon as a local saint believed to have bestowed the nearby swamp of al-Matba'ah with healing properties that were said to be useful in treating rheumatism and nervous disorders.Sharon, 2004, p. xxxix Sharon sees the possibility that an Abbasid-period poem found written on the wall of a nearby catacomb might mark the beginning of the maqƒÅm of Shaykh Abreik. History=Iron Age Pottery shards discovered at the site indicate that a first settlement there dates back to the Iron Age. Roman and Byzantine periods Beit She'arayim was founded at the end of the 1st century BCE, during the reign of King Herod.Benjamin Mazar, Beth She'arim : Report on the Excavations during 1936‚Äì1940, Vol. I, p19. The Roman Jewish historian Josephus Flavius, in his Vita, referred to the city in Greek as Besara, the administrative center of the estates of Queen Berenice in the Jezreel Valley. Basalt-stone pavement at Sheikh Bureik (Beit Shearim ruin) in Lower Galilee After the destruction of the Second Temple in 70 CE, the Sanhedrin (Jewish legislature and supreme council) moved to Beit She'arayim. The town is mentioned in rabbinical literature as an important center of Jewish learning during the 2nd century. Rabbi Judah the Prince (Yehudah HaNasi), head of the Sanhedrin and compiler of the Mishna, lived there and was buried there, as were many other Jews from all over the country and from the Jewish diaspora from nearby Phoenicia to far away Himyar in Yemen.H.Z.

An earthquake in 386 caused some damage, but the town recovered and enjoyed prosperity during the era of Byzantine rule. Almost 300 inscriptions primarily in Greek, but also in Hebrew, Aramaic, and Palmyrene were found on the walls of the catacombs containing numerous sarcophagi. Early Islamic period From the beginning of the Early Islamic period (7th century), settlement was sparse.Mazar, p20. Excavations uncovered 75 lamps dating to the period of Umayyad (7th‚Äì8th centuries) and Abassid (8th‚Äì13th centuries) rule over Palestine. =Glassmaking industry= In 1956, a bulldozer working at the site unearthed an enormous rectangular slab, 11√ó6.5√ó1.5 feet, weighing 9 tons. Initially, it was paved over, but it was eventually studied and found to be a gigantic piece of glass. A glassmaking furnace was located here in the 9th century during the Abbasid period, which produced great batches of molten glass that were cooled and later broken into small pieces for crafting glass vessels.The Mystery Slab of Beit She'arim, Corning Glass Museum =Poem from Abbasid period= An elegy written in Arabic script typical of the 9‚Äì10th century and containing the date AH 287 or 289 (AD 900 or 902) was found in the Magharat al-Jahannam (\\"Cave of Hell\\") catacomb during excavations conducted there in 1956. Composed by the previously unknown poet Umm al-Qasim, whose name is given in acrostic in the poem, it reads as follows:Sharon, 2004, p. xli ::: > I lament the defender (who passed away) ::::While desire within his breast > is still afire. :::His generosity was not very manifest to the eye, ::::So > that the envious ones neglect desiring him. :::Yearning (for him) has made > his resting place ::::(a site of) wakefulness and a shrine where people > stay. :::The blessing of beauty he enjoyed.

Factual background A family trust was created by Mrs. Donner, who lived in Pennsylvania. The trust was incorporated in Delaware, and a Delaware bank was the trustee. Donner later changed her state of domicile upon moving to Florida where she eventually died. The will was admitted to probate in Florida, and the court addressed the question of whether the Florida court or the Delaware trustee had jurisdiction over the trust. Decision The Court decided that the Florida court lacked jurisdiction based on the minimum contacts test that had developed over the course of several decades of Supreme Court Jurisprudence. The trust company had no substantial business with Florida and no offices in Florida. The only contact with Florida was the fact that Donner moved there, which was ruled insufficient to support jurisdiction.Yeazell, C. Civil Procedure, Seventh Edition.
